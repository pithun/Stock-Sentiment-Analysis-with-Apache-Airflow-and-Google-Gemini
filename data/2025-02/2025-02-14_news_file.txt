Tesla is getting more blowback from Elon Musk’s efforts to take over the federal government.
by  Andrew J. Hawkins
Protestors are planning more demonstrations outside Tesla showrooms nationwide this weekend, as Elon Musk’s polarizing behavior and political activities within the Trump administration continue to have negative side effects on his electric car business.
The protests are being advertised on BlueSky under the tags “Tesla Takeover” and “Tesla Takedown,” similar to demonstrations held last weekend. At least three dozen events are listed on Action Network’s website, with a banner urging people who own Tesla vehicles or stock in the company to divest, sell their vehicle, and “join the picket line.”
It’s unclear how many people will join the demonstrations, and whether there is even a clear leader behind the movement. Alex Winter, a progressive activist and actor who played Bill in Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure, posted about it on BlueSky.
Still, it’s a sign that Musk’s company as well as the millions of vehicles that he has sold continue to serve as a target for people angry and frustrated by the unelected billionaire’s efforts to take over the federal government at Trump’s behest, shutting down whole agencies and targeting federal workers for layoffs.
It has led to vandalism in some cases. Social media is rife with images of Tesla vehicles defaced with swastikas or slapped with stickers of Musk throwing a fascist salute at Trump’s inauguration. Earlier this month, police in Arcata, Cali., received several reports of Tesla owners finding threatening notes on their cars, warning them to sell their cars or risk the consequences. “No Nazis in America,” several of the fliers read, according to local reports.
Several Tesla shareholders have expressed a desire for a change in leadership at the company, worried that Musk’s growing polarizing reputation could significantly impact the company’s financial future. But that seems unlikely in the near term, given Musk’s broad shareholder support. Still, Tesla’s stock price has plummeted 30 percent from its all-time high in December, including a 21 percent selloff since Trump’s inauguration, ABC reports. Tesla sales were down year over year in 2024 for the first time in over a decade. And the company appears to be in free fall in Europe, plummeting in several key markets like Norway, France, and Spain, Wired found.
For years, Tesla’s fortunes have been inextricably linked to attitudes toward its controversial CEO. When people thought Musk was going to usher in a brighter future, full of robotaxis and trips to Mars, the value of the company went up like one of his rocket ships. But now that he’s being labeled a fascist while leading a shadowy effort to root out “DEI” and “woke ideology” in the federal government, Musk is becoming more of a liability than an asset.

Russia's plan to develop one of its vast untapped lithium reserves is hitting major roadblocks.

        Russia sits on an estimated one million tons of lithium, an amount comparable to the US.
    

        Lithium is used to make lithium-ion batteries, and has been in increasing demand since the EV boom.
    

        With oil and gas sanctions weighing on Russia's economy after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, mining lithium is becoming more attractive.
    

        ""The production of this metal is, without exaggeration, a strategically important task,"" President Vladimir Putin said in the fall.
    

        But a slowing market, US sanctions and a complex mining environment are challenging this ambition, experts told Business Insider.
    

        It's a wide-ranging ambition: Russia has struck international deals and currently occupies Ukrainian land believed to hold lithium deposits.
    

        The jewel in Russia's lithium crown is the Kolmozerskoye field in Murmansk in the country's arctic northwest.
    

        Polar Lithium was set up in 2023 as a joint venture between the state nuclear energy company Rosatom and the privately-owned metals giant Nornickel.
    

        There is technical backing from the Chinese engineering firm MCC International Incorporation.
    

        It's projected to come online by 2030 and produce some 45,000 tons a year — putting it roughly on a par with Chile, the world's second-largest producer.
    

        Rosatom has said that Russia aims to become self-sufficient for lithium and capture 10% of the global market by 2030, catapulting it ahead of the US and into the world's top five producers.
    

        On January 10, the outgoing administration of former President Joe Biden imposed a slew of sanctions on Russia's energy sector.
    

        On its list was Polar Lithium, an inclusion that could spook China's involvement.
    

        Writing last year, analyst Vita Spivak said sanctions could ""limit the further integration of China and Russia's metals supply chains, as Chinese firms would be wary of being targeted by Western secondary sanctions.""
    

        Speaking to BI in the wake of the recent US announcement, Pavel Devyatkin of The Arctic Institute agreed.
    

        ""The sanctioning of Polar Lithium creates risks for the Chinese company and may affect the company's plans,"" he said.
    

        ""Chinese companies have not shown a willingness to challenge US sanctions, including in the Arctic economy.""
    

        Philip Andrews-Speed, a senior research fellow at Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, also said that China has been ""very careful"" about investment in Russia's energy sector.
    

        ""My guess is that the Chinese might withdraw, or just slow things down,"" he said.
    

        The extent of MCC's involvement in the project is unclear — Rosatom's announcement described its technical know-how in extracting and processing but didn't talk about what sort of payment it would get, whether in cash or in the form of mined lithium.
    

        Laurence Haar, a financial economist specializing in energy markets at the UK's University of Brighton, told BI that a so-called offtake agreement, giving away some of the product, is likely the only way Russia can pay for China's expertise. China has used that model in lithium projects elsewhere.
    

        Asked about the extent of MCC's involvement both before and after the sanctions, Polar Lithium spokesperson Vasily Zakharov told BI: ""The project continues to advance in accordance with its planned timeline and operational objectives.""
    

        Business Insider wasn't able to reach MCC; a listed email address was inactive.
    

        Lithium is often hailed as ""white gold"" or ""the oil of the 21st century"" — but for the time being it's not that rare.
    

        Despite a rise in prices during the EV boom, oversupply cooled the market in 2024.
    

        The lithium market ""has become highly competitive,"" Ahmed Mehdi, another senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, told BI by email. China gets plenty from its domestic industry as well as from Australia and Africa, he said.
    

        Mehdi added that it's also difficult to know how much investment would be needed to make Polar Lithium commercially viable, ""particularly given potential infrastructure constraints and market opportunities (given its sanctions profile).""
    

        Those infrastructure constraints are considerable, Haar told BI, and ""would be challenging at the best of times.""
    

        Working in the remote and cold High North requires significant transport and civilian infrastructure just to get going, he said, which will add to production costs.
    

        This makes Russia's ambition of taking up 10% of the world's market ""a bit optimistic,"" Haar said, adding: ""I don't see it as a threat to the market.""
    

        This doesn't mean the project is dead in the water.
    

        Lithium mining isn't a complex process, and Andrews-Speed, the OIES academic, said Russia could move ahead without Chinese cooperation in the hopes that sanctions will be lifted later.
    

        Since taking office, President Donald Trump has overturned some of the Biden administration's sanctions. The State Department declined to comment on its plans for Polar Lithium's sanctions.
    

        Even under sanctions, it would not be hard to quietly sell the unprocessed lithium, Haar told BI. Russia has taken a similar approach with its oil and gas.
    

        ""Once it's turned into batteries and processed into oxide, no one can know from where it came,"" he said.
    

        But the real money is in processing it, he added.
    

        ""The Chinese have cornered the market in processing lithium,"" he said. ""Which is smart because beneficiation, moving downstream into producing the oxide, and then actually producing batteries, is where you make the money.""

A staple of the country's cuisine, rice has seen soaring prices in Japan, prompting the government to step in with its own stockpiles in a bid to stabilize the market.

        Taku Eto, Japan's agriculture minister, announced at a press conference Friday that the government will release up to 210,000 tons of rice kept aside for emergencies.
    

        The latest average retail price of an 11-pound bag of rice in Japan was 3,688 Japanese yen, about $24, The Guardian reported, citing a government survey, up from about $13 last year.
    

        Core consumer price index data released by Japan's internal affairs ministry at the end of January showed that the price of rice rose 70.7% year-on-year in the 23 wards of Tokyo, the capital.
    

        In comparison, the price in the US for the same quantity of rice is $11, according to the US Bureau of Labor.
    

        The first 150,000 tons of government rice will be auctioned to wholesalers next month, and is expected to reach retailers in late March or early April.
    

        Eto said he hoped releasing rice from the stockpile would help ""normalize"" the market and distribution.
    

        The price spike began last fall, when the price of newly harvested rice in Japan reached its highest level in 31 years.
    

        Rising labor and fertilizer costs due to inflation, a summer heat wave, and increased demand from an unprecedented number of tourists helped drive the rise.
    

        But Eto attributed the price hike to a distribution bottleneck, saying at the press conference that enough rice is being produced to meet demand.
    

        US consumers are also struggling with soaring prices, notably of eggs. Egg prices in the US are at an all-time high, caused in large part by a bird flu crisis that has wiped out an estimated 7% of the national flock.
    

        Some US grocery stores are cracking down on how many eggs a shopper can buy at one time, and the average price of a dozen Grade A large eggs in the US has hit an all-time high of $4.95.
    

        Japan started stockpiling rice in 1995, after a major crop failure in the early 1990s. It generally only taps into its reserves in response to unusually poor harvests or natural disasters.
    

        On Wednesday, the Bank of Japan's governor, Kazuo Ueda, warned that food prices in the country could remain high.
    

        He also said that the bank was ""deeply aware"" that this was negatively impacting people's lives.

Gavin Kliger, a former Databricks software engineer who joined Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, published a Substack post on Friday explaining why he walked away from ""millions of dollars, prestige, and a life of comfort"" in tech to address what he called ""institutional failure"" and ""systemic corruption"" in government.

DOGE has hired mostly early- to mid-career tech professionals and recent college grads, many of whom have little or no government experience. Kliger is one of them.
    

        Kliger's LinkedIn profile indicates that after graduating from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2020, he worked as a software engineer at startup Databricks before becoming a ""Senior Advisor to the Director for Technology and Delivery"" at the US Office of Personnel Management under DOGE in January. Business Insider was not able to independently verify his DOGE title, and Kliger did not respond to a request for comment.
    

        In his Substack post, Kliger explained why he walked away from his tech job to join DOGE.
    

        ""The numbers were staggering — stock grants, bonuses, a Silicon Valley salary — stacked against a bureaucratic grind at the Department of Government Efficiency,"" Kliger wrote. ""But this isn't another story about leaving tech for government work. It's about watching vital systems degrade, one by one, until the only rational response is to step in and fix them.""
    

        Kliger said he felt compelled to join DOGE because he believes the government has been stifling conservative viewpoints, forcing people to comply with arbitrary mandates, and getting bogged down with bureaucracy.
    

        Kliger was said to be one of the DOGE staffers who searched the offices of the US Agency for International Development in early February and demanded access to sensitive information that required special security clearances.
    

        In his Substack post, Kliger said his disillusionment with liberal institutions and viewpoints began in high school during the 2016 election and grew once he got to college.
    

        Kliger criticized Berkeley's handling of campus protests in 2017, accusing the university of allowing a mob to attack conservatives and arguing that the media falsely described the protests as ""mostly peaceful.""
    

        During a protest in August 2017, about 2,000 demonstrators were marching without incident when a group of about 100 people joined in and several violent incidents followed, The Washington Post reported.
    

        Kliger said COVID-19 restrictions pushed him further against ""bureaucratic nonsense.""
    

        ""It was never about public health,"" Kliger wrote. ""It was about power. About seeing what people would tolerate and pushing further.""
    

        Kliger argued that these weren't ""isolated failures"" but part of ""institutional failure"" and ""systemic corruption.""
    

        Kliger has been writing on Substack since November. Previous posts describe his thoughts about Trump's Cabinet selections Matt Gaetz and Pete Hegseth. When he was identified as part of DOGE, he briefly posted an article titled ""Why DOGE"" with a subscription price of $1,000 a month before removing it. He's now charging $8 a month.

8,2025-02-14,"Apple is working to bring its AI features to China as early as May, with Alibaba and Baidu acting as local partners to help the company meet strict state regulations, according to a new Bloomberg report. 
Apple is said to have dedicated teams in both China and the US working to adapt its Apple Intelligence platform for the Chinese market, as it navigates the country's complex regulatory system. 
Alibaba is Apple's primary partner in the endeavor, with the e-commerce giant reportedly building an on-device system to analyze and modify Apple's AI models for iPhone, iPad, and Mac users in China. The system will include built-in censorship and filtering capabilities to comply with Chinese government requirements. Meanwhile, Baidu will act as a secondary partner, handling features like Visual Intelligence for the upcoming iPhone 16.
The Chinese version of Apple Intelligence will differ significantly from the one featured on US Apple devices. The US version combines on-device features, server-based processing (Private Cloud Compute), and ChatGPT integration. In contrast, the Chinese version will rely heavily on local partnerships. Alibaba's software will basically be an intermediary layer that allows government-directed content filtering without the user knowing it.
The AI features that result from the partnership will only be available on Apple devices sold within China, while devices purchased elsewhere and brought into the country won't have access to the local AI system. Apple has reportedly submitted materials to Chinese authorities for approval, but it still faces some regulatory hurdles before the features can be launched.
The combined effort comes as Apple faces declining sales in China, its largest market outside the US, where local smartphone brands have gained market share partly thanks to their AI offerings.

A solid pair of headphones will beat out earbuds any day. Beats is one of the bigger names on the market for headphones and for a good reason. Right now, you can save 50% on the Beats Solo 4 on-ear Bluetooth headphones. That has brought them down to their lowest price of all time at just $100. $100 for a set of wireless headphones with high-quality sound is a pretty darn good deal, so hop on it before it’s too late and they go back up to $200.
See at Amazon
Note that the Beats Solo 4 do not support active noise cancelling or transparency mode. These are super useful features, but they can really drive up the price of a pair of headphones. If those are important deal breakers for you, consider the Beats Studio Pro. If not, you’ll still be getting a super solid pair of Bluetooth on-ear headphones for just $100.
Battery life is nothing to sneeze at. You’ll get a full 50 hours of listening time on a single charge. If you ever catch yourself having forgot to charge it and you’re about to head out of the house for the day, no worries. The Beats Solo 4 support Fast Fuel charging which only requires 10 minutes of charging time to go from zero to five full hours of battery life.
The Beats Solo 4 are a comfortable wear. The ultralight yet durable construction means you’ll be able to keep them on all day without weighing your head down. The flex-grip headband, adjustable angled ear cups, and UltraPlush ear cushions ensure they will remain stable and comfortable on heads of all shapes and sizes.
Pairing to your devices is super easy. Whether you have an iPhone or an Android, all you need to do is touch to pair. In no time, you’ll be able to enjoy all your favorite music, audiobooks, or podcasts. You can even use the built-in microphone to take calls or use your phone’s voice assistant. For high resolution lossless audio, you can connect over USB-C or the 3.5mm audio jack which I don’t care that it’s been nearly a whole decadeâI’m still angry at the phone companies for removing this perfect port.
The Beats Solo 4 on-ear Bluetooth headphones comes in four different stylish colors. Choose between slate blue, cloud pink, black/gold, or matte black. All four options are on sale right now for a full 50% off. You can secure yourself your own pair for the reduced price of just $100âits lowest price ever.

10,2025-02-14,
11,2025-02-14,"Even with the S&P 500 trading near record highs, there's always something for investors to worry about.
On Wall Street, it's called the ""wall of worry,"" and investors must continually climb it.
""Unfortunately, sometimes Mr. Market can lose his footing on the way up,"" Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Business Insider.
Some of the bricks the make up the wall of worry right now include the potential for a trade war following the Trump administration's tariffs, an ever-growing government spending deficit, and uncertainty around the longevity of the AI tech trade.
""If we get into a widespread and prolonged trade war, or some unexpected shock to the system were to occur, then the market could be at risk of a very large drop"" of 20% or more, Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management, told BI.
Then there's the fact that everyone on Wall Street seems conditioned to buy the dip.
""One of my concerns is that the longer we go without a correction, the more invulnerable investors feel, and the more emboldened that traders become about buying every dip,"" Sosnick said.
""Every so often, there is a dip that is not a buying opportunity, but instead the early stages of something more significant. That's when the problems arise,"" he added.
As for what might trigger ""something more significant,"" a sudden spike in bond yields is a likely candidate.
While the 10-year US Treasury yield has softened this year and dipped back below 4.50%, a swift rise toward 5% could trigger a stock sell-off.
Budget concerns could send yields soaring if the Trump administration follows through with more tax cuts that aren't balanced out by cuts to spending. A trade war, meanwhile, could also put upside pressure on bond yields.
""Bear in mind that foreigners buy huge quantities of US government debt. If trade or political tensions become dire enough for them to reduce their purchases, that could push yields higher by themselves,"" Sosnick said.
An ""unexpected recession"" driven entirely by outside forces could also be on the table.
""Many US investors aren't paying attention to the real estate crisis in China, but just like our real estate crisis triggered the global financial crisis, it is quite possible that a debt implosion in China could cause problems outside its borders,"" Sosnick said.
China's property sector has been mired in a crisis since the default of Evergrande Group in 2021, and the country is dealing with an enormous amount of distressed debt, much of it tied to its real estate market.  
For Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group, stocks could be due for weakness after a technical sell signal flashed in January.
It's called the December Low indicator, and it occurs when the S&P 500 closes below the December low close in the first quarter.
That signal flashed on January 10, when the S&P 500's close of 5,827 was 50 points below December's closing low of 5,867.
Since 1950, this December Low indicator has flashed a sell signal 37 times, and the results are not pretty.
""The full year returns were plain and simple much weaker,"" Detrick said in a recent note, highlighting an average full-year return of -0.2% and a win-ratio of 48.6%.
""This is one thing that undoubtedly is in my worry column,"" he added.
Finally, stock market valuations above historical levels are an ongoing concern, Charlie Ashley, portfolio manager at Catalyst Funds, said.
Ashley told BI that because mega-cap tech stocks are ""running on fumes,"" investors should consider owning less expensive areas of the market, like small-cap stocks or an equally weighted S&P 500 fund.

13,2025-02-14,"Hermès reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results on Friday, sending its stock to a record high.
The French luxury goods group's sales for the final three months of 2024 hit 3.96 billion euros ($4.16 billion), up nearly 18% and beating analyst estimates of 3.69 billion euros. 
Annual revenues rose almost 15% to 15.2 billion euros for the maker of Birkin bags, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars.
""In 2024, in a more uncertain economic and geopolitical context, the solid performance of the results attests to the strength of the Hermès model and the agility of the house's teams,"" executive chairman Axel Dumas said in a statement.
Hermès stock rose as much as 4.2% in Paris on Friday, pushing the market cap above 300 billion euros for the first time. Shares have jumped 23% this year and about 300% over the past five years.
Its market cap is getting closer to that of rival LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton despite sales being about a fifth of the Christian Dior and Givenchy owner. 
LVMH is worth about 358 billion euros after its stock dipped 10% over the past 12 months. It is up almost 13% this year, however. 
Hermès said it raised prices by 6% to 7% this year. Its strong performance comes as other luxury brands struggle amid a slump in high-end spending. 
Earlier this week, Gucci owner Kering reported a 12% decline in sales, and British luxury house Burberry announced a turnaround plan in November to help boost revenue.
Analysts at UBS wrote in a note to clients that Hermès ""delivered a solid end to the year confirming its unique business model and better trends in the sector in Q4, which disproportionately benefitted only a few players. The growth was healthy across the board with a sequential acceleration across almost all categories and regions, and especially the important Americas and APAC (ex-Japan).""
UBS has a ""buy"" rating on the stock. Hermès announced a special dividend of 10 euros per share.

Finding the Woedica’s Inheritance treasure map solution in Avowed involves a trick of perspective and possibly some unorthodox quest-finding methods, depending on your luck.
Unlike the other maps in Dawnshore, Captain Henqua’s Spoils and Intimidating Feline Codpiece, you need to make a bit of story progress before you can acquire Woedica’s Inheritance. If you favor stealth and are building a ranger or assassin-style build, though, the reward is worth the hassle.
This Avowed guide shows where to find the Woedica’s Inheritance treasure map, which location the treasure map is showing, and what you’ll find once you get there.
The Woedica’s Inheritance map is for sale at Sanza’s Emporium in Paradis’ Hightown market, an area you can only access after completing the “Strangleroot” mission. Or at least it should be there. According to our testing, in some scenarios, Sanza just doesn’t stock the map, regardless of story progress or whether you’ve completed his cartography quests.
If the map isn’t for sale, you can still find the unique item anyway, which adds the quest to your journal and considers it automatically completed.
The map shows you a path between a fortress wall and a natural rock wall. The only place in Dawnshore with intact walls of that size is Paradis, and since the natural rock wall has to be on your right, that rules out the city’s western walls. 
Start from the God’s Gate fast travel beacon, and walk north under the arch. Turn left and approach the ravine separating you from the walls of Paradis, and you’ll find a small dirt path. It leads you to a little nook that looks like a dead end, but pressing the button hidden behind some foliage on your right opens a secret panel in the wall. 
Inside is a rather ominous shrine that’s for decoration only and a chest containing your unique item, the Gloves of the Strangler.
The Gloves of the Strangler come with a standard bonus and a unique enchantment, both of which favor ranger playstyles. You can’t upgrade the item bonus, but you can enhance the enchantment at a party camp.
Strangler’s Gloves item bonus
Strangler’s Gloves enchantment
Pulling off stealth attacks is easier with ranged weapons, though if you learn the ranger’s invisibility skill Shadowing Beyond, you can use it to give yourself the same advantage using any weapon without having to hide.

If the system starts having no value, nobody will subscribe to it.  The goal of the insurance company appears to be so SEEM to produce be of large value while having to pay off as little as possible.   Some companies definitely do this by making fraudulent promises about their coverage, and not paying off unless essentially challenged in court, but such companies also have to change their names frequently, of people start avoiding them.
 In healthcare, AI company Juniper said its clients saw 80% fewer insurance claim denials and 50% faster processing times.That's almost certainly a lie. Insurance companies tend to want to deny claims. ""Everywhere we remain unfree and chained to technology, whether we passionately affirm or deny it. But we are delivered over to it in the worst possible way when we regard it as something neutral; for this conception of it, to which today we particularly like to do homage, makes us utterly blind to the essence of technology."" is how Heidegger said it.

And all their app has is the very same AI chatbot.
There have been useless support chatbots, text and audio, for a long time. This will make them more wordy and insistent on only them having solved your problem. Life's about to get much worse.
Good fucking luck speaking to a human ever again. I guess the millennials and zoomers will love it.
Bullshit. The old chatbots were and are absolute trash: Glorified forms + glorified FAQ searchers.
LLMs are heavenly compared to that. Just talk to them normally and they get what you're trying to achieve, don't follow some circuitous script and get straight to the point.
Go ahead: Whenever you have a question where you'd normally want to contact the support department of some organization, just ask the question to a general frontier LLM. Even such a general LLM is going to be way more helpful, let alone one 
>>  everyone gets to talk to an AI at the support desk
It could be a much better experience. I've been interacting with AI's recently and they respond in complete sentences, can usually infer what I was saying even if I wasn't very clear, and have immediate access to information that a human would normally have to spend time looking up. It should be at least as good as some low-payed call center flunky who hates their job and for good reason.
While that's faint praise indeed, I think it's too high.  OTOH, the last time I called it WAS easier to get through to a real tech, even if the AI was otherwise useless.
From my experience with foreign support people, and with AI, AI will be a vast improvement.

Brian Niccol, Starbucks' CEO, said the coffee chain is eyeing a major expansion into the Middle East and Chinese markets.

        In a Friday interview with Bloomberg, Niccol said that the chain's franchise operator in the Middle East, the Alshaya Group, will open 500 new stores in the region over the next five years. He said the opening of the new stores is projected to create 5,000 new jobs.
    

        Niccol also talked about a large-scale expansion in China. He said the company is focused on how to get bigger in China ""because the reality is, that market is going to continue to grow for us.""
    

        ""Today, we have over 7,000 stores. There will be many more thousands of stores in China in our future,"" he added.
    

        Niccol's comments about building Starbucks' presence in these two markets come after the brand saw losses in the Middle East last year, where it faced boycotts linked to the war in Gaza.
    

        Starbucks' finance chief said in an earnings call in April that comparable store sales outside the US fell 6% in the second quarter of 2024, largely because its Middle East business had taken a hit. Starbucks said on its website in 2023 that it had nearly 2,000 stores operated by the Alshaya Group in the Middle East and North Africa region.
    

        ""The boycott and that whole information cycle, it's really unfortunate,"" Niccol told Bloomberg.
    

        ""Because obviously, it hurts the brand, it hurts our partners in the stores, and the thing that's really disappointing about it is, it's just not based on anything that's accurate or true, you know, we've never supported any militaries,"" Niccol said.
    

        The chain also faces an uphill battle in China.
    

        The market has been flooded with offerings from budget local coffee chains like Luckin Coffee, Cotti Coffee, and KFC's coffee wing, KCOFFEE. These chains are now competing with Starbucks for buy-in from China's cost-conscious consumers.
    

        Comparable store sales in Starbucks China decreased by 6% in the latest quarter, which ended on December 29.
    

        Niccol, who took the top job at Starbucks in September, has been making big changes at the company.
    

        In October, he said he aimed to rebrand Starbucks as an inviting place for people to hang out.
    

        Niccol said on the company's January 28 earnings call that Starbucks would simplify its offerings. It would also work to reduce wait times by improving its mobile ordering process and testing a new algorithm for mobile orders.
    

        On the earnings call, Niccol and Starbucks' finance chief said the chain would cut 30% of its menu items to streamline service.
    

        Representatives for Starbucks didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider, sent outside regular business hours.

18,2025-02-14,"Home Depot has at times sold a neat spiral lamp that relies on LEDs to supply its soothing white glow. When [Craig Lindley] saw some modified versions on YouTube he decided he had to build one himself. The result is a charming rainbow lamp that really lights up a room (pardon the pun).

[Craig] first set about stripping the lamp of its white LED strips, replacing them with addressable WS2812B LEDs. No more would the lamp just output white light—any color in the RGB gamut was now on the table.
A powerful 10 amp 5 volt power supply was then installed to provide the necessary juice. A Wemos D1 Mini was pressed into service as the controller, which was also hooked up to an HC-SR04 infrared motion sensor. This provided the capacity to trigger the lamp when it detects someone moving nearby.
Alternatively, the lamp was given a time-activated mode as well. Either way, when activated, the lamp displays a range of colorful patterns on its elegant spirals, all with the aid of the popular FastLED library.
The final result is impressive—it looks almost stock, except it’s far more colorful and interesting to look at than the original. It’s also amusingly hard to display in our usual image formats because it’s so tall and narrow. In any case, we’ve seen some great lamp builds before, too. If you’re working on your own charming illuminations, don’t hesitate to drop us a line!
DNA lamp :-)
The most common DNA form turns the other way around unfortunately :-)
Bizarro World DNA maybe.
“Some modified versions on YouTube”?  I would think Dave Plummer would warrant a more direct reference here. And since I just saw that video, here ya go: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w4INVpTg9E&t=2442s
Looking at Home Depot’s web site (search for Spiral Lamp ) I found that same DNA style light as a ceiling light  https://www.homedepot.com/p/2-Light-Silver-Wave-Spiral-LED-Chandelier-HCA2415-CH/327641853 . Might be worth it to get one since it’s cheaper and have a go at it.
You mean the “early” internet scammer behind “Registry Cleaner” and “InternetShield”?
IMO he doesn’t warrant “a more direct reference” (but that’s just my opinion which in this case is not based on own “research”).
Ha! I watched the same video and also freaked out about the lamp! Now I know what it is! I didn’t find the name of the lamp on the page but: “Swirl 59 in. Black Modern 1” – cheers
Dangit Hackaday.  I blame my ADD, but I am always trying new projects I see on here.  I think you can’t be blamed for my newly acquired Pebble though 🤔.  With 2 replacement batteries I think it was still under $30.  And my favorite feature is it actually works as a watch without any smartphone!  Pleasantly surprised.
There is one for $70 obo on the great internet flea market.  Which beats Home Depot for $130, or Costco sold ourlt $99.  For $130 it should have the RGB already.
Looks more like an AM312 PIR, the HC-SR04 is an ultrasonic distance sensor.

Coined as the world’s highest penthouse, an incredible residence has been listed on the market for an impressive US$51 million—though you’ll need to furnish it yourself. Situated in the iconic Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest building, this apartment offers an extraordinary expanse of floor space and unparalleled views of the surrounding area. The property is being offered by local firm Invest Dubai Real Estate, which claims it holds the title of the world’s highest penthouse suite, perched at “over 1,300 feet” above the city. While this is quite evidently a significant altitude, without a precise measurement, we cannot confirm whether it surpasses the reported $250 million penthouse in Central Park Tower, noted by the Wall Street Journal, which sits at a height of 1,550 feet (472 meters).
This luxurious residence can be accessed via Burj Khalifa’s exclusive private elevator, ensuring a sense of exclusivity and privacy from the moment you step inside. It spans over two floors, and the home boasts an impressive 21,000 square feet of floor space, making it not only spacious but also the largest residence in Downtown Dubai. The grandeur of the home is further accentuated by floor-to-ceiling windows. Inside, you will find a bunch of impressive features, including a private swimming pool.
The space is meticulously designed to accommodate multiple bedrooms, each offering a serene retreat, as well as entertainment areas perfect for hosting guests.  It includes a range of premium amenities, such as an exclusive lounge where residents can unwind, a state-of-the-art fitness center to cater to health and wellness needs, and beautifully landscaped Japanese gardens that provide a tranquil escape. The residence also boasts a dedicated 24-hour concierge service, ensuring that all needs and desires are met with the utmost efficiency and care.






The complete absence of furniture in the penthouse is celebrated as a unique opportunity for personalization. For the discerning owner, this offers a blank canvas to truly make the space their own. Rather than simply visiting a local IKEA for standard furnishing solutions, the future occupant will likely wish to achieve an architect-designed interior. This approach will take full advantage of the expansive layout, tailoring the design to reflect personal tastes and lifestyles. By commissioning custom pieces and seeking out high-end materials, the owner can transform the penthouse into a distinctive retreat that harmonizes with its breathtaking surroundings and maximizes its luxurious potential.
“It comes as a shell-and-core unit and provides a blank canvas for buyers to craft a bespoke masterpiece, with ample space for grand entertaining areas, ultra-luxurious bedrooms, and custom amenities tailored to their vision,” adds Invest Dubai Real Estate.

Brian Chesky, the CEO of Airbnb, says he wants the company to become a travel Amazon — a one-stop shop for everything related to traveling and living.

        In a Thursday earnings call, Airbnb's chiefs said the company plans to invest $200 million to $250 million in launching new businesses and offerings on the Airbnb app. The latest offerings will be rolled out in May, Chesky said.
    

        Chesky said the platform would ""expand beyond short-term rentals into becoming an extensible platform with a range of new offerings.""
    

        ""We want the Airbnb app, kind of similar to Amazon, to be one place you go for all of your traveling and living needs,"" he said. ""A place to stay is just really, frankly, a very small part of the overall equation.""
    

        He likened Airbnb's new venture to Amazon, saying that the e-commerce giant started with books, expanded to the ""nearest adjacency,"" which was DVDs and CDs, and ""pretty soon they were doing things pretty far adjacent from media and books.""
    

        Chesky added that one of the company's goals is to get people to use the Airbnb app more often.
    

        ""We're not a very frequently used app. People typically use this once or twice a year, and I would love for it to be one day for people to use this once or twice a week,"" he said.
    

        The company reported revenues of $2.48 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024, up 12% from the same period in 2023. Its annual 2024 revenue was $11.10 billion, up 12% from 2023.
    

        Airbnb's stock price rose more than 14% in after-hours trading on Thursday.
    

        Representatives for Airbnb did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider, sent outside regular business hours.

    Apple's leaning on companies, including Chinese tech giants Alibaba and Baidu, to adapt its AI system to meet regulatory requirements, Bloomberg reports.
  
The Apple iPhone 16. 
Apple is reportedly working with local partners to bring Apple Intelligence to China later this year, including adaptations to comply with the Chinese government's expectations of keeping iPhone users from seeing information it doesn't want them to see.
The company is leaning on companies including Chinese tech giants Alibaba and Baidu to adapt its artificial intelligence system to meet regulatory requirements and provide region-specific infrastructure, according to a Bloomberg report.
In a note to investors, Dan Ives, senior equity analyst for Wedbush Securities, called the company's China strategy the ""biggest missing piece in Apple's AI launch,"" noting that it's been in a ""holding pattern"" awaiting a Chinese tech partner.
""This is a major step in the right direction for Apple as the Alibaba partnership unlocks the China AI opportunity,"" Ives told CNET. ""This is the golden goose for Apple.""
Apple did not respond to a request for comment, but Joe Tsai, chairman of Alibaba, confirmed during the the World Governments Summit in Dubai on Thursday that the companies are joining forces.
""Apple has been very selective. They talked to a number of companies in China, and in the end, they choose to do business with us. They want to use our AI to power their phones,"" he said.
The news comes as Apple looks to build momentum in China, its second-largest market, after it had seen a significant sales decline in the country. Rival companies continue to use advanced AI tools to lure customers away from the iPhone, many at more affordable prices. 
At the same time, Apple is expected to launch a more advanced yet still affordable iPhone SE next week, in a move that could help  it better compete in key markets such as China and India, where budget-friendly smartphones with premium features continue to gain traction.
According to a Bloomberg report, Apple is working with Alibaba to comply with government regulations by helping with censoring, filtering and blocking specific content to meet local standards. 
Meanwhile, Apple is reportedly teaming up with Baidu to power other features. These include Visual Intelligence, which allows people to scan and learn more about objects around them via the device's camera and information from the internet, and to replace the US version of ChatGPT integration in Siri.
Chinese law requires data to be processed on China-based servers rather than being sent to servers in other countries. It also requires companies to work with local partners to receive regulatory approval.
The company is expected to launch its adapted version of Apple Intelligence for China as early as May, the report said. The censorship will apply to iPhones and other devices sold only in China.
Apple has only rolled out Apple Intelligence to certain markets so far, including the US, Canada, UK and Australia, due to compliance and regulatory restrictions. However, the company is expected to release Apple Intelligence support for new languages, including Chinese, with iOS 18.4 in April.
Ives noted that adoption of Apple Intelligence is still in its infancy, projecting that about 25% of the global population will gain access through an Apple device in the next few years.  "

Roku stock surged by approximately 14% in pre-market trading on Friday, bringing its year-to-date gains to over 30%. The increase follows Roku’s stronger-than-expected Q4 2024 results, with total revenue climbing 22% to $1.2 billion. Roku’s platform business revenue, which includes subscription and ad sales on Roku devices, exceeded $1 billion, reflecting a 25% year-over-year increase. Separately, with uncertainty surrounding the company, see What’s Next For U.S. Steel Stock After A Mixed Q4?
Roku’s momentum continues to build. The company recently reported that its global streaming TV household count reached 89.8 million by the end of December and surpassed 90 million in early January. This represents an increase from 85.5 million in Q3 and 80 million in Q4 2023, marking a 12.5% year-over-year rise. Roku also revealed that its smart TVs and streaming boxes now reach nearly half of all U.S. broadband households, a positive development for its high-margin platform business.
Viewer engagement is increasing as more users shift from traditional television to streaming. In Q4, total streaming hours reached 34 billion, up 18% year-over-year. With its extensive data on user behavior, ad performance, and engagement, Roku has ample room for expansion. Additionally, the company has implemented cost controls, limiting operating expense growth to just 2% year-over-year—well below revenue growth. Workforce and office space reductions in 2024 contributed to this efficiency. Operating profit rose 17% to $512.6 million, while free cash flow for 2024 stood at $203 million. As prior investments in research and product development continue to bear fruit, Roku has significant potential to improve its margins. See a scenario on how Roku stock could reach $200.
ROKU stock has experienced volatility over the past four years, with yearly returns fluctuating significantly compared to the S&P 500. The stock delivered returns of -31% in 2021, -82% in 2022, 125% in 2023, and -19% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, a curated selection of 30 stocks, has been considerably less volatile while outperforming the S&P 500 over the same period. Why? HQ Portfolio stocks have historically delivered better risk-adjusted returns, avoiding the extreme fluctuations seen in ROKU stock, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. With ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties, including interest rate decisions and global conflicts, will ROKU struggle as it did in 2021, 2022, and 2024, or could it stage a recovery?

Currently, Roku stock trades at approximately 3x the consensus 2025 revenue estimate, significantly below the double-digit multiples seen in 2021. However, the company faces increasing competition for ad revenue from major players such as Netflix, Meta, and Alphabet. We estimate Roku’s fair value at $78 per share, which is below its current market price. We are updating our Roku model to reflect its Q4 earnings.

28,2025-02-14,"Chevrolet tossed its cap into the NASCAR EV crossover stock car ring on Thursday with the unveiling of the Blazer EV.R prototype ahead of this weekend’s Daytona 500. Like the Ford Mustang Mach-E stock car unveiled in January, this Blazer EV.R borrows heavily from the NASCAR EV prototype developed in collaboration with ABB and demonstrated last year. While there are now two manufacturer-built prototypes, NASCAR still hasn’t scheduled a race for the electric stock cars.
The Blazer EV.R’s body differs from the two previous electric stock cars despite sharing the crossover shape, glasshouse, and rear wing. The front fascia looks like it was ripped right off a Blazer EV SS, with inlets on both ends tucked beneath the headlight decals. While aggressive and stylish, it’s far less aerodynamic than the Mustang Mach-E’s clean, rounded fascia. I wouldn’t be surprised if the Blazer were disadvantaged in a competitive setting. Phil Zak, the executive director of Chevrolet Global Design, said in a statement:
This program was a great opportunity with NASCAR to design a new crossover utility vehicle body and bring forward design elements from our Blazer EV SS. The EV.R prototype offers lower and wider proportions and was designed with aerodynamics and performance in mind.
The Blazer EV.R exactly matches the other NASCAR electric stock cars on the spec sheet. It has a tri-motor all-wheel-drive layout with a 78-kWh liquid-cooled battery. The crossover’s powerplant can produce over 1,300 horsepower, over double the output of the Blazer EV SS. Justin Allgaier, Chevy’s test driver and 2024 NASCAR Xfinity Series Champion, said:
“There are so many things you don’t think about until you’re in the car actually testing it. I’m used to knowing my speed through gearing and listening to engine revs, so I had to totally change how I judge corner entry speed. With this platform we’re learning how to strategically adjust regenerative braking, which has a big impact on braking sections and cornering balance.”
The Blazer EV SS is set to be the pace car during Sunday’s Daytona 500. Considering the lengthy delays with the EV SS, it’s incredible to think that the stock car prototype was likely conceived, developed and revealed before a customer touched a keyfob for the road-going model. Toyota is now the sole NASCAR Cup Series OEM without an electric stock car prototype."

West Pharmaceutical Services, a global provider of solutions for drugs, biologics, gene therapies, and consumer healthcare products, recently announced its Q4 results, surpassing analysts’ expectations for both revenue and earnings. The company reported sales of $749 million and adjusted earnings per share of $1.82, compared to $740 million and $1.73, respectively. However, its future guidance fell short of market expectations, leading to a decline in its stock price after the announcement. Separately, with uncertainty surrounding the company, see What’s Next For U.S. Steel Stock After A Mixed Q4?
WST stock has dropped 43% since the start of 2024, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 index, which has gained 28% over the same period. Weakness in its generics and biologics segments has weighed on its share price recently. If you’re looking for a less volatile investment option, consider the High-Quality Portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500, delivering over 91% returns since its inception.
West Pharmaceutical Services’ revenue for Q4 reached $749 million, reflecting a 2.3% year-over-year increase. The company’s proprietary products sales grew by 3.4%, while contract-manufactured products sales declined by 2.5%. The drop in CMP sales was attributed to reduced demand for healthcare diagnostic devices, whereas PPS sales benefited from increased adoption of self-injection device platforms.
Additionally, the company experienced a 150 basis point reduction in its gross profit margin to 36.5%, alongside a slight 10 basis point drop in its operating margin to 21.7%. This impacted earnings, which came in at $1.82 per share compared to $1.83 in the prior-year quarter. Looking ahead, West Pharmaceutical projects sales of $2.89 billion and adjusted earnings of $6.10 per share for 2025, falling short of market expectations of $3.04 billion and $7.44, respectively.
Following the earnings announcement, WST stock plummeted 38% due to its disappointing guidance. Over a broader timeframe, its stock performance has been volatile, with annual returns of 66% in 2021, -50% in 2022, 50% in 2023, and -7% in 2024.
By comparison, the Trefis High-Quality Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has exhibited significantly lower volatility while consistently outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why is that? HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered better returns with reduced risk compared to the broader market, as demonstrated by the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
Given the prevailing macroeconomic uncertainty, including potential interest rate cuts and ongoing trade tensions, will WST stock repeat its struggles from 2022 and 2024, or will it stage a recovery over the next year? After its recent decline, we believe WST stock is currently undervalued. Why?
At its present level of around $200, WST stock is trading at just 5.1x trailing revenue, compared to its five-year average price-to-sales ratio of 9.2x. While lower profit margins and cautious guidance justify some valuation compression, we believe the stock is oversold at current levels, presenting a compelling investment opportunity. Separately, after a rally, should you Buy, Sell, Or Hold HIMS Stock At $60?
While WST stock appears undervalued, it's useful to analyze how West Pharmaceutical Services' Peers compare on key metrics. You can explore further industry-wide comparisons at Peer Comparisons.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has a new and rather familiar name for his vision for the country: ""MIGA.""

        In a press briefing with President Donald Trump on Thursday, Modi tweaked his US counterpart's famed slogan, saying he wanted to ""Make India Great Again.""
    

        ""When America and India work together, that is, when it's MAGA plus MIGA, it becomes MEGA. A MEGA partnership for prosperity,"" he said, adding that India and the US had agreed to work toward doubling bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030.
    

        Modi's visit came as Trump outlined his plans to impose ""reciprocal"" tariffs on trading partners, including India.
    

        As of 2024, the US is one of India's largest trade partners. US goods trade with India stood at an estimated $129.2 billion in 2024, per the Office of the United States Trade Representative.
    

        But Trump took aim at what he called India's ""very strong"" tariffs that ""limit US access"" to the local market.
    

        ""We are, right now, a reciprocal nation,"" Trump said. ""Whatever India charges, we're charging them.""
    

        He said that going forward he and Modi wanted a ""level playing field"" regarding tariffs and that they had agreed to a deal for India to import more American oil and gas.
    

        Trump added that the US would also be increasing military sales to India and was ""paving the way"" to provide the country with F-35 fighter jets.
    

        India's benchmark indices dropped on Friday as investors' concerns over tariffs mounted.
    

        Under Modi's leadership, India has emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic as one of the world's fastest-growing economies, spurred partly by a large, youthful workforce, significant public infrastructure investment, and a growing IT and services sector.
    

        The Indian economy grew at a rapid rate of 8.2% in the financial year 2023 to 2024, boosted by investment in infrastructure and a rise in household investments in real estate, per the World Bank.
    

        The World Bank projects India will remain among the world's fastest-growing major economies for the next two financial years, with a predicted growth rate of 6.7%.
    

        Modi's government aims to make India a developed nation by 2047, but it faces a number of significant challenges, including high youth unemployment rates, widening economic inequality, regional disparities, a stagnant manufacturing sector, a large informal economy, and challenges in the agriculture sector.

31,2025-02-14,"Novo Nordisk (NVO-0.93%) stock took a hit this week, after a Super Bowl ad highlighted a growing challenge to the company’s dominance over the weight-loss industry.
The Danish pharma giant, known for its blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss medications Ozempic and Wegovy, is on track to have its worst week on Wall Street this year. Novo Nordisk shares have tumbled more than 9%, following an ad during the Super Bowl from the millennial-focused telehealth company Hims & Hers (HIMS+3.24%), which promoted its off-brand Ozempic.
The controversial ad took a surprisingly political tone — with Donald Glover’s “This Is America” as its soundtrack — criticizing the high price tag of branded weight-loss drugs.
“Welcome to weight loss in America — a $160 billion industry that feeds on our failure,” said a narrator in the commercial. “There are medications that work — but they are priced for profits, not patients.”
The ad briefly featured the company’s GLP-1 injections. The weekly treatment contains compounded semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy. In May, Hims & Hers started offering compounded semaglutide injections for just $199 a month — hundreds of dollars cheaper than Ozempic’s nearly $1,000 list price and Wegovy’s $1,349 price tag.
GLP-1 drugs are a class of medications that mimic gut hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite. However, due to their high retail price, U.S. patent protections, and skyrocketing demand, many patients have had difficulty getting their hands on these popular medications.
When a medication is in shortage, which Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy has been for years, the FDA allows pharmacies to make compounded or altered versions of the drug if they meet specific regulatory requirements. This loophole has led several digital health companies, online pharmacies, and wellness spas to produce and sell cheaper versions of brand-name weight-loss drugs. 
Novo Nordisk’s executive vice president of U.S. operations, David Moore, told investors on a call last week that the compounded market is having an impact on the company’s demand, and that impact is “growing faster” than anticipated.
Novo Nordisk reported, this month, that full-year sales of all its drugs grew 26% to $40.5 billion. However, the company projects that sales growth in 2025 will slow down to between 16% and 24%.
Both Novo Nordisk, and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY-2.65%), have been ramping up production of their GLP-1 medications to remove them from the FDA’s drug shortage list, a goal Eli Lilly achieved late last year. The pharmaceutical giants have also filed petitions with the FDA to have their medications added to a list of drugs deemed too complex to compound safely. Novo Nordisk even took out a newspaper ad this week warning of the risks of taking copycat drugs.
This isn’t Novo Nordisk’s only recent setback. In December, the company’s experimental diabetes and weight-loss drug, CagriSema — touted as a potential successor to Ozempic — fell short of expectations. The drug failed to hit the projected 25% average weight loss anticipated by analysts and the company, with patients in a phase 3 trial shedding an average of 22.7% of their body weight after 68 weeks. The disappointment sent Novo’s stock plunging 20% in a single day.
The company’s shares are now down more than 34% over the past year, and it has lost its crown as Europe’s most valuable company to luxury conglamorate LVMH (MC+0.51%).
Meanwhile, Hims & Hers  has seen its stock skyrocket nearly 500% in the past year.

32,2025-02-14,"I used the best Android phones of 2025, and I'm sharing my findings. 

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

It's a particularly interesting year in the mobile industry, with Qualcomm and MediaTek making sizeable gains with their offerings. Qualcomm switched to a fully-custom design after a decade, and the result is that the Snapdragon 8 Elite has generational gains over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and it is magnificent. MediaTek isn't sitting idly by either, and the Dimensity 9400 has notable design wins and much better performance. By contrast, Google's decision to play it safe with the Tensor G4 feels shortsighted, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL doesn't bring any meaningful upgrades in this area.

In Hardwired, AC Senior Editor Harish Jonnalagadda delves into all things hardware, including phones, audio products, storage servers, and networking gear.
I used over a dozen phones powered by the latest chipsets in the last three months, and it's time to take a look at how they differ. Before I get to the benchmarks, a quick overview of what's new this year. Obviously, we need to start with Qualcomm, because the Snapdragon 8 Elite is different to what we've seen in the past. Qualcomm went to a fully custom CPU design in a move that's similar to what Apple does with its own silicon, and it allowed the chip vendor to fine-tune the platform by a considerable amount. It isn't astonishing, then, that the platform has the best single-and multi-core CPU scores of anything I tested, and it even outmatches the iPhone 16 Pro Max — a huge deal in and of itself. The gains with the GPU aren't as noticeable, and while it continues to be one of the best around, it doesn't have an outsized lead. Thankfully, MediaTek was also able to deliver a platform that's fantastic, and the Dimensity 9400 has enticing upgrades. Although it uses stock Arm cores, MediaTek's decision to exclusively leverage big cores makes a clear difference when it comes to performance. MediaTek has been doing this for two years now, and it nailed the fundamentals.

Interestingly, the GPU on the Dimensity 9400 is able to hold its own against what Qualcomm is offering. That just hasn't been the case in previous years, and I even managed to get better scores with the Immortalis-G925 than the Adreno 830. Qualcomm still leads the way with sustained performance, but it's great to see MediaTek gaining ground in this key area. There isn't much to talk about the Tensor G4, as Google is using the same core configuration and manufacturing node as the G3. While Qualcomm and MediaTek made the switch to a 3nm node — delivering big gains in efficiency — Google is still using the 4nm node, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL doesn't quite have the same battery longevity. I'm using ASUS's Zenfone 12 Ultra as the Qualcomm baseline as it has a good thermal solution while still technically being a mainstream phone. I went with the Vivo X200 Pro to highlight the Dimensity 9400; while the Find X8 Pro also uses the same platform, I felt that the X200 Pro did a better job at gaming, so that's the one I'm using. And with Google, the Pixel 9 Pro XL has the best thermal management system in the Pixel 9 series, so that's the one I used.

When it comes to the CPU, it's clear that Qualcomm has a definite edge this year. The custom design allowed devices like the Zenfone 12 Ultra and Honor Magic 7 Pro to net the best scores in Geekbench 6's single- and multi-core workloads, and I don't see this changing over the course of 2025. The Dimensity 9400 does a great job as well, and while it is faster than last year, it doesn't outshine Qualcomm. As you can imagine, the Pixel 9 Pro XL lags behind its rivals, posting scores that just don't measure up — the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3-based OnePlus 13R does a better job. Annoyingly, it's a similar story with the GPU as well, and the device just doesn't come close to 2025 flagships. That said, I didn't see any slowdowns in regular use, and if anything, Google did a great job with optimization with the Android 15 update, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL has much better fluidity than previous years. The biggest issue is that the 9 Pro XL just doesn't deliver the same level of performance in demanding games. You don't get stable framerates, it throttles too soon, and it doesn't even measure up to Qualcomm and MediaTek's 2024 offerings, much less their latest platforms. Google says it positioned on-device AI as the differentiator with the Tensor G4, but even in this area, it doesn't do anywhere as well as Qualcomm. It has a slender lead over the Dimensity 9400 in Geekbench's AI workloads, but the Zenfone 12 Ultra once again has the distinct edge, with Qualcomm's NPU clearly the one to beat.

When it comes to gaming, the Immortalis-G925 in the Dimensity 9400 delivered the best scores in 3DMark's Wild Life Extreme and Solar Bay tests. That said, the platform tends to throttle aggressively, and the X200 Pro had a stability score of just 49% in the demanding Steel Nomad Light endurance run. By contrast, Qualcomm-powered devices managed a score of at least 70%, with most devices going up to 90% in the same test. The downside to limited throttling is that Qualcomm-based devices tend to run hotter. The X200 Pro went up to a maximum of 44 degrees Celsius after an extended gaming session, but the Zenfone 12 Ultra hit 46 degrees, and Nubia's Z70 Ultra got up to 59 degrees — the highest of any phone I tested. Synthetic tests don't reveal the whole story, but having used these devices for an extended amount of time, what's clear is that both Qualcomm and MediaTek have done a fabulous job this year. I'm glad that MediaTek is able to deliver a product that goes up against Qualcomm in the high-end category — that just hasn't been the case in previous years.

Another interesting point is the ISP; while Qualcomm continues to make gains in this area, MediaTek outdid itself this year, with the X200 Pro and Find X8 Pro delivering the best camera packages of 2025. Of course, the camera hardware and tuning makes a sizeable difference, but the ISP on the Dimensity 9400 is an integral part of the package, and MediaTek did all the right things. It's a similar situation with battery life. The key talking point is the introduction of silicon-carbon battery tech, and Dimensity 9400-powered devices have a clear edge when it comes to battery life. While the OnePlus 13 and Vivo X200 Pro have identical 6000mAh cells, the X200 Pro managed to last longer in my testing, delivering an additional hour of screen-on-time. I didn't do any quantitative battery testing, but my usage across devices is roughly unchanged, and the two phones that delivered the best battery life are the X200 Pro and Find X8 Pro, both powered by the Dimensity 9400. Ultimately, both Qualcomm and MediaTek did a standout job with their 2025 designs, and while MediaTek is seeing better design wins, Qualcomm continues to dominate the North American market. I don't see that status quo changing anytime soon, but what's refreshing is that MediaTek has a viable alternative in the Dimensity 9400 in other global markets.

Coinbase (COIN) finished 2024 with very strong business momentum as sentiment about the wider digital asset industry improved, broker JMP said in a research report on Thursday after the crypto exchange's fourth quarter results.
JMP raised its Coinbase price target to $475 from $400 and reiterated its market outperform rating. The shares dropped 1.3% to $294.30 in early trading, after rising 8.4% on Thursday.
Wall Street may be underestimating the company's prospects, JMP said. 
""You ain't seen nothing yet,"" analysts led by Devin Ryan wrote, and if the ""transaction pace continues, 1Q25 revenues would exceed current Street consensus by nearly 30%."" 
There is a ""seismic shift"" happening in the industry, the report said, and the crypto exchange's positive momentum doesn't reflect some of the changes that are still yet to come.
JMP expects huge growth for Coinbase and estimates that the company will be multiples of its current size in the coming five years.
""The regulatory and legislative backdrop is now supportive for the next chapter of crypto,"" the report added.

34,2025-02-14,"While Grand Theft Auto Online is over a decade old at this point, and many players are likely ready to move on to this year’s Grand Theft Auto 6, Take-Two’s CEO suggests the aging online game might continue to get updates so long as enough people are still playing.
In a new interview with IGN, the head of Rockstar Games’ parent company Take-Two, Strauss Zelnick, was asked why players should continue to invest time and money into GTA Online when the next big game in the series is possibly just eight months away from launching. Of course Zelnick couldn’t talk specifically about GTA 6's online multiplayer—which has yet to be revealed by Rockstar—but he did cite an old NBA game as example of how Take-Two has a track record of supporting games that people are still playing. 
“I’m going to speak theoretically only because I’m not going to talk about a particular project when an announcement hasn’t been made. But generally speaking, we support our properties when the consumers are involved with those titles,” said Zelnick. 
As an example, we launched NBA 2K Online in China, I think originally in 2012 if I’m not mistaken. And then we launched NBA 2K Online 2 in China in 2017. If I’m not mistaken. We did not sunset Online. They both are still in the market and they serve consumers and they’re alive and we have this massive audience.
Zelnick continued, “So we’ve shown a willingness to support legacy titles when a community wants to be engaged with them.”
While the Take-Two boss didn’t outright say “GTA Online will keep getting updates after GTA 6 launches,” it’s pretty clear what he’s suggesting here. If GTA Online has a large enough audience still playing, the game will likely get more updates. I do wonder how Rockstar North—the main studio behind GTA—would balance that with supporting GTA 6 and any online modes it might include. Would Rockstar tap other parts of the company to support GTA Online, or maybe even an outside studio to take over maintaining and updating the aging crime MMO? GTA Online still makes a lot of money, and Take-Two ain’t going to walk away from hundreds of millions of dollars. 
As for GTA 6, earlier this month Zelnick seemed very confident that the next title in the series will launch in fall 2025, telling IGN: “Look, there’s always a risk of slippage and I think as soon as you say words like ‘absolutely,’ you jinx things. So we feel really good about it.”

Both contain the active ingredient semaglutide, on January 13, 2025, in Sydney, Australia (Photo by Steve Christo - Corbis/Corbis via Getty Images)
The stock price of Hims & Hers Health (NYSE: HIMS), a telehealth platform, has surged an impressive 43% over the past week. A major driver of this growth was the company’s widely discussed Super Bowl commercial, which aired on Sunday. The ad highlighted the obesity crisis in the U.S., arguing that the healthcare system’s high costs and industry practices prevent access to essential weight-loss medications. [1]

Hims & Hers offers a compounded version of semaglutide, the active ingredient in obesity treatments developed by Novo Nordisk. The stock has experienced extraordinary growth, rising nearly nine-fold from approximately $7 in early 2022 to around $60 today. This dramatic increase can be attributed to:
Despite the impressive run of HIMS stock, investors seeking a steadier approach may want to explore the High-Quality Portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500, delivering returns of over 91% since inception.
Hims & Hers operates an online platform that connects patients with licensed healthcare professionals, offering treatments for various conditions, including hair loss and sexual wellness. Hims & Hers revenue is primarily driven by retail sales, which account for 97% of total revenue. The company's revenue growth has been fueled by increased demand for GLP-1 weight-loss medications.
With certain weight-loss drugs like Zepbound recently facing shortages, Hims & Hers benefited from selling compounded alternatives. While Wegovy and Zepbound are priced above $1,000 for a four-week supply, Hims & Hers' compounded version is available for $165. However, these compounded medications are not FDA-approved. While the FDA reports that Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro and Zepbound are no longer in short supply, Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and Wegovy remain scarce, allowing compounded alternatives to persist in the market.
Hims & Hers has expanded its user base significantly, with total subscribers increasing from 0.5 million in 2021 to over 2 million today. Additionally, the average revenue per subscriber has climbed from $51 to $60 during the same period.
On the profitability front, the company reduced its operating loss from $115 million in 2021 to $29 million in 2023. Over the last twelve months, Hims & Hers has turned profitable, reporting an operating income of $43 million, with operating margins improving from -42.3% in 2021 to 3.5% today. The company is set to release its full-year results later this month.
Although HIMS shares have delivered strong returns, significantly outperforming the broader market, the stock has experienced substantial price fluctuations. Annual returns for HIMS were -55% in 2021, -2% in 2022, 39% in 2023, and an impressive 172% in 2024. In comparison, the High-Quality Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has been much less volatile and has consistently outperformed the S&P 500. Why? The portfolio is designed to provide strong returns while minimizing risk, as reflected in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
The current surge in HIMS stock appears to be fueled by optimism surrounding continued compounding opportunities. However, as weight-loss medications become more readily available through traditional channels, the company’s addressable market may shrink. Given these uncertainties, long-term investment in HIMS stock carries risks. Notably, the average analyst price target of $26 represents a significant 55% discount from the current price of $60. As an aside, why is the stock up 30% this year? See What’s Happening With Roku Stock?

Note: Cisco’s fiscal year 2024 ended on July 27, 2024.
Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ: CSCO), a company specializing in networking equipment, security, collaboration, and cloud management services, has seen its stock rise 6% year-to-date, compared to the S&P 500 index’s 3% growth as of January 12. In contrast, CSCO’s competitor, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG), experienced a 3% decline in the same period. Separately, check out: HubSpot Stock At $840 – Is the Price Justified?
Cisco’s Q2 earnings for the period ending January 25, released on February 12, surpassed analyst expectations on both revenue and profit. The company reported $14 billion in revenue, marking a 9% year-over-year (y-o-y) increase. This performance ended a four-quarter streak of revenue declines, with growth largely driven by a surge in AI infrastructure orders, which amounted to over $350 million during the quarter. Despite this revenue boost, net income fell 8% y-o-y to $2.43 billion, or $0.61 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, EPS increased by 8% to $0.94.
Looking ahead, Cisco raised its full-year revenue outlook to a range of $56 billion to $56.5 billion, up from its previous estimate of $55.3 billion to $56.3 billion. The company also increased its adjusted earnings per share forecast to between $3.68 and $3.74, compared to its earlier projection of $3.60 to $3.66. If you are looking for a portfolio with steady gains rather than investing in an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, generating > 91% returns since its inception.
Cisco’s fiscal first half saw mixed results, with security revenue doubling y-o-y, while networking revenue dropped by 14%. While product revenue remained stable, service revenue grew by 6% y-o-y, underscoring the industry's shift towards service-based solutions. In March 2024, Cisco completed its $27 billion acquisition of Splunk, a move aimed at strengthening its security offerings. This acquisition aligns with Cisco's strategy to enhance its AI-powered threat detection and response capabilities. Splunk has already contributed positively to Cisco’s revenue; without it, Cisco’s total revenue would have declined by 1% y-o-y. Additionally, Splunk has boosted Cisco's adjusted EPS ahead of expectations. Its AI-driven software, which helps companies analyze log files and manage cybersecurity risks, will be cross-sold to around 5,000 existing Cisco customers identified as potential users.
Cisco has also improved its gross margins in recent quarters, benefiting from lower freight and component costs, a more favorable product mix, and overall cost efficiencies. On a GAAP basis, Cisco’s total gross margin, product gross margin, and services gross margin stood at 65.1%, 63.7%, and 68.9%, respectively, compared to 64.2%, 62.7%, and 68.2% in Q2 of fiscal 2024. Similar trends may continue in Q3. The company has also been shifting towards a recurring revenue model through software subscriptions and service contracts, which could further support margins.
CSCO stock has experienced volatile returns over the past four years, with performance varying significantly from year to year.

38,2025-02-14,"Hi, I’m Adrian — a computer science PhD who decided that successfully selling an AI company wasn’t enough of a midlife crisis. So naturally, I’m now a quant trader attempting to turn Python code and probability theory into market-beating returns.
(My therapist calls it “an exercise in productive self-sabotage”)
Instead of following conventional wisdom and buying index funds, I’m attempting to beat the market with algorithms and $25,000 of my own money. Every trade, balance sheet, and questionable decision — documented in real-time with complete transparency.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Janelle Romero, a 30-year-old labor and employment law attorney in New York City. It's been edited for length and clarity.

        As an employment attorney, I advise people to leave their jobs to make more money. Job-hopping also helped me triple my own salary from five figures to six figures in three years.
    

        Job-hopping is the best way to increase your salary no matter the industry, but you must ensure that the skills and experience you gain in each role contribute to the big picture of the professional you want to be.
    

        After job-hopping for the second half of my 20s, I earn more than $200,000 in my current role.
    

        My father strongly opposed job-hopping and felt it might hurt my career trajectory. I also received negative feedback from many recruiters about the number of jobs I'd held in such a short period, but I had a strategy.
    

        When I graduated from law school at the end of 2018, I intentionally job-hopped to advance my career.
    

        I took my first job out of law school in 2019 at age 24 and worked there for a little over one year. I was hired as a law clerk making $40,000 a year, with a guarantee that I'd be given a raise once I was admitted to the Bar.
    

        I realized it would not be easy to make real money if I were only given raises in $5,000 increments.
    

        By the one-year mark, I was already knowledgeable in wage theft cases because my firm involved me heavily in our cases. I noticed our clients often had valid discrimination cases, but we didn't practice discrimination at that firm.
    

        I wasn't yet experienced enough to navigate discrimination cases independently, and I wanted to learn how, so I left for a discrimination firm.
    

        I was also given insurance benefits, a matching 401(k), and payment for attorney, Bar association, and course registration fees.
    

        I stayed at that firm for about six months to gain the experience and knowledge I needed to feel confident navigating the process of filing discrimination claims.The more experience you have in the job, the less time you should take to learn the role in your next job.
    

        I said to my first employer, ""You already practice employment law, but you don't do discrimination, and I do. Let me do discrimination here."" They hired me back, and I started their discrimination department.
    

        They were willing to pay me that much more because I returned with specific experience and knowledge to expand the firm's services.
    

        Trying to market and attract discrimination clients led me to TikTok. I made videos explaining the sexual harassment allegations against Andrew Cuomo on my own TikTok account so I could take it with me when I left.
    

        The videos did fairly well. I took those videos to my boss and showed him I could reach thousands of people in just three videos. I even received a few inquiry emails from potential clients.
    

        He agreed and allowed me to market on the app to bring in clients. As my page grew, the number of cases I could bring to the firm grew, and my value increased. I used this to negotiate my commission deal.
    

        Then, I became curious about how businesses handle HR complaints and got a job as the head of labor law at an international startup. I oversaw their HR department, which had over 700 employees and contractors.
    

        Things moved quickly, and I learned a lot. I helped expand the company to about 27 additional countries in my four months there.
    

        The startup hit some funding roadblocks and had a large round of layoffs, which I was part of in early summer 2022.
    

        I was let go a couple of months before my destination wedding, so in hindsight, the layoff was a blessing in disguise.
    

        Starting my own firm set me back in salary for my first year — I reinvested profits into my work. Toward the end of 2023, I'd built up a steady enough stream of cases to allow me to expand.
    

        I started exploring the possibility of merging my firm with another and returning to the position of a salaried employee.
    

        In March 2024, I accepted a full-time position as managing associate attorney at Consumer Justice Law Firm. I brought all my retained cases to the new firm for an increased commission rate once they were resolved.
    

        In my current role, I make $225,000 in base salary plus commission and bonuses. At 30, I've more than quintupled my salary by job-hopping.
    

        It benefits your career when you job-hop to gain new skills instead of randomly. If I'd job-hopped from a criminal law firm to a personal injury firm to an intellectual property firm, it wouldn't have been effective because that experience wouldn't have compounded on itself.
    

        You don't leave a job just because you don't like it or you're bored, frustrated, or annoyed. You leave a job once you've hit your salary ceiling at the company and gained the experience that the role is supposed to provide you with.
    

        I think it's great for people to enjoy what they do, but I don't think it's important for your job to be your passion. Your life should be your passion — your job should be the thing you do so that you can afford your passions.

40,2025-02-14,Investors shrugged off inflation reports and new Trump tariffs.
41,2025-02-14,"CLN
Asian equities ended the week mixed, led higher by Hong Kong, especially Hong Kong-listed growth stocks, while Taiwan underperformed.
For the week, Hong Kong was a strong outperformer in the region, led by growth stocks. Meanwhile, Mainland China, South Korea, Australia, Thailand, and Singapore posted small gains, while India, Japan, Indonesia, and the Philippines posted losses. Hong Kong volumes were massive. The most heavily traded stock by value usually sees around HKD 5 billion in turnover. But, today’s top performers were Tencent, which gained +7.42% with a value of volume traded at HKD 34.4 billion, Alibaba, which gained +6.34% with a volume of value traded of HKD 31.7 billion, Xiaomi, which gained +7.32% with a volume of value traded of HKD 15.2 billion, Meituan, which gained +6.39% with a value of volume traded at HKD 12.5 billion, and Semiconductor Manufacturing International (SMIC), which fell -0.98% and had a value of volume traded at HKD 10.5 billion. Remarkably, these values are slightly off from yesterday!
Boosting Hong Kong sentiment before the market open was President Trump’s lack of tariff details, indicating there is time for more “Art of the Deal” and Reuters reporting that President Xi will host “a symposium to boost private sector sentiment that will be attended by leaders” including Alibaba’s Jack Ma, Tencent’s CEO Pony Ma, Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun, Yushu Technology CEO Wang Xing Xing, and DeepSeek found Liang Wenfeng. As Reuters notes, President Xi “rarely” chairs such events, as the last time was in 2018. Jack Ma’s attendance has obvious implications, i.e. that he is out of the doghouse.
Mainland investors understood the invitation’s implication with a massive net buy via Southbound Stock Connect, as now 5% of shares outstanding owned are by Mainland investors. This should double in the next year thanks to Tencent and Meituan’s over 10% Southbound ownership levels.
Today’s rally was very broad with all sectors rising, only two sub-sectors declining, only 38 stocks declining versus 462 advancers.
BYD gained +7.43% after the company reported integrating DeepSeek into its driver assistance system.
Healthcare was the best-performing sector on reports of companies integrating DeepSeek AI into various applications, as Alibaba Health gained +29.1%. It is important to note that the Global Industry Classification System (GICS) places it in the Consumer Staples sector. Ping An Healthcare gained +17.95% and Wuxi Biologics gained +11.75%.
While it was not widely cited as a catalyst, January New Loans Year-to-Date (YTD) came in at RMB 5.1 trillion, versus an expected RMB 4.5 trillion. At the same time, Aggregate Financing YTD came in at RMB 7.1 trillion, versus an expected RMB 6.5 trillion.
Mainland China opened lower but managed to grind higher, led by growth stocks on strong volumes, though mixed breadth (advancers versus decliners). The ETFs favored by China’s “National Team”, i.e. investment firms associated with sovereign wealth, had average volume, though several mega-cap stocks had strong days, indicating there may have been some help and intervention. Domestic investors might be getting more involved as indicated by the high volumes.
chart
The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech indexes gained +3.69% and +5.56%, respectively, on volume that increased +3.91% from yesterday, which is 258% of the 1-year average. 462 stocks advanced while 38 stocks declined. Main Board short turnover increased +2.41% from yesterday, which is 245% of the 1-year average, as 15% of turnover was short turnover (Hong Kong’s short turnover includes ETF short volume, which is driven by market makers’ ETF hedging). The growth factor and small caps gained more than the value factor and large caps. All sectors were positive, led by Health Care, which gained +7.03%, Communication Services, which gained +6.64%, and Consumer Discretionary, which gained +6.08%. The top-performing subsectors were consumer staples distribution, software, and services. Meanwhile, petroleum & petrochemicals and semiconductors were among the worst-performing subsectors. Southbound Stock Connect volumes were 4x pre-stimulus levels as Mainland investors bought a net $990 million worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs, led by Alibaba, which was a very large net buy, Tencent, Meituan, Kuaishou, Alibaba Health, and Xiaomi. SMIC and CNOOC were net sells.
Shanghai, Shenzhen, and the STAR Board gained +0.43%, +0.75%, and +0.53%, respectively, on volume that decreased -5.81% from yesterday, which is 154% of the 1-year average. 2,287 stocks advanced while 2,656 stocks declined. The growth factor and small caps outperformed the value factor and large caps. The top-performing sectors were Communication Services, which gained +4.88%, Health Care, which gained +2.65%, and Consumer Discretionary, which gained +2.06%. Meanwhile, Energy was flat and Real Estate fell -0.52%. The top-performing subsectors were healthcare services, software, and telecom. Meanwhile, soft drinks, leisure products, and retail were among the worst-performing subsectors. Northbound Stock Connect volumes were well above average. CNY and the Asia Dollar Index rose versus the US dollar. Treasury bonds fell. Copper rose while steel fell.

Researchers at Shanghai Jiao Tong University are introducing new methods of biochar production that could significantly improve its ability to sequester carbon, according to TechXplore.
Biochar is biomass that has been superheated in a zero-oxygen environment to create stable, porous carbon. The biomass used can include animal or vegetation waste, which prevents it from emitting methane over normal decomposition. What heat-trapping pollution that is produced during biochar pyrolysis is usually reused in the heating process.
The final product is generally used in agriculture since its porous structure helps soil retain water and provides a medium for a healthy microbiome. Studies have even shown biochar can also filter out microplastics. The material is stable enough that it can keep carbon underground for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. This makes biochar one of the more reliable means of generating carbon credits, earning big attention from the likes of Google.

The newly researched process involves adding polyethyleneimine to the biochar process, which researchers say can dramatically increase its ability to capture carbon dioxide. PEI has been known to capture carbon dioxide in other applications, including in space life support systems. PEI is otherwise used in detergents, adhesives, water treatment agents, and cosmetics.
Agriculture remains a large-scale source of carbon pollution and one that's hard to avoid. If we want to decarbonize our food production systems, we'll need every tool in the box, and biochar fits the bill. Not only can it move more carbon into the ground, but it also shows promise as a cost-effective means of increasing yields thanks to improved soil health. Biochar can also help increase climate resilience in drought-stricken areas by retaining moisture for crops.
Biochar is a well-established technology, dating back to ancient Mesoamerica, so adding PEI to the mix shouldn't be a big leap. That said, there's no indication of how long it would take for this tech to graduate from the lab to the market.

                One of the activities at Moss Appreciation Week is a build-your-own-terrarium workshop.

When it comes to plants, there are some that really command attention, like majestic redwoods or elegant roses. And then…. there's moss, which doesn't usually get a lot of love, or even get noticed at all. 
But in Portland, Oregon, students at Lewis & Clark College have been trying to change that with their annual Moss Appreciation Week: a five-day festival held every February to celebrate and get up-close with the humble green carpet students walk past every day.
The event got its start a few years back, when a Lewis & Clark student spent the summer working at Portland State University's Herbarium and fell in love with mosses, according to Parvaneh Abbaspour, Lewis & Clark's science librarian. Abbaspour helped the student set up an exhibit at the library and has been working with the school's Natural History Club to run Moss Appreciation Week since then. The festival is now in its seventh year.
 ""Moss is something that's underappreciated,"" says Madeline Jones, one of the student organizers of this year's event. ""So we're taking some time to appreciate the moss that makes our campus beautiful.""
Moss Appreciation Week is packed with events both scientific and downright silly. Moss walks, moss talks, moss movies, crafting moss-themed Valentines (it's hard to resist ""I Lichen You A Lot"" puns), which students look forward to every year. Some students dress up as moss. 

                Lewis & Clark student Mira Schwaller donned a moss costume to blend into the campus woods as part of Moss Appreciation Week, 2024.

Others pass out moss-covered cupcakes (covered with crumbles of matcha cake to look like moss). There are moss terrarium building workshops, and a ""gastropod derby,"" where snails and slugs (for whom moss is a nice moist microclimate) ""race"" down PVC chutes toward a yeast-soaked clump of moss at the finish line.
There's also a moss petting zoo – a table with a few dozen moss samples set up in the library, showing the full diversity of mossy forms.

""It kind of makes me think of like, if you had the opportunity to pet a muppet, this is what you would encounter,"" laughs Robin Anderson, the library worker tasked with misting the samples every few hours to keep them moist.
""I don't think there is a moss with a bad texture,"" says student Saph Leeper. "" Like this could be like a rug. And honestly, I would buy a rug like this.""
Watching a bunch of students lavish attention on moss for a whole week begs the question: why?
According to Jenna Ekwealor, a researcher who runs San Francisco State University's moss lab, and spoke at last year's Moss Appreciation Week, it's well deserved. She says moss is a really special plant that more people should know more about. Although Ekwealor argues that mosses, like all organisms, should be appreciated for themselves, she is happy to run through the greatest hits of what makes the plants particularly compelling.
""They're tiny plants, but they're different from most plants we see,"" explains Ekwealor. ""They don't have any roots… so they take in all of their water straight through their leaves.""

                Members of Lewis & Clark's Natural History Club made ""moss cupcakes"" for this years Moss Appreciation Week: each one topped with crumbles of matcha-flavored cake to appear like moss.

Ekwealor says because mosses don't really need soil, and because they can survive long droughts, they grow where a lot of other plants can't. Although people often think of mosses as the plants of rainy places (like the Pacific Northwest), they're actually found everywhere – from the highest mountaintops to the driest valleys. And they play an important role in ecosystems.
""They prevent erosion and runoff,"" says Ekwealor. ""They act like sponges out there and they can purify or clean air and water.""
She also says mosses can change our perspective. For example, their ability to go dormant and regrow makes her think about resilience. And the fact that mosses can reproduce clonally, and form a unit with other lichens and organisms, makes her think philosophically about what it means to be an individual.
Plus, they're ancient. Mosses have been around for 400 million years, according to Ekwealor. And she says a moss-like ancestor helped create the oxygen levels that made human life possible. On top of all that, there's still a lot about them we don't know.
So, with such a fascinating resume… why don't more people care about mosses?
""Part of the reason that they have been sort of neglected or underappreciated over time is simply because they're small,"" theorizes Ekwealor. ""And it takes some work to lean in and look at this tiny thing.""
At Moss Appreciation Week, an entire campus is leaning in to look at the world of moss. ""It's a nice little escape this week,"" laughs organizer Kenji Yamamoto. ""Just to focus on the little things, and slow down to the pace of moss, if you will.""

                Students harvested moss around campus for a build-your-own-terrarium workshop during Moss Appreciation Week in 2023.

Gathering mosses for the terrarium-building workshop, sophomore Deenie Bulyalert acknowledges that the event is, indeed, goofy. But it's also more than that.
"" I think other people can view it as like, 'oh, it's so silly to kneel down and look at plants. They exist every day in our life.' But I think it is so profound, because it's little things that we don't even notice every single day.""
Ekwealor notes that taking stock of the little things doesn't get rid of life's challenges. ""But it does help me put things into balance, and realize that there's still a lot here on this earth, a lot of life, a lot of beauty, that is enduring all of the hardships with us.""
You don't need Moss Appreciation Week to find that beauty – you can step outside any week, almost anywhere, and find it.

51,2025-02-14,"Below book value stocks
Below book value stocks are not thought of by Wall Street analysts as having much to do (if anything) with growth, this era’s most sought after quality. A company that trades for a share price less than current assets minus current liabilities is just not as much fun as a company that mentions “artificial intelligence” at least a dozen times in a quarterly report.
Nevertheless, value stocks continue to be pursued by those few money managers who took notes while studying the Benjamin Graham classics The Intelligent Investor and Security Analysis. Other key metrics are definitely worth considering besides just book value but it’s a good start for those conducting research using the old school valuation methods.
With that in mind, here are four stocks that may qualify as interesting subjects for more thorough analysis.
Air Lease Group (NYSE: AL)
Air Lease daily price chart, 2 14 25.
The stock is have a good day today: it’s back up above the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages. The challenge will be the November high of $52, a likely spot for resistance.
The rental and leasing services company purchases jets and leases them to customers around the world. The stock trades at 71% of book value with a price-earnings ratio of 14.79 (the p/e for the S&P 500 is 38.54.) This year’s earnings are up by 27.49%. Air Lease Group pays a dividend of 1.13%.
FinVolution Group ADR (NYSE: FINV)
FinVolution Group daily price chart, 2 14 25.
The stock hits a new high today and remains well above the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages, both of which continue to uptrend.
Fin Volution Group, a credit services business based in Shanghai, has a market capitalization of $1.16 billion. The stock trades with a price-earnings ratio of 6.88 and at 56% of its book value. The company has no debt, long-term or otherwise. Fin Volution pays a 3.07% dividend.
Heritage Commerce (NASDAQ: HTBK)
Heritage Commerce daily price chart, 2 14 25.

One of the hardest things for corporate management of successful companies to do is admit that things have changed, and they have to pivot and start anew. Companies may have a strong cash cow that has been delivering stellar revenues for years, sometimes even decades, and fail to anticipate potential threats on the horizon. Many of these companies may even have strategic and scenario planning teams that scour developments in their industry and know about the threats. Top management can pay them lip service, but unless this department can get management buy-in from the very top for changes they want to make, they are often viewed as distractions to making money.
We don't have to look too far back in history to find brands that have had the rug pulled out from under them. Take, for instance, Kodak, Nokia, Blockbuster and Sears. Kodak had traditional film, Nokia had analog phones, Blockbuster had DVD and video cassette rentals and Sears had brick-and-mortar retail. Despite their hold on the market, these companies were hit hard by digital photography, digital smartphones, online streaming and online retail.
To avoid a similar struggle, here are four lessons for leaders:
The late Intel Corporation CEO Andrew S. Grove wrote a New York Times bestseller entitled Only the Paranoid Survive: How to Exploit the Crisis Points That Challenge Every Company. In it, Grove talked about how they pivoted Intel from their memory chip business into the microprocessor business, which eventually led to the current cash cow. Unfortunately for Intel, new upstarts and rivals like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stole their thunder in the new field of artificial intelligence.
The advantage of new startups without a legacy cash cow may not be apparent at times. They have no brand. They have no cash. However, they have no legacy to protect or to prevent them from doing sometimes “crazy” things to win the market. At the end of the day, it is not crazy if it works.
While companies might put in a little effort to adapt to the new technology, the responses are often subpar. For example, brick-and-mortar retail stores may have their own online stores, but if the emphasis is still on their traditional stores, the shoppers will feel it while using their website to shop.
Pivoting a company away from its traditional cash cow is not always the answer. Take, for example, how Budweiser and Jaguar tried to steer away from their traditional customer bases to attract and grow new ones. Right now, both brands are still reeling sales-wise from their marketing pivot missteps.
Some try to use nostalgia as a marketing tool. Atari, the 1980s gaming giant, does not have the same types of games as Electronic Arts—nor does it seem to want to. Instead, Atari tries to entice old gamers to play similar low-resolution games. Kodak still pushes film to traditional photographers and filmmakers and, in turn, filmmakers like Quentin Tarantino and Christopher Nolan pride themselves on still using film. If you want to keep your small niche base, you can do so.
While strategic corporate pivots do not always work, there is always a lesson to be learned. Companies today should take stock of hot topics like digital communications, blockchains and AI, as well as changes in other social, economic, political and technological areas that could impact their business. Don't be one of the companies that makes a misstep that leads to the end of market dominance.

	A seven-strong group of industry names has signed on to help steer the Toronto International Film Festival’s content market into being.

Niv Fichman, Vincent Maraval, Jérôme Paillard, Noah Segal, Monique Simard, Roeg Sutherland and Kerry Swanson are the inaugural members of an advisory committee convened by TIFF ahead of the market launch in 2026.

	Speaking to Deadline during the Berlin Film Festival, Anita Lee, Chief Programming Officer, TIFF, said that committee will ultimately comprise about 12 members. Having set its North American and European members, it will now add some more international firepower.

	A noteworthy wrinkle is that execs with TV experience are expected to join the advisory group – with the new market spanning more than just film and covering series as well.

	There has long been an unofficial market at Toronto and the plans for an official market are about positioning TIFF “as a gateway to North America” for international execs, TIFF CEO Cameron Bailey said when it was announced in sunny Cannes last May.

	Here, in snowy Berlin, Lee elaborated. She said the market will be located in a central hub with booths and exhibition space and the TIFF team are looking at venues in Downtown Toronto. It does not yet have official branding, with the moniker for the newbie market likely to be unveiled at Cannes.

	“There’s been a lot of interest, a lot of excitement, and we’ve been given lot of advice,” Lee said when asked about reaction to the news the market was launching. “Setting up this advisory committee is really the result of that. We’re listening to the industry.”

	The committee will provide industry-level smarts as the new market takes shape. It has chunky funding behind it, with C$23M (US16.2M) of investment from the Canadian government spread over three years up until launch.

	TIFF will have its 50th edition this year and is setting the stage for the 2026 market launch. The plan is to grow the number of industry delegates from circa 5,000 to over 12,000 in three-to-five years.

	“What we’ve heard from new companies, new producers, and especially internationally, is that for them, TIFF having an official market means that larger delegations can attend, that they can receive support from their national bodies,” Lee said.

	










	She added: “What I’ve also really heard from new companies, producers, sales, agents, etc, is that when there is an official market it creates accessibility. It creates an infrastructure for them to come in and be able to navigate the marketplace.”

Here’s the full list of advisory board members and their roles.

Niv Fichman (Canada): Founder, Rhombus Media 

Vincent Maraval (France): CEO, Goodfellas

Jérôme Paillard (France): Film Industry Consultant

Noah Segal (Canada): Co-President & Co-Founder, Elevation Pictures

Today, in the Calculated Risk Real Estate Newsletter: 3rd Look at Local Housing Markets in January
A brief excerpt: The NAR is scheduled to release January Existing Home sales on Friday, February 21st at 10:00 AM. The consensus is for 4.10 million SAAR, down from 4.24 million in December. Last year, the NAR reported sales in January 2024 at 4.00 million SAAR.

NOTE: The tables for active listings, new listings and closed sales all include a comparison to January 2019 for each local market (some 2019 data is not available).

This is the third look at local markets in January. I’m tracking over 40 local housing markets in the US. Some of the 40 markets are states, and some are metropolitan areas. I’ll update these tables throughout the month as additional data is released.

Here is a look at months-of-supply using NSA sales. Since this is NSA data, it is likely this will be near the seasonal low for months-of-supply.

58,2025-02-14,"2024 Returns and Volatility
Bitcoin fared quite well in 2024 against traditional assets like bonds, gold, real estate, and the equity market as a whole. But how does it compare to individual stocks? This matters for stock pickers, and for framing Bitcoin in terms of other major technological movements in the economy.
Bitcoin had an annual 2024 return of 114%. The return and volatility are both much higher than the asset classes of bonds, real estate, gold, and the entire equity market. However, the risk-adjusted winner of 2024 was Palantir (PLTR), which captured a return of 353% and a slightly higher volatility than BTC. MicroStrategy (MSTR) came in close second, finishing out at a return of 338%, but at a much higher volatility. MicroStrategy would have handily beaten PLTR in November when its return YTD was 497%, but MSTR shed much value in the last six weeks of the year from aggressive bitcoin buying, powered by equity dilution.
Even Nvidia (NVDA) offered a higher risk and return, with an annual return in 2024 of 187%. The major tech companies (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta) all offered lower risk and lower returns to Bitcoin. You can see that Bitcoin generally sits on the capital market line of risk and return, with MicroStrategy on one end and government bonds (GOVT) on the other. PLTR is an outlier, but so are companies like Tesla, Coinbase, and Marathon, which all offered lower returns and greater risk. Even the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) roughly matched Bitcoin’s return, but it was more volatile.
Now, let’s take a look at a broader universe of equities. Let's sample the companies in the S&P 500 above a $10 billion market cap. A random sample of these companies on the risk and return chart looks like:
2024 Returns and Volatility
Again, notice the pattern. Some companies have higher returns than Bitcoin in 2024, but also higher risk, like Nvidia and Palantir. Other companies have less return and less risk, like Disney and Nike. Some are strictly worse, with greater risk but lower return, like Tesla and Micron Technology.
There was one company in the S&P 500 that offered a better deal than Bitcoin, with lower risk and greater return. To find it, here's a sample of the companies from the S&P 500 without the $10 billion minimal market capitalization threshold:
2024 Returns and Volatility
Here you can see that Sea Limited had an annual return of almost 200%, and a volatility just shy of Bitcoin’s. Have you heard of Sea Limited? Neither have I. So, indeed there may be a better investment than Bitcoin in any one year. But the chances of finding this one company among 500 is small. This proves my point that Bitcoin really is an asset class, not just another single investment. And its risk and return should be compared to other asset classes, not just to other single stocks.

60,2025-02-14,"There are the graphics cards that grab headlines; then there are the graphics cards more people can actually afford. All eyes are on the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 and RTX 5070 Ti, but after a massive wave of stock issues, Nvidia is pushing the cheaper GPU to March. That gives AMD time to showcase what it has to offer with the upcoming mid-range Radeon RX 9000 series. The jury is still out on whether Team Red can offer a card toÂ compete against Nvidia’s much-touted multi-frame gen.
The $750 Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti is still set to release on Feb. 20, but the companyâs product page now says the $550 RTX 5070 is coming on March 5 (seen via The Verge). On Thursday, AMD shared that it will unveil the anticipated Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT on Feb. 28 at 8 a.m. ET. The cards should be out âin early March.â Sure, everyone loves an underdog story (even if the underdog is one of the biggest chipmakers in the world). Still, the real question is whether DLSS 4 graphics software will hold the edge over the pure promise of AMDâs mid-range hardware, even if it’s cheaper.
Nvidiaâs âTiâ (AKA âTitaniumâ) cards include 16 GB of VRAM compared to 12 on the base 5070. It also has a higher memory bandwidth of 956 Gbps and a supposed 30% better AI processing performance. Team Green has promised the base RTX 5070 can hit RTX 4090 levels of performance, though thatâs only with the help of DLSS 4 and multi-frame gen. We will be testing it for ourselves, but Nvidiaâs claims will rest on how many base frames its cards can produce and how many games it can muster to support DLSS 4.
We still donât know how much AMDâs RDNA 4-based RX 9000 series will cost. However, we may have a pretty good idea about performance. Leaked benchmarks screenshotted by a noted Twitter leaker HKEPC (via WCCFTech) show the 9070 XT includes 16 GB of GDDR6 VRAM, 4096 cores, and a boost clock of 3.1 GHz. The benchmark is more important, with claims it can get more than 200 FPS on the upcoming Monster Hunter Wilds. That benchmark was in a system with an Intel Core Ultra 9 285K and 48 GB of RAM.
Monster Hunter Wildâs recommended system requirements ask for at least an Nvidia RTX 4060 or an AMD RX 6700XT, but thatâs to get 60 FPS at 1080p. Itâs also important to note that official DLSS 4 on Wilds wonât be available at launch, according to PCGamer. It may mean the game could be a good proving ground for the latest Nvidia and AMD GPUs, if only for the sake of running each card on an even playing field.
If AMDâs RX 9070 can beat Nvidia in supply and price, it could have the strongest GPU showing to date. Consumers have proved theyâre hungry for PC upgrades. However, the hype hinges on the promise of playing intensive games at FPS well above 100 without sacrificing ray tracing or other graphical flourishes. Nvidiaâs statements on the 5070âs power have hinged on multi-frame gen. Thatâs not a bad thing, either.Â Iâve used multi-frame gen in several games and found it was more cost-effective in anÂ RTX 5080 than the 5090.Â You really donât need more than 300 FPS in Cyberpunk 2077, especially when you may not easily find a high-quality monitor that does above 240 Hz refresh rates.
Thatâs why the RTX 5070 and 5070 Ti are so important for the sake of Nvidiaâs claims. These are cards youâll find in far more PCs than the 5090. Still, the Radeon RX 9000 series may be far more economical for those looking to upgrade. However, all we know for now is that the RX 9070 XT wonât cost $900, according to AMDâs chief of gaming marketing, Frank Azor.
Nvidiaâs new RTX 5070 launch date is not too surprising. It gives Nvidia more time to potentially sort out any stock issues that have hampered the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 launch. Scalpers have helped decimate stocks online, driving at least one AIM to sell directly to customers through a raffle-based system.
Even when scalpers arenât driving up prices, the RTX 5080 and 5090 are expensive GPUs. The 5080 starts at $1,000, while the 5090 asks for an astronomical $2,000. OEMs have also raised the prices of their own cards beyond the typical markup as well. Already, Micro Center shows preorders for Gigabyte, MSI, Asus, and other RTX 5070 Ti cards are asking for $900, or over $1,000 for an overclocked version like the MSI Vanguard launch edition. Even if the RTX 5070 Ti can do RTX 4090 performance, customers shouldnât need to pay RTX 4090 prices for it.

63,2025-02-14,"Palo Alto Networks reported fiscal Q2 earnings that topped estimates while a key metric, annual recurring revenue, also came in above views."
64,2025-02-14,"Robyn Denholm, who’s led the board since 2018, sold $168 million in the past year exercising stock options in the company, including sales worth $43 million last week. 
Tesla Board Chair Robyn Denholm speaks to the National Press Club of Australia in Canberra in Sept. 2022.
Tesla Board Chair Robyn Denholm has done extremely well for herself in the past year — largely by selling off most of her shares in the electric car company. She unloaded over 65% of her shares and options in the past 12 months, yielding $168 million before taxes–benefitting from the stock’s spike following President Donald Trump’s election victory in November.
Denholm, who’s led the Tesla board since the Securities and Exchange Commission forced CEO Elon Musk out of that role in 2018 following his false tweets about securing funding to take the company private, retained just 85,000 shares and 412,000 options in the company following her most recent share sale this month, for $43 million, according to SEC filings. That’s down from 15,000 shares and 1.47 million options a year ago. A likely reason for the heavy selling: her options are due to expire in June. So she’ll likely remain a heavy seller of her remaining options in the next few months. Since 2017, she’s sold $448 million of Tesla stock, before taxes.
“Board directors get paid in stock and it's really scary to have your entire net worth in one company's assets. So it's perfectly understandable that executives and directors would sell some stock when they can,” said UCLA professor Andrew Verstein, co-director of its Lowell Milken Institute for Business Law and Policy. “On the other hand, it’s a little bit scary because they know how the company is going to do, and if they're selling that could be a bad sign.”
For the latest news in cleantech and sustainability news, sign up here for our Current Climate newsletter.
Most of Denholm’s sales occurred under a plan set in July 2024–she’s exercised and sold over 403,000 options since then–so while the overall reduction in her holdings is dramatic, it isn’t entirely surprising. She, Musk and the six other board members are also on the hook to reimburse the company for as much as $919 million under a settlement approved by the Delaware Court of Chancery last month that found they excessively compensated themselves between 2017 and 2020. The board as a group is returning $277 million in cash, over $450 million of stock options and foregoing options for 2021 through 2023.
Denholm’s individual portion isn’t detailed in the settlement agreement. Given Musk’s 12% stake in Tesla, he’s likely to owe most of the reimbursement.
Denholm didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on her stock sales. Tesla was down slightly, closing at $355.84 on Friday. It’s dropped 25% since peaking at an all-time of $479.86 on Dec. 17.
lon Musk, with his son X Æ A-Xii, speaks with President Donald Trump and reporters in the Oval Office at the White House this week.
With a current $1.1 trillion market valuation Tesla is by far the world’s most valuable automaker, and a highly volatile stock since its 2010 IPO. Musk’s close ties to Donald Trump, enhanced by over $200 million the South African-born billionaire contributed to aid his 2024 presidential run, have been wildly beneficial for Tesla so far. The stock began spiking in November following Trump’s defeat of former Vice President Kamala Harris, peaking at an all-time high of $479.86 on Dec. 17, with investors assuming the new administration would be highly favorable to Musk’s companies, which had faced investigations and regulatory scrutiny under the Biden Administration. An early bonus for Tesla appeared to be a $400 million State Department contract to buy armored electric vehicles, initially identified as Teslas, though that deal is suspended for now.
Denholm, an Australian native who joined Tesla’s board in 2014, is also a partner with Blackbird Ventures, which operates in Australia and New Zealand, and was previously CFO of Australian telecom company Telstra Corp. She is not the only Tesla board member to sell off a big chunk of stock in the past year.
Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, who formerly served as chief of human resources at Walgreens Boots Alliance and joined Tesla’s board in December 2018, has sold $106.5 million of stock and options in the past year, offloading most of her shares in the company. She still had options for 120,948 shares as of last month, down from 765,855 a year ago.
Tesla board members, including Musk’s brother Kimbal, who holds 1.46 million shares, and James Murdoch, have been big financial winners as the stock’s value has surged, especially since the company became highly profitable in 2020 when its Shanghai Gigafactory opened. However, that adds to concerns that they’ve failed in recent years to moderate CEO Musk’s increasingly polarizing comments and actions that threaten the Tesla brand. That’s become an even bigger issue now that he’s leading DOGE, the so-called Department of Governmental Efficiency, for President Donald Trump, and attempting to make major federal budget cuts despite concerns about the legality of that effort.
“It is a company that is succeeding by all metrics, even though all of its inputs are shoddy by conventional standards of good corporate governance or what the Delaware chancellors want to see,” Vernstein said. “Tesla seems to be following the thesis that we can do just fine without those procedures and we don't care if it looks bad.”
“Can you run a company that is quite ambitious and does not check any of the good practices boxes if your idea is good enough, if your CEO is charismatic enough, if your engineering is good enough?” he said. “Can you ignore all of the other niceties, and rally investors and customers? And if that pisses off a few judges and a few law professors, so be it.”

67,2025-02-14,What's the top S&P 500 sector this year? Communications Services. And it's largely due to three runaway winners.
68,2025-02-14,"Business Insider Edition 
Elon Musk's X has successfully courted a new set of advertisers in recent months, and some big-name brands, such as Apple, are returning.

        Does that mean it's seeing an advertising rebound? Well, it's complicated.
    

        A Business Insider analysis of four independent data sources suggests X's pool of advertisers is growing, but it's far from recouping the revenue lost in the ad exodus following Musk's 2022 takeover.
    

        X didn't respond to a request for comment. It's a private company and doesn't publicly report ad revenue data.
    

        According to the market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, 46 of the 100 top-spending US advertisers on X in January weren't spending on the platform in 2022, suggesting it has cultivated a new base of advertisers. (Sensor Tower says its estimates are based on proprietary panel data and data science models and should be used for directional trend analysis.)
    

        President Donald Trump's election victory and Musk's political ascension may have drawn new advertisers to X. It's notable, however, that a large chunk of the top 100 were spending on the platform throughout 2024 — even before the election. The Chinese e-commerce giant Temu was the top advertiser last year, accounting for 3% of total US spend on the platform, Sensor Tower estimated. Temu didn't respond to a request for comment.
    

        Here were the top 10 spenders in January, per Sensor Tower:
    

        Sensor Tower estimated that these advertisers spent less on X overall in January 2025 compared with the previous set of top advertisers in January 2024.
    

        Data from the research firm MediaRadar, which analyzed a panel of more than 2 million US users, showed a similar trend. It estimated that X's US advertising revenue was $1.4 billion in 2024, down 28% from the nearly $2 billion spent on the platform in 2023.
    

        While revenues declined, the number of companies advertising on X in 2024 increased 15% year over year, MediaRadar found.
    

        This increase could stem from a string of new deals X signed with adtech vendors to drive advertiser demand. Ads sold this way tend to go for lower prices than ads sold directly by sales teams, and X would need to share some of this revenue with these vendors. X this month signed a deal with the adtech company Magnite, as BI first reported. X has also done deals with Google and PubMatic.
    

        Musk earlier this month reposted a screenshot of a Wall Street Journal article saying that X's 2024 revenue was down versus 2021, the last full year before it went private, but that it had improved profitability in that time on an adjusted-EBITDA basis. Musk didn't confirm the numbers but posted: ""It's almost like I'm good with money ."" An overall X revenue figure would also include income from its data licensing and subscription businesses, in addition to advertising.
    

        Many advertisers have been cautious about spending on X after Musk's takeover of Twitter in 2022.
    

        The company laid off a large number of its staffers, loosened moderation and account verification rules, and brought back some banned accounts of controversial figures. Musk famously told advertisers that had stopped spending on the platform to ""go fuck yourself."" X is also suing 11 advertisers, alleging they collectively conspired to boycott the platform in contravention of antitrust laws.
    

        Despite these concerns, some industry insiders who spoke with BI posited X could benefit from Trump's November election win and Musk's increasingly influential role in his administration. They said some advertisers were contemplating whether spending on X might make sense this year.
    

        ""We see more advertising money hedging against political risk,"" said a top media buyer who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive client spending decisions. Their identity is known to BI.
    

        ""Normally, the CEO does not get involved in media buying decisions; the CMO is responsible. Now, in this political environment, the CEO is getting involved,"" the media buyer added.
    

        Ruben Schreurs, the CEO of the marketing consultancy Ebiquity, which works with 70 of the top 100 global advertisers, said it's seeing isolated cases of advertisers coming back to the platform, ""but as of yet, no signs of a mass return.""
    

        Apple, for example, which stopped spending on X in 2023, bought ads on X again this month, MacRumors earlier reported and BI confirmed. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

        — Apple (@Apple) February 10, 2025


        But Ebiquity's analysis of client spending found that just one of its clients was spending on X in December, down from 13 clients in December 2023.
    

        Still, at least one data source suggested X had seen an uplift since the election. That was Guideline, an analytics firm that aggregates data from the world's largest media-buying agencies.
    

        Its data showed there was a 123% uplift in US spending on X from these major agencies year over year in December — the first full month of data after the election — and further 42% year-over-year growth in January. This came from a low base, though, as X had experienced two years of consistent year-on-year ad spend decreases in the 60% to 80% range, per Guideline's data.
    

        It also looks like spending in February from these agencies will be up 25% year over year, though this estimate from Guideline is based on forward bookings of early advertiser commitments and subject to change.

Now that streaming subscriber growth has slowed, we’ve noted repeatedly how the streaming TV sector is falling into all of the bad habits that ultimately doomed traditional cable TV.
That has involved chasing pointless “growth of growth’s sake” megamergers and imposing bottomless price hikes and new annoying restrictions (like equating password sharing with “piracy”) — all while simultaneously cutting corners on product quality in a bid to give Wall Street that sweet, impossible, unlimited quarterly growth it demands.
Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ (all now owned by the same company thanks to consolidation) all recently raised prices to access streaming catalogs of deteriorating quality. Some of Disney’s price hikes were as much as 25 percent, hitting ad-based and ad-free versions alike. Customers were quick to complain.
So not surprisingly, Disney+ has now seen the first quarterly subscriber loss in the streaming platform’s history, with 700,000 customers cancelling service. ESPN+, ESPN’s streaming service, also saw a 700,000 subscriber loss:
“Total paid Disney+ subscriptions currently rest at 124.6 million compared with 125.3 million at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter. ESPN+ also saw a loss of 700,000 subscribers, currently at 24.9 million, compared with 25.6 million at the end of last quarter.”
Publicly-traded companies can’t just provide a quality, affordable service people like. That’s simply not allowed. 
They have to provide Wall Street ever-escalating quarterly returns in the pursuit of scale, even if that pursuit proves disastrous. If it’s not possible to achieve those returns through innovation and subscriber growth (which is no longer possible now that the streaming market is saturated), that’s when big companies get in trouble and start creatively nickel-and-diming their user base.
Traditional cable TV, of course, went through this exact life cycle. And despite the fact many of those executives have shifted over to streaming, they’ve learned nothing from history or experience because they’re not financially incentivized to learn from experience. They’re incentivized to make stock values climb at any cost, then flee when things get rough; fat executive or investor compensation in hand.
Which is to say don’t expect things to change, even if the economy tightens and customers increasingly balk at higher streaming video prices.
I’d expect two major trends in streaming over the next few years. One, a significant uptick in pointless, shitty mergers that trigger layoffs, huge debt loads, more price hikes to recoup that debt, and steady product quality erosion (see: the whole AT&T→Time Warner→Discovery mess). Media execs are very excited for the Trump administration to rubber stamp even more problematic consolidation.
Two, I suspect companies will work tirelessly to make cancelling streaming services (a major advantage over traditional bloated cable TV) more difficult, whether that means complicated wireless/broadband bundling that makes dumping services a confusing hassle (is your Hulu subscription discount tied to your Amazon or wireless bill?), or some creative new restrictions we haven’t seen previously.



	Filed Under: disney plus, enshittification, espn plus, price hikes, streaming, television, tv, video


	Companies: disney

In terms of entshittification, Disney has made it even worse: the ad-free subscription tier is no longer a guarantee of avoiding ads.
If I didn’t know any better, I would say they’re actively trying to get people to pirate their content.
TBF, Disney’s only following Amazon in enshittification.
I dunno about that. Changing the terms and conditions just so people can’t sue for false advertising is more shitty to me.
It sounds bad, and I haven’t reviewed the specific agreements, but many web site agreements require users to hold them harmless and even indemnify them. In other words, if you sued them, you’d be paying their legal bills and any amount the court awarded you.
In theory. It’s such an absurd result that it’s hard to believe a court would uphold it; I’m not sure any company’s even tried. My point is, “you can’t sue for false advertising” is actually a much better clause than the usual “you can’t sue for anything ever”.
(I found such a clause in the terms of the payment provider my landlord wanted me to sign up with—a company that wanted access to pull money directly from my bank account while offloading all responsibility for their errors onto me. Needless to say, I complained, and I’m using checks again like it’s the 1980s.)

  In theory. It’s such an absurd result that it’s hard to believe a court would uphold it; I’m not sure any company’s even tried. My point is, “you can’t sue for false advertising” is actually a much better clause than the usual “you can’t sue for anything ever”.

Oh, no worries, Disney covered that as well.
People really need to start treating this shit as they’d treat actual contracts. If Disney handed guests a binder of legalese to sign before being let into the park, well, the lawyers would be happy, because their kids would be walking right onto otherwise-deserted rides. But the company would probably have to backtrack pretty quickly, just as Walmart would if they made everyone sign the printed walmart.com agreement and its ancillary policies before entering a store.
Somehow, if it’s online, people will be eager to agree to literally almost anything.
I find that people sign paper contracts in person that are also onerous and stupid because society has forced them to turn off their brains and has forced them to blow exorbitant amounts of cash they don’t have on things they wouldn’t need if they wern’t structured to force these needs. Then there are also those who sign just cuz they want stuff, which is also frequently a social disease.
So, should it be called “endisneyfication”?
That was already a thing, but you can roll all the stupid Disney behaviors up in that coinage.

  [I]s your Hulu subscription discount tied to your Amazon or wireless bill?

They almost got me with the last one until I read the fine print.
So Disney+ lost 700k customers. On a total of over 150 million subscribers, that’s less than half a percent. I imagine their departure was more than made up for with the price hike for the remaining customers.
I guess the beancounters are striving for a balance between raising prices fast enough to appease the stock market and slow enough so less customers bail.
Anyway, they’re not in this business for the entertainment value or the service to their customers.
Hard to say. Even if they’re making the money back from increasing fees, it doesn’t look good to the shareholders that they lost almost 1.5 million subscribers across two platforms.
Especially for the ad-based products.  If raising prices results in fewer subscriptions but the total profit is up, I can’t see investors having an issue with that.  But if raising prices is impacting ad impressions… THAT has a cascade effect.
It’s shocking they have that many subscribers given how Usanians keep complaining they can’t even afford food.
Subscribe through a burner credit card.

  Subscribe through a burner credit card.

That’s a better answer than simply no longer paying their monthly bills.  But I must confess, how does one obtain a ‘burner’ card… without being totally dishonest about one’s identity in the first place?  Credit issuers have their own rules about these kinds of things, let alone the laws regarding fraud, etc.
My version of a ‘burner’ is where my debit and credit cards are issued by a credit union.  At my union, I have the power to designate a black list of companies no longer permitted to lay charges against my card/account.  Wherein I am honest and don’t wait for the service provider to cut me off, I simply stop using the service entirely, on my own.  My premise is that if they turn me into collections, they’ll have to provide documentation that I never tried to cancel through their ‘official’ channel(s), and that I did indeed use the service and then failed to pay for it.  I’ve told more than one collection outfit to get me those proofs, beyond just a simple billing statement, and for sure, it’s never happened.  It’s worked so far.
N.B. Note that states may have different laws regarding the necessary proof.  What I described is what my state requires, your state may be different.  I do know that collectors will try to skate around these laws and brute-force you into paying, but hold your ground.  Or at the very least, get educated on what your state allows (or requires) a collector to do.
I use virtual credit cards. If they won’t let me unsubscribe then I can just cancel the card.
It works because the amounts are too small to take you to court, or for a debt collector to put in much effort. But, technically, you’d be on the hook for fees till you canceled, and we don’t know whether a court would accept a “it was too hard to cancel” defense.
It’s getting very visible in my bubble. Piracy is flourishing again.
Of course these companies will point to piracy as the cause of their losses, no the consequence as it actually is. And they’ll extract huge figures incompatible with their actual self-imposed losses and generally taken from their collective arses.
could boycotts also be affecting subs?
700k subscribers lost against 125 million overall, with 24 million on ESPN+ alone, means total subscribers went down 3%, which isn’t nothing. It is directly tied to the price increase from $9.99 to $15.
It does feel like the current strategy of all major businesses is to kill themselves, from Reddit and Twitter locking their APIs to Netflix and Disney+ increasing their prices for no good reason. Tesla went from being the cool electric car company to the car people are embarrassed to drive and have to slap bumper stickers on saying they bought it before Elon became a fascist president unelect. Most of Teslas revenue last year was from licensing [https://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-crypto-tesla-earnings-stock-elon-musk-trump-accounting-ev-2025-1?op=1](and selling cryptocurrencies), it seems.
All that being said, you forgot to call anyone brunchlords, Karl, so this article is bad and you are a monster. I made this account to leave this comment. Thumbs down, unsubscribbled. Disgusting. #dobetterkarl
Rough back-of-the-envelope est is ESPN/ABC is locked into ~$4B/yr in sportsball contracts. To make it worse, NBA ratings are down 5% this year. So losing even 700K subscribers is going to leave a mark

  It does feel like the current strategy of all major businesses is to kill themselves

It may feel like it, but is it happening? Are they dying? Certainly Disney isn’t. Video entertainment is an oligopoly, and the copyright monopolists can abuse their position to withhold stuff from any companies who’d want to undercut them. People still refer to permissionless downloading as “piracy” and illegal (which it’s not in most countries), and have a general feeling of “wrongness.”
I think it’s too soon to tell with Tesla. It could end up like Enron, but for now its stock price and sales remain high. “Fascist president unelect” might be a selling point for Trump voters who wouldn’t otherwise be interested in electric cars.

  People still refer to permissionless downloading as “piracy” and illegal (which it’s not in most countries), and have a general feeling of “wrongness.”

I’m not sure that’s true. Piracy is a copyright violation almost everywhere.
Unless you mean de facto legal, then yeah.

  I’m not sure that’s true. Piracy is a copyright violation almost everywhere.

Uploading copyrighted stuff without permission is usually illegal (though rarely criminal at non-commercial scale). Downloading is usually not, and in fact is sometimes explicitly legal due to copyright levies.

  they’ve learned nothing from history or experience

To be fair, it’s not that they don’t learn. Capitalism dictates that revenue must go up. If they weren’t using the main leverage they have to make the line go up, they’d be replaced. Short of changing the rules of capitalism, there’s no other end than enshittification for such large enterprises.

For companies in industries heavily reliant on channel sales, a well-structured partner program can be a game-changer—especially when preparing for an exit, whether it’s an IPO or a private equity sale. A robust program can drive scalable revenue, enhance operational efficiency and create a compelling narrative for potential investors.
In my experience leading regional operations and channel strategies, I’ve seen how a focused approach to building strong partner relationships can transform a company’s valuation. Here are key components of a partner program that can directly impact a company’s market value.
One of the most powerful aspects of a partner program is its ability to scale revenue without proportionately increasing costs. By designing tiered incentives that reward high performance—such as rebates, co-marketing funds and exclusive training—companies can drive their partners to achieve ambitious growth targets.
For example, in a prior role, I developed a new model that addressed market needs while allowing our partners to continue selling their own services or transition from traditional resellers to Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs). The result: 31% of our total revenue came from a combination of established and newly developed MSSPs. To achieve this, we restructured our partner incentives into two distinct, high-impact tiers:
• Disti-Led: Managed primarily by distributors, this tier focused on automating the long-tail space, allowing for greater scalability in handling smaller accounts. By leveraging customer connections, providing automated quoting, enabling partners and offering aggressive extra rebates, we ensured that even smaller partners had the resources to grow profitably.
• Channel-Led: This tier was managed directly by our team and focused on high-value partners with the potential to expand their services within existing accounts. These partners received specialized attention, additional enablement resources and strategic support to accelerate their transition to MSSP models.
By separating the incentive structures for these two segments, we optimized partner engagement and improved sales efficiency. This contributed to a CAGR of over 25% and proved so effective that the disti-led model was later implemented globally to standardize processes, drive recurring revenue and cross/upsell at scale.
Investors value predictability. By enabling partners to transition from one-time hardware sales to recurring subscription models, companies can significantly boost Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR). MSSPs, in particular, play a critical role in this shift.
In one instance, when we equipped MSSPs with tailored tools and resources, we tripled Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) in under two years. This success was driven by a strategic and compelling compensation model that incentivized both our teams and partners. At the same time, we maintained a focused effort to prevent cannibalization of existing annuities, ensuring that growth came from new business opportunities rather than shifting existing revenue streams. This kind of expansion signals to potential buyers or investors that the company has a resilient and scalable revenue base, making it a more attractive acquisition target.
When preparing for an exit, operational efficiency is a key metric for valuation. A partner program that standardizes processes globally—from deal registration and onboarding to reporting—reduces complexity, ensures compliance and enhances the partner experience. Investors see value in a seamless, replicable system that can scale across markets.
Empowering partners to succeed requires providing the right tools and resources. A simplified, centralized platform for deal registration, training and certifications ensures partners can efficiently sell and support the company’s solutions.
Trust is the foundation of any successful partner ecosystem. Transparent KPIs, frequent communication and recognition programs build loyalty and motivate partners to go the extra mile. Investors value a strong, loyal partner network as it reduces churn and ensures long-term stability.
For instance, recognizing top-performing partners through awards and providing priority access to new products can strengthen relationships, leading to higher retention rates and increased partner-driven revenue.
Introducing a global perks program for top-tier partners, such as Platinum partners, incentivizes them to prioritize selling the company’s platform. Perks can include higher margins, dedicated account managers, priority marketing funds and early access to new technologies. These exclusive benefits can drive loyalty, increase platform adoption and enhance overall partner performance.
For example, in a prior role leading operations in Latin America, we implemented a highly targeted perks program designed to directly incentivize the sales force of our key partners, including MSSPs, resellers and value-added distributors (VADs) in the lower metal tiers. With the approval of these partners, we structured incentives that rewarded partners' sales reps for positioning our solutions over competing products. This proved effective for transactional sales and accelerating platform adoption among companies selling multiple cybersecurity brands. Additionally, this model provided a mechanism to drive targeted sales efforts, ensuring a strategic push for specific products when needed. By aligning incentives directly with partner sales teams, we saw record-breaking growth and increased partner engagement. This also made our solutions more attractive compared to competitors, reinforcing investor confidence in the program’s ability to sustain and scale revenue growth.
A well-structured partner program creates a compelling story for potential buyers or investors. It demonstrates scalability, operational efficiency and revenue predictability—critical qualities for achieving a strong valuation.
During a previous valuation process, implementing a unified partner portal streamlined operations, eliminated regional inconsistencies, such as differences in discount structures across markets and varying levels of required partner certification and improved reporting accuracy (always respecting the potential of each market/territory). Prior to this, some regions operated with outdated manual discount approval processes, while others had disparate requirements for accessing marketing development funds. By standardizing these elements, we ensured a smoother, more transparent experience for partners and an easier-to-manage structure for the business, reducing administrative overhead and increasing partner satisfaction.
A well-designed partner program is more than just a sales channel; it’s a strategic asset that can significantly enhance a company’s valuation. By focusing on scalable growth, recurring revenue, operational efficiency and strong partner relationships, companies can position themselves as attractive opportunities for IPOs or private equity buyers.
However, it’s essential to localize these programs to adapt to regional characteristics. For example, EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) often aligns more closely with LATAM and APJ (Asia Pacific) in terms of taxation policies, culture, target addressable market and the pace of technology adoption, rather than the U.S. While maintaining a globally unified framework, making slight tweaks for emerging markets ensures the program remains effective and manageable worldwide without losing its essence or scalability.
For leaders preparing their organizations for an exit, investing in a strong partner ecosystem is not just an option—it’s a necessity. When done right, it becomes a cornerstone of sustainable success and a key driver of valuation in an increasingly competitive market.

	Over the last six years, thanks in the main to the SVOD revolution, Spain, once known for select auteurs – Pedro Almodóvar, J.A. Bayona, Fernando Trueba – has stepped fully onto the world stage as a European film and TV power. 

	Appropriately then, Spain is the Country in Focus 2025 at Berlin Festival’s European Film Market. Its movie strand says much about Spanish cinema, while Berlin, at large, points up Spain’s larger film industry challenges, shared by much of Europe.

	The Focus’ biggest takeaway is Spain’s dramatic explosion of new talent, both producers and directors. In a Spain at the Forefront showcase, 10 Spanish producers making up a Producers Program will talk up their companies and current projects. Another 10 producers form part of Visitors Program at the Berlinale Co-Production Market.

	Launched in 1995, Morena Films (“Che”, “Everybody Knows”) will unveil “8,” the latest from “Sex and Lucía” helmer Julio Medem. Avalon, producer of Berlin Golden Bear winner “Alcarràs,” will unpack “Iván and Hadoum,” the feature debut of Ian de la Rosa, who’s drawn heat from co-writing HBO hit “Veneno.” 




			Popular on Variety		






	Otherwise, 18 of the 20 production houses featured at Spain in the Forefront were launched this century and 13 last decade or this.

	Since 2018, when Spain’s “Money Heist” gave Netflix its first non-English series blockbuster and Netflix announced its first European Production Hub in Madrid, Spain has stood out as a permanent global streamer power.

	Over July 2023-June 2024, Netflix users watched 3.28 billion hours of titles from Spain, just beaten by Korea (8.19 billion), but the second-best performance of any country outside the U.S., doubling French-language viewing, according to Omdia.

	Meanwhile, Spain’s ICAA film agency – as part of the brief of its 2021 $1.7 billion Spain European Audiovisual Plan – has sought to shorten the gender gap and forefront new talent.

	That will show at Berlin. “Since 2006, Inicia Films has been dedicated to nurturing a new generation of filmmakers,” says founder Valérie Delpierre, one of the Berlin Country in Focus presenters. With Clara Simon’s “Summer 1993” and Pilar Palomero’s “Schoolgirls,” Inicia helped launch the nearest Spain has come to a recent film movement: a new generation of cinema, often from women, grounded in a sense of place but addressing global issues. 

	










	The most recent story of Spain’s arthouse cinema, however, has been a growing diversification, often into more mainstream plays. Backing Victor Erice’s “Close Your Eyes,” Pecado Films, also featured at Berlin, is now also driving into animation and minority international co-production. Inicia Films is prepping “Aitas,” a broad comedy from Borja Cobeaga, co-writer of “Spanish Affair,” which grossed $55 million in Spain.

	So potential highlights at Spain at the Forefront display a broad gamut: Alba Sotorra’s teen sorority themed “Wolf Grrrls”; Inicia’s animated feature “The Treasure of the Barracuda,” awarded in the same Eurimages funding round as “Flow”; La Cima’s touching reconciliation tale “Face to Face,” from Javier Marco (“Josephine”); Solita’s “Yesterday I Will Love You,” Guillermo Benet’s feature debut; Materia Cinema-Avalon’s doc feature “Qui Som,” on performing group Baro d’evel; and Ringo Media’s reaction to rape drama “Fury,” selected for SXSW, and La Vida DR’s Sitges FanPitch-selected “Salvaje,” about a female bounty hunter living in the mountains of 1871Europe’s.

	Spanish cinema has other things going for it. Spanish films domestic market share in 2024 edged up two percentage points to 19%. 

	Put that down to Santiago Segura whose “Father There is Only One 4” whose $14.0 million box office gave him the highest grossing Spanish movie in Spain for the fifth time in six years, as well as a newer market phenomenon.

	Three quality commercial films of social point made for adult audiences– terrorist org infiltrator thriller “Undercover,” heroic bus driver heart warmer “The 47” and dysfunctional Catalan family satire “A House on Fire – scored $8.4 million, $3.4 million and $3.2 million in Spain.

	“Other types of films are beginning to connect again with the public, which may well signal a change in the kind of films which will be made in Spain,” says producer Simón de Santiago, at Mod Producciones (“Agora”).

The Mediapro Studio, behind  “El 47” and Mike Leigh’s “Hard Truths,” has “pretty ambitious plans for films in the future,” says TMS’ Javier Méndez.

	“We defend films’ collective viewing in cinemas but all streamers ask for films and are ever more open to them having theatrical runs,” he adds, citing TMS and Pampa Films’ Disney+ hit “Mesa de regalos,” a wedding scam comedy, which has hit one million ticket sales in Mexican theaters and counting.

	










Movistar Plus+ has launched a slate of “event auteur films,” such as Rodrigo Sorogoyen’s “El ser querido” with Javier Bardem. 

	Challenges remain, however, for Spain’s film industry. 

	“There’s been a disconnect. When I went to film school, everybody wanted to be a Spielberg, Zemeckis or Scorsese. Now everyone wants to be like a socially driven, conscious filmmaker making lower budget films, and the system has adjusted to that,” says Nostromo Pictures’ Adrián Guerra.

	“The new tax schemes and the different national and local film agency subsidies have promoted a lot of the young talent, many young female auteurs, which is highly, highly positive,” says Alvaro Longoria, at Morena Films (“Che,” Champions”). “But this atomization of small movies by up-and-coming talents is taking the place of the bigger, larger, more industrial productions. I think it’s time to revisit this and try to take this talent to bigger, more commercial movies that travel.” 

	Mod Producciones is in post on “The Captive,” a Miguel de Cervantes origin tale. Morena is developing a big historical drama, “Malinche,” by  Pablo Trapero. 

	At Nostromo (“Through My Window,” “Apocalypse Z”), Guerra is co-producing Russell Crowe starrer “The Last Druid,” an AFM sales hit for AGC. The film is set up to be shot in Spain, with locations scouting taking place now.

	“Tax incentives are very strong in Spain. If you have the local knowledge on how to produce movies for a budget, the right crew and right know-how, you can get a big bang for your buck,” Guerra says.” In Nostromo’s case, we have a long experience with the tax incentive, reliable banks and investors that trust in us,” he adds.

Salesforce’s stock has lost 10% of its value in the two months since I wrote about Agentforce – the company’s agentic artificial intelligence service. For example, such services could plan a vacation; choose the best flights, hotels, and restaurants, and pay to lock in those reservations, as I noted in my book, Brain Rush.
Since then, a gap has emerged between suppliers of agentic AI and the technology’s potential customers, according to the Wall Street Journal.
My recent interview with a Salesforce partner and customer reveal agentic AI’s compelling potential benefits and a significant amount of work that must be done to realize those benefits.
That tension – coupled with growing macroeconomic uncertainty – could impede the rapid adoption of Agentforce and cap the upside of Salesforce stock.
Salesforce delivered an expectations-busting report on its performance and prospects last fall. Salesforce exceeded the Wall Street consensus for the quarter ending October 31 and raised growth guidance for the company’s fiscal fourth quarter which ended in January 2025, noted my December Forbes post.
The company touted Agentforce as a driver of growth. “Agentforce will be the number one supplier,” said Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff in an interview with Fast Company. “I think we’ll have more than a billion agents running from Salesforce within the next 12 months. Even at Dreamforce, I got 10,000 customers hands-on with Agentforce,” Benioff added.
One analyst expressed enthusiasm that made me wonder whether Agentforce could be a killer app for AI. “Intelligent agents in AI will change decision making and improve situational awareness in organizations through quicker data analysis and prediction intelligence,” wrote Tom Coshow, senior director with Gartner’s technical service providers division, in a Gartner report about intelligent agents in AI featured in Network World.
“While you’re sleeping, agentic AI could look at five of your company’s systems, analyze far more data than you ever could and decide the necessary actions,” Coshow added.
Another analyst provided a handy bullish forecast for the agentic AI opportunity. Specifically, the global market for such services was expected to end 2024 with $31 billion in revenue and to grow thereafter at a 32% annual rate for the next few years, noted Emergen Research.
Salesforce is betting on this opportunity. To turn demand for Agentforce into significant revenue, Salesforce said it was hiring more than 1,000 more people, noted CX Today. “Agentforce became available just two weeks ago and we’re already hearing incredible feedback from our customers,” Benioff said in a message released in November 2024, noted Bloomberg.
This month, Salesforce’s 2025 fiscal year began. While the company eliminated 1,000 jobs as it adds to its AI sales headcount, according to Bloomberg, there is evidence of a gap between the enthusiasm of agentic AI suppliers and the companies who are evaluating the technology.
Salesforce highlighted the business wisdom of such expense discipline. “Just because we have a hit new product doesn’t mean that we ignore the commitments we’ve made internally and externally as we think about scaling this business,” Salesforce Chief Operating Officer Brian Millham said at a December 2024 Barclays event, noted Bloomberg.
“We’re looking across the entire company to say, ‘Where can we get more efficiencies? How can we continue to get fuel for the work that we’re doing to go invest in scale going forward?”
One analyst expressed support for the strategy. The cuts speak “to the company’s focus on driving productivity and should help offset some of the incremental sales hiring that the company has already outlined,” wrote Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne in a report featured by Bloomberg.
Decades ago I was a member of the startup team for an AI company aiming to help personal financial planners work more efficiently with their customers. The venture ultimately failed because personal financial planners perceived the product’s price to exceed its value to them.
That is why my antennae perked up when reading about the enthusiasm gap between agentic AI suppliers and potential customers.
How so? Top information technology leaders attending The Wall Street Journal’s February 11 CIO Network Summit in Menlo Park, Calif. expressed skepticism of the technology, the Journal wrote. Due to a “lack of reliability,” while 61% of attendees are experimenting with AI agents, 21% said they’re not using them at all, a Journal poll found.
Vendors assured potential customers they should ignore agentic AI’s flaws or they would fall behind their rivals. “Accept that it is imperfect,” co-founder and CEO of agentic AI startup Sierra and chairman of OpenAI, Bret Taylor said at the summit, according to the Journal. “Rather than say, ‘Will AI do something wrong’, say, ‘When it does something wrong, what are the operational mitigations that we’ve put in place to deal with it?’”
One way for companies to implement Salesforce’s Agentforce service is to partner with independent software vendors with expertise in the company’s industry.
A case in point is Zurich, Switzerland-based Adecco, a $24 billion staffing firm – which is partnering with Bullhorn, a Boston-based staffing ISV – to implement Salesforce’s customer relationship management and Agentforce services. “Agentforce operates horizontally to coordinate AI agents but someone needs to do the recruitment vertical,” Bullhorn President and Chief Operating Officer Matt Fischer told me in a February 6 interview.
“We automate the top of the recruiting funnel to make sure candidates have a good experience. Many applicants fall into a black hole. People apply for a job and do not get a response. Agentforce has the potential to provide personalized communication and help match job opportunities"" to each candidate, he added.
There remains much work to be done to realize this vision. “Agentforce is new, it’s early, you’ve got to experiment, you have to do the work,” Fischer told me. “The candidate experience is currently suboptimal – 90% of the talent is having a poor experience – they never hear back that it’s not a fit,” he added.
Bullhorn is working on an approach that could deliver personalized messages. “Retrieval augmented generation – training the AI based on your company’s proprietary content – can improve the” customer experience, he added.
Bullhorn sees potential business benefits of agentic AI. “It could deliver the ability for staffing firms to grow without limits,” he said. “A recruiter gets 100 candidates and makes two or three placements. Deploying AI to qualify and screen those candidates would enable the recruiter to interview the best candidates and free them up to get more job orders,” concluded Fischer.
Adecco sees the potential to realize this vision. “We are aiming to increase our fill rate and reduce our time to fill,” Adecco Chief Digital and Information Officer Caroline Basyn told me in a February 11 interview.
Bullhorn is helping Adecco to become more productive. “Bullhorn is integrating Salesforce services to help with search and match – filling orders at the maximum possible rate as fast as possible with the best quality candidates,” Basyn said.
“Our top 300 customers – out of 150,000 total – account for 50% of Adecco’s business. Of those top 300, we have a fill rate ranging from 40% to 99%. We have been focusing on putting the supply chain closer to our customers to improve our fill rate, which would increase revenue even as we reduce the time to fill the jobs,” she concluded.
Analysts see value in Salesforce stock. The 41 analysts who offered 12-month targets see 20% upside in the stock to reach the average target of $396.94, notes TipRanks.
It could be a year or more before Agentforce makes a difference to Salesforce’s revenue. “Agentforce has renewed customer engagement, but it likely won’t become a major revenue driver until fiscal 2027 (calendar year 2026),” Piper Sandler analysts led by Brent Bracelin wrote in an investor note featured by InsiderMonkey.
If AI agents help drive more cross-selling and increase average revenue per user, Salesforce’s subscription growth could rise “in the medium term,” added Bracelin.
With retail sales down 0.9% in January and a possible Trump recession looming, companies could decide to hold off on agentic AI spending as they trim costs. Were that to happen, Salesforce shares could fall.

                    Predictions of a looming music industry apocalypse, fueled by users of LimeWire and similar peer-to-peer apps, have long-since been replaced by all-you-can-eat music services. In Japan, most formats are celebrating double-digit growth, and even the CD market is holding its own. Meanwhile, the major record labels have targeted 20 ISPs to obtain the personal details of BitTorrent pirates, seeking damages for infringements dating back over two years.
        




The Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) has around 65 members including Sony, Universal, and Warner. For good reason it’s seen as the local equivalent of America’s RIAA. 
The global music industry is currently in good health and Japan is no exception. In a recent report, RIAJ Chairman and Sony Music Entertainment CEO Shunsuke Muramatsu said that 2024 marked the 11th consecutive year of growth in the domestic market. In common with Western markets, streaming is the driving force. Somehow, Japan’s love affair with the CD is still producing steady sales too. 
2024 is expected to produce more sales in Japan than any year in history, including eight “Diamond Certified” tracks and at least one track achieving “Double Diamond” status with over a billion plays. Things could hardly be better, but this is the recording industry, where existential threats are rarely far away.
Concerns over copyright-skirting generative AI and its potential effect on the future market for music, is perhaps the most obvious example. Yet for reasons that aren’t entirely clear, BitTorrent pirates – who mostly departed for the legal market years ago or found more recent solace in YouTube-ripping platforms, are now being tracked down in Japan by the RIAJ.
This week the RIAJ reported success following legal action at the Tokyo District Court. In what appears to be action designed to send a deterrent message, RIAJ members requested information held by a local ISP on subscribers identified by the labels as prolific uploaders of pirated music.
“On February 7, the Tokyo District Court handed down a ruling ordering Internet service provider KDDI to disclose the names, addresses, etc. of users of IP addresses who have been illegally uploading large amounts of music files to the Internet using the file sharing software BitTorrent,” the RIAJ announcement reads. 
“Member record companies of the Recording Industry Association of Japan hold the rights to these audio sources. The same court handed down a similar ruling against [ISP] SoftBank on January 23.” 
The RIAJ says that the aim was to identify those behind just 25 IP addresses, spread across a total of 20 internet service providers. Whether a similar number of alleged pirates could’ve been spotted at fewer ISPs isn’t clear. The signs suggest that the RIAJ may be preparing for a larger campaign with ISPs’ cooperation established in advance.
The requests for disclosure were made pursuant to Article 5, Paragraph 1 of the Act on Limitation of Liability of Internet Service Providers; the record companies say they intend to file damages claims for copyright infringement and violations of neighboring rights, including the right to make content available for distribution 
From a total of 20 ISPs, two refused to disclose subscriber information. The RIAJ responded by filing a complaint at the Tokyo District Court in 2024, with its request for disclosure of subscriber information now a confirmed success.
“The association’s member record companies are currently in discussions with illegal uploaders through their attorneys regarding ‘pledges not to infringe copyrights in the future’ and ‘payment of damages’ based on the identities disclosed by internet service providers linked to the 21 IP addresses.”
As of February 12th, the RIAJ says it had reached settlement agreements with 11 uploaders, with average damages of approximately 500,000 yen, around US$3,300. 
Claims for damages against illegal uploaders are reportedly part of the mix, with the RIAJ stating it will continue to target file sharers and pirates using other means, to protect the market and “eradicate violations of copyright law.”

79,2025-02-14,"Airbnb (ABNB+14.79%) jumped more than 14% on Friday to about $161 per share after profit and revenue for the final three months of 2024 beat expectations. The company said it has seen “continued strong demand” in the current quarter. The stock remains below its 52-week high.
While Airbnb’s revenue forecast for the start of 2025 of $2.23 billion to $2.27 billion is slightly lower than analysts expected, it said the key “nights and experiences” metric is showing “relatively stable” growth. Airbnb also plans to invest up to $250 million on new businesses to be introduced starting in May, CFO Ellie Mertz said.
“We are not going to launch separate apps or separate brands,” CEO Brian Chesky said on the earnings call, according to a transcript. “We’re going to have one app, one brand, the Airbnb app. We want the Airbnb app kind of similar to Amazon (AMZN-0.77%), to be one place to go for all of your traveling and living needs.”
Mertz said investments will roll out throughout the year, with the greatest impact felt in the first nine months of 2025. Airbnb nonetheless expects to maintain strong profitability, with a full-year adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 34.5%, she added.

80,2025-02-14,"BCN is a top retail sales data aggregation company for the Japanese market. It gives us an excellent idea of what and who sells in Japan. I would imagine that BCN, outside of China’s sales data, probably drives a lot of what Japanese companies do regarding products.
So why do you care? The companies near and dear to our little hearts are Japanese-based companies. They have a strong sense of tradition and pride in the Japanese market. Also, the Japanese market usually allows us to see trends early. As trends start to happen in Japan, we see these trends ripple out to other regions afterward.
It should be noted that BCN is simply units sold. Lower-cost cameras tend to sell in more volume than higher-cost items, so the data can be a bit disproportionate when it comes to total value market share.
According to BCN, Sony continues to sell very well in Japan and controls the market with 29.7% of retail sales; Canon is second with 26.3% of the market share.
In the above graph, grey is Sony (29.7%), red is Canon (26.3%), and green is Fujifilm (15.9%). The rest of the market is represented by pink (28.1%)
The Canon EOS R50 was the top-selling camera in Japan for January 2025, but Canon was fairly quiet in the top 10, only having the EOS R10 and EOS R50.
Fujifilm continues to do well with the X-M5, which also caused Fujifilm to move into the number 3rd overall position for the first time since last August, overtaking Nikon by gaining 4.6% over the prior month.
Nikon continues to struggle somewhat with sales, and for the life of me, I have no idea why that is.  I know Nikonians will state that Nikon isn’t chasing the volume and market share, but that’s a bad way of doing things.  Mount market share is essential, especially when you want to attract third-party manufacturers to make stuff for your cameras. It is usually a good indicator of how active the used market is and, as well, simply your presence in the market.
The top cameras in Japan for January 2025 are;
I know the sharp-eyed ones out there will notice the PEN E-P7 on the list. That usually happens when a company dumps a camera onto the market at large discounts and also with multi-lens kits. Those tend to distort the market a bit, as they are volume sellers in Japan.

A pivotal and long-anticipated policy shift from the new Trump Administration, this decision removes one of the most significant regulatory roadblocks preventing large financial institutions from custodying crypto assets. By unlocking institutional access to crypto, it paves the way for a surge of traditional financial service providers to enter the market, driving increased liquidity, legitimizing crypto as an asset class, and accelerating institutional adoption at an unprecedented scale.
What Was SAB 121?
Issued on March 31, 2022, SAB 121 required public companies holding crypto on behalf of their customers to record customer-held crypto assets on their balance sheets as both an asset and a corresponding liability at ‘fair value.’ The result was burdensome accounting procedures and increased capital and compliance demands that discouraged banks from offering crypto custody services.
The rescission of SAB 121 reduces this burden, opening the door for banks and large custodians to enter the crypto market at scale.
1. Large Banks And Custodians Will Offer Crypto Custody Services
Through the exploration of tokenised real world assets, large banks and traditional financial services have already built the infrastructure necessary to support digital asset custody. For many, extending these platforms to crypto is a logical and technically straightforward next step, and a number of banks are primed and ready to enter this market.
For example, Bank of New York Mellon (BNY) already supports 80% of the approved Bitcoin and Ether Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) through its fund services business, and has publicly indicated its intention to extend their services into crypto custody.
The entrance of these large established brands will reshape the competitive landscape, introducing significant competition for crypto-native custodians. Increased competition will spur innovative products and services, reduce custodial fees, and mitigate the concentration risk in the global crypto Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) market, where Coinbase is currently the custodian for a significant majority of the BTC and ETH assets under management for crypto ETFs.
2. New Market Participants Will Drive Liquidity, Stability, And Innovation
As traditional financial institutions begin to offer crypto custody services, there will be an influx of new investors into the crypto market. The familiarity of these trusted brands and the increased regulatory certainty will attract more participation from institutional investors, pension funds, alternative asset managers, and hedge funds.
This wave of institutional investors and capital will improve market liquidity, reduce volatility, and enhance price discovery. Additionally, the presence of large, regulated financial institutions will foster the development of new crypto investment vehicles, stablecoin custody, crypto lending, staking services, and digital asset-backed financial products.
By unlocking institutional capital, crypto markets will evolve beyond their historically fragmented, retail-driven nature, ushering in a more stable, mature, and sophisticated financial system.
3. Further and Broad Regulatory Clarity Will Follow
This development also marks the beginning of a broader shift towards a more pragmatic regulatory environment in the United States. SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce acknowledges that, “the Commission’s handling of crypto has been marked by legal imprecision and commercial impracticality” and announced a list of areas of focus for regulatory review and refinement, including coin and token offerings and crypto-lending and staking. Increased regulatory clarity and certainty in these areas will continue to drive institutional participation and broader market growth.
Conclusion
The rescission of SAB 121 is more than just a policy reversal - it is a pivotal moment that redefines the institutional crypto landscape. With major banks entering the custody space, institutional capital surging into the market, and clearer regulatory frameworks coming, crypto is poised for a new era of mainstream adoption.

83,2025-02-14,"An unfortunate knock-on effect of Trump's tariffs on aluminum imports will hit the packaging sector. While Coca-Cola is currently available in aluminum cans, the company revealed in an earnings call that ""if aluminum cans become more expensive, we can put more emphasis on PET bottles."" Reducing plastic use is not a priority of this administration, and Coca-Cola's shift won't ruffle any governmental feathers.
 
Breweries and beer drinkers will also be affected. Tour average beer manufacturer doesn't have the diverse portfolio of packaging options of a Coca-Cola, and those breweries heavily invested in aluminum packaging will have no choice but to raise prices.
Microbreweries in particular will be hard-hit. These smaller outfits lack the deep pockets of name-brand breweries, and being on the crunchier side of the market, have largely shifted to aluminum over bottles for environmental reasons. They also use tanks, kegs and brewing equipment made of steel, which is also subject to the new tariffs. They will need to raise costs in order to survive.
 
Also: Did you know that Coca-Cola has been experimenting with reusable glass bottles? Those make up 8.8% of their packaging portfolio—though sadly, they're primarily used overseas, in countries like Germany, Austria, Spain, South Africa and Vietnam. The company says they're available in ""select restaurants"" in the U.S., but doesn't name any. America remains a laggard in recycling concerns. 
 

I grew up with reusable bottles in Mexico for beer and soda, glass bottles. They also have reusable plastic bottles although in Mexico in the last 20 yrs they pour your soda in a plastic bag and stick a straw, just contributing to the trash pile. 
If nothing else I'm hoping people ask, ""Why don't we make that here?"" Not out of any jingoistic notion, but questioning why US companies have been offshoring so much of so many industries while consumers see no difference in retail prices. Tariffs do nothing but cause retailers to pass the cost on to consumers, but the reality is companies have been doing this for decades for no other reason than to make their profits go up, and letting production fall to such levels that we're no longer able to manufacturer some goods here is purely the fault of greed, not of economy or environmental concerns.
The US only has very small deposits of bauxite. The reason that the US relies on imports is geology. I can’t imagine there’s a significant labour saving (the usual reason for offshoring) by getting aluminium from Canada.

84,2025-02-14,"Louis Moinet Memoris Neo
“The planets are aligning to welcome 2025,” the email from Ateliers Louis Moinet promised. “Our watchmakers are carefully assembling the first STARMAN watches. These exceptional works conceal secrets related to our fascinating solar system. On a celestial tableau, the craftsmen meticulously arrange the planets as they stood on a date chosen by their future owner.”
If you’re a watch aficionado and lover of complications, your eyes may have widened at the promise of a timepiece concealing “secrets related to our fascinating solar system.” And while you may respect Rolex’s watch industry contributions, its refusal to explore complications beyond its own orbit of day dates and simple chronographs simply leaves you uninspired. To be fair, this same sentiment applies to many heritage brands – until you encounter Louis Moinet, an under-the-radar brand that has succeeded without being Rolex because it boldly goes where no brand has gone before.
“If you look at the history of watchmaking, it has always been both a business and an art,” Jean-Marie Schaller, owner and creative director of Louis Moinet, told me over Zoom. “Of course, we all have to pay the bills. But at the same time, it is—above all—an art. I regret to see that, today, some of us have lost this dimension. For them, it is just about the product, about market shares, about marketing concepts. But this is not what watchmaking is truly about. What it is, is not about products; it is about creations.”
JEAN-MARIE SCHALLER CEO AND CREATIVE DIRECTOR
“It is not about a customer,” Schaller added. “It is about a friend. It is about building a relationship, not selling a watch.”
Louis Moinet shifts watch buying from a retail transaction into something far more intimate. Personalization is an expectation, not an afterthought. A Louis Moinet watch isn’t merely sold; it’s curated into a personal collection where rarity outweighs ubiquity.
And herein lies the secret to Louis Moinet’s success apart from Rolex, particularly since “friendship” isn’t within the world’s most recognized watch brand’s marketing playbook. Schaller makes it central, dismissing mass production to create only 500 timepieces annually. Some models exist only in ultra-limited runs of 12 to 28 pieces total. And some, only as one-of-a-kind pieces, limited to just one of one, for the brand’s dearest friends.
“I purchased a unique Tempograph modified by Jean-Marie according to my wishes,” entrepreneur and Louis Moinet client, Pierre Abrezol, shared via email. “I asked Jean-Marie to modify the Tempograph watch because, for me, the notion of passing time on a watch is conveyed through the seconds’ hand. So, I asked him to change the color of this hand, originally blue, to red, which would make it stand out better.”
For the Louis Moinet customer, nay, friend, owning something with a name everyone recognizes is unimportant. What’s valued most is being able to wear horological artistry existing nowhere else but on their wrist. This is the very essence of luxury marketing and speaks to the consumers passionate pursuit of luxury. Luxury cannot exist without that emotional appeal, whispering private words into the customer’s heart.
“They like to talk about how they feel about the watch,” Schaller shared of Louis Moinet’s clients. “They like having something truly special on their wrist. We put in a great deal of effort to ensure that what we create is not just a simple customization, but something far more meaningful. We strive to connect the watch to both the DNA of Louis Moinet and the personal story of its owner.”
Louis Moinet Memoris Caliber Movement
But back to complications. After all, they are how I, as an engineer’s daughter with her father’s analytical mind, first fell in love with watches in my former Tourneau days. Various models from Jaeger LeCoultre initially piqued my interest, but it was handling the Girard-Perregaux Opera Three that secured my lifelong attention. This timepiece could play Mozart’s Ein Kleine Nachtmusik and Tchaikovsky’s No Great Love, without an orchestra or a battery!
Complications are any feature on a watch that goes beyond telling time. Showing the date or having a chronograph (a stopwatch) is considered a complication, but these are too simple for Louis Moinet. Take the brand’s Black Gold Derrick, a tourbillon whose entire movement – the watch’s brain, if you will – mimics the drilling process every oil man will recognize. A drive shaft powering the walking beam (the mechanism used to pull oil from the ground) is central to the watch’s design.
“The first time I saw this magnificent Louis Moinet brand was in a Porsche magazine,” Christophe Chappuis, entrepreneur and Louis Moinet customer shared. He was drawn to the brand by, “The beauty of the watch and its originality, these details of the movement and the possibility of making it unique by adding your personal touch when ordering.”
Personal touch is a recurrent theme in Louis Moinet’s business model. Collectors can request engraved celestial maps based on the precise arrangement of the stars on a personally significant date. Certain Louis Moinet models also allow for an actual piece of the cosmos to be displayed on the wrist.
Schaller has been collecting meteorites for over 20 years, beginning after finding an extraordinary, 100-year-old, highly complicated movement with a chronograph, minute repeater, perpetual calendar and a moon phase. This movement inspired Schaller to ask his team, “What can we do which is very special, which has never been made?”
Louis Moinet Cosmopolis made with 10 meteorites discovered around the world. 
Answering this question led to the Super Moon, a stunning and quite literal moon dial watch, accented with one of only 371 known lunar meteorites in existence. The dial is engraved to mirror humanity’s first view of the moon from space, captured in 1968 by Apollo 8. This watch became the brand’s entry point into the Omani royal court.
“I met somebody from Oman at a Basel trade show at the time,” recalled Schaller. “I showed him the watch, and I said, ‘Oh, by the way, this meteorite was found in Oman.’ He looks at me, and he said, ‘But I know the minister!’”
The Omani royal family has since become one of Louis Moinet’s most prominent collectors, acquiring pieces as gifts for others as well as for their private museum. As a result, the Middle East has become a strong market for the brand, as has the Japanese market. The company’s first customer and subsequent distributor after Schaller relaunched Louis Moinet in 2004 came from Japan.
While the limited Japan Rocket timepiece, made with fragments from the Japanese H-IIB rocket, a lunar meteorite and a Gibeon meteorite, is truly a thing of beauty honoring the brand’s deep-rooted connection with the country, it’s the yet unannounced upcoming creation Schaller teased that has me waiting with bated breath.
“We have a Japanese meteorite,” he began. “It's very rare to find a meteorite from Japan. It was super difficult to find. This meteorite fell in Japan when Louis Monet was alive. So we will make a limited edition of 12 pieces only for Japan.”
Louis Moinet Starman timepiece
The celestial connection is inherent to the brand. Louis Moinet – the man – was an astronomer, an inventor and an artist. A Renaissance man, he studied architecture, sculpture and painting in Rome, stone engraving in Florence, astronomy in Paris, and watchmaking in various Swiss cities. Moinet would go on to make extraordinary clocks and pocket watches for Napoleon Bonapart, Thomas Jefferson, James Monroe and quite a few emperors, queens and kings.
What is often a point of contention in the watch industry when it comes to who did what first, Moinet is the true original inventor of the chronograph. His 1816 Compteur de Tierces was the world’s first chronograph, measuring time to 1/60th of a second, an innovation far ahead of its time. Yet history forgot him until Schaller serendipitously discovered the Compteur de Tierces at a Christie’s auction in Geneva.
“Louis Moinet was the most important watchmaker after Breguet in the 19th century,” Schaller said. “But since 1853, unfortunately, he became a nobody, if I may say. There was a time span of 150 years where he was completely forgotten. And I had to rewrite a new book about Louis Moinet. I was blind because all the history—what you find today on the website—like that he was the inventor of the chronograph, like he crafted the most incredible pieces of art for the American presidents, Napoleon, and so on... All of this had disappeared.”
Jean Marie Schaller, Louis Moinet CEO, with Guiness World Record Title 
In restoring Moinet’s name in horological history, Schaller has introduced cosmic-inspired masterpieces earning both international acclaim and a world record. The 2023 launch of the Cosmopolis, a breathtaking tourbillon with hours marked by ten extremely rare meteorites found across the world, won the Guiness World Record for “Most Meteorite Inserts in a Watch” and “Design of the Year 2024” from Muse Design Award. The Jurassic Tourbillon, with a dial made from a 150-million-year-old fossilized dinosaur bone, won first prize in the International Chronometry Competition. Its seventh Red Dot Design Award in 2023 for Time to Race put the brand in the design hall of fame, along with luminaries like Apple and Ferrari.
With the Time to Race collection, personalization again takes the driver’s seat: each watch features a one- or two-digit “lucky number” chosen by the owner, rendered in colors reminiscent of iconic 1960s race cars. No two watches are alike.
“Being passionate about watches, I find the history of the Louis Moinet brand fascinating,” noted Chappuis, owner of a Time to Race marked with the number 74 (his birth year) and made with a custom apple green bracelet. “That a small factory can offer such objects in creation, originality and very high quality must be better known.”
Louis Moinet Time to Race in Blue
There is an emerging acquisition trend in the watch industry, which first caught my eye when Chanel acquired a 25 percent stake in MB&F, a watchmaker known for its avant-garde designs and experimental horology. Would Schaller ever consider such a partnership?
“During the years, I’ve received some offers, but no, no, no, no!” Schaller rejected. “They have a different view on business, and they would not have respected what is, in my opinion, the true essence of this name, Louis Moinet.”
Instead, he’s found an investor aiding in the company’s growth as Schaller retains complete control. Yet this growth doesn’t mean in annual production. “We want to keep the same recipe. We want to offer quality and special experience to our customers. We’ll take it from there, and we’ll see. In any case, if we grow, it will be in keeping the same concept.”
The idea of jumping from 500 to 5,000 pieces annually feels like a nightmare, as Schaller can’t conceive sustaining the ingenuity, high level of detail and precision at such quantities. The very essence of Louis Moinet’s business model is intimacy. Scaling production would erode the personal experience he’s cautiously cultivated.
“The best for all of us—for them and for me—is to meet in person, to understand each other, and to create something truly personalized. How many brands can offer a product of this rarity, so exclusive? We make only 500 pieces a year. If you own one that is uniquely made for you, you will never get that from brands who produce 100,000 pieces a year. This is what we are proposing.”
Jean-Marie Schaller Creative Director for Louis Moinet
Louis Moinet has turned storytelling into a core brand strategy. Every timepiece tells a story, with the brand’s website designed to draw you deeper and deeper into that story. You could lose hours on the site, exploring the dynamics of each creation. And this fundamentally is a key component to the brand’s success. It’s the stories the brand regularly tells that lure customers back to hear the latest tale.
“For me, Jean-Marie is the poet of watchmaking.” Abrezol responded to my question of what drew him to the brand. “He always chooses materials that are very original, and every one of his creations tells a special story that makes you dream.”
Here are four lessons for marketers looking to replicate Louis Moinet’s success:
Ensure every component of your product has an engaging story to tell; lead with the story to spark curiosity. While most luxury brands use premium materials to justify cost, Louis Moinet uses them as a narrative device. Meteorites, lunar fragments, and fossilized dinosaur bone are storytelling anchors which inspire intrinsic emotional value. A Louis Moinet watch is a historical artifact, not a status symbol.
Personalization is core to Louis Moinet’s business model, allowing customers to co-create as part of the purchasing process. Beyond simply owning a Louis Moinet, the customer also owns the story of its creation, a story no one else can ever have. The lesson? Bring customers into the creative process. Don’t underestimate the value of bragging rights in motivating consumer behavior.
Aggressive growth is less important to Louis Moinet than ensuring every one of its 500 watches produced annually never disappoints a client. Quality will always trump quantity. What you lose in targeting a large audience, you gain in establishing a pricing strategy based on what the market will bear, with the market being controlled by the emotional value you cultivate within your audience.
First and foremost, Louis Moinet customers are friends, each of whom Schaller has personally engaged to learn their preferences and construct watches reflective of their unique identity. This approach has fueled organic growth, as Louis Moinet friends introduce their friends to the brand. If you nurture intimate customer relationships, they will grow your market share for you.
Of the three Louis Moinet timepieces he owns, Abrezol counts the Jurassic Tourbillon his favorite.
“The dial is made of a dinosaur bone, and that takes me back to a time when life on our planet was totally different and no longer exists as such,” he shared. “Mankind was not a part of the world then. So wearing it means wearing a bit of our planet’s history. As I mentioned earlier, Jean-Marie and the Louis Moinet brand make us dream and travel in time, in history, and in space.”
It’s this emotional resonance, this ability to bridge history, the heavens, and horology, that’s made Louis Moinet a success without being named Rolex. The brand thrives not on ubiquity, but in capturing the imagination of those who seek something beyond time.

85,2025-02-14,"People walk past a Tommy Hilfiger store at a mall in Beijing on February 5, 2025. US firm PVH, which ... [+] owns Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, said February 5 it was ""deeply disappointed"" by China's decision to place it on the country's sanctions list. (Photo by ADEK BERRY / AFP) (Photo by ADEK BERRY/AFP via Getty Images)
PVH, the owner of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands, has been added to China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) list of “unreliable entities.” It got blacklisted because the country has determined PVH “undermines market rules and violates Chinese laws,” according to a statement issued by the MOFCOM.
By being put on the Chinese Ministry’s blacklist, it could effectively shut down all PVH business in China. As of yet, MOFCOM announced no specific sanctions and the company is given a timeframe to present its defense.
PVH is the first fashion brand to be so blacklisted, a designation typically reserved for defense and biotech companies, such as Illumina, which was also just added to the unreliable entities list. Up until now, only a handful of U.S. companies have been put on that list and none that operate in the consumer market.
The decision follows the Trump administration’s move to impose a 10% tariff on Chinese imports, though MOFCOM has been conducting an investigation into PVH’s China business since September.
In effect, PVH, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger are the first U.S. fashion brands to fall victim to the accelerating U.S.-China trade war over tariffs. More U.S. fashion brands are expected to face the same scrutiny.
“We are surprised and deeply disappointed to learn of the decision from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce,” a PVH spokesperson said. “In our 20 years of operating in China and proudly serving our customers, as a matter of policy, PVH maintains strict compliance with all relevant laws and regulations and operates in line with established industry standards and practices. We will continue our engagement with relevant authorities and look forward to a positive resolution.”
The MOFCOM decision stems from PVH banning the use of cotton from China’s Xinjiang region in its clothing. In that, PVH followed the guidelines of the U.S. government, which banned imports of Xinjiang cotton in 2020.
“There’s this tit-for-tat trade war going on, and [China] wants to show the United States that it’s going to take action to hurt either big U.S. companies or companies with significant interests in the U.S.,” Michael Kaye, a partner at the law firm Squire Patton Boggs, shared with CNBC. “They’re being made an example. My guess is, [China] wanted to pick somebody and they wanted it to be somebody that was high visibility.”
While PVH CEO Stefan Larsson said the Chinese market is important for its retail growth – the Asia-Pacific region accounted for about 20% of PVH’s $9.2 billion revenues in most recent fiscal year 2023, though it doesn’t report sales by country – the greater threat to PVH’s business may be to its manufacturing capabilities. It operates 128 factories in China that produce approximately 20% of its goods.
“This has the potential to be very, very disruptive for PVH,” said GlobalData’s Neil Saunders to CNBC. “While you can shift manufacturing capacity reasonably easily, it’s not so easy to guarantee the quality, guarantee the production processes. Those things take time to upskill. China has that capacity and has those skills, because PVH has been operating there for ages.”
PVH also operates 88 factories in Vietnam and 81 in Turkey, plus over 400 in other countries around the world. On the other hand, it has only one factory in the U.S.
Experts speculate China chose PVH to target, instead of other U.S. brands such as Nike and Gap, which also have a stated policy against using Xinjiang cotton, because it’s just big enough to get noticed, but not so big as Nike or Gap to cause major disruptions at home.
According to company reports, Tommy Hilfiger operates some 1,300 stores in the Asia-Pacific region and Calvin Klein in 2,700 locations. PVH also has a Hong Kong headquarters.
“There’s a sort of sword of Damocles hanging over [PVH’s] head, and that is exactly what this is, because this isn’t really about PVH at all. This is about PVH being caught in the spat between China and the U.S.,” Saunders said. “China is using PVH as an example to say, look, if tariffs go ahead, if other restrictions are put in place on China, we can make life difficult for U.S. companies in the country. That’s really what this is about.”

86,2025-02-14,"On the day I spoke by phone with André Corrêa do Lago, the newly appointed head of this year's United Nations climate conference, countries worldwide faced a deadline to publish new plans to tackle climate change. By that evening, only 13 had done so. 
It’s a startling number. The deadline applied to all 195 nations signed up to the Paris climate agreement. And it underscores the uphill challenge facing Corrêa do Lago, a Brazilian diplomat who previously served as the country’s chief climate negotiator. His job: to help foster collaboration and bring about fresh agreement in a world riven by populist nationalists intent on driving climate change down the global priority list.
“I naturally believe very much in multilateralism, and we believe that the only way of solving important issues is through cooperation,” Corrêa do Lago told me from Rio de Janeiro, as he prepares to host what will be the thirtieth such meeting—hence the name COP30—in the Amazonian city of Belém this November. “But the international context is quite complex.”
Central to the “complex” road ahead for him is the U.S. and the new Trump Administration, which he diplomatically called “challenging.” Back in power in Washington D.C., Trump has once again initiated the process to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, and it remains unclear what presence—if any—the country will have at UN climate talks. “We have to wait a little to see some of the directions that these policies are going to take,” Corrêa do Lago says of the U.S.
Read More: What Whiplash U.S. Climate Policy Means for Business
He does however remain optimistic about preventing further withdrawals from the Paris accord. Unlike traditional treaties, he notes, Paris relies on voluntary commitments rather than enforcement mechanisms. While some critics view this as a weakness, he argues it actually discourages withdrawal: countries gain little by leaving but risk facing trade barriers from climate-conscious partners. He has previously said that Argentina withdrawing from the Paris Agreement would threaten the joint trade deal between the European Union and Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. 
Indeed, trade is a key area of contention. Many developing and emerging market countries have expressed concern over the European Union’s measure to charge a carbon fee on certain imports. U.S. tariffs, and the threat of more to come, on longtime allies and rivals have also put a spotlight on the topic. Thus far, trade has played a largely peripheral role in UN climate negotiations, though last year Brazil and others sought to elevate it on the agenda. Corrêa do Lago cited it very early in our conversation as a key point of contention for countries and said that “starting to build some consensus on some of the issues of trade” would be “extremely important.”
Underlying such concerns is what for proponents of global action on climate change, such as Corrêa do Lago, is a sobering reality: the costs of climate policy, both real and perceived, have slowed progress in many places as voters turn to populist politicians who oppose multilateral action–and in some cases, outright deny the realities and consequences of a changing climate.  
To help keep momentum alive, Corrêa do Lago says he wants to refocus attention on not just solving the climate conundrum, but also, in a sense, selling its benefits. “This transition has to be dealt with in a rational way,” he says. “There are challenges for many sectors, and it can even eliminate many jobs… we have to make sure that we can convince people that this can bring very positive impacts.”
Part of that involves courting what has become an increasingly important constituency for climate leaders: the private sector. The role of business has become ever more prominent at UN climate conferences in recent years as the focus of climate talks has shifted to implementation. And Corrêa do Lago says there will be a substantial role for the private sector this year, too. “We want to focus on solutions,” he says. “And probably most of the solutions come from the private sector.”
The first challenge here will be making the private sector feel welcome–quite literally. Choosing Belém to host the conference—a remote city with limited accommodations and infrastructure—has led some beyond Brazil to ask whether the city will be able to support a big corporate turnout. Corrêa do Lago reassured companies that the hosts would facilitate the presence of industry. “We want the private sector to have an absolutely central role,” he says. “And we will make sure that the private sector will have accommodations and will be very welcome.”

Nonetheless, he acknowledged that the location would make the COP different from many of recent predecessors. “The symbolism of doing the COP in the Amazon, President Lula believes and I totally agree, is much more important than the infrastructure difficulties that may arise from it,” he says. 
The COP president job is a slog. For the next several months, Corrêa do Lago will hit the road traveling around the world to meet with key stakeholders sounding out positions and trying to build consensus. And yet the job has never been more urgent with global temperatures topping the 1.5°C goal laid out by the Paris Agreement and a slew of devastating climate linked events signaling the future we have in store.

87,2025-02-14,"If you own the Google TV Streamer, then you might have gotten an update notification on your device, which brings some unspecificied software changes to the rather inexpensive streaming box from Google. The update is also the second one for the device, with the first one having rolled out last year.
READ: Is the New Google TV Streamer the Nvidia Shield Successor We’ve Been Waiting For?
With that said, some users are now complaining that the new update has removed support for Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD audio. Previously, the two formats appeared as “detected” audio codecs although they weren’t supported at all since the TV Streamer’s launch last year. With the new update, it appears that the two formats are now nowhere to be found.

Compared to Google’s previous Chromecast model, the TV Streamer packs some upgrades including a newer design, a faster processor inside (up to 22% faster, according to Google), and even support for spatial audio when paired with the Pixel Buds Pro, to name a few. It’s also a bit more expensive than its predecessor (priced at $99), but it’s clear that Google wants to market the TV Streamer as its go-to “flagship” model.
In any case, we’re hoping that Google eventually brings support for Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD audio with the next TV Streamer Update.

Greene announced in November 2024 she would chair a new House Oversight subcommittee in the upcoming Congress, overseeing Musk’s work with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
On Jan. 8, 2025, Greene purchased Tesla shares in four different accounts, with each transaction falling between $1,000 and $15,000, according to a report she filed with the House Clerk’s Office.
A spokesperson for Greene did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A week after winning the election, Donald Trump tasked Elon Musk with leading DOGE, a government entity tasked to “slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure Federal Agencies.” Musk’s moves, which have decimated the United States Agency for International Development and the Consumer Financial Protect Board, have sparked a wave of lawsuits.
“The legislative branch can’t sit on the sidelines,” Greene said Wednesday in her opening statement at her subcommittee’s first hearing. “In this subcommittee, we will fight the war on waste shoulder to shoulder with President Trump, Elon Musk and the DOGE team.”
In January, Reps. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-Wash) and Zach Nunn (R-Iowa) introduced the No Corruption in Government Act, which would ban House members from trading stocks. The bill is currently in committee.
Before taking office in 2021, Greene held between $15,000 and $50,000 in Tesla stock. While her then-husband bought more shares in the electric vehicle manufacturer through his IRA in January 2021, Greene does not appear to have increased her holdings until late 2024 when she bought another $4,000 to $60,000 worth of shares.
Tesla traded between $387.40 and $402.50 on the day Greene made her latest purchases. On Thursday, it closed at $355.94, meaning Greene’s purchases were down anywhere from 8% to 12%.
In June 2024, Greene introduced an amendment to the 2025 defense budget that would ban funds from being used on electrical vehicles or electrical vehicle infrastructure.
In 2021, Greene purchased between $15,000 and $50,000 worth of shares in the shell company that was set to merge with Trump Media & Technology Group. By the following year, the shares vanished from her financial disclosures without any reported sale. Possible explanations: the value of the shares plummeted below the $1,000 reporting threshold or her then-husband, Perry Greene, got them in their divorce settlement.

EXCLUSIVE: Taiwanese production and sales outfit Flash Forward Entertainment has unveiled new titles for Berlin‘s European Film Market (EFM), including fantasy romance Time Loop With the Moon and Moonlight, Ripples!.

	Patrick Mao Huang leads Flash Forward, and he has co-produced titles like Karlovy Vary best director prize-winner Pierce, as well as Tiger Stripes, which picked up the Grand Prix at Cannes’ Semaine de la Critique in 2023.

	Huang unveiled Time Loop With the Moon as a new title on the company’s slate for EFM. Currently in development, the fantasy-infused coming-of-age romance was adapted from the best-selling novel of the same name by Misa.

	The project follows a teenage girl who makes a wish to reunite with her lost friend. She soon wakes up in the past, inhabiting the body of another person on the night of a tragic event. Trapped in an endless time loop, she must unravel the mystery behind the past and break the cycle before it is too late. A unique blend of romance, suspense and supernatural intrigue, the film explores fate, memory, and second chances.




			Watch on Deadline		






	Directed by Liu Zhong-Hua, fantasy mystery film Moonlight, Ripples! is currently in post-production and is expected to be completed in the second half of 2025. The film follows a man suffering from amnesia who wanders through a seemingly empty city, piecing together his past through three surreal encounters. As reality and imagination blur, he must confront buried memories that shaped his identity. Huang shared that the project is in advanced discussions to become a China-France co-production.

	Another title on the Flash Forward slate is sci-fi drama series Millennium Town. The series will follow a group of people trapped in an endless loop in 1999, forced to confront their pasts as they search for an escape. The project was recently selected for Series Mania’s Serial Bridges in France. 

	Already making its way around the global pitching circuit, documentary film Mothers in Transit explores the world of cross-border surrogacy, following Taiwanese couples navigating surrogacy in Ukraine and Thailand amid shifting regulations. The project has already been showcased at Locarno Match Me!, TCCF Pitching Forum, and Doc by the Sea Taiwan Project, securing funding from Taiwan’s Ministry of Culture Production Grant, and is currently seeking European co-production partners.

	










	Other titles on the company’s EFM slate include Blind Love, which made its world premiere in the Tiger Competition section at the recently-concluded International Film Festival Rotterdam (IFFR). The film is directed by Julian Chou and executive produced by Huang, and stars Ariel Lin, Ke-Xi Wu, and Jimmy Liu.

	Taiwan-Italy co-production Deep Quiet Room and Francois Chang’s The Sleepless Girl round off Flash Forward’s slate in Berlin. The company is also actively developing four immersive projects in collaboration with partners from France and Denmark.

90,2025-02-14,"Zeiss posted a teaser on Instagram yesterday showing an image taken with a Zeiss 85mm F1.4 lens.   While that is not that newsworthy on their own, they certainly did tease that Zeiss was coming out with something soon.
Zeiss had all but disappeared from the consumer market, focusing mostly on industrial lenses.  The Batis and Loxia lines have been discontinued and Zeiss themselves have not created a consumer / professional stills camera lens for over six years.
It certainly seems as if Zeiss is doing something, and a new Otus 85mm F1.4 would be a fantastic starting point.  SonyAlphaRumors received word from one of their sources;
Half a year ago, a guy I know who works for Zeiss in PR (and was also involved in marketing for the unfortunately failed ZX1) told me Zeiss is bringing out new lenses in a few months. Now if you look at zeiss imaging on instagram they are teasing something with an owl, so I guess it might be something Otus line related. May guess is an Otus line for mirrorless cameras as E-Mount and the like.
While that seems to be encouraging it’s certainly not a slam dunk.
Otus lenses if you recall had no electronic connections to the EF mount.  They are still available for the EF mount, for a mere $14,995 USD.
Zeiss has been hesitant on bringing electronic connected lenses to the EF mount in the past, because they are above the reverse engineering that third party EF lens manufacturers had to do. Given that mirrorless cameras overall play far nicer with lens data, I would imagine that Zeiss is looking to create the new mirrorless Otus lineup with electronic connections to the camera.  Since they have done this before with the Batis and Loxia lineup for the E-mount, they do have some experience with this.
SAR thinks that it’s possible we will see these Otus for mounts other than the E mount, and quite possibly for the RF mount.  I think we will as well, as this wouldn’t be something that Canon would feel threatened with, and it’s possible that the lens communication is redimentary enough for Canon to quickly sign off on it.  Or, Zeiss could keep with the Otus mystery and simply have a mechanical mount, and camera communcation be damned.  If it’s simply a mechanical lens mount with no connections, then I would put the RF mount as a near certainty.
The Zeiss Otus 85mm F1.4 for the DSLR mounts was a insanely great lens, with a equallly high price tag.  You got what you paid for.  Let’s pause and relieve memory lane from 10 years ago via Zeiss’s video.
Craig and I were used lens lusting a few weeks ago, and I said he needed to get the Contax/Yashica 21mm f/2.8 lens. Primarily because I wanted to borrow it from him.
I have long used Contax lenses on my EF cameras, and I miss that clinical sharpness and microcontrast that you get out of Zeiss. It will be good to see them re-enter the market, even if they decide to skip the RF mount for now.
What do you all think? Are you ready to sell a few kidneys to get some Zeiss primes?

92,2025-02-14,"Amazon is once again demonstrating that buying things in today’s world does not mean you actually own them. The company is closing a loophole that enabled owners of Kindle books to strip them of their anti-piracy protection and take them elsewhere.
Some avid digital books enthusiasts prefer other e-reading applications to Amazon’s Kindleâperhaps because another e-reader has a better color screen or other features not present on Kindle. The “Download & transfer via USB” tool was an old Kindle feature that allowed owners of e-books purchased through Amazon to be downloaded and transferred to another Kindle without using WiFi or Bluetooth. Clever individuals found that some older e-books used a file format with security measures that are easy to circumvent, meaning they could use the tool alongside other hacks to successfully transfer their books elsewhere. Now, books purchased through Amazon are effectively stuck there.
With the advent of digital books, publishers were unsurprisingly concerned that their books would quickly be ripped and uploaded to piracy websites. Amazon swooped in and developed proprietary formats that make it difficult for books to be accessed by anyone other than the purchaserâor even read them outside the Kindle app, for that matter. A standard security format would enable books to be transferred while protecting copyrights, but Amazon does not have an incentive to go with that.
That has, of course, been great for Amazon. The company was early into the e-book industry and the Kindle is synonymous with e-books; it accounts for 70% of the market. If you have a large collection of books you have purchased on Kindle, you kind of have to stay in its ecosystem. Furthermore, some books are only available on Amazon’s marketplace, and the company will always match the price of competing marketplaces since it really makes its money off the ads littering the site these days. While Amazon does have a monopoly in digital books, it would likely argue it is not a monopoly in the broader book category as Barnes and Noble sees a resurgence in popularity.
Users on sites like Reddit have shared workarounds over the years to take their purchased books elsewhere, but it has been something of a cat-and-mouse game, with successive updates by Amazon closing loopholes.
While Amazon has continued to release new Kindle devices under the new leadership of Panos Panay, critics believe that the company’s monopoly in e-reading has hindered innovation. Bookshop.org recently launched its own e-book store, where it hopes to entice readers by promising to send more money than Amazon back to independent stores and authors. But it will have an uphill battle convincing the e-reading public to use its service because its e-books cannot be read on a Kindle. Bookshop.org hopes to pressure Amazon into changing its practices so its e-books could be supported there. The hope is that someday, we will all live in a perfect utopia where books can be freely transferred anywhere, opening up opportunities for competing e-readers to stand a chance. For now, however, it does not seem like Amazon is too worried about losing its pole position. Most people looking for an e-reader just buy a Kindle and do not think too much about where the books come from.

Explore Cappi Forneria's fresh branding and visual identity, blending classic Italian elements with a modern, irreverent twist.
Cappi Forneria, a culinary gem, has recently undergone a revitalizing transformation, courtesy of the branding and visual identity experts at Feitoria. This vibrant rebranding endeavor, guided by the principles of irreverence and refinement, has breathed new life into the Forneria, amplifying its appeal and fortifying its presence in the bustling food scene.
The refreshed identity retains the core essence of Italian culinary tradition while infusing it with a playful, contemporary edge. A clever play on words, the new tagline ""forneria"" is not just a nod to the establishment's name but also a strategic move to streamline online searchability and social media engagement.
The heart of this rebranding is the new logo, a typographic marvel that embodies the brand's personality. The ligatures, mimicking the stringy cheese of a pizza or a hearty pasta dish, are a subtle yet powerful visual metaphor that speaks volumes about the authentic Italian dining experience Cappi Forneria offers.
Complementing the logo is a carefully curated color palette, inspired by the rich hues of Italian cuisine. This palette, combined with a blend of classic and informal typography, creates a visual symphony that resonates with both tradition and modernity.
The visual identity extends beyond the logo and color palette. A series of unique signatures, designed for seamless integration across all brand touchpoints, have been developed. These signatures not only enhance brand recognition but also open up exciting possibilities for future merchandise, paving the way for Cappi Forneria's foray into the lifestyle market.
Adding a touch of whimsy to the brand's visual language are exclusive illustrations by Guilherme Santana. These illustrations, depicting the joy and lightness of savoring Italian cuisine, infuse the brand with a playful personality. The versatility of these illustrations allows for the creation of dynamic compositions, further enriching the brand's visual communication.
Cappi Forneria's revamped branding is a testament to the power of thoughtful design in elevating a brand's identity. By artfully blending tradition with a modern, irreverent spirit, Feitoria has crafted a visual identity that is both timeless and refreshingly contemporary.

Last weekend, the Premier League took the weekend off for the FA Cup. This weekend, the Premier League returns with a stacked lineup of games. One match to watch is the contest between Manchester City and Newcastle at Etihad Stadium. For the first time in what feels like forever, Manchester City is not at the top of the standings. In fact, City enters the weekend in fifth place. Which team is right behind City in the standings? That would be Newcastle with the same amount of points.
It’s been an eventful week for Manchester City. On February 11, City faced Real Madrid in the UEFA Champions League playoff. Despite having leads of 1-0 and 2-1, City blew the game and lost 3-2. City will also be without Manuel Akanji for the foreseeable future. Could this be the opening Newcastle needs to snap their 20-league-game losing streak at Manchester City? Newcastle’s last win at Manchester City came in 2000.

Dante's Peak releases on 4K Blu-ray on April 22, and you can save on your preorder at Amazon.
By 
    Jon Bitner
   on February 14, 2025 at 12:03PM PST
 Dante’s Peak on 4K Blu-ray 
 $31.49 (was $45) | Releases April 22 
 
Dante’s Peak hit theaters in 1997, and now, nearly 30 years later, it’s getting a 4K Blu-ray release. The Pierce Brosnan-led disaster film is available to preorder on 4K at Amazon ahead of its April 22 launch. While the film didn’t earn the best reviews, it featured solid performances from Brosnan--who was James Bond at the time--and Linda Hamilton. Dante's Peak's special effects were quite impressive for the late '90s, too.
If you’re interested in seeing how the effects look in 4K, consider reserving a copy today. We’ve already seen it go out of stock at Walmart, so it's possible Amazon could sell out of preorders ahead of release, too.
Preordering at Amazon locks in its preorder price guarantee--so if the 4K Blu-ray edition is discounted between now and April 22, you’ll pay the lower price. The film is already discounted to $31.49 (was $45), making this a good time to preorder. You also won’t be charged until it ships.
This upcoming release includes both 4K and standard Blu-ray versions of the film. The 4K version is a scan from the 35mm original camera negative and supports HDR, so it should be one of the best ways to experience Dante’s Peak on modern TVs. 
There aren’t too many bonus features in this version of Dante’s Peak, but you’ll find a few across its two discs. Here’s a complete look at what’s included--note that some are offered in 4K while others are standard Blu-ray.
If you don’t need the 4K version of the film, you’ll find the standard Blu-ray of Dante’s Peak available for $10 (was $15). It features all the same bonus content as this upcoming version, so give it a look if you want to save a few bucks. You could also consider The Pierce Brosnan Collection, which pulls together four James Bond films--GoldenEye, Tomorrow Never Dies, The World Is Not Enough, and Die Another Day.
Dante’s Peak is set in a Northwest town of the same name, where a dormant volcano is about to erupt. Brosnan plays a volcanologist who must help evacuate the town before it’s too late, and what follows is a dramatic natural disaster film with special effects ahead of its time. Brosnan shared the screen with Linda Hamilton (The Terminator, T2: Judgement Day), and the film was directed by Roger Donaldson (No Way Out, Species).
