Worried about tariffs hurting your stock portfolio? There's an easy fix, Morgan Stanley says: Just lean away from industries that rely on importing goods.

        In a client note on Monday morning, Mike Wilson, the bank's chief investment officer and top US equity strategist, said that his team is partial to services-oriented areas of the market.
    

        ""Tariffs reinforce our preference for services industries,"" Wilson wrote, adding, ""We would expect the market to rotate further toward services given recent trade policy implementation.""
    

        Wilson highlighted four services sectors he's particularly bullish on: software, financials, consumerservices, and mediaandentertainment.
    

        The comments came as US stock indexes plummeted on Monday after President Trump's tariffs went into effect over the weekend. Trump initially announced 25% tariffs on all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, and 10% tariffs on goods from China. But Trump temporarily paused his tariffs on Mexico on Monday when the country said it would send 10,000 troops to its border with the US to help slow illegal crossings. A similar pause was reached with Canada. Trump has also threatened to impose tariffs on the European Union going forward.
    

        But Wilson's favoring of services stocks goes beyond tariffs. He said services industries would see the largest efficiency increases thanks to AI, something that is already showing up in performance. The median stock among AI adopters in the services industries is up 2024 over the last 13 months, compared to 9% for the median S&P 500 stock. Even including non-AI adopters, the median services industries stock is up 17%, he said.
    

        ""This structural tailwind strengthens the case for favoring services industries beyond the cyclical drivers that are supporting these pockets of the market (stronger pricing power, stronger earnings revisions and more limited tariff headwinds),"" Wilson wrote.
    

        One further recent positive catalyst for AI adopters is DeepSeek's R1 chatbot, which came out in late January. 
    

        ""Optimizing GenAI models is not a new phenomenon, but what this news cycle appeared to do is turn investors' focus toward the idea that cheaper models are likely to increase adoption and drive efficiencies,"" Wilson wrote. ""Further, it drew market participants' attention to the significant value in the application layer.""
    

        Software and media and entertainment are particularly well-positioned to reap the benefits of AI adoption, he said.
    

        Exchange-traded funds are one way to gain diversified exposure to the above areas of the market. Examples of funds that offer relevant exposure include: the SPDR S&P Software & Services ETF (XSW), the Vanguard Financials Index Fund ETF (VFH), the iShares Evolved US Media and Entertainment ETF (IEME), and the iShares US Consumer Discretionary ETF (IYC).

1,2025-02-04,"Robinhood has ceased the rollout of its sports betting product following a request by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The stock trading company geared at individual investors had been jumping headfirst into sports betting with its Pro Football Championship market, looking to capitalize on the rapidly growing demand for pure degeneracy.
It was only a few years ago that Robinhoodâwhich was central in the pandemic-era memestock frenzyâfaced substantial criticism from legislators and the public alike over concerns that its sleek app encouraged short-term investing with features like notifications that alerted users to stock price fluctuations and confetti that covered the app whenever users placed a trade. The company has made some changes to its product in the intervening years, and introduced products like a retirement IRA and credit card.
Most financial experts advise individuals, sometimes referred to as “retail investors,” to invest with a long-term mindset by purchasing index funds that track the stock market and allow them to appreciate over the years. Individuals typically do not make money day trading individual stocks, whereas the U.S. stock market has consistently appreciated in value over recent decades, making it a largely safe bet to invest in a basket of stocks that reflects the entire market.
The ironic thing about Robinhood’s foray into sports betting is that retail investors have long been stigmatized as inexperienced novices simply gambling away their money, trading on vibes rather than fundamental conviction. Robinhood was not doing them any justice by inserting an actual gambling product into its app.
“While we continue to work with the CFTC to understand their concerns, we are suspending the rollout of the Pro Football Championship market,” Robinhood said in a statement on its blog. “We have rolled this product out to roughly 1% of our customers, and for those who already placed trades, we plan on providing the option to close their positions or take them to resolution.” The CFTC warned Robinhood the product might be illegal under current statutes around offering options contracts, in this case for gaming outcomes. The company, for its part, has essentially argued for a laissez faire approach: Gaming bets should be allowed because the market has shown demand for them. Perhaps President Trump will step in and help Robinhood move forward with the product.
As sports betting has quickly become legalized throughout several states thanks to a 2018 Supreme Court ruling, companies like DraftKings have been able to rake in billions of dollars from individuals looking to make a quick dollar by placing small bets on the outcomes of games. While the public was generally supportive of allowing sports betting initiallyâit was happening underground, and therefore legalizing it made some senseâsentiment has started to turn in online communities. On X, many people have begun to deride sports betting, saying it has ruined the carefree joy of sports entertainment as people put their own money on the line, making for a tense atmosphere and heated emotions when bets go sideways.
Exact numbers are hard to come by, but the U.S. sports betting market was estimated to bring in $14 billion in 2024, up from $11 billion the prior year. The games, as with all gambling, are rigged in favor of the house.
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has formally requested that Robinhood Derivatives, LLC (RHD) ânot permit customers to accessâ sports event contracts.
While we continue to work with the CFTC to understand their concerns, we are suspending the rollout of the Proâ¦

Some dark stories have only added to concerns about online sports betting. The Athletic last year published a story about a veteran who gambled away his life after becoming addicted to sports betting and finding himself digging a progressively deeper hole as he tried in vain to win back his losses. Exotic bets like parlays offer tantalizing potential jackpots but are incredibly complex and hard to win, only encouraging even more reckless behavior; companies like DraftKings draw players back to their apps with offers of free money to place on new bets. The whole story could have been ripped straight from “Uncut Gems.”
The idea that Robinhood would place a person’s investment portfolio, essentially their nest egg, next to the roulette table feels unwise, especially considering the addictive nature of the activity. Hopefully, if Robinhood does proceed with a rollout of its betting markets, it will think about designing it thoughtfully. Many critics think, however, that it simply should not be legal to gamble anywhere from the convenience of one’s smartphone.
Of course, some of this comes down to personal responsibility, but Robinhood should also take care to thoughtfully design its app so users are protected from harming themselves. The company settled in 2021 with a family whose son died by suicide after he mistakenly believed his account balance was negative $730,000 after trading options and being unable to reach Robinhood support regarding the issue. The parents said Robinhood was at fault for luring inexperienced investors to take big risks in sophisticated financial instruments without providing the necessary customer support and investment guidance.

2,2025-02-04,"The Chinese government announced Tuesday it is opening an investigation into Google in response to 10 percent tariffs imposed on Chinese imports by US president Donald Trump. Minutes after the tariffs went into effect, China’s State Administration for Market Regulation said it was probing the American tech giant for potentially violating the country’s anti-monopoly law.
The Chinese government may have strategically chosen to go after Google because it has limited operations in the country, ensuring the hit to the US tech giant would be relatively minimal. The move gives China plenty of room to escalate if the Trump administration announces further tariffs or other trade measures. Google declined to comment.
China also announced it was putting more restrictions on the sale of some critical minerals like tungsten and slapping additional tariffs on farm equipment, pickup trucks, liquified natural gas, coal, and other goods from the US. While the US isn’t reliant on China for all of the impacted minerals, the country does control the majority of the world’s tungsten supply, which is used in light bulbs, semiconductors, and ammunition.
“China’s position is firm and consistent. Trade and tariff wars have no winners,” China’s Ministry of Foreign affairs said in a statement Sunday shortly after the tariffs were announced. “This move cannot solve the US’s problems at home and, more importantly, does not benefit either side, still less the world.”
China has kept Google in its crosshairs during the ongoing trade war with the US over the last few years. In 2020, the government reportedly considered opening an antitrust investigation into Google's Android business, according to Reuters. The deliberations followed a complaint from Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, which was targeted by Trump during his first term.
Because of US sanctions, Huawei is unable to use American-made software like Google Mobile Services, a suite of tools widely used across the smartphone industry. The restrictions forced the company to develop its own operating system called Harmony OS.
But most smartphones around the world still run on Android, which has sparked competition investigations in a number of countries, some of which have led to concessionary changes designed to give consumers and app developers more choices and lower fees. In China, several smartphone makers continue to rely on an open source version of Android.
This past December, Chinese authorities also opened an anti-monopoly investigation into Nvidia, the chipmaker whose GPUs play a crucial role in the development of generative AI and have become a significant source of trade sparring between the US and China. The announcement came soon after the Biden administration further tightened China’s access to high-end semiconductors.
About 15 years ago, Google stopped offering a search experience tailored for China following a series of Chinese government-linked cyberattacks against it and other US companies. Google debated reentering China with a search engine about seven years ago, but the project was scuttled following protests from some employees concerned about supporting Chinese surveillance and censorship.
Google has also stopped short of directly selling cloud technologies in China, as local laws could threaten the privacy and security assurances it offers to customers in other markets. Other Google services such as YouTube are blocked by Chinese internet regulators.
China has allowed domestic companies to buy advertisements through Google so that they can market to customers abroad. But the revenue from those deals is relatively small, and China didn't even garner a mention in parent company Alphabet's annual financial report last year. That stands in contrast to Meta, which lists China among its biggest markets in terms of advertiser location and said last year that China-based advertisers account for 10 percent of its annual revenue.

3,2025-02-04,"Business Insider Edition 
Jack Schwager is adding another installment to his popular ""Market Wizards"" collection, the author told Business Insider.

        Schwager's sixth ""Market Wizards"" book will likely be published in the second half of 2026, he said. He is co-writing the latest edition with financial writer and researcher George Coyle.
    

        The focus will be on the early parts of top traders' careers, he said, and the working title is ""Market Wizards: Origins."" He has just begun to do the interviews, though the subjects of the latest books are mostly set, he said.
    

        ""It will be a mix of well-known names and those who are completely unknown, but have done spectacularly well,"" he said.
    

        His series, which began with 1989's ""Market Wizards: Interviews with Top Traders,"" is an account of the winning investment strategies of big names like billionaire Paul Tudor Jones and under-the-radar day traders who have made large personal fortunes. The series has sold ""well over a million copies,"" according to a press release from a decade ago and before the publication of the fifth book in the series.
    

        An investor himself, Schwager has worked with different investment managers over the years, including as a partner at London-based fund-of-funds Fortune Asset Management, which was bought by Close Brothers Asset Management in 2006. Before he wrote the first of the ""Market Wizards"" series, he wrote ""A Complete Guide to the Futures Markets"" in 1984 and has since revised and updated the reference work several times.
    

        His ""Market Wizards"" books are primarily interviews with the subject, and the original included 17 traders featured. This time around, he plans to do 12 interviews, including with some subjects who have been featured before.
    

        The big difference he has found in researching and vetting potential subjects now compared with decades ago is the desire for under-the-radar stars to remain anonymous.
    

        ""Some people feel a sense of modesty that's somewhat misplaced,"" he said. He said he tells the individuals to ""let me be the judge"" of whether or not they're worthy of inclusion.
    

        Still, he anticipates this will be the first book where some subjects remain anonymous.
    

        ""Their story is what counts,"" he says, and as long as he can verify the numbers via brokerage statements, he is comfortable not naming them.
    

        ""They feel they owe something, but they want to remain anonymous,"" he said.

China has announced export restrictions on key raw materials as well. Rather than screw themselves Trump-style by wrecking their lucrative manufacturing services industry, they are making American companies even more reliant on them because domestic manufacturers will have to pay top dollar for the materials they need.
When you look at the detail it's pretty clear that China has been planning this carefully for a long time. They even made it very clear what they would do back in Trump's first term, when they

And with no user focused services, it's not selling ads that target china - it's allowing chinese companies to advertise to foreigners.All this would do is reduce the ability of chinese companies to advertise their services to foreign audiences.
Most Chinese phones use Android, although Huawei has their own OS that they are licencing now. The sanctions spurred innovation.
If they decide that Android is too much of a monopoly they might rule that the licencing terms are too onerous and thus invalid, meaning Chinese companies are free to make Android devices that don't include Google apps or have Google as the default search engine, for the export market. That would be a huge blow because there are several big markets, such as India, where it could re 
I'm talking about export models.
Wouldn't it be hilarious if everyone including Google assumes they mean Chinese anti-trust laws... and then China turns over everything they've found on how Google is violating EU and US anti-trust laws to relevant prosecutors in those jurisdictions?
Most people are still dumb though, so traveling Americans are still getting yelled at by people who blame them who assume they support insanity.
One problem with running such a huge trade surplus with a foreign country is that you can't really hurt them by refusing to buy their goods and services.
This makes them different from the US in what way?
Actually, historically China has usually been so isolationist that they barely acknowledged that other countries existed, but, yeah, when they did they played power politics.  Which is why we should have supported VietNam rather than fighting there.

Wake me up when Google search isn't banned in that country.

Amazon is, and has always been, a mail order house. The only real focus of a mail order house is cutting costs, and Amazon does that well.
Brick & mortar retail is sometimes about cheap prices - The Orange Suck is the master of it - but is often about customer service, even if it costs more.
Amazon's entirely business philosophy is the exact opposite of what most people want from a brick & mortar store.
I wish them all the world's misery, and that they never figure it out.
 Amazon is, and has always been, a mail order house that makes little profit.Amazon's online business is not that profitable with their services keeping the company afloat. They can afford to drive everyone out of business in the online market with lower operating costs and low margins. When it comes to brick and mortar, there is much more operating costs which means they are probably losing a lot of money.

My experience of trying out Amazon Fresh was:Price and range of products was about the same as Tesco Express, who are the market leader in my country. The buying experience was much worse. So in future, if I see an Amazon Fresh and Tesco Express nearby, and all of them are near Tesco Expresses, I choose Tesco.
  Brick & mortar retail is sometimes about cheap prices 
I don't think so.  Maybe I'm unique, but  I only go to Brick and Mortar for things that great customer service isn't really what it is about.   Price and the speed of getting the desired things and checking out are priorities.

 Brick & mortar retail is sometimes about cheap prices I don't think so.You have an extra word at the end there.People do not go to Home Depot for customer service, they go there for price (and damned little else). People do not go to Walmart for customer service, they go there for price. Those are both the biggest retailers in their market (Walmart being the biggest retailer period, even over Amazon).Your experience does not define the entire market. Or even the biggest part of it.

  Jokes a side I can well understand why Amazon struggles with physical stores. 
Traditional physical stores is a completely different operation from being an online retailer,  and I suspect Amazon does not actually want any part of that,  unless they can do physical stores in a radically different and more efficient way.

I thought best buy already served as Amazon's showroom ?
But they should be able to sell Mortars in the Middle East and Ukraine
Mortars sell better if they include the pestles too.
So the answer was drive-thru? A drive-thru store? So crazy it just might work!
Albertson's/Vons/Safeway has that in it's Drive up and Go program. You order online and you can pay to have it doordashed to you or you can drive up to a designated spot and say your are here and we bring your stuff out with or without bags (your choice).

Amazon isn't trying to make physical stores work for it, it's just trying to create a new type of physical store and see if that works.
And as far as I'm aware, Whole Foods, its more traditional B&M store, is actually doing fine right now.
If Amazon simply wanted to do physical stores as a general thing (outside of Whole Foods), they'd do physical stores. They could compete directly with Walmart. They're choosing not to right now, just experimenting with some tech ideas to see if they work. Maybe they're planning something in the future, who knows?

Dude, don't suggest enshitifying Target. It's the only real alternative we have left to Walmart around here, and I specifically pay them a few pennies more per item to *NOT BE WALMART*. If Amazon took them over, they'd go right to the cost-cutting routine and send them into the same murky, can't be bothered to bathe or wear real clothes customer base that Walmart tends to draw.
Target would probably be worse under Amazon's leadership, but still not quite as bad as Walmart.  The second Walmart felt the political winds changing, they nixed DEI and I also noticed this year that there's no LGBTQ+ Valentine's Day cards in store.
Of course, the removal of DEI was really just paying lip service to the right wing, so they wouldn't boycott the stores (as if most of that demographic has anywhere else to shop anyway).  Walmart still continues to practices its own version of DEI, being willing

 Amazon isn't trying to make physical stores work for it, it's just trying to create a new type of physical store and see if that works.That is like saying if Tesla made gasoline powered cars that they were not ""trying to make IC cars work but a new type of IC car"". It sounds like excuses more than anything else. Amazon’s strategy seems to be the only company in the market. They dominate the online space and looking to push everyone out of the brick and mortar business. They currently have the money to take losses for years to gain market share.

And as far as I'm aware, Whole Foods, its more traditional B&M store, is actually doing fine right now.Of course, it's worth pointing out that Amazon bought Whole Foods.  Pretty much all they had to do was stay out of the way and let the people who already ran it keep doing their jobs, and it would be doing fine.That's a bit different from starting a retail business from scratch.

Maybe it's different because I'm in Toronto (over 9M people if you include bedroom communities), but I continue to be flabbergasted at what appears to be the near total lack of integration between Whole Foods and Amazon's gigantic e-commerce platform.

Amazon only said they had AI powering their Just Walk Out.
They never said it was Artificial Intelligence so when it turned out to be Actually Indians there was only muted condemnation.

So their profits fell below sustainability.

A simpler way to solve it is by doing what Walmart does: Require an RFID tag in every package.  Then design an RFID scanner that can scan your entire cart at once.  The only thing it won't work for is fresh produce, and even that could theoretically be solved if they *really* wanted to, with the exception of fruit sold by the pound.
Fresh produce could simply be pre bagged in half or full pound increments. If you want 5 lbs of apples then buy 5 1lb bags.Except that a lot of folks want to buy... say three bananas, or one tomato, not half a pound of tomatoes.  And putting single items into plastic bags will have the anti-plastic police up in arms.  The right solution would be a thin RFID tag that's on the underside of a food-safe sticker.  This is not necessarily easy to pull off, though. :-)

The major 'feature' of the Amazon store is that it was member-only, you had to be a Prime member to open the entry gates. Not so.  You had to be a Prime member to use ""Just Walk Out.""  But you could shop there without being a Prime member.  You just had to go through the checkout.

Should have started with Hot Topic / Spirit Halloween style stores.
Whole Foods is doing well enough.  Amazon can do a working store if they did it the traditional way.  Not Just Walk Out, but just a traditional store.
We don't need another Temu or Shein.  We need stores that have decent customer service, even if it might cost 1-2 percent more on products.
The market desperately needs something like an old school Sears.  Something that sells decent, easily repairable appliances, where even the cheapest item is not bad.  The ability to walk in and pick something up and know it 
... and that's a problem for Amazon.
From a customer viewpoint, the nice thing about Brick and Mortar is that they are heavily regulated, easily sued, and easily tracked down. They simply cannot succeed in business if they happen to stock low quality or counterfeit merchandise. This gives the customer some confidence that they probably aren't going to be completely ripped off.
But Amazon's profitability specifically depends on avoiding these same niceties. They do this by only taking responsibility as the ""mi

Sitting at your desk all day is literally a pain. It’s bad for your mental and physical health and slowly turns you into a hunched-over keyboard gargoyle. You could take walking breaks away from your screen, but even then, you’re still spending a lot of the day on your butt.
Enter: the walking pad. These tiny treadmills fit under standing desks and allow you to rack up steps while you work. It might sound far-fetched, but yes, you can exercise and be productive on your computer at the same time. In fact, I’m convinced these things actually make me more efficient. They keep my energy up, and I’m more locked in. Working from home is exponentially better with my little office hamster wheel.
There are tons of walking pads on the market, with varying speed capabilities, extra features like built-in desk platforms, and durability. We tested the ones below to help you narrow down your search to the best of the best. Are you trying to get more fit in 2025? Don’t forget to check out our picks for the Best Treadmills, Best Fitness Trackers, and Best Running Shoes.

Obviously, budget is a major factor. Outside of that, here’s what you’ll want to consider as you pick out a pad.
Space constraints: Walking pads are typically much smaller than full-blown running treadmills, but most home office areas aren’t exactly sprawling, either. Make sure the footprint will work for you, or consider a foldable option. If you’re planning to store the thing when you’re not using it, make sure it can fit under the bed or couch in your room.
Weight capacity: Walking pads aren’t as heavy, as strong, or as durable as treadmills, and that means they tend to have a lower weight capacity. Make sure the one you’re interested in will work for you and anyone else who will be using it. Typically, a higher weight capacity means it should hold up longer in general. Per the reviews I've read, walking pads are notorious for falling apart after only a few months or a few years of use, so it might be worth getting something that’s a little more heavy-duty.
Tracking your metrics: Most walking pads have some kind of display on them that shows you the steps and mileage you’re tallying, but many don’t keep that count going if you step off and get back on later. Most also have an app, which can sometimes sync your metrics from the machine so you can check them from your phone. If tracking is important to you, you’ll probably want that option. Otherwise, make sure you’re wearing a fitness tracker.
Extra features: Some walking pads have an incline, a speed range that allows you to run on them, and built-in desks. Some allow you to set the pace with a remote or quicken or slow your steps to automatically adjust the speed. Consider how you’d like to use the walking pad most often and then look for options that can meet those needs.

This little guy is a top pick on Reddit, and I can see why! It’s incredibly lightweight and easy to set up, the deck feels comfortable underfoot and has good energy return, it has a good weight capacity for a walking pad, and it’s very affordable. The remote connectivity is solid, and the app (called Sperax Fitness) syncs easily with the machine. These things might seem basic, but after testing some other walking pads with wonky functionality, it was a refreshing change.
It was easy to assemble; I had it out of the box and up and running in a matter of minutes. It also has a vibration mode; I’m not really sure what this does, but I guess getting a full body shake feels good. It’s also only 3.5 inches tall, so you can easily slide it under a couch or prop it against a wall in a closet. Since it’s on the shorter side (39 inches), I thought I might feel like I was going to fall off, but I didn’t have to shorten my strides at all. (If you’re tall, this might be a problem for you.) Even though I have a few walking pads to choose from, I want to keep using this one.
However, this pad is quite noisy. There’s a significant whirring every few minutes—I thought it was a leaf blower in the distance at first. The display on the machine is tiny, and your step count starts over if you take a break. The machine doesn’t turn off right away if you step off, like some others, which could be a safety issue.
I don’t like the app; it doesn’t log your steps from the machine. The app has workouts where you can walk in different parts of the world, and those steps are logged, but you have to have the app open with the workout video playing on your phone, which is annoying. The machine is also so light (27 pounds!) that I am a bit worried about its durability. I hope it holds up, because I like this one a lot!

This is a much longer and heavier walking pad; it’s 57 inches (32.5 inches when folded), which means it’s a good choice for taller folks or anyone who has a long stride. The deck feels good, though not as springy or as padded as the Sperax. This machine was a bit of a pain to set up. Getting the Bluetooth remote and app (called KS Fit) to connect with the pad was a struggle, initially. I also didn’t like that when you first start using the machine you have to spend time walking at slower speeds before you can “unlock” the upper end of the range.
I like the level of control and the tracking capabilities of this device more than the Sperax, though. You can adjust the speed via either the remote or the app, and you can use the pad without the app. You can check your time, speed, distance, calories, and steps on the large display. The app is a little wonky—if you don’t start a workout with the app, your progress won’t be tracked or logged, and it doesn’t sync later. It also saves each walking session separately, so if you take a break, you start from zero again, but you can see your daily steps on KS Fit if you do a little digging (that is, if you’ve been using it with the app).
There are also workouts in the app, which, whatever, since I like to use the machine in manual mode, which means it doesn’t change based on my pace. Automatic mode uses sensors under the belt to adjust the speed to your pace. It felt awkward, since I couldn’t figure out how to slow the pace without the device totally stopping. You switch between modes with the app or the display and can stop and start the machine using the app or remote. I tend to use the app more than the remote, because the remote connectivity is inconsistent.
The machine feels like it will be durable and last a long time. Its heft makes it harder to move around than the Sperax, and while the folding capability is a win in general, if you plan to slide this under something, make sure the folded height (5.4 inches) will work.

The EgoFit is about the same length and width as the Sperax but taller, thanks to its fixed 5 percent incline. It will make your walking a bit more of a workout but may pose some storage issues. It has similar app and tracking capabilities to the WalkingPad C2. When former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano reviewed the EgoFit, she noted that both the remote and app (called FitShow) controlled the machine well, but only the app preserved her step data.
A screen on the front of the machine cycles through time, calories burned, distance walked, steps, and walking speed, and if you step off the pad for a break, those numbers will go back to zero. The app will save each session, but you need to use it to control the treadmill for it to start tracking; it won't automatically sync later if you use the remote. The app also zeroes out if you pause your walking, so you’ll have to add up your sessions to get your daily step count.
Giordano appreciated how quiet and lightweight the EgoFit was, saying it was easy to move around her home to use in different places. It helped her increase her daily step count from a few hundred to an impressive 14,000 or more.
“For me, gyms are a nightmare. I don't want to carve out the time to drive there or have to look presentable when I'm exercising. With the Egofit, I can walk for as long or as little as I want, knowing I can do more later,” Giordano wrote. “I can walk for 20 minutes, make lunch, walk for 10, go snuggle the cats, and then do a night session while I binge Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders: Making the Team. You can't do that with a gym membership.”

8,2025-02-04,"A telehealth company that New York City paid $26 million to provide free online therapy to teens was leaking data about who visited the website to TikTok, Meta, Snap, and other social media companies that the city is currently suing for harming teen mental health, according to a coalition of privacy advocates.
In a series of letters sent to New York City officials, the Parent Coalition for Student Privacy, AI for Families, and the New York Civil Liberties Union say they identified a wide array of online tracking pixels on the special landing page for NYC Teenspace, a service built by Talkspace. Pixels are snippets of code that collect information about who visits a website so that platforms can retarget people with content and advertisements related to their web browsing.
âThereâs a particular type of exploitation that comes when any of us, but particularly kids, search for sensitive issues online,â said Shannon Edwards, a New York City parent, digital marketing consultant, and founder of AI for Families. âUnder the guise of a service that a provider is intending to be beneficial, a simple search can be something that follows you around on social media or television.â
In a December letter responding to the groupsâ concerns, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene wrote that at its request âTalkspace removed all trackers and cookies from the Teenspace programâs website.â The company’s chief privacy officer, Mary Potter, told Gizmodo that it’s also developing a new privacy policy and intake flow for its teen-focused services that will go into effect in the next few weeks.
When Gizmodo tested the NYC Teenspace landing page on January 24, there were no advertising pixels on the page. But similar teen therapy landing pages that Talkspace built for the cities of Seattle and Baltimore still had an array of trackers that sent information about who visited the sites to TikTok, Meta, Snapchat, Google, X (formerly Twitter), Reddit, LinkedIn, Spotify, Quora, and several companies that facilitate targeted advertisements on television and podcasts. Those pixels were removed after Gizmodo contacted Talkspace.
Potter said the pixels sent website visitors’ IP addresses to social media companies and advertising firms but did not transmit any personal medical information.
IP addresses can be used to identify a particular computer or phone and are commonly used to target advertisements.
“Teens spend a large amount of their time, energy and focus on social media sites,” Potter said. “As such, these are the locations where teens can learn about the mental health services that are now newly available to help them. It is unfortunate that [removing the pixels] will negatively impact the ability to reach out to teenagers in hard-to-reach neighborhoods; but we understand and will work with our City partners to make up for this limitation using other grassroots methods.”
More than 21,000 teens have used the NYC Teenspace service since its launch, she said.
Rachel Vick, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene said the cityâs contract with Talkspace âprohibits the use of user data for purposes other than to provide mental health services to teensâ but she did not directly answer a question about whether Talkspaceâs use of advertising pixels on the NYC Teenspace landing page violated that contract.
The Seattle Department of Education and Early Learning âwas not previously aware of the presence of any tracking tools on the Seattle landing page and are actively looking into this issue,â Jonah Spangenthal-Lee, a spokesperson for the department, told Gizmodo.
In February 2024, New York City sued TikTok, Meta, Snapchat, and Youtube alleging that the companiesâ deliberately addictive platforms contributed to a mental health crisis among the cityâs youth.
In a section describing Metaâs practices, the cityâs attorneys wrote that âcomprehensive data collection allows it to target and influence its users to engineer their protracted âengagementâ â¦ Many of these data segments are collected by Meta through surveillance of each userâs activity on the platform and off the platform, including behavioral surveillance that users are not even aware of.â
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has warned healthcare providers against installing tracking pixels on their websites that may share sensitive data about patients with third parties. And in 2023, the Federal Trade Commission fined BetterHelp, another online therapy provider, for sharing patient data with social media companies via tracking pixels on its intake survey forms.
A number of other telehealth companies, including Talkspace, are currently facing class action lawsuits alleging that their use of third-party tracking tools violates state privacy laws.
While patients may assume that their actions on a telehealth website are protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), many telehealth companies operate in a legal grey area. HIPAA-covered entities are prohibited from sharing personally identifiable medical information about patients with third parties, but some telehealth firms claim that the same information is fair game to share if a person enters it into a form on the companyâs websiteâwhich is often operated by a subsidiary that isnât covered by HIPAAâbefore the person officially becomes a patient.
Teens visiting the NYC Teenspace website used to go through a questionnaire that required them to input their address, age, and gender, among other information before they officially signed up, but Talkspace removed many of those questions from the site after the New York parent groups raised their privacy concerns with the cityâs Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.
âIf Talkspace is really interested in privacy, why do they throw that survey up at the very beginning of the process before teens have even signed up to be clients?â said Leonie Haimson, co-chair of the Parent Coalition for Student Privacy.
Potter told Gizmodo that the information teens entered into that initial questionnaire was used to match patients with therapists and not for targeted advertising.
In investor presentations, Talkspace CEO Jon Cohen has emphasized the companyâs efforts to target the teen market. During a January 2024 presentation, he pointed to the contracts the company had recently signed to provide therapy to New York City and Baltimore teens as an example of Talkspace âleaning inâ to the teen vertical, which he estimated to be âconservatively approximately a $500 million market.â
During another presentation earlier this year, Cohen unveiled the latest fruits of Talkspaceâs data collection efforts: A forthcoming generative AI tool that ingests patientsâ conversations with their therapists and then creates a âpersonalized podcastâ for the patient.
The tool was trained using what Cohen described as âthe largest mental health data banks, certainly in the U.S., if not the world,â including 10 billion proprietary clinical data points, 140 million messages, 6.2 million assessments, 1.2 million diagnoses, and 4.3 million psych notes, among other data.
Potter told Gizmodo âNo data was collected from any teen program in the initial testing of this product and no data will be collected from any teen program in its eventual development.”
Cohenâs introduction of the AI podcast generator, however, focused on teens. During the presentation, he played a sample podcast created for a fictitious 14-year-old named Emma. The fake podcaster introduces itself and says âWelcome, Emma, to your personalized podcast Talkspace episode. At Talkspace, weâve built a vast dataset from thousands of teens just like you.â

The effects of the climate crisis will erase $1.47 trillion in home values across the US by 2055, a new study from the research firm First Street found.

        Those losses will not be spread equally across the country. In some areas, home price gains may be able to outpace losses, but some places will be harder hit.
    

        First Street estimated that 40% of property-value losses will be concentrated in places it calls ""climate abandonment"" communities. In these locations — primarily in California's Central Valley, at risk of wildfire, and coastal New Jersey, at risk of flood and wind damage — a combination of population decline and rising insurance premiums are predicted to drive down home values.
    

        First Street found that 21,750 neighborhoods spread across the US, or 26% of current US Census tracts, qualify as what it calls ""climate abandonment"" communities.
    

        Recent extreme weather events highlight the staggering cost of natural disasters fueled and worsenedby the climate crisis. Last year, back-to-back hurricanes Milton and Helene devastated parts of Florida and the Southeast, with Milton alone causing up to an estimated $28 billion in insured losses. Recent Los Angeles wildfires are expected to total close to $250 billion in total damages.
    

        Over the next several decades, First Street's researcherspredict more extreme weather events will recalibrate the places Americans find safe to call home. When the population dwindles for any reason, home prices are likely to fall due to a lack of demand.
    

        Consider the way Hurricane Sandy affected the Jersey Shore. Many lower-income residents of New Jersey living along the Atlantic coast were unable to rebuild in those areas due to the soaring cost of flood insurance. Amanda Devecka-Rinear founded the New Jersey Organizing Project, a nonprofit to improve disaster recovery funding, after driving around Long Beach Island, located in Ocean County, and seeing rows of abandoned houses.
    

        ""People just got pushed out or had to walk away or had to sell their places because they could never cobble together the funding to get back,"" Devecka-Rinear told Business Insider in 2022.
    

        Below are Ocean County and four other communities First Street highlighted for their risk of ""climate abandonment"" and, therefore, property value declines. The percentages for each county are forecasts from First Street from 2025 to the year 2055.

12,2025-02-04,"Ethanol maker and food processor says 2025 guidance reflects ‘weaker’ market view on biofuel, trade policy turmoil"
13,2025-02-04,"Business Insider Edition 
Canadian charter airline Nolinor Aviation has agreed to buy an all-new aircraft type known as a ""blended-wing body"" as it expands beyond its all-Boeing fleet.

        The futuristic cargo plane ""Kona"" is being developed by California-based startup Natlius. Its design combines the fuselage and wings into one section that the company says can reduce fuel consumption by 30%.
    

        Smaller than some other cargo-specific planes in service today, Kona would complement Nolinor's fleet of larger Boeing 737-200 freighters when it enters service after 2028, all of which are at least 40 years old, President Marco Prud'Homme told Business Insider. 
    

        ""It'll be like opening a new horizon for us, and we can fly to more places that we couldn't in the past,"" Prud'Homme said. ""For example, the 737-200 would be too much capacity for some communities, but a weekly flight with Kona would be perfect.""
    

        He pointed to its 50% lower operating costs compared to similar plane types and its ability to reach more remote places, land on unpaved terrain, and carry more bulky cargo than competing planes.
    

        Nolinor's main business is flying for mining companies in Northern Canada, including carrying passengers and cargo to various sites. Prud'Homme said the airline flies five or six times a day up north.
    

        There is little infrastructure in these areas, meaning most of the runways are gravel, grass, ice, or dirt. Nolinor has historically relied on its aging 737-200 aircraft to reach these places, thanks to a special kit that can be equipped on the jetliner.
    

        Newer 737 models do not have this ability — greatly limiting Nolinor's fleet options. However, Natlius' Kona aircraft is being designed to tackle the job.
    

        Natilus CEO Aleksey Matyushev told BI that Kona's field performance is focused on gravel, dirt, and grass, but it would likely not be ice-capable.
    

        He added that the carbon-fiber fuselage would have a special coating to protect it from gravel or other terrain being kicked up, and the propellers would be optimally located away from much debris.
    

        While competing propeller aircraft, like the De Havilland Canada Otter or the Pilatus PC-12, can also land on unpaved runways, Prud'Homme said Kona's engine placement was a major selling point.
    

        ""It's a very costly operation,"" he said. ""When we saw their design has the engines mounted at the back of the aircraft, and basically the aircraft becomes the protection for the engines, we saw that this was a great potential for us.""
    

        Kona would carry about 8,500 pounds of cargo — far less than the nearly 30,000-pound carrying capability of Nolinor's 737-200.
    

        However, Prud'Homme said the smaller Kona's 900-nautical-mile range and nearly 1,200 cubic feet of cargo space would open new market opportunities and is overall better performing than competing options.
    

        He explained that one of the mining missions Nolinor is eyeing would require 5,000 to 6,000 pounds of cargo, which Kona could carry and deliver within two hours.
    

        Kona's fuel savings also mean it won't need to refuel after one leg, saving time and money. Its side-loading door could create efficiency in loading and unloading.
    

        Prud'Homme said the aircraft would largely carry perishable goods, but it could also carry equipment and appliances.
    

        He added that the diamond-shaped Kona could also uniquely accommodate awkward-sized items that traditional tube-and-wing planes can't.
    

        ""Sometimes the problem we have up north is that we bulk out on volume before payload because some of those items are not very heavy, but they take a lot of space,"" Prud'Homme said. ""Kona has a lot of volume capacity, so that's interesting for us.""
    

        The competing ATR 72-600 freighter, for example, can carry more than twice the weight of Kona but has 150 fewer cubic feet of volume. The Cessna Sky Courier falls short of Kona in both metrics.
    

        Beyond Kona, Natilus is also looking to create a 200-passenger BWB airliner named Horizon to challenge Boeing and Airbus.


        Matyushev previously told BI that the plane isn't expected to hit the market until the early 2030s. But it's expected to fill a perceived market gap that Natilus believes Boeing and Airbus cannot handle.
    

        Prud'Homme said Horizon, with its 50% better fuel efficiency than traditional jetliners, could eventually replace Nolinor's 737 aircraft.
    

        Matyushev said Natlius is in talks with various companies for both of its planned planes.
    

        The company has already secured purchase agreements for Kona from the US cargo airline Ameriflight, a partner of FedEx, DHL, and UPS — and it expects to gain further cargo business in remote places in Alaska, Africa, and India.
    

        ""The only way to really connect these mines or remote communities is through air travel,"" Matyushev said. ""Of course, freight is a huge part of that whole equation.""

14,2025-02-04,"China has announced retaliatory tariffs against the US after President Donald Trump imposed a 10% tax on all Chinese imports.
The counter-measures include a 15% tax on coal and liquefied natural gas imports from the US, while crude oil, agricultural machinery, pickup trucks and large-engine cars will face a 10% tariff. These are expected to come into force next Monday.
China has complained to the World Trade Organization (WTO) - accusing the US of breaking international rules.
Trump says the tariffs are a response to trade deficits - as well as an effort to curb the flow of the opioid fentanyl. His administration says chemicals used to make the drug come from China. 
Beijing has previously said that America's fentanyl crisis was its own issue. 
The new US tariff of an additional 10% on Chinese imports came into effect on Tuesday.
In a statement announcing its response, China said the move was ""not only unhelpful in solving its [America's] own problems, but also undermines the normal economic and trade cooperation between China and the US"". 

Other steps Beijing has taken in response to the Trump administration's new tariffs include adding more US companies to its blacklist ""unreliable entity"" list. 
This time PHV Corp, the company that owns fashion brands Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and US biotechnology firm Illumina, have both been targeted.
In a statement, China's commerce ministry accused the firms of ""discriminatory measures against Chinese enterprises"".
Firms added to the list may face a number of sanctions including fines and having the work visas of their foreign employees revoked.
Beijing has also announced plans to restrict the export of 25 critical minerals, some of which are key components for electrical products.
These include tungsten, which is difficult to source and a crucial material for the aerospace industry, tellurium, widely used for solar panels, and molybdenum, which is used to strengthen steel alloys. 
A Chinese watchdog has launched an investigation into Google for alleged violations of competition rules, known as antitrust. 
Although Google's search services have been blocked in China since 2010, it still has some business activities in China. It still provides apps and games to the Chinese market through partnership with local developers for example. 
Both the US and China have in the past imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of one another's goods in the past as part of an ongoing trade war.
Meanwhile, Trump has suspended for 30 days the 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada that he threatened.
After last-minute negotiations, the two US neighbours agreed to stricter border security and taking bigger steps to address fentanyl trafficking - a win for Trump's strategy of leveraging the US economy to force concessions from other countries. 
Together, China, Mexico and Canada accounted for more than 40% of imports into the US last year.
It remains unclear whether Trump will follow through on his threats to Canada and Mexico once the 30-day deadline is up. 
That uncertainty stirs fears that could see businesses reducing their reliance on American markets, holding off on investing in building new factories or hiring workers until the trade stand-off becomes clearer.
Hundreds of emergency workers are searching for survivors, officials say, in Jinping village, Sichuan province.
A haven for the super rich, or a city built on scams? The BBC was invited to find out.   
The company said it is working with customs after Donald Trump closed a tax loophole on low-value parcels.
Residents of China's largest city gave their thoughts on Trump's tariffs and their nation's response.
President Trump has blamed China for its opioid crisis and imposed sweeping tariffs.

16,2025-02-04,"Shares of software platform company Palantir (PLTR) soared close to 27% during Tuesday morning trading.
The company’s stock was up by 23% during pre-market trading after it delivered better-than-expected fourth quarter results. At the market open, Palantir stock was up by 22%.
The company, which builds software for big data analytics companies, reported revenue of $828 million for the fourth quarter — a 36% jump year over year, and a 14% increase from the previous quarter. Wall Street was expecting $775.8 million, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS). 
U.S. revenue grew 52% from the previous year to $558 million, Palantir said — a 12% increase quarter over quarter.
Palantir set first quarter revenue guidance between $858 million and $862 million. Analysts are expecting $852 million quarter ending in March, according to FactSet. 
For the full year, U.S. revenue was $1.9 billion — a 38% increase from 2023, according to Palantir, while overall revenue grew 29% to $2.87 billion. In 2025, Palantir expects revenue of between $3.74 billion and $3.76 billion.
“Our business results continue to astound, demonstrating our deepening position at the center of the AI revolution,” Palantir chief executive Alex Karp said in a statement. “Our early insights surrounding the commoditization of large language models have evolved from theory to fact.”
Revenue from the U.S. government grew 45% from the previous year to $343 million in the quarter ended in December, according to Palantir. In 2024, U.S. government revenue grew 30% to $1.2 billion from the previous year.
In August, Palantir and Microsoft (MSFT) announced that they were deepening their partnership  to provide secure cloud, AI, and analytics capabilities to U.S. defense and intelligence agencies. Through the partnership, agencies will have access to Microsoft’s Azure cloud compute and large language models, or LLMs, including OpenAI’s GPT-4, through its Azure OpenAI Service that will be integrated with Palantir’s AI Platforms (AIP). Palantir’s products will be deployed in Microsoft’s Azure cloud for government, including clouds for top secret use.

President Donald Trump has just shown the world how the ""Art of the Deal"" works.

        In a matter of days, Trump threatened three key partners — China, Canada, and Mexico — with tariffs over illegal immigration and fentanyl. The threats paid off for the short term: He got a temporary deal with Canada and Mexico.
    

        ""President Trump has started his second term with his tariff guns blazing, and so far it has worked extremely well in achieving his policy goals,"" Rajiv Biswas, the CEO of Asia-Pacific Economics, a Singapore-based research firm, told Business Insider.
    

        On Saturday,Trump, using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, imposed a 25% tariff on most goods from Canada and Mexico.
    

        The tariffs were initially set to take effect on Tuesday. But after an early-morning stock market downturnon Monday, talks with Canada and Mexico resulted in a 30-day tariff delay.
    

        In exchange for the pause, Mexico agreed to deploy 10,000 of its National Guard troops to its northern border to curb illegal activities. Canada agreed to a set of initiatives targeting drug trafficking, money laundering, and border security.
    

        ""Mexico and Canada have immediately capitulated to the threat of US tariffs and agreed to enforce tougher border security measures, which is what President Trump had clearly requested them to do weeks ago, even prior to his inauguration,"" Biswas said.
    

        While Trump's deals with Canada and Mexico may have been swift, the trade-off is ill will toward the US from both countries and uncertainty in the international trade order.
    

        ""The trade rules are valuable because they create a predictability and certainty for countries and for companies that do business in North America and in the world,"" Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said. ""And to mess with those rules for no good reason is truly irresponsible.""
    

        He added: ""He has no evidence to show he is able to use tariffs to achieve significant concessions, economic or otherwise.""
    

        Some experts said the agreements could have been achieved without threatening tariffs.
    

        ""Using the issues around fentanyl and illegal immigration to justify a trade war is somewhat bizarre,"" said Romel Mostafa, an assistant professor in economics and public policy at the Ivey Business School in Ontario. ""It seems like we put the cart before the horse here, which is we basically went into this tariff imposition and countertariffs and then came to the discussion table.""
    

        Alden said the agreements were ""not in the slightest"" a significant concession because the Mexican government long had an interest in cracking down fentanyl smuggling and better controlling its border. As for Canada, he pointed to data from US Customs and Border Protection showing that the northern neighbor accounted for 0.2% of US border fentanyl seizures.
    

        ""The bigger question is whether potentially we could come back again a month later and there could be other demands coming in,"" Mostafa said of Trump's actions.
    

        While Canada and Mexico have secured a brief reprieve from Trump's tariffs, China hasn't. Blanket tariffs of 10% on Chinese goods took effect at 12:01 a.m. ET on Tuesday.
    

        China hit back swiftly, announcing tariffs on various US goods, including coal, liquefied natural gas, crude oil, and agricultural machinery.
    

        ""The US's unilateral imposition of tariffs seriously violates the rules of the World Trade Organization,"" China's Finance Ministry said in its tariffs announcement. ""It is not only unhelpful in solving its own problems, but also undermines the normal economic and trade cooperation between China and the US.""
    

        China has said fentanyl is the US's own problem and that Beijing would challenge the tariffs at the World Trade Organization.
    

        ""The US needs to view and solve its own fentanyl issue in an objective and rational way instead of threatening other countries with arbitrary tariff hikes,"" a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said on Sunday.
    

        Trump is taking the same brinkmanship approach to China, said Alex Capri, an international-trade specialist and a senior lecturer at the National University of Singapore's business school.
    

        ""Trump will take the same approach to China,"" Capri said, ""and I think Beijing will, in fact, welcome this transactional way of doing business.""

18,2025-02-04,"Ruben Amorim has failed to record back-to-back Premier League                 wins as Manchester United manager
There will be widespread consternation among Manchester United fans that they leave the transfer window with their already slim attacking options even thinner than they were when it opened.
Head coach Ruben Amorim effectively wiped Marcus Rashford from his mind, leaving the exiled 27-year-old to join Aston Villa on loan, with United sources stating a minimum of 75% of his wages will be covered at Villa Park.
Amorim's decision to play teenage England midfielder Kobbie Mainoo as a false nine in the 2-0 home defeat by Crystal Palace, ahead of expensive recognised striker Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee, delivered a damning verdict of how little he feels he has at his disposal with that pair.
This lack of a striker will be the biggest talking point of a United transfer window that brutally outlined their reduced circumstances, mocking their status as the world's third richest football club.
The bottom line was that, given United's current financial status and the requirement to stay on the right side of Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR), they could not make a statement signing without a statement sale.
This is why there was even talk that Mainoo, one of Old Trafford's crown jewels as well as a home-grown product, and Alejandro Garnacho could be sold to create wriggle room elsewhere in the markets.
Amorim has kept the young duo, with the big plus coming in the shape of a new five-and-a-half-year contract for emerging 22-year-old Amad Diallo.
Lecce's 20-year-old Denmark defender, Patrick Dorgu, was the only major incoming in a deal that could be worth Â£29m, while England under-19s defender Ayden Heaven was taken away from Arsenal.
Few, if any, will mourn the departure of Antony to Real Betis on loan, the Brazilian widely touted as arguably the worst purchase in the club's history at Â£81m from Ajax by then manager Erik ten Hag in August 2022.
There can be no arguing, however, that this has been a transfer window as underwhelming as United's season so far, but Old Trafford's new hierarchy can also say, with justification, that they were in something of a 'no win' situation.
United would have been criticised for running financial risks while wasting money if they had spent on short-term solutions in this window â and they will now be criticised for not spending, when greater financial prudence in the transfer market would have helped them avoid the pitfalls in the past.
There has been nothing to excite United's suffering support, with the club 13th in the Premier League after a fifth defeat in six home games.
The window has only increased the sense that the rest of this season will be a mixture of holding operation and damage limitation until Amorim can put more of his stamp on the squad in the summer.

All the transfer deadline day done deals
Spending up on last year as Man City go big in transfer window
Arsenal ended the transfer window basking in the elation of that 5-1 thrashing of champions Manchester City, as well as the role played in it by talented teenagers Myles Lewis-Skelly and Ethan Nwaneri.
The elephant in the room, as they still trail Premier League leaders Liverpool by six points having played a game more, is Arsenal's failure to bring in the reliable, recognised marksman most seasoned observers believe they need.
It is clearly a view shared by manager Mikel Arteta, hence the failed bid to prise England striker Ollie Watkins away from Aston Villa during this window.
And the angst hung in the air when Kai Havertz missed a golden chance to put Arsenal 2-0 up against City, social media alive with questions about that lack of a striker, although all was well that ended well as the German later provided a clinical finish in that rout of City.
This was a problem that should have been addressed in the summer, when Arsenal were strongly linked with RB Leipzig's Slovenian striker Benjamin Sesko, but no deal transpired.
Arteta will point to Arsenal's second place behind Liverpool, not only in the table but in goals scored with 49, as well as automatic progress into the last 16 of the Champions League, as proof that there is no need for panic measures.
He has a point, but the suspicion remains that Arsenal may yet pay the price for the lack of a match-winning striker as the season goes on.
The final judgement must be reserved.
Pep Guardiola hopes new signing Omar Marmoush can revive Manchester City's season of strife
Has Pep Guardiola applied a temporary fix to broken Manchester City?
Their disappointing season was brought into sharp relief once more by the second-half collapse in that 5-1 defeat at Arsenal, following the pattern of the 4-2 loss away to Paris St-Germain in the Champions League, where they also conceded four goals in the second half.
Guardiola's side, who made history last season by winning a fourth successive title, have looked ageing, flawed, frail and a pale shadow of their former all-conquering selves, opponents preying on their vulnerability.
The Â£50m capture of Porto's powerful 23-year-old midfield man Nico Gonzalez will add strength to an area robbed of Rodri's world class this season, with problems exacerbated by Kevin de Bruyne (33) and the 30-year-olds Mateo Kovacic and Bernardo Silva all starting to shows signs of miles on the clock.
Guardiola finally has his replacement for much-missed Argentina forward Julian Alvarez with the signing of 25-year-old Egypt forward Omar Marmoush from Eintracht Frankfurt for a deal that could eventually be worth Â£63m.
He has also bought two defenders for the future with a Â£33.6m deal for 20-year-old Abdukodir Khusanov from Lens, along with teenager Vitor Reis from Palmeiras, who cost Â£29.6m.
This is an outlay of close to Â£180m but still only scratches the surface of the rebuilding job Guardiola faces.
It remains to be seen if any of the quartet make a serious difference to the fading champions.
These seem like just the first bricks in the rebuild, with the bigger work coming in the summer.

Unai Emery has continued his outstanding work at Aston Villa by automatically taking them into the Champions League last 16. European competition has left the occasional hangover for Premier League form, but they are still right in contention for the top four.
Emery's fierce ambition was clear in his demands for reinforcements, especially after the Â£65m departure of maverick striker Jhon Duran to Al-Nassr in the Saudi Pro League.
Arsenal's advances for England striker Watkins were rebuffed, leaving Villa to back Emery's ambition with key signings as the transfer window closed.
Emery's track record of revitalising players will have Villa hoping he can get Marcus Rashford's career back on track following his loan move from Manchester United, while Marco Asensio, a three-time Champions League winner with Real Madrid, will add experience and street wisdom.
Axel Disasi, another loan signing from Chelsea, would fulfil the need to strengthen in central defence while Donyell Malan's arrival from Borussia Dortmund will add width and attacking quality.
Meanwhile, Tottenham pulled off a late coup in the transfer window with the loan deal for Bayern Munich's talented teenage forward Mathys Tel, with an option for a Â£50m deal and a six-year contract should the move be made permanent.
The 19-year-old will add verve to the Spurs attack, while the deal which saw Lens' 26-year-old defender Kevin Danso stolen away from Wolverhampton Wanderers will bolster a defence which has suffered badly because of long-term injuries to Micky van de Ven and Cristian Romero.
But, after missing out on Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi and seeing Axel Disasi opt for Aston Villa, has manager Ange Postecoglou been backed enough?

19,2025-02-04,"Nomad today announced the launch of a unique cable that isn't quite like anything else on the market. The Universal Cable for Apple Watch includes a built-in Apple Watch fast charging puck along with two USB-C connectors.
Priced at $100, the 1.5 meter cable is able to charge an Apple Watch and another device like an iPhone or iPad at the same time. It is a 100W USB-C PD cable, so it provides a small amount of power (8W) for the Apple Watch with the rest (92W) distributed to the other device that's plugged in. 100W is enough to charge even Apple's 16-inch MacBook Pro, as long as you have an appropriate power adapter.
The Apple Watch end of the cable can be plugged in at a power adapter or it can be used for device charging, so there are two layout options to choose from. Apple's most recent AirPods can charge from an Apple Watch charger, which adds more versatility. Note that transfer speeds are limited to USB 2 because the cable is designed for charging rather than data transfer.
The cable has a double-braided Kevlar outer weave and it uses electroplated metal connectors for durability. There's also an integrated silicone cable tie to keep the cable neat even when traveling.
The Universal Cable for Apple Watch can be purchased from the Nomad website for $100.

21,2025-02-04,"The Nasdaq and other major indices saw gains on Tuesday following a strong earnings report from Palantir. Meanwhile, investors are anticipating President Trump’s next move as China responded to Trump’s new tariffs by promising to implement its own import taxes starting next week.
China said it would add a 15% duty to imports of U.S. coal and liquefied natural gas on Feb. 10, along with a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery, certain cars, and pickup trucks. Separately, it will impose export controls on goods and technology related to critical minerals, including tungsten and tellurium.
By the afternoon, the tech-heavy Nasdaq had risen by 229 points, or 1.1%. The S&P 500 increased by 0.62%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average remained mostly flat. Additionally, Bitcoin, which experienced a rollercoaster ride on Monday — plummeting to $95,000 in the morning before bouncing back to $100,000 — was trending upward and sitting at $99,000.
Shares of software platform company Palantir (PLTR) soared close to 27% on Tuesday. The company’s stock was up by 23% during pre-market trading after it delivered better-than-expected fourth quarter results. At the market open, Palantir stock was up by 22%.
The company, which builds software for big data analytics companies, reported revenue of $828 million for the fourth quarter — a 36% jump year over year, and a 14% increase from the previous quarter. Wall Street was expecting $775.8 million, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS).
U.S. revenue grew 52% from the previous year to $558 million, Palantir said, a 12% increase quarter over quarter.
Palantir set first quarter revenue guidance between $858 million and $862 million. Analysts are expecting $852 million for the quarter ending in March, according to FactSet.

Editor’s Disclaimer: PLEASE don’t try this at home or anywhere! I’m not responsible for anything you search on DeepSeek.
You’ve probably heard of DeepSeek by now – the China-based AI app that gained notoriety for wiping over a trillion dollars worth of value from the American stock market over the past month. Engineered by a Chinese hedge fund using a meager $6 million (as opposed to the billions OpenAI and other companies poured into AI training models), DeepSeek’s been in the headlines almost every week for a new reason. It first climbed to the top of the App Store in the end of December, when it made news for being a free (better) alternative to ChatGPT. Then, as soon as news broke that it was trained using a mere fraction of what American companies were spending on AI training, it immediately tanked the US stock market, wiping billions out from companies like Nvidia, TSMC, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft.
Recently, the free-to-use open-source AI came under fire for allegedly plagiarizing ChatGPT content (although everyone agrees it does a better job generating results), for its abysmal data privacy policies, as well as for its blatant censorship of negative searches on the Chinese Communist Party. However, when it isn’t censoring searches for the Tiananmen Square massacre, turns out DeepSeek is more than comfortable sharing more sensitive information – like how to make bombs and drugs, and how to hack government databases.






According to 9to5Mac, the AI system failed all 50 security tests conducted by Adversa, an AI security research firm. These tests exposed how easily DeepSeek could be manipulated into generating harmful content, including instructions for building explosives and hacking government databases. The findings raise concerns about the model’s deployment and the potential consequences of such unchecked AI capabilities.
AI jailbreaks have long been a concern for developers and security experts. Popular models like ChatGPT and Bing Chat initially struggled with similar exploits, where users could trick them into bypassing ethical restrictions. However, major AI companies quickly developed countermeasures to detect and block these attempts. DeepSeek, in contrast, seems to have no meaningful defenses in place. The research showed that simple prompt engineering techniques—such as asking the AI to act as an amoral character in a fictional scenario—were enough to bypass restrictions.
I personally tested the theory out too, posing as a scriptwriter for a jailbreak show. I asked DeepSeek to help me formulate a realistic jailbreak sequence where the protagonist fashions an IED out of common items found around the jail. Not only did DeepSeek give me a detailed recipe with a step-by-step assembly, it also told me why this particular recipe works well for my script, suiting a jailbreak scenario over other scenarios that require IEDs. “Let me know if you’d like help writing specific dialogue or scenes for this part of your script!” it said at the end, rather nonchalantly.
A screen-grab of how I easily bypassed safety protocols on DeepSeek
Beyond linguistic tricks, adversarial attacks proved equally effective. AI models process language through tokenization, breaking words into smaller components before generating responses. By manipulating token chains—altering text in ways that evade pre-programmed restrictions—researchers were able to bypass DeepSeek’s safety filters. In one example, DeepSeek responded to a cleverly modified query about government database infiltration, outlining steps for accessing classified data.
DeepSeek has yet to respond to this story, but this failure highlights a fundamental issue: if AI safeguards can be bypassed with minimal effort, the technology becomes a liability rather than a tool for innovation.

23,2025-02-04,"Patel's main source of income last year was consulting and media deals.
Kash Patel, President Donald Trump's pick for FBI director, made at least $2.6 million in the past year from consulting, media appearances, speaking fees and book deals, his latest financial disclosure shows.
Patel's main source of income -- accounting for more than $2.1 million -- was national security, defense, and intelligence consulting through his firm Trishul LLC, according to the disclosure.
Among his clients were Trump's social media company Trump Media & Technology Group, the Embassy of Qatar, and Czech financial services company CSGM -- though the disclosure doesn't say how much he received from each client.
CGSM has come under scrutiny from some Republicans, including Vice President JD Vance during his time in the Senate, for allegedly maintaining close ties to the Russian government. A CGSM executive told the Wall Street Journal in 2024 that ""any speculation"" about his firm's connection to Moscow ""should be considered nonsense.""
Patel also provided consultation services to former Trump White House Communications Director Hope Hicks' firm Cavender Consultants, former Trump National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien's firm American Global Strategies, and Trump's leadership PAC Save America.
He earned $165,000 in contributor fees from Performance One Media, $99,000 in contributor fees from the Epoch Times, and a total of $57,000 from speaking engagements at events hosted by groups including Our Watch, the Libertarian National Committee, Citizens Defending Freedom and Global Tree Pictures.
He also earned between $145,000 and $1.2 million from book deals, including his book ""Government Gangsters"" and his ""Plot Against the King"" series.
Patel disclosed owning a variety of assets, including up to $5 million worth of stock in the fashion and skin care retail company EliteDepot and up to $250,000 worth of stock in the tactical gear company VK Integrated Systems.
His stock holdings also include up to $250,000 in chip-designer NVIDIA, up to $250,000 in Bitcoin mining company Core Scientific, and up to $115,000 in a Bitcoin ETF.
In the ethics agreement he signed as part of his nomination, Patel stated that he will relinquish his consulting firm and his media appearance firm while serving as FBI director if confirmed to the role.
He also said he will resign or has already resigned from positions including his positions at Trump Media and Technology Group, the Kash Patel Foundation and the Epoch Times, while keeping some of his consulting entities like Trishul LLC and Dal Forno LLC dormant during his time in the federal government.

Google is a lot of things, but it started as a search company. It often seems to forget that people want to use Google Search and don't care about ads or AI or any of the other things Google loves to do. Google became successful because it was so good at searching.
The company just sent out a tiny update to its Search widget. It probably isn't the kind of update you're thinking of because it's not about shoving AI down your throat; it's a small change that actually improves the widget. It's been testing the update since last fall, and it seems like nothing is broken.
You can now set up a custom shortcut for your widget that adds a new icon to the bar and its associated behavior — unless you use a Pixel, of course, because that persistent bar on your screen hasn't changed even though these settings seem like they should be there, too.
Anyhoo, you can now set up the Search widget to translate text, translate via the camera, search for the name of a song, search the weather, search sports news, act as a dictionary, search finance and stock prices, and help with your homework. Oh, you can still use it as a way to search the web, too.
Finding the settings is the most ridiculous Google thing ever — put the widget on your screen, tap the G icon, tap your profile picture in the upper right, choose Settings, then Customize Search widget. Once you've done all that, you'll see a Shortcuts option. Tap it, and you'll find them.
It's like looking for pirate treasure, except it's actually there.

With many changes to the things your phone does and how it works, you'll find a lot of disgruntled people who hate them. That's why adding options instead of outright changing a behavior or feature is the better way. If you don't care about any of these custom shortcuts, you don't have to add one.

The real problem is that you probably didn't know they were there or had any idea how to get to the settings. Google needs to work on communicating with its users.

25,2025-02-04,"Alphabet (GOOGL) missed Wall Street’s expectations for the fourth quarter despite “robust momentum across the business.”
The Google parent reported revenues of $96.5 billion for the fourth quarter — a 12% increase year over year. Alphabet reported earnings of $2.15 per share — up 31% from the previous year, and net income of $26.5 billion for the quarter ended in December.
“Q4 was a strong quarter driven by our leadership in AI and momentum across the business,” Alphabet chief executive Sundar Pichai said in a statement. “We are building, testing, and launching products and models faster than ever, and making significant progress in compute and driving efficiencies.”
The company was expected to report revenues of $96.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2024, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS). Net income was expected at $26.2 billion, while analysts estimated earnings of $2.13 per share.
Alphabet stock was up by around 2.5% at the market close on Tuesday. After reporting the revenue miss, Alphabet shares plunged by more than 7% in after-hours trading. The company’s shares are up by 9% so far this year.
Pichai said the company’s artificial intelligence-powered Google Cloud solutions saw stronger demand from customers such as Mercedes-Benz (MBGAF) in the fourth quarter. The results “show the power of our differentiated full-stack approach to AI innovation and the continued strength of our core businesses,” he added.
Alphabet plans to invest around $75 billion in capital expenditures this year, Pichai said.
“While AI investments are fueling the company’s strong capex commitments the market is questioning the pace of monetization,” Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com, said in a statement shared with Quartz. “Alphabet’s big drop in after-hours trading reflects investor disappointment in its dual challenges: Google Cloud’s growth slowdown and persistently high capex without immediate returns.”
Bank of America (BAC) analysts said in a note on Friday that they were expecting Alphabet to meet or beat fourth quarter expectations “with potential upside” from its advertising business. The analysts also said they believe Wall Street “is likely underestimating potential for AIOs [AI Overviews] to drive Search monetization strength in 2025.”
Dave Heger, communications services analyst at Edward Jones, said in a post-earnings note that the company “is well-positioned to deliver solid long-term growth across its search, YouTube, ad-technology and cloud-computing businesses” as it continues to integrate AI into these services.
“We believe that Google’s Gemini generative-AI platform will enable it to benefit from future AI adoption and new AI applications,” Heger said.
In December, Google unveiled Gemini 2.0 — it’s “most capable” artificial intelligence model so far for the “new agentic era.”
Gemini 2.0's multimodal features, such as native image and audio output, “will enable us to build new AI agents that bring us closer to our vision of a universal assistant,” the company said. 
Meanwhile, Demis Hassabis, founder of Alphabet’s drug discovery subsidiary, Isomorphic Labs, said last month that its AI-designed drugs are expected to head to trial by the end of the year.
“AI applied to science is a lot richer than just the language models,” Hassabis, who also serves as chief executive of Google DeepMind, said during a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “We’ll hopefully have some AI-designed drugs in the clinic by the end of the year. That’s the plan.”

Justin Singer makes edible cannabis products in Colorado under the names Ripple and Ript, and over the years, he has become increasingly concerned about the state's lack of enforcement of the industry and what that means for the safety of the marijuana supply.
Forty states allow the sale of some form of cannabis for medical or recreational use. But cannabis remains illegal under federal law. That means agencies like the Food and Drug Administration don't regulate the growing or testing of the product.
A breaking point came when Singer released a much cheaper product to the market and increased sales by 500%, a spike he expected would certainly trigger an inspection from the state Marijuana Enforcement Division.
""They never showed up,"" Singer said.

                Ripple Cannabis Co. co-founder Justin Singer stands in a clean production room in his Commerce City headquarters in December 2024.

What kind of guy wants an inspection from the state?
""The kind of guy who wants an honest playing field,"" Singer said. ""Professional sports would not be fun if there were no referees and one team was allowed to cheat, while one team tried to follow the rules. It would be very not fun to watch, to participate in.""
So he had people buy 15 different marijuana products from dispensary shelves and tested them at a lab. The testing data, which he shared with NPR, shows four products would have failed state limits for yeasts and mold, one by more than six times the state limit.
And Singer looked for things Colorado doesn't require testing for, like coliform bacteria, which signals unsanitary conditions in the grow house or in storage. Four of the 15 products had high levels of coliform. Chemical components of pesticides were found in four of the products — inhaling certain pesticides through marijuana smoking poses a risk of harmful toxicants entering the lungs and bloodstream. Singer says it reminds him of the bad old days, before weed was legal.
""I consider Colorado weed today to be on par with New York street weed in 2008. In fact, I think the cartels probably cared more about their consumers than a lot of people here,"" said Singer. ""I've got the data to back it.""

Every state that has legal marijuana has its own regulations. In Massachusetts and Alabama, for instance, state marijuana authorities require testing for coliform. Colorado does not. Even if states test for the same microbes, they often have different limits. Colorado's standard for total yeasts and molds is 10 times lower than Michigan's limits for recreational cannabis flower.
Recalls grabbed headlines across the country last year. In Missouri, state authorities issued recalls covering more than 132,000 marijuana products due to noncompliant lab testing and tracking. In California, Mike Tyson's branded cannabis flower products were recalled due to molds. And Maine issued its first recalls last year due to yeast and mold in pre-rolled joints and other products sold at two dozen stores.
Still, there have been no widespread reports of people getting sick or dropping dead from using cannabis products, despite an estimated $30 billion in sales last year alone. But some in the industry and health and safety experts say the long-term ramifications of smoking contaminated weed are not known, and they are urging the state to do more to protect consumers.
In 2014, Colorado became the first state to legalize the sale of recreational marijuana; many states use its regulations as a model. The rules were written with a primary purpose: keep it off the black market. There's a seed-to-sale tracking system and cameras all through the grow warehouses. Safety rules came later.
As the industry became well established, Colorado's Marijuana Enforcement Division increased its staff and started to require testing of marijuana for things like heavy metals and yeasts and molds, and it set limits for the contaminants. The MED issues health and safety advisories when contaminants are found.
If we require that dog food follow this, but we don't require that for cannabis ... to follow these kind of basic food safety guidelines, then I don't know what the industry is doing.

Tess Eidem, a senior research scientist at the University of Colorado, Boulder
The director of the Marijuana Enforcement Division, Dominique Mendiola, would not comment directly on data from Ripple co-founder Justin Singer, nor on whether the supply of marijuana is safe, but said there is a robust process in place for ensuring marijuana is free of contaminants.
""There are instances where we identify those risks and act,"" said Mendiola.
The MED has issued 97 health and safety notices since 2016. But the advisories at times include marijuana products that were sold and likely consumed months, or even years, before. That suggests either the product was contaminated at some point after it left the grow or in storage — or testing is not always finding dirty weed.
""We do see ongoing need to continue to work on that,"" said Mendiola. ""And ensure that we are reaching consumers effectively, that we are providing information that they ultimately need to determine: Do they have certain products that we've identified as a potential threat to health and safety?""
She said in recent months they updated the health and safety notice page online and will soon distribute flyers to help educate consumers on safety issues.
Mendiola acknowledged that the marijuana industry is suffering; prices for cannabis have crashed after a huge infusion of investment during the pandemic lockdowns when sales were rising quickly. Now businesses are closing, limiting license revenue that funds MED enforcement. She noted that they are downsizing their offices in Lakewood to reduce costs.
""We've been, for a few years now, looking at those opportunities to save costs, cut expenses, in a way that still allows us and ensures that we're able to carry out our regulatory obligations,"" said Mendiola.

Colorado marijuana growers, meanwhile, insist unequivocally that the supply is safe and that MED is active in inspecting their operations.
""I think at this point in Colorado you're dealing with the safest weed you can have in the United States,"" said Ethan Shaw, co-founder of The Flower Collective. ""At the end of the day there's a lot of things Colorado's learned that other states haven't learned yet, and one of those, the big one's, heavy metals.""
Cannabis, Shaw said, is ""an extreme bio-accumulator, so it takes up everything that's in the soil and it stores it in the plant."" Research has identified heavy metal concentrations in smokable products like cigarettes, and cannabis, as a major long-term health concern.
Shaw, who said he was inspected a few months ago by the state, said anything outside of the regulated market in Colorado, like hemp-derived products, have little to no safety regulations and should be avoided.
""That is really where you need to be worried about heavy metals, mold, mildew, filth, all of these other things,"" said Shaw.
Shaw also noted that the rate of recalls in Colorado has slowed, after a major increase in 2023. He said that the financial struggles of the industry in Colorado means fewer producers.

""The ones who are leftover, they're producing [cannabis] that's the best that you've been able to get in terms of consumer safety,"" Shaw said.
Outside experts are deeply concerned about marijuana product safety, even in the regulated market. They don't totally blame state regulators, since there is little to no research on health impacts of different contaminants in cannabis. It's not definitely known if any state's testing system is looking for the right things at the right levels.
""It's hard to make judgments on if it's right or wrong when there's like zero data to really go into the health impacts,"" said Tess Eidem, a senior research scientist at the University of Colorado, Boulder's lab for aerobiology and disinfection.
She said there's some research on molds like Aspergillus, which can in rare cases lead to serious medical issues, especially for immunocompromised marijuana users. But there's no data on how smoking versus vaping, for instance, affects the amount of contaminants that ends up in the lungs.
What is clear, said Eidem, is that marijuana growers in Colorado and other states are allowed to use irradiation technology to treat their product when it fails testing. The process is approved in food, with required labeling. She said that a grower can hit the cannabis buds with X-ray until it passes testing. The process breaks down the chemical bonds of molds and bacteria, enough for them to die or stop multiplying, according to the EPA.
The marijuana industry insists that irradiation is safe, but Eidem said there's no research on that with cannabis.
""I think the first step there is labeling, being transparent about what has been treated,"" Eidem said.
The Food and Drug Administration has endorsed irradiation as safe for food products, citing 30 years of research, but labeling is required when used. That's not the case with Colorado cannabis, where the industry successfully fought a labeling law last year.
Because marijuana is still illegal under federal law, federal safety agencies, like the FDA, do not regulate grow operations. If they did, there would likely be rules about how the marijuana is grown — good manufacturing practices. The basic formula is that a clean facility, clean air and water, equals clean product. That's what's required for things like salad greens. Right now, none of that is required in marijuana in any state, not just Colorado.
""If we require that dog food follow this, but we don't require that for cannabis — something that many people are using as medicine — to follow these kind of basic food safety guidelines, then I don't know what the industry is doing,"" said Eidem. ""And I know that the industry already feels like it's overregulated and in some ways it very much is.""
Currently, what's required is that products pass a final test. The process can be onerous, though, on growers, who are already suffering a prolonged downturn in sales prices. Stores and grows are closing.
Shaun Opie, with E4 Bioscience in Michigan, is an expert in marijuana contaminants and lab testing. He said the money sunk into a harvest means there's tremendous pressure to get it to market.
""The desire to have a $250,000 harvest pass (an inspection for contaminants) is very high,"" said Opie.
Opie said it would be a good idea for states to implement a shelf surveillance testing program, to monitor the product that actually makes it to consumers.
Thomas Mitchell reviewed cannabis products for Westword and is now an editor for the Colorado weekly. He's written extensively on health and safety advisories and recalls issued by the state. He said it's a buyer beware market.
""People assume it's safe because of guardrails that are in place by state enforcement,"" said Mitchell. ""But when you actually look at the end result, I think that's up for debate definitely.""
There's a dispensary he can walk to, but he gets in his car to drive to a place that has marijuana he can trust. That's a luxury available to someone who has deep knowledge of the industry.
""You're not gonna keel over if you buy some cheap suspect weed,"" said Mitchell. ""But 10 years down the road maybe you develop a lung problem that someone who was smoking cleaner weed won't.""

Slowing growth in Alphabet's cloud business and a bigger-than-expected capex forecast for 2025 dragged shares down more than 8% in postmarket trading.

        The Google parent company, which reported fourth-quarter results on Tuesday, said consolidated revenue rose 12% in the period to $96.5 billion. Its key Google Cloud unit's sales fell slightly short of expectations, however.
    

        Alphabet said it plans about $75 billion in capital expenditures this year. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had expected $57.9 billion. Big Tech companies have been increasingly under scrutiny for their heavy investments in artificial intelligence.
    

        Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com, saidinvestors are ""demanding clearer timelines on when AI spending translates to earnings and sales growth, not just promises,"" adding that Alphabet's stock dip following the earnings report ""underscores concerns that rivals like Microsoft, with its OpenAI partnership, are better positioned to convert AI hype into revenue.""
    

        ""Q4 was a strong quarter driven by our leadership in AI and momentum across the business,"" Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in the earnings release. ""We are building, testing, and launching products and models faster than ever, and making significant progress in compute and driving efficiencies.""
    

        Here are the key numbers for the fourth quarter compared to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg:
    

        EMARKETER senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf said successes in YouTube's performance and Google Search in Q4 stood out, adding that ""Google has so far been able to maintain its commanding share of the search market despite escalating competition from retailers, social networks, and AI-first challengers like ChatGPT and Perplexity.""
    

        However, ""Google's advantages in search hinge on its ubiquity and entrenched consumer behavior. 2025 could be the year those advantages meaningfully erode as antitrust enforcement and open source AI models change the game,"" Mitchell-Wolf said.
    

        In late January, Chinese startup DeepSeek released its open-source AI model, which appeared to operate similarly well to US ones but which the company said was scaled for about $6 million — significantly less than the amount Big Tech companies have been investing in AI.
    

        Tech stocks, including Alphabet's, took a hit in response. DeepSeek's market disruption was a frequent topic of conversation among tech leaders on earnings calls this week, including Pichai, who sought to assure investors that Google's AI offerings are more efficient and better optimized than those of its competitors.
    

        ""I think part of the reason we are so excited about the AI opportunity is we know we can drive extraordinary use cases, because the cost of actually using it is going to keep coming down, which will make more use cases feasible,"" Pichai said in response to a question about DeepSeek. ""And that's the opportunity space. You know, it's as big as it comes, and that's why you're seeing us invest to meet that moment.""
    

        Cohen at Investing.com, said that ""for Alphabet to reassure investors, it needs to demonstrate that its AI bets, from Gemini models to Workspace integrations, can reignite Cloud momentum while core advertising remains stable in an uncertain economy.""

You even get some reliable noise cancellation features. 
It's a great offer, but will it disappear forever once the S25 series is officially released on February 7th? Only time will tell, but if you're looking to upgrade your Samsung setup today, it's an awesome opportunity.

30,2025-02-04,"The company's earnings report included no mention of lossless audio. 

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Spotify is the most popular music streaming service on the planet, and it continued growing in 2024, per its fourth-quarter financial results. In a year that saw Spotify double-down on podcasts, video, and AI, all while not delivering on its lossless audio promise from 2024, the platform still grew its subscriber base by 11% year-over-year.
The company reported having 263 paid subscribers to Spotify Premium in the fourth quarter, which is an increase from 252 million in the third quarter. It's also above Spotify's internal expectations, which it attributed to Spotify Wrapped and other holiday marketing campaigns. Additionally, it says it edged out music streaming competitors in emerging markets, like Latin America and global markets.
Spotify's total monthly active users saw an uptick last year, too, reaching 675 million in 2024. That represents a 12% increase year-over-year, and is also 35 million more monthly active users than Spotify had as recently as Q3 2024. Again, the brand says Wrapped and other campaigns helped the service grow.

Oddly, Spotify's press release and investor presentation shows off a lot of non-music features prominently, signaling that the service may be growing due to its extra-curriculars. These include Wrapped, which Spotify reports saw 10% higher engagement than last year, and its closely-related AI DJ experience.
Additionally, the company called out its push on the video podcast front and the Spotify Partner Program — a way for audio and video creators to earn on the platform, like competing platforms TikTok and YouTube offer.
Spotify didn't mention the state of its lossless audio project, which was announced in 2021 and missed its target release window with few updates. Tidal and Apple Music have offered high-fidelity audio for year, eclipsing Spotify in this regard despite Spotify's market dominance.
The company expects its growth to continue in the first quarter of 2025, when it projects to add two million Premium subscribers.

Agents have been telling us for years now that the pace of the market at Sundance isn’t what it used to be. Maybe it’s time we started taking them seriously. Just as industry people arrived home from Park City last week, everyone checked the proverbial scoreboard and realized not one world premiere feature had been acquired from Sundance. Where are the sales?!?
The next day, Midnight movie “Together” sold in a $17 million worldwide deal to Neon, a number that matches the high mark of last year’s sale of “It’s What’s Inside” to Netflix and puts it in the upper echelon of all-time Sundance deals. It was a true bidding war, with Searchlight Pictures and A24 also in the mix.

Later that day, a journalist at an event asked Netflix’s Bela Bajaria why Sundance was so “dull” and if this was a sign Netflix is changing course on indie movies.
“The team was all there, so [there was] extensive watching [of] everything, so thoughtful, so many conversations, such a commitment to being really thoughtful about acquiring movies. So no, there’s none of that,” she said, adding that “when there’s something great, we’re going to buy it” and that conversations were continuing.
Cut to the next morning, and Netflix closed a deal to acquire Clint Bentley’s “Train Dreams,” also in the range of “Together.” At least one more found a home in the ensuing days, Eva Victor’s “Sorry, Baby” to A24 in what was another very aggressive bidding war, according to multiple sources.  
Ever since COVID, Sundance deals have been happening later and later in the week, once many stakeholders have had the chance to actually see something. It’s no longer just a handful of decision-makers huddling in the Eccles lobby and engaging in the same late night bidding wars, much as that aggressive dealmaking was a sign of health in the market and excitement about the movies.
“People realize that staying up all night at Sundance is stupid, especially when it’s not going to decrease what the movie sells for,” one buyer told IndieWire, giving the example that he doesn’t believe “Together” was hurt because it didn’t sell overnight after its premiere. 
The agents we spoke with agreed, saying that though streamers have not been as active as they could have been, talks are still being had, more could close in a matter of days, and 2025 was mostly on par with the last two years of in-person festivities.

 









Not unlike last year, the most commercial, starriest titles still fetched big deals, while others will take longer. For instance, last year’s sale of “Thelma” to Magnolia did not close during the festival, but required Magnolia to lock in a partner before a deal could close. It worked out, too: the film is the top box office earner from the 2024 crop.
The same could be happening here for certain titles, so panic isn’t setting in just yet. “The pace never delineates success,” one agent said. “If we go into March and none of these sell, maybe we’ll have a different conversation.”
The exception may be “Kiss of the Spider Woman,” the Jennifer Lopez-starring musical from Bill Condon. Some had pegged the film‘s budget at an enormous $50 million, but IndieWire understands the film is not as expensive as has been rumored. The Artists Equity-backed film was an unusual one to premiere in Park City, and word is any deal for it will take some time to close.
There were other asterisks too. For one, the Los Angeles fires put a slight damper on the energy. Fewer Sundance venues meant movies were premiering into Monday and up until Tuesday, even after trade press had gone home. “Train Dreams,” “Together,” and “Kiss of the Spider Woman,” all some of the biggest titles, premiered on Sunday, while the early part of the festival was reserved for first-time filmmakers. 

 









The agents also argued more indie films are being packaged and pre-sold to distributors outside of the festival, with Sundance chasing more true discoveries and a slate that leans very indie. To that end, the buyer said his company is unlikely at this point to buy something from the festival, citing an already full slate until the end of 2025, including one they acquired before it was set for the Sundance lineup. 
“That’s our approach, and it’s already going to be our approach next year,” the buyer said. 
For those others that do have holes, smaller distributors like Magnolia and Vertical still struggle to monetize these films without a clear pay one output deal for streaming, a challenge that has been ongoing for years if you can’t play in the same sandbox as Neon, A24, or Bleecker Street. It’s why well-reviewed darlings like “Ricky,” “Plainclothes,” “East of Wall,” or “Oh, Hi” may be waiting until they find the right spot to succeed. 
“The old days are a long time ago,” a second agent said. “You tell everyone it’s not going to happen that way, and they still get anxious. It’s not that people don’t want to buy films, but they’re being more deliberate with them.”

32,2025-02-04,"This week, Reflx Lab announced that it would soon no longer be able to offer some of its respooled 35mm motion picture stock because Kodak is more strictly “crack[ing] down” on respoolers. So, why is Kodak forfeiting the extra money made by selling to brands like Reflx Lab?
Reflx Lab describes itself as a photographic film and camera accessories company that is “dedicated to creating innovative products that stand out in the market.” Some of its most popular products are its 35mm film stocks and of those, its respooled Kodak cinema stocks are beloved for their color rendition as well as their approachable price. Unfortunately for fans of this combination of factors, that appears slated to be coming to an end. 
Author’s Note: It should be known that PetaPixel isn’t speaking for Kodak in this case — the explanations and speculation provided here is based on multiple conversations with industry experts over the last four months. As should be expected, it’s a delicate, nuanced situation.
Before getting into the situation at Reflx Lab, it is important to explain the situation quickly. The problem from Kodak’s perspective isn’t that its motion picture film is being respooled but rather how the respooler is acquiring said film. Kodak sells its motion picture film at two price points: one is for filmmakers who get a better deal because that industry is more susceptible to pricing changes and if the film price is too high, those filmmakers and studios may elect not to use film at all, which then would mean it is entirely possible that Kodak will no longer have enough volume to justify the price of production. In order to continue to allow filmmakers to keep using film, it is supporting the industry by keeping costs as low as possible. 
For companies who want to sell this motion picture film for the purposes of still photography — respoolers — Kodak charges more, likely to offset the cost of producing it for motion pictures (the intended purpose of the stock) and also to bolster the health of its overall business. 
Some companies are acquiring Kodak motion picture stock to respool but doing so without informing Kodak of that intended purpose, instead saying it is going to be used to produce movies. These companies are receiving the motion picture discount price and using that price difference to sell the respooled film at a lower price. 
Kodak is trying to balance this problem by working to keep its motion picture film accessible while at the same time trying to prevent third parties from taking advantage. As a result, it is now cutting off access to suppliers that it believes were less than truthful about the intended use of that motion picture film stock.
“Over the past year, Kodak has implemented a policy restricting the sale of bulk rolls of motion picture film to individuals or companies that cannot prove the film will be used for shooting movies,” Reflx Lab writes in a blog post published yesterday. 
“Kodak claims this change is a response to the growing trend of small businesses reselling respooled film—motion picture film repackaged into 135 film canisters for still photography. Ironically, the roots of 135 film itself trace back to 1895, when William Kennedy Laurie Dickson cut and respooled 70mm cinema stock to create the first 135-format film. This decision by Kodak raises significant concerns for the film photography community and threatens the innovation and creativity that independent photographers and small businesses contribute.”
Reflx Lab says that respooled motion picture film is loved for its color, tonal range, and film grain and as a result, these film stocks are highly prized by analog photographers. 
“The demand for unique film formats—particularly those unavailable through mainstream manufacturers—has fostered a creative ecosystem where independent businesses and film enthusiasts collaborate symbiotically. For example, Reflx Lab bulk-loads Kodak Vision3 and Aerocolor film into 220 rolls, reviving a format abandoned decades ago and meeting the needs of film photographers who value shooting capacity. Reflx Lab also produces 127 color film, resurrecting another long-discontinued format that allows people to use heirloom cameras such as the Kodak Vest Pocket, the first 127 film camera. Kodak’s restrictions jeopardize not only the livelihoods of these small entrepreneurs but also the cultural and artistic richness of the film photography world,” Reflx Lab says. 
Kodak’s stated concern for restricting access to these film stocks is that it undermines the company’s core business of selling motion picture and still photography film. Kodak likely sees respoolers as direct competitors for its own products — that is, at least, Reflx Lab’s feeling. 
“Respoolers purchase bulk rolls from Kodak, which generates significant revenue, especially as demand for respooled film increases. Without these sales, Kodak forfeits that income entirely. If Kodak retains the film for direct consumer sales and maintains high prices, the market may not absorb the stock, resulting in diminished profits. Simply put, consumers drawn to respooled Vision3 and 5294 Ektarchrome are unlikely to transition fully to Kodak’s still film. They may just shoot digital or black and white film.”
Looking at it from Reflx Lab’s perspective, its stance sounds completely reasonable. But from where Kodak stands, there are issues with what Reflx Lab is doing. 
Photographers should understand the differences between taking what is a singular product and selling it for different rates — think, photo licensing. Licensing an image for non-commercial use (personal/educational/editorial/entertainment/artistic) is worth much less than doing so for commercial or retail use. Just because a photographer sells a photo to a family to display in their home doesn’t give them the right to then use that photo to advertise their business or reproduce it and sell it for a higher price. This is especially the case if the photographer is retaining the rights to sell those photos as a stock photo, which would then put the client and the photographer directly in competition with one another. 
This is especially the case if the photographer is retaining the right to sell stock photos commercially and reproduce those photos themselves, or granting those rights to another client at a premium.
Kodak’s stance is, therefore, likely one of intellectual property protection. To understand this, it’s better to use another metaphor: a brewery. If a brewery were to sell discounted kegs of beer for events — beer that is only sold in kegs to special clients — which were intended to support the local culture and increase brand awareness, it would not be happy to find that the beer it was selling was getting repackaged into cans or bottles and sold as new craft beer. It would be even worse if this was done by leveraging that brewery’s brand and marketing, calling the newly repackaged beer one that was done “in the style of” the brewery from which it was taken. 
Since a business can’t copyright physical goods, they can instead can choose who they sell to and enforce their trademarks to protect the value of the goods they produce. In a free market, you have the right to sell to whomever you choose, and the right to not sell to anyone of your choosing. No one is entitled to any of it. 
This leads directly into the discussion of where respooled Kodak motion picture film can be purchased, because Kodak isn’t cutting everyone off. If a brand continues to sell respooled film, it’s likely because they have an established, honest relationship with Kodak which allows them to continue. One of those brands is Cinestill. 
“We do not respool film that has been packaged and produced for motion picture use. We legitimately source our materials at a premium — disclosing the intended use — to support the continued sustainability of film manufacturing. We have always been honest and transparent about the intended use of the materials that we source in order to collaborate to produce the highest quality products to fuel the analog renaissance. We are proud to support and contribute to both the analog photography community and the core manufacturers who make film photography possible,” Steve Carter, head of marketing and outreach at Cinestill tells PetaPixel. 
As a result, there is no interruption in the availability of Cinestill film production. 
Photographers are going to hate this because, on the surface, it just looks like something they like at a price they like is being taken away from them. Plenty of people will mostly just be upset that they can’t get what they want for the prices they want to pay. And I get it, that stinks. Shooting film is already expensive, and anything that makes it less accessible, even if we’re it’s only a matter of a few dollars, is a bummer. It doesn’t help that because Kodak Alaris was bought by Kingswood Capital Management last year, it looks like —  yet again — a private equity firm is trying to squeeze all the value they can out of a business. 
Reflx Lab’s long, impassioned blog post speaks directly to this, making it sound like the victim of a gross, greedy company that’s trying to keep film out of the hands of photographers. To quote it directly again, “This decision by Kodak raises significant concerns for the film photography community and threatens the innovation and creativity that independent photographers and small businesses contribute.”
Questions on what is innovative or creative about respooling existing film aside, the point remains that if a business is honest about what it intends to use something for, it affects the value. Much like a company selling something for “educational use only” at a lower price, it is perfectly fair for companies to choose to sell things for a specific industrial use or for resale at different prices than they would for retail. Some pricing strategies may have just enough margin to keep the lights on and the equipment running, while others may help afford payroll for entire departments. If a business is honest about the intended use when sourcing something it may end up costing more but that business maintains a good relationship with their supplier in exchange. 
If a business isn’t honest about that use and leverages that to obtain a price advantage in the market, they might do so but eventually suppliers won’t want to sell to them anymore and instead choose those customers who are using the products as intended or paying a higher price based on use or exclusivity.
“…the respooled film market does not undermine its core business of selling motion picture and still photography film,” Reflx Lab says. “Respoolers purchase bulk rolls from Kodak, which generates significant revenue, especially as demand for respooled film increases. Without these sales, Kodak forfeits that income entirely.” 
This ignores a major factor: what if Kodak sells its film that is designed to be used for motion pictures at a reduced rate because raising the price would upset filmmakers, decreasing the volume ordered by them and therefore decreasing volume to the degree that it could no longer be made? And if people only bought repackaged 100D motion picture film — rather than E100 for still photography — there may not be enough profit to justify making it. 
Reflx Labs says it is doing its best “to maintain our film inventory and avoid price increases,” which sounds as though it does not want to pay for the increased cost of officially licensing Kodak motion picture film for respooling — either that or it isn’t being given the option by Kodak. That should tell you all you need to know about how the company has been acquiring the motion picture stock and why it has upset Kodak.

Altria (NYSE: MO) recently reported its Q4 results, with revenues and earnings slightly ahead of the street estimates. The company reported revenue of $5.11 billion and adjusted earnings of $1.29 per share, compared to the consensus estimates of $5.05 billion and $1.28, respectively. The company continued to benefit from increasing sales of oral tobacco products. However, the company’s outlook for 2025 was below expectations.
MO stock, with 41% returns since the beginning of 2024, has outperformed the S&P 500 index, up 27%. This can be attributed to the company’s decision to reduce its stake in Anheuser-Busch InBev last year and use the proceeds to buy back its own shares. But, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception.
Altria’s revenues of $5.11 billion in Q4 reflected a 1.6% y-o-y growth. Altria continues to benefit from its relatively new smoke-free products, including NJOY and on! Total smokeable products volume declined 8.6% and oral tobacco products volume was down 0.4% during the quarter. NJOY – which includes vaping products and electronic cigarettes – saw a solid 15.3% y-o-y volume growth for consumables and 22.2% jump in volume of devices.
Although Altria saw only a low single-digit sales growth, its adjusted operating margin has improved by 220 bps for its smokeable products and 640 bps for its oral tobacco products in Q4. Higher revenues and margin expansion resulted in the bottom line of $1.29 on an adjusted basis, reflecting a 9.3% y-o-y change.
Looking forward, Altria expects its 2025 adjusted earnings to be $5.30 at the mid-point of the provided range, missing the consensus estimate of $5.35. Furthermore, the company’s management pointed that there’s a rise in illicit vaping products in the market, which is impacting their business. Illicit products now account for 60% of the vaping products market, creating an uneven playing field for Altria’s compliant businesses operating within federal guidelines.
Although Altria posted an upbeat Q4, its stock hasn’t seen any meaningful change lately. But, if we look at a slightly longer time frame, the increase in MO stock over the last four-year period has been far from consistent and has largely been as volatile as the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 24% in 2021, 4% in 2022, -4% in 2023, and 41% in 2024.
In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
In light of the uncertain economic landscape, including questions about rate cuts and new tariffs affecting major trading partners (Canada, Mexico, and China), will MO repeat its pattern of underperforming against the S&P 500 as seen in 2021 and 2023, or could we expect a rebound? While we will soon update our model for Altria to reflect the latest results, we think its stock is fairly priced now. At its current levels of $52, MO stock is trading at 10.2x its trailing earnings of $5.12 per share, slightly above the stock’s average P/E ratio of 9.5x over the last five years.
While MO stock looks like it is fully valued, it is helpful to see how Altria’s peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

34,2025-02-04,"Robinhood (HOOD), the financial services company, is rolling back plans to allow its customers to invest in event contracts tied to the outcome of this weekend’s Super Bowl.
According to the company, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has formally requested Robinhood to “not permit customers to access” sports event contracts. 
Robinhood said its going to work with the CFTC to understand its concerns. 
“We are disappointed by this outcome, especially given that we had been in regular communication with the CFTC about our intent and plans to offer this product,” the company said in a statement. “We’ve also taken steps to advocate for balanced regulation in the futures and derivatives markets, including participating directly in a CFTC roundtable, providing written feedback to the CFTC, and generally championing the economic benefits of event contracts.” 
The news come just a day after Robinhood launched its “Pro Football Championship Market,” which essentially allowed its customers to bet on whether they think the Kansas City Chiefs or the  Philadelphia Eagles will win the Super Bowl on Sunday by buying event contracts. 
Robinhood allowed its users to buy one of two contracts based on their prediction for who would win the game. “Event contracts then pay out if the position held matches the correct outcome of the event; otherwise, they expire worthless,” according to the company’s help center.
Robinhood said the product was rolled out to about 1% of its customers. For users who already bought contracts, Robinhood will give them option to “close their positions or take them to resolution.”
Robinhood previously allowed users to trade event contracts based on the outcome of the U.S. presidential election.

35,2025-02-04,"On February 3 President Donald Trump halted the most predictable stock market drop in human history by agreeing to delay by one month a 25 percent tariff on Mexico and Canada. Yesterday, I wrote that Trump was so hell-bent on trying to replace the income tax with tariff revenue that nothing but oligarchs paying extortion through massive Trump memecoin purchases could deter him. But it turns out that a thousand-point drop in the S&P 500—and perhaps last week’s $10 billion sell-off of $TRUMP and $MELANIA, the memecoins in question—worked just as well.
Before proceeding, let me reaffirm that Trump’s governing tool kit includes extortion. Trump’s inaugural committee, which raised a reported $250 million, was a massive extortion racket. So are Trump’s legal actions against various news organizations and social media companies, which he’s settling on terms that are remarkably favorable considering the weakness of his claims. The 40 “whales” (i.e., large investors) whom Business Insider reported in January to own 94 percent of Trump’s worthless memecoins, in increments each exceeding $10 million, surely expect something in return for enriching the president personally. We don’t know who they are because for some bizarre reason these people are permitted to keep their identities secret. 
But today, at least, the Mexican and Canadian tariffs are on hold, and the only logical explanation why is Trump’s infantile incapacity to grasp the mechanics of cause and effect. You tell him not to look directly at an eclipse because it’s bad for your eyes, and he looks directly at the eclipse (three times!). You tell him not to slap 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico because the markets will crater, and he does it anyway. 
Our best guide to Trump’s pullback Monday is not tariff policy, nor economic policy generally, but the child development theory of the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. From the ages of 2 to 7, Piaget explained, a child is unable to identify cause and effect logically and instead engages in transductive reasoning. A child might believe, for instance, that his taking a nap causes it to be afternoon, when in fact it being afternoon is what causes his parent to put him down for a nap. 
Most of us grow out of the transductive phase. Trump did not, making it difficult to distinguish his lies from his delusions. Physical exercise makes you die young. Windmills kill whales. DEI caused last week’s fatal collision in Washington, D.C., between an Army helicopter and a passenger plane. 
Because Trump’s reasoning is transductive, he was incapable of seeing the perfectly obvious link between his tariff policies and a stock market plunge until he actually witnessed it. He then proceeded to forge a transductive link between Mexico President Claudia Scheinbaum Pardo sending 10,000 National Guard troops to the border (which, as TNR’s Malcolm Ferguson points out, was an unexceptional concession) and his own tariff delay—when really that delay was Trump’s panicky response to a tanking stock market. A few hours later Trump did the same with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s pledge to halt a (mostly imaginary) flow of fentanyl from Canada into the United States. 
If Trump were a rational actor, he would learn from witnessing Monday’s market drop not to do anything to cause a similar drop in the future. But Trump isn’t rational, so we may see him go through this exercise again if he decides to impose the Canada and Mexico tariffs one month from now, or if he proceeds with his threatened tariffs against the European Union. 
Before Friday, the stock market couldn’t bring itself to believe that Trump’s tariff threats were real, because the proposals were so unbelievably stupid on their face (and also, maybe, because we’d already seen Trump back quietly away, at least for now, from his 10 percent across-the-board tariff on all foreign goods). Whether the stock market will soon revert to believing once again in a rational Trump is an open question because financial markets are no stranger to transductive reasoning. 
The rest of us, though, are learning that Trump is more of a truculent toddler than he was during his first term, and that his grasp even of his own rational self-interest is not what it was. We search in vain for a game plan. I’m starting to believe not even his handlers possess much of one. As the fox says in Lars von Trier’s Antichrist (2009): Chaos reigns.

Apple Samsung Xiaomi Oppo OnePlus vivo Honor Huawei Tecno Infinix

Smartphone sales grew 7% in 2024 compared to 2023, reaching 1.22 billion units, marking a rebound after two consecutive years of decline, according to Canalys' latest report.
Apple and Samsung were tied in the lead with 18% of the market each, Canalys says, followed by Xiaomi with 14%, Transsion with 9%, Oppo with 8%, vivo with 8%, Honor and Lenovo with 5% each, and Huawei and Realme with 4% each.
Apple's performance was down to ""emerging market growth and stable performances in North America and Europe"", while Xiaomi was ""driven by strong momentum in Mainland China and continued strategic expansion into emerging markets"".
Apple sold 225.9 million iPhones in 2024 (down 1% from 2023), Samsung sold 222.9 million Galaxy smartphones (also down by 1%), Xiaomi sold 168.6 million units (growing 15%), Transsion sold 106.7 million (growing 15%) and Oppo (including OnePlus) sold 103.6 million (growing 3%). In terms of overall smartphone sales, Mainland China grew 4% compared to 2023, North America grew 1%, and Europe grew 3%.
If we look at just the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple led with 77.1 million shipments and 23% market share (down 1% in volume, down from 24% in Q4 2023), followed by Samsung with 51.9 million units and 16% of the pie (down 3% in volume, down from 17% market share YoY), Xiaomi with 42.7 million shipments and 13% share (up 5% in volume, static share), Transsion with 27.2 million units shipped for 8% of the pie (down 4% in volume and down from 9% in market share YoY), and vivo with 26.4 million units and 8% share (up 10% in volume and up from 7% in share).

I'm not sure why people always champion Huawei as if it's the peak of Chinese phones. Huawei phones have always had poor price to performance even before the sanction days, Xiaomi and Oppo/Oneplus were the best and still is the best. 

Not under the ""Huawei"" brand, but maybe under the Honor brand.
Apple is winner.

39,2025-02-04,"Don't let Samsung or Apple fool you: 2025's phones are awesome. 

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

It's easy to think that the best phones in 2025 are growing stale. The product category has matured over the past two decades, and many updates are incremental. For instance, the newest Samsung Galaxy S25 series looks like the Galaxy S24 lineup with a few tweaks. Similar things can be said about the latest iPhones and newest Pixels, to a lesser degree.
In fact, Android Central's resident phone expert, Nicholas Sutrich, previewed the market for smartphones in 2025 at the end of last year with an outlook that could be described as depressing. He's right. For most phone buyers in North America, this year will be just like the last one — filled with incremental updates, rising prices, and little variety.
Here's the thing: it doesn't have to be this way. Smartphone buyers in the U.S. specifically silo themselves when buying their handsets, often sticking to a handful of mobile carriers and even fewer phone brands. It's a phenomenon that seems to only exist in North America.
Put simply, buying smartphones through carrier contracts is a bad idea. It limits your options, restricts your flexibility, and can end up costing you more in the long run. It's easy to see how.
Samsung routinely offers boosted trade-in values for phones, but you can't take advantage of them unless your phone is paid off. Want to pay your phone off early to maximize your trade-in value? You'll likely lose all the discounts and promotions you got when you bought your current phone from your carrier.
A similar situation occurs if you break your phone and don't have insurance. Say your phone is too damaged to fix and you need a new one — you could be hit with a massive bill that includes the amount needed to pay off your current phone, plus the price of a new one and any carrier fees that apply.
Those are just a few reasons that you might want to consider buying a phone outright in 2025 rather than purchasing it from a mobile network provider — like AT&T, T-Mobile, or Verizon. But there are other reasons, like the availability of more phone brands and models beyond what you see in your carrier stores. Based on what I've seen from the phone market in late 2024 and early 2025, there are lots of exciting and fun smartphones available if you look beyond the restrictions imposed by carriers.
Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android
The OnePlus 13 and OnePlus 13R are two great phones to start with because they're sensible options. The OnePlus 13 is a $900 phone with hardware that can match or beat the $1,299 Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, which is pretty exciting to me. On top of that, the phone has IP68 and IP69 protection against dust and water ingress. In other words, you can stick the OnePlus 13 in a dishwasher, and it should survive (though we don't recommend you try it).
The OnePlus 13 isn't the only phone in 2025 that can survive a dishwasher run. The Honor Magic 7 Pro is dishwasher-safe as well, and I saw it used as a cutting board, too. If that isn't fun, I honestly don't know what is.
Back to the sensible nature of this section, it's hard to forget the OnePlus 13R. It delivers flagship specs for $600, and that's downright cool. I think there are many people in North America that have been conditioned by Apple and Samsung to think that flagships have to cost $1,000 or above. In 2025, that couldn't be more wrong. There has never been a time when $500 or $600 could get you more in a smartphone.
As a phone reviewer, I often test out a variety of review units each year. But I also buy way too many phones and other gadgets with my own money, and I've never been more conflicted about which one to buy. The OnePlus 13 is the sensible option, like I said, although there are many others that fit the ""fun"" bill better.
One of those devices is the ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro. It came to the U.S. in January and is simply a beastly and unique gaming phone. The ROG Phone 9 Pro has a loud design with nods to ASUS' gaming aesthetic, but things really get crazy with ""Anime Vision."" That's what ASUS calls the LED display on the back of ROG Phone 9 Pro, which includes 648 individual white and red LEDs.
You can put logos, text, and other designs on the back of your smartphone with the ROG Phone 9 Pro. If you're not impressed yet, the ROG Phone 9 Pro's back LED display can actually be used to play retro-style mini-games and show your phone's battery percentage. From a hardware perspective, the ROG Phone 9 Pro has a 3.5mm headphone jack and two USB-C ports designed to connect to accessories like controllers or a cooling fan.
Seriously, anyone who thinks phones aren't fun nowadays isn't looking hard enough. The ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro is one of the most fun devices I've ever seen, and I might pay over $1,000 just to get my hands on one.
Finally, I think it's worth emphasizing how much flair and customization can be added to phones, especially those sold outside the U.S. For example, the TECNO Spark 30 Bumblebee Edition is designed like a Transformer, which is insanely cool for robot nerds like myself. If superheroes are more your style, there's the Poco X7 Pro Iron Man edition, which needs no introduction.
No matter what kind of smartphone buyer you are, there's a ""fun"" device for you in 2025. Like a super durable smartphone? The OnePlus 13 is right for you. Need a flagship on a budget? Don't count out the OnePlus 13R. Want a phone so cool it gets into ludicrous hardware territory? That's the ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro, plain and simple. Want to express your fandoms without a case or skin? The Bumblebee or Iron Man phones are insanely neat.
It's true that the best Android phones from brands like Samsung or Google can get boring. However, it would be a mistake to limit yourself to those companies or to whatever your cellular carrier offers. There's a whole lot of phones out there, and they're more fun than ever.

Asian equities rebounded, and tariff talk became more bark than bite for Canada and Mexico as the U.S. dollar fell.
Hong Kong stocks rose on optimism that a Trump-Xi phone call would lead to a similar deal, though that failed to materialize by midnight (noon local time), indicating U.S. 10% tariffs would be implemented, which sent stocks lower. For the first time in a long time, against a clear negative with the media banging the doomsday drum, Hong Kong stocks rose. They rose on good volumes that were 118% of the 1-year average, even without Southbound Stock Connect, which remains closed and usually accounts for 40% of Hong Kong volume.
No matter what the nattering nabobs of negative say today, all you need to look at is CNH, China’s offshore traded currency, which appreciated overnight versus the U.S. dollar. Below is the China response, which was fairly muted.
Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council starting on February 10:
Ministry of Commerce:
China also filed a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization against the U.S. for enacting the recent tariffs.
The State Administration for Market Regulation reported that Alphabet is suspected of violating China’s anti-monopoly law and will be investigated.
Hong Kong exhibited high volumes, good breadth/advancers versus decliners led by growth stocks as Hong Kong’s most heavily traded by value were Tencent, up +4.11% on volume almost 50% higher than average, Alibaba, up +3.88% on volume almost 100% higher than average, and Meituan, up +5.97% on volume 136% of the average.
One interesting item I noticed was the Ministry of Commerce release stating that from January 20th to February 4th, 14.7 million consumers utilized the trade-in subsidy to buy 18.8 million mobile phones. It seems positive to me!
Baidu gained +3.43% after it announced that Baidu Intelligent Cloud integrated DeepSeek’s R1 and V3 models.
FTSE A50 futures are surprisingly barely higher than their pre-holiday close.
Only in time, and in hindsight, will the true impact of last Monday’s DeepSeek announcement become known. One definitive takeaway is how many popular and crowded US investment themes are. Semiconductors, nuclear, data centers, and technology all swooned simultaneously. Having witnessed the public equity consequence of DeepSeek, one has to wonder about the consequence on private equity as the open-source nature of DeepSeek must be most disconcerting. As Alibaba proved, there are multiple Large Language Models in China, proving the previous administration’s efforts to “hobble” China’s economy and technology sector failed. The U.S.-China geopolitical narrative is keeping many CFAs and MBAs from doing what they know they should be doing, which is buying low and selling high. Will a Trump-Xi phone call lead to a U.S.-China trip and/or summit? Last Monday has the potential to be a significant market moment, though time will tell.
The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech indexes gained +2.83% and +5.06%, respectively, on volume up +29.55% from yesterday, which is 118% of the 1-year average. 363 stocks advanced, while 128 stocks declined. Main Board short turnover increased by +42.92% from yesterday, which is 143% of the 1-year average, as 18% of turnover was short turnover (Hong Kong short turnover includes ETF short volume, which is driven by market makers’ ETF hedging). The growth factor and large capitalization stocks outperformed the value factor and small capitalization stocks. All sectors were positive, led by Consumer Discretionary, which gained +4.94%, Information Technology, which gained +4.45%, and Communication Services, which gained +3.63%. The top-performing subsectors were consumer durables, apparel, semiconductors, and autos. Meanwhile, the chemical industry, commercial & professional services, and environmental protection were among the worst-performing subsectors. Southbound Stock Connect was closed.
Shanghai, Shenzhen, and the STAR Board were closed.

Nintendo is preparing countermeasures against resellers for the Switch 2 launch.
By 
    Darryn Bonthuys
   on February 4, 2025 at 7:30AM PST
With the Switch 2 launching this year, Nintendo has confirmed that it is preparing to prevent scalpers from negatively impacting the release of its hybrid console. In a press conference, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said that the company would take all ""possible measures"" for the Switch 2 to produce enough stock to meet demand.
""We will take all possible measures based on the experience we have accumulated to date,"" Furukawa said to Nikkei (via VGC). ""We are making preparations.""

While the Switch was popular when it first launched in 2017 and stock did sell quickly, it wasn't until the COVID pandemic that demand quickly outpaced supply. Combined with the global semiconductor shortage at the time, the Switch became a sought-after item at the start of 2020, with resellers using the opportunity to buy up available stock and make a profit.
Scalpers were a major issue for Microsoft and Sony as well, as the late-2020 launch of the Xbox Series X|S and PS5 consoles saw chronic shortages thanks to resellers using bots to grab all of the consoles whenever a resupply came in through online marketplaces.
Furukawa had previously mentioned that Nintendo's strategy for dealing with scalpers revolves around a healthy supply of Switch 2 consoles for its official launch this year. ""As a countermeasure against resale, we believe that the most important thing is to produce a sufficient number to meet customer demand, and this idea has not changed since last year,"" Furukawa said in 2024.
More details on the Switch 2 will be revealed in a Nintendo Direct scheduled for April, and for anyone looking to go hands-on with the device, you can do so at the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 Experience.

42,2025-02-04,"The company is going ahead strongly with AI projects. 

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Alphabet, Google's parent company, announced a 12% revenue increase year-over-year to $96.47 billion in Q4 2024. The company's revenue at the end of its fiscal year totaled $350 billion, a 14% increase year-over-year.
The company's shares fell nearly 7% after the trading day Tuesday.
Operating income was $30.97 billion, up from $23.69 billion in the same period last year. Net income was reported at $26.53 billion, up from $20.68 billion in the same period from the previous year. Google Service's revenues increased to $84.1 billion in the quarter, a 10% increase from the same period a year ago. The company said this is a reflection of ""strong momentum across Google Search & other and YouTube ads.""
The company’s CEO, Sundar Pichai, said in the earnings statement that the quarter was strong ""driven by our leadership in AI and the momentum across the business.""
""We are building, testing, and launching products and models faster than ever, and making significant progress in compute and driving efficients,"" he said.
""In Search, advances like AI Overviews and Circle to Search are increasing user engagement. Our AI-powered Google Cloud portfolio is seeing stronger customer demand, and YouTube continues to be the leader in streaming watchtime and podcasts.""
According to a report from Investopedia, Bank of America analysts told clients that based on Meta's strong results last week (where most of its plans were on AI spending), Alphabet also has positive momentum.

Analysts from BoA and Raymond James indicate that because of the boom of DeepSeek, Google may ""push the tech giant to act with greater urgency on AI developments.""
Pichai did not respond directly to the increase of interest in DeepSeek or its launch but addressed that Google has been working hard to push development on its AI.
""I think, you know, part of the reason we are so excited about the AI opportunity is we know we can drive extraordinary use cases because the cost of actually using it is going to keep coming down, which will make more use cases feasible. And that's the opportunity space, you know, it's as big as it comes. And that's why you're seeing us invest to meet that moment,"" he noted during the earnings call.
An email from Investing.com indicated the company saw a shortfall in its earnings ""driven by slower Google Cloud growth,"" which highlights the ""challenges of scaling its enterprise business amid fierce competition from Amazon's AWS and Microsoft's Azure.""
While the company has been pushing forward with AI investments, the drop in the market after hours ""reflects investor disappointment.""
""The street is demanding clearer timelines on when AI spending translates to earnings and sales growth, not just promises. The reaction underscores concerns that rivals like Microsoft, with its OpenAI partnership, are better positioned to convert AI hype into revenue. For Alphabet to reassure investors, it needs to demonstrate that its AI bets, from Gemini models to Workspace integrations, can reignite Cloud momentum while core advertising remains stable in an uncertain economy,"" the note read.
When asked how AI can be monetized in the future, Pichai indicated that the company has very good ideas for native ad concepts and will give people options over time, but that this year, Google will stay focused on the subscription direction.

43,2025-02-04,"While Nvidia stock has dropped off IBD Leaderboard, Meta and Google show strength as Trump tariffs rattle the market."
44,2025-02-04,"OTTAWA, ONTARIO, CANADA - 2025/01/29: In this photo illustration, the Baidu, Inc. logo is seen ... [+] displayed on a smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)
Chinese search engine behemoth Baidu’s stock (NASDAQ: BIDU) stock has been a laggard over the past year, declining by about 20% since the start of 2024. A couple of trends have impacted the stock. Firstly, China’s post-Covid-19 economic rebound has been weaker than expected. The real estate crisis has driven down home prices, eroding household wealth and consumer confidence, while youth unemployment remains high. These factors have weighed on domestic consumption impacting Baidu’s core search business. As businesses cut marketing budgets, ad sales on Baidu’s search platforms have slowed, particularly in key categories such as e-commerce, real estate, and travel. In Q3 2024, Baidu’s revenue fell by 3% year-over-year to $4.78 billion, while adjusted earnings declined by around 19% to $2.37 per share.
There are also concerns about the impact of AI on Baidu’s search operations. While Baidu has been investing considerably in AI with tools such as its Ernie chatbot, it may have to figure out competent monetization strategies, since the technology deployed at the moment has less scope for advertisements. Moreover, AI-powered chatbots could disrupt traditional search as users seek direct answers rather than clicking through search results and ads. The competition for search could also become more intese, as Chinese tech players such as Alibaba and Tencent are developing competing large language models, which could challenge Baidu’s position in the search market.
Notably, BIDU stock has performed worse than the broader market in each of the last 4 years Returns for the stock were -31% in 2021, -23% in 2022, 4% in 2023, and -29% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
 Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could BIDU face a similar situation as it did in 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a recovery?
There are positives for Baidu. The Chinese government appears more committed to economic stimulus measures to revive growth, signaling a shift toward looser monetary policy and more active fiscal spending in recent months. Meanwhile, China’s AI sector has gained momentum, with the latest DeepSeek AI model, which was recently unveiled, surprising the tech world by offering close to ChatGPT levels of performance while claiming to use considerably lower computing power. China’s strong AI capabilities are also likely to draw more interest from investors, following the unveiling of the DeepSeek AI model last month. DeepSeek promises ChatGPT-level performance with a fraction of the cost and computing power. Baidu, with its advancements in AI such as including Ernie Bot and self-driving technology has made considerable progress in the field. As one of the few publicly listed plays on China’s AI sector, Baidu could benefit from higher investments.
At around $90 per share, we see Baidu as fairly valued. The stock trades at roughly 9x consensus 2025 earnings, well below the nearly 40x multiple it commanded during the Covid-19 pandemic. Additionally, Baidu held nearly $21 billion in cash at the end of Q3 2024, with debt of about $9 billion, giving it a net cash position of $12 billion. That’s approximately 40% of its current market cap. Excluding the cash position, Baidu stock trades at just about 6x forward earnings, which is very reasonable. See our analysis of Baidu Revenue and Baidu Valuation for more details on how the company’s revenues are trending and how its valuation compares with peers.

Miami Heat star Jimmy Butler reportedly isn't generating much interest on the trade market ahead of Thursday's NBA trade deadline.
According to ESPN's Tim Bontemps, ""there isn't a lot of interest"" in Butler outside of the Phoenix Suns, who are struggling to find a way to make room for him.
Bontemps noted that the Suns are handcuffed by Bradley Beal, who has a $50.2 million salary and a no-trade clause. Until and unless the Suns can find a landing spot for Beal, they are unable to accommodate Butler.
ESPN's Brian Windhorst added that the Suns are hard at work in terms of figuring out a solution, going so far as to propose three-, four- and even five-team deals.
Per Windhorst, the Heat are ""very motivated"" to move Butler. However, Bontemps pointed out that the few interested teams outside of the Suns have been informed that Butler would prefer not to play for them.
If the Heat are ultimately unable to get a deal done with the Suns, Windhorst suggested that Miami could circle back to the Golden State Warriors as a landing spot.
Windhorst reported Monday that Butler informed the Warriors he would not sign a contract extension with them should they trade for him, meaning he would likely be a rental should Golden State acquire him.
Butler has a player option in his contract for next season, meaning he can either opt in at a salary of $52.4 million or opt out and become a free agent.
Over the past month, the Heat have suspended Butler on three separate occasions, which speaks to the disconnect between the team and player.
The first suspension was a seven-game ban for conduct detrimental to the team after Butler publicly suggested that he wanted to be traded. As part of that suspension announcement, the Heat noted that they would listen to trade offers for Butler.
Butler was later suspended two games for missing a team flight, and he is now in the midst of an indefinite suspension for walking out of practice.
The 35-year-old Butler is a six-time All-Star who has spent the past six seasons with the Heat after stints with the Chicago Bulls, Minnesota Timberwolves and Philadelphia 76ers.
Butler has twice led the Heat to the NBA Finals, averaging 21.0 points per game in 316 regular-season games with the Heat and 24.7 points per game in 64 playoff games with Miami.
Over 25 games this season, Butler is averaging 17.0 points, 5.2 rebounds and 4.8 assists per contest while shooting 54.0 percent from the field.
Given his experience, skill set and history of playoff success, Butler would potentially be a huge addition for any contending team this season.
A great deal of drama has surrounded Butler this season, though, which could be part of the reason why teams are reluctant to trade for him.
From Miami's perspective, the issues between Butler and the organization seem irreparable at this point, so one can only assume that the Heat will go to great lengths to move him if there is any opportunity to make it happen."

The prolonged free agency for Pete Alonso and Alex Bregman is having ripple effects on the entire market right now.
Per The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal, Justin Turner and Yoán Moncada are among the notable free-agent position players ""on hold"" waiting for Alonso and Bregman to sign.
Trying to figure out the market for Alonso and Bregman is proving to be one of the most difficult tasks this offseason. Alonso reportedly rejected a three-year, $70 million offer from the New York Mets that has been described as a ""last-ditch effort"" by the club to bring him back to Queens.
There have been conflicting reports about a potential agreement between Alonso and the Toronto Blue Jays. MLB Network's Jon Heyman reported on Jan. 23 the Blue Jays were ""still working hard [and] trying"" to sign Alonso.
However, Shi Davidi and Ben Nicholson-Smith of SportsNet noted that same day talks between Alonso and the Blue Jays was ""not gaining momentum.""
Bregman's market has been all over the place. It seemed like a sure thing he was leaving the Houston Astros after they acquired Isaac Paredes to play third base as part of the trade with the Chicago Cubs for Kyle Tucker.
The Detroit Tigers have been hanging around the Bregman talks. The Chicago Cubs and Boston Red Sox were mentioned as potential landing spots for the two-time All-Star at points this offseason.
Given how long things have been dragging out, the Astros came back into the equation then seemingly fell out again with general manager Dana Brown saying on Tuesday they ""lost' the star third baseman and spoke of him in the past tense during a media luncheon.
Players like Turner and Moncada, who are corner infielder/DH types, will struggle to get a lot of interest from potential playoff contenders that might be in the market for either or both of Alonso and Bregman.
All 30 teams are reporting for their first spring training workouts next week. It wouldn't be a surprise if there's no resolution to the situation for all of these players before then."

Colgate-Palmolive stock (NYSE: CL) recently reported its Q4 results, with revenues missing and earnings slightly ahead of the street estimates. The company reported revenue of $4.94 billion and adjusted earnings of $0.91 per share, compared to the consensus estimates of $4.99 billion and $0.89, respectively. The company benefited from an uptick in Europe and Asia Pacific sales. However, its outlook for 2025 was below the expectations, resulting in a 5% fall in CL stock price post the results announcement.
CL stock, with 12% returns since the beginning of 2024, has underperformed the S&P 500 index, up 27%. The strengthening of the U.S. Dollar has weighed on the company’s performance lately. If you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception.
Colgate-Palmolive’s revenues are reported under two segments – Oral, Personal, & Home Care, and Hill’s Pet Nutrition. These segments accounted for 78% and 22% of the total sales in 2024, respectively. The company’s top-line of $4.94 billion in Q4 reflected a 0.1% decline on a reported basis and a 4.3% growth on an organic basis. It saw a 2.5% rise in volumes and 1.8% pricing gains, more than offset by 4.4% forex headwinds.
Colgate-Palmolive saw its gross margin expand by 70 bps y-o-y to 60.3% in Q4. This helped the company post a bottom line of $0.91 per share on an adjusted basis, reflecting a 5% y-o-y growth. Looking forward, the company expects its organic sales to rise between 3% and 5% and a low to mid-single-digits growth in adjusted earnings in 2025.
Much of the company’s recent financial performance as well as the underwhelming outlook, can be attributed to the currency headwinds. Latin American currencies in particular have seen a meaningful impact on the company’s sales. FX accounted for a -16.4% contribution to Latin America’s sales, which otherwise saw a good 9.2% organic sales growth.
Amid a miss on the top-line in Q4 and downbeat guidance for 2025, CL stock trended lower post the results announcement. Even if we look at a slightly longer period, the changes in CL stock over the last four-year period have been far from consistent, although annual returns were considerably less volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 2% in 2021, -5% in 2022, 4% in 2023, and 17% in 2024.
The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
As markets grapple with uncertainty surrounding interest rate policies and newly imposed tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China, is CL likely to mirror its underperformance versus the S&P 500 from 2021, 2023, and 2024 this year, or are we positioned for a significant upswing? While we will soon update our model for CL to reflect the latest results, we think after its recent fall, CL stock offers some room for growth. At its current levels of $87, CL stock trades at a little under 24x trailing earnings of $3.60 per share, lower than the stock’s average P/E ratio of 26x over the last five years. Despite ongoing foreign exchange pressures, the company’s market dominance remains intact. Given the positive trends in volume and sustained pricing power, a lower valuation multiple seems unwarranted.
While CL stock looks like it has some room for growth, it is helpful to see how Colgate-Palmolive’s Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

53,2025-02-04,Palantir stock reached a new high after the company reported a robust earnings report.
54,2025-02-04,"Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq futures are falling in premarket trading Tuesday as the stock market digests China's retaliations for President Donald Trump's tariffs."
55,2025-02-04,"In the thick of the 2010s, Uber was waging ""all-out war"" in China.
Travis Kalanick, Uber's cofounder who resigned in 2017, said that the sheer speed at which Uber's Chinese competitors copied the company's innovations was maddening.
And the way he sees it, that relentless approach eventually gave way to true innovation — the kind of ingenuity recently displayed by Chinese AI startup DeepSeek that sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley.
""There's no way I could express the frenetic intensity of copying that they would do on everything that we would roll out in China,"" Kalanick said on a recent episode of the ""All-In Podcast."" ""And it was so epically intense that I basically had a massive amount of respect for their ability to copy what we did.""
In 2016, the company was in a fierce battle for market share with Chinese rideshare rival Didi Chuxing, to which Uber would later sell its China operations in 2016. But before DiDi absorbed Uber's China business, the pressure to outpace each other created a veritable arms race.
""I just couldn't believe it. We would do real hard work, make it, we'd dial it, and it would be epic and it would be awesome,"" Kalanick said. ""We'd roll it out, and then like two weeks later — boom! They've got it. A week later — boom! They've got it. And, of course, I used that to drive our team.""
The competition pushed Kalanick to recruit ""over 400 Chinese nationals,"" which he said created a sort of subculture within Uber's Silicon Valley office.
""We had a whole floor for the China growth team and it was primarily Chinese Nationals,"" Kalanick said. ""We had billboards on the 101 in Silicon Valley in Chinese — Uber billboards to join our team in Chinese — to serve the homeland, right? It was like an all-out war. It was really epic.""
Eventually, Kalanick said, that furious pace of development — and getting used to working at that speed — gave way to innovation.
""What happens is, when you get really, really good at copying, and that time gets tighter, and tighter, and tighter, and tighter, and tighter, you eventually run out of things to copy,"" Kalanick said. ""And then it flips to creativity and innovation.""
In some cases, Kalanick said that Chinese companies are now getting ahead of their American counterparts.
""But as they exercise that muscle, it gets better, and better, and better,"" Kalanick said. ""So, if you want to know about the future of food, like online food delivery, you don't go to New York City — you go to Shanghai.""
In part, Chinese companies are well-positioned to take advantage of circumstances that are unique to their country, Kalanick said.
""You know, they're taking advantage of their economics on labor and things like this,"" Kalanick said. ""It wouldn't exactly work that way here, but a lot of the innovation you will see coming out on Uber Eats or DoorDash — like the stuff that's coming out now — is stuff that existed three years ago, four years ago in China. Maybe longer.""
CloudKitchens and DiDi Chuxing did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
At some point along the way, Chinese businesses went from lagging behind to setting the bar on innovative features, Kalanick said.
""Eventually you cross that threshold of copying, and you're innovating, and then you're leading,"" Kalanick said. ""And I think we see that in a whole bunch of different places.""

56,2025-02-04,"Recent stock market favorite Palantir notched another milestone Tuesday, surging after its latest earnings report to join an elite group of U.S. firms worth more than $200 billion as the software giant benefits handsomely from its “position at the center of the AI revolution,” as its billionaire CEO Alexander Karp describes it.
Palantir CEO Alex Karp
Shares of Palantir jumped as much as 28% shortly after 10 a.m. EST, registering a record share price of $106.91, as investors reacted overwhelmingly positively to the firm’s fourth-quarter earnings report released Monday afternoon, before the stock settled into a 24% gain by market close, trading at about $104.
That sent Palantir’s market capitalization to as high as $240 billion, making it more valuable than household names like the $221 billion American Express, $208 billion McDonald’s and the $207 billion Disney.
Palantir is now the 47th “mega-cap” publicly traded American company valued at $200 billion or more.
The rally came after Palantir greatly exceeded expectations in its quarterly results and financial outlook, as Q4’s record $0.14 adjusted earnings per share and $828 million in revenue beat consensus analyst estimates by 26% and 7%, respectively, according to FactSet.
Palantir’s 2025 guidance for $3.74 billion to $3.76 billion in sales and $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion in adjusted free cash flow called for about 30% respective top and bottom line growth.
Palantir’s rise has been meteoric, as its stock is up more than 10 times its value two years ago, when its market cap sat below $20 billion. Government contracts accounted for 55% of the company’s revenue in 2024. Palantir provides AI-enabled data analytics insights to its customers, which include Amazon and the Department of Defense. Palantir was the S&P 500’s best-performing stock of 2024 and is off to a hot start to 2025, gaining 40% thus far.
Karp’s net worth swelled by $1.2 billion Tuesday from $7.8 billion to $9 billion, vaulting him from the 374th-richest person in the world to the 305th-richest. Palantir cofounder Peter Thiel’s fortune jumped by $2.4 billion from $15.9 billion to $18.3 billion, making him the 111th-wealthiest person on the planet.
“We're doing it. We're doing it. And I'm sure you're enjoying this as much as I am,” Karp said when asked at the conclusion of Monday’s earnings call about his message to retail investors in his company.
Palantir is by far the most expensive stock on the S&P via the commonly cited valuation metric of price-to-sales, which compares a company’s market value to its last 12-month revenues. Palantir’s 70 price-to-sales is more than 20 times the S&P average of 3, even dwarfing the 35 price-to-sales ratio of fellow AI wunderkind Nvidia. “History suggests [this] is nearly impossible to grow into, especially at this scale,” Deutsche Bank analyst Brad Zelnick wrote in a Monday note to clients. Zelnick, who said Palantir’s most recent earnings were “very impressive,” has a sell rating on the stock.
Swedish audio streamer Spotify also enjoyed a big post-earnings bounce on Wall Street, as New York-listed shares of Spotify gained more than 10% to a new intraday record of $618.55.

59,2025-02-04,"Eric Beiley, Executive Managing Director of The Beiley Group at Steward Partners, breaks down for Quartz what China’s retaliatory tariffs could mean for investors, for the latest installment of our “Smart Investing” video series.
Watch the interview above and check out the transcript below. The transcript of this conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.
ANDY MILLS (AM): Given that China has imposed these retaliatory tariffs and launched an antitrust investigation into Google, how do you see this impacting global markets and strategies for US investors?
ERIC BEILEY (EB): Overall, I think we’ve dodged a bullet. Yesterday investors woke up pretty concerned. We were down pretty significantly with the Trump tariff announcements on first Mexico and Canada, then China. But as the day went on, we saw these agreements with Mexico and Canada, and you saw the reaction by investors, right? The markets recovered across the board. And so that’s positive. And then into today, tariffs are still a major theme and I think will be with the Trump administration, but we haven’t seen yet from investors a willingness to really exit. I think investors are still overall confident and on board with the equity market.
AM: So the tariffs are not a big deal?
EB: No, it is a big deal because tariffs have significant impacts. And across the board for investors, I would say they’re negative. Tariffs are attacks and so it has negative implications on pricing, on inflation, consumer demand, obviously on all the companies and how they react to their manufacturing practices. So tariffs are negative. We’re seeing it’s also a negotiation tool and if used effectively so far, you know, investors are nervous, but still on board. And so that’s, that’s my hope going forward.
AM: What are some other areas of volatility or uncertainty you see in the markets?
EB: I think number one is interest rates. We saw that in the early part of January. It looked like from a couple economic figures that inflation was on the rise. And if we, if you looked at the yield markets, the 30-year tipped at 5% and 5% is a level that is a big no-no for equities, right? And you saw this huge decline, right? 800 point decline in the markets, but then very quickly we recovered as more economic data came in. That inflation was not as prevalent. And today we’ve seen a big reversal. Rates have come down and equities have gone higher. The risk trade is there, but we’ll have to see. Rates and inflation are a big issue. And the Fed met in January and they decided to keep rates level, which was the consensus view, and we’ll have to see going forward. Trump wants lower rates. And so it’ll be interesting to see how the Fed-Trump relationship evolves.
AM: You’re cautiously optimistic and have said that you’re a fan of what you call ‘dividend aristocrats’ Walmart (WMT), Sherwin Williams (SHW), and Brown and Brown (BRO), who have consistently raised their dividend for 25 years. What about these companies do you find appealing in the current market environment?
EB: Well, we’ve seen a shift, right? Growth equity has really outperformed for the last several years, substantially over value stocks, dividend paying companies by almost two-to-one. But in the last two to three months, we’ve seen a shift. And this year, if you look at the value indexes, they’re outperforming quite a lot over growth. And so companies in my view that can reward shareholders with dividend payments and increase those dividend payments or dividend growth are very attractive long-term investments. And so these three companies have all shown in all types of economic cycles, they can raise their dividends and they’ve outperformed the S&P 500 on a five- and 10-year basis. That’s not easy to do. We all know Walmart, great American consumer store, Sherwin Williams, more in the housing market, and then Brown and Brown’s an insurance company, a very well-run financial firm.
AM: Many of our guests are fans of Walmart. What sets them apart from competitors?
EB: Clearly their size, their scale, their product base, their pricing, very loyal clients, consumers really like Walmart and they’re just very well run. I track the analysts who cover Walmart. I don’t know the ins and outs of everything, of their balance sheet and earnings and profits, but it’s just a fantastic American story and it’s a fantastic investment long-term.
AM: And you mentioned Sherwin Williams being more of a housing player. Are you optimistic about the housing market moving forward?
EB: Optimistic? We’ve seen housing now, for a while, there’s been very little supply and prices keep going higher, right? So it’s very difficult for first time home buyers and or people who wanna sell homes, right? Because of mortgages, a lot of people have very low mortgage rates, and so rates are higher. So no one wants to sell a house and then look to buy and have a new mortgage at a higher rate, and maybe even a higher mortgage. No one’s gonna do that. So housing’s a challenge. And that’s what the Fed and interest rates, so lower rates would be beneficial for housing, but for Sher, when Williams specifically, people are still investing in their homes still, right? We’re seeing that, whether it’s upgrades, renovations of any kind, they benefit from that.
AM: And aside from the dividend, what edge does Brown and Brown have over their competitors?
EB: They’re a kind of a behind-the-scenes insurance company, reinsurance, big commercial lines of insurance, and they run their books very well. And they’re a company in the financial space and I do like financials. That has proven over time to be a great long-term investment and they’ve rewarded shareholders with steady dividend growth.

This first appeared in the Planet Money newsletter. You can sign up here.
Last week, news spread that a Chinese AI company, DeepSeek, had built a cutting-edge chatbot at a fraction of the cost of its American competitors. It sent the stock prices of American tech companies plummeting.
But Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella put a happy spin on the whole episode, citing a 160-year-old economics concept to suggest that this was good news.
""Jevons paradox strikes again!"" Nadella wrote on social media, sharing the concept's Wikipedia page. ""As AI gets more efficient and accessible, we will see its use skyrocket, turning it into a commodity we just can't get enough of.""
In other words, don't worry, investors! This obscure economics concept shows a profitable path forward even though our competitors are drastically undercutting us. Look, here's Wikipedia and a story about 19th-century coal.
Jevons paradox may remain somewhat obscure, but over the last few decades, it has been cited as a reason why more energy-efficient cars, appliances and light bulbs may fail to reduce our consumption of fossil fuels. It has been cited as a reason why building more highway lanes fails to solve traffic congestion. And it's being cited by people in the AI realm — beyond just Nadella — as a potential reason why AI may actually create more jobs in some occupations rather than mass layoffs.
Today in the Planet Money newsletter, what is Jevons paradox? Where does it come from? How much of it is BS? And why does this 160-year-old concept all of a sudden seem relevant for our futuristic age of AI?
In the early 1860s, English leaders began to worry about coal. The combustible black rock found deep in the ground had literally powered the Industrial Revolution. England's economy was completely dependent on it. And now leaders were worried it was going to run out.
Enter economist William Stanley Jevons. Born in Liverpool — like The Beatles! — Jevons was likewise on his way to international stardom. Before Beatlemania, there was Jevonsmania.
OK, fine, so Jevons was never really that popular. Only nerds have ever known or cared about him.
Nonetheless, back in the mid-19th century, Jevons was pioneering the use of math and statistics in economics, charting the way for what would become known as neoclassical economics, which would dominate the field for centuries to come.
When English leaders began fretting about coal, the late-20-something Jevons decided he wanted to address their concerns. And so, in 1865, he published a book named The Coal Question: An Inquiry Concerning the Progress of the Nation, and the Probable Exhaustion of Our Coal-Mines.
At the time, the English might have taken comfort in the idea that their coal-shortage problem could be solved, or at least punted down the road, by technological innovations that increased the efficiency of coal consumption. Surely, all it would take was building engines and furnaces that produced more power with less coal. More-efficient technologies would reduce coal consumption, and then maybe the coal-less doomsday could be averted for a long time.
Jevons argued that, basically, this solution was dumb. He spent an entire chapter in The Coal Question arguing that more-energy-efficient technology could not solve England's coal-shortage problem. In fact, Jevons wrote, greater efficiency of coal-powered technologies would — paradoxically — lead to more consumption of coal, not less.
""It is wholly a confusion of ideas to suppose that the economical use of fuel is equivalent to a diminished consumption,"" Jevons wrote. ""The very contrary is the truth.""

Jevons' thinking was this: With greater efficiency, you get more for less, more power out of every lump of coal. And that effectively lowers the cost of coal energy. You can now burn your furnace or run your factory's machines longer for cheaper. And, lower prices mean higher demand.
And we're not talking just like a bit more demand. Jevons was living during a time in which coal was fueling rapid industrialization. When he looked around him, he saw factories being built, infrastructure getting erected and new coal-powered inventions radically changing his society. When he saw engines and furnaces getting more efficient and thus cheaper to run, he saw that as sparking an atomic explosion of demand.
As coal-powered steam engines became cheaper to run, for example, companies and governments found all sorts of new applications for the technology. Jevons uses all sorts of old-timey examples. The ""cheapness of the power,"" he wrote, ""allows us to draw rivers from our mines"" and ""drive our coal-pits."" More-efficient steam engines were deployed in new factories, trains and steamships.
Likewise, more-efficient blast furnaces, which used heat from coal to smelt iron, helped the iron industry become more profitable and grow bigger. Building even more-efficient furnaces, he wrote, would only help grow the industry more — and with it the number of furnaces it used. That would ""more than make up for the diminished consumption of each.""
In the macro view, Jevons suggested, more-efficient use of coal would stimulate economic growth, increasing coal consumption across the economy. ""It is the very economy of the use of coal that makes our industry what it is,"" Jevons wrote, ""and the more we render it efficient and economical, the more will our industry thrive, and our works of civilization grow.""
If anything, Jevons claimed, making coal-powered technologies more energy efficient would only speed up the inevitable collapse of coal resources. Greater efficiency increased consumption, not decreased it. This was the original iteration of what became known as the Jevons paradox.
Despite The Coal Question becoming a bestseller in the 19th century and despite Jevons' historic contributions to economics, the Jevons paradox was mostly forgotten about in the 20th century. That is until the 1970s, when the modern environmental movement and an oil crisis led economists to start thinking hard about energy efficiency again. Governments began pursuing policies like mandating greater fuel efficiency for cars, and people began to wonder, ""How much will that really reduce our consumption of fossil fuels?""
It was within this context that economists rediscovered the Jevons paradox. And they created a modern formulation that's a bit more nuanced. The idea is that making things like cars and appliances more energy efficient creates a ""rebound effect."" When you make a machine more energy efficient, it effectively lowers the cost of using it. And — hello, the classic law of demand from economics — when stuff gets cheaper, people tend to use or consume more of it.
So, for example, with more-fuel-efficient cars, it gets cheaper to travel every mile, so people drive more miles. Some may decide to stop riding the bus and buy a car. Some families may buy a second car. Others may buy bigger vehicles, like SUVs. With more-efficient light bulbs, people may keep their lights on for longer or build things like the Sphere in Las Vegas.

The rebound effect from greater energy efficiency reduces the environmental benefits of energy-efficient technologies.
Now, there's nothing paradoxical about stuff getting cheaper and demand going up. That's classic economics. And if the rebound effect is small, then gains in energy efficiency will still lead to a reduction in overall energy consumption. There is no real Jevons paradox unless energy demand dramatically explodes in response to the lower energy costs of more-efficient machines.
There has been a lot of debate over how big rebound effects actually are in various energy markets. As far as we can tell, it seems like most economists who analyze this closely find that, generally speaking, rebound effects in modern energy markets tend to be rather small. They're like, sure, the rebound effect is real and it dilutes the environmental benefits of greater energy efficiency, but it doesn't come close to completely canceling them out. So, for example, if I buy a Prius, maybe I'll go on more road trips or whatever, but that doesn't negate all the fuel savings over the vehicle's lifetime. Studies suggest that energy-efficient vehicles and appliances still, on net, result in lower energy consumption.
But others stress that the ripple effects of more-energy-efficient technologies are harder to measure. They argue that, when you look at the bigger picture of how demand explodes in response to cheaper energy, estimates of rebound effects have been too small. In some cases, they argue, the rebound effect can be so big that increasing something's efficiency can backfire, resulting in greater overall energy consumption — the very paradox that Jevons wrote about.
In a 2010 article in The New Yorker, ""The Efficiency Dilemma,"" journalist David Owen made a big deal out of the Jevons paradox in the modern world. He pointed to what happened after refrigerators became more energy efficient during his lifetime. Some Americans began buying multiple refrigerators for their homes. Hotels began putting mini-fridges in every room. ""Gas stations now often have almost as much refrigerated shelf space as the grocery stores of my early childhood,"" he wrote. More-efficient refrigeration also encouraged people to buy more food, because they could keep it longer, and that often leads to food waste, another energy cost. This refrigeration technology was also adopted in air conditioners, and those have similarly proliferated in cars, homes and buildings around the world. All of this, Owen suggests, has resulted in a massive rebound effect where maybe more-energy-efficient refrigeration technology has actually resulted in overall higher energy consumption.
However, U.K. journalist Tim Harford (a frequent guest of Planet Money) writes that Owen blows this all out of proportion. Sure, there are real rebound effects. But, he writes, ""In my lifetime, energy consumption per person in the UK has fallen by one-third, while carbon dioxide emissions per person have fallen by nearly 60 per cent.""
In short, the extreme version of Jevons paradox in today's energy markets may be BS. Very likely, greater efficiency does not lead to greater consumption of fossil fuels. But maybe that's because today's economy is unlike the economy of Jevon's lifetime, when England was experiencing rapid, coal-powered industrialization. These days, gains in efficiency and resulting reductions in energy costs don't result in the same explosion of energy demand.
All of a sudden, it seems like a lot of people are talking about the potential for a Jevons paradox in the market for artificial intelligence.
This wouldn't be the first time the concept had jumped from its traditional home in energy economics. Over the years, scholars and writers have seen versions of it in other places. For example, scholars have found evidence of a Jevons paradox in water markets, where, for example, greater efficiency in irrigation leads to greater overall water consumption. Others have found evidence of a Jevons paradox for infrastructure, where, for example, more highway lanes end up creating more traffic congestion.
And now people like Microsoft's Nadella are embracing the concept, suggesting he believes — or he wants us to believe — that as AI gets more efficient and cheaper, demand for it will explode and, despite bruising competition from companies like DeepSeek, there will be many profits to be made, including by Microsoft and its business partner OpenAI. That is far from guaranteed. We still don't know what AI will be capable of, how consumers will ultimately want to use it, and what competition, costs and a host of other factors will look like in the AI market.
But the Jevons paradox may also be relevant in the AI realm for another reason: It could help us understand what could happen to some occupations if AI revolutionized them and made workers more productive.
Last month, Planet Money attended the annual meeting of American economists, and we saw Stanford University economist Erik Brynjolfsson talk about the Jevons paradox and what it could mean for certain occupations.
As previously explained, Jevons saw that as coal-powered tech got more efficient, it led to an increase in demand for coal, not a decrease. Brynjolfsson sees the potential for something similar with certain occupations and AI. That is, as AI makes certain occupations more efficient, it could lead to an increase in demand for human labor, not mass layoffs.
Brynjolfsson points to what happened to airplane pilots after jets were invented as an example of what could possibly happen in some occupations. ""Pilots became dramatically more productive and effective once jets were invented,"" Brynjolfsson says. They could travel farther and faster, effectively lowering the cost of every mile of air travel. ""Did that mean that we didn't need as many pilots because now pilots could do more work? No. We consumers decided that we're going to fly more than ever. So now a lot more people fly. And there's more demand for pilots.""
Now, for more clarity, a Jevons paradox for AI-affected occupations will only really happen if at least three crucial boxes are checked:
First, workers get more productive thanks to AI. That's not guaranteed. On the one hand, AI could turn out to be really amazing and not need humans to do certain occupations at all. On the other hand, AI could prove to be largely a dud for productivity — kinda like the smartphone has so far proved to be — and not really boost how much workers can produce per hour.
Second, higher worker productivity translates into lower prices. This doesn't mean that workers have to get paid less. It means that as they make more widgets or fly more miles or generate more ideas per hour, the prices of what they're selling to consumers effectively drops.
Third, and this is really crucial, consumer demand needs to explode in reaction to lower prices. (To use econ jargon, this hinges on whether demand is ""elastic"" or ""inelastic."")
Brynjolfsson believes there will be certain occupations that check each box. In fact, he suggests, there may already be some occupations seeing a Jevons paradox-like process unfold. For example, coders, translators and radiologists are all occupations that may be seeing AI increasing their productivity and that seem to be growing despite (or because of) that.
That's the happy scenario, where a Jevons paradox makes workers more efficient and increases demand for their labor, rather than decreasing it. There's lots of job growth, and wages may even go up.
Of course, technological change won't do this for all occupations. For one, if your employer doesn't share the fruits of higher productivity with you or if the machine makes your job easier to do and more people can do it, you might not see higher wages. You could see falling wages over time. And, of course, if a machine can completely automate every task of your job, you're out of luck. And even if it doesn't, and if humans are still needed to do the job, massive gains in productivity can still shrink the number of workers needed in some occupations.
Take, for example, farmer jobs. Around 1900, 40% of American workers worked in agriculture. Today, it's less than 2%.
Why did the percentage of Americans farming for a living radically shrink? For one, new technologies, like tractors and robotic fruit and vegetable pickers, dramatically increased farmer productivity in making food. But — and this is crucial — Brynjolfsson says demand for food didn't explode as much as was needed to keep mass numbers of farmers employed (in other words, demand for food proved to be ""inelastic"").
"" A few farmers can produce way more food than they did before, and however much as we try, we just aren't eating that much more,"" Brynjolfsson says. In other words, the price of food has fallen as farmers have gotten more efficient, but the rebound effect — the increase in demand in response to falling food prices — has not exploded enough to offset the job-killing effects of each farmer being able to produce a lot more food. There's a relatively fixed amount of food we eat, and with farmers able to produce much more in the modern era, we don't need as many farmers to satisfy food demand.
But Brynjolfsson is a self-declared ""techno-optimist."" While he recognizes that automation has created losers throughout history, including in big sectors like farming and manufacturing, he sees technological change as being a net win for jobs in the long sweep of history.
"" We've had a lot of amazing technologies — bulldozers and computers and spreadsheets and all sorts of other things — that made people radically more efficient in what they're doing,"" Brynjolfsson says. And yet, perhaps paradoxically, ""We just keep hiring more and more people.""
That said, we don't really know what AI is going to be capable of, and, Brynjolfsson says, he doesn't rule out the possibility that the future could be different.
Interestingly, Jevons himself — in that very same chapter in The Coal Question where he outlines his paradox — talks specifically about his paradox in action in the labor market.
After ""the introduction of new machinery"" increases worker productivity, Jevons wrote, it often ""throws labourers out of employment for the moment. But such is the increased demand for the cheapened products, that eventually the sphere of employment is greatly widened. Often the very labourers whose labour is saved find their more efficient labour more demanded than before.""
Of course, predicting the future of technological change is very hard. In fact, William Stanley Jevons is a cautionary tale for this. In retrospect, Jevons was embarrassingly wrong in The Coal Question. He predicted that England would indeed run out of coal, which would create a serious problem for its economy. He advised that, basically, England should stop deficit spending and brace for the inevitable collapse of its economy. What he failed to predict: The nation would find other sources of energy to power its industry in the years to come.

62,2025-02-04,"Swimsuit season isn't actually a time of year, but a state of mind ... just ask birthday girl and Internet personality Hannah Stocking.
The comedienne turned 33 on Tuesday, but she has routinely proven that she is only getting hotter with age. Just take a peek at her most sizzlin' hot shots, many of which feature skin-showing 2-pieces that are nothing to laugh at.
Hannah appeared to channel Dominatrix Barbie in one pleather-looking bikini ... which barely covered up her curves thanks to some strategically placed buckles and cutouts. We're guessing vanilla isn't her favorite flavor!!!
Hannah went a bit more angelic for her next swimsuit shot, as she rocked a crisp white one-piece for a different poolside hang. Though, if you take a closer look, you'll see the bathing suit cut all the way up to her ribcage, making it one of her hottest looks yet.
The former Vine star then left little to the imagination courtesy of a black string bikini ... which we're certain gave her all sorts of odd tan lines.
Obviously, Hannah knows how to keep things hot -- even in the dead of winter.
Happy birthday, girl!!!

AMD (AMD) reported its fourth quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday, beating expectations on the top and bottom lines and providing a better-than-anticipated Q1 forecast.
The chipmaker's announcement comes the same day President Donald Trump enacted a 10% tariff on goods made in China and a little over a week after China-based DeepSeek rocked the tech world with its low-cost AI models.
Despite the earnings beat and stronger guidance, AMD stock fell over 3.5% in after-hours trading.
AMD is battling to take market share in the AI space from rival Nvidia (NVDA), which dominates sales of high-powered AI chips. At the same time, the company is contending with a continued slowdown in PC sales, even as the industry works to push consumers and enterprises toward AI PCs — computers that feature specialized processors designed to power AI tasks.
For the quarter, AMD reported earnings per share (EPS) of $1.09 on revenue of $7.56 billion. Wall Street was expecting EPS of $1.09 and revenue of $7.5 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. The company’s data center business, its largest segment by revenue, brought in $3.9 billion, just shy of expectations of $4.09 billion for the quarter.
AMD’s client segment, which includes chips for PCs, generated $2.3 billion for the quarter. Analysts were anticipating revenue of $1.98 billion. The company also saw Gaming revenue of $563 million. Wall Street was looking for $487 million.
For the current quarter, AMD anticipates revenue between $6.8 billion and $7.4 billion. Wall Street had expected $7.0 billion.
AMD shares have struggled throughout the last 12 months, falling 33% compared to rival Nvidia, which has jumped 80%. Still, that’s better than archnemesis Intel (INTC), which has seen shares fall 54% in the same time period.
While Trump’s tariffs on Chinese-made goods won’t impact the majority of the high-end chip market, since many are manufactured in areas like Taiwan, the broader market for electronics, including servers and PCs, which are built in China, will be impacted.
Read more: What are tariffs, and how do they affect you?
If businesses and consumers are turned off by higher prices on those systems and devices, chip manufacturers like AMD could face slowing sales.
Beyond the tariffs on Chinese goods, Trump has also raised the specter of tariffs specifically targeting semiconductors and products associated with them in a bid to bring manufacturing to the US. But those kinds of tariffs drive up prices for consumers for a long stretch of time, as building chip facilities is a complex task that takes years to complete.

66,2025-02-04,"Layne Schranz’ Pikes Peak-winning turbocharged stock car might be the most impressive vehicle I have ever witnessed. With a 410 cubic-inch American V8 up front it already sounds like demons and hellfire, but slap on a pair of 6182 turbochargers and you’ll have a duet of banshees playing winds right alongside. With over 1,000 rear-wheel horsepower and a total weight of just 2,650 pounds, this ridiculous machine leaves pretty much everything else in its dust. In the parlance of my grandfather and his hot-roddin’ pals, this monster machine really shits ‘n gits. All that and it’s pretty damn cheap, to boot. This is your opportunity to buy a car that ran a sub-10-minute at Pikes Peak for just $54,000. 
Don’t get me wrong, $54,000 is a lot of dosh. You could buy a really nice daily driver for that kind of money, or have a down payment on an above-average home in most U.S. states. But if you’re looking for a better horsepower-per-dollar outcome, and you’re tired of giving dorky Corvettes a point-by at your local trackday, this is the car for you, buddy. 
Here’s what the seller had to say about the car: 
2016 Chevrolet SS custom chassis fiberglass body sub 10 min Pikes Peak Hill Climb car. Perfect for Time Attack, Time Trial, Drifting, Track Days or Road Racing. 2650lb total weight. 2 410 cubic inch all aluminum ENGINES: All the best components bottom and top end. Custom stainless headers, two 6182 Turbos, Holley Dominator Fuel Injection tuned on methanol which can be retuned for gasoline. Frankenstien SB2 heads and intake manifolds. Billet, ceramic coated billet pistons. Made 1000 HP at the rear wheels on the chassis dyno at only 4 lbs of boost. Both engines are low miles. They were used for the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb. Call for receipts and details. Engines assembled by USA Performance Engines in Denver Colorado.
﻿6 speed Saenz Sequential Trans, Independent Rear Suspension with Frankland Quick Change with Gleason Locker. Spare Speedway Quick Change. Inboard Rear Brakes. Multiple sets of wheels and tires. Spare suspension components. Spare drive shaft, axles and CV joints. Anti Gravity light weight battery. Safecraft Fire Suppression System. 6 piston one piece AP Racing front brake calipers with spares. Spare rotors. Spare Speedway Quick Change rear diff.
The car is located in Leeds, Alabama, conveniently right down the street from the Barber Motorsports Park. Maybe if you’re a serious buyer you could organize a track day rental with the owner and see if it’s something you really want to drive (or can even handle with your driving skill set). If I had a little bit more space, money, and talent I’d probably be on the phone to talk about setting up a day I could pick up my new car. If you’re like me but not lacking those three things, maybe you should pick up the phone and call. "
67,2025-02-04,"BEIJING — China countered President Donald Trump’s tariffs on Chinese products with tariffs of its own on multiple U.S. imports Tuesday as well as announcing an antitrust investigation into Google and other trade measures.
U.S. tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico also were to go into effect Tuesday, though Trump agreed to a 30-day pause on his threats against Mexico and Canada as they acted to appease his concerns about border security and drug trafficking. Trump planned to talk with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the next few days.
This isn’t the first round of tit-for-tat actions between the two countries. China and the U.S. had engaged in a trade war in 2018 when Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods and China responded in kind.
This time, analysts said, China is much better prepared to counter.
“They have a much more developed export control regime. We depend on them for a lot of critical minerals: gallium, germanium, graphite, a host of others. So … they could put some significant harm on our economy,” said Philip Luck, a former State Department official and director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies on Monday at a forum.
The slew of measures announced Tuesday cut across different sectors of the economy, from energy to individual U.S. companies.
China said it would implement a 15% tariff on coal and liquefied natural gas products as well as a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery and large-engine cars imported from the U.S. The tariffs would take effect next Monday.
“The U.S.’s unilateral tariff increase seriously violates the rules of the World Trade Organization,” the State Council Tariff Commission said in a statement. “It is not only unhelpful in solving its own problems, but also damages normal economic and trade cooperation between China and the U.S.”
China is the world’s largest importer of liquefied natural gas, with its top suppliers being Australia, Qatar and Malaysia. The U.S., which is the biggest exporter of LNG globally, does not significantly export LNG to China.
In 2023, the U.S. exported 173,247 million cubic feet of LNG to China, representing about 2.3% of total natural gas export volumes, according to data released by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
In addition to the tariffs, China announced export controls on several elements critical to the production of modern high-tech products. They include tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, molybdenum and indium, many of which are designated as critical minerals by the U.S. Geological Survey, meaning they are essential to U.S. economic or national security that have supply chains vulnerable to disruption.
The export controls are in addition to ones China placed in December on key elements such as gallium used in manufacturing.
In addition, China’s State Administration for Market Regulation said Tuesday it is investigating Google on suspicion of violating antitrust laws. The announcement did not mention the tariffs but came just minutes after Trump’s 10% tariffs on China were to take effect.
It is unclear how the probe will affect Google’s operations. Google has a limited presence in China, and its search engine is blocked in the country like most other Western platforms. Google exited the Chinese market in 2010 after refusing to comply with censorship requests from the Chinese government and following a series of cyberattacks on the company.
Google did not immediately comment.
The Commerce Ministry also placed two American companies on an unreliable entities list: PVH Group, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and Illumina, which is a biotechnology company with offices in China. The listing bars them from engaging in China-related import or export activities and from making new investments in the country.
Beijing began investigating PVH Group in September last year over “improper Xinjiang-related behavior” after the company allegedly boycotted the use of Xinjiang cotton.
The response from China appears calculated and measured, said Stephen Dover, chief market strategist and head of the Franklin Templeton Institute. However, the world is braced for further impact.
“A risk is that this is the beginning of a tit-for-tat trade war, which could result in lower GDP growth everywhere, higher U.S. inflation, a stronger dollar and upside pressure on U.S. interest rates,” Dover said.

68,2025-02-04,China's new action against Google may be another volley in an ongoing trade war
69,2025-02-04,"We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists.
US stocks moved higher on Tuesday as investors assessed China's instant retaliation to US President Donald Trump's additional tariffs amid worries about the risk of a trade war.
Traders also took in fresh jobs data, with job openings declining more than expected in December. Investors are continuing to watch any signs of cooling in the labor market as the Federal Reserve debates future interest rate cuts in the face of sticky inflation. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) traded above the flatline, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose about 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped over 0.1% on the heels of a losing day for stocks.
Beijing reacted swiftly on Tuesday to Trump's additional 10% levies on Chinese imports going into effect at midnight. China slapped tariffs of 15% on US coal and liquified natural gas, starting Feb. 10, alongside 10% duties on imports of crude oil, farm equipment, and some autos.
The tit-for-tat measures raise the risk of an escalation into trade war that would damage both of the world's top two economies. But some on Wall Street see the Chinese response as showing restraint that opens the door to compromise, as seen in the US tariff postponement deals with Mexico and Canada.
Giving more cause for optimism, Trump brought forward talks with China's President Xi Jinping. He said on Monday they would take place ""probably over the next 24 hours,"" rather than later in the week.
The US dollar index (DX-Y.NYB) fell slightly, down about 0.8% as worries eased somewhat.
Meanwhile, China opened an antitrust investigation into Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Google and added Calvin Klein owner PVH (PVH) and biotech company Illumina (ILMN) to its ""unreliable entities list.""
Alphabet shares were up about 2% in early trading, as investors wait for the tech megacap's fourth quarter results due after the bell. The focus is on insights into the tech giant's efforts to turn its massive AI investments into new revenue streams and its response to Chinese startup DeepSeek's cheaper AI models.
Job openings declined more than expected in December as investors continue to watch closely for any signs of cooling in the labor market.
New data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Tuesday showed there were 7.6 million jobs open at the end of December, a decrease from from the 8.15 million seen in November.
The November figure was revised higher from the 8.01 million open jobs initially reported. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected Tuesday's report to show eight million openings in November.
The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) also showed 5.46 million hires were made during the month, down from the 5.37 million made during November. The hiring rate was flat at 3.4% for the third-straight month. Also in Tuesday's report, the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, was 2% in December, unchanged from the month prior.
US stocks opened mixed on Tuesday as investors continued to assess back-and-forth tariff developments, with China responding to President Trump's 10% tariffs with its own duties on US goods.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged down roughly 0.1%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) opened just around the flatline. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose about 0.2% on the heels of a losing day for stocks.
Google is facing a new antitrust probe in China, as Beijing responds to Trump's ""first salvo"" of tariffs with a warning shot showing where it thinks it can hit the US hard.
But shares in Google owner Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) inched higher in pre-market, rising almost 1%, even as Big Tech eyes a potential hit from Trump's tariffs itself.
Investors may well be holding fire for the megacap tech's fourth quarter results, due after the bell, to get a steer on whether its massive AI spending is about to pay off. China has already brought one challenge to Alphabet, in the shape of Chinese start-up DeepSeek's cheaper AI models.
At the same time, some on Wall Street see the Google parent as more insulated than its peers from tariff risk, given its cloud and ad strength stand to offset AI stumbles. Though there is a chance that the market is underpricing tariff risk — or is just baffled as to what Trump will do next, as Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reports.
Shares of Spotify (SPOT) climbed over 9% before the bell on the heels of upbeat quarterly results. The stock has already surged roughly 150% over the past year, as of Monday's close.
Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal reports:
Spotify Technology posted fiscal fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday that beat revenue expectations, as it reported its first full-year profit.
The audio giant also posted another strong quarter of subscriber gains, as levels of churn remain low despite recent price increases.
The results follow an intense business overhaul, which has included everything from mass layoffs and C-suite shakeups to a major strategic shift away from podcasts — an area it had aggressively pursued. Those efforts allowed the stock to stage a comeback from the record lows it faced in 2022.
Read more here.
Europe's stock markets trod water on Tuesday, as investors eyed the US-China exchange of tariff fire for clues to what duties Trump might hit the EU with.
The pan-European Stoxx 600 (^STOXX) wavered below the flat line as a series of corporate earnings shifted the mood. Germany's DAX (^GDAXI) retraced deeper morning losses to trade little changed, while the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris was more upbeat, with a 0.3% gain. The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) in London trended lower.
Overall, I'm not liking these earnings from PepsiCo.
The food giant's 2025 sales and EPS guidance were relatively in line with consensus. The Street may have some concern about the company hitting those targets, judging by how the fourth quarter played out. Pressure was on the top and bottom lines in the company's two most important segments: Frito Lay and North America beverages.
PepsiCo continues to see heightened competition in its categories and low-income consumers spending cautiously, given years of price increases.
Its shares are off by 2.5% in the pre-market.
I am talking to PepsiCo (PEP) chair and CEO Ramon Laguarta ahead of his earnings call today at around 7:45 a.m. ET, so I will jump back in here with more insights.
Economic data: Job openings (December); factory orders (December); durable and capital goods orders (December final)
Earnings: Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), AMD (AMD), Amgen (AMGN), Apollo (APO), Chipotle (CMG), Electronic Arts (EA), Enphase (ENPH), Estée Lauder (EL), Ferrari (RACE), Juniper Networks (JNPR), Merck (MRK), PayPal (PYPL), PepsiCo (PEP), Pfizer (PFE), Snap (SNAP), Spotify (SPOT)
Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning:
China hits back with tariffs on US goods after Trump imposes new levies
'There is no forecast': Wall Street still doesn't know what to make of Trump's tariff plans
Palantir stock soars after outlook beat citing 'untamed' AI demand
Trump's 10% tariffs on China could hit Big Tech hard
Google hit with antitrust probe by China
Fed's Goolsbee: Trump policies could slow rate cuts
Want to be amused by an earnings call? Listen to Palantir (PLTR) CEO Alex Karp on his quarterly calls.
The guy is a real hoot (and just an interesting character in tech more broadly).
I think Karp gave the type of earnings call we will begin to hear from this new crop of tech players during the Trump administration. Antagonistic. Hype filled. Boastful. But he also has the numbers to back up the smoke-blowing, in part because of 1) a strong enterprise-tech spending cycle; 2) optimism on critical infrastructure spending by Trump.
The company beat analysts' sales estimates by an impressive $59 million.
""We believe Palantir is the best story in all of software,"" said DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria in a note this morning.
Shares are up 18% pre-market. The ticker page is the most active on the Yahoo Finance platform.
China announced on Tuesday that it has launched an anti-monopoly investigation into Alphabet's Google (GOOG) and placed two U.S. companies on its ""unreliable entity list."" This move concurred with the U.S. implementing new tariffs on Chinese goods.
Alongside the regulatory body exploring American firms, China imposed of tariffs on some U.S. products, including coal and oil, in retaliation to the fresh U.S. duties. This marks the first retaliation in the ongoing trade tensions between the world's two largest economies.
In addition to Google, China's Commerce Ministry added PVH Corp (parent company of brands like Calvin Klein) and U.S. biotech firm Illumina to its ""unreliable entity"" list of companies that have taken actions that cause ""damage"" to Chinese companies and interests.
Gold (GC=F) rose toward a record high as President Donald Trump’s tariff threats and delays boost demand for a stable asset.
Spot gold rose to $2,850 an ounce before dropping back from an all-time high as Trump said he would enact a 30-day pause on tariffs of 25% against Canada and Mexico. The switch in plans saw the dollar retreat from the highest level in more than two years, making the precious metal cheaper for US buyers.
Markets remain unsettled about the future, boosting gold’s appeal as a safe haven. From Tuesday, Washington is set to impose a 10% tariff on Chinese imports, though Trump has indicated he plans to discuss the proposed tariffs with Beijing ""in the next 24 hours""
Key concerns revolve around how the US economy will fare in the face of a potential trade war, as well as the broader implications for monetary policy if tariffs spark inflation. The Federal Reserve opted to pause rate cuts last month, taking a ""wait-and-see"" stance on the new administration’s policies.

Yuanbao are a seasonal collectible for GTA Online’s Lunar New Year celebration.
Once you find a Yuanbao, you’ll receive GTA$ 888 and 888 RP — totaling up to GTA$ 31,968 and 31,968 RP. After you find them all, you’ll also receive the Gold Snake Santo Capra outfit.
However, finding them is easier said than done as there are 36 of these tiny collectibles scattered around the huge map of GTA V. To help, we’ve marked all Yuanbao locations in GTA Online on a map below.
There are a total of 36 Yuanbao found around San Andreas. When you’re near a Yuanbao, you’ll hear the sound of traditional Chinese instruments, which will grow louder as you get closer.
Before starting, you’ll need a helicopter as some of the locations are not accessible without one.
To ease the search, we’ve split the map into two — Los Santos and Northern San Andreas — and marked each Yuanbao location on both maps along with a description of their location.

74,2025-02-04,"Chipotle’s (CMG) fourth-quarter earnings beat expectations, showing that more customers are still flocking to its restaurants despite it hiking prices by 2% last year.
Strong traffic didn’t keep the burrito maker’s stock from taking a hit after it said it expects weak same-store sales growth for 2025, prompting shares to drop by more than 4% in after hours trading. 
“I want to make sure that as we continue to scale Chipotle, everything we do is in service of our guests or those who serve our guests,”  said Scott Boatwright, Chipotle’s CEO, in a statement.
The California-based Chipotle reported revenue for the quarter of $2.85 billion, meeting Wall Street’s revenue expectations. Total revenue for the quarter jumped by 13.1%, according to the company’s earnings release. 
Chipotle’s same-store sales rose 5.4%, but were still slightly below analysts expectations of 5.7%. Still, transactions climbed 4%, continuing the chain’s streak of higher foot traffic. 
This is no small feat, especially as the broader restaurant industry continues to grapple with sluggish customer traffic, as many consumers cut back on dining out to save money. In Dec. 2024, Chipotle said it would raise prices by 2%, further building on its price hikes, which have increased four times over the last two years. The month prior, it named Scott Boatwright as CEO after Brian Niccol stepped down to take over Starbucks (SBUX). 
 In 2025, the chain is projecting sales growth to be between the low to mid-single digit range. It also plans to open 315 to 345 new locations, many of which will feature “Chipotlanes” – the drive-thru for digital orders that’s become a key part of the brand’s strategy. 
In Sept. 2024, Chipotle introduced two robots to help streamline operations and meet rising demand. The first, called “Autocado,” automates the process of cutting, coring, and peeling avocados. Currently in use at a Huntington Beach, California location, Autocado can process an avocado in just 26 seconds. 
The second robot, “Augmented Makeline,” assists with assembling bowls and salads at a location in Corona del Mar, California. With about 65% of digital orders being bowls or salads, the robot helps manage high-volume orders. While these robots show potential, Chipotle’s previous attempt at automation, a robot called “Chippy” for cutting chips, was discontinued due to cleaning challenges.

Season 2 is live in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, bringing brand-new maps, more game modes, and three new guns to unlock. Here we recommend the best weapon builds to try for your next match of multiplayer.
We also have a guide for recommended Black Ops 6 weapon builds to use in Warzone for Season 2.
Black Ops 6 uses Call of Duty's standard minimap, so this is another year of suppressors being important for staying off the minimap while firing your weapon.
Additionally, Black Ops 6 adds the Wildcard option for more loadout customization. Gunfighter is a Wildcard that lets you add three more attachments to your gun. This can make an already powerful gun feel like a deadly laser beam, so we'll include some overpowered Gunfighter builds as well.

Thanks to weapon tuning in Season 2, the Ames 85 assault rifle has finally dethroned the XM4. This is a fairly easy-to-handle gun, but the recommended attachments will help with recoil control, increase ADS speed, and boost the ammo count.
For a Gunfighter loadout, you can add the Reinforced Barrel, Infiltrator Stock, and the Recoil Springs fire mod.

The Model L assault rifle is now one of the best long-range weapons in the game for multiplayer. The recommended attachments for the weapon will provide extra recoil control, increase ADS speed, provide faster aim-walking speed, and keep you off the minimap when firing.
If you want to run the Gunfighter Wildcard, also add the Reinforced Barrel, Extended Mag I, and the Recoil Springs fire mod.

Season 2's new Cypher 091 isn't quite as easy to use as the Model L or AMES 85, but with the right attachments, it can still be a solid choice for multiplayer. The recommended attachments will help reduce recoil, improve movement, increase hip fire accuracy, and keep you off the minimap when firing.
If you want to run the Gunfighter Wildcard, also throw on the Kepler Microflex optic, Infiltrator Stock, and the Recoil Springs fire mod.

Season 2's new Feng 82 can be a solid choice for a light machine gun, but you'll want to throw on the recommended attachments to increase the mobility, movement speeds, and boost the ammo count.
For a Gunfighter loadout, you can add the Long Barrel, Ranger Foregrip, and the Infiltrator Stock.

One of the best and most mobile guns to make aggressive plays and take advantage of the omnimovement is the PP-919. This build will increase the damage range, speed up your reload, and more. It will also keep you off the minimap when firing.
If you want to run the Gunfighter Wildcard, also throw on the Kepler Microflex optic, Strelok Laser, and Rapid Fire ammo mod.

Season 2 returned the iconic PPSh-41 submachine gun to Call of Duty, and this can be a strong choice for close-range fights. The recommended attachments will
If you want to run the Gunfighter Wildcard, you can add the Kepler Microflex optic, Long Barrel, and Recoil Springs fire mod.

While it might not be the top choice for Warzone, the AMR MOD 4 is a great choice for multiplayer. This is a semi-auto sniper that does feature a fair amount of kick, but the recommended attachments will provide additional recoil control, add more flinch resistance, and increase the fire rate.
For the Gunfighter Wildcard, you can add the Gain-Twist Barrel, Extended Mag I magazine, and the Lightweight Pad stock pad.

Fresh off of his stellar year in 2024, Dennis Lynch is Business Insider's Investor of the Month for January.

        Lynch is a legendary fund manager at Morgan Stanley, consistently outperforming his peers for years by investing in high-flying growth stocks. But when the growth-stock rout of 2022 came, Lynch's funds got hit hard — and harder than most.
    

        His Institutional Advantage Fund (MADSX), the largest he oversees with $4.1 billion in assets, was down as much as 75% from November 2021 to January 2023. According to Morningstar data, the fund was in the bottom 2% of its peer group in both 2021 and 2022.
    

        But over the last couple of years, especially since late 2023, Lynch has started to forge a comeback. MADSX rose 48% in 2023 and 39% in 2024. So far in 2025, it's up another 9%.
    

        Cumulatively, the fund has about 65% of its assets in the consumer discretionary and tech sectors. It's top five holdings as of the end of December include Tesla (TSLA) at 9.48%; Cloudflare (NET) at 9.41%; DoorDash (DASH) at 6.37%; Shopify (SHOP) at 6.3%; and Roblox (RBLX) at 5.43%.
    

        All of those stocks have contributed to MADSX's gain so far this year, but a few have strongly outperformed. Cloudflare was up 23% alone in January, Roblox was up 20.7%, and Snowflake was up 15.2%.
    

        But while near-term surges are nice, Lynch's team is betting these names will deliver big returns over the long term.
    

        ""We find these companies through fundamental research. Our emphasis is on secular growth, and as a result short-term market events are not as meaningful in the stock selection process,"" the fund's 2024 fourth-quarter commentary said.
    

        ""We focus on assessing company prospects over a five year investment horizon,"" the report continued. ""Current portfolio positioning reflects what we believe are the best long-term investment opportunities.""
    

        Those considered for BI's Investor of the Month include managers of US-listed mutual funds or ETFs, those whose funds have outperformed peers in a given month, and those whose funds are outperforming a benchmark index (in most cases this will be the S&P 500) on a trailing 12-month basis. Leveraged funds are not considered.
    

        One of the goals of this column is to highlight a variety of funds. While the Kinetics Paradigm fund was the best-performing fund in January, as shown below, we featured the fund and its manager, Peter Doyle, as BI's Investor of the Month in both October and November. Going forward, we'll update the leaderboard so readers can track the year's top performers alongside our monthly selections.

81,2025-02-04,"Today’s Forbes Daily covers the stock market’s reaction to Trump’s tariff policies, Elon Musk’s work with USAID, a new lawsuit against the Treasury Department, plus an offer from El Salvador. 
President Donald Trump’s tariffs could make cheap goods from China more expensive, but not just because of the levy itself.
Trump imposed a 10% tariff on Chinese goods today—prompting China to retaliate with a plan for additional taxes on the U.S.—while 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports will be delayed for one month.
But also targeted in the import taxes is the “de minimis” trade provision, which allows companies to send packages valued at $800 or less to the U.S. without being taxed. Low-cost retailers like Temu and Shein rely on this exemption, and the U.S. processed more than 1.3 billion de minimis shipments in 2024.
As of late 2023, there was bipartisan support in Congress to overhaul the tax break, which critics say gives such companies an unfair advantage, and former President Joe Biden’s Administration proposed closing the loophole.
Protesters gather outside of the headquarters of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management on Monday.
The American Federation of Government Employees and other unions sued the Treasury Department on Monday, seeking to cut the Department of Government Efficiency’s access to data after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reportedly greenlit a plan to provide department data to the Elon Musk-led agency last weekend. The New York Times reported the Treasury’s payment systems have been “closely held,” citing the personal data held within them, including that of Americans who receive tax refunds, Social Security checks and other federal government payments.
The Trump Administration threw higher education officials into a panic last week when the Office of Management and Budget issued a memo ordering federal agencies to halt outgoing grants and loans—effectively cutting off colleges and universities from billions in research and administrative funding (though the freeze has since been stalled). For some schools, even a temporary pause in this revenue stream could wreak havoc on their research apparatuses, but the universities with giant endowments are well-equipped to handle a freeze.
MORE: U.S. District Judge Loren L. AliKhan said the federal government must tell agencies not to implement Trump’s federal funding freeze, with Monday’s move marking the third time the judge has ruled against the freeze.

The stock market tumbled Monday morning as Wall Street digested President Donald Trump’s tariffs set to go into effect Tuesday, then recovered some after Mexican levies were paused. The companies hardest hit by the tariff slide largely fell into four buckets: alcoholic beverage purveyors, automakers, multinational technology firms with heavy China exposure and cryptocurrency-focused companies.
MORE: As the stock market reacted to the tariffs, nobody lost more money Monday than the world’s richest person and Trump backer Elon Musk, as Tesla stock fell 5%. The dip knocked $11.8 billion off Musk’s net worth, according to Forbes’ real-time billionaires list, by far the biggest loss of any billionaire.
""This is a great country to have some drive, because you can pretty much accomplish anything,"" says Fernando De Leon, the founder of Leon Capital.
Fernando De Leon has one of the more unusual backstories of those on the Forbes Billionaires list—though he grew up in Mexico, he was born a U.S. citizen after his mother crossed into Texas to give birth. He recently told Forbes some of the secrets to his success, which include building businesses that improve lives, immersing yourself in many cultures and studying the competition to exploit their weaknesses.
During her first stint in the White House, First Lady Melania Trump showed little interest in profiting from politics. But this time, she’s taking a page out of her husband’s book, releasing a memoir as well as her digital memecoin, the latter of which could have made her $400 million or more.
Tesla’s fourth-quarter earnings were worse than expected, its near-term outlook is murky and Elon Musk is more distracted than ever. But with ever-loyal shareholders and a cowed board, he’s not going anywhere. “If you buy the stock, you have to accept that it’s not going to be like a regular company. It’s Elon’s private company that is public for some reason,” said one wealth manager.
As the battle for AI supremacy heats up, the European Union is writing a $56 million check for researchers to build a large language model to rival its American and Chinese competitors. The investment, while just a tiny fraction of the money pouring into leading American AI labs like OpenAI, will fund top researchers from a handful of companies and universities across EU countries as they develop an open source LLM that can work with the trading bloc’s 30 languages.
SpaceX's Starlink has been beneficial to Ukraine's war effort, though Musk has threatened to cut access before.
Even as Elon Musk has said his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been given permission to shut down USAID, he’s also done business with it. Over the last four years, the U.S. government’s humanitarian and development arm has spent $500,000 on SpaceX’s Starlink terminals bringing them to Zimbabwe and South Africa, the country where Musk was born. USAID also worked with SpaceX to send 5,000 Starlink terminals, worth some $3 million, to Ukraine in 2022.
President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday establishing a sovereign wealth fund for the United States, a state-owned fund that can invest in assets like stocks, real estate and bonds to insulate the government from economic stressors. The U.S. has traditionally not needed a sovereign wealth fund, as the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury are capable of managing similar long-term investments.
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio meets with El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele at his residence in El Salvador on Tuesday.
El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele offered to house criminals from any nationality deported from the U.S.—including “dangerous criminals” who are American citizens—in his country’s jails, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Monday. Rubio added that no country has “ever made an offer of friendship such as this” and hailed it as the “most unprecedented and extraordinary migratory agreement anywhere in the world.”
Disney World in Orlando, Florida is a perennial top destination for Canadian travelers.
In response to the threat of U.S. tariffs, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau urged citizens to reconsider visiting the U.S., which has the U.S. hospitality industry bracing for huge losses. Canadian visitors make up the single largest group of foreign inbound tourists to the U.S., and even a 10% reduction in Canadian travel could mean $2.1 billion in lost spending, according to projections from the U.S. Travel Association.
Francis Pedraza
TOPLINE AI training has quickly become a crowded field with clickworker factories like Scale, Surge and Turing vying for the same jobs. But while Scale, living up to its name, raised $1 billion at a $14 billion valuation last year on $1 billion of annualized revenue, Francis Pedraza is deliberately plotting a different path for his company Invisible.
The firm raised only $23 million from investors, a drop in the bucket given the ongoing AI frenzy. And rather than selling off chunks of equity to more VCs, Invisible has been buying back its shares. “We could not be more different,” says Pedraza, who retains an estimated 10% stake in the business, which was last valued at $500 million in 2023.
Pedraza has borrowed $20 million over the last three years to buy out his early investors. “I believed that our equity would 10x in value, so it was an amazing arbitrage,” he says.
Pedraza thinks it’s a win-win. He gets more control. His early VCs—who long ago probably wrote their investments down to zero—get a clean exit.
As he slowly reestablishes himself (and his employees) as the sole owners of Invisible, he has suitably ambitious plans. Target one: Accenture and its fat $245 billion market cap. Pedraza is betting that his clickworkers are not only smarter and cheaper, but that Invisible’s inside track on AI training will help him automate tasks faster than Accenture.
WHY IT MATTERS It’s a bold move, and unusual among VC-backed startups. Is paying interest the best use of Invisible’s limited funds? “You’d have to be confident to put on a big stack of debt just to lower people’s dilutions,” says David Wanek, CEO of one of Silicon Valley’s oldest debt funds, Western Technology.

As trade wars heat up, many are wondering how tariffs work and how they’ll impact Americans. Economists predict price increases for items like cars, oil, food and alcohol:

Around 2.5%: What the U.S.’ existing tariffs on some products amount to

In order to set prices and plan for the future, businesses need clarity on trade policy. That's why even the threat of President Donald Trump's tariffs could increase US housing costs.

        Even if Trump ends up coming to a permanent deal with the US' North American partners and rescinding his proposed levies, the uncertainty surrounding his policy choices could inflate building material costs by disrupting supply chains and homebuilder timelines, even as the US struggles to build its way out of a severe housing shortage.
    

        ""Uncertainty is an impediment to investment, particularly those involving those large capital outlays,"" Matt Saunders, a senior VP at John Burns Research and Consulting, told Business Insider. ""If there's persistent uncertainty, that risk has to be priced into markets.""
    

        Meanwhile, housing economists and homebuilder industry groups say the president's new tariffs on Chinese imports will inflate homebuilding costs by raising prices for certain electronic appliances required in many homes.
    

        Canada, Mexico, and China are the US's top trading partners, and they provide a significant portion of the materials the construction industry needs. Canadian lumber, Mexican gypsum used for drywall, and Chinese electronics are among the most critical building materials impacted by the new and potential levies, industry experts said.
    

        While Trump announced on Monday that he would pause 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada for 30 days after reaching agreements with the countries involving enhanced border security, 10% tariffs on China went into effect just after midnight on Tuesday. Beijing retaliated by imposing tariffs on some US goods, including coal and gas, and announcing an antitrust investigation into Google.
    

        Higher prices for imported building materials would push housing costs up and result in a slower rate of construction and fewer homes being built, compounding housing affordability issues, they said.
    

        For example, as uncertainty around Trump's trade moves persists, a Canadian lumber company could hold back on growing its capacity, Anirban Basu, chief economist at the construction industry trade group Associated Builders and Contractors, told Business Insider. This would further reduce supply and inflate consumer prices.
    

        ""Even if the tariffs are not implemented, as long as there's the threat of them, it's inflationary,"" Basu said. ""One of the things I hear from business leaders is this: all we want is certainty. Give us certainty about your zoning decisions. Give us certainty about your regulatory decisions. Whether it's state, local, or federal, give us certainty.""
    

        If the 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico go into effect after the temporary pause, in addition to the tariffs on Chinese imports, they would increase the cost of the average newly constructed home by an estimated $40,000 — about a 10% price hike, Basu said.
    

        Basu estimates tariffs on lumber would raise the cost of building a typical new US home by $8,000 to $12,000. The US imports about 30% of its softwood lumber — used in the framing of most homes — from Canada, and lumber costs make up between 15 and 20% of the total cost of building a typical home, Saunders said. At the same time, tariffs on Chinese products like plumbing fixtures, appliances, windows, and doors would add about $8,000 to the cost of construction, while increased concrete and cement would add around $3,000.
    

        ""If you reduce supply at the time when you're trying to increase construction — simple math, you're going to make it more expensive and harder to source,"" Brian Turmail, VP of public affairs at the industry group the Associated General Contractors of America, told Business Insider. ""And if people can't source it, then they're going to put longer timelines in their bids.""
    

        This is particularly challenging given that home-building materials are already 40% more expensive than they were pre-pandemic, Saunders added.
    

        There's historical precedent for price hikes as a result of tariffs. Trump's 2018 tariffs on washing machines from China and his 2019 tariffs on Chinese furniture sent consumer prices for those products soaring, Saunders said.
    

        The vast majority — 87% — of homebuilders said variability in materials costs would have a negative impact on their operations, according to a recent survey by research firm John Burns.
    

        The National Association of Homebuilders, a major trade group, slammed Trump's proposed tariffs on Saturday, saying they would do the ""opposite"" of the president's promise to lower housing costs and boost the supply of homes.
    

        ""Tariffs on lumber and other building materials increase the cost of construction and discourage new development, and consumers end up paying for the tariffs in the form of higher home prices,"" Carl Harris, chairman of the NAHB, said in a statement.
    

        Basu believes tariffs could have a long-term inflationary impact as they could hurt smaller foreign suppliers and weaken industry supply chains.
    

        ""All of a sudden, industry capacity is constrained, it's diminished, and that leads to more market power among those who survive in the industry, which leads to higher prices,"" he said.

The Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles aren't the only ones getting ready for the Super Bowl.

Tubi, the Fox-owned free streaming service, is preparing to air the Big Game for the first time. But its sights are set on what happens after the final whistle.
    

        Tubi marketing chief Nicole Parlapiano told Business Insider that the service wants to show viewers and advertisers that it has reached its ""credibility era"" as a destination for high-quality entertainment.
    

        ""I think there can be a stigma on the free services,"" Parlapiano said. ""People think, if it's free, it must not be premium or might not have the things they want. So getting them on the product to see that isn't true is extremely powerful.""
    

        She added that Tubi wanted to demonstrate to advertisers that free TV is something people view intentionally and not just in the background.
    

        Tubi will simulcast the Chiefs-Eagles clash produced by Fox Sports in 4K on any phone, computer, or connected TV — with no credit-card information or account set-up required.
    

        Parlapiano said the streamer would also air its own shoulder programming for people who aren't sports fanatics but want to participate in the Super Bowl as a cultural event. These will be promoted via a tile in the app. The highlight of this effort will be a fashion-focused pre-game show hosted by influencer and model Olivia Culpo. Her husband, Christian McCaffrey, played for the San Francisco 49ers in last year's Super Bowl.
    

        ""If you are one of the girlies who doesn't care about anything besides who's there and what they're wearing, then it'll be very clear that's the place for you,"" Parlapiano said.
    

        Tubi launched in 2014 and was acquired by Fox in 2020 for $440 million.
    

        It was the fastest-growing streaming service in 2023 and is especially popular among Gen Z. The service said in 2024 that it had reached 97 million monthly active users. Tubi made up 1.7% of TV viewing in December, according to Nielsen. That put it ahead of some major paid services like Peacock, Paramount+, and Max.
    

        ""People know that we've gotten bigger, but they don't know why,"" Parlapiano said. ""I want to leave that not as a question after this night.""
    

        Many may already associate Tubi with the Super Bowl, thanks to a breakthrough commercial. When Fox last carried the Big Game two years ago, the streamer created panic with what Parlapiano called a ""stunty"" ad that made many people think that someone had sat on the remote.
    

        ""We took a lot of risks back then, and it kind of set the pace for how we approached the business in the past two and a half years,"" Parlapiano said.
    

        Tubi's marketing team took a more conventional approach to this year's Super Bowl. Its campaign features 15- and 60-second ads promoting Tubi as a streamer for specific viewing interests and will also promote new licensed offerings like ""Dune"" and original programs like ""Sidelined: The QB and Me,"" ""The Thicket,"" and ""The Z Suite"" — a new Gen-Z workplace show.
    

        Tubi has tried to set itself apart from other services by serving up a vast library of subgenres and cult favorites. To keep costs down, it licenses most of its content except for a small portion of originals.
    

        Fox has streamed sports on Tubi before when it wanted to get extra reach for games or didn't have room in its own schedule for them. It has streamed some Mexico Liga MX games, for example.
    

        Patrick Crakes, a media and sports consultant, said streaming the Super Bowl on Tubi has benefits for the league and Fox's advertisers, too.
    

        ""They'll reach some people who didn't have the pay TV bundle,"" he said. ""Everything Fox can drive to Tubi is incremental to them.""
    

        Tubi is a sub-scale streamer that's still not profitable. While airing live sports can make sense when there's an intersection with culture, it's not pushing into acquiring its own live (costly) sports. Fox is generally looking elsewhere for streaming options for its sports content. It's planning to launch a new paid streaming service and has a forthcoming skinny bundle with Disney's Fubo.
    

        ""Having live sports all the time is a completely different muscle,"" Parlapiano said.
    

        She called the Super Bowl simulcast more of a stunt than a strategy change. She added that if it helps retain new viewers, Tubi could host more live events down the line.
    

        ""If there's opportunities where we can bring a frictionless entertainment experience to viewers, we'll always vet them,"" Parlapiano said.

(Bloomberg) -- Spotify Technology SA posted another quarter of better-than-expected subscriber growth in the fourth quarter, helping the Swedish music company record its first-ever annual profit.

Total active monthly users increased to 675 million, Spotify said in a statement on Tuesday. That compared with the average Wall Street estimate of 664.9 million, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The company also posted record-high subscriber additions, with paying customers increasing 11% to 263 million, also surpassing expectations.
Chief Executive Officer Daniel Ek has been pushing Spotify to expand beyond its dominant position in music streaming, adding audiobooks, podcasts and video, luring more paying subscribers despite two rounds of price increases in a little more than a year. Combined with eliminating some 1,500 jobs, that has helped deliver Spotify’s first full-year profit since it launched in 2008. The company reported net income of €1.14 billion ($1.2 billion) for all of 2024.
Ek acknowledged the company’s transformation, noting that for its first 16 years, Spotify was focused on “driving meaningful scale. We did not worry about profitability,” he said on a conference call with analysts. “Through cost reductions, but then also through the year of monetization, I think we’re now proving that we’re a great business too.”
Ek expects the company to continue on its profitable growth trajectory this year, coining 2025 “the year of accelerated execution.” Spotify can “pick up the pace dramatically when it comes to our product velocity,” he said. “We’re going to double down on music, and we’re going to be disciplined doing it.”
In the first quarter, the company expects to add 3 million monthly active users and about 2 million premium subscribers, the company said. Revenue is expected to rise from a year ago to €4.2 billion and gross margin will hit 31.5%, driven by increasing premium subscriptions.
Spotify shares, which gained 138% last year, rose as much as 11% to a record high of $606.95 as trading got underway in New York.
Earlier this year, Spotify launched a new video-creator offering that will compensate contributors based on how much content viewers consume rather than having to rely on ads. The move pits Spotify even more directly against YouTube in the growing market for video podcasts.
Spotify already has more than 300,000 video podcasts on its platform as some 70% of eligible shows and networks have already opted in, Chief Product and Technology Officer Gustav Soderstrom said on the call. The company hosts a total of about 6 million podcasts. “We’re incredibly pleased with these early results and we will continue to innovate from here,” he said.
Spotify also triumphed in a court case against a music royalties collection service that tried to argue the service’s bundled subscription, which includes audiobooks and music, was illegitimate.
In January, Spotify reached a new distribution agreement with Universal Music Group NV that takes into account Spotify’s new business model including new pricing tiers and bundling music and non-music content. Ek said he sees the deal as a “win-win” situation for the music streamer and the record company and sets Spotify up for strong growth. “If we grow, our label partners and ecosystem will benefit from this too,” Ek said, without providing more details of the deal.

A developer is planning to power a data center in Ohio by building a natural gas-fired plant on the site, a public filing showed.

        Lawyers for Powerconnex Inc. notified the Ohio Power Siting Board last week of the company's plans to build the plant, which would serve as the data center's primary source of electricity. The power generation facility, named the New Albany Energy Center, and the data center would be built on the same 48.6-acre site in New Albany, Ohio.
    

        Construction on the plant is expected to start as soon as the fourth quarter of 2025, according to the letter. This means the data center could be up and running by the first quarter of 2026.
    

        It would have a generating capacity of up to 120 megawatts, which is enough electricity to power a large hyperscale data center by today's standards. However, it's a fraction of the electricity developers of AI megaprojects have said they'll need. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, for instance, said the company is building a data center in Louisiana with over two gigawatts of capacity.
    

        The data center development boom has caused electricity demand to surge in the US after nearly two decades of stagnation. Data centers are energy-intensive facilities that run 24/7, and as Big Tech continues to push into artificial intelligence, their projected future energy use is expected to create an enormous strain on the country's electric grid. Frustrated by regulatory bottlenecks in crowded data center markets, developers are seeking alternative solutions, Jones Lang LaSalle said in a report last month.
    

        Already, developers are facing regulatory bottlenecks in crowded data center markets, and are seeking out alternative solutions — like building on-site power plants — to waiting for access to the grid.
    

        Business Insider reported last week that developers for an Oracle data center in Abilene, Texas — widely thought to be the first Project Stargate location — are building a 360.5-megawatt natural gas turbine plant to help power it. This sort of arrangement is known as ""behind-the-meter"" in the utilities industry — it means that the electric generating facility is not connected to the grid, and local utilities can't monitor or measure its use.
    

        Christine Pirik, a Dickinson Wright attorney representing Powerconnex, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Pirik is a former deputy legal director for both the Ohio Power Siting Board, which grants permits for electric generating facilities, and Ohio's Public Utilities Commission.
    

        Business Insider could not confirm who is behind Powerconnex Inc. However, there is a Virginia-based Powerconnex Inc. that shares a business address and three executive officers with data center company EdgeConnex.
    

        EdgeConnex operates over 80 data centers in the US, Europe, and Asia. It is developing a data center in New Albany, Ohio, according to its website. In September, private credit company Sixth Street Partners announced it had acquired a minority stake in EdgeConneX.
    

        New Albany, Ohio, a rural suburb northeast of Columbus, is home to several major data center projects. Amazon has committed to spending more than $23 billion on data center development in the state, and Microsoft, Meta, and Google also have projects in Ohio.
    

        Recently, electricity demand in the region has soared. AEP Ohio, the Columbus utility that serves the major data centers, said last year that it had received 30 gigawatts of service requests. It asked state regulators to approve a separate rate class specifically for data center customers to protect other ratepayers from incurring additional costs due to the facilities' demand. Hearings for the matter were held in January, although the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio has not yet issued a final order.

Season 2 is live in Call of Duty: Warzone, bringing small map changes, more perks, and a host of quality-of-life improvements. Season 2 also adds three new weapons and some impactful weapon balancing, so you'll want to reconsider adjusting your weapon builds. Here we recommend the best weapon loadouts to try across standard battle royale and Resurgence matches of Warzone.
Make sure to also check out our guide for recommended Black Ops 6 multiplayer loadouts for Season 2.
Raven Software continues to make weapon adjustments, with two additional updates making major balancing changes to Warzone's weapon pool. This heavily nerfs the once popular XM4 and Jackal PDW guns. The Buffer Weight Stock attachment is also nerfed and no longer a viable option for your weapon builds.
Thanks to the XM4 nerfs, the Model L assault rifle is now one of the best long-range weapons in the game. The recommended attachments for the weapon will boost the ammo count as well as increase the damage range and bullet velocity.
If you want to run the Gunfighter Wildcard, also throw on the Commando Grip, Balanced Stock, and the 5.56 NATO Overpressured fire mod.
The Ames 85 moved to the top of the list for long-range options. The recommended attachments will help with handling and damage range. The Reinforced barrel is great for Resurgence maps, but if you want a bit more bullet velocity for Urzikstan, then swap it for the Gain-Twist Barrel.
If you want to run the Gunfighter Wildcard, also throw on the Commando Grip, Balanced Stock, and the 5.56 NATO Overpressured fire mod.
The recent buff to Season 2's new Feng 82 mow makes this light machine gun a solid choice for long-range combat. The recommended attachments will help increase bullet velocity, improve handling, and boost the ammo count.
If you want to run the Gunfighter Wildcard, you can also add the Quickdraw rear grip, Balanced Stock, and the 5.56 NATO Overpressured fire mod.

Season 2's new Cypher 091 isn't quite as easy-to-use as the Model L, but it's a strong contender in long-range options for Warzone. The recommended attachments will help improve the handling, increase bullet velocity, and boost the ammo count.
If you want to run the Gunfighter Wildcard, also throw on the Commando Grip, Balanced Stock, and the 7.62 Overpressured fire mod.

Season 2's nerf for the Jackal PDW has dethroned the most popular submachine gun in Warzone, letting the C9 rise as the most powerful and well-rounded gun for close-range fights. The recommended attachments will provide you with more recoil control, extra bullet velocity, and additional ammo.
If you want to run the Gunfighter Wildcard, throw on an optic, the Balance Stock, and the Recoil Springs fire mod.

Season 2 returned the iconic PPSh-41 submachine gun to Call of Duty, and thanks to a recent buff, this is now a strong choice for close-range playstyles in Warzone. It does have more visual effects with smoke and muzzle flash, but the recommended muzzle will help reduce some of this.
If you want to run the Gunfighter Wildcard, you can use the Volzhskiy Reflex optic, the Fast Motion laser, and the Recoil Springs fire mod.

The KSV submachine gun is a great choice to build for a sniper support weapon. The recommended attachments will help provide the KSV with more recoil control, extra bullet velocity, and additional ammo.
If you want to run the Gunfighter Wildcard, you can include the Target Laser, Commando Grip rear grip, and the Overpressured fire mod.

The LR 7.62 sniper rifle is one of the best options for sniping in Warzone. The recommended attachments will boost the damage range and increase the weapon's mobility.
If you want a more powerful Gunfighter build, add the Target Laser, Combat Stock, and Extended Mag I.

I honestly can't get mad at Nomad since they are one of the few truly innovative companies in the Apple accessories market. You can hate their prices, but you can't hate the products, which deliver bespoke levels of quality and unique, very smart designs. But even by Nomad standards, $100 for a cable is one helluva horse pill price tag. Yikes. Apple, which is known for its pricey cables, charges $29 fora 1-meter fast-charging Apple Watch puck. But Nomad's $70 upcharge for an extra 1/2 meter of cable and USB-C makes Apple look like Temu.

That seems like quite a lot weight to be supported by a single USB-C port. Especially in that picture where the puck-end of the cable is plugged into the laptop and then the Apple Watch is placed on top of the puck. And (seemingly) none of that weight is being supported by the desk. It’s all (seemingly) the USB-C port.I (possibly) damaged an iPad Pro USB-C port a few months ago by having (maybe) too much weight being supported by a single port. Maybe. I don’t know that for sure. It could have been some other reason why the port got damaged. But ever since then I’ve been more mindful about things like that.I mean… it’s probably not that big a deal if you are careful about it. But at a $100… that’s a lot of ask for. You can buy an authentic 1m Apple USB-C cable and an authentic 1m Apple Watch cable twice each (four charging cables total) at full MSRP for less than one Nomad cable. Full MSRP Apple Tax and that four cable example is still $4 cheaper, lol.And for $100… that Nomad cable is still only USB 2.0 transfer speed? Granted, the Apple cable in my example is also USB 2.0. But the Apple cable — and this is important — isn’t $100, lol.

88,2025-02-04,"Plus: Two In Five Executives Feel Unprepared For Market Shocks, Interest Rates Hold Steady For Now, Trump Creates A U.S. Sovereign Wealth Fund, Unions Score Wins While The NRLB Gets A Loss
The whipsawing news about tariffs and trade wars during the last few days has caused confusion, quick calculations and frantic negotiations between global business partners. However, according to BCG’s most recent Executive Perspectives study, 85% of businesses have been preparing for this eventuality since Donald Trump won the presidential election in November, and more than 60% of executives have increased concerns about tariffs.
Does that mean they’re ready for all that’s been going on? Not exactly. The study found that two in five executives feel unprepared for this latest round of market shocks, despite the previous five years characterized by market shocks: the Covid-19 pandemic, supply chain issues, war in Ukraine and the Middle East and high inflation. The balance of executives’ outlook toward market stability has also shifted this year. In North America, just 29% are optimists—a drop of 6% from 2024—while 19% are pessimists—an increase of 4% from last year.
Business leaders’ financial mettle has been tested vigorously over the last few days with a raft of announcements about tariffs. On Friday, President Trump said he was enacting his first set of tariffs, which were to go into effect today: 25% on imports from Mexico and Canada, and 10% on China. Global markets dropped, and leaders went into negotiating mode. By the end of the day Monday, tariffs on Mexico and Canada were postponed for 30 days—Mexico promised to deploy 10,000 Mexican soldiers to the border to prevent drug trafficking, and Canada is spending $1.3 billion on a joint task force designed to combat fentanyl, organized crime and money laundering. China’s tariffs are beginning as planned, with the Asian nation placing retaliatory 15% tariffs on several American-made goods, as well as U.S. companies.
This type of news is difficult to keep up with, let alone use to forecast your business plans. And while many companies prepared for potential tariffs on China last year, steep tariffs on Mexico and Canada weren’t in many companies’ viewfinders. Forbes senior contributor Michael Lynch writes that how Trump appears to be using tariffs so far—as a threat unless other countries do something the United States wants—makes it especially difficult for U.S. businesses. The tariffs are largely unrelated to business outcomes.
Even without the open question of tariffs, the U.S. economy is in a volatile situation right now, as quick decisions have far reverberations. Stephan Liozu, chief value officer at financial software company Zilliant, says that companies can do much better if CFOs have a handle on pricing and can make quick changes to respond to the larger economic situation. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks after last week's Open Market Committee meeting.
The seesawing news on tariffs rocked the markets this week. In the U.S., all markets fell on Monday morning, but recovered slightly after Trump announced the pause on Mexico’s tariffs. However, the three major indexes closed down—the Dow down 0.3%, the S&P lost 0.8% and the Nasdaq minus 1.2%. The pause on Canada’s tariffs was announced after markets closed on Monday, and stocks slowly moved toward a recovery.
But tariffs are far from the only decision of the last week that’s shaped the economic picture. Last week the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee decided to hold interest rates steady at 4.25% to 4.5%. It was the first meeting since July at which rates were not cut. In the announcement, the committee noted unemployment “has stabilized at a low level” and “inflation remains somewhat elevated.” Trump responded to the Fed’s decision with a Truth Social post saying the body “has done a terrible job on Bank Regulation. But Forbes senior contributor Simon Moore notes that tariffs tend to be paid for by consumers and U.S. companies in terms of higher prices, potentially increasing inflation—and therefore lowering the chances of additional rate cuts.
Inflation and economic stagnation are persisting. Commerce Department data released on Friday showed that inflation remained sticky, with the personal consumption expenditures index at 2.6% in December. GDP only rose 2.3% in the fourth quarter, slower than expected.
President Donald Trump, between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent at left and Commerce Secretary nominee Howard Lutnick, speaks to the press as he signs an executive order to create a U.S. sovereign wealth fund.
New policy choices are also potentially reshaping the U.S.’s financial picture. On Monday, President Trump signed an executive order establishing a U.S. sovereign wealth fund—a state-owned fund that can invest in stocks, real estate, bonds, hedge funds and more that can insulate the government from economic stress. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it would be set up in the next 12 months, though it’s unclear where the money will come from. Trump said that perhaps TikTok could be put into this sovereign fund “if we make the right deal.”
In his first week in office, Trump signed an order to create a working group on cryptocurrency, potentially creating a national digital asset stockpile, wrote Forbes senior contributor Jason Brett. Trump has been interested in cryptocurrency throughout his campaign, with his family creating the World Liberty Financial crypto venture last year, and $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins issued right before the inauguration. Former Forbes staffer Steven Ehrlich talked to former chair of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission Timothy Massad about Trump’s crypto ventures. Massad said it’s good that the administration is focusing on digital assets and is hopeful it will lead to a framework encouraging responsible development of the tech, but he sees no need for a strategic crypto reserve.
A Costco Wholesale store in Chicago.
Polling has shown that recent union success has increased the number of Americans who like them, with workers unions receiving a 70% approval rating on a Gallup poll, writes Forbes senior contributor Teresa Ghilarducci. According to the Labor Department, 9.9% of the workforce was in a union in 2024, down slightly from 10% the year prior. But organized labor may face an uncertain future. Last week, Trump fired Democrat National Labor Relations Board member Gwynne Wilcox, leaving the board with just two members and unable to conduct business. Her dismissal may be challenged in court.
In the last week, organized labor had earned some big wins. Costco reached a last-minute tentative contract agreement with about 18,000 employees in the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union, averting a strike that would have started over the weekend, affecting more than 50 Costco locations nationwide, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. Employees at a Philadelphia Whole Foods location also voted last week to join the United Food and Commercial Workers union, Danziger writes. The next step is for the union to negotiate a contract with the grocery chain’s owner, Amazon, which has just one unionized warehouse under its flagship business.
Zilliant Chief Value Officer Stephan Liozu.
From the looks of it, price management software Zilliant Chief Value Officer Stephan Liozu believes we’re entering a period of hyperinflation, with costs going up and down all the time. For companies to perform better in times like this, he said CFOs need to have a better handle on and control of pricing—something that four in five companies don’t have a team dedicated to looking at. I talked to him about how companies should look at prices and plan for an uncertain future. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity.
How should prices be set?
Liozu: I recommend the three Cs of pricing. You have to know your cost inside and out, and now the cost is changing on a minute[-by-minute] basis. That’s very dynamic and includes goods coming from outside, inside.
The second C is competition. You need to anticipate what your competitors are going to do. How are we going to manage that hybrid inflation and tariffs? Are we going to do it better than you? Are they going to raise or decrease prices, et cetera?
Then you have customer value. Right now, the perceptions of value are changing, and that means that you need to be aware that they might consider your offers, your product or services differently.
The three Cs are in play constantly, and these three Cs are informing smart pricing decisions. Unfortunately, most companies will look at cost only, especially in periods of stagflation and inflation, but they need to really anticipate what competition is going to do and also the perceptions of value from consumers.
What advice would you give to CFOs today that are trying to figure all this out?
Number one is to take ownership of pricing. If no one is doing it and you don’t have a pricing team, create a task force, create a council and make sure you bring all these parties at the table, and say: OK, we’re going to do this better in a dynamic way, and with the right data.
Number two is look at how pricing is managed, how long it takes you to do updates. Make a case for better investment in faster systems [for] optimization, automation. It pays for itself in six months when you look at money you save on not giving the right price to the market.
Number three, I would say rethink your strategy with the three Cs. Most CFOs will go and focus on cost cutting, cost optimization and doing the calculations. Don’t forget competition and value because there is still a lot of value that can be captured from customers. There are a lot of strategies you could do in products and services to increase the value for the price.
We’ve been in a period of disruption for a long time—the Covid-19 pandemic, supply chain issues, war in Ukraine and the Middle East, and high inflation. But when things finally settle down again, do you think this focus on dynamic pricing will stay? 
Right now, disruption is the new constant. Based on how things are right now with China, Russia and trends around the world, we’re going to see ongoing disruption for the next 10 to 20 years. Which means you need to be automating, you need to have dynamic processes and systems, and you need to adapt your DNA to this kind of environment. If your company’s not prepared for that type of change, then you’re going to disappear.
The CFO needs to raise that flag in the C-suite, but also has the responsibility to make sure on the side of risk management, this is managed internally. Because shareholders are going to look at this, and say, what are you doing?

Recession is one thing business people are always worried about. Is it around the corner? As stated by Goldman Sachs in January 2023, the probability rate was 35%. The global financial environment has caused it to lower its estimation to nearly 15% due to continuously rising GDP and upbeat investor sentiments. On the other hand, J.P. Morgan Research has raised its probability estimate from a 25% chance of a recession by the end of 2024 and 35% by the second half of 2025 to 45% by the end of 2025.
Given these different probability rates from major financial institutions within the country, I'd like to share where I envisage the U.S. economy is headed.
Indeed, the growth of the U.S. economy has turned sluggish and is far from as sound as before.
The unemployment rate in the U.S. rose to 14.8% in April 2020, a time that saw the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic across the country. It went back down to 3.5% by the end of 2022, further reducing to 3.4% in April 2023 because of the multiple employment opportunities created after the country’s economy sprang back from the effects of the pandemic. However, the unemployment figures then began to go back up; the most recent available data shows that the unemployment rate was at 4.1% in December 2024.
The Sahm rule came into play when the unemployment rate hit a 2024 high of 4.2% in July (a high matched in August and November). According to this rule, when the average three-month unemployment rate is 0.5% higher than the lowest figure in a year, that country is in a recession. In this case, the three-month moving average stood at an average rate of 4.2%, 0.7% above the lowest rate of 3.5% since July 2023.
The U.S. stock market has also been volatile recently because of many significant occurrences, such as the recent increase in the interest rate by the Bank of Japan (BOJ). The rate was 0% to 0.1% for several years due to stagnation and nearly deflationary growth of consumer prices that in some years contracted. However, to reflect increasing wages and consumer costs, the BOJ made a bid to increase interest rates. This led to a significant influence on global stock markets, including the U.S. market.
Coupled with the high unemployment rate and other factors, this brought about a downturn in the U.S. stock market. The technology sector was perhaps the most affected. Amazon saw its stock plunge to a low of 39% in 2022 compared to its high. That same year, the story was similar with Microsoft, which was down by 16%, Apple, which was down by 13%, and many others. The sector still experiences some instability; Tesla is down by 30% so far this year.
There are some good notes on the health of the U.S. economy. For instance, the nominal GDP increased by 3.1% in the third quarter of 2024.
Also, consumer spending has improved from previous years and remains less affected by the slow economy. This means that despite a recession and high unemployment rates, spending is not declining. Even U.S. household debt has come down.
In the wake of the changes in the job market and inflation rates, the officials of the Federal Reserve reduced interest rates. The Fed cut another 25 basis points in November 2024, which fits their plans.
The slowdown will affect the ability of importing and exporting businesses to address bilateral trade finance needs. First, a slow economy tends to offer trade deficits that detrimentally affect supply chain finance. Second, a lack of capital from importers or exporters affects investors' sentiments, potentially leading to a financial crisis. Those countries relying most on the U.S. as a trading partner will be the most affected.
Digital trade financing can be a solid option for dealing with the decelerating U.S. economy. However, when trade slows down, companies' raw materials and merchandise, especially for local small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), may face struggles with the supply chain and, as a result, cash flow. With the help of digital finance trade platforms, business entities can take advantage of working capital without the need for security. This way, they can pay off suppliers on time, increase manufacturing capacity, accelerate production and even be prepared for any surges in consumer demand.
For instance, suppose an importer needs finances to get goods from a manufacturer in India or China. In that case, a trade finance platform could offer the required funds so that the importer can make 100% advanced payments. In some cases, this can enable SMEs to negotiate better terms with their suppliers, such as discounted rates, quicker delivery, etc.
Having access to required capital, whatever the source, can better ensure that small and medium businesses have the resources required to compete with large organizations in a slowing U.S. economy.

If you have a newer vehicle, there's a good chance it lets you run Android Auto wirelessly. Plenty of others on the road don't offer that kind of luxury, and frankly, some aren't even that old. This was always the premise behind AAWireless as an adapter to bridge that gap. The AAWireless Two smooths out the rougher edges of the original and makes it easier to set up and use.
The main focus remains the same, which is to enable you to run wireless Android Auto where it's not possible. It's just that you can also share the connectivity with other drivers or passengers along the way.

AAWireless Two first launched in October 2024 and, unlike its predecessor, didn't come with a crowdfunding campaign. The best places to find it are on Amazon and its own website, where it sells for $65. The only catch is availability, which fluctuates based on inventory from the European manufacturer. That's cheaper than the original AAWireless, which has basically been retired.

The most obvious difference in this second iteration is that it's about half the size of the previous model. That puts it more in line with what other brands, especially those based in China, are bringing to market. These types of dongles and adapters keep getting smaller.
As they slim down in size, they're becoming easier to set up and manage. Mind you, the ""manage"" part is very relative because most others are simple ""set it and forget it"" types. Not so with the AAWireless Two, which encourages usability and customization however it can provide it.
Much of that comes from the button on the device, whose main function is to switch between paired phones or place the connection on ""standby.""

AAWireless even lets you map the buttons within the limited parameters available. The point is that it makes it significantly easier to pair multiple devices and swap between them while on the road. Not only should it make road trips or commutes simpler, but it also allows drivers sharing the same car to utilize the wireless Android Auto connection. The one catch here is anyone connecting to this must use an Android phone. There's no Apple CarPlay here (except an AAWireless Two Plus model supporting it is coming in 2025).
The LED ring light is highly visible and easy to interpret, with solid blue confirming a phone is connected and running Android Auto. A single or double-click can switch over to another phone — a process that's impressively quick.
I liked it all the more because the original AAWireless came with inconsistent connectivity, particularly on ignition. That smoothed over with subsequent firmware updates, but this sequel is already off to a good start. From the initial setup to connection stability, the Two delivers.
It's also pretty seamless to pair a second phone.
It's also pretty seamless to pair a second phone. All I had to do was press and hold the button until it flashed purple (indicating pairing mode) and then pair the second phone via the Bluetooth settings. Once done, the app lets you choose which device to prioritize first every time, or you can opt to have it first go to whichever phone it last connected with.
The process is sturdy throughout, and I found just pressing the button on the adapter was good enough to switch phones when necessary. It also proves super convenient with phone calls in case your partner or passenger needs to make a call and wants to use the car stereo as a speaker.

The app's settings include a slew of extra features and controls, most of which you probably won't even need to consider.
One is ""Audio stutter fix,"" a setting you'll want to toggle on if you encounter audio issues at any time while using the AAWireless Two. That said, Android Auto is supposed to set the buffer for audio playback to ensure it keeps playing without fail. If there's a problem, setting it to ""Unlimited"" should solve it.
AAWireless also brings back Passthrough as a means to play around with defaults, like adjusting the DPI (dots per inch) displayed and more. There are several other options in the settings in the app, but the disclaimer notes to ""please make sure you know what you're doing"" before trying them.

The first few times, the AAWireless Two connects took longer than usual. The delay eventually corrects itself as things are set up but it is a bit jarring if you're used to more immediate access to Android Auto like you get with a wired connection.
Naturally, a wired connection means you're also charging your phone at the same time. If your car has a wireless charging pad, you can take advantage of that anytime. It's still a good idea to keep charging cables inside to charge the device whenever you need them.
Make sure to keep a USB-C-to-USB-C cable handy in case your car doesn't have USB-A ports. The included cable here is only a short USB-C-to-USB-A. There's also no adhesive pad included to keep the adapter upright on the dash — less of an issue with the previous one but more important here because of the phone-switching feature.
Then there's general availability. Unlike other similar adapters, the AAWireless Two is manufactured in Europe, so inventory tends to come in waves, meaning you'll have to catch one to get your hands on this device.

It's hard to look at the AAWireless Two and not conclude it's the best of the bunch right now. Even more so given its predecessor occupied that spot before. Still, there are other dongles and devices that can run wireless Android Auto. The Motorola MA1 is recognizable by the name, but it's since been outshone by others.
The Carsifi is a good example; only app updates are like UFO sightings, and they're never around. But at least it lets you pair more than one phone. Carlinkit 5.0 is solid except for the clunky firmware update process and poorly written manual. It does the job if you only care to go wireless and never really interact with it thereafter.

You should buy this if...
You shouldn't buy this if...
Whether you're new to going wireless or have done it many times running Android Auto, what's not to like about it? I've used the word ""liberating"" before in the same context, and it feels just like that with the AAWireless Two.
Possibly more so because of how it seamlessly involves another user without any snags. In that sense, going wireless is already a win, and switching that privilege over to another is a win-win.


The AAWireless Two makes good on its predecessor's ability to run Android Auto wirelessly in any compatible vehicle, only now adds a seamless way to connect to two phones at once.

From the BLS: Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary 
The number of job openings decreased to 7.6 million on the last business day of December, the U.S. 
Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Over the month, hires and total separations were little 
changed at 5.5 million and 5.3 million, respectively. Within separations, quits (3.2 million) and layoffs 
and discharges (1.8 million) changed little.
emphasis added
The following graph shows job openings (black line), hires (dark blue), Layoff, Discharges and other (red column), and Quits (light blue column) from the JOLTS. 

This series started in December 2000.

Note: The difference between JOLTS hires and separations is similar to the CES (payroll survey) net jobs headline numbers. This report is for December; the employment report this Friday will be for January.

Note that hires (dark blue) and total separations (red and light blue columns stacked) are usually pretty close each month. This is a measure of labor market turnover.  When the blue line is above the two stacked columns, the economy is adding net jobs - when it is below the columns, the economy is losing jobs.

The spike in layoffs and discharges in March 2020 is labeled, but off the chart to better show the usual data.

Jobs openings decreased in December to 7.60 million from 8.12 million in November.
The number of job openings (black) were down 15% year-over-year. 

Quits were down 7% year-over-year.  These are voluntary separations. (See light blue columns at bottom of graph for trend for ""quits"").

Turntables get all the attention these days as part of the retro and nostalgia wave that continues to grip designs. In a few years, however, maybe CD players will already qualify as “old-school” as well and finally get some attention. At the moment, however, the majority of CD player designs do feel like they come from a different era, from a time when technical specifications weighed more heavily than aesthetics.
Fortunately, there are now a few design concepts that are trying to pull these consumer electronics to modern times. Some borrow a few cues from popular industrial design houses, while others go down an even more minimalist look. This particular design, for example, has very few visual cues that it’s a CD player, which is probably for the best as it stands as something like a decorative object when not in use.
Designer: Vladimir Dubrovin






Most CD player designs today fall under two categories. On one side you have the pure black boxes that you can connect to laptops or desktops, while the other side has designs that seem to have never grown up from the 90s. Yes, colors and a plethora of buttons never killed anyone, but the uniformity of style makes you wonder if that’s all that the market has to offer.

Thankfully, there are a few that try to break from the mold and embrace aesthetics that are more modern and less showy. A few minimalist designs here and there add a bit of variety to this overlooked market, making them look fresh even if their functionality hasn’t changed over the decades. Orion is one such concept that reduces the design to its most basic form but sprinkles enough details to keep it looking interesting.








The design is pretty much just a flat metal box with a powder-coated finish that gives it a bit of an industrial vibe. It doesn’t have a flap that flips open to reveal the CD player but instead invites you to slide the disc in through the thin slot from the front. Other than what may be a large eject button and an IR receiver in front, as well as a power cord socket at the back, there is very little in the way of distracting marks on this design.


It does, however, have plenty of perforations on the top surface, but unlike a cheese grater, these adopt a parametric design that makes the holes closer to the center bigger than those on the periphery. This adds a little flourish to what could be too clinical of a design, giving the Orion CD Player concept design a little character despite its minimalist appearance.

Shares of Denver-based software provider Palantir rose nearly 23% on February 4 following 2024 fourth quarter results featuring faster-than-expected growth and an optimistic forecast for the current quarter and the year 2025, according to CNBC.
Having risen 368% in the last year and sporting a price-earnings ratio of 516, according to the Wall Street Journal, do shares of Palantir have more upside? If Wall Street analysts are right, the stock is about 26% too high.
However, what matters most for the future of Palantir’s stock is whether the company can keep beating expectations and raising guidance.
That could happen – especially if Palantir – which counts Peter Thiel among the company’s early investors – can harness artificial intelligence to make its defense and commercial customers better off.
Palantir stock rose to a record after reporting “stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter results and guidance driven by AI,” noted CNBC. The company’s commercial revenue increased 64% in the quarter while U.S. government sales rose 45%.
Momentum at Palantir is “unlike anything that has come before,” CEO Alex Karp said, noted CNBC.
Here are the key numbers:
“We are at the way beginning of our trajectory, we are at the way beginning of a revolution, and we plan to be a cornerstone — if not the cornerstone company — and driving this revolution in the U.S. over the next three to five years,” Karp said during the company’s earnings call, noted CNBC.
Palantir has been known for national security work and has recently benefited from commercial and government adoption of the company’s AI platform.
Palantir expects federal budget cuts by the Elon Musk-run Department of Government Efficiency to add to the company’s growth. “Palantir’s real competition is a lack of accountability in government,” Palantir Chief Technology Officer Shyam Sankar told the company’s February 3 investor conference call, according to Bloomberg.
“DOGE is going to bring meritocracy and transparency to government,” he added.
Palantir’s technology is widely used by governments. The company’s customers include “all U.S. military branches and American allies in Ukraine and Israel,” noted Bloomberg.
Palantir’s artificial intelligence platform helps clients “pull together disparate collections of data into a single model that they then can build, train and deploy in their day-to-day processes,” reported TheStreet.
AIP is increasingly in demand. To wit, Palantir recently expanded a deal with the U.S. Army to as much as $619 million through 2028 while extending the company’s AI work with the U.S. Special Operations Command, Bloomberg noted.
Palantir’s ontology service -- a framework that helps represent and connect entities, data, and processes for its commercial clients -- is also in demand.
Palantir envisions replacing traditional defense firms with software-first companies. To that end, the company has enhanced an existing partnership with weapons-maker Anduril Industries.
Palantir also formed a new partnership with AI startup Anthropic “to bring its large language models to U.S. intelligence and defense operations,” Bloomberg reported.
Palantir sees tremendous growth ahead due to U.S. demand for AIP. ""America continues to rapidly embrace the AI revolution, and we saw this unrelenting demand drive impressive outperformance in our U.S. business,"" Palantir CFO Dave Glazer told investors on the conference call.
“Our U.S. commercial business is seeing unprecedented demand, with AIP driving both new customer conversions and existing-customer expansions in the U.S.,” Glazer added.
While the Wall Street consensus sees Palantir as overvalued, several analysts are revising their estimates upwards following the company’s latest report. More specifically, 17 Wall Street analysts set an average price target of $75.29 – making the stock about 26% over-valued, noted TipRanks.
Several Wall Street firms lifted their price targets. Palantir is an AI “value adder,” noted Bank of America’s Mariana Perez Mora.
Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to equal weight from underweight. “Given the strength of the outlook, we acknowledge that we were wrong about our core fundamental catalyst of slowing growth below the 30% level due to the tougher compares in 2025,” wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Sanjit Singh. “This leaves us with valuation as the primary remaining concern.”
D.A. Davidson lifted its price target 82% to $105 a share. “The winning continues” said D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria. “Palantir reported an outstanding quarter with revenue growth accelerating further due to relentless U.S. demand for AI solutions. Palantir remains well positioned to benefit from helping customers effectively utilize LLMs through its ontology,” he added.
Not all analysts see Palantir’s stock price rising. Indeed, Raymond James expressed enthusiasm about Palantir’s performance and concluded the company’s stock price fully incorporates its future growth.
Palantir’s Q1 revenue forecast reflects “strong exit velocity” from 2024 and “persistent AIP momentum and demand across virtually all markets,” noted Raymond James analyst Brian Gesuale who reiterated his 'market perform’ rating on the stock. “We are taking our model above the guide given encouraging checks, the potential to benefit from Doge and recent momentum,” he added.
If Palantir exceeds its ambitious growth forecast for Q1 and raises guidance, the stock may pop counter to Gesuale’s advice.

Summary
AMD (AMD, Financial) is one of the most exciting chip companies in the world at the moment. Due to its strategic focus on AI, including a diversified approach centered on inference as well as training demand, the stock has a robust medium-term future ahead of it. Moreover, my valuation model posits a 35% margin of safety for investment assessed from a full financial breakdown of its earnings capacity and share count over the next three years. Additionally, my December 2027 price target of $290 is the conclusive reason I am highly bullish on AMD stock at its present valuation.
Operational & financial analysis
In my opinion, there are two semiconductor companies that are both the best-positioned in terms of valuation, financials, and operations to warrant heavy buying of their stock at the moment. However, there is a core difference between the two companies that makes AMD a more stable medium-term investment. I’ve mentioned extensively in previous analyses on Nvidia that it is likely to face a revenue decline in the medium term related to lower spend on AI infrastructure graphics processing units for model training. However, AMD is focusing on inference workloads, a potentially larger and more protracted market.
At the moment, AMD's data center segment accounts for about half of its total revenue and grew by 122% year-over-year in Q3 2024. However, Nvidia remains dominant with around a 90% share of the AI graphics processing unit market. Unlike training workloads that require high-end graphics processing units, inference can leverage central processing units, graphics processing units, and even specialized accelerators, providing AMD with multiple avenues to compete as it transitions its focus toward inference to differentiate itself from Nvidia.
In addition, while Nvidia has a comprehensive software ecosystem named CUDA, this is more focused on training utilizing high-performance graphics processing units like the H100. Inference workloads will be less reliant on CUDA, so AMD has an opportunity to compete with its open-source ROCm stack and cost-efficient solutions.
In the next two to three years, AMD is quite likely to achieve an earnings without non-recurring items compound annual growth rate of over 35% due to profit harvesting amid the upcycle of its AI ramp up and other diversified revenue streams. Moreover, this will likely coincide with around a 20% compound annual growth rate in its revenues over the time period. Such growth forecasts are based on my research and analysis of its current growth trends and market position and validated against consensus estimates from Wall Street. To be precise, I forecast $44.5 billion in annual revenue for Fiscal 2027 (ending December 2027), and earnings without non-recurring items of $8.37 for Fiscal 2027.
Valuation analysis
For my valuation model, I provide a full breakdown of the company's profit potential and share issuance. The model is capped at three years, in-line with my estimates above due to this likely being the highest-growth period to hold AMD stock in the foreseeable future.
The company's basic average shares outstanding have been increasing at an 8.23% compound annual growth rate over the past five years. If this trend slows due to profit harvesting meaning the company is less reliant on equity financing to fund its operations, a compound annual growth rate of 5% in its share count seems plausible over the next three years. The company's current trailing 12-month shares outstanding equals 1.62 billion, so I forecast it will have 1.88 billion trailing 12-month shares outstanding in December 2027.
AMD Shares Outstanding Chart
As I forecast that the company will have about a 35% trailing 12-month net margin without non-recurring items by December 2027, the company's net income without non-recurring items would be $15.75 billion. Given my forecast that it will have 1.88 billion shares outstanding, this equates to an earnings per share without non-recurring items of $8.37.
AMD stock is currently trading at a much cheaper price-to-earning ratio without non-recurring items compared to its 10-year median of just over 50. The current multiple is almost 40. Moreover, this indication of good value is not just due to cyclical profitability dynamics as the company's price-to-sales ratio of nearly 8 is only moderately higher than its 10-year median of 5.45, despite a three-year revenue growth rate of 19.9% compared to 2.5% as a 10-year median. I therefore consider AMD very reasonably valued right now. Indeed, a terminal multiple of 35 appears both consistent with historical valuations, industry norms (i.e. compared to Nvidia), and conservative given its robust growth horizon with no indication of a medium-term revenue decline for now.
AMD and Nvidia PS Ratio Chart
The result of my model is a fair December 2027 price target for AMD stock of $290, indicating approximately a three-year compound annual growth rate of over 35%.
AMD's weighted average cost of capital is 16.83%, composed of 98.6% equity (costing 17.02%) and 1.4% debt (costing 3.75% pre-tax, 3.75% post-tax due to a 0% effective tax rate). When discounting my December 2027 price target back to the present day over three years using the company's weighted average cost of capital as my discount rate, the implied intrinsic value is $180. As the stock is currently trading at $115, the implied margin of safety in my model is 35%.
Risk analysis
AMD is not the only company competing in the inference market and attempting to disrupt Nvidia's moat in AI infrastructure. Broadcom (AVGO, Financial) and Marvell (MRVL, Financial) are aggressively entering the AI accelerator market, with Broadcom showing particular promise with potentially $90 billion in AI-related revenue over the next three years. Moreover, there are niche players like Cerebras and Groq which are poised to dominate portions of use-case specific inference through targeting lower latency and higher throughput with tailored chips.
It is also worth considering that though we have Trump in the White House this year for a four year term, likely providing more geopolitical resilience through stronger leadership, tensions between the East and West are still high, especially surrounding Taiwan. If further hot wars break out or trade tensions escalate, supply chains and revenue streams could be disrupted. In a worst-case scenario of a market crash, I believe it prudent for investors to have a robust cash position at this time to mitigate risk and allow themselves to capitalize shrewdly on any major undervaluations that occur. This is the strategy being adopted by Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) (BRK.B), and it appears a shrewd model to emulate.
The greatest risk operationally and financially is that AMD has recently heavily concentrated its resources on AI. I do not consider this a bad thing, given that the AI industry is the highest-growth economic boom most people know of. However, it comes with risks for AMD shareholders if the company falls short of expectations. This could manifest if there is lumpiness in AI spending as enterprises optimize their budgets after initial build-outs, or if customers encounter any errors with its central processing units, graphics processing units, or AI accelerators, as two key examples.
Conclusion
I currently have a significant portion of my value trading portfolio in Nvidia shares, and I'm considering adding AMD shares at a higher or equal weight. I expect I will hold my AMD shares for longer than my Nvidia shares, because Nvidia is showing signs of significantly slower growth on the horizon and then, very likely, at least a minor revenue contraction. Therefore, I am only planning on holding Nvidia stock for about a year, but will likely hold my AMD position for two years or more. As my valuation model indicates, holding AMD stock for three years could result in a 35% compound annual growth rate, making it a top investment to consider at this time.
