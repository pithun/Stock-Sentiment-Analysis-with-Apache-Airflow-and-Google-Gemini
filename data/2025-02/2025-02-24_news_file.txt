    This month, mortgage rates saw a very mild recovery. Here's what to expect next.
  
If the headlines say mortgage rates are the lowest in months, that doesn't always mean the drop was significant. 
The recent decline in average 30-year fixed mortgage rates, from above 7% to around 6.9%, based on Bankrate data, won't shake up the housing market. Prospective homebuyers are still playing the waiting game. For the week ending Feb. 14, mortgage applications declined to the lowest level since the start of 2025, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. 
We're feeling the constraints of low housing affordability, said Jason Walter, a member of CNET Money's Expert Review Board with over a decade of experience as a real estate agent. ""US home prices are 3-5% higher than last year, and average 30-year fixed mortgage rates have been stuck near 7% for about two months,"" Walter said.
While experts predict rates to move lower throughout 2025, it's not going to be a dramatic decline. Fannie Mae expects average rates for 30-year fixed home loans to remain above 6.5% for most of the year.
Mortgage rates aside, prospective homebuyers are also contending with a long-standing housing shortage, high home prices and a loss of purchasing power due to inflation. Experts say many of the Trump administration's policies, such as tariffs, could cripple housing affordability even further, putting upward pressure on interest rates and the cost of building materials, like lumber, used to build new homes. 
For mortgage rates to fall substantially, especially in time for the spring homebuying season, there need to be signs of cooler inflation. This would open the door to more rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, but that doesn't look likely right now. 
Recent data shows inflation rising by 3% on an annual basis, moving away from the central bank's 2% target. If the Fed does decide to cut interest rates again, it's unlikely to happen before the summer or fall.
Uncertainty surrounding new fiscal policies is also contributing to buyer hesitancy. The prospect of trade wars, mass deportations and a ballooning federal tax deficit could spark volatility in the bond market. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate (the most popular home loan term) is benchmarked to the 10-year Treasury note. Higher bond yields translate to higher borrowing costs on home loans.
""The good news for homebuyers, though, is that housing inventory is rising, and more homeowners are opting to list their homes for sale,"" said Walter. 
Aside from day-to-day fluctuations, mortgage rates are expected to stay between 6.5% and 7% for a while. Those rates seem high compared with the 2% rates of the pandemic era, but experts say rock-bottom rates are unlikely without a severe economic downturn. Since the 1970s, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has been around 7%.
Here are some of the factors affecting mortgage rates today:
Trump's economic policies: President Donald Trump's potential tax cuts and tariffs are still a wild card for mortgage rates. Experts say such moves could stimulate demand, increase deficits and accelerate inflation. Mortgage rates are highly sensitive to fiscal policy and economic growth. 
Fed rate cuts: While the central bank doesn't directly set home loan rates, mortgage rates are indirectly influenced by the Fed's policy decisions. If incoming data shows higher inflation and a strong labor market, the Fed will delay future rate reductions this year, which in turn would keep home loan rates high. 
10-year Treasury yields: Average 30-year fixed mortgage rates closely track bond yields, specifically 10-year Treasury yields. If inflation and labor data continue to be strong, bond yields and mortgage rates will go up. The opposite will happen if unemployment rises or inflation cools and the Fed resumes cutting rates. 
Investor expectations: Bond investors act in anticipation of what they believe will happen in the economy. The Fed's outlook for future monetary policy determines investor trading strategy and risk assessment, which is why mortgage rates often jump or dip before interest rates are adjusted. 
Geopolitical situations: Mortgage rates are affected by geopolitical events, including military conflicts and elections. Political instability can lead to economic uncertainty, which can result in more volatility with bond yields and mortgage rates.
It's never a good idea to rush into buying a home without knowing what you can afford, so establish a clear home-buying budget. Here's what experts recommend before purchasing a home: 
💰 Build your credit score. Your credit score will help determine whether you qualify for a mortgage and at what interest rate. A credit score of 740 or higher will help you qualify for a lower rate.
💰 Save for a bigger down payment. A larger down payment allows you to take out a smaller mortgage and get a lower interest rate from your lender. If you can afford it, a down payment of at least 20% will also eliminate private mortgage insurance.
💰 Shop for mortgage lenders. Comparing loan offers from multiple mortgage lenders can help you negotiate a better rate. Experts recommend getting at least two to three loan estimates from different lenders.
💰 Consider renting. Choosing to rent or buy a home isn't just comparing monthly rent to a mortgage payment. Renting offers flexibility and lower upfront costs, but buying allows you to build wealth and have more control over your housing costs.
💰 Consider mortgage points. You can get a lower mortgage rate by buying mortgage points, with each point costing 1% of the total loan amount. One mortgage point equals a 0.25% decrease in your mortgage rate."

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with a former Meta employee who worked at the company for 2  years. They spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns about future employment. Business Insider has verified their identity, employment, and performance reviews at Meta. The following has been edited for length and clarity.

        I was hired by Meta in late 2022. During my time there, I received performance evaluations every six months, in which my ratings were always ""at or above expectation"" or ""consistently met expectation."" Of course, I received small tweaks and feedback that are normal in any review, but I never received any signal that I was a low performer or that I was trending downwards.
    

        When Zuckerberg announced Meta would be laying off the lowest 5% of performers, I felt a general sense of anxiety, but I looked at the criteria they were going to apply and thought: ""This doesn't apply to me. I've gotten really good ratings up to this point."" I didn't consider I'd be in that bucket.
    

        They sent an email at 5 a.m. PST, and by 8 a.m. we'd been locked out of our chats. I didn't get to say goodbye to my colleagues. The morning of my layoff, I felt despondent. I'd worked really, really hard to get this job, had worked long hours, and had put a lot of effort into supporting my team. I just felt this deep sense of defeat.
    

        And then I got angry. I was livid, like transcendentally livid. I can't even really put into words how it felt. I'd lost so much — my confidence, my reputation, a substantial amount of unvested stock. I just remember being in bed, screaming into a pillow.
    

        I felt betrayed by the company I'd worked for, and they destroyed my confidence in the process.
    

        I haven't received any documentation explaining how they got my ""low performer"" rating, so I don't have any official idea of why this occurred. I didn't get a signal from my manager. I just received the rating and the termination letter stating I was being let go.
    

        I'm so scared about how this ""low performer"" label will affect my ability to find a new job.
    

        Right now, the zeitgeist is sympathetic to those of us who've been laid off, but I know it's going to impact future employment. It's already a tough job market, so I'm scared. I'm really, really scared.
    

        Because Meta clearly labeled people affected as low performers, any hiring manager who looks at my end date will know. We are uniquely disadvantaged because this announcement was leaked and widely publicized.
    

        For the first week after my layoff, I couldn't even fathom the idea of updating my rsum or looking for jobs. I felt so hopeless that I could hardly even motivate myself to get out of bed. I already struggled with imposter syndrome, and this felt like Meta threw salt in the wound. I'm going to have to rebuild my self-confidence, and that's going to take time.
    

        I think this is going to be a moment to take a step back, recenter myself, and think about what I truly want for myself and my career. Right now, I know I value some sense of stability. I know no job is stable, but I really want my next role to be somewhere where I feel like leadership at least doesn't seem to have an openly hostile position toward its employees.
    

        I used to defend Mark Zuckerberg to people. I thought he was personable in company meetings and really funny. Now, I feel like that was just a facade.
    

        Between the layoff, removing DEI initiatives, and changes around content moderation, Mark Zuckerberg seems to be testing how many decisions he can make without retribution. Because Meta is such a big player in the tech industry, I'm concerned the company is creating an environment where other employers will follow suit.
    

        Tech used to be a place where companies took care of their employees and where we were supported, but now it feels like we're all in a meat grinder. It's really sad to see.
    

Meta laid off thousands of employees and said they were going to start filling many of those roles with new people.
    

        I joined at a time when Meta's stock was lower, and like many of my coworkers, a portion of my compensation is tied to the value of the company's stock. I have questioned whether the low-performance label was a way to let expensive employees go.
    

        I'm worried about speaking out for fear of retribution. I hope people are empathetic toward those impacted by layoffs six months or a year down the road.
    

        Nobody knows how long we'll be looking for a new job. I've heard horror stories of people applying to hundreds of jobs for over a year. I don't think that's going to be my position, but it indicates how hard the market is right now.
    

        I had a call with my dad the other day and told him I just don't know what to hope for right now. The rug was pulled out from under me. I don't know how to move forward from that.
    

Meta did not respond to a request for comment by Business Insider.

3,2025-02-24,"Starbucks is cutting 1,100 jobs and simplifying its menu in the US as it tries to improve flagging business in its home market. 
The first items to get the axe include the Royal English Breakfast Latte, White Hot Chocolate and several kinds of blended frappuccinos. 
But Starbucks said more offerings would be cut, as it aims to shrink its menu by nearly a third over the next year, hoping to reduce wait times and improve quality and consistency. 
The company has been wrestling with a sustained fall in sales since last year, which has been particularly pronounced in the US.
Chief executive Brian Niccol, who previously headed the Mexican food chain Chipotle, was brought into Starbucks last year to help turn the business around.
He has said he wants to see the company return to its roots as a coffee house. 
The drinks set for the chopping block ""weren't commonly purchased, can be complex to make, or are like other beverages on our menu"", Starbucks said. The changes are due to go into effect on 4 March. 
""We're simplifying our menu to focus on fewer, more popular items, executed with excellence,"" the company said on Monday.
""This will make way for innovation, help reduce wait times, improve quality and consistency, and align with our core identity as a coffee company.""
The job cuts announced on Monday are focused on corporate ""support partner"" roles and will not affect jobs or investments at stores, the company said. 
The company said it would inform staff affected by the decisions by mid-day on Tuesday. It is also eliminating ""several hundred"" open and unfilled positions. 
""Our intent is to operate more efficiently, increase accountability, reduce complexity and drive better integration,"" Mr Niccol wrote in the announcement. 
Starbucks employs more than 360,000 people and operates or licenses more than 40,000 stores around the world. 
The US is its biggest and most important market, but its brand there has suffered in recent years as customers complained about long wait times and high prices, and the company wrestled with baristas trying to unionise. 
The company was also embroiled in debates over the Israel-Gaza war, facing boycott calls from both pro-Israel and pro-Palestine camps, despite the company's efforts to remain neutral. 
The company last month said transactions at US stores open at least a year were down 8% in the most recent quarter, compared with the same period a year earlier.
The drive to simplify the menu marks a shift from previous strategies, which emphasised personalised drinks.

Hot stock Alibaba has set its sights beyond AI to focus on artificial general intelligence, or AGI.

        ""We aim to continue to develop models that extend the boundaries of intelligence,"" said Eddie Wu, Alibaba's CEO, on Thursday. He called the pursuit of AGI the company's ""first and foremost goal.""
    

        AGI is AI technology that mimics human intelligence to the point that it can achieve complex cognitive tasks involving logic and reasoning.
    

        US-based companies working toward AGI include OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Microsoft. Masayoshi Son, the CEO of major AI investor SoftBank, said earlier this month that he expects AGI to arrive ""much earlier"" than his late-2024 forecast of two to three years.
    

        Wu's statement came after Alibaba released blockbuster results on Thursday. For the quarter ending in December, Alibaba posted an 8% rise in revenue to 280.2 billion yuan, or $38.6 billion. Profit rose to 48.9 billion yuan, beating analysts' expectations.
    

        ""The pursuit of AGI can contribute immense business value,"" said Wu, citing studies indicating that AGI — when achieved — could replace or achieve 80% of human capabilities. He said about 50% of global GDP comes from wages for blue- and white-collar work.
    

        ""If AGI can be achieved, then that could have a tremendous impact in terms of the restructuring industry around the world. It could have a significant influence on or even replace 50% of global GDP,"" he said.
    

        On Monday, Alibaba announced that it's planning to invest at least 380 billion Chinese yuan, or $53 billion, in cloud computing and AI infrastructure over the next three years.
    

        The company is in a crowded global race for AI supremacy as US tech giants ramp up their AI spending. According to recent earnings reports, the combined capital expenditures of Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta are set to exceed $320 billion in 2025.
    

        Amazon is leading the charge, with over $100 billion earmarked for capital expenditures this year. The vast majority will go toward expanding Amazon Web Services and scaling AI infrastructure, the company said.
    

        However, the dramatic rise of DeepSeek, which released a new cost-competitive AI model last month, has thrown Chinese tech companies into the spotlight and caused investors to question whether massive Big Tech AI investments are justified.
    

        US-listed Alibaba shares are up 70% this year to date, thanks to the boost from DeepSeek and after Alibaba announced that it was working with Apple to incorporate its AI into iPhones in China.
    

        The upswing marks a major turnaround after Beijing's yearslong Big Tech regulatory crackdown, when cofounder Jack Ma's tech empire came under intense scrutiny.
    

        Last week, Chinese leader Xi Jinping met with the country's top tech leaders — including Ma — in a sign that the country's private sector is now back in favor again.
    

        The market is viewing the meeting as a possible end of the crackdown. The Chinese government is seemingly working to revive an economy disrupted by a pandemic, regulatory crackdowns, and a real estate crisis, wrote Deutsche Bank analysts in a note last week following the event.
    

        On Monday, Hong Kong-listed Alibaba shares were 2.5% lower by midday after recent gains and as Asian stocks were broadly pressured by sharp losses in the US markets on Friday.

What did you do last week? Sorry to be so blunt, but federal workers are grappling with that question. DOGE sent an email this weekend asking government employees to list their recent accomplishments before midnight tonight. Many told BI they feel frustrated by the request. The Department of Defense, meanwhile, instructed staff not to respond.

        In today's big story, getting an advanced degree was once viewed as the best path toward job security. Now, it's proving to be a liability on your rsum.
    

What's on deck


Markets: The takeaways from Warren Buffett's annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders.
    

Tech: A former big-time Elon Musk believer makes the case for why Tesla is in trouble this year.
    

Business: The Russian media oligarch pushing Putin to even further extremes.
    

        But first, school's out forever.
    

If this was forwarded to you, sign up here.


Their degrees were something for them to fall back on. Instead, they're in a free fall.


        Job seekers with advanced degrees are having a much harder time finding work compared to their less-educated peers, writes Business Insider's Aki Ito.
    

        These days, you're better off with just a high school diploma instead of a Ph.D. if you want to find work fast. People who didn't go to college can get work twice as quickly as those with advanced degrees.
    

        (Let's be clear: Advanced-degree holders still largely rule the roost on compensation. But pay only matters once you have a job.)
    

        Aki has previously written about the struggles of white-collar workers thanks to hiring reductions among tech and finance firms. Those are common landing spots for people with advanced degrees, which might be why extra education isn't paying off in the job hunt.
    

        However, Aki's story explores whether the labor market's latest shift could signal a bigger change in the importance of education.
    

        All of this is also happening at a time when colleges are facing a reckoning.
    

        Some say you can't put a price on education, but universities have certainly tried. With the cost of a four-year degree at a private college easily surpassing $250,000, more and more young people are questioning the benefits of college, let alone grad school.
    

Another corner of the job market that was once a sure thing is also getting shaken up.


        Government jobs, traditionally considered a stable paycheck with good benefits, have been upended by the Trump administration. (Just reread the intro to this newsletter if you need a recent example.)
    

        Tens of thousands of employees took buyouts, and thousands of probationary workers were fired during the first month of the Department of Government Efficiency's cost-cutting efforts.It's still unclear the impact these job cuts will have on the wider labor market. But continuing to make wholesale changes to the largest employer in the US, which is known for its job security, will likely have some residual effect.
    

1. Warren Buffett's tax bill was a doozy. Berkshire Hathaway, the legendary investor's conglomerate, paid a record $26.8 billion in taxes last year, Buffett wrote in his annual letter to shareholders. It's the most paid by any US company in history and represents about 5% of total American corporate income taxes paid in 2024. ""Spend it wisely,"" Buffett wrote. The letter also included some more fundamental business — and life — lessons, too.
    

2. The meme coin explosion. Once an obscure corner of crypto, meme coins have taken on a life — and market — of their own. But scams are common with meme coins, and ongoing conversations about a regulatory path are another big question mark.
    

3. How a hedge fund repays $1.2 billion to investors heading for the exits. The past few years have been rocky for Paloma Partners, posting just a 2.5% return in 2024. The multistrategy hedge fund said last fall it would take time to repay departing investors. To meet redemption requests, Paloma plans to pull $600 million from hedge funds it backed, including the quant firm Aquatic Capital, according to four people familiar with the matter.
    

1. An early Tesla investor is now bearish on the stock. Ross Gerber was among the first to spot Tesla's potential, but he isn't feeling so confident now. Gerber doubts the company can achieve Full Self-Driving on time without switching hardware, and he believes Elon Musk has too many pots in the fire.
    

2. We're hiring  just not humans. Originally created as an experiment, two founders built a jobs board for AI agents. The jobs board, dubbed ""Job for Agent,"" provides insight into what companies might look for in an AI workforce.
    

3. AI bosses feel the pressure. In a recent interview, the CEOs of Google DeepMind and Anthropic spoke about the weight of responsibility that comes with ushering in AI. The leaders urged people to better grasp the real force for change they expect AI to be — and for societies to start planning accordingly.
    

1. The oligarch who wants to ""Make Russia Great Again."" There is one Russian nationalist currently in the spotlight who may be even more zealous than Vladimir Putin. Konstantin Malofeyev operates Tsargrad, a multimedia platform with over three million followers. He embraces Trumpian rhetoric and helped organize the Russian separatist rebellion in Ukraine's Donbas region, paving the way for Putin's invasion. But Malofeyev thinks Putin isn't doing enough to crush Ukraine.
    

2. Scaredy-cat capitalism in the new Trump era. While deregulation and tax cuts are generally favored by corporate America, Trump and his policies aren't exactly predictable. That's leading some companies — from Meta to Disney — to brace for his whims. Many businesses are trying to get in Trump's good graces by cutting back on DEI and handing over a check.
    

3. You might be waiting on your tax return this year. The Internal Revenue Service began firing probationary workers last week who were not ""critical"" to tax filing season. These terminations are part of Trump's efforts to slash the federal workforce, but it could result in more backlogs, slower customer service, and delayed refunds, tax experts and IRS employees told BI. An IRS HR employee said the firings, coupled with a hiring freeze, could set the agency behind on its functions well into 2026.

9,2025-02-24,"Today, we’re announcing Claude 3.7 Sonnet1, our most intelligent model to date and the first hybrid reasoning model on the market. Claude 3.7 Sonnet can produce near-instant responses or extended, step-by-step thinking that is made visible to the user. API users also have fine-grained control over how long the model can think for.
Claude 3.7 Sonnet shows particularly strong improvements in coding and front-end web development. Along with the model, we’re also introducing a command line tool for agentic coding, Claude Code. Claude Code is available as a limited research preview, and enables developers to delegate substantial engineering tasks to Claude directly from their terminal.
Claude 3.7 Sonnet is now available on all Claude plans—including Free, Pro, Team, and Enterprise—as well as the Anthropic API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud’s Vertex AI. Extended thinking mode is available on all surfaces except the free Claude tier.
In both standard and extended thinking modes, Claude 3.7 Sonnet has the same price as its predecessors: $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens—which includes thinking tokens.
We’ve developed Claude 3.7 Sonnet with a different philosophy from other reasoning models on the market. Just as humans use a single brain for both quick responses and deep reflection, we believe reasoning should be an integrated capability of frontier models rather than a separate model entirely. This unified approach also creates a more seamless experience for users.
Claude 3.7 Sonnet embodies this philosophy in several ways. First, Claude 3.7 Sonnet is both an ordinary LLM and a reasoning model in one: you can pick when you want the model to answer normally and when you want it to think longer before answering. In the standard mode, Claude 3.7 Sonnet represents an upgraded version of Claude 3.5 Sonnet. In extended thinking mode, it self-reflects before answering, which improves its performance on math, physics, instruction-following, coding, and many other tasks. We generally find that prompting for the model works similarly in both modes.
Second, when using Claude 3.7 Sonnet through the API, users can also control the budget for thinking: you can tell Claude to think for no more than N tokens, for any value of N up to its output limit of 128K tokens. This allows you to trade off speed (and cost) for quality of answer.
Third, in developing our reasoning models, we’ve optimized somewhat less for math and computer science competition problems, and instead shifted focus towards real-world tasks that better reflect how businesses actually use LLMs.
Early testing demonstrated Claude’s leadership in coding capabilities across the board: Cursor noted Claude is once again best-in-class for real-world coding tasks, with significant improvements in areas ranging from handling complex codebases to advanced tool use. Cognition found it far better than any other model at planning code changes and handling full-stack updates. Vercel highlighted Claude’s exceptional precision for complex agent workflows, while Replit has successfully deployed Claude to build sophisticated web apps and dashboards from scratch, where other models stall. In Canva’s evaluations, Claude consistently produced production-ready code with superior design taste and drastically reduced errors.
Since June 2024, Sonnet has been the preferred model for developers worldwide. Today, we're empowering developers further by introducing Claude Code—our first agentic coding tool—in a limited research preview.
Claude Code is an active collaborator that can search and read code, edit files, write and run tests, commit and push code to GitHub, and use command line tools—keeping you in the loop at every step.
Claude Code is an early product but has already become indispensable for our team, especially for test-driven development, debugging complex issues, and large-scale refactoring. In early testing, Claude Code completed tasks in a single pass that would normally take 45+ minutes of manual work, reducing development time and overhead.
In the coming weeks, we plan to continually improve it based on our usage: enhancing tool call reliability, adding support for long-running commands, improved in-app rendering, and expanding Claude's own understanding of its capabilities.
Our goal with Claude Code is to better understand how developers use Claude for coding to inform future model improvements. By joining this preview, you’ll get access to the same powerful tools we use to build and improve Claude, and your feedback will directly shape its future.
We’ve also improved the coding experience on Claude.ai. Our GitHub integration is now available on all Claude plans—enabling developers to connect their code repositories directly to Claude.
Claude 3.7 Sonnet is our best coding model to date. With a deeper understanding of your personal, work, and open source projects, it becomes a more powerful partner for fixing bugs, developing features, and building documentation across your most important GitHub projects.
We’ve conducted extensive testing and evaluation of Claude 3.7 Sonnet, working with external experts to ensure it meets our standards for security, safety, and reliability. Claude 3.7 Sonnet also makes more nuanced distinctions between harmful and benign requests, reducing unnecessary refusals by 45% compared to its predecessor.
The system card for this release covers new safety results in several categories, providing a detailed breakdown of our Responsible Scaling Policy evaluations that other AI labs and researchers can apply to their work. The card also addresses emerging risks that come with computer use, particularly prompt injection attacks, and explains how we evaluate these vulnerabilities and train Claude to resist and mitigate them. Additionally, it examines potential safety benefits from reasoning models: the ability to understand how models make decisions, and whether model reasoning is genuinely trustworthy and reliable. Read the full system card to learn more.
Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Claude Code mark an important step towards AI systems that can truly augment human capabilities. With their ability to reason deeply, work autonomously, and collaborate effectively, they bring us closer to a future where AI enriches and expands what humans can achieve.
We're excited for you to explore these new capabilities and to see what you’ll create with them. As always, we welcome your feedback as we continue to improve and evolve our models.
1 Lesson learned on naming.
Information about the scaffolding
Scores were achieved with a prompt addendum to the Airline Agent Policy instructing Claude to better utilize a “planning” tool, where the model is encouraged to write down its thoughts as it solves the problem distinct from our usual thinking mode, during the multi-turn trajectories to best leverage its reasoning abilities. To accommodate the additional steps Claude incurs by utilizing more thinking, the maximum number of steps (counted by model completions) was increased from 30 to 100 (most trajectories completed under 30 steps with only one trajectory reaching above 50 steps).
Additionally, the TAU-bench score for Claude 3.5 Sonnet (new) differs from what we originally reported on release because of small dataset improvements introduced since then. We re-ran on the updated dataset for more accurate comparison with Claude 3.7 Sonnet.
Information about the scaffolding
There are many approaches to solving open ended agentic tasks like SWE-bench. Some approaches offload much of the complexity of deciding which files to investigate or edit and which tests to run to more traditional software, leaving the core language model to generate code in predefined places, or select from a more limited set of actions. Agentless (Xia et al., 2024) is a popular framework used in the evaluation of Deepseek’s R1 and other models which augments an agent with prompt- and embedding-based file retrieval mechanisms, patch localization, and best-of-40 rejection sampling against regression tests. Other scaffolds (e.g. Aide) further supplement models with additional test-time compute in the form of retries, best-of-N, or Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).
For Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Claude 3.5 Sonnet (new), we use a much simpler approach with minimal scaffolding, where the model decides which commands to run and files to edit in a single session. Our main “no extended thinking” pass@1 result simply equips the model with the two tools described here—a bash tool, and a file editing tool that operates via string replacements—as well as the “planning tool” mentioned above in our TAU-bench results. Due to infrastructure limitations, only 489/500 problems are actually solvable on our internal infrastructure (i.e., the golden solution passes the tests). For our vanilla pass@1 score we are counting the 11 unsolvable problems as failures to maintain parity with the official leaderboard. For transparency, we separately release the test cases that did not work on our infrastructure.
For our “high compute” number we adopt additional complexity and parallel test-time compute as follows:
This results in a score of 70.3% on the subset of n=489 verified tasks which work on our infrastructure. Without this scaffold, Claude 3.7 Sonnet achieves 63.7% on SWE-bench Verified using this same subset. The excluded 11 test cases that were incompatible with our internal infrastructure are:"

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Christian Lovell, a 31-year-old career coach from Los Angeles. It has been edited for length and clarity.

        I'm the founder of Careers by Chris, a growing online community of job seekers, and a former career expert at Sofi. I help people figure out the next steps in their careers and how to land their next job.
    

On my Instagram, I share actionable, understandable, and easily digestible career growth tips that people may not have learned in school. I answer common questions like: How do I build an effective rsum? What's an applicant tracking system? How do I market myself for a role that I want?
    

        In the current job market and economy, one question to consider is: How do I know if my boss wants me to quit? This job market is the toughest I've ever seen, and you must be prepared for anything.
    

        Although just one sign alonemight not be an indicator, here are six signs your boss might want you to quit and what to do next.
    

        A lack of communication is one sign that your boss might be pushing you to quit. If they're decreasing your one-on-ones, making it hard to communicate with them, or if you're unable to get the support you need, it could indicate that developing you as an employee is no longer a priority.
    

        On their end, it wouldn't make sense to pour resources into further developing you if they don't plan to keep you around.
    

        Similarly, discussions about your future might stop if they don't see you having a future at the company. They might no longer say things during your performance reviews, like, ""In three months or six months, this will be happening,"" or they may stop mentioning your promotion altogether.
    

        If you say to your manager, ""Hey, I want to talk about my next steps,"" and they're not open to having those conversations, that's a red flag.
    

        This might mean they're making excuses or perpetually putting things off. They may feel guilty about letting you go, they might not yet have all the information themselves, or they might not be at liberty to talk about it.
    

        Another sign your boss might be pushing you to quit is if they start excluding you from important meetings or other key forms of communication, such as emails, team meetings, or Slack channels.
    

        If you've been part of a project update every month or week, and suddenly you're no longer included, that can be a sign.There could be many excuses for why you're being excluded from important projects or meetings, like ""it was an oversight"" or ""we're changing how we're structuring this project.""
    

        It could also indicate that your work is being reassigned or that they're removing you from projects because they no longer see you as part of the company's future. Again, understanding these decisions in context is important. How often is this happening? How relevant are the projects you're excluded from to your core job duties?
    

        If you realize you're not on any important projects and feel like you're doing busy work, that can also be an indicator.
    

        This could look like being asked to do tasks below your normal job duties, like summarizing meeting notes, instead of the important projects you were once on.
    

        You might also be given an unbearable amount of work. Your boss could set unrealistic expectations and then document them, saying, ""I asked my employee to do X, Y, and Z, and they failed to do it. So now there is a reason to let them go,"" or you might say, ""This is unbearable, and I need to quit.""
    

        I've seen this happen to a lot of people. Once it happens, I tell them they should be searching if they have inklings they're being pushed out of their job. Do not wait until you can't bear it, or they let you go.
    

        When it comes to finding new work, you won't list your reason for leaving a job on a rsum, so your next company would not know if you quit or were fired, but there will be times when you have to explain your departure from the company, like in future interviews.
    

        There are pros and cons to quitting or waiting to be let go, and the best choice will depend on where you are in your career.
    

PIPs (performance improvement plans) do not 100% mean you'll be fired from your job, but they are a sign. PIPs are used to create a paper trail — and, in many cases, let the employee go.
    

        If you're put on a PIP, you should make arrangements to find another job. PIPs can be a sign they're preparing to have a final conversation with you and let you go. PIPs are usually paired with micromanaging and unrealistic or unreasonable workloads.
    

        Regardless of whether you're on a PIP, never fully remove yourself from the market. Keep your rsum updated and your network warm.
    

        Seeing one of these signs doesn't necessarily mean your boss wants to let you go. Instead of jumping to conclusions, ask yourself: Are there multiple signs? Could it just be your imposter syndrome? And most importantly, have things with your boss shifted from one extreme to the other?
    

        If you do feel your boss wants you to quit, you should first have a conversation with them. Document your achievements, and if you feel your time at the company is ending one way or the other, start your job search.

12,2025-02-24,"Apple co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, so today would have marked his 70th birthday if he hadn't passed away in 2011 at the age of 56.
In 1976, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak co-founded Apple Computer Company to market Wozniak's Apple I, a pioneering personal computer. Their collaboration led to the introduction of the Apple II in 1977, which significantly influenced the personal computing industry. 
In 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh, notable for its graphical user interface and the iconic ""1984"" Super Bowl commercial directed by Ridley Scott. However, internal conflicts led to Jobs' departure from Apple in 1985. He then founded NeXT Inc., focusing on advanced computer platforms. 
In 1997, Apple acquired NeXT, bringing Jobs back to the company as interim CEO. Under his leadership, Apple revitalized its product line and introduced groundbreaking products like the iMac, iPod, and iPhone. Apple Computer Company was renamed Apple Inc. in 2007 as the company expanded its focus from computers to consumer electronics. 
Jobs remained at the helm until his death in 2011, during which time Apple transformed into one of the world's leading technology companies.
As expected, Apple CEO Tim Cook has shared his thoughts about Steve on X (Twitter):

Steve saw the world not just as it was, but as it could be. His vision continues to inspire us to push boundaries and create the future. Today, on his 70th birthday, we honor his legacy and his enduring impact. pic.twitter.com/0q1JUl4UJw

13,2025-02-24,"Tipster took to X to post full renders of the 'Rio Red' device.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Leaks of the upcoming Motorola Razr Plus 2025 keep coming in, one more revealing than the next. This time, we got to see the device in a whole new colorway, thanks to tipster Evan Blass.
Taking to X, Blass posted multiple images of the alleged Motorola Razr Plus 2025, also called the Motorola Razr 60 Ultra. We get to see the phone in a new hue, dubbed 'Rio Red.' These images didn't just show off the red colorway but also gave us images from multiple angles of what we could expect from the hardware aspect of the device.
From its looks, the new red Razr will also get a faux leather back, similar to the dark green colorway that leaked earlier this month. There also appears to be a new button on one side, which could be similar to the Quick Button found on the Motorola Edge 2024.

So far, from all the leaks collectively we see that this year's edition will look a lot like last year's phone, however in a more polished look with the leather back. But when it comes to specific design changes, previous leaks have hinted that the right edge houses the volume buttons and a side-mounted fingerprint scanner similar to the above images. At the bottom, we see a SIM slot, mic, USB-C port, and speaker next to each other.
On the display front, the device will supposedly stick with its 6.9-inch pOLED foldable display and a 4-inch OLED cover screen like the Razr Plus 2024. And like any new or upcoming phone on the market, the Moto Razr Plus 2025 could be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, with the seven-core version specifically made for foldables.
On the camera front, the images indicate that it'll have a dual camera array. While we don't know much about the exact specs of the lens, we assume it could be a combination of a wide-angle lens and a telephoto lens, like its predecessor.
Other than that, the clamshell is rumored to get a 4,000mAh battery that will maintain support for 45W wired and 15W wireless charging speeds like its predecessor, which remains one of the best foldable phones on the market.

MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russian President Vladimir Putin offered the U.S. the opportunity for joint exploration of the country's rare earth metals deposits, as well as the supply of aluminum to the U.S. domestic market, under a future economic deal.
U.S. President Donald Trump earlier said that ""major economic development transactions with Russia"" would take place. Within two hours of Trump's statement, Putin chaired a meeting with his ministers and economic advisers on rare earth metals.
""We, by the way, would be ready to offer (joint projects with) our American partners, and when I say 'partners,' I mean not only administrative and governmental structures but also companies, if they showed interest in joint work,"" Putin said on state TV after the meeting.
""We undoubtedly have, I want to emphasize, significantly more resources of this kind than Ukraine,"" Putin added. He mentioned that a potential U.S.-Ukraine deal involving rare earth metals was not a concern for Russia.
Russia has the world's fifth-largest reserves of rare earth metals, according to the U.S. Geological Survey data, after China, Brazil, India and Australia. Russia reserves are estimated at 3.8 million metric tons.
The rare earth metals are used to make magnets that turn power into motion for electric vehicles, cell phones, missile systems, and other electronics. Russia mines only 2,500 tons of concentrate a year and lacks capacity for processing.
Putin said that potential rare earth metals exploration deals could also be extended to deposits in territory in eastern Ukraine that Russia controls after three years of military action.
Putin noted that Russian companies could also supply up to 2 million tons of aluminum to the U.S. market annually if the U.S. market reopens. Russia used to provide up to 15% of U.S. aluminum imports before prohibitive duties were introduced in 2023.
""This (Russian aluminium supplies) will not significantly affect price formation. However, in my opinion, it would still have a restraining influence on prices,"" Putin said.
Putin suggested that Russia and the U.S. could work jointly on hydropower generation and aluminum production in Russia's Krasnoyarsk region in Siberia, which is the home base for Russia's largest aluminum maker, Rusal.
""What is most important, in my opinion, is that we could consider working together with American companies in this area,"" Putin said. He estimated potential investment in this project at $15 billion.
Putin said that joint projects could be extended to the energy sector as well, and that some Russian and U.S. companies were already in touch. He did not give details.
In a transcript posted by the Kremlin, Putin said rare earths were a priority sector for Russia's economic development and competitiveness.
The government sought to ""boost the potential of the domestic industry"" extending from extraction to ""manufacture of ready-made high-technology goods,"" he said.
""Based on the results of the national project, the volume of output of such goods should increase several times over,"" he said.

﻿A new survey from The Verge and Vox Media addresses this moment of internet fragmentation.

Illustrations by Samar Haddad
The modern internet is nearly three decades old, and it’s starting to show its age. Think back to the ’90s: some of what we built back then, though groundbreaking, now feels outdated. The Verge recently created a special issue on what we were doing online in 2004, highlighting how Web 2.0 was born. Take a step back and think about how we interact, transact, and spend our time online. Are we clinging to old structures that no longer serve us? Is it time to remodel our digital lives and rethink how we’re building our online experiences to better reflect the way we live today? 
In this emerging AI era, the very ideas of community and human connection are poised for redefinition. Brands and platforms will weaponize the terms in a bid to capture the attention of their ideal audiences.
But where are communities really headed? How should this evolution shape how creators and media companies build products and marketers engage with their audiences? These are the questions that will define the next phase of the internet.
The Verge partnered with Vox Media’s Insights and Research team, along with Two Cents Insights, to better understand how American consumers are embracing this shift. The goal of the work was to redefine what online communities will be in a post-social media era of emerging AI and Google Zero. And as brands look to hold onto the internet of the past, the term “community” will become a loaded word, with brands and platforms trying to use it more often to reach their ideal consumer.
Our research makes one thing clear: power is shifting back to the consumer (the fediverse signals this). Consumers crave community, but on their own terms — seeking deeper, more meaningful connections with those who truly matter (something we identified in 2014). Authenticity is at the heart of it all, supported by a foundation of safety and security. The future of community is personal, intentional, and built on trust.
The research covers the following chapters:
Here are some key takeaways from the survey:

17,2025-02-24,"Nike (NKE-1.37%) stock jumped more than 5% after Jefferies (JEF-1.31%) gave the company a rave review, saying that CEO Elliott Hill is tackling production and distribution head-on and that it expects a “V-shaped” rebound in profit margin and earnings per share in the 2027 financial year.
Analysts, led by Randal Konik, made the stock a top pick, raising their recommendation to “buy” from hold and boosting their price target to $115 from $75. They estimate EPS of $3.50 — compared with consensus for $2.95 — in the fiscal year through May 2027, up from a projected $2.08 in the year through May 2025.
Nike had a really rough 2024: sales fell around the world, shares dropped 60% from a 2021 high point, and the company’s relationship with major retailers was damaged.
“Nike’s brand remains very strong, proving that issues were self-inflicted and competitive threats less severe,” the analysts wrote. While the company has lost market share due to strategic missteps, including reduce product innovation, it should be able to stabilize its share of the athletic footwear market at the low- to mid-20% range, they said.
Hill has “prioritized restoring wholesale partnerships and driving innovation,” a playbook that worked a decade ago. This should accelerate unit volumes and allow the company to sell more shoes at full price.
As part of its rebound push, Nike this month said it’s working with Kim Kardashian on NikeSkims, a shoe and athletic wear range aimed at women. The company recorded more than $8.5 billion in revenue generated from female apparel in its fiscal year 2024, less than half the $20.8 billion it made off of male apparel.
It marks the first time that Nike has ever joined with an existing, outside firm to launch a brand.

Trusted coffee equipment reviewer and professional coffee roaster uses the Hive to teach home roasting. Sprometheus also reviewed an early model of the Cascabel Hive Roaster!
I have been a professional coffee roaster for over 20 years. Initially the Hive appealed to me because of it’s simplicity. I ordered it thinking it was a novelty that I’d use occasionally, I was wrong. This is a serious tool that can be used by an amateur or professional alike with great results.

I wanted to brew it more like people did in other countries, NOT with a freakin' popcorn popper! The Cascabel gave me that tool. It's more akin to a drum roaster than you'd think, as in, it has hot metal AND hot air. It's a handheld, swirlin', swishin', swayin' coffee oven!

Starbucks is laying off 1,100 corporate employees this week and will halt hiring for hundreds of open roles.

        ""We are simplifying our structure, removing layers and duplication and creating smaller, more nimble teams,"" Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol said in a letter announcing the layoffs on Monday. ""Our intent is to operate more efficiently, increase accountability, reduce complexity and drive better integration.""
    

        Employees at Starbucks' stores will not be affected by the layoffs, Starbucks said.
    

        Starbucks currently has 16,000 employees across its corporate offices as well as other areas of the business, such as roasting operations. Not all of those employees are on teams affected by the layoffs, Starbucks said.
    

        The company has been seeking to rejuvenate sliding sales in the US, its main market. Niccol, who was named CEO in September last year, has said the company needs to prioritize the customer experience, including focusing more on baristas, which the company calls ""partners.""
    

        ""I recognize the news is difficult,"" he said in the memo. ""We believe it's a necessary change to position Starbucks for future success — and to ensure we deliver for our green apron partners and the customers they serve.""

Of course, when you pick up a last-gen smartphone, there will always be a few concessions. So what sacrifices can you expect to make with the Edge Plus (2023), and is it worth the new $399.99 price tag? Let's break it down. 
Motorola Edge Plus (2023) 512GB: $699.99 $399.99 at Amazon
The Motorola Edge Plus (2023) may be getting on in years, but it's still an impressive flagship phone with a stunning 165Hz pOLED display, two-day battery, and the efficient Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset. You even get 512GB of storage!
I certainly wouldn't buy it at full price, but thanks to this 43% discount at Amazon, the Edge Plus (2023) has suddenly become one of the best cheap Android phones on the market. 
✅Recommended if: you want an unlocked smartphone with a gorgeous display, over two days of battery life, and solid performance for under $400; you don't mind using a last-gen device. 
❌Skip this deal if: you want a phone with all of the latest features; you take lots of pictures or videos with your smartphone; you can afford a newer device. 
Despite its age, the Edge Plus (2023) remains one of the best Motorola phones on the market, and this new discount only makes the phone more agreeable for folks who have been on the fence. The 165Hz display is still fantastic to look at, and the two-day battery can easily match the best modern devices from Samsung or Google.
Sure, if you're accustomed to using something like the Galaxy S25 Ultra or the Pixel 9 Pro, you'll probably notice that the Edge Plus' Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset isn't as fast as the best Android phones around, but it could easily hold its own against a midrange device like the Google Pixel 8a. Motorola's software promise also guarantees that the Edge Plus (2023) will receive OS updates through Android 15, so you don't need to worry about the phone feeling obsolete any time soon.
If money is no object and you want all of the latest technology and AI features, then the Motorola Edge Plus (2023) isn't the phone for you. But if you simply want a reliable, stylish device with great performance and battery life for under $500, then you simply can't beat this Motorola discount.

        Worries about an unwelcome mix of inflation and stagnating economic growth are back, only this time such fears are becoming harder for investors to shake off.
    "
25,2025-02-24,"These five stocks represent compelling investment opportunities for March 2025, offering a mix of ... [+] growth potential, competitive advantages, and strong fundamentals.
In today's market environment, finding the right stocks requires careful analysis of company fundamentals and broader economic trends. With inflation showing signs of cooling and the Federal Reserve hinting at potential rate cuts later this year, certain sectors are particularly well-positioned for growth. This article examines five compelling stock picks that offer strong potential for capital appreciation and steady returns.
These selections come from diverse sectors, including technology, healthcare and consumer discretionary, providing investors with opportunities for portfolio diversification. Each company demonstrates solid fundamentals, strong market positioning, and compelling growth catalysts, making them attractive investment options for March 2025 and beyond.
This selection process focused on companies with strong fundamentals, sustainable competitive advantages and clear growth catalysts. I evaluated each stock using a comprehensive framework that considered financial metrics such as revenue growth, profit margins and return on equity, as well as qualitative factors, including market position, management quality and industry trends. Special attention was paid to companies with proven track records of navigating economic uncertainties while maintaining strong balance sheets.
Additionally, I considered current market conditions and sector-specific trends that could impact performance over the next 12-24 months. Each company was assessed for its valuation relative to peers and historical averages, ensuring that our picks offer reasonable entry points for investors despite the market's recent gains.
Microsoft continues to dominate the enterprise software market while making significant strides in cloud computing and artificial intelligence. The company's Azure cloud platform has become a cornerstone of its business, consistently gaining market share against competitors. Microsoft's strategic acquisition of Activision Blizzard and its partnership with OpenAI has further strengthened its position in gaming and AI technologies, creating multiple growth vectors for the future.
Microsoft's compelling investment case rests on its exceptional market position across multiple high-growth segments and its proven ability to monetize new technologies. The company's AI integration across its product suite, particularly in Microsoft 365 and Azure, has created significant competitive advantages and new revenue streams. With enterprise IT spending expected to remain robust and the continued shift toward cloud computing, Microsoft is well-positioned to maintain its growth trajectory.
Furthermore, with nearly one billion dollars in cash and liquid assets (MSFT 10K), Microsoft's strong balance sheet provides ample resources for continued innovation and strategic acquisitions. The company's consistent dividend growth and share buyback program offer additional value to shareholders, making it an attractive option for growth and income investors.
UnitedHealth Group is the largest healthcare company by revenue globally, operating through two platforms: UnitedHealthcare (health insurance) and Optum (healthcare services). The company's integrated approach to healthcare delivery and technology-driven solutions has created a powerful competitive moat. Its Optum division continues to drive innovation in healthcare delivery while expanding margins.
UnitedHealth's combination of scale, technological innovation and vertical integration makes it uniquely positioned to benefit from healthcare sector growth. The company's investments in artificial intelligence and data analytics are improving operational efficiency and patient outcomes while reducing costs. The aging U.S. population and increasing healthcare spending provide strong secular tailwinds for continued growth. The drop in price after its CEO was assassinated brought the company down to a more attractive level.
The company's consistent execution and strong financial performance, evidenced by nearly double-digit consecutive quarters of earnings beats, demonstrate management's ability to navigate complex healthcare regulations while maintaining profitability. UnitedHealth's dividend growth history and reasonable payout ratio suggest room for continued dividend increases.
This stock looks even more attractive after its 12% drop on February 21, following the U.S. Department of Justice's announcement of a civil fraud probe into the company’s Medicare billing. I believe this lawsuit does not significantly threaten the company’s long-term prospects. The market may be reacting out of fear, especially with the upcoming trial of Luigi Mangione, the suspected murderer of UNH’s CEO, which could be casting a negative spotlight on the company. I suggest waiting for a slightly more significant pullback and buying at $435 per share.
Mastercard's global payment network continues benefiting from the shift toward digital payments and e-commerce. The company's technology processes billions of transactions annually across more than 210 countries and territories. Beyond its core payment processing business, Mastercard has successfully expanded into value-added services, including cybersecurity, data analytics, and consulting, creating additional revenue streams and strengthening its relationships with financial institutions.
Mastercard's investment appeal lies in its powerful network effects, high margins and exposure to global digital payment trends. The company's asset-light business model generates significant free cash flow, allowing for continued investment in technology and strategic acquisitions. Its expansion into emerging markets and new payment technologies, including blockchain and real-time payments, positions it well for future growth.
Recent partnerships with fintech companies and investments in open banking capabilities demonstrate Mastercard's commitment to innovation and market expansion. With global digital payment volumes expected to grow at a CAGR of 20% through 2027, Mastercard is well-positioned to capture a significant share of this growth.
Eli Lilly has emerged as a leader in innovative therapeutics, particularly in diabetes, obesity and Alzheimer's disease treatments. The company's GLP-1 receptor agonists, including Mounjaro and Zepbound, have demonstrated exceptional efficacy in treating type 2 diabetes and obesity, creating a massive market opportunity. Additionally, its Alzheimer's drug donanemab has shown promising results in clinical trials.
Eli Lilly's strong position in the rapidly growing weight loss drug market represents a significant growth driver. Market estimates suggest the obesity market could reach $100 billion by 2030, with Eli Lilly positioned to capture a substantial share. The company's robust pipeline, including potential breakthrough treatments for Alzheimer's and cancer, provides multiple pathways for future growth.
The company's consistent investment in R&D, strong patent protection for key drugs, and proven ability to bring innovative treatments to market make it an attractive long-term investment. With healthcare spending expected to grow globally, Eli Lilly's focus on chronic diseases and unmet medical needs positions it well for sustained growth.
Costco's membership-based warehouse club model demonstrates remarkable resilience and growth potential. The company's focus on providing high-quality products at competitive prices has created strong customer loyalty, evidenced by its industry-leading membership renewal rates of over 90%. Costco's expansion into e-commerce and international markets provides additional growth opportunities while maintaining its core value proposition.
Costco's competitive advantages stem from its efficient operations, strong purchasing power, and loyal customer base. The company's membership model provides predictable recurring revenue, while its reputation for quality and value helps it maintain market share even during economic downturns. Recent investments in digital capabilities and supply chain optimization have improved operational efficiency and customer experience.
The company's international expansion plans, particularly in China and other Asian markets, offer significant growth potential. With 29 new warehouse openings planned for fiscal 2025 and continued growth in e-commerce sales, Costco is well-positioned to maintain its growth trajectory while returning value to shareholders through regular dividends and special dividend payments.
Bottom Line
These five stocks represent compelling investment opportunities for March 2025, offering a mix of growth potential, competitive advantages, and strong fundamentals. While Microsoft and Mastercard provide exposure to digital transformation and financial technology trends, UnitedHealth Group and Eli Lilly offer stakes in healthcare innovation and demographic trends. Costco rounds out the selection with its defensive characteristics and steady growth potential. When making investment decisions, investors should always consider their investment goals, risk tolerance, and portfolio diversification."

Healthcare startups are hoping for more M&A in the market this year after a three-year drought of company combinations. But most VCs aren't expecting to reap blockbuster returns through big healthcare deals anytime soon.

        The industry's historical mega-buyers — from Big Tech and retail to health plans and private equity — don't seem to have much of an appetite for big digital health deals this year, according to nearly a dozen VCs and investment bankers Business Insider spoke to.
    

        Big Tech companies like Amazon and retailers like Walgreens have already made multibillion-dollar buys in healthcare and, in some cases, been burned by their losses. Insurers like United Healthcare are facing mounting scrutiny, said these investors. While private equity seems increasingly interested in healthcare technologies, many of PE firms' recent big healthcare buys have been public companies, and often those already demonstrating stable revenue and profitability, rather than high-growth startups.
    

        Many healthcare startups are looking to get bought or raising down rounds to extend their lifespans, sometimes offering discounts on their last-round valuations to make a deal happen, BI reported in November. Better-performing startups, especially later-stage players, may not want to sell as investors hope for a reopening in the IPO markets that could help them recoup their returns, VCs told BI.
    

        On the bright side, those descending valuations offer plenty of opportunities for late-stage digital health startups flush with cash and looking to grow. Healthcare startups like Transcarent have already announced acquisitions this year, while others like Datavant have signaled they're ready for an M&A spree.
    

        Still, the outsize returns VCs depend on might be out of reach through healthcare M&A for the time being.
    

        ""M&A can be a great outcome. It just feels like there's not a lot of buyers that can do the kinds of deals that we would hope for for that big outcome,"" said IVP partner Yuri Lee.
    

        2024 brought a reckoning for retail healthcare as a number of large companies looked to downsize, sell off, or shut down their healthcare bets.
    

Walmart shut down its entire Walmart Health division in April, including its 51 health centers and its virtual care services. Walgreens closed at least 160 of its VillageMD primary care clinics throughout the year; the pharmacy retailer said in an August securities filing that it was considering selling part or all of its controlling stake in VillageMD, which Walgreens paid more than $6 billion for.
    

        CVS, which owns a number of healthcare businesses, including the insurer Aetna and the primary care clinic chain Oak Street Health, swapped out its CEOs in October after undergoing a strategic review, where the company reportedly considered splitting up its retail and insurance businesses as it faced rising costs from Medicare Advantage claims, according to Reuters. (For its part, CVS has forged on with its expansion of Oak Street Health, which it bought for $10.6 billion in 2023. The pharmacy business continued opening new clinics throughout the year as other retailers backed off their own in-person healthcare bets.)
    

A CVS Health spokesperson declined to comment for this story but said the company is ""focused on executing on our integrated care strategy."" Walmart declined to comment. Walgreens didn't respond to a request for comment.


        Some of Big Tech's healthcare investments underwent their own struggles last year. While Amazon's pharmacy business is drawing more consumer interest, its primary care business One Medical, which Amazon said in 2022 it was acquiring for $3.9 billion, lost Google as a large enterprise client in 2024 and faced an ongoing wrongful death lawsuit. Amazon also scrapped its telehealth business, Amazon Care, in 2022.
    

Amazon declined to comment on its M&A strategy. A spokesperson said the company is committed to One Medical's continued growth and plans to expand next to New Jersey, Northeast Ohio, and Westchester County, New York. The spokesperson said One Medical has contracts with around 10,000 employers and growing.


        Investors said that while players like Amazon may look around for smaller acquisitions to tack onto their existing offerings — especially those they can get at a discount — those buyers aren't likely to take another big swing anytime soon.
    

        ""I think it's fair to say that they've had a lot of large-scale failures in trying to buy nationally scaled assets that would impose consistency on the system. It just doesn't work like that,"" said Dan Mendelson, the CEO of JPMorgan's healthcare fund Morgan Health, of large tech and retail companies like Amazon. ""As soon as you move to more of a national system, you lose the quality control and a lot of the economic viability.""
    

        For the likely buyers among health insurance's top players, federal scrutiny and a public reckoning could hamper megadeals this year.
    

        UnitedHealth Group's Optum spent more than $31 billion on acquisitions between 2022 and 2024. UnitedHealth is currently trying to close a $3.3 billion deal to acquire home-health company Amedisys. But the Department of Justice sued to block the merger in November, citing antitrust concerns.
    

        Some other health plan mergers fell through last year, including early talks between Anthem and Cigna about a potential combination, per Bloomberg. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana also called off plans to sell itself to Elevance Health in February after facing regulatory pushback.
    

        For health plans, the elephant in the room is the December murder of former UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, which ignited a public outcry over how health insurers pay for patient care, or, more accurately, how frequently they deny paying for it. PitchBook senior healthcare analyst Aaron DeGagne said insurers may seek to lay low for the next few months as criticism mounts — ""A lot of things could be misinterpreted,"" he said.
    

        Despite those headwinds, DeGagne noted that health plans are hoping to tap into recent advancements in healthcare AI technologies to make their prior authorization and claims processes more efficient. He said he thinks health plans will notch more startup partnerships this year, and likely make their own investments in the sector, before they turn to acquisitions.
    

UnitedHealth Group didn't respond to requests for comment for this story.


        Private equity firms have remained active in healthcare and shelled out billions of dollars on a handful of deals last year, like R1 RCM's August take-private by two private equity firms for $8.9 billion, the second biggest US healthcare deal in 2024, according to PitchBook.
    

        Private equity's healthcare interest could certainly continue through 2025, especially as firms hope for falling interest rates and less regulatory scrutiny under a new presidential administration.
    

        However, private equity firms often require acquisitions to be profitable or nearly profitable. In VC, investors aren't exactly itching to sell off their late-stage profitable healthcare bets — since many of those could be candidates for IPOs once the public markets reopen, Mendelson said.
    

        ""It is definitely the case that private equity buyers are attractive to middle-market companies. But the larger companies have to be thinking about an IPO,"" he said.
    

        Moreover, private equity's healthcare playbook has historically relied on buying up individual healthcare practices, like medspas or home health centers. Those models generally bring in slower but more reliable revenue streams rather than explosive growth potential. Healthtech, a VC favorite, wasn't significantly represented in the top megadeals last year — of the 25 biggest US healthcare and life sciences deals in 2024, R1 RCM was the only true healthtech deal, with most of the other deals being in healthcare services or biopharma, per PitchBook.
    

        So while private equity could certainly look to buy more healthcare companies this year, they may not be the sexy deals VCs are looking for, said Krish Ramadurai, a partner at AIX Ventures.
    

        ""A lot of the boring services companies with great margins and great product market fit are prime takeouts right now. And if you have the AI angle, even better,"" he said.
    

        This year, some of the most active buyers of venture-backed healthcare startups may just be other startups.
    

        Several healthcare startups have signaled their intentions to look for M&A in 2024. Datavant CEO Kyle Armbrester told Business Insider in January that the $7 billion health data startup plans to make more acquisitions this year, a strategy that could help the company continue to grow its revenue ahead of a potential IPO. Other startups approaching public market debuts may use a similar playbook, like Hinge Health, which has been open about its plans to make more acquisitions for its physical therapy business.
    

        Venture capital firms may also work to combine multiple companies within their portfolios to minimize their losses, as healthcare firm 7wireVentures did in selling mental health investment Caraway to its pediatric healthcare investment Summer Health. General Catalyst has taken the same approach for numerous healthcare deals over the years; most recently, its health software bet Commure acquired care navigation platform Memora Health in December.
    

        In fact, a number of General Catalyst's portfolio companies look poised to make acquisitions this year. One of its investments, health benefits platform Transcarent, already made a big bet with its $621 million acquisition of healthcare navigator Accolade in January. Commure has taken an M&A-forward strategy to drive its growth, with seven acquisitions to date, including two in 2024. Care enablement startup Fabric has made four acquisitions since launching out stealth in early 2023, and CEO Aniq Rahman told Business Insider in September that the company was still looking for deals.
    

        ""A lot of the companies that are struggling to go raise capital right now, or some of these larger businesses that are reevaluating their position in the market, are creating opportunities for us as well,"" Rahman said. ""Pretty much every week, there's inbound coming in from investors that are like, we have assets in our portfolio that may be accretive to what you're doing with Fabric.""
    

        All told, there may yet be options for digital health startups hoping to get acquired and for the investors desperate for returns, even if billion-dollar deals aren't on the table.
    

        ""Founders and investors are getting impatient over exit timelines, and they can only stay impatient for so long,"" Pitchbook's DeGagne said.

28,2025-02-24,"Nvidia (NVDA-7.37%) stock advanced by more than 3% ahead of the AI chip giant’s scheduled release of its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the close today. The shares of chip designers Broadcom (AVGO-5.70%) and Micron (MU-5.80%) also gained.
The company is expected to report revenue of $38.1 billion, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS+0.16%). Net income is estimated to be $19.6 billion, or 85 cents a share, for the period ended in January.
Nvidia set its fiscal fourth quarter revenue guidance at $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, during its last report. FactSet analysts are expecting Nvidia to set fiscal first-quarter guidance at $42 billion.
After Chinese AI startup DeepSeek spooked investors in January, Nvidia’s stock plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record loss for a U.S. company. In December, the Hangzhou-based AI startup released DeepSeek-V3, a model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia’s reduced-capability H800 chips.
Earlier this month, however, JPMorgan U.S. Equity Research (JPM-0.05%) analysts said in a report that DeepSeek is likely to have a positive impact on Nvidia. DeepSeek’s demonstration of cost-efficiency and AI innovation will lead to “strong demand” for higher-performance graphics processing units, or GPUs, the analysts said. So Nvidia’s leadership in advanced AI chips “should enable them to unlock new use-cases.”
Nvidia’s stock experienced an extended rally last week and has recovered about 90% of the value lost during the sell-off. 
In a note on Friday, Jefferies (JEF-1.31%) analysts noted Nvidia’s stock rally but said it “has been relatively range bound” since November due to fears from the broader market over “a slower ramp in Blackwell shipments.” 
Despite concerns over supply chain issues for Blackwell, Jefferies analysts said they “believe” Nvidia will deliver a beat and a raise, although “the magnitude is likely to be smaller than the typical $2-3B range.”
“We continue to like NVDA during product ramps,” Jefferies analysts said, adding that it expects  “the beats to reaccelerate” in the second half of the year as Blackwell continues to expand.

(Photo by Markku Ulander / Lehtikuva / AFP) / Finland OUT (Photo by MARKKU ULANDER/Lehtikuva/AFP via Getty Images)
Nokia stock (NYSE: NOK) has outperformed since the start of 2024, rising by approximately 52% (Feb. 20) since January 2024, while the broader S&P 500 has gained around 28% during the same period. Similarly, Nokia’s peer Ericsson stock (NASDAQ: ERIC) has increased by 33% over the same timeframe. What is driving this trend?
See more on Trefis.com
Nokia posted a strong Q4 earnings beat, reporting Q4 EPS of €0.18, which exceeded analyst forecasts of €0.14. This compares to earnings of €0.10 per share in the same quarter last year. Although revenue slightly missed expectations at €5.98 billion (around $6.5 billion) versus €6.00 billion, it still grew 10% year-over-year in Q4. However, full-year revenues declined by 9% year-over-year to €19.2 billion because of segment-specific challenges. The core mobile networks unit faced a 21% year-over-year sales drop in 2024, mainly driven by reduced activities in India and North America. Revenues from network infrastructure and cloud network services each fell by 6% year-over-year, owing to weak demand for internet protocol—particularly in the Americas and EMEA regions. Meanwhile, Nokia Technologies emerged as the top-performing segment with a remarkable 78% increase in net sales, largely fueled by new licensing agreements that support the company’s strategy to leverage its intellectual property. Despite these revenue headwinds, full-year profitability increased by 40% in FY 2024, as proactive cost management and improved gross margins helped offset the slower sales recovery. Additionally, if you prefer a smoother ride than investing in an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has not only outperformed the S&P 500 but also delivered over 91% returns since inception.
Nokia’s sales mix has shifted in recent quarters due to regional differences. In particular, U.S. sales have declined as customers work through their existing 5G equipment inventory. Looking ahead, Nokia has issued guidance for FY 2025, forecasting operating profits between €1.9 billion and €2.4 billion ($2.1 billion to $2.5 billion). The company also expects its full-year free cash flow to account for 50% to 80% of operating profit. For 2026, Nokia anticipates operating margins exceeding 13% and free cash flow representing 55% to 85% of operating profit.
The performance of NOK stock over the past four years has been inconsistent, with annual returns exhibiting much greater volatility than the S&P 500. The stock delivered returns of 59% in 2021, -24% in 2022, -24% in 2023, and 34% in 2024. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, which comprises 30 stocks, is significantly less volatile and has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four years. Why is that? As a group, the stocks in the HQ Portfolio have delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index—a much smoother ride, as evidenced by the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
Is Nokia stock worth considering at its current price of about $4.99 per share (Feb 20)? Although growth may remain elusive this year and historical risk-adjusted returns have been weak, there are still several reasons to consider Nokia stock. Its valuation appears reasonable, with the stock trading at around 15x consensus 2025 earnings—compared to Ericsson’s roughly 17x forward earnings. Furthermore, Nokia may be better positioned to weather a potential slowdown in wireless infrastructure spending, given its presence in the fixed-line space. We estimate Nokia stock to be worth $5.01 per share, which aligns with the current market price. For further details on our valuation, see our analysis on Nokia Valuation: Expensive or Cheap.

32,2025-02-24,"The Oppo Find N5 will not be launching in Europe, the company confirms.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Oppo just unveiled its latest creation, the Find N5, which is the slimmest foldable phone they’ve ever made, and for the global markets. However, it seems like Oppo might not be expanding its release even in Europe.
The company has confirmed in a statement given to a YouTuber, The Tech Chap (via 9to5Google), alongside ComputerBase publication indicating that it isn’t bringing its thinnest foldable, the Find N5, to the continent. It also means the device is highly unlikely to be available in Germany as well.
Here’s the statement given by Oppo:
“At OPPO, we carefully tailor our product launchers to each region based on in-depth market research and strategic priorities. The Find N5 will not be launching in Europe. Instead, in Q1 2025, we will introduce the Reno13 series across Europe on February 24, offering consumers more choices with cutting-edge AI features and stylish, trend-forward designs. Stay tuned for updates.”
The latest update should be quite disappointing for consumers across Europe and the U.K. region as the Find N5 has been one of the most anticipated foldable phones the tech industry has witnessed recently. Oppo’s sibling OnePlus has also recently announced that it isn’t bringing any foldable this year, closing the gates of the OnePlus Open 2.
It has also been the highly anticipated device, and ever since the Find N5 surfaced on the web, rumors were floating around that it could be dubbed the OnePlus Open 2 in global markets including Europe, the U.K., and the U.S.

The Oppo Find N5 made its debut on February 20 in Singapore, marking a global launch. Even in the accompanying press release, the company noted that the Find N5 “marks a new phase in Oppo’s global expansion.” On the contrary, the device is skipping markets like the U.K., the U.S., and Europe.

Other than the availability aspect of the Find N5, the foldable phone turned out to be a great handset, making the competition sweat. The device’s ultra-thin design, ability to easily hold and use, and no visible crease, alongside a great display, battery, and IPX9 ingress protection, happen to be the key takeaways of the Find N5, which is about to go on sale in the coming weeks.

Chinese e-commerce and cloud giant Alibaba stock surged nearly 8% in Thursday’s trading after the company delivered better-than-expected Q3 results (fiscal year ends in March), propelled by robust performance in its Cloud Intelligence division and core e-commerce operations. Alibaba’s net income reached 48.945 billion yuan ($6.7 billion), up from 14.43 billion yuan ($2 billion) in the same period last year.

Although China’s retail market has been mixed in recent quarters due to uncertain consumer sentiment and decelerating economic growth following the real estate crisis, recent figures indicate a modest rebound. Chinese retail sales increased by a better-than-expected 3.7% year-over-year in December, partly fueled by aggressive government stimulus measures including interest rate cuts and a substantial fiscal package. In the last quarter, Alibaba reported that its key Chinese e-commerce platforms, Taobao and Tmall Group, experienced a 5% revenue increase to 136.1 billion yuan ($18.75 billion). In addition to the overall recovery in the retail sector, Alibaba has been refining its strategy to compete with value-driven rivals such as PDD Holdings, the proprietor of discount platforms like Pinduoduo and Temu. Furthermore, Alibaba’s cross-border e-commerce platforms, including AliExpress, have emerged as significant growth drivers, with revenues soaring 32% to 37.8 billion yuan ($5.2 billion) in the most recent quarter. This surge is likely attributed to robust performance from initiatives like the AliExpress Choice program, which offers free shipping and additional benefits.
Looking ahead, Alibaba might benefit from its recently revised fee model, which replaces the annual fixed service fee for vendors with a 0.6% software service fee based on the gross merchandise value for transactions on Tmall and Taobao. This change could boost revenue from its core customer management services following substantial investments in its platforms and technology. Furthermore, the company’s digital marketing tool, Quanzhantui, is expected to enhance monetization for the Taobao and Tmall marketplaces.
Alibaba’s cloud computing segment performed strongly, with revenue increasing by 13% during the quarter, while revenue from AI-related products surged by triple-digit percentages for the sixth consecutive quarter. The company recently announced a partnership with Apple to integrate its AI services into the iPhone in China. According to The Information, Apple had also evaluated other Chinese AI firms including Baidu, ByteDance, and Tencent before ultimately selecting Alibaba, reflecting confidence in its AI capabilities. Furthermore, Alibaba is intensifying its AI investments, with planned spending on cloud computing and AI infrastructure over the next three years expected to exceed the total investments made over the past decade.
Overall optimism for China’s AI sector has increased following the launch of the DeepSeek AI model last month. DeepSeek offers performance nearly comparable to Open ChatGPT while using considerably less computing power. This advancement in domestic AI innovation could bolster Alibaba’s AI prospects, rendering its cloud and AI divisions more appealing to investors.
Notably, BABA stock has underperformed the broader market over each of the past four years. The stock returns were -49% in 2021, -26% in 2022, -11% in 2023, and 12% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, which comprises 30 stocks, exhibits lower volatility and has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why is that?Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; a less tumultuous performance as demonstrated in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics. In light of the current uncertain macroeconomic environment characterized by rate cuts and multiple conflicts, could BABA face a situation similar to that of 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months – or is a recovery in sight?
Following the recent strong rally, Alibaba stock is trading at approximately $140 per share, which is less than 16x the projected FY’25 earnings. This multiple would trend even lower if the company’s cash reserve of over $60 billion were excluded. In contrast, Amazon is trading at roughly 35x its forward earnings. We are currently revising our $108 price estimate for Alibaba stock. Review our analysis of Alibaba’s valuation and Alibaba revenues.

[Note: Walmart’s Fiscal Year 2025 ended on January 31, 2025]
Walmart’s (NYSE: WMT) most recent quarterly results were mixed, resulting in a 7% decline in shares on February 20th. The company’s Q4 figures surpassed analyst estimates for both revenue and profit. However, the Q4 outperformance was moderated by a cautious forecast, as the retailer expects slowing profit growth despite robust holiday-quarter outcomes: 4% year-over-year (y-o-y) revenue growth, a 9% y-o-y rise in adjusted operating income, and a 20% surge in e-commerce sales. Notably, the company’s stock has increased 8% year-to-date compared to a 4% rise in the S&P 500 index (as of Feb. 20). In contrast, WMT’s peer Target (NYSE: TGT) has experienced a 6% decline in its stock over the same period.
In FY’26 (year ending January 2026), Walmart projects net sales growth of 3-4% and an increase in adjusted operating income of 3.5-5.5% on a constant currency basis. This forecast factors in a 150-basis-point drag from its Vizio acquisition and the impact of a non-leap year. Notably, this growth rate is slower than the 9.7% rise in adjusted operating income that Walmart achieved in FY’25. The company also expects adjusted earnings of $2.50-$2.60 per share for the full year, excluding any potential effects from pending tariffs. Additionally, if you prefer an investment with less volatility than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and delivered over 91% returns since inception.
We have updated Walmart’s Valuation to $98 per share, based on an expected EPS of $2.56 and a 38.4x P/E multiple for fiscal year 2026 – nearly matching the current market price. We also project Walmart’s Revenues to reach $704 billion in fiscal year 2026, representing a 3% y-o-y increase. It is important to note that Walmart currently carries $45.5 billion in debt and holds a cash position of $9 billion. With financing rates significantly higher than in previous years, this substantial debt not only heightens long-term risk for the retailer but also increases interest costs. Moreover, the retailer experienced slowing U.S. comparable sales growth during FY’25. Although quarterly growth rates remained positive, they did show signs of deceleration: 4.9% in Q1’25, 4.2% in Q2’25, 5.1% in Q3’25, and 4.6% in Q4’25.
In Q4, Walmart’s transactions rose by 2.8% during the quarter, and the average ticket size increased by 1.8%. The company’s revenue climbed 4.1% y-o-y to $180.6 billion. Additionally, WMT’s global advertising segment expanded by approximately 29% during the quarter, with Walmart Connect in the U.S. growing by 24%. The retailer’s adjusted EPS reached $0.66, a 10% y-o-y increase driven by Q4 operating income growth.
The performance of WMT stock over the past four years has been inconsistent, with annual returns exhibiting significantly more volatility than the S&P 500. The stock returned 2% in 2021, 0% in 2022, 13% in 2023, and 74% in 2024. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio—which consists of 30 stocks—shows considerably less volatility, and it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why is that? Collectively, the stocks in the HQ Portfolio have delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index, offering a smoother ride as reflected in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
It is useful to examine how Walmart’s peers compare. The WMT Peers page displays how Walmart’s stock stacks up against its peers on key metrics. Additional valuable comparisons for companies across various industries can be found on the Peer Comparisons page.

Many investors who prospered from gold’s bull market will be surprised by how profits on their gold investments are taxed.
Gold is a collectible in the tax code, giving it less favorable treatment than most other investments.
The first unfavorable treatment is that IRAs and other individually-directed retirement accounts (both traditional and Roth versions) aren’t allowed to own collectibles. The purchase of a collectible is treated as a distribution to the IRA owner. There are exceptions for certain types of coins and bullion. I won’t the treatment of collectibles in retirement accounts in detail in this post but discuss some major rules.
The second unfavorable treatment is that sales of collectibles in taxable accounts have a maximum long-term capital gains tax rate of 28% instead of the 20% top rate for other investments.
The exceptions for certain gold coins and bullion that apply to retirement plans don’t apply to the maximum long-term capital gains rate.
Exactly how gold is taxed varies based on how you choose to invest. I’ll review the major investment vehicles.
Bullion. The classic way to invest in gold is to buy bullion as either coins or bars that you either hold yourself or have stored at a facility.
Long-term gains on bullion are taxed at your ordinary income tax rate up to a maximum rate of 28%. That’s not a flat rate of 28%. Profits in gold are taxed at the lower of your ordinary income tax rate and 28%.
Short-term gains on bullion, like other investments, are taxed as ordinary income. An asset must be held for more than one year for any gains or losses to be long-term.
Before determining taxes on capital gains, a taxpayer first offsets, or nets, gains and losses against each other.
First, sales of collectibles are separated from sales of other investments. Then, in each category, transactions are separated into those held for one year or less (short-term gains and losses) and those held for more than one year (long-term gains and losses).
The short-term gains and losses are applied against each other to determine if there is a net short-term gain or loss. The same is done with long-term transactions.
Then, the net short-term gain or loss is applied against the net long-term gain or loss for each category.
Suppose an investor had $15,000 of losses and $5,000 of gains in his short-term non-collectible investments. That’s a $10,000 net short-term loss.
The investor also had in long-term non-collectible transactions $5,000 of losses and $10,000 of gains. That’s a net $5,000 long-term gain for the year.
The investor nets the $10,000 net short-term loss against the $5,000 net long-term gain to arrive at a net $5,000 short-term capital gain loss for the year in non-collectible investments.
The collectible investment transactions are netted the same way.
A net loss in the non-collectible category can be applied against a net gain in the collectibles. A long-term capital loss carryforward from previous years also can be applied against net gains in the collectibles.
Only after the full netting process is the capital gains tax computed on the net gain or loss. Through this process losses in non-collectible investments can reduce taxable gains in collectibles.
There are a few cases when a taxpayer will pay more than a 28% rate on net long-term gains from collectibles, such as when the alternative minimum tax applies or the taxpayer takes the Section 199A qualified business income deduction available to the self -employed and some owners of pass-through entities, such as partnerships and S corporations.
The tax rate also will be higher when the taxpayer is subject to the 3.8% net investment income tax.
The taxpayer’s state also might impose an income tax on gains from collectibles.
ETFs. A cheaper and more liquid way to own gold is through exchange-traded funds. The ETF is likely to pay much less than you for insurance, shipping, and storage and likely will pay a lower bid/ask spread when buying and selling.
The main gold ETFs are organized as trusts with ownership interests that trade on the stock exchanges.
You can buy or sell their shares any time the markets are open and as quickly as any stock. The ETFs generally trade at very modest premiums or discounts to net asset value.
The shares of the ETFs are investments in collectibles for purposes of the capital gains tax rules, according to IRS rulings. Sales of shares of the ETFs in taxable accounts will be taxed the same as bullion.
But shares of the ETFs are not considered prohibited collectibles for IRAs. The investor is purchasing shares of a fund. The shareowner does not have a legal claim on a share of the bullion held by the ETF and cannot force a distribution. If the ETF gives the investor a claim on gold and the right to force a distribution of bullion, then it is treated the same as direct ownership of bullion.
Futures. You can trade gold futures yourself or own an ETF that does the trading.
Futures contracts aren’t considered direct ownership of gold, so they aren’t collectibles, though not all IRA custodians allow futures investments.
Futures are taxed very differently from other investments, and an owner of a futures ETF is taxed just as if the owner held the individual futures contracts.
All gains in futures are treated as 60% short-term and 40% long-term, regardless of the holding period. In addition, the futures contracts are marked to market at the end of each calendar year, and taxes are computed on the paper gains and losses.
Most ETFs that trade futures contracts past their gains and losses to shareholders’ tax returns each year. Net gains must be included in gross income, even if there weren’t any distributions and the investor didn’t sell any fund shares.
Indirect ownership through ETNs. An ETN is a note, or debt, in which the note issuer (usually a major bank or broker) owes the investor the initial investment plus or minus the return of an index, changes in the spot price of an asset, or some other benchmark. Shares of an ETN are traded on the exchanges just like stock shares.
If the firm backing the ETN has financial difficulties, the note might not be paid in full. Bankruptcy of the issuing firm could result in a complete loss.
In general, an ETN is taxed the same as a bond or bond fund. Upon a sale, the investor has a gain or loss that can be short-term or long-term, depending on how long the ETN was held.
Any distributions from the ETF are treated as interest income.
Owning an ETN shouldn’t be treated as ownership of a collectible or a futures contract, regardless of the underlying asset tracked by the ETN. But the IRS hasn’t issued definitive rules on the taxation of ETNs.
Equities. An investor can purchase the shares of companies that mine and produce gold and perhaps other metals.
For tax purposes, shares of gold mining companies are treated the same as other stocks, not as collectibles. Gold miners’ shares can be owned in IRA.
When owned in taxable accounts, the shares qualify for the regular maximum long-term capital gains rate when held for more than one year, not the collectibles tax rate. Shorter holding periods result in short-term capital gains. Losses also are deducted the same as capital losses on other stock shares.
Gold mining company shares can be purchased individually, through open-end mutual funds, or through ETFs."

Asian equities were largely lower despite a weaker U.S. dollar overnight, as Japan outperformed and India underperformed.
Hong Kong-listed growth stocks were hit with profit-taking, triggered by President Donald Trump’s last Friday night release stating “The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) will be used to restrict Chinese investments in strategic U.S. sectors like technology, critical infrastructure, healthcare, agriculture, energy, raw materials, and others.” China’s corporate investment in the U.S. has gone basically to zero, so restricting zero means zero, as the tough language has little bite.
Ironically, the China-based health care companies that have built U.S. facilities and hired U.S. employees were off the most. Wuxi Biologics was down -9.04% and Wuxi AppTec was down -10.14%, as healthcare underperformed in both Hong Kong and Mainland China. Health care stocks had been picking up on government policy support for biotech and new drug innovation.
The White House release also alluded to looking at U.S.-listed China stocks’ variable interest entity structures, despite the companies adhering to PCAOB audit reviews. The release was harsh in repeatedly calling China a “foreign adversary”, which should make US companies with high China revenues nervous, though maybe this is the “Art of the Deal”.
Hong Kong-listed internet stocks were off on profit -taking. This is despite the fact that Alibaba, which fell -2.02%, committed to invest $53 billion over the next three years “to advance its cloud computing and AI infrastructure”. The company stated that “cloud computing remains Alibaba’s clearest revenue driver in AI, with demand for AI hosting services surging”. Alibaba’s Cloud unit grew revenue by +11% year-over-year in the fourth quarter.
Real estate had a strong day as Shenzhen Metro, the Shenzhen local government, further supported distressed developer Vanke with another loan and reports of land sale prices increasing. Could the Vanke takeover playbook be repeated with other developers? We shall see.
Mainland investors bought the dip in Hong Kong today, with $1.77 billion of net buying, led by strong buying in both Alibaba and Xiaomi. Year-to-date, Mainland investors have bought a net $28.74 billion worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks via Southbound Stock Connect. Like in Hong Kong, Mainland China bounced around the room, though on very high turnover, exceeding RMB 2 trillion. As in Hong Kong, breadth (advancers vs. decliners) was mixed, as electric vehicle plays CATL and BYD fell -1.47% and -1.75%, respectively. It was a quiet night as Trip.com reported after the US close, today.

41,2025-02-24,"TD Cowen noticed Microsoft doing something strange on Friday. The Open AI partner and tech giant appeared to be cancelling data center leases. According to the market analysts, this is part of a wider pattern. TD Cowen said Microsoft had an âoversupplyâ problem. Itâs another datapoint that points to Big Techâs nervousness around its big bet on AI.
TD Cowen published its quick take on February 21 and said its research into Microsoftâs data center business had turned up something interesting. âOur channel checks indicate that [Microsoft] has 1) cancelled leases in the U.S. totalling âa couple of hundreds [megawatts]â with at least two private data center operators, 2) has pulled back on the conversion of [statements of qualification] to leases, and 3) has re-allocated a considerable portion of its international spend to the U.S.â
A statement of qualification or SOQ is a precursor to the signing of a lease. TD Cowen noted that the conversion rate of an SOQ into a signed lease is almost 100% so itâs odd for the tech giant to kill them. It could be a negotiation tactic or it could be a sign of a wider market shift. âWhen coupled with our prior channel checks, it points to a potential oversupply position for [Microsoft,]â TD Cowen said in its quick take.
The leases arenât the only sign that Microsoft is cooling down its AI spend. âMicrosoft walked away from multiple +100MW deals in multiple markets that were in early/ mid stages of negotiations, let a +1GW of [Letters of Intent] on larger footprint sites expire, and walked away from at least five land parcels that it had under construction in multiple Tier 1 markets,â TD Cowen said.
Part of whatâs going on is that Microsoft, like other tech companies, is promising to do more business in the U.S. following the election of Donald Trump. America and the markets are waiting with bated breath to see what effects Trumpâs tariffs and presidency will have on the market. Heâs deregulating AI but heâs also making everything more expensive. When the world becomes more uncertain, companies spend less.
In January Microsoft promised that it would spend $80 billion on data centers in America. Itâs also gone all in on small modular nuclear reactors to power these data centers and is even working on spinning up a long-dormant reactor at Three Mile Island. But it also paused construction on a data center meant to service Open AI in Wisconsin earlier this year, leaving $3.3 billion in limbo.
Microsoft has a hand in Open AI, which makes the popular ChatGPT. But it also owns CoPilot, a service itâs been trying to force on Windows and Office users. Everyone hates it. It runs Bing, an also-ran search engine thatâs incorporating more and more AI slop that everyone also hates.
CEO Satya Nadella pumped the brakes on AI hype in a podcast appearance last week, too. Nadella told Dwarkesh Patel that he didnât buy into the idea of artificial general intelligenceâsomething OpenAI founder Sam Altman has been bullish onâand said it was time for AI to start showing the market some returns.
According to TD Cowen, the signals all point to a reduction in AI-related spending from Microsoft. âThe magnitude of both potential data center capacity it walked away from and the decision to pullback on land acquisition (which supports core long-term capacity growth) in our view indicates the loss of a major demand signal that Microsoft was originally responding to and that we believe the shift in their appetite for capacity is tied to OpenAI,â it said.
Microsoft pushed back on some of this later when it talked to the business press. âWhile we may strategically pace or adjust our infrastructure in some areas, we will continue to grow strongly in all regions,â a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement to Bloomberg. âOur plans to spend over $80B on infrastructure this [financial year] remain on track as we continue to grow at a record pace to meet customer demand.â
Itâs unclear how much demand there actually is for massive data centers and the large language models they support.

42,2025-02-24,"NVIDIA's RTX 5000 GPU launch continues to aggravate PC enthusiasts as RTX 5070 performance leaks out amid reports of missing ROPs in the other ""Blackwell"" GPUs.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

NVIDIA's RTX 5000 GPU launch isn't finished disappointing the Team Green faithful. The RTX 5070, NVIDIA's delayed mid-range ""Blackwell"" GPU, is expected to launch on March 5, and a small bit of performance info has leaked out as reviewers are busy testing the GPUs.
The news comes from Videocardz, which spotted a Geekbench metric involving the RTX 5070, an AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D, and an X870E motherboard. Geekbench is but a small part of the full picture, but it gives an idea of what to expect from the final piece of NVIDIA's initial RTX 5000 launch run.
The RTX 5070 scored 187,414 using OpenCL and 188,712 using Vulkan in Geekbench 6. Looking at average scores for the RTX 5070 Ti (which are published on Geekbench's website), the RTX 5070 appears to offer about 20% less performance than its Ti sibling.
As mentioned, this is far from a complete look at what the RTX 5070 can offer in terms of real-world gameplay performance, but it's not sitting well with NVIDIA's supporters.

As was discovered over the weekend and reported on by Tom's Hardware, some of NVIDIA's RTX 5090, RTX 5080, and RTX 5070 Ti GPUs are missing ROPs.
ROPs — also known as Render Output Units or Raster Operations Pipeline — are critical to a GPU's performance, and they're not something you should see fluctuate between different cards from different manufacturers as they're a part of the actual GPU chip. It suggests a problem with the actual GB202 and GB203 NVIDIA chips used in the new Blackwell cards.
👉 Read our NVIDIA RTX 5090 Founders Edition review
All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.
With users spotting up to 8 absent ROPs in their GPUs, it's not an insignificant issue. Tom's Hardware received an answer from an NVIDIA representative on the subject:
We have identified a rare issue affecting less than 0.5% (half a percent) of GeForce RTX 5090 / 5090D and 5070 Ti GPUs, which have one fewer ROP than specified. The average graphical performance impact is 4%, with no impact on AI and Compute workloads. Affected consumers can contact the board manufacturer for a replacement. The production anomaly has been corrected.
NVIDIA's answer to Tom's Hardware suggests that GPUs only have one missing ROP, but that's clearly not the case for all users. Some have demonstrated a higher number.
NVIDIA fessed up to the issue immediately and has offered a clear way for affected customers to exchange their faulty cards. However, this will only serve to deepen stock shortages that are already severe.
Now, with the RTX 5070's leaked performance, people are piling on with some seriously funny quotes. One NVIDIA subreddit user joked, ""So it's like a 5070 Ti with 8 missing ROPs."" Can't argue with that.
👉 Read our NVIDIA RTX 5080 Founders Edition review
It's expected that the RTX 5070 will have lesser performance than its RTX 5070 Ti sibling, but I don't think anyone was expecting a 20% difference. We'll have to wait for full reviews to get a better idea of the situation, but those CES promises of RTX 4090 performance from the $549 RTX 5070 aren't holding up well.
Mix this news with melting power cables, high prices, faulty NVIDIA drivers, lack of availability, and dropped 32-bit PhysX support (am I missing anything?) and you can see why NVIDIA is receiving so much flak.

AMD's decision to delay the official announcement and launch of its new RDNA 4 GPUs keeps looking better. It's done practically nothing save for teasing launch dates, allowing NVIDIA to harm itself entirely on its own.
AMD is expected to finally reveal its Radeon RX 9000 GPUs on February 28, and they should finally launch to the public in early March.
The wait is almost over. Join us on February 28 at 8 AM EST for the reveal of the next-gen @AMD Radeon RX 9000 Series. Get ready to make it yours when it hits shelves in early March. RSVP by subscribing to the AMD YouTube channel: https://t.co/4rkVxeoDIaFebruary 13, 2025
AMD still has plenty of opportunity to muck up its unveil and launch. If it hopes to succeed — even ignoring all of NVIDIA's current issues — there must be stock to buy, competitive pricing, and solid performance to compete with NVIDIA's mid-range GPUs.
As reported by Videocardz, AMD is targeting a 42% performance uplift in its Radeon RX 9070 XT compared to the last-gen RX 7900 GRE. That should place it above the RTX 5070, though some Geekbench performance leaks suggest otherwise.
Like the 5070 Ti, Radeon RX 9070 XT Geekbench results have also appeared. The GPU hits 179,178 in OpenCL and 177,395 in Vulkan, both scores lower than those seen in the RTX 5070 leak.
There's ultimately too much left up in the air to confirm anything. Once final Radeon drivers are in place and AMD has officially unveiled its new GPUs, we'll all have a much better idea of what the PC gaming landscape will look like for the next couple of years.
Until then, I can only hope that NVIDIA gets its act together and AMD comes out with some true competition.

For Ron Sliter, getting a master's degree seemed like a path to job security. After spending nearly two decades in the military, including eight tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, he attended graduate school with the help of the GI Bill and landed a job in IT administration. He looked forward to climbing the corporate ladder and enjoying a long, successful career in the civilian world.

        Then, in January 2023, he got laid off. Since then, he's applied to thousands of roles — to no avail. After more than two years, he's still unemployed. The whole experience, he says, feels like ""being caught in the middle of 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.'""
    

        ""It's disheartening,"" he tells me. ""They sell you on the dream, you fight for the dream, and you come back to take advantage of the dream that you fought for. And you realize it doesn't exist.""
    

        Sliter is part of a sudden spike in the number of highly educated professionals who are struggling to find a job — any job. According to government data analyzed by the economist Aaron Terrazas, professionals with advanced degrees who are looking for work find themselves stranded on the unemployment line for a median of 18 weeks — a jobless spell that has more than quadrupled over the past two years. And in a strange twist, job searches are now taking more than twice as long for educated elites than they are for workers who never went to college. At the moment, the higher your degree, the longer it will take for you to find a job.
    

        It's not news that we're in the midst of a sharp downturn in tech and finance — one that has hit highly credentialed professionals especially hard. I've been calling it a white-collar recession, assuming that it's temporary. It's normal, after all, to experience dips in the job market. There have been plenty of times over the years when Ph.D. holders faced longer job searches than high school graduates. But whatever the ups and downs, education — particularly an advanced degree — has generally provided a good buffer against financial insecurity.
    

        Lately, though, I've started to wonder if what we're seeing in the job market is a sign of something deeper. What if Sliter's protracted spell of joblessness is an early warning signal — an indication that the economy is undergoing a fundamental shift? What if, going forward, education no longer provides a path to economic security the way it once did?
    

        ""For 40 years, we've been talking about how more education leads to better labor market outcomes,"" says Terrazas, the former chief economist for Glassdoor. ""Suddenly, that feels like it's changing."" And the shift, he warns, could herald a profound ""moment of dislocation"" for today's white-collar professionals, just as blue-collar workers faced a seismic reckoning in the wake of globalization.
    

        ""What the early 2000s were for manufacturing workers, I worry that the mid-2020s are going to be for knowledge workers,"" Terrazas says. ""American manufacturing workers were told they were highly productive until global trade opened up, and then suddenly that changed. I worry that we're in a comparable moment for knowledge workers. They were told they were the most productive workers in the world. Suddenly that's being undermined.""
    

        Education has long served as a ticket to a better, more secure life. But rarely has it mattered more than in recent decades, with the rise of robots and computers and the internet. The more schooling you had, the more likely you were to survive the sudden technological disruption. Between 1980 and 2009, the economists Daron Acemoglu and David Autor found, wages increased modestly for those with a bachelor's degree, soared for those with an advanced degree, and tumbled for high school dropouts. Economists gave the phenomenon an awkward name: skill-biased technological change. In plainspeak: Get more degrees or you're screwed. Education was the one thing that kept you safe in an increasingly cutthroat economy.
    

        To secure their futures, an unprecedented number of young Americans enrolled in graduate schools, taking out big loans that they believed would yield even bigger payoffs down the road. Since 2000, the numbers of Americans with master's degrees and doctorates have more than doubled — while the ranks of those without a high school diploma shrank.
    

        But then, over the past few years, the demand for super-educated professionals suddenly took a deep dive. A variety of factors have combined to alter the white-collar landscape. The first was the pandemic-driven shift to remote work. No longer limited by the constraints of geography, American companies realized they could hire abroad, giving them access to a larger and cheaper pool of highly trained professionals. Suddenly, homegrown computer scientists, product managers, and data scientists — long treated as rare diamonds worthy of their high salaries — seemed more like overpriced commodities compared with their counterparts overseas.
    

        Another factor has been the big push among corporate recruiters to de-emphasize formal credentials in the hiring process, a trend known as ""skills-based hiring."" Some employers no longer list degree requirements in job postings; others have added the qualifier ""or equivalent experience."" That's giving people without the extra schooling a chance at landing the most coveted white-collar jobs — while undercutting the advantage long enjoyed by the advanced-degree holders.
    

        And then there's AI. As I've written before, studies show that chatbots and other AI tools are already providing a boost to those with the least skill and experience, while doing little to help high performers — the very people who likely got an advanced degree to hone their skills. What's more, early estimates suggest that in the long run, AI is most likely to displace white-collar professionals, while leaving most blue-collar jobs intact. And besides, getting an MBA or some other advanced degree didn't exactly prepare anyone for the sudden emergence of ChatGPT. The faster technology changes, the faster your fancy degree is likely to feel outdated. Terrazas found that the median age for those experiencing long-term unemployment is now 37 — meaning you don't have to be a boomer to feel like technology has passed you by.
    

        ""What we think of as 'old' is a lot younger now,"" Terrazas says. ""With the accelerated technical frontier, what it means to be out of date is creeping downward.""
    

        That's what happened to a millennial I'll call Tara. After earning her MBA from Cornell University in 2021, she was confident that all the hard work — and expense — was going to pay off. With a job offer from Amazon in hand, she moved across the country to Seattle, excited to live on her own for the first time and begin a brand-new career as a product manager. Whatever happened with the job, she figured there would always be plenty of companies eager to hire someone with a business degree from a top school.
    

        Then Tara got laid off during the tech downturn in November 2023 — and hasn't been able to land a new role. Unemployed for 14 months and counting, she's applied to something like 650 jobs. ""With every passing month, as my stress levels went up, my search criteria expanded,"" she tells me. ""I'm stumped at just how hard it's been.""
    

        Professionals with advanced degrees aren't just mired in longer job searches — they're facing what feels like a vicious circle: The longer they're out of work, the more obsolete their skills become, which in turn makes it even harder to find a job. As they grow increasingly dejected, some opt for lower-paying roles; others give up altogether. Economists refer to this as ""scarring,"" and it's one of the reasons they worry so much about long-term unemployment. It doesn't just hurt the people who can't find work. It also hurts the broader economy.
    

        The prospects for educated elites are so bleak that some have taken to hiding the credentials they worked so hard to earn. Scott Catey, a policy director who has both a JD and a Ph.D., says he sometimes leaves out the doctorate in job applications, to avoid being viewed as overqualified. Michael Borsellino, who has a doctorate in urban studies, started listing his degree as being in ""social sciences,"" to make it sound applicable to a wider range of jobs. The goal, he says, is ""not to pigeonhole myself.""
    

        Ever since the Industrial Revolution, the modern economy has been dividing up the workforce into ever-narrower specializations. A driving force in higher education, in fact, was to cultivate the sort of hyper-niche expertise that the marketplace demanded. But Terrazas says we're now starting to see the darker side of becoming really, really good at one thing. ""Specialization can create productivity-enhancing high returns,"" he says. ""But it can also create obsolescence.""
    

        Borsellino, who eventually landed a role at LinkedIn after a nine-month search, doesn't think his Ph.D. proved to be an asset.""If it did help, I feel like I wouldn't have been unemployed for as long as I was,"" he says. ""I don't know if it was a drain, but I don't think it was the end-all, be-all that I grew up believing it would be."" If he were thinking about getting a doctorate today, he's not sure he'd do it. ""I think we're at this point where experience is valued so much more that it's really, really difficult to justify doing the degree.""
    

        Advanced-degree holders, of course, continue to be the economy's overwhelming winners. Most of them are gainfully employed, with salaries that are typically far higher than anyone else's. And it's possible that the current hiring obstacles facing educated professionals will prove to be a temporary blip, just one more twist in a deeply strange pandemic-era economy that we've failed to understand time and time again.
    

        But if I'm right, and this turns out to be the beginning of an enduring trend, it will force us to rethink our long-standing assumptions about education and employment. If even a Ph.D. can't keep us safe from economic catastrophe, what will? That's the question that I find deeply unsettling, especially as we face the uncertainty and upheaval of the AI revolution. Yes, it's always been unfair that those who can afford to keep going to school face better prospects than their less-educated peers. But at least there was some kind of road map to financial security, a rule of thumb that told you how to get to higher ground. There was comfort in that predictability.
    

        Catey, the JD-Ph.D., counts himself among the lucky ones. While he continues his search for a full-time job, he's been able to land enough freelance work to get by. And he doesn't have to worry about paying off his student loans, because they were forgiven by the Biden administration. But being without a full-time job for almost a year wasn't exactly the life he envisioned back when he was slogging his way through grad school.
    

        ""Credentialing seemed to me a very solid way to make sure I had a reliable future of employment in front of me,"" he says. ""That's not how it turned out.""

We buy dash cams and hope we never really need to use them, which is what makes deals on them so appealing. These devices can come in clutch if you’re in an accident or some other situation in which you need to prove what was happening. Right now, Walmart has a Nexpow model for just $30, which is down from its retail price of $119. This is a flash deal, so it only lasts as long as the stock.
Nexpow
This dash cam setup actually includes two cameras, one for the front of the vehicle and one for the back. That way, you have much more coverage if something happens when you’re on the road. The front camera captures 1080p HD footage, while the back camera records at 720p. Both are equipped with wide-angle lenses, so they provide an almost comprehensive view of your surroundings.
The camera is simple enough to install on your own, so you don’t have to pay a shop to put it in place. Footage is saved to a microSD card, and this setup can even monitor your car when it’s parked using 24-hour parking mode. This isn’t a super high-end model, but it’s great for adding an extra layer of security to your daily commute. It’s especially great for drivers who are just starting out and need the extra security.

[+] smartphone screen in front of a stock chart showcasing Block Inc.'s financial performance, core businesses in digital payments, financial technology, cryptocurrency, and blockchain innovation, as well as broader trends in the fintech and stock market industries on February 16, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo by Cheng Xin/Getty Images)
Block Inc. (NYSE: XYZ) recently released its Q4 results, reporting earnings of $0.71 per share on sales of $6.03 billion, compared to consensus estimates of $0.87 per share and $6.29 billion in sales.
Block, formerly known as Square, is a fintech company that provides digital payments, point-of-sale hardware and software, along with other technology-driven financial services. From payment processing to loans and banking, Block now offers an expanded range of financial products. Furthermore, Block facilitates bitcoin trading by purchasing the cryptocurrency from private dealers and selling it to users at a modest markup.

Block stock, which has returned -12% since the beginning of 2024, has underperformed the S&P 500 index, which is up 28%. A tepid growth in gross payment volume and monthly active users did not satisfy investors and adversely affected its stock performance over the past year. If you are seeking an upside with a steadier ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and achieved returns of over 91% since its inception.
Block’s revenue of $6.03 billion in Q4 demonstrated a 4.5% year-over-year increase. In terms of revenue segments, transaction revenue increased 5.1% to $1.7 billion, while subscription and services revenue experienced the strongest gains, rising 16.8% to $1.9 billion. Hardware revenue declined 4.3% to $31 million, and Bitcoin-related revenue decreased 3.7% to $2.4 billion. Key performance indicators for Block showed strong results, with gross payment volume reaching $61.95 billion—a 7.8% increase year-over-year. EBITDA also exceeded expectations, coming in at $757 million, up 34.7% from the previous year. Both GPV and EBITDA figures surpassed street estimates of $61.3 billion and $740 million, respectively.
In Q4, Block’s profitability surged, as adjusted operating margins climbed to 17%, marking an 800 basis point improvement over the prior year. Earnings per share increased by 51% to $0.71. The company’s guidance suggests continued growth, with Q1 gross profit anticipated to rise by 11% to $2.32 billion at a 19% operating margin, and 2025 forecasts projecting $10.22 billion in gross profit with 21% operating margins.
Block’s shares dropped 18% following the release of its Q4 results. However, such volatility is not unusual for Block stock. Over a slightly longer timeframe, XYZ stock has consistently underperformed the broader market, with returns of -26% in 2021, -61% in 2022, 23% in 2023, and 10% in 2024.
In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, which comprises 30 stocks, is notably less volatile. It has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered better returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index, offering a less turbulent ride, as evidenced by the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment, characterized by rate cuts and multiple conflicts, could XYZ face a similar scenario as in the past four years and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months—or will it experience a recovery?
At its current level of around $70, Block stock carries a price-to-sales ratio of 1.8x, which is below its four-year average of 2.8x. Although the recent results were disappointing, we believe that Block stock’s current valuation adequately reflects the challenges posed by increased competition and the company’s recent performance. We think that the current valuation provides an attractive entry point for robust long-term gains.
While Block stock appears to have growth potential, it is useful to compare its performance with that of its peers on key metrics. You can find additional valuable comparisons for companies across various industries at Peer Comparisons.

Inflation fears have subsided, but not extinguished. If anything, Trump’s bold moves on tariffs and immigration have stoked fears of an inflation restart. All of this means the US economy could hit a rough spot, and even worse, hit a recession - our analysis here on the macro picture and below we describe what it could mean for Nvidia.
When you factor in a higher geopolitical uncertainty due to bold moves from the new Trump administration - these are critical risks. After all, trade is uncertain, and everyone - including Canada, Mexico, and Europe - longtime allies are now called to the negotiating table.
NVDA stock has fared worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during the last 3 economic downturns. Inflation Shock (Jan 2022 to May 2023)
• NVDA stock fell 66% from a high of $33 on 19 November 2021 to $11 on 14 October 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25% for the S&P 500
  • The stock fully recovered to its pre-inflation shock peak by 25 May 2023 - taking 154 days to recover while the S&P 500 took 317 days
  • Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $149.43 on 6 January 2025 and currently trades at around $135.
Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock like NVIDIA, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception.
• NVDA stock fell 37.6% from a high of $7.83 on 19 February 2020 to $4.89 on 16 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500
  • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Covid peak by 11 May 2020 - taking 56 days to recover while the S&P 500 took 148 days.
• During the 2007-09 recession, NVDA stock fell from a peak value of $0.91 on 17 October 2007 to $0.14 on 20 November 2008 a decline of 85.1% (vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500)
  • However, the stock fully recovered to its pre-recession peak by 27 April 2016 - taking 2715 days to recoup its losses vs. the 1480 days taken by the S&P 500 to recover.

51,2025-02-24,"The layoffs from Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) could be much bigger than many expect, according to a prominent economist, who warned about DOGE-led “growing” risks on the broader economy—and the markets, which President Donald Trump has always emphasized as a key barometer of his success.
Donald Trump, center, walks the New York Stock Exchange in December.
“We are starting to worry about the downside risks to the economy and markets,” Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management ($751 billion assets under management), wrote in a Saturday post.
Slok named the “the impact of DOGE layoffs and contract cuts” as his primary concern.
The DOGE-related layoffs could number 1 million, according to Slok, who noted the oft-cited roughly 300,000 potential layoffs does not account for the impact to the 5.2 million-person federal contractor workforce as Musk and President Donald Trump simultaneously take aim at government contracts and grants.
Slok, who predicted a rise in the unemployment rate tied to the government job cuts, concluded his note: “The near-term downside risks to the economy and markets are growing.”
66.5%. That’s the proportion of contract workers comprising the broader federal workforce which includes civil, military and postal workers, according to Brookings Institution analysis of data from 2023’s fiscal year. In 2002, contractors made up only 50.7% of the federal workforce.
More than 75,000 federal government employees voluntarily took a buyout, while layoffs that could affect up to 220,000 probationary workers have been carried out at agencies including the Internal Revenue Service and the Forest Service. Those layoffs are historically abnormal dating back to World War II, mirroring only what Bill Clinton did in shrinking Washington’s footprint. The economy is broadly strong, as unemployment was 4% in January and economic output grew at 2.3% during 2024’s fourth quarter, both in-line with historic norms. The largest amount of spending on federal contractors are at defense companies Lockheed Martin, RTX and General Dynamics, according to the System for Award Management, though non-defense firms including Dell, Deloitte, Microsoft and Pfizer also secured more than $1 billion in government contracts in 2023.
Steve Cohen, the billionaire founder of Point72 Asset Management, warned Friday about the prospect for a ""significant correction” in the stock market, citing pessimism about Trump’s economic policies including strict immigration, tariffs and DOGE’s cost-cutting. Less federal spending “has got to be negative for the economy,” said Cohen.
The stock market has continued its strong two-year stretch since Trump won a second term, as the benchmark S&P 500 is up 3.6% since Election Day. Trump quickly took credit for the initial boost from his victory, ringing the opening bell of the New York Stock Exchange and boasting last month: “Since my election the stock market has set records. The S&P 500 index has broken above 6,000 points for the first time ever, not even close” (the index came within 2% of 6,000 the week before the election). But the S&P has actually declined since Trump took office last month, dropping about 0.3% Monday after sinking nearly 2% Friday as Wall Street turns risk averse. Though the president has less impact on stock market returns than Trump may suggest, how stocks perform loosely leads public perception of the president. Trump has a history of abandoning policies after sharply negative stock market reactions, most recently delaying tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports after the S&P fell nearly 3% the day before the duties were set to go into effect. Unemployment rates are also important to Trump, who touted having “the best unemployment rates ever” ahead of the COVID-19 pandemic, which sent the jobless rate to a record 15%.
Higher unemployment tied to DOGE layoffs and potentially slower GDP growth tied to less government stimulus are not positives for financial markets, but that may be short-term pain before assets enjoy a prolonged bump from a more sustainable fiscal outlook, according to Morgan Stanley’s chief U.S. equity strategist Michael Wilson. DOGE’s efforts will temporarily hurt economic growth before sustainably lifting the economy, as the private sector grows and a healthier fiscal environment supports lower interest rates, Wilson wrote in a Monday note to clients. The $36.2 trillion national debt is double what it was in 2015 as yields for long-dated U.S. government bonds, a signal of wobbling investor faith in the sustainability of federal finances, have surged.

    Rates as high as 4.65% APY won't stick around forever.
  
If you're looking for a safe place to park your cash, a certificate of deposit can be a great solution. Unlike savings accounts, where rates can vary at any time, CD rates are fixed when you open the account. That means you'll earn the same amount of interest regardless of where overall rates go.
Today's best CDs boast up to 4.65% annual percentage yield, as well as other perks like low minimum deposit requirements and federal deposit insurance. Read on to see some of the highest CD rates available now and how much you could earn by depositing $5,000.
Experts recommend comparing rates before opening a CD account to get the best APY possible. Enter your information below to get CNET's partners' best rate for your area.
A CD can be a great place to stash your cash at any time, but in periods of inflation like today's, they can be especially lucrative. As the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to fight inflation, banks tend to follow suit, raising APYs on consumer products like CDs and savings accounts.
If you open a CD while rates remain elevated, you can continue to enjoy the same high returns even when rates begin to fall because your APY is locked in when you open a CD.
But don't wait too long to take advantage of today's APYs. While the Fed chose to pause rates at its January meeting, experts expect it to cut rates later this year, which means the clock is ticking.

Unity Software (NYSE: U) recently announced its Q4 results, reporting a loss of $0.30 per share on $457 million in sales, against consensus estimates of a $0.37 loss per share and $434 million in sales.
Unity's platform allows developers to create real-time 3D experiences. The company offers AI-enhanced tools that empower creators to develop and scale interactive 2D and 3D content across multiple devices.

Even though its Q1 guidance was below expectations, Unity shares surged 30% to $28 following the announcement of its migration to Vector – a new AI-powered advertising network that boosted investor confidence.
Unity stock has posted a -32% return since early 2024, underperforming the S&P 500 index, which has risen by 28%. A contentious pricing change attempt last year, along with slowing revenue growth, has adversely affected the company’s stock performance. For those seeking an upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and delivered over 91% returns since inception.
How Did Unity Perform in Q4?
Unity Software’s revenue in Q4 reached $457 million, marking a 25% year-over-year decline. In its segments, Create Solutions sales fell sharply by 47% to $152 million. This drop is partly due to a challenging year-over-year comparison, as the previous Q4 included $99 million from the termination of the Wētā FX agreement. Additionally, the Grow Solutions segment experienced a 5% decline in sales, falling to $305 million.
In Q4, Unity's adjusted EBITDA margin decreased by 700 basis points year-over-year, reaching 23%. This margin was superior to the company's expectations, thanks to its cost-control initiatives. The loss per share improved to $0.30, compared to a $0.66 loss per share in the corresponding quarter last year. Looking ahead, the company anticipates near-term challenges, expecting Q1 sales of $410 million, which is below both the consensus estimate of $430 million and the $460 million reported in the previous year's quarter.
What Does This Mean for Unity Stock?
Following the Q4 results announcement, Unity shares surged by 30%. Nonetheless, such volatility is typical for Unity stock. Over a longer period, the performance of U stock has been highly inconsistent, with annual returns exhibiting far greater volatility than those of the S&P 500. The stock's annual returns were -7% in 2021, -80% in 2022, 43% in 2023, and -45% in 2024.
In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, exhibits significantly lower volatility. It has also consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why is that? Collectively, the HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index, resulting in a smoother performance trajectory, as demonstrated by the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
Considering the current uncertain macroeconomic landscape, marked by potential rate cuts and ongoing conflicts, might Unity stock experience a scenario similar to that of 2021, 2022, and 2024, thereby underperforming the S&P over the next 12 months—or could it rebound? From a valuation standpoint, Unity stock seems to be fairly priced at present.
Trading at $28, Unity stock exhibits a price-to-sales ratio of 6x, which is in line with its three-year historical average. Although recent results were positive, the subdued guidance dampens enthusiasm. Nonetheless, the transition to Vector—its AI-powered platform—offers potential for future revenue growth through improved ad targeting. Considering these mixed factors and the stock trading at its historical valuation multiple, it appears that the current price accurately reflects Unity's value.
Although Unity stock appears to be fairly valued, it is useful to examine how Unity Software’s Peers perform on key metrics. Additional valuable comparisons across various industries can be found at Peer Comparisons.

55,2025-02-24,"Microsoft (MSFT-1.57%) shares fell slightly on Monday following an analyst report that the company canceled some U.S. data center leases, potentially signaling an oversupply of AI infrastructure.
On Friday, analysts at TD Cowen (TD-0.36%) said in a note that the tech giant had canceled leases worth “a couple of hundred megawatts,” or approximately two data centers worth of capacity. In some cases, Microsoft said “facility/power delays” were a reason for termination, analysts said in the note, adding that Meta (META-1.98%) had previously used a similar justification to cancel data center leases.
TD Cowen also noted that Microsoft “has pulled back on” converting statement of qualification, agreements that typically turn into traditional leases. The analysts expressed uncertainty about whether Microsoft’s actions represent a temporary delay or a complete termination of the agreements.
The company is potentially “in an oversupply position,” with the note adding that Microsoft has turned down other data center and land acquisition deals. The TD Cowen analysts wrote that this indicated “the loss of a major demand signal that Microsoft was originally responding to and that we believed the shift in their appetite for capacity is tied to OpenAI.”
The company’s stock was down by around 1.2% at noon and has fallen by more than 4% so far this year. 
“Thanks to the significant investments we have made up to this point, we are well positioned to meet our current and increasing customer demand,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement shared with Quartz, declining to address the note directly. “Last year alone, we added more capacity than any prior year in history. While we may strategically pace or adjust our infrastructure in some areas, we will continue to grow strongly in all regions. This allows us to invest and allocate resources to growth areas for our future.”
The spokesperson added that Microsoft’s plan to spend more than $80 billion on AI infrastructure this fiscal year is still on track.
Last week, The Information reported that OpenAI has told investors that it expects the Stargate Project — which it has partnered with SoftBank (SFTBY-3.83%) and Oracle (ORCL-4.19%) on — to provide three-quarters of the computing power it needs for its artificial intelligence models by the end of the decade — a shift away from Microsoft.
Bank of America (BAC+0.20%) analysts said in a note on Monday that Microsoft is “strongly refuting” changes to its data center strategy.
“They [Microsoft] make investments based on a 10-year view on demand for cloud and AI demand,” the Bank of America analysts said. “They tweak their forecasts up and down on this overtime on a regional basis depending on which regions need to be prioritized.”

56,2025-02-24,"Palantir (PLTR-5.01%) (PLRTR) extended its decline on Monday morning following last week’s plunge that was driven by a new share sales initiative by the CEO and a media report of potential U.S. defense budget cuts. The stock is now about 30% down from its 2025 peak earlier this month.
Defense-spending cuts could weigh heavily on Palantir, which reported a 45% increase in revenue from the U.S. government in the fourth quarter. Overall revenue was $828 million — a 36% jump year over year and a 14% increase from the previous quarter. 
Even after the recent selloff, the stock is still up almost 300% over 12 months and trading at about 490 for its historic earnings and about 190 for its projected future earnings. By comparison, companies in the Nasdaq Composite Index are trading at an average price-to-earnings ratio of just under 42, more than a third higher than the historical average for the index.
“Revenues and net income have been increasing quarter after quarter — but not by the rate at which its stock is growing,” Michael Rechenthin, head of R&D at Tastylive, a streaming platform geared toward options traders, said earlier this month, before the selloff.
Palantir’s U.S. government business had a pronounced revenue deceleration in 2021 and 2022. “There is high risk of this happening again,” which would probably result in a valuation multiple contraction, according to William Blair analysts cited by Barron’s.
Even without major bad news, the stock had been trading at extraordinary levels, and the rally was set to peter out as investors got exhausted, Explosive Options founder Bob Lang said before the stock plunge. “The stock’s not made of Teflon,” he said earlier in February.

58,2025-02-24,"While trying to get its Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card more solidly on the market, the component manufacturer and its retail partners have bumped into some functionality issues with the GPU that affect its performance.
Several users have obtained the RTX 5090 GPU from multiple different retailers, and have reported a unique problem, where the GPU does not have as many ROPs (Raster Operations Pipeline unit) as it should to sufficiently render images in 3D post-processing.
A member of the TechPowerUp forums reported that their graphics card, GeForce RTX 5090 GPU supplied by the retailer Zotac was registering as having fewer ROPs than it should. The member attempted to remedy the issue with software re-installs and switching the video BIOS, which was no help. Ultimately, this
Upon further analysis, on a Zotac brand RTX 5090 GPU of their own, TechPowerUp observed that the component has 168 ROPs instead of the customary 176 ROPs. The 8 ROP difference can equate to a 4.5% difference in GPU performance; however, the publication observed performance losses of over 5% when performing benchmarks with the compromised graphics cards.
With the problem affecting not only, Zotac brand, but also ASUS, Gigabyte, MSI, Palit, and NVIDIA GPUs, enthusiasts have determined that this is a hardware issue more than a software challenge.
Nvidia has acknowledged the reports of performance issues with the RTX 5090 GPU, indicating that only a small number of graphics cards have been affected. The component company has also made it known that the GeForce RTX 5090D, a chip localized to the Chinese market, and GeForce RTX 5070 Ti have also been affected.
We have identified a rare issue affecting less than 0.5% (half a percent) of GeForce RTX 5090 / 5090D and 5070 Ti GPUs which have one fewer ROP than specified. The average graphical performance impact is 4%, with no impact on AI and Compute workloads. Affected consumers can contact the board manufacturer for a replacement. The production anomaly has been corrected.
– Nvidia
YouTuber JayzTwoCents noted anyone concerned about the performance efficacy of their RTX 5090 can download TechPowerup’s GPU Information Utility here, or by searching for TechPowerup GPU-Z. Download the utility from the servers. Once it pops up, it will tell you everything you need to know about your GPU. For this instance, the ROPs section should read 176 for a healthy card. Anything less, such as 168 ROPs may indicate a problem.
For preliminary assistance, the YouTuber recommends not returning the defective GPU, as it may just end up in circulation with another consumer– and you may end up having to wait for an extended time for a new GPU.
He suggests reaching out to the customer service account of the vendor from which you purchased the card, using a headline such as ‘Missing ROPs, response required,’ and remembering to be kind, as there are likely many people reaching out with similar concerns at this time.
Nvidia has wrapped up support for the 32-bit PhysX graphics technology. The brand has quietly removed the legacy SDK out of rotation, much to the chagrin of fans who still play the games that require the functionality.
Nvidia confirmed the end-of-life status of the GPU-accelerated physics simulation SDK, which was known for cloth simulation, shattering glass, moving liquids, and several other particle effects. PhysX is endearingly associated with AAA gaming titles including the Batman Arkham trilogy, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, Borderlands 2, Metro: Last Light, Metro: Exodus, Metro 2033, Mirror's Edge, The Witcher 3, and certain older Assassin's Creed titles.
There have been many varied reports about the fate of Nvidia’s 2025 GPUs. One day they are in dire delays and shortages. The next day they have been confirmed for release. Today, specific graphics cards have been aligned with an upcoming laptop.
A report from VideoCards has gotten hold of a specification list from HP, which indicates that its Victus 15 laptop will support the GeForce RTX 5050 and GeForce RTX 5060 GPU options.
The disappointing ""paper launch"" continues. Nvidia's RTX 5070 Ti is just a couple of days away from launch, but whether it'll actually be readily available is another thing entirely. Although it could rival some of the best graphics cards, the GPU is said to be hard to come by, much like the RTX 5090 and the RTX 5080.
It appears that my worries might be about to come true -- the RTX 5070 Ti will only be available on paper and not in reality, at least if this new leak is to be believed. Channel Gate shared an update on the predicted pricing and stock levels for the RTX 5070 Ti, and it's grim news all around.

Staying ahead of emerging technology is an exciting challenge. To do so, you need to keep your finger on the pulse of the latest innovations. If technology excites you, you know that 2025 will bring both refinements to existing tools and groundbreaking new developments poised for a major market debut.
We are witnessing a wave of advancements, many arriving just as people are getting accustomed to recent breakthroughs. Take ChatGPT, for instance. It’s hard to believe it has already been around for two years. While early adopters are eagerly anticipating new upgrades, others are only beginning to explore its potential.
Technology is integrating into human life at an unprecedented pace—faster than even some of the greatest minds anticipated. To fully grasp the benefits, particularly of AI, the best approach is to learn and adapt. To help you stay informed, I’m pulling back the curtain on three key AI trends set to shape the tech landscape in 2025:
Navigating the AI landscape can be both thrilling and overwhelming. Where do you start? Which tool is the most effective?
Fortunately, two Berkeley students have made this easier. What began as a graduate project has now evolved into Chatbot Arena, the world’s most-watched AI ranking platform.
Chatbot Arena ranks AI systems from companies like OpenAI and Google based on user votes. The concept is simple: You enter a query, receive responses from two anonymous AI models and vote for the one you prefer. The winning AI earns a point.
This ranking system has caught the attention of tech executives and engineers, who monitor it much like Wall Street tracks the stock market. By evaluating AI performance in real time, Chatbot Arena helps users identify the most effective models. As AI continues to evolve, tools like this will be invaluable in determining which systems best serve our needs.
Most AI models today rely on short thinking, or what psychologist Daniel Kahneman describes as System 1—fast, intuitive responses. ChatGPT is a prime example, delivering quick and detailed answers to prompts.
However, a new generation of AI is emerging that prioritizes long thinking—akin to System 2, which involves deeper reasoning and problem-solving. These advanced models will be capable of thinking through complex questions more thoroughly, providing more reliable and nuanced answers.
One major challenge in AI development is identifying what information models don’t have—what questions they can’t answer. However, once these knowledge gaps are successfully bridged, AI will reach an entirely new level of capability.
Large language models (LLMs) have transformed human-computer interaction, but they’re not new—LLM research dates back to the 1950s. Recent breakthroughs, however, have dramatically accelerated their capabilities.
Today’s LLMs can integrate direct human feedback into their training, continuously improving their accuracy and performance. These models process vast amounts of text data, generating responses that often feel indistinguishable from human speech.
LLMs fall under the broader category of generative AI, which is reshaping multiple industries. Beyond text generation, we’re seeing rapid advancements in AI-driven image, audio and video creation. In 2025, expect to see an even greater expansion of LLM applications. If you're interested in learning more, Databricks offers a comprehensive guide on LLMs.
Understanding AI will soon become less of a choice and more of a necessity. Just as Siri, Alexa and other AI-powered tools have seamlessly integrated into our daily lives, new AI innovations will do the same—whether we realize it or not.
AI is far from a passing trend. What began as a novel concept has evolved into a technological revolution that’s still in its infancy. We’ll be discussing AI for decades to come, and those who embrace it early will have a distinct advantage.

61,2025-02-24,"While in Italy, I wanted to experience the country's finest food, art, and architecture while doing my best to avoid crowds. I was very successful at doing this in Bologna.
First of all, I appreciate that the city is far less visited than some of Italy's most popular destinations. Last year, Bologna welcomed millions fewer visitors than Florence and over 20 million fewer than Rome.
The walkable Northern Italian city also won me over with its beautiful rose- and rust-colored buildings that blend in with the hues of a sunset.
Though Bologna's relatively fewer tourists make it an appealing travel destination, that's just one of many reasons to plan a trip here.
Bologna is affectionately nicknamed La Grassa, which translates to ""the fat"" and reflects what the city is best known for: its amazing cuisine.
In fact, Bologna and the surrounding Emilia-Romagna region are the original home to many famous Italian foods such as Parmigiano Reggiano, tagliatelle al ragù, balsamic vinegar, tortellini, and mortadella.
One way to explore the local cuisine is by taking a food tour — though it's not necessary. I took a spontaneous approach, dining at restaurants ranging from destination spots with the best reviews to smaller, lesser-known ones that I stumbled upon during my trip.
No matter where I ate in Bologna, I had a cozy, authentically Italian-feeling experience. I didn't feel as if I encountered dining tourist traps, which wasn't the case in Florence.
A culinary highlight of the trip was the fresh handmade pasta I ate at Sfoglia Rina, a cozy trattoria with a long tradition of producing and serving handmade pasta since its inception in 1963.
Lastly, I highly suggest taking a stroll in the medieval streets of Quadrilatero, Bologna's ancient market. It's the perfect place for a culinary adventure with its fresh produce and street food.
If you appreciate beautiful architecture and are an aesthete, Bologna should be a must-visit city. It's also pedestrian-friendly, so pack your comfiest walking shoes and get ready to explore.
Start at the Piazza Maggiore, the city's central square, and check out one of its most important buildings, the Basilica di San Petronio. Then, stop by and marvel at the Neptune Fountain in Piazza del Nettuno, just a short distance away.
Enjoy walking below Bologna's porticoes, which have been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The covered walkways are said to be a symbol of Bologna's hospitality and sociability, offering visitors shelter in all seasons.
The Archiginnasio, which dates back to the 16th century, is another must-visit place in Bologna. It houses a centuries-old municipal library and a theater hall that was once used for anatomical displays and lectures.
You could easily spend a few days here, leisurely taking in its old-world charms. While in the area, you can check out other nearby towns in the Emilia-Romagna region, like Modena or Parma.
This year, Bologna may be an especially attractive city to include in your Italian itinerary if you want to dodge the millions of pilgrims expected to congregate in Rome for the Jubilee.
Once you feel you are ready to brave more hordes of tourists, though, take advantage of the city's location and the fact that it is one of the main railway hubs in Italy.
By train, Bologna is less than an hour from Florence, about two hours from Rome, and an hour and a half from Venice.

62,2025-02-24,"I know several people who honeymooned on the French Polynesia islands, and their photos looked marvelous. 
The islands seem great for couples — US News even named two of them (Bora Bora and Tahiti) as some of the best spots for newlyweds in 2025.
However, I wanted to see if Polynesia is also a worthwhile destination for a solo trip.
Here's how I spent a week island-hopping around Polynesia all by myself.
To kick off my trip, I flew Air Tahiti Nui to the largest island in French Polynesia, Tahiti.
I landed early in the morning, and my room at Te Moana Tahiti Resort wasn't ready yet. 
So, I started exploring the area right away. There were yellow mopeds in front of the hotel that I could rent by downloading an app on my phone. 
I named my scooter Lemondrop and spent the entire day with her.
The first stop was grabbing a bite to eat at Snack De Mairipehe — which ended up being one of the best meals I've ever had.
It was my first time trying poisson cru, a delicious dish that consists of raw fish marinated in citrus juice and coconut milk alongside cucumbers, tomatoes, and avocados.
At the restaurant, a local told me about Tahiti Iti, a reef break that offers some of the best surfing in the Pacific Ocean. Of course, I had to see for myself.
I rode over, and when I arrived, I saw some people about to leave the shore on a small boat. I asked if I could join, paid a small fee, and found myself on a 30-minute tour to the break to see the surfers up close.
It was one of the coolest travel experiences I've ever had.
I also stopped to see the Arahoho Blowhole and the Plage Ahonu black-sand beach before heading back to my hotel.
The next day, I strolled through the island's popular Marche de Papeete market, where I sampled several local foods.
I also took a wrong turn and ended up on a neighborhood street closed off for an outdoor game of bingo. The locals encouraged me to join, and I won on my first try.
The unplanned moment remains one of my favorite memories from the trip — it gave me a warm glimpse into the local culture.
The next leg of my trip was on Raiatea, which was only a 45-minute flight away. It's considered a sacred island in Polynesian spirituality and home to the Marae Taputapuātea UNESCO World Heritage Site.
I stayed in a mother-daughter-run bed and breakfast called Niu Shack. My room was in a hut in the jungle, and the mother cooked all my meals with fresh fruits from her extensive garden.
Beyond the stunning accommodations, the highlight was trying my hand at sailing on a double-hulled Holopuni canoe.
Next, I visited one of the most remote archipelagos in the world, the Marquesas Islands.
I had to get back to Tahiti, and then it was a three-hour flight to Nuka Hiva, the largest of the islands.
I loved staying with a local family in Pension Tokaeva guesthouse. It was fascinating to slow down and converse with the family — thank you, Google Translate — and learn more about their lives and culture.
For the final leg of my journey, I flew to Hiva Oa, the second largest of the Marquesas Islands. I rented a car — which was an interesting adventure itself — and visited the Paul Gauguin Cultural Center to learn more about the French artist.
The most memorable part of my time on the island, however, was traversing the lush, mountainous cliffside in search of local tiki makers.
I ended up purchasing two tikis, one stone and one wooden, from two different villages an hour away from each other.
I was worried the Polynesian islands would be full of loved-up newlyweds — and that many of the local attractions would be catered to them. Luckily, that wasn't my experience.
I had a fabulous time exploring a few of the islands by myself and was able to connect with locals along the way.
I could see why someone would want to celebrate love in a place like Tahiti, but I'd be excited to come back with or without a partner.

64,2025-02-24,"A new report suggests OpenAI could shift its computational needs from Microsoft to SoftBank in the future. 

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Last month, OpenAI announced a $500 billion commitment to its Stargate project, designed to facilitate the construction of data centers across the United States for its sophisticated advances. This directly impacted its multi-billion partnership with Microsoft, losing its exclusive cloud provider status.
While Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI has seemingly become more complicated, it holds the “right of first refusal.” As such, Microsoft remains the first option to host OpenAI workloads in its cloud infrastructure and services. The services will only be outsourced to other vendors if Microsoft can't meet the requirements.
However, a new report by The Information suggests a rift forming between Microsoft and OpenAI, further indicating that the latter may be drifting away from Microsoft and leaning more on SoftBank for its computing needs.
As you may know, OpenAI's $500 billion bet on Stargate is based on private investments from OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle, and MGX, with SoftBank having the largest stake in the project.
The Information's report details that OpenAI's drift from Microsoft won't happen overnight. Instead, OpenAI's dependency on Microsoft's data centers for computing power is likely to get more intense as its advances in AI become more sophisticated.
Per the outlet's estimations, the ChatGPT maker's overall costs will assume a dramatic uptick, with projections of up to $20 billion in cash by 2027. As you may know, OpenAI was on the verge of bankruptcy, with projections of making a $5 billion loss within 12 months.

However, the AI firm was saved from the cusps of bankruptcy through a round of funding. Key investors, including Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Thrive Capital, raised $6.6 billion, pushing the company's market valuation well beyond $157 billion.
All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.
OpenAI is reportedly in talks to raise $40 billion through another round of funding, pushing its market capitalization to approximately $340 billion.
SoftBank is slated to lead the funding round with a stake of between $15 billion and $25 billion in the ChatGPT maker. Interestingly, this would dethrone Microsoft as OpenAI's largest investor, passing on the crown to SoftBank.
Elsewhere, OpenAI co-founder and Tesla CEO Elon Musk jokingly offered to acquire OpenAI for $97.4 billion, seemingly opening Pandora's box and leading to a back-and-forth with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Interestingly, Musk's acquisition offer was well beyond OpenAI's market value, potentially indicating that he wasn't serious about his offer.
Altman quickly rubbished Musk's offer, indicating OpenAI wasn't on sale, neither was its mission. The executive brushed off Musk's offer as one of his usual gambits. “I wish he would just compete by building a better product,"" added Altman.
Following OpenAI's Stargate announcement, there have been a lot of predictions about its partnership's trajectory with Microsoft. For instance, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff suggests that Microsoft won't use OpenAI's technology across its tech stack in the future. It'll be interesting to see how things unfold as the AI bubble turns into a tangled web.

65,2025-02-24,"These five undervalued stocks represent diverse opportunities across multiple sectors, each with ... [+] strong fundamentals and catalysts that could drive share price appreciation.
The stock market's volatility in early 2025 has created compelling opportunities for value investors willing to look beyond the headlines. While many investors remain fixated on high-flying tech stocks and the latest AI developments, several quality companies are trading at attractive valuations despite having strong fundamentals and promising growth prospects.
This analysis identifies five stocks that appear significantly undervalued based on multiple metrics, including price-to-earnings ratios, price-to-book values, and discounted cash flow models. Each company featured demonstrates solid financial health, competitive advantages in their respective industries and catalysts that could drive share price appreciation in the coming months.
This selection process focused on companies with market capitalizations above $10 billion to ensure adequate liquidity and financial stability. I screened for stocks trading at least 20% below their intrinsic value estimates, calculated using a combination of discounted cash flow analysis and relative valuation metrics. Each company was evaluated based on its competitive position, financial strength and potential catalysts that could drive price appreciation.
Additional criteria included debt-to-equity ratios below industry averages, positive free cash flow generation, and demonstrated ability to maintain or grow market share in their respective industries. I excluded companies facing significant regulatory challenges or structural industry headwinds that could impair their long-term business prospects.
Deere & Company is the global leader in manufacturing of agricultural, construction and forestry equipment. The company's innovative approach to precision agriculture and autonomous solutions has helped farmers increase productivity while reducing input costs. Despite near-term concerns about agricultural commodity prices, Deere's long-term position remains strong as global food demand rises and farmers increasingly adopt technology-enabled solutions.
Deere & Company (DE) position as a top pick is reinforced by its strategic pivot toward autonomous and precision agriculture technology, resulting in 8% growth in its recurring revenue streams from precision ag software subscriptions in Q4 2024. This transformation from a pure equipment manufacturer to a technology-enabled solutions provider has expanded profit margins while creating high switching costs for customers who adopt Deere's integrated precision farming platforms. The company's forward P/E ratio of 24 times earnings sits near its 5-year average, despite its strengthening competitive moat in autonomous farming equipment and a robust order backlog of nearly 10 billion dollars that extends well into 2026, suggesting a significant upside potential as the market gradually recognizes Deere's evolution from a cyclical equipment manufacturer to a more stable, technology-driven agricultural solutions provider.
Bristol Myers Squibb has established itself as a leading biopharmaceutical company with a strong oncology portfolio and a promising pipeline. Despite concerns about patent expirations for key drugs, the company has demonstrated the ability to develop and commercialize new treatments successfully. Their recent strategic acquisitions have strengthened their pipeline and diversified their revenue streams.
BMY's compelling value proposition stems from the market's overly pessimistic view of its patent cliff concerns, overlooking its proven ability to refresh its product portfolio through internal development and strategic acquisitions. The recent approval of Opdivo Qvantig (a cancer drug) in 2024 demonstrates the company's R&D capabilities, while its strong cash position of 11 billion dollars provides ample resources for additional acquisitions or licensing deals to further strengthen its pipeline. Trading at just 9 times forward earnings, well below the pharmaceutical sector average of 16 times earnings, BMY offers an attractive entry point for investors.
FedEx continues to transform its operations through cost-cutting initiatives and network optimization efforts. The company's dominant position in express delivery and growing e-commerce capabilities provide sustainable competitive advantages. Recent restructuring efforts have improved operational efficiency and profit margins, while strategic investments in automation and technology enhance long-term growth prospects.
The market appears to be undervaluing FedEx's successful transformation efforts and improved profitability metrics. The company's DRIVE program has already delivered significant cost savings, with additional improvements expected in the coming years. The growing adoption of e-commerce and the increasing need for reliable logistics services provide structural tailwinds for FedEx's business.
The company's strong brand, global network and improving capital allocation strategy position it well for long-term growth. With shares trading at a discount to historical valuations and peers, FedEx offers an attractive combination of value and growth potential.
EOG Resources is one of North America's most efficient oil and gas producers. The company's premium drilling strategy, focusing on low-cost, high-return locations, has consistently delivered superior returns on capital employed. EOG's technological advantages in drilling and completion techniques provide sustainable competitive advantages in resource extraction.
EOG's current valuation doesn't fully reflect its superior operational efficiency and strong balance sheet. The company's focus on premium drilling locations and ability to generate free cash flow even at lower commodity prices provides significant downside protection. The growing global energy demand and potential supply constraints support stable long-term oil prices.
The company's disciplined capital allocation strategy, including a growing dividend and opportunistic share repurchases, demonstrates management's commitment to shareholder returns. EOG's technological leadership and premium asset base position it well for sustainable long-term growth.
Micron Technology is a leading global memory and storage solutions producer, including DRAM and NAND flash products. The company's advanced manufacturing capabilities and technology leadership position it well to benefit from the growing demand for memory solutions in AI, data centers and automotive applications. Recent investments in leading-edge production capacity strengthen its competitive position.
Micron Technology (MU)'s compelling investment case is built on its strengthening position in the high-growth AI memory market, where its HBM3E products have secured an 11% market share and commanded premium pricing due to limited competition in this specialized segment. The company's recent multi-billion investment in advanced manufacturing capabilities positions it to capture growing demand from AI applications. At 2.4 times book value, around its historical average, Micron offers significant upside potential as AI-driven demand accelerates and memory pricing recovers from the recent cyclical trough.
Bottom Line
These five undervalued stocks represent diverse opportunities across multiple sectors, each with strong fundamentals and catalysts that could drive share price appreciation. While near-term market volatility may persist, these companies’ competitive advantages, strong balance sheets, and attractive valuations provide a margin of safety for long-term investors. Regularly monitoring company-specific developments and broader market conditions remains essential, but these selections offer compelling risk-reward profiles at current levels. As always, investors should conduct their own due diligence and consider their individual investment objectives and risk tolerance before making investment decisions."

Too often, dividend investors just assume that companies have the cash flows needed pay their dividends.
Did you know:
The only way to know that a company can afford to pay its dividends is to measure its free cash flow (FCF). FCF must be equal to or greater than its dividend; otherwise, the company must raise capital or use cash reserves to pay its dividend. Or…the company has to suspend or cut its dividend.
In other words, FCF is important. There is no good excuse for not doing the diligence on FCF to be sure a company’s dividend is safe.
As my regular readers know, my firm’s research gives you the best insight into the safety of dividends. For example, in Figure 2 below, I directly compare the featured stock’s cash dividend payments to its free cash flow.
Today’s free stock pick provides a summary of how I pick stocks for the Safest Dividend Yields Model Portfolio. This summary is not a full Long Idea report, but it gives you insight into the rigor of my firm’s research and approach to picking stocks.
This Model Portfolio only includes stocks that earn an Attractive or Very Attractive rating, have positive free cash flow (FCF) and economic earnings, and offer a dividend yield greater than 3%. Companies with strong free cash flow provide higher quality and safer dividend yields because strong FCF supports the dividend.
Dine Brands Global Inc. (DIN) is the featured stock in January’s Safest Dividend Yields Model Portfolio.
Dine Brands has grown revenue and net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) by 1% and 2% compounded annually, respectively, since 2018. The company’s NOPAT margin improved from 19% in 2018 to 20% in the TTM, while invested capital turns rose from 0.3 to 0.4 over the same time. Rising NOPAT margins and invested capital turns drive the company’s return on invested capital (ROIC) from 6% in 2018 to 7% in the TTM.
Figure 1: Dine Brands’ Revenue & NOPAT Since 2018
DIN Revenue and NOPAT 2018 - TTM
Dine Brands has increased its regular dividend from $0.40/share in 4Q21 to $0.51/share in 4Q24. The current quarterly dividend, when annualized provides a 7.0% dividend yield.
The company’s free cash flow (FCF) easily exceeds its regular dividend payments. From 2019 through 3Q24, the company generated $1.3 billion (64% of current enterprise value) in FCF while paying $253 million in regular dividends. See Figure 2.
Figure 2: Dine Brands’ FCF Vs. Regular Dividends Since 2018
DIN Dividends and FCF 2018 - 3Q24
As Figure 2 shows, this company’s dividends are backed by a history of reliable cash flows. Dividends from companies with low or negative FCF are less dependable since the company would not be able to sustain paying dividends.
At its current price of $29/share, this stock has a price-to-economic book value (PEBV) ratio of 0.4. This ratio means the market expects the company’s NOPAT to permanently fall 60% from TTM levels. This expectation seems overly pessimistic given that the company has grown NOPAT 2% compounded annually over the last five years and 5% compounded annually over the past two decades.
Even if the company’s:
the stock would be worth $35/share today – a 21% upside. In this scenario, the company’s NOPAT would fall 3% compounded annually through 2033.
Should the company’s NOPAT grow more in line with historical growth rates, the stock has even more upside.
Below are specifics on the adjustments I make based on Robo-Analyst findings in this featured stock’s 10-K and 10-Qs:
Income Statement: I made over $120 million in adjustments with a net effect of removing over $70 million in non-operating expenses.
Balance Sheet: I made around $1.2 billion in adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net increase of just under $900 million. The most notable adjustment was for asset write downs.
Valuation: I made just under $1.9 billion in adjustments to shareholder value, with a net decrease of around $1.6 billion. Other than total debt, the most notable adjustment to shareholder value was for excess cash.

As Wall Street kicks off the final week of February 2025, investors are bracing for a busy week of data. I watch the news but I pay more attention to how the market reacts to the news. Remember, there are only three ways the market can move: up, down or sideways. A market that can’t fall on bearish news is bullish. The opposite is also true. Moreover, we all make (and or lose) money based on one thing: change in price. If the price moves in our favor (up if we are long and down if we are short) than we make money. If the price moves against us, we lose money. Everything else, including the latest headlines du jour comes second. For me, that’s why the reaction to the news matters more than the news itself. That doesn’t mean the news doesn’t matter, it does. The key is to focus on how the market reacts to the news and adjust accordingly. 
 First, let’s look at the day-to-day breakdown and some of the big events happening this week:
Monday, February 24: Earnings season keeps rolling with Domino’s Pizza (DPZ), Owens Corning (OC), and Zoom Communications (ZM) reporting. Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) is also on tap—could give us a read on industrial demand. No major economic data today, so the focus is on these corporate updates.
Tuesday, February 25: Big day—Home Depot (HD) reports, offering a window into consumer spending and housing trends. We’ve also got American Tower (AMT), Intuit (INTU), and Workday (WDAY). Plus, February Consumer Confidence drops—last month it hit a low, so any bounce could lift spirits.
Wednesday, February 26: Heavyweight day for tech and retail—Nvidia (NVDA), Salesforce (CRM), and Snowflake (SNOW) report, which could swing the Nasdaq. Lowe’s (LOW) and TJX (TJX) give us more consumer clues. January New Home Sales data lands too—watch for housing momentum.
Thursday, February 27: GDP second estimate for Q4 hits, alongside durable goods and pending home sales for January. On the earnings front, Dell (DELL), HP (HPQ), and Autodesk (ADSK) report—tech’s still in the spotlight. Royal Bank of Canada (RY) and TD Bank (TD) could signal financial sector health.
Friday, February 28: Is the last trading day in February. We wrap the week with January PCE price index—the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge—plus personal income and spending data. Earnings from Chart Industries (GTLS) and Alpha Metallurgical Resources (AMR) close out a busy earnings week. Markets will be digesting all this ahead of the weekend.
Political News:
 Second, let’s step back and look at the different news that we expect to hit the tape this week. First, we have the always fun political news. Investors will want to see the latest developments and what will happen with tariffs. Last month, Canada and Mexico managed to get a one month extension. Investors will want to see if they get another extension or if they can reach a deal to get rid of tariffs. In early February, U.S. stocks sold off after the tariffs were announced. We’ll see what happens in March.
Economic News:
 Next up we have a flurry of economic news. As mentioned above, on Tuesday we have the Consumer Confidence Index. That will offer a fresh perspective on household optimism, a critical driver of consumer spending. It is important to note that consumer spending makes up over 75% of the economy. That’s why focusing on the consumer is important to make sense of what the rest of 2025 will look like. 
 On Wednesday, Nvidia reports earnings and we will get more economic data. Nvidia is considered the big artificial intelligence darling on Wall Street. If it gaps up and rallies, that will bode well for other AI and tech stocks. On the other hand, if it rolls over and falls, that could put pressure on the market.
On the economic front, durable goods orders are going to be released. That could signal whether businesses are ramping up spending or cutting back. Thursday brings international news with preliminary inflation figures from major Eurozone economies: Germany, France, Italy, and Spain, among others. Inflation has been public enemy #1 for many global central banks so that will be important going forward. We also have the second estimate for U.S. GDP.
 In the U.S., we get a sneak peak at inflation on Friday when the Personal Consumption Expenditures data is announced. The PCE is one of the important metrics the Federal Reserve looks at each month. We will also get the personal income and spending figures; a hotter-than-expected PCE could cut hopes for near-term rate cuts, while slowing spending might hint at an economic slowdown. Together, these releases will test the narrative of a robust U.S. economy against lingering inflation risks, offering clues on whether stocks can sustain their lofty heights or face a reality check.
What It Means For Investors
 Investors will want to see who will win this week, the bulls or the bears. If we get a big up week, that means the bulls win. Conversely, if we roll over and see more selling pressure (a.k.a. distribution) show up, the bears will emerge victorious. 
 As February draws to a close, this week’s heavy data and earnings will test global markets. Bulls will point to resilient earnings and lower central-bank rates as fuel for further gains; bears will highlight inflation risks and policy uncertainty. By Friday’s close, we’ll have a clearer picture of what the rest of 2025 may look like. As always, it is never a dull moment on Wall Street.

Raspberry Pi as a basic computing machine is useful for a wide array of purposes, ranging from home automation and triggered inputs for gadgets, to computer science projects or advanced robotics. The modular utility of this inexpensive computer for IOT applications makes it a versatile choice for seamless hardware and software connectivity. The tiny single-board computing machine costing as low as $30 comes with USB ports, and no wonder it is the favorite play toy for DIY’ers who like to create unique things. VEEB Projects likes to tinker around with Raspberry Pi and 3D-printed creations for some cool DIYs like the Precision Turntable and a Super 8 Cyberdesk.
Their love for the affordable computer continues with this eye-popping DIY that brings a 150-year-old illusion to life on your desk. The project is centered around the Pepper’s Ghost illusion a classic optical illusion that creates the appearance of a ghostly figure or image that seems to float in mid-air, often used in theater, amusement parks, and museums to create hologram-like effects. This illusion was first put to the test in the 1860s by John Henry Pepper in a theater, and it’s still used today for creating holographic effects in many live shows and attractions.
Designer: VEEB Projects







Dubbed the Transparent Floating Display, this DIY gadget takes its design cues from the classic stock ticker tape machine invented in 1870 by Edward A. Calahan of the American Telegraph Company that was the standard when it came to transmitting stock price information over long distances before the inventions of computers. Used for the early half of the 20th century, these reliable tickers were in use until the early 1970s. Employing the complex play of reflections and light, the holographic dome projects a very clear image thanks to a reflector positioned at an angle of 45 degrees inside the housing. For better viewing when placed on a desk, the see-through floating display can be toggled to an angle of 60 degrees. At the base of the gadget is a small round LCD panel that is connected to the Raspberry Pi 5 having 16GB RAM. To make the source image visible from the LCD, a privacy shield is used.







According to the maker, it took a lot of tinkering and mathematics to get the assembly just right for the illusion to work hitch-free. VEEB employed the magic of algebra to sort the distortions for a clear transparent effect that looks mesmerizing in a geeky workstation setup. The round base of the dome is created using 3D printing to conceal all the hardware inside. One can also substitute a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 to recreate this effect. The makers are kind enough to keep the project open source as all the code and 3D models for the design are shared on GitHub. What would we put inside the dome of this steampunk desk gadget? Maybe a cool music equalizer visualization, To-do-list notes, vital notifications, or a virtual aquarium!

Every startup has a story. Regardless of the outcome, there's always something to be learned, something to be shared. Because here's the thing: the startup journey isn't linear. It's a roller coaster. You enter with an idea, only to hit dead ends, take wrong turns, and double back. It's messy, frustrating, and often humbling. But when you finally reach the other side, you see how every twist and turn shaped your company and your perspective.
BYBE didn't scale to become a unicorn, go public, or—to be honest—change the world. But it did revolutionize a specific, narrow use case in the alcohol industry. We exited and returned money to our investors. And along the way, we experienced the kind of challenges, breakthroughs, and lessons that only a startup can offer.
With this article, my goal is simple: take the startup truisms we've all heard—the ones in books, blogs, or Youtube—and apply them to my journey as a founder and CEO, from ideation to exit and everything in between.
When I first started BYBE, the two most common questions I got were:
And while the second question usually came with a good laugh or eye roll, the first one deserves a deeper answer. Because the story of BYBE starts not with a lightbulb moment, but with a series of insights that fit together like puzzle pieces.
Before BYBE, I worked for a beer and wine distributor, calling on Kroger. It was a role that gave me a front-row seat to the complexities of the alcohol industry—particularly the maze of regulations that governed how products were marketed and sold.
One day, a regulatory issue caught me by surprise. Why couldn't retailers offer their own discounts on alcohol products? Why did alcohol brands seem entirely absent from the coupon sections of retail loyalty programs and mobile apps? My curiosity took over, and I dove headfirst into the legal frameworks that shaped the industry. What I found was a web of outdated rules—rules that constrained innovation and left a glaring gap in how alcohol brands connected with consumers in a digital-first world.
Then, I took a trip to California. What struck me immediately was how the rules there were completely different. Discounts and promotions that were impossible in one state were routine in another. The realization was eye-opening: the alcohol industry wasn't just regulated—it was fragmented, with each state operating independently.
That trip crystallized the problem I wanted to solve. It wasn't just about navigating regulations—it was about creating a scalable solution in an industry that was anything but scalable by design. BYBE's foundation was taking shape: I wanted to build a platform that bridged the regulatory divide while empowering brands and retailers to collaborate within the confines of the law, no matter the state.
The insight was clear: there was an opportunity to build something meaningful at the intersection of technology, marketing, and regulation in the alcohol industry. But an idea is just that—an idea—until you create a solution that provides value.
The first challenge was navigating the fragmented legal landscape. What worked in California might be illegal in Texas. What brands were allowed to do with retailers in one state could be entirely off-limits in another. I knew that to create something scalable, we'd need to understand and respect the nuances of each state's laws while finding common ground for brands and retailers to collaborate.
I started by speaking to the large alcohol brands I worked with regularly. I asked them how they allocated their marketing budgets and what their thought processes were when choosing promotion opportunities. Most of them were eager to invest, but there was one major caveat: they wanted to see their content featured in retail apps. However, retail apps were in a bind—they didn't want to partner with just any technology provider; they wanted the best content to drive engagement.
This was where my experience working with Kroger paid off. I knew that alcohol brands were often limited in how they could spend their money, but I also knew they were willing to support retailers—especially ones that would feature or display their products in physical retail stores.
At this point, I was staring right at the Cold Start Problem that Andrew Chen talks about in his book. How do you get this flywheel spinning when both sides of the marketplace are waiting for the other to make the first move?
I realized that the first part of the flywheel would be securing large retail partners with the buying power to induce action from alcohol brands. Once we had retail partners on board, we could then leverage their scale to acquire and monetize through alcohol brands. This would create a dynamic where alcohol brands were incentivized to allocate their budgets, knowing their content would be featured prominently in retail apps, resulting in more sales in-store.
I began to see how this model could break the cold start deadlock. With the right retail partners, we could drive the flywheel forward, building trust with both brands and retailers in a way that wouldn't be possible if we tried to build everything from scratch.
One of the more strategic moves I made early on was focusing on building a regulatory moat. Coming from the alcohol space, I had a deep understanding of the regulatory limitations that existed—and instead of viewing those limitations as a roadblock, I saw them as a competitive advantage.
Alcohol marketing was unique. Retailers are prohibited from managing alcohol brands' marketing and rebate funds directly. This regulatory constraint effectively removed one of the biggest threats to our business: the possibility of retailers building similar solutions in-house. In many cases, if a technology provider gains traction, retailers often look to replicate that solution themselves. But in the alcohol space, the laws prevented them from doing so, which gave BYBE a distinct, protected position.
I also considered legacy coupon companies as potential competitors. However, their focus was primarily on traditional coupons, not cash-back rebates, which presented a larger geographical footprint and more complex regulatory barriers. The cashback model also had more potential for scale, especially when considering national campaigns, where rebates could be applied seamlessly across more states due to regulations. This made the competitive landscape much clearer. BYBE's unique positioning allowed us to scale rebates without running afoul of the law.
By focusing on the regulatory side of the alcohol industry and leveraging the very constraints that seemed like obstacles, I was able to build a competitive moat that protected BYBE from potential in-house development by retailers. It became clear that this regulatory moat was an essential part of our strategy, helping to ensure we were building something with a unique market perspective.
As we continued refining our approach and validating our hypothesis, luck struck. My former colleagues at Kroger, recommended us to Techstars, which was launching an accelerator in collaboration with Target.
When we went to interview for the program, we quickly learned that alcohol was a priority category for Target. This was a game-changer. Through Techstars, Target became our first corporate retailer, and by securing them, we'd be able to unlock the flywheel we'd been working toward. We were no longer just another startup in a crowded space—we had a major retailer on board, and that gave us the credibility and leverage to bring in alcohol brands. Our team dove headfirst and quickly finished our MVP—a solution that embeds alcohol brands' cashback offers inside retail apps.
As predicted, once we had Target on board, the alcohol brands quickly followed. The brands were eager to allocate budgets and feature their products in Target's app, knowing the potential for reach and consumer engagement. It was a classic case of the cold start problem being solved by a single, strategic partnership. The business model was simple: give the technology to retailers for free and monetize usage through alcohol brands.
This moment felt like we were gearing up for our rocketship to launch. The years researching regulations, the countless conversations with alcohol brands—it led to this. With Target as our first corporate partner, we had the leverage to drive the flywheel and scale BYBE to the next level.
This should be the part of the story where I talk about the constant evolution of our product—how we leveraged our relationships and large customers to build new products and unlock additional revenue opportunities. (Sigh) Well...
I told you startups were a roller coaster. After you gain a little initial traction, leadership and vision become the differentiators.
This is where I made my largest missteps:
Let's walk through the issues that prevented BYBE from reaching a massive scale. I'll also reflect on strategies I intend to use in the future.
One of the first things I did when starting BYBE was read Zero to One by Peter Thiel. He describes starting narrow and expanding over time. I thought to myself—alcohol rebates inside retail apps—that's about as specific as one can get. He also describes expanding vertically and horizontally, and I imagined all the ways we could sell incremental technology products to alcohol brands and retailers.
But I never articulated anything beyond alcohol rebates inside retail apps. This is like pitching Amazon to early employees as just an online book retailer. Imagine if Jeff Bezos had only hired book lovers who spent their careers in the book industry. They probably wouldn't have been excited about selling CDs, clothing, or electronics. But ""A to Z"" was in the company's DNA from the beginning.
Now consider the ""WTF"" moment in my team's head when I suggested doing something other than alcohol rebates. We launched with Target, onboarded a handful of additional retailers and alcohol brands were happy with our capabilities. From an outside perspective, evolving beyond the initial niche seems natural. But when you're laser-focused on a specific problem after years of research, expanding into adjacent areas doesn't feel appropriate when there's still market share left to capture.
I failed to convey a coherent vision of using the regulatory moat as a beachhead to do more for retailers. I failed to demonstrate incremental services we could provide to alcohol brands once we established ourselves as a technology partner. We pigeonholed ourselves as the alcohol rebate guys.
The result was mixed. Our limited scope made us the best in the world at one thing, but it also tethered us to a narrow product with limited long-term revenue opportunities. After the initial MVP, we added incremental features that were valuable to existing alcohol brands and retailers, but those features didn't unlock new revenue streams.
Moving forward, I'm more focused on defining a long-term vision. A narrow, focused launch is only the first step toward a broader goal. During Techstars, Brett Brohl from Bread & Butter Ventures always asked me two questions:
I could never answer those two questions.
If you don't have answers to them at your startup, that's fine. But you probably shouldn't be raising money from VCs. Venture capital comes with an expectation of rapid growth (2-3x revenue annually). There's an unspoken (but often explicit) understanding that you are building a massive company.
Our team, myself included, were all first-time founders. Our goal of creating the best alcohol rebate technology never aligned with the VC expectation of building a billion-dollar company—the market is not big enough. After a few years, most of the product was built. Our business was focused on sales and execution.
My inability to define a clear, long-term vision and introduce new products left us in the small but profitable category. We built a niche business, but after five years and a dozen retail clients, tensions rose as liquidity expectations loomed.
Logical investor questions:
Responses from the team:
Retailers, however, are notoriously slow technology adopters. Our sales cycles could take years, making the pace of implementation incompatible with VC-backed growth expectations. Even post-acquisition, these slow cycles persisted. It's an industry-wide problem.
My team didn't understand the unwritten expectation from VCs—that the goal is to grow fast and build a big company. I recruited people who wanted to work at a startup, not build a billion-dollar enterprise. The product stagnation and misaligned expectations with employees and investors ultimately led to our decision to sell the company. I didn't want to abandon the team that was in the trenches with me since day one. I also had a fiduciary responsibility to return money back to investors. We hired a new CTO that was brilliant, but our time was already running out.
With my next startup, I'm setting the initial expectation from day one: we are building a big company or going down swinging. If you're raising from VCs, ensure your vision aligns with that reality too. Your first product launch is just the initial step. Recruit people who want to build something massive. Investors expect home run swings, even if they come with a higher chance of striking out.
The vision drives goals, which serve as benchmarks. Goals are broken down into OKRs (Objectives and Key Results), creating a scorecard to track progress. Execution on OKRs positions you to raise VC funding. There are tons of resources on OKRs. I suggest implementation from the inception of your startup journey.
If you don't want to build a big company, bootstrap. If you need external funding for a small company, raise from friends, family, or angel investors, but be transparent about your goals.
At BYBE, we nailed the ""start narrow"" concept. We solved a specific problem—alcohol promotions and regulatory hurdles—with massive adjacent markets in retail tech, marketing tech, and digital ads. We solved the ""cold start"" problem by securing retailers first, knowing alcohol brands would follow. And they did.
But we never achieved true product-market fit due to integration costs and timing. Each retailer integration was a unique, one-off project due to different loyalty programs, app technologies, and POS systems. The result was a consulting company with recurring revenue post-integration, rather than a scalable tech company.
Retailers operate off a large backlog of different priorities, meaning even if BYBE added $30K in retail sales in year two, few would spend $80K on an integration when other opportunities existed. This left integrations in internal development queues for years.
Potential solutions:
Ultimately, we sold to Swiftly, a larger retail platform with additional capabilities.
I used to think product-market fit was purely a CAC vs. LTV equation. But some constraints can't be solved by adding more sales people. I underestimated the opportunity cost of internal development teams and the relative value of our product compared to other priorities. 
Now, I more intentionally factor integration timelines in the sales cycle. The time from first pitch to implementation adds years to the payback period. Understanding the path and timing from sales funnel to revenue, and the cost to implement is critical.
This was the cliff notes version of 7 years building BYBE. It was an incredible journey filled with lessons, challenges, and personal growth. I made mistakes, but I also learned invaluable insights that will shape my next venture.
Did I miss anything? Happy to dive deeper into any specific subjects. If you're a founder navigating similar challenges, I'd love to connect and swap stories. If you're an investor, operator, or just someone interested in startups—let's talk. drew@khaki.email
Until my next startup story, take care!

74,2025-02-24,"U.S. stocks were mixed on Monday. Investors are turning their attention to Nvidia’s upcoming earnings — the first time the AI chipmaker is reporting results since a breakthrough by Chinese AI startup DeepSeek sparked a selloff in Nvidia and other tech stocks last month.
By the end of the day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up about 0.08%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 lost 1.2% and 0.5%, respectively.
Here are stocks to watch today:
Apple (AAPL-0.79%) stock edged up after the iPhone maker said Monday that it will invest $500 billion in the United States over the next four years, with a focus on supporting domestic manufacturing and AI.
It plans to open a 250,000-square-foot manufacturing plant in 2026 that will produce servers, hire thousands of workers across a variety of fields, and launch a new education initiative. Apple also said it was committed to expanding its data centers across the U.S.
Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B+1.70%) offloaded more equities last quarter, expanding its record cash reserves to $334 billion. Warren Buffett defended the size of the cash hoard in his annual letter , saying the majority of his investors’ money would always be invested in shares, mainly of American companies. The stock gained on Monday.
Microsoft (MSFT-1.57%) shares fell slightly on Monday following an analyst report that the company canceled some U.S. data center leases, potentially signaling an oversupply of AI infrastructure.
On Friday, analysts at TD Cowen (TD-0.36%) said in a note that the tech giant had canceled leases worth “a couple of hundred megawatts,” or approximately two data centers worth of capacity.
Shares of athleticwear brand Nike (NKE-1.37%) gained 5% to above $80 after Jefferies (JEF-1.31%) upgraded its recommendation to “buy” from “hold” and increased its price target to $115 from $75, making the stock a “top pick” on anticipated improvements in profit margin and earnings per share.
Nvidia (NVDA-7.37% stock rose as the AI chip powerhouse is set to release its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday after the bell. After Chinese AI startup DeepSeek spooked investors in January, Nvidia’s stock plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record for a U.S. company.
Palantir (PLTR-5.01%)  extended its decline on Monday following last week’s plunge that was driven by a new share sales initiative by the CEO and a media report of potential U.S. defense budget cuts. The stock is now about 30% down from its 2025 peak earlier this month.
Robinhood (HOOD+0.06%) stocked gained on news that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is dropping its investigation into the company’s crypto arm. The move comes just a few days after the financial watchdog dismissed the case against Coinbase.

Seashells, seaweed and the odd piece of driftwood are all standard seaside finds. But a Jeep, an unexploded bomb, hundreds of plastic eggs or a fleet of brand-new motorbikes? That’s a different story. From the bizarre to the downright baffling, beaches around the world have played host to some truly unexpected wash-ups.
Ready to see what the tide brought in? Read on for weird things found on beaches around the world...

The low tides on Morecambe Bay at Bolton-Le-Sands in England revealed a car wreckage, believed to be a Jeep Cherokee. The vehicle has become a local mystery, with many stories and theories explaining how it ended up stranded at the beach.
Some say it is the abandoned Jeep of cocklers that tragically drowned close by in 2004, while other theories claim that the car has been lost since the 1980s.

In January 2012, Waihi Beach in New Zealand became an unexpected dumping ground for thousands of milk powder bags – washed ashore in the wake of a maritime disaster.
The culprit turned out to be The Rena, a cargo ship that struck an offshore reef in 2011, spilling 350 tonnes of oil and as many as 300 shipping containers into the sea. The wreck became one of New Zealand’s worst environmental disasters, leaving behind a surreal scene of scattered cargo along the coastline.

Fossilised woolly mammoth teeth occasionally wash up on beaches, providing a rare glimpse into the prehistoric world. At Zandmotor Beach in the Netherlands, these ancient molars have been found alongside other Ice Age relics, evidence that mammoths once roamed areas now buried beneath the sea.
Similar discoveries have been made in Alaska, Florida and the UK, where shifting tides and erosion have revealed mammoth teeth dating back over 100,000 years.

Children on Germany's North Sea island Langeoog thought the Easter bunny had come early in January 2017, when thousands of colourful plastic eggs floated onto its sandy beaches.
The eggs, which contained little toys, had washed ashore from a Danish freight container that had lost its contents in stormy weather. Locals, including children and tourists, congregated to help with the clear up.

Looking like something from another planet, this bizarre sea creature washed up on Step Beach in Fairhaven, Australia, in January 2024. The person who found it shared photos in the Field Naturalists Club of Victoria Facebook group, hoping to solve the mystery.
Experts suggested it was likely a sea tulip – a strange marine organism covered in a bumpy, sponge-like surface. These creatures grow in a variety of colours and typically live at depths of up to 262 feet (80m), anchored to rocks by a long stalk, much like an underwater flower.

In January 2007, Branscombe Beach, a stretch of shingle along the Jurassic Coast in Devon, became the site of a modern-day treasure hunt after the MSC Napoli, a 62,000-tonne container ship, was damaged in a storm and deliberately run aground.
Rough seas sent shipping containers spilling into the water, washing BMW motorbikes, car parts, wine barrels and beauty products ashore. Despite warnings from authorities, people flocked to the beach with vans and wheelbarrows to claim whatever they could before officials sealed off the area.

During the 1980s, novelty plastic phones in the shape of the infamous lasagne-eating cartoon cat Garfield began appearing on beaches in Brittany.
The mystery wasn't solved until March 2019, however, when a shipping container filled with the devices – washed up during a storm some 30 years before – was found in a sea cave.

Sydney’s Northern Beaches were left baffled in January 2025 when white and grey balls washed ashore, forcing nine beach closures. Tests found hydrocarbons, fatty acids and E. coli, later linked to soap scum, cosmetics and traces of pharmaceuticals and animal waste.
The source remains unknown, with possible culprits including sewage leaks, stormwater runoff, or maritime pollution. While the beaches have reopened, the investigation continues – so locals might want to watch their step before taking a dip.

The rusting wreck of the MV Panagiotis, stranded on the shores of this Greek island since October 1980, has long captivated curious visitors. Now a permanent fixture on the northwest coast, the skeletal remains of the ship draws thousands of tourists each year.
How the Panagiotis met its fate remains a topic of debate. One widely believed theory suggests it was a smuggling vessel, abandoned by its crew while fleeing the Greek Navy during a chase from Albania to Piraeus.

Queenslanders are no strangers to bizarre beach phenomena, and sea foam is one of the most striking. This thick, soap-like froth often blankets the shoreline after storms, forming when dissolved organic matter in the ocean is churned up by powerful waves.
In March 2017, Cyclone Debbie created a spectacular display, with beaches closing as massive walls of white foam rolled in. In some towns, strong winds lifted the froth into the air, making it look as though it was snowing along the coast – a rare and surreal sight in the tropics.

Cyclone Debbie left a trail of destruction along the Queensland coast, battering homes and infrastructure with fierce winds and torrential rain. The storm ripped boats from their moorings, smashing them against rocks before they were swept ashore, leaving harbours littered with wreckage.
The powerful winds also uprooted massive trees, sending them crashing onto roads and beaches. Entire door frames, roofing sheets and debris from buildings were lifted and hurled across the coastline, turning once-pristine beaches into chaotic wrecking yards.

In 2009, a rusted aerial bomb surfaced on a beach in Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts – a stark reminder of the island’s wartime past. The area was a training ground for World War II pilots, and remnants of their exercises still emerge decades later.
In June 2017, another discovery made headlines – a 100-pound (45kg) photo flash bomb, adding to the eerie collection of long-buried military relics hidden beneath the sands.

It's not just the ocean that reveals surprising finds – rivers can too. In August 2015, a megalodon tooth was discovered on the shores of the Kupa River near Pokupsko, about 37 miles (60km) from Zagreb, Croatia.
The megalodon, an ancient shark that lived 23 to 3.6 million years ago, is believed to have grown up to 59 feet (18m) long, making it one of the largest and most powerful predators in history.

Hundreds flocked to Muriwai Beach near Auckland to catch a glimpse of this strange-looking object that washed up in December 2016. Nicknamed the Muriwai Monster, the mysterious find had locals buzzing until experts from the New Zealand Marine Sciences Society weighed in.
Their verdict? Likely just a hefty piece of driftwood encrusted with gooseneck barnacles. Not quite sci-fi, but still a fascinating reminder of the ocean’s ability to turn the ordinary into something extraordinary.

Marooned jellyfish are a common sight on beaches around the world. But in May 2017 mega swarms of the jelly-like creatures, including the large barrel jellyfish, covered beaches in Wales and other parts of the UK.
The unusually high numbers were due to warm weather increasing plankton and drawing the gelatinous creatures inshore. In Queensland, Australia, a beach was described as looking like 'bubble wrap', when masses of blue blubber jellyfish carpeted the sands.

In the 1970s, the Osborne Reef off Fort Lauderdale, Florida, was created by dumping over two million tires into the ocean, hoping to form an artificial reef. Instead, the bindings eroded, and loose tires drifted, damaging natural coral rather than fostering marine life.
For decades, these rogue tires have been washing up on Florida’s beaches and even appearing as far away as the Carolinas and the Gulf of Mexico. Large-scale clean-up efforts began in the 2000s, with divers and military teams working to remove the tires, but the process has been slow and costly.

In 2011, a grand piano mysteriously appeared on a sandbar in Biscayne Bay, Miami, baffling locals and authorities. Speculation ran wild, but the mystery was solved when student Nicholas Harrington admitted to placing it there as part of a creative project.
While the authorities initially debated whether to remove it, they eventually left it in place, as it posed no environmental risk. For weeks, the weathered instrument became a viral sensation, attracting curious visitors and photographers before nature finally reclaimed it.

In July 2007, a World War II-era aircraft resurfaced on a Welsh beach, more than 60 years after crashing off the coast in 1942. Known as the Maid of Harlech, the plane went down during a training exercise when its engines failed, sending it into the sea. Remarkably, the pilot escaped unharmed, leaving the aircraft buried beneath the sand until shifting tides revealed its wreckage decades later.

The empty egg cases of sharks often get washed up on UK beaches and can be found among the seaweed.
Known as mermaid's purse, the tough leathery-looking cases protect the embryo of sharks, skate and rays. Each one contains a single embryo. This specimen belongs to a catshark, also known as dogfish.

In 2008, two World War II mines were discovered on Lusty Glaze Beach near Newquay, Cornwall, creating quite a stir among locals and visitors.
The rusted explosives were spotted at low tide, wedged between rocks, likely having been buried for decades before finally being revealed by shifting sands. Authorities quickly secured the area, and bomb disposal experts were called in to assess and safely remove the wartime relics.

During the icy depths of winter, Lake Michigan becomes the stage for a rare natural phenomenon – perfectly shaped ice balls floating in the water and piling up along the shoreline.
The frozen orbs form when chunks break off from larger ice sheets and are worn smooth by the waves. One of the most dramatic occurrences took place in January 2017, when thousands of these icy spheres accumulated on the beach at Port Sheldon, Michigan.

The remote beaches of Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago in the Arctic, have a stark and strange beauty – especially when whale bones lie scattered along the shore. These bleached remains occasionally wash up in the area, providing an easy meal for polar bears, Arctic foxes and scavenging birds.
While the sight may seem eerie, it’s a natural part of the ecosystem. In this harsh environment, every resource is used, and even a drifting carcass can sustain wildlife for weeks.

The devastating impact of an oil spill lingers for years, affecting both the environment and local communities. Pictured here are tar balls – sticky clumps of oil, sand and shells – washed up on Gulf Shores, Alabama, in 2010, following the Deepwater Horizon disaster.
Even years later, the spill’s effects resurfaced. In 2012, Hurricane Isaac churned up the seafloor, sending tar balls back onto the shores of Alabama and Louisiana, including Elmer’s Island.

The pristine white sands of Ao Prao Beach on Thailand’s Koh Samet were tainted by crude oil in 2013, after a faulty transfer between a tanker and a seabed pipeline spilled 50,000 litres (13,200 gallons) offshore.
The spill left behind a thick film of oil on the beach, while a sizable slick floated just off the shoreline. A massive clean-up operation was launched, with soldiers and volunteers working to remove the hazardous waste and restore the popular beach.

Known as egagropila, these strange hairy spheres are the remains of Posidonia australis, a seagrass also known as Neptune Grass that grows in large meadows around Australia's southern coast.
The fibrous remains of the foliage can often wash up on seashores in large round clumps, especially after stormy weather, egagropila from Posidonia oceania, a species endemic to the Mediterranean, can also be found on beaches around Europe.

K'gari (formerly Fraser Island), off Queensland's coast, has a long history of shipwrecks, but the most famous is the SS Maheno, which ran aground in July 1935. Built in 1905, the Maheno operated between Sydney and Auckland before serving as a World War I hospital ship in Europe.
Decommissioned and sold for scrap, it was being towed to Japan when a cyclone snapped its tow chain, leaving it adrift until it crashed onto K'gari's shore. Today, its rusting remains stand as an eerie landmark, slowly disappearing into the island’s sands.

Unfortunately, washed-up plastic on beaches is far from a strange sight – but a bizarrely large number of worn toothbrushes were found at Genesta Bay in Queensland's Whitsunday Islands. These were collected by a skipper at eco-resort The Whitsunday Wilderness Lodge as part of its clean-up excursions.

Morning walkers were greeted with a curious sight in August 2017 when vast sections of a plastic pipe were washed up on the sands between Winterton-on-Sea and Sea Palling in Norfolk.
The pipes, which reached lengths of up to 1,570 feet (478.5m) and had an 8-foot (2.4m) diameter, had come loose from Norwegian tugs bound for Algeria, following an accident with an Icelandic container ship.

This striking black-sand beach in Iceland becomes even more beautiful when huge hunks of sparkling ice are strewn across it. Known as Diamond Beach, it's located by the Jökulsárlón glacial lagoon in southeast Iceland.
Ice chunks from Vatnajökull, Europe's largest glacier, are regularly washed out to sea, polished by the waves and deposited on the beach where they glisten like diamonds. The ice pieces could be thousands of years old.

These corkscrew-shaped egg cases, found washed up on beaches in Western Australia, likely belong to a Port Jackson shark. Their distinctive ridged design isn’t just for show – it helps secure them in rocky crevices, preventing them from drifting away or falling prey to predators.
Inside, a baby shark develops over six to 10 months before hatching and swimming off into the ocean. Once emptied, these spiral egg cases can be carried by the currents and occasionally end up on the shore.

A bunker on a beach isn’t something you expect to stumble across, but thanks to coastal erosion, that’s exactly what you’ll find on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent. These World War II concrete bunkers, once part of Britain’s coastal defences, have been slowly displaced as the island’s cliffs crumble into the sea.
Sheppey has lost around a third of its landmass since Roman times, and shifting landscapes have left these wartime relics stranded in odd places. The Warden Point Battery, for example, now sits at an unnatural angle, looking like it was dropped onto the beach from above.

Before the pandemic, many of Hong Kong’s 7.4 million residents were already used to wearing face masks due to pollution and health concerns. But when COVID-19 hit, mask usage surged – and so did the number of discarded masks washing up on Hong Kong’s beaches.
Since surgical masks are made from polypropylene, a plastic that breaks down very slowly, environmentalists have raised concerns about the threat to marine life.

Unfortunately Hong Kong isn't the only place where disposable face masks have been discovered. This photo shows a beach in California. According to local organisation Heal the Bay, face masks and PPE washed up on a number of California beaches after a storm in December 2020.

In October 2023, this brightly coloured and beguiling creature was discovered on the sand at Porth Dafarch beach, Anglesey. Discovered by dog walkers, it may look pretty, but this sea creature is in fact deadly.
It's a Portuguese Man o'War, a type of jellyfish with tentacles that carry venom-filled sacs used to paralyse fish and other marine creatures. Although rare, experts say increasing numbers of exotic organisms like this could appear along the British coast due to rising sea temperatures.

In 1992, a shipping container carrying nearly 29,000 rubber ducks was lost at sea during a storm in the North Pacific Ocean. Ever since, these hardy little toys have been turning up on beaches worldwide, from Hawaii and Alaska to the UK and Australia.
Their decades-long journey has fascinated oceanographers, who have used their movements to study ocean currents, wind patterns and plastic pollution.

If you take a stroll along the beaches of the Cook Islands, you might find yourself surrounded by an unexpected sight – sea cucumbers. These slug-like creatures, often scattered across the shoreline, may not win any beauty contests, but they play a crucial role in the marine ecosystem.
Much like earthworms, they filter and clean the ocean floor, helping to maintain a healthy environment. The Cook Islands are home to around 14 species of sea cucumbers, some prized for their culinary value and others harvested for their medicinal properties.

In January 2008, Dorset’s beaches were littered with heavy timber after the MV Ice Prince, a 328-foot (100m) Greek-registered cargo ship, sank in the English Channel. The vessel lost over 2,000 tonnes of its 5,260-tonne cargo before sinking, sending vast amounts of wood drifting toward the shore.
Worthing Beach was temporarily closed as heavy machinery was brought in to clear the debris, but not before opportunistic locals waded into the waves to salvage pieces for themselves.

A large red buoy was spotted lying on its side on a stretch of shore between South Forest and Coligny beaches on the island of Hilton Head, South Carolina, in September 2017.
The US Coast Guard buoy was washed ashore during Tropical Storm Irma – it was later identified as Buoy No. 8 and had been carried about eight nautical miles (15km) to the beach by strong waves.

A smallholder who cares for 140 rescue animals has won a two-year battle to remain at her sanctuary in the Scottish Borders. Tracey Milton, who moved to the five-acre site from Somerset, was told by enforcement officers she had no right to live there despite the previous owner being granted permission. After a legal fight, Scottish Borders Council’s review committee ruled she could stay for life. Tracey, who has chronic COPD and depression, says the decision ensures she can continue caring for her animals and hopes to offer visits to those with disabilities and mental health issues.

In the summer of 2024, I noted that the stock market was likely to move higher. However, the big tech leaders were seen as too extended and overvalued. This group was due for a correction. If the market was to move higher and the tech leaders were to correct, then other lagging stocks would have to start outperforming, which has been the case. Let us take a closer look.
The relative strength of the equally-weighted NASDAQ versus the S&P 500 turned up in late December and remains strong. This indicates that the average stock in the NASDAQ 100 is stronger than the cap-weighted S&P 500. The big-cap tech stocks have been lagging while the smaller weights in the index have been rising. The result: Many more stocks are rising but the equities that have the greatest influence on the indices have lagged. This is in sharp contrast to the situation in 2024 in which only 25% of the stocks outperformed the S&P 500.
Note the rising relative strength as denoted by the green line. 
The relative strength screen shows that within the NASDAQ 100, the big eight tech stocks are ranked from No. 6 (Netflix) to No. 75 (Microsoft). Here are the stocks in relative strength order with the cycles recommendations in parentheses:
Netflix (hold)
Meta Platforms (sell)
Tesla (buy)
Nvidia (sell)
Amazon (sell)
Apple (hold)
Google (sell)
Microsoft (cycle low in March)
This monthly cycle graph explains the buy signal on Tesla.
This accurate monthly cycle points to higher prices through 2025.
Here is another graph that explains the sell opinion on Nvidia:
This cycle peaked at the price high and points down though the year. 
The top five NASDAQ current relative performers are:
1. Palantir
2. Super Micro Systems
3. Axon
4. Atlassian
5. DoorDash
Some of these stocks are extremely overbought and too risky to buy now. From these new leaders, here are two stocks that can be added to portfolios.
Super Micro came down hard, and is now giving longer-term buy signals, supported by rising cycles.
There are weekly buy signals and a very oversold monthly price. 
Atlassian features technical strength and a rising monthly cycle. Use the pullback in this cycle and any NASDAQ weakness to accumulate shares.
The cycle rises from March to June. "

Changing habits among search engine users have begun to take a toll on the biggest players in the search space — namely Google.
The tech giant still enjoys an enormous chunk of the search market — 89%, October through December in 2024, according to an estimate from Statcounter — but that’s the lowest its share has been in a decade.
Because the tech giant has been synonymous with search, it’s the player with the most to lose, but advertisers need to find new productive ways to reach consumers too.
Depending on your client category, search is an important avenue between a brand and its customer base. It’s also a lower-funnel channel —  one that allows brands to reel in consumers when they’re relatively close to a purchase.
Paid search is typically part of an advertiser’s battery of “always-on” spending, while the task of ensuring a brand’s digital presence was up to scratch and as appealing as possible (to both search engine algorithms and users) has long been a background task. Spending on keyword search ads totaled $330 billion worldwide last year, according to IPG’s Magna.
But shifting search behaviors have put a dent in the search traffic some brands typically receive. 
That would depend on your product category and your target audience. The effects aren’t being felt equally. 66% of 18-24 year olds and 51% of 25-34 year olds regularly refer to AI tools for product recommendations; older users are using more traditional forms of search, according to YouGov.
Still, for many brands, a fall in search engine usage has translated to lower search site traffic, according to Chris Actis, president of agency True Media.
Actis didn’t name specific clients, but told Digiday that advertisers working with the agency had seen organic Google site traffic fall year-on-year — 7% for a healthcare client, 6% for a financial services brand and 2% for a defense contractor — between May 2024 and February 2025.
“Search used to be this totally safe bet, right? Now it’s moving away from being a slam dunk,” said Matt Allfrey, head of SEO, EMEA at media agency PMG. The company handles SEO for advertisers like Homeserve, Hyundai, Kohler and Omni Hotels.
Well, partially. Publishers have feared the potential impact of AI overview tools since they launched last spring. But brands are keeping a close eye on their impact too. 
In the case of True Media’s clientele, organic site traffic began falling after Google unveiled its AI overview tool powered by Gemini. The AI-written answers to search queries have become a common sight for users — Google’s AI overviews now appear above almost a third of all search results, per research by AI firm BrightEdge — and reduce the need for a user to go to a website to answer their question. 
Gartner projections made in 2023 and 2024 suggested that search engine usage would fall 25% by 2026, and 50% by 2028, owing to the update of gen AI tools including AI overviews and applications like Perplexity.
“The growth of AI has really shifted how users behave and how they interact with these search platforms, specifically Google,” said Juan Gonzalez, head of digital at full service agency Mādin.
But it’s not the only factor.
In short, more web users — particularly younger ones — are choosing to use social platforms as their primary means of finding information online. TikTok, YouTube, Reddit, Instagram and Pinterest have replaced Google as their first port of call, while one eMarketer estimate pointed to Amazon as the first-choice retail search engine for American web users.
It’s a long-expected trend, but paired with the increase in AI search usage, it’s beginning to register. “Both [trends] are impacting organic search for websites,” said Katie Tweedy, director of SEO and content marketing at Collective Measures.
“More people using AI [for] research… and more people using social media for search… has coalesced into fewer searches happening on Google, effectively,” said Allfrey.
The short answer? They’re overhauling SEO practices and shifting paid spend. The argument for the latter is simple enough – go to where your users are.
“You can follow the audience around, that’s relatively simple to do in the scheme of things,” said Allfrey.
According to media buyers who spoke with Digiday, potential destinations include Reddit, Instagram, YouTube and TikTok. Måns Gårdfeldt, partner at indie digital agency Spekk, estimated that his agency’s clients had taken 10%-20% of their paid search spending, and transferred it to search ads within social platforms. 
“Social search will only grow, in my book,” he said.
Tuning up a brand’s SEO to make it jibe better with AI readers is probably the harder task, given how difficult it is to accurately gauge the inner workings of ChatGPT or Gemini from the outside. 
“Everything that happens within that generative AI is totally untraceable. Somebody goes in, they have this conversation in a black box, they come out the other side, and they’re incredibly qualified and ready to convert on your website, and you’ve got zero idea what happened in that journey,” said Allfrey.
While some companies, including Brandtech AI firm Jellyfish, have released tools that claim to give advertisers a decent glimpse through the veil, solutions that take its insights into account are still more art than science. 
In practical terms, agency execs say their clients have reviewed the written copy on their sites, pulled separate landing pages, and created more blog material with named authors – all with the aim of seeming authoritative and approachable.

81,2025-02-24,"AI-generated images are becoming so convincing that even skilled photographers are being accused of faking their work.

Coming to you from Rick Bebbington, this eye-opening video explores the challenges and potential consequences of AI-generated imagery. Many photographers worry that AI will flood the market with synthetic images, making it harder for authentic work to stand out. While this concern is valid, the reality is that oversaturation has been a problem since the digital era began. The photographers who survived the shift from film to digital were those who adapted, and the same will hold true with AI. Certain types of photography, such as product shots and stock imagery, have already been impacted by digital trends. AI may accelerate these changes, but it’s not the first technological shift to challenge photographers.
Bebbington also highlights the issue of AI’s ability to replicate styles by scraping existing images without permission. This raises ethical and legal concerns, as AI models are built on the work of real photographers, sometimes to the point of mimicking their unique artistic signatures. Some photographers are pushing back by reintroducing watermarks, but AI can remove these just as easily as it can strip metadata. As a result, there’s growing urgency for stronger copyright protections to prevent AI from exploiting creative work without consent. While AI-generated images may appear perfect, they lack the human experience and storytelling that give photography its emotional impact. That distinction remains a critical advantage for real photographers.
One of the most pressing concerns is the way AI-generated images dominate social media platforms. Bebbington notes that sites like Facebook and Pinterest are overrun with synthetic images, many of which are promoted by engagement-driven algorithms. This creates a cycle where AI images, often backed by AI-generated comments, gain more visibility than real photographs. Viewers who can’t easily distinguish between AI and authentic work contribute to the problem by interacting with these posts, further diminishing the reach of genuine photography. This shift raises questions about how photographers can reclaim their space and educate audiences on the value of real images.
To counter AI’s impact, photographers can take steps to prove their work’s authenticity. Behind-the-scenes footage, time-lapse videos, and process documentation help demonstrate that an image was captured in real life. Sharing work-in-progress shots and multiple angles of the same scene can also add credibility. Bebbington himself has started using Ray-Ban Meta glasses to capture video proof of his shooting process. Beyond technical proof, embracing imperfection can make images look less like AI-generated work. AI often produces flawless, hyper-realistic results, whereas natural photography carries subtle flaws that enhance its authenticity. Check out the video above for the full rundown from Bebbington.
Alex Cooke is a Cleveland-based portrait, events, and landscape photographer. He holds an M.S. in Applied Mathematics and a doctorate in Music Composition. He is also an avid equestrian.
Silly. Having to 'show your work' or proving your authenticity doesn't matter in end. People just want to look at pretty photos and maybe a small subset would care to look into your authenticity. Then they'll realize landscape photographers embellish the hell out of photos, shrug, and never care to put in the effort to check someone's authenticity again."
82,2025-02-24,"At a conservative political conference last week, Elon Musk wielded a chainsaw, a symbol of his efforts to slash the federal bureaucracy.
But at least in the corporate world, chainsaw-wielding executives have an abysmal record of effectively cutting costs, Forbes executive editor Matt Schifrin writes. In 1996, for instance, investors recruited the infamous Albert Dunlap, known as Chainsaw Al, to turn around the beleaguered consumer products company Sunbeam.
As two stories we’ve republished from the archives show, Forbes was skeptical at the time about whether such an approach could work. A few years later, we were the first to uncover that Dunlap, who passed away in 2019, had been cooking the books to prop up sales.
Protestors hold placards during a demonstration against the policies of President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's DOGE near Musk's SpaceX headquarters in Washington, DC, on February 19, 2025.
In an X post Saturday, billionaire Elon Musk said all federal employees would receive an email asking them to explain the work they’ve done over the past week, and employees who fail to respond will be forced to resign. Musk’s post came hours after President Donald Trump had praised his work on Truth Social, but added he would “like to see him get more aggressive.”
MORE: High-ranking officials at multiple agencies have directed employees to not respond to Musk’s email, including the FBI, and the Departments of State, Defense, Justice and Health and Human Services, among others that deal with classified information. The American Federation of Government Employees, the largest union representing federal workers, decried the Musk directive as “plainly unlawful” and said it does not believe there’s any authority requiring workers to respond to it.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 1.7% on Friday, its worst day this year, following a report that the federal government is probing UnitedHealth Group. Shares of the U.S.’ largest health insurer plummeted as much as 12.7%, the latest in a turbulent stretch on Wall Street as its business practices come under scrutiny.
MORE: Luigi Mangione, the 26-year-old charged in the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, appeared at a Manhattan courthouse Friday for a brief hearing. Mangione has pleaded not guilty to 11 state charges in New York, including one count of first-degree murder in furtherance of an act of terrorism, two counts of second-degree murder, seven weapons possession-related charges, as well as one charge for possession of forged identification.
The SEC has agreed to drop its lawsuit against Coinbase, following what the crypto exchange said was a change in “political leadership” at the agency. The SEC sued Coinbase, the largest crypto firm in the U.S., in 2023, accusing it of failing to register as a securities exchange, one of several crypto firms targeted under the Biden Administration.
TikTok returned this month to Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store, after the two tech giants received letters from U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi assuring the companies the Department of Justice would not enforce a ban passed by Congress. But it took two attempts, after Apple and Google were unable to comply with an earlier DOJ letter, Forbes has learned, fearing enormous fines under the ban despite President Donald Trump delaying its enforcement.
A federal judge blocked parts of President Donald Trump’s executive orders targeting DEI on Friday, arguing his orders directing government grant recipients to halt DEI programs are too vague to be enforced or infringe on free speech. U.S. District Judge Adam Abelson granted a preliminary injunction requested by the city of Baltimore and higher education groups who sued the Trump Administration, arguing his executive orders targeting DEI were made to “chill” free speech.
Timothée Chalamet at the 31st Screen Actors Guild Awards held at Shrine Auditorium and Expo Hall on February 23, 2025 in Los Angeles.
Timothée Chalamet won the best actor prize at the Screen Actors Guild Awards Sunday, while the political thriller Conclave took home the best ensemble cast prize, in a set of surprise wins that have upended predictions for next week’s Academy Awards. Demi Moore took home the best actress award for her leading role in The Substance, adding to her wins at the Critics Choice Awards and the Golden Globes and making her the firm favorite to win the top prize at the Oscars.
A measles outbreak in Texas neared 100 cases Friday, and the state’s Department of State Health Services warned more cases of the highly contagious virus are likely. The vast majority of sick patients are unvaccinated, or have an unknown vaccination status, the department said. The measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, which has been available for over half a century, is safe and highly effective, according to the CDC.
President Donald Trump demanded that Ukraine supply the U.S. with $500 billion in rare minerals as part of a repayment deal for the money it has sent Ukraine to finance its war efforts. According to a report from Congress, the U.S. has supplied Ukraine with just over $174 billion in military aid as of January—far lower than the $350 billion Trump has falsely claimed.
True Link Financial cofounder and CEO Kai Stinchcombe was inspired by his grandmother's credit card charges after she got Alzheimer's.
TOPLINE True Link Financial, a 12-year-old San Francisco-based financial technology company, offers a debit card with spending controls expressly designed for people with dementia, other cognitive deficits or addiction issues.
After scrambling to survive early on, True Link has been in the black for the past two years, netting $2 million on $30 million in revenue in 2024, says CEO and cofounder Kai Stinchcombe. This month, the firm was named to the Forbes Fintech 50 list for 2025.
Over the years, investors have poured $60 million into the startup. In its last fundraise—in January 2022, during the height of the fintech boom—True Link raised $12 million at a $144 million valuation. Since then, its revenue has doubled, Stinchcombe says. He and cofounder Claire McDonnell still own about 30% of the company, Forbes estimates.
The 100-employee operation reached this point with just two tightly related core products: It currently oversees more than 150,000 individual debit cards for users with cognitive disabilities and for those recovering from (or in the throes of) addiction. True Link charges a $12-a-month fee for an individual stand-alone True Link Visa Prepaid Card, with the card bringing in about two-thirds of its revenue.
The other third comes from True Link’s growing business as an SEC-registered investment advisor, managing nearly $1.5 billion in individual and pooled “special needs” trusts. True Link charges 1% of assets to manage trusts, but what it’s really selling here is knowledge of what can and can’t be done with special needs trusts, plus a handy way to supervise and document how the money is spent through its debit cards.
WHY IT MATTERS “Financial losses are often the first sign of a dementia diagnosis,” says Forbes fellow Lindsey Choo. “As a 2023 study pointed out, the median wealth in households drops by more than half in the years leading up to a dementia diagnosis. After realizing that both of their grandmothers lost money to organizations preying on their memory loss, True Link founders Kai Stinchcombe and Claire McDonnell set out to build a solution for that problem.”
“It’s an example of how two entrepreneurs identified an underserved customer base and built a profitable company in that process.”

Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba touted its AI ambitions in what was a strong quarterly report last week, and saw its stock surge on both the New York and Hong Kong exchanges. Alibaba released its Qwen 2.5-Max model in January, which they say outperforms DeepSeek and some OpenAI models:
333%: Year-over-year increase in Alibaba’s net income, thanks to income from operations and changes in the value of its equity investments
Almost $1 billion: Increase in the net worth of cofounder Jack Ma, who is no longer chair, but still partially derives his wealth from a stake in the company
$120 billion: Boost to Alibaba’s market cap in the U.S. so far in 2025
If you get a tax refund, you overpaid in taxes last year, but there are several ways to maximize how much you get back. First, review your withholding based on changes in income, and identify deductions and tax credits you can claim. It’s also key to choose the right filing status—for married couples, filing jointly often reduces tax liability, but filing separately can be beneficial for certain situations like when one spouse has high medical expenses.

The energy industry is undergoing a major transformation. The push for transition, the rise of advanced technologies and the need for operational efficiency are reshaping the sector. At this intersection of energy and technology lies a tremendous opportunity—not just for sustainability, but for financial growth and competitive advantage.
Investments in hardware, software and artificial intelligence (AI) are empowering companies to reduce costs, optimize energy usage and make smarter, data-driven decisions. Yet, amid the excitement over these technologies, a critical enabler often goes unnoticed: system integration.
System integration is the process of ensuring that new technologies, legacy systems and data flows work seamlessly together. Without it, even the most sophisticated technologies operate in silos, leaving companies with underperforming investments. For energy companies, integration is a foundation of operational excellence, financial success and market leadership.
Energy companies often focus on acquiring the latest tools—AI for predictive analytics, cloud platforms for scalability or IoT devices for real-time monitoring. While these technologies hold immense promise, their value depends entirely on how well they are integrated into existing systems.
Here’s why integration is frequently sidelined:
1. Focus On Immediate Returns: Companies prioritize short-term wins like deploying AI or launching new software without considering the underlying infrastructure needed to support these technologies.
2. Legacy System Challenges: Many firms rely on legacy systems. Integrating modern software requires planning and expertise, often seen as costly or time-consuming.
3. Vendor Complexity: Multi-vendor environments—common in large-scale projects—make integration challenging. Each vendor’s solution may work well individually, but connecting them into a unified system requires significant effort.
4. Underestimated ROI Of Integration: Unlike AI solutions or cloud services, integration doesn’t immediately produce visible outcomes. However, it is essential for achieving long-term efficiencies, reducing operational costs and scaling innovations.
System integration is a strategic investment. For example, consider a wind farm operator managing hundreds of turbines. Sensors monitor critical data like wind speed, vibration and temperature, while a control system manages turbine operations. Data flows from the field to the cloud where AI analyzes it for predictive maintenance and performance optimization. Generative AI helps simulate blade adjustments to improve efficiency, and the insights are fed into an ERP system for scheduling maintenance and procuring parts.
Without integration, these systems would operate in silos, leading to inefficiencies, missed opportunities and higher costs. Through a strategic approach to integration, the operator can better ensure key benefits. These include:
• Enhanced Efficiency: Integration helps eliminate redundancies, reduce downtime and ensure smooth operations. For example, unified data streams across AI and cloud platforms allow for precise energy forecasting, preventing overproduction or unnecessary energy purchases.
• Cost Savings: Properly integrated systems enable real-time monitoring and predictive analytics, reducing maintenance costs.
• Competitive Advantage: A well-integrated system provides agility. Companies can rapidly deploy new technologies, scale operations and respond to market changes faster than competitors struggling with siloed systems.
• Data-Driven Decision-Making: Integration helps ensure that data from diverse sources—equipment, IoT sensors and cloud platforms—is consolidated and accessible, allowing executives to make informed decisions.
• Future-Proofing Investments: As the energy sector evolves, integrated systems provide the flexibility to incorporate new technologies without overhauling existing infrastructure.
As energy companies navigate this technology-driven transformation, they must rethink how they approach system integration. To stay ahead, organizations should take a strategic approach by focusing on the following key areas:
Seamless integration requires a deliberate strategy, ensuring IT and OT teams collaborate while adhering to industry standards such as IEC 62443 for cybersecurity and IEC 62264 for enterprise-control system integration.
Modernizing the Purdue Model through micro-segmentation enhances security, enabling cloud-based analytics while maintaining industrial control system reliability. Additionally, ensuring interoperability between legacy SCADA, DCS and modern cloud platforms demands precise alignment with these standards to bridge the gap between operational stability and digital transformation.
Fostering collaboration across IT and OT teams is essential for overcoming integration barriers. A key strategy is to implement a cross-functional integration task force that brings together IT architects, control engineers and cybersecurity experts to jointly assess existing systems and develop migration strategies.
Instead of a disruptive rip-and-replace approach, organizations can adopt progressive interoperability where legacy SCADA and DCS systems are incrementally integrated with cloud-based platforms through API gateways and edge computing solutions. Reference models like IEC 62541 (OPC UA) should be leveraged to ensure interoperability without sacrificing control reliability.
To prevent vendor lock-in and ensure seamless scalability, companies should align their integration efforts with well-established frameworks. IEC 62264 (ISA-95), for example, provides a robust model for bridging ERP systems with MES platforms, ensuring smooth data flow across different levels of the organization. Additionally, adopting a standardized data fabric approach—using open architectures such as MQTT and Kafka—can help harmonize real-time data exchange across disparate systems.
Business leaders should establish KPIs that measure integration success, such as reduction in unplanned downtime, increased asset utilization and lower total cost of ownership (TCO). Additionally, leaders must foster a culture where integration is embedded in strategic decision-making, ensuring teams understand its value beyond IT.
By adopting a structured and standards-driven approach to integration, energy companies can future-proof their operations, maximize the value of their technology investments and establish a resilient, scalable digital ecosystem.
The energy industry stands at a pivotal juncture. While emerging technologies are crucial to the future, their full potential can only be realized through seamless system integration. Companies that prioritize integration can work to more effectively maximize their technology investments and position themselves as leaders in an increasingly competitive landscape.
As the industry continues its digital transformation, I believe those who master the art of system integration will be best positioned to thrive in the energy landscape of tomorrow.

It's not clear how these copies were obtained, but one X/Twitter user posted photos of its box, along with photos and videos of gameplay, claiming that they bought their copy on Facebook Marketplace. Though these posts were removed, they've been saved and widely reshared online. Per TheGamer, auction listings have appeared on sites like Mercari offering copies of the game for $100, which quickly sold. There have also been Twitch streams of Assassin's Creed Shadows, though these have apparently been removed as of this writing.
Ubisoft has acknowledged the early copies on X/Twitter and called for players not to spoil the game for others. It also notes that updates are still in development for launch day, so what you see in leaked gameplay doesn't necessarily reflect how the game will play once it's officially available.
Assassin's Creed Shadows comes at a pivotal time for publisher Ubisoft, which has suffered significant setbacks in recent months, including a large drop in its stock price and rumors that it's looking for a buyer. Assassin's Creed Shadows itself has been delayed numerous times. The details of the game's DLC, Claws of Awaji, were leaked earlier this year on its Steam page, confirming 10 hours of additional gameplay. Note that this DLC is a preorder bonus, and will also be available as a separate purchase later in 2025.

87,2025-02-24,"The M4 MacBook Air was as inevitable as the sunrise. Now, a new report claims itâs close to release. It may not be the dawn of any real MacBook Air revitalization. We suspect it could be nearly as powerful as the M4 MacBook Pro, but at the very least, we can all but guarantee that it will finally include 16 GB of RAM.
Hot off the heels of its iPhone 16e announcement, Apple is gearing up to unleash another, non-â Proâ product in the form of its MacBook Air M4 13 and 15, according to Bloombergâs Mark Gurman in his latest Power On newsletter. According to Gurmanâs anonymous sources, the new Airs could arrive early in March. The Cupertino, California tech giant has already started prepping its marketing teams, all while the company is paring back current M3 MacBook Air stock in Apple stores.
This all checks out, as Apple first unveiled its M3 MacBook Air 13-inch and 15-inch models in March 2024. In our tests, we found the devices were practically on par with the 14-inch MacBook Pro M3 in terms of performance.Â Last week, leaked GeekbenchÂ scores for a âMac16,12â model showed up with Metal graphics benchmark scores close to, but not exactly on par with what we saw in ourÂ tests. MacRumors cited Mac16,12 as one of the supposed MacBook Air models found referenced in macOS 15.2.
This supposed MacBook Air model has a 10-core M4 model with a 4.41 GHz base frequency running alongside 24 GB of RAM. The MacBook Pro M4 scored 57,449 running macOS 15.3 compared to 54,806 on the unverified Mac model on macOS 15.2. It scores much closer to the iPad Pro M4 with its less-capable graphics processing. M4 first debuted with the iPad Pro, and when it came to the MacBook Pro, there was a small but noticeable uptick in performance with the more powerful GPU. The MacBook Pro models have more space for a better cooling solution to the Airs. Still, the next MacBook Air M4 could be closer in specs to the iPad version, but weâll need to wait and see more on that front.
We would be shocked if Apple had any real surprises besides the new chip in store for the MacBook Air. Apple has kept the same design language consistent from the M2 MacBook Air till now, essentially offering the same square, fanless frame as the Pro versions, all still including that damn notch hovering like a stalactite at the top of the display. Perhaps the next MacBook Air may finally allow users to use up to two external displays simultaneously with the lid open rather than closed like on the M3 models. The M4 MacBook Pro with its Thunderbolt 5 connections has that multi-screen capacity, so it would only make sense to bring that to the cheaper, thinner MacBooks.
At the very least, we can expect more memory on the new devices. The M3 MacBook Air sportedÂ  8 GB of RAM at its cheapest price at launch, but things changed with the M4 MacBook Pro, which included 16 GB of RAM at base for no increase in price year-over-year. That memory uptick helps these computers handle more AI processing tasks, something thatâs important to Apple with the advent of Apple Intelligence. Like the iPhone 16e, these devices are going to push AI hard. It will be up to the folks at the end of 1 Infinite Loop to give us a reason we would want to use it at all. As much as Apple is pushing AI with the latest updates to devices like the Vision Pro, weâre still waiting for the one feature that actually changes how we use the companyâs devices.

When I think of B2B marketing, rock ‘n’ roll is far from my mind. But Video Brothers CEO and former touring musician Chandler Quintin brings exactly that to his strategy.
It turns out the skills he built playing Warped Tour and opening for bands like Panic! At the Disco are surprisingly transferable to marketing.
“That kind of experience gives me the charisma to go out there and tell an industry like B2B, 'Hey, you're boring,'” he says. “B2B is having a really hard time standing out and cutting through the noise, so they need a little rock n' roll, right?”

But even the most raucous rockstars have a method to their madness, and Quintin says Video Brothers' method for helping B2B brands stand out is called the ad suite formula.
“One of the principles of the ad suite is bringing people through a journey because people like stories,” he explains. “They like to be entertained. We want them to remember things; the best way to do that is to tell a great story.”
The formula hits all the right notes. According to Quintin, after implementing this formula, Loxo, a Video Brothers client, experienced a 46% increase in quarter-over-quarter revenue and a 25% increase in pipeline growth.
So, what‘s the deal with this ad suite formula? Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:
Step 1: The Teaser Ad
Step 2: The Hero Ad
Step 3: The Follow Ups and Reminders
Bonus Track: The Landing Page
While most marketers get caught up in clicks and conversions, Quintin focuses on what he calls an “attention matrix.”
“Audiences are in this bottom left corner of not knowing who you are and not caring. They're also not going to watch a lot of content,” he says. “Our goal as marketers is to bring them to the top right, where they know who you are, care a lot about what you do, are problem-aware, and possibly solution-aware. Now, they'll watch a lot more content.”
Think of the 15-second teaser as an opener to a live show. It gets the crowd's attention and prepares them for the main act.
“We're not looking for clicks or conversions; we're looking to stop them in their tracks and introduce them to the pain because great marketers market pain,” Quintin says. “They don't market solutions.”
In the teaser ad Video Brothers created for Loxo, the problem is a recruiter trying to find the most elusive candidate yet — Bigfoot!
It's short, snappy, funny, and exciting.
The teaser ties the problem to the brand and spotlights the business as the solution.
And in a world where viewers like me struggle to muscle through even 10 seconds of ads, Quintin says it‘s okay if audiences don’t get through the teaser. The ad will just run again.
“We don't want to be afraid of showing the same ad twice because the ads are fun. People actually want to watch them,” he says. ""The idea is to start warming the audience up, so we capture them with a teaser ad, we retarget them with a teaser ad again to get them to a higher viewer intent.""
And once the crowd is warmed up, it's time for the headliner: the hero ad.
If you've been to a concert, you know the headliner usually has the longest set. The same goes for hero ads in the ad suite formula.
The hero ad is about 30 seconds long and is a stand-alone, front-to-back narrative that introduces the problem and solidifies the brand as the solution.
“It's all done in this memorable, fun environment,” Quintin says.
Loxo‘s hero ad is an excellent example. The recruiters are looking for Bigfoot as a job candidate. Of course, Bigfoot isn’t easy to find. Notice how the ad shows the recruiters discussing the tools Loxo provides to lead them to Bigfoot.
Okay, you‘ve seen the opener and the headliner. That must mean the show’s over, right? Nope! It's time for the encore.
After the hero ad gives the audience the full story, they're treated to follow-up and reminder ads. The follow-up ad shows the positive transformation the brand provides and gives the audience closure regarding the story.
In the Loxo follow-up below, we see the recruiters finally reached Bigfoot via video call and are preparing to send him to the hiring manager.
The story may be over, but the work isn't. Video Brothers will roll out reminder ads to stay top of mind with the audience.
“The reminder ad plays into the psychology of needing reminders and signs to see things,” Quintin says. “You'll tune out a lot of information in your day-to-day life, but signs will stand out to you.”
Reminder ads are about 6 seconds long. Like stop signs and green lights, they convey one action the brand wants the audience to take. That action could be to make a call, book an appointment, or visit the brand's website.
“Think of reminder ads as video billboards where you could be scrolling by it fast, but because your brain recognizes the patterns from the prior ads, you know subconsciously that you're seeing ads from that company,” Quintin explains.
If the audience sees the ads enough, they‘ll eventually become curious enough to research your brand or visit your website. Just make sure your website isn’t a letdown.
I can‘t tell you how many times I’ve gone to a concert, fallen in love with a band, and then decided to visit their merch table, only to be underwhelmed by the items there.
No business wants its audience to be disappointed by a bland website, which is why Quintin says the visual aspects of the ad suite formula are crucial.
“The one thing a lot of marketers get wrong is that they'll have these awesome ads and send someone to a boring landing page with a form-fill,” he explains. “You were just entertaining them, and now you're baiting and switching them by bringing them to some boring website to ask for information.""
To avoid this problem, Video Brothers clients often have themed landing pages to continue the fun. For example, the ad suite for Act, another Video Brothers client, plays out like a Law & Order episode.
“There's an investigation, the characters are looking at a small business owner's office, and there's chaos everywhere,” Quintin says. “They don't even promote their domain. They don't say, 'Visit us at Act.com.' They go to 'SolveMyChaos.com.”
At SolveMyChaos.com, visitors see a mysterious landing page that reads, “The investigation continues.” The site keeps the mystery/crime theme while showing how the business solves its customers' problems.
The point of the ad suite formula is to make your brand memorable and to delight your audience from beginning to end.
“If you're not memorable, you're not going to be the first thought when it's time for that audience to solve their pain,” Quintin says. “And if you're not their first thought, you're rarely going to be on their day-one consideration list, and then you won't win any of the races that you're in.”

89,2025-02-24,"So many accessories for MagSafe revolve around charging, docking, etc. Some of them are not technology-related but work with an analog approach. The MOFT Action Inspiration is an awesome product for those who love sticky notes but need something on the go.

					Abode is the best home security system and includes compatibility with HomeKit.				
MagSafe Monday: Every Monday, Bradley Chambers looks at the latest and greatest in the MagSafe and wireless charging industry to help you get the most out of your Apple devices that support wireless charging.
The MOFT Action Inspiration is one of those products you didn’t know you wanted until you had it. The package includes a wallet, stand, a very small pen, and a notepad. The pen, especially, is really interesting. It’s a feather-light tri-folding magnetic pen that essentially disappears in the product when it’s not being used. It’s as close to a flat as you can get. Notepad-wise, it includes a pack of sticky notes as well as a traditional notepad. 
If you’re the type of person who likes to carry around paper and pen but doesn’t want the bulkiness of a bigger notebook, this is the product for you. Because it snaps onto the back of your iPhone, you won’t feel like you’re carrying around something extra. It can carry some cards, but it’s not ideal for more than a couple in my opinion. If you want a MagSafe wallet, there are better options on the market.
I am using it to replace my grocery list in an Apple Note. I find it much easier to cross off a simple list versus unlocking my phone, opening the app, etc. If you work in an office, it’s big enough to take simple meeting notes, etc. You can then scan the note into Apple Notes if you want to digitize it later. 

					Upgrade your doors with Apple Home Key and the Aqara U50.				
Another cool use case is it can function as a stand as well. So, in 1 MagSafe accessory, you get:
In a time in my life when I need a little less screen time, I am really enjoying the MOFT Action Inspiration. You can buy it from Amazon. You can also buy refill packets for the paper when you run out.

90,2025-02-24,"Industrial designer Gustav Rosén and business partner David Lindell recently launched Kord, a Swedish design brand. Their stock-in-trade, at least to start, is power. ""We saw an opportunity to take something as common as power strips,"" says Lindell, ""and give them a distinct presence and design that feels natural in both homes and other environments. There are few products in this segment that deliver both function and aesthetics – and we wanted to fill that gap.""
Their inaugural product is the Cuboid, a diminutive power strip—sorry, cube—with four outlets. A Cuboid+ variant features three outlets and two USB-C ports.
 
 

 
Both models come with a 2-meter cord, and the company bills them as the smallest multi-socket power strips in the world.



They're also offering this optional Cumulus Case, which seeks to ""[transform] the Cuboid into a sculptural object."" To me this seems a strange choice, one that actively works against purposefulness of the existing design.
 
 
At press time, the recently-launced venture had yet to announce when they're going into production and where these will be available.

91,2025-02-24,"Long established as an investment-friendly powerhouse in global real estate, Dubai has consistently embraced luxury and innovation. In recent years, the world’s most dynamic marketplace has further solidified its pioneering status by capitalizing on the evolving opportunities presented by digitalization and cryptocurrency.
By adopting a proactive approach to these emerging technologies, Dubai has cultivated an environment where high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) and ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWIs) can reap the benefits of enhanced security and efficiency. These advantages are particularly evident when leveraging digital assets to diversify wealth into real estate investments.
Dubai city center
As the CEO of Unique Properties, I have witnessed firsthand how real estate consultancy firms like ours have become instrumental in guiding foreign investors through Dubai’s digital property landscape. At Unique Properties, we offer seamless support and specialist advice, assisting with everything from converting volatile cryptocurrencies into stable assets to managing investments remotely. Our services are designed to provide the expertise needed to make Dubai a second home for international buyers.
According to the Henley & Partners Crypto Wealth Report, 30% of Dubai’s UHNWIs now hold crypto assets. In response to this growing trend, luxury real estate developers in the region are increasingly accepting Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies. By embracing blockchain technology, developers are aiming to eliminate cross-border transaction hurdles and reduce reliance on traditional banking systems. This shift has created a more efficient, and secure environment for conducting business.
Accepting cryptocurrencies in the real estate market goes beyond catering to new forms of currency and satisfying the desires of investors who wish to use them. Crypto-friendly developers also gain a competitive edge by facilitating quick and tax-efficient international investments, ensuring smoother transactions for global buyers. Additionally, the fully transparent verification process offered by blockchain technology allows buyers to enjoy enhanced anonymity without compromising security. For a growing cohort of digital asset investors, companies that facilitate these benefits are becoming increasingly attractive.
 
Digital technology is transforming not only how investments and transactions are made, but also the very nature of real estate opportunities. Some of the unprecedented advancements include:
While the high-growth potential of cryptocurrencies is appealing, its value can be extremely volatile. Converting digital assets into more stable real estate allows investors to hedge against uncertainty by diversifying their wealth portfolios. This strategy is particularly advantageous in high-yield markets such as Dubai and the UAE. Balancing digital and traditional asset classes through crypto-based real estate investment trusts (REITs) offers a middle ground between strong returns and manageable risks.
The opportunities generated by digitalization and cryptocurrency in the world’s most luxurious real estate market are significant. However, navigating this rapidly evolving landscape can present challenges. Real estate consultancies play a pivotal role in simplifying the investment process by bridging the gap between developers and buyers.
 
Since 2008, Unique Properties has been a forward-thinking leader in the Dubai market. I am proud to say that our award-winning firm is ideally positioned to assist with all aspects of real estate investment. This includes handling documentation, crypto transactions, and compliance procedures, as well as offering insights into market trends, portfolio optimization, and risk management in an increasingly digital environment.
Beyond consultancy, we provide guidance on acquiring UAE residency and visas through property investment, seamless management services, and end-to-end transaction support for international investors in the Dubai market.
Dubai’s luxury real estate market is not just about prime locations and breathtaking views — it is about pioneering new ways to invest in the future. The UAE’s commitment to adopting crypto and digitalization is reshaping the industry, offering borderless, high-speed investments in a fast-growing, high-yield market.
Combined with its strategic geographical location and investor-friendly environment, Dubai’s crypto-friendly developers and digital-first investment strategies are positioning the city as a global leader in next-generation real estate transactions. At Unique Properties, we are proud to contribute to this evolution by offering our expertise and innovative solutions, helping Dubai maintain its status as the global benchmark for cutting-edge real estate opportunities."

Stocks are climbing a wall of worry, which is a hallmark of bull markets. Higher equity prices really do require fear.
Here, we’ll highlight the least-liked stocks on Wall Street. Why? Because each analyst has nothing to do but upgrade these plays from here. As always, we’ll focus on big dividends—I’m talking about yields starting at 6% and going all the way up to 24%.
While retail investors are fearful, analysts at large are quite bullish. At least on paper.
Professional stock analysts are optimistic by default. They know exactly who butters their bread, so it’s hard to make a living by unabashedly slamming most of their coverage universe.
How optimistic are we talking? As I write this, nearly 400 of the S&P 500’s companies have consensus Buy ratings. And virtually all of the rest are merely considered Holds. In fact, right now, only a single S&P 500 component is considered a Sell by Wall Street’s brightest minds.
We contrarians prefer stocks with Sell ratings. When this happens, there are nothing but upgrades to follow.
Let’s begin with Franklin Resources (BEN, 6.1% yield). Better known for its operating business, Franklin Templeton, this isn’t just one of the world’s largest investment managers—it’s a Dividend Aristocrat with 44 years of payout hikes under its belt, including a raise just a couple of months ago. While BEN has a lot more Hold calls than Sell calls, it doesn’t have a single Buy rating to its name, and that’s still extremely bearish for the analyst set.
Why did Franklin Resources draw my attention? Because it was a little less than five years ago that I lumped it in with a few other “zombie dividends” that were “probably dead money at best.”
The problem back then? Net outflows. The problem today? Net outflows. But the story has changed – today, outflows are being heavily driven by Franklin-owned fixed-income manager Western Asset Management Co. unit, whose star bond manager, Ken Leech, has been charged with fraud. WAMCO has suffered massive redemptions from the likes of the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, Ohio’s Bureau of Workers’ Compensation and the Chicago Teachers’ Pension Fund.
Franklin is working on expense reductions. It actually has a promising, growing alternatives business. And it still saw fit to upgrade its dividend at the end of 2024. There’s not nothing here. But given the low visibility into when exactly the WAMCO-related bleeding will stop, it’s no surprise the pros have little appetite for this Aristocrat right now.
Less scandal-plagued is Suburban Propane Partners, LP (SPH, 5.9% yield), a national propane supplier that serves more than 700 communities in 42 states. The view from 10,000 feet isn’t exactly attractive—this master limited partnership’s units have been cut by 60% since 2011 amid a volatile longer-term downtrend in the price of propane. The stock is not heavily covered by Wall Street, but it’s a polarizing play that sports twice as many Sell calls as Buy ratings, and not a single Hold.
The pros might be spurred into action. I last discussed SPH in the back half of 2023, saying that a return to colder weather and a heightened interest in yield should drive interest in the propane stock, and indeed it did. Shares have delivered a total return of 60% since then, including a big pop to start 2025 on the back of cold snaps across the U.S. and resurgent propane prices.
But the risk/reward picture has gotten blurrier—SPH’s yield is much less than it was in 2023 (~9% then vs. ~6% now) and coverage is tighter, at about 70%-85% across a range of expected earnings for this year.
BGS Foods (BGS, 12.1% yield) is a smallish consumer-staples name with a few well-known brands that include Crisco, Cream of Wheat, Ortega, and Bear Creek. And it’s an example of how to get a bigger yield the wrong way.
BGS’s yield has rocketed from below 9% in early November to north of 12% right now—without a dividend hike. Instead, we can chalk it up to a 33% stock drop triggered by a dreadful Q3 earnings report and guidance cut.
Analysts are more cautious than outright hostile toward BGS, but five Holds and two Sells against no Buys is still a plenty-bearish consensus. The pros expect 2024 to end with a thud (profits down 30% to an adjusted 69 cents per share), followed by a flat-to-down 2025 (67 cents).
This could be a real problem for the dividend, given that at current levels, BGS pays out 76 cents.
I’m going to briefly mention Prospect Capital (PSEC, 12.1% yield) because it needs saying: We have repeatedly warned about PSEC here, including in October 2024—just a couple of weeks before it announced yet another dividend cut. This time, it hacked away 25% of its monthly payout, bringing it from 6 cents to 4.5 cents per share.
Prospect Capital comes up in a lot of investor screens because it’s perpetually cheap (57% of NAV right now) and, despite all the cuts, it almost always sports an eye-popping yield (12%+ right now). I wouldn’t directly bet against it—I think the administration could be favorable for business development companies like PSEC—but I agree with Wall Street, which has the stock as consensus Sell.
I couldn’t pass up the chance to talk about a 20%-yielder, which is what we have in ZIM Integrated Shipping Services (ZIM, 24.2% yield). Israel-based ZIM is a global container liner shipping company that serves more than 32,000 customers across 300 ports in 90 countries. It’s also a relatively young public issue—the company launched its IPO roughly four years ago.
But Wall Street thinks that’s just about enough. Five Sells against two Holds and no Buys? That’s about as bearish as they get. It’s not for nothing: Container spot rates are falling, and the outlook remains negative, in part because tariffs could depress international cargo demand. Also worrisome? ZIM has been ramping up capital investments, which has resulted in net debt spiking from a little more than $1 billion in 2022 to $3.5 billion today. ZIM is only worth $2.4 billion by market cap.
Shipping stocks are extremely cyclical, too—it’s not unusual for stocks in this space to collapse by 50% or more before bouncing back. So while the pros see a massive downturn coming for ZIM, that could just be par for the course before the next cycle whisks the stock higher again. Which is why would-be dividend dip buyers should know exactly what they’re in for.
ZIM technically has a quarterly dividend policy, in which it will distribute “on a quarterly basis at a rate of 30% of the net quarterly income of each of the first three fiscal quarters of the year, while the cumulative annual dividend amount to be distributed by the Company (including the interim dividends paid during the first three fiscal quarters of the year) will total 30-50% of the annual net income.”
But ZIM paid three dividends in 2024, including a special-and-regular distribution in December. It paid just once in 2023. And as the chart shows, how much it pays is all over the place.

[+] philanthropist and influential business people featured on the Forbes list of 100 Greatest Business Minds during the Forbes Media Centennial Celebration at Pier 60 on September 19, 2017 in New York City.  (Photo by Daniel Zuchnik/WireImage)
Warren Buffett released his 2024 annual shareholder letter on Saturday, drawing the immediate attention of investors and business leaders worldwide. As stakeholders parsed the document for insights into Berkshire Hathaway’s condition, they were rewarded with the wisdom that has made Buffett a legendary figure in finance. This marks the 60th year of Berkshire under his leadership, with the conglomerate’s market cap now exceeding $1.1 trillion. While its unprecedented success is evident, the intellectual architects who shaped Buffett's investment philosophy deserve recognition for their contributions to this remarkable legacy.
Benjamin Graham, widely regarded as the father of value investing, provided Buffett with his fundamental understanding of markets. Graham's essential principle—that purchasing a stock means acquiring partial ownership in a business—revolutionized Buffett's market approach. Rather than seeing stocks as tradable securities, Graham taught Buffett to analyze the underlying business and determine its intrinsic value. This perspective enabled Buffett to look beyond market volatility and make decisions based on business fundamentals rather than price fluctuations.
While Graham supplied Buffett's value foundation, Philip Fisher introduced him to the critical importance of comprehensive research and high-quality businesses. Fisher's ""scuttlebutt"" methodology—collecting intelligence about companies from diverse sources including competitors, suppliers, and customers—became integral to Buffett's research process. Fisher's emphasis on identifying companies with sustainable competitive advantages, or ""moats,"" significantly influenced Buffett's gravitation toward businesses with enduring market positions and pricing power.
Ed Thorpe contributed two vital elements to Buffett's investment approach: survival prioritization and strategic concentration. Thorpe's principle that investors must first ensure survival before pursuing returns helped shape Buffett's disciplined risk-management philosophy. Additionally, Thorpe's strategy of making concentrated investments when possessing a clear advantage reinforced Buffett's comfort with portfolio concentration. This influenced his willingness to make substantial commitments when identifying exceptional opportunities, rather than diluting returns through excessive diversification.
No individual has influenced Buffett's evolution as an investor more profoundly than Charlie Munger. Munger guided Buffett's transition from Graham's strict value approach toward focusing on exceptional businesses available at reasonable prices. He particularly emphasized the power of companies that could transform commodities into branded products commanding premium margins. Munger's influence led to Buffett's iconic investments in companies like Coca-Cola, where brand strength and operational efficiency created durable competitive advantages.
Geico’s Leo Goodwin, Capital Cities/ABC's Tom Murphy, Teledyne's Henry Singleton, and Fastenal's Robert Kierlin exemplify the exceptional executives who shaped Buffett's appreciation for superior leadership. Murphy's disciplined capital allocation at Capital Cities/ABC, Singleton's pioneering share repurchase strategy at Teledyne, and Kierlin's innovative distribution approach at Fastenal demonstrated how skilled management could generate extraordinary shareholder value through different methodologies. Their collective influence taught Buffett the importance of identifying and backing talented leaders capable of building enduring cultures of excellence. This appreciation for exceptional management has guided his preference for retaining successful leadership teams after Berkshire acquisitions, allowing them to continue creating value with minimal interference.

The collective wisdom of these mentors transformed Buffett from a pure value investor into a more sophisticated practitioner focused on business quality, competitive durability, and extraordinary management. Their teachings emphasized that successful investing requires more than identifying undervalued stocks—it demands understanding business fundamentals, conducting thorough research, managing risk effectively, recognizing quality, and backing superior leadership. These principles have not only directed Buffett’s personal success but have become the foundation of Berkshire Hathaway's enduring investment philosophy and exceptional market performance over six decades."
97,2025-02-24,"Walter Carpenter walks across the ski resort’s dining room on a knee that needs to be replaced and a hip that’s going bad. Lumbering into the kitchen, he deposits a brown bin of dirty dishes on a counter before heading back out to collect more bowls of half-eaten tomato soup and plates littered with sandwich crusts. “One foot in front of the other,” he jokes to kitchen prep worker Kim Hopper, 72, as they pass each other.
Carpenter, 69, has worked winters at the Mad River Glen ski area in Waitsfield, Vt., for the past 15 years. Four times a week, he clocks in around noon, and makes $20 per hour carrying dishes up and down the three flights of stairs in the “base box,” as the kitchen and bar area is called, putting plastic food baskets and metal tongs and soup ladles in their rightful place, loading the industrial dishwasher with cups and bowls. He has peripheral neuropathy, which can leave him without feeling in his feet or legs. Some days, his phone tells him, he walks more than five miles during his shifts.
He never thought he’d be on the job at this age, but without much in retirement savings, Carpenter has no plans to stop. “I’m broke and poor and still working at 69,” he says as he once again ascends the carpeted gray stairs with a bin full of dishes, his shoulders slightly stooped, his gray mustache and hair hidden under a baseball cap, a scruffy Einstein with a slight Boston accent. “But at least I’m still here.”
Mad River Glen, where a daily adult lift ticket costs $115, couldn’t run without staffers like Carpenter. If you include part-timers on the ski patrol, the kitchen crew, and the employees at the retail shop, about half its workers are over 65, according to marketing coordinator Ry Young. That’s not entirely surprising in Vermont, where about 26% of residents 65 and older are still working—the highest share in the U.S. The state is at the forefront of a national trend: as birth rates decline and the country ages, older people are staying in the workforce longer. Today, about 19% of people 65 and older in the U.S. are still working, up from 10% four decades ago.
They do it for a variety of reasons. Some, like John Mandeville, 75, the executive director of the Central Vermont Council on Aging, find fulfillment from their jobs and want to keep going until they can’t anymore. Others, like Hopper, the prep cook, have ample retirement savings but still want to be around people, and work part time to stay connected. But about half of workers 65 and older are people like Carpenter, according to Craig Copeland, director of wealth-benefits research at the Employee Benefit Research Institute. For one reason or another—an illness, an investment scam, a lifetime of jobs without a pension or means to save for retirement—they have no choice but to keep working to pay the bills.
For these people, the finish line can feel miles away, and every time it draws closer, something moves it back again. Maybe they thought they could get by with their retirement savings until inflation started climbing. Or perhaps they were on track to quit at 65 until the stock market took a dive. Many are like Carpenter, who has worked for 55 years, doing construction, picking apples, running ski lifts, and managing parking lots, but can’t retire because most of his jobs were low-paying, with meager benefits.
There will likely be more of these Americans in the years to come. Half of babies born in the U.S. in 2007 are projected to live to 103, according to the World Economic Forum. As lifespans lengthen, wages are not keeping up with inflation, and even a decent nest egg may not go far enough. That’s especially true as employers have shifted the burden of retirement savings to employees, offering 401(k)s rather than pensions that promise a certain benefit every month. As a result, millions of Americans are going to have to keep working longer. “The issue more than anything is the high cost of living,” says Mandeville, the Council on Aging director. “It’s really strained people’s retirement budgets.”
The growing class of people who want to stop working, but can’t, represents a crack in a social compact that assured citizens who worked hard that they could take it easy when they hit 65, if not before. As that crack grows, it will put economic strain on younger generations who have to care for family members, contributing to a growing burden of debt that includes student loans and homeownership. Retirement savings will become one more discouraging thing that young workers can’t afford as their costs grow but their wages do not. Forty years ago, a teacher or a municipal worker or an employee on a manufacturing line was guaranteed a good retirement after putting their time in. Today, more people are working in service-industry jobs, but longtime workers like Walter Carpenter cannot afford retirement. “I just have to keep working,” he says as he clears away dirty dishes. “Right now, retirement is a distant dream.”
In the mornings, Carpenter sits down at a desk in his rent-subsidized apartment in downtown Montpelier and writes letters. He sends missives to newspaper editors about the need for single-payer health care, the problems with the private insurance market, and the importance of gun control. Evidence of his political advocacy adorns the otherwise bare walls of his spartan apartment. There’s a picture of him with Senator Bernie Sanders taken on the steps of the Vermont state capitol; a letter from former Senator Patrick Leahy; a commendation from former Governor Peter Shumlin. Carpenter spends hours sitting at his big desk, the main piece of furniture in his couchless living room, writing about the flaws of the American economy. “What will happen when, as a friend so aptly put it, I become ‘too frail to work and too poor to live?’” he wrote in one 2017 letter advocating for state-sponsored retirement benefits.
Carpenter became a health care advocate in 2006, he says, after he became seriously ill from a liver disease caused by gallstones in the bile ducts. His health-insurance company wouldn’t preapprove blood work and radiology tests that were needed to figure out what was wrong, he recalls, forcing him to spend hours and hours on the phone with them, advocating for his own treatment. The illness forced him to take a 12-week absence from his job at Stowe Mountain Resort, which was owned by a different company than it is now. He’d worked there since 1995, in a series of jobs that had health insurance and a 401(k) and paid $10 to $12 per hour—not a huge sum, but well above a state minimum wage that sat at $7 at the time. But when Carpenter was ready to return to work, he says, the company had gone through a restructuring, and his job was gone. He applied for other full-time gigs with benefits, but no one seemed to want to hire a 52-year-old man with a history of health problems.
When people lose good jobs in their 50s, it’s common for them to struggle in their 60s and in retirement, says Lisa Berkman, a professor of public policy and epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who has studied older workers. The 50s are a fork decade professionally, Berkman says. Around half of Americans are not working full time throughout them, and the odds of those people being able to find good jobs in their 60s are low. In contrast, about 80% of people who work full time through their 50s go on to work in their 60s. “When you get to be 60, all the inequality that has accumulated over your lifetime comes into Technicolor,” Berkman says.
So it has been for Carpenter. Since his illness, he has been a seasonal worker, spending winters at Mad River Glen and summers at Vermont’s Waterbury Center State Park, where he is a park attendant for $22 an hour. The pay isn’t bad, but the cost of living in Vermont is higher than the national average. Even with a rent-subsidized apartment, Carpenter’s finances are tight. There’s the $235 he has to pay monthly for his Medicare supplement, and the $184 deducted from Social Security for Medicare Part B, plus hundreds of dollars on groceries, his cell-phone bill, and expenses for his car, which he drives about 50 miles per day to get to and from work in the winter. The salt does a number on the undercarriage of his 2015 Subaru Forester. One year he had to dip into his retirement savings to get it in shape for its annual inspection.
Carpenter’s situation may sound like bad luck, but it’s a reality for many older Americans. About 1 in 5 people over 50 have no retirement savings at all, according to the AARP. The problem is getting worse over time. A 2023 government survey found that 20% of low-income workers had a retirement-account balance in 2007, but only 10% had one in 2019.
Carpenter has had a colorful life—a self-identified hippie, he’s studied the flute at the Berklee College of Music, taken trains across Canada, lived in Israel, and survived the eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington State. The hospitality industry found him when he moved back to the East Coast to care for his aging father, a professor, and started working odd jobs. This, too, is a common problem: as more people are thrust into caregiving for aging parents, they’ll either have to spend much-needed money for that care or scale back their own work, compromising their fragile finances even further.
Carpenter sometimes wishes he’d thought about retirement earlier, back when he was traveling the world and working part-time jobs. It can be hard sometimes to go to events like his high school reunion and see old schoolmates who are retired and financially secure. He’s worried about what will happen over the next decade. That’s why he scrimps and saves now, eating the half-priced food at Mad River Glen whenever he can, subsisting on deli meat from the kitchen. “There’s going to be a time when I can’t do this anymore,” Carpenter says, wiping his hands on the dirty rag tucked into his pants. “So for now, I have to save as much as I can.”
The sun is setting at Mad River Glen one December evening, and the cafeteria is closing. Customers clomp across the vast dining room in their ski boots, ready to go home. In the kitchen, things are slowing down; workers mop the floor as a boom box blasts the Grateful Dead. Carpenter tosses a green bag of sopping compost into a bin, then bends over to pick up a black plastic bag filled with trash. “You have to know how to lift things in this job,” he says, gesturing to the rolling cart full of trash bags and compost.
Donning his jacket, he rolls the cart to the elevator, takes it to the ground floor, and drags it outside. It’s about 10°, but Carpenter is cheerful as he hoists the trash, recycling, and compost, and tosses them in the proper bins. It is a job for a younger person. When it eventually becomes too difficult, he may ask to become a cashier like his colleague Ron Anderson, 81, who retired from a career in advertising decades ago, then decided to come back to work for camaraderie and the free lift ticket given to all employees.
As the nation ages, workers like Carpenter and Anderson will play a greater role in the economy. The Census Bureau predicts that the 65-and-older population in the U.S. will leap from 58 million in 2022 to 82 million by 2050, when the group is projected to make up more than a quarter of the country’s population. The share of people in the workforce who are 55 and older is growing, while the proportion of people 16 to 54 has been shrinking since the late 1990s, according to a recent report by the Employee Benefit Research Institute. Older workers are becoming more prevalent as the youngest contributors to the economy—people 16 to 24—no longer work as often as they once did, instead pursuing school or other interests.
With its high proportion of older workers, Mad River Glen—and the state it serves—offer a glimpse of America’s future. Vermont is the third oldest state in the nation; the number of residents 65 and older has nearly doubled during the past two decades, according to the Vermont State Data Center. The cost of living deters some people from moving here and often sends locals in search of an exit. As employers report worker shortages, state officials are beginning to look for ways to support older workers willing to fill the gaps, says Mandeville, the 75-year-old Council on Aging director. 
That’s how a business like the Trapp Family Lodge, a resort in Stowe, Vt., came to put out an ad in 2022 that targeted retirees: “Are you retired and looking for a part-time job to get you out of the house/make play money?” it asked. Bob Schwartz, the resort’s marketing director, said the idea came as management looked for the “low-hanging fruit to beef up our workforce.”
Flexibility is one of the biggest demands from older workers, says Jena Trombly, director of human resources at the Clara Martin Center, a nonprofit mental-health facility in Vermont. The center has cobbled together a staff by hiring many older people for part-time jobs, agreeing to give them ample time off to travel or visit their grandkids. The center has kept on some longtime workers by allowing them to transfer from full time to part time, keeping their knowledge in the organization. “It’s a win-win all the way around,” she says.
Japan is a good model for what America might look like if its workforce is increasingly made up of older people. About 80% of Japanese workers want to continue their jobs after retirement, according to the World Economic Forum, and about 1 in 4 people 65 and older were still working in 2022. The country has encouraged companies to help by employing older workers and raising the mandatory retirement age above 60. Technology helps too. Some companies have used robots to help elderly workers continue at jobs that their bodies might not otherwise be able to do.
But having everyone work longer isn’t the only option. A new type of savings plan spreading around the U.S. could help more people put aside money for retirement. Called an auto-IRA, the plan sets aside money from people’s paychecks, which it then invests in stocks and bonds. The program costs employers nothing; their only responsibility is to inform workers about it. “This means that people who, for the most part, never had a chance to save can do so,” says David John, a senior policy adviser to the AARP who helped invent the concept. Vermont passed a law allowing auto-IRAs in 2023, and 17 other states either have operational auto-IRAs or are putting plans in place. In some states, like California, almost all employers have to participate.
The program appears to be helping workers grow their retirement savings in the states where it’s already operational, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts. More than a million people have amassed more than $1 billion in assets through such plans since 2018, according to John. In one Pew survey, nearly two-thirds of low-wage workers participating in an auto-IRA plan in Illinois said they were satisfied with it.
Walter Carpenter supports the idea. In one of his letter--writing campaigns in 2017, he penned a missive to the online publication VTDigger advocating for Vermont to support state-sponsored retirement plans. In the letter, Carpenter referred to himself as “someone who knows what it means to lose any hope of retirement through circumstances beyond my control.” 
Employers in Vermont can now start offering this type of plan. But unfortunately, Carpenter is unable to avail himself of the benefits now. It’s too late for the contributions he’d make at this point to amount to much. He reflects on this as he sits in the basement staff dressing room at Mad River Glen, pulling off his apron, swapping his work boots for snow boots and his jeans and sweatshirt for something clean. 
“Someone who has worked for 55 years like me should be able to retire,” he says. Instead, he keeps going—one foot in front of the other. He’s cleaned the kitchen counters with dish soap, taken out the trash, and stacked chairs on tables. He’s ready to go home for the night. But he’ll be back tomorrow, and for many days after that.

98,2025-02-24,"Theresa Neil, a top designer in tech and founder of Femovate, a global femtech incubator.
 
In 1976, a small company called Genentech opened in the San Francisco Bay Area. Considered the first genetic engineering company, Genentech, one of the creators of recombinant DNA technology, has since gone on to become a household name for isolating the genes for human insulin, growth hormone and more. It all started with a vision and some careful investments that helped pave the way for world-changing technology and science.
Following the model that made San Francisco's ""Biotech Bay"" successful since Genentech's founding, women's health biotech companies are creating next-generation therapeutics and therapies, building robust patent portfolios and providing hope to female patients looking for solutions for chronic health conditions, diseases and more. While there have been concerns about underinvestment in the sector, recent reports suggest investors recognize the industry as an untapped opportunity.
It's been a long path to get to this point. For decades, women's health research was dramatically underfunded, with less than 5% of biopharmaceutical research dollars targeting female-specific conditions.
But that's changing as venture capital firms and biotech investors begin to recognize an overlooked trillion-dollar opportunity: precise, biology-based solutions for women's health. New funds are emerging to accelerate innovation, from the Melinda Gates Action for Women's Health fund to the American Heart Association's Go Red For Women initiative. The market potential is so compelling that even the federal government is following suit, with ARPA-H committing $110 million to accelerate innovation in the space.
The shift toward biotech solutions in women's health isn't just about scientific advancement—it's about creating sustainable, scalable businesses backed by robust ecosystems. It's also about creating a new sector that provides women hope for healthcare, chronic conditions and more. As successful biotech hubs like Boston and San Francisco have demonstrated, combining scientific talent, capital access and established infrastructure creates powerful advantages.
Rather than competing for existing market share, many biotech solutions are creating entirely new markets. Some companies are even developing new categories of treatment that could expand the market for women's health solutions. Here are three sections that I think hold the most promise—both in terms of healthcare and marketing opportunities.
Many women's health companies are pioneering new diagnostic approaches that will transform disease detection and treatment.
For example, Smart Blood Analytics is leading this charge with their universal diagnostic platform that analyzes blood test results through the lens of biological sex and age. Meanwhile, ARPA-H, as part of the White House's Sprint for Women's Health, has backed Nura Health to develop a diagnostic blood test and personalized treatment platform for endometriosis. (Disclosure: I have provided pro-bono services to Nura Health.)
Companies are leveraging AI and machine learning to expand the realm of what's possible in early screening and diagnosis of women's health issues.
Femtech companies are also developing new therapeutics that provide novel solutions to increasing women's health span.
Celmatix is pioneering therapeutics to extend healthy ovarian function and lifespan, addressing fundamental aspects of women's reproductive health. And Gameto is developing novel ovarian therapy to prevent disease in menopause, targeting one of the most universal yet underserved aspects of women's health, while the University of Iowa is advancing ovarian cancer treatment using personalized nanoparticles that leverage a woman's immune system.
Finally, companies are creating new treatments for health conditions, diseases and aging. Traditional drug delivery methods often ignore female anatomy and physiology. The Wyss Institute is developing an implantable lymphoid organ as a breakthrough therapy for late-stage and metastasized ovarian cancer.
The women's health biotech sector is gaining validation beyond venture capital as established pharmaceutical companies recognize the expanding market opportunity. Major industry players are starting to view women's health as a primary market rather than a niche segment.
For investors and business leaders exploring the women's health space, the path to success requires a different approach from traditional biotech. I've found the most promising companies are those running parallel tracks, building revenue through early-stage solutions like diagnostics or data platforms while advancing their breakthrough therapeutics. This isn't just about financial sustainability, these companies are building valuable real-world datasets that inform their broader research and development work.
Beyond the usual metrics of IP and clinical trials, the successful companies will likely be the ones that truly understand women's healthcare journeys. Look for strong advisory boards that include female healthcare providers and patients, and meaningful partnerships with existing healthcare networks. The most promising opportunities aren't just about better treatments, they're about fundamentally reimagining how women access healthcare and participate in their careplans. And just like Genentech did for biotech, these companies aren't just creating products, they're building entirely new categories.
As we enter 2025, the confluence of scientific advancement, market opportunity and industry validation suggests women's health biotech is approaching an inflection point similar to what we saw with Genentech and the broader biotech industry. Those early biotech investments led to transformational scientific breakthroughs and created enormous value.
Today's investments in women's health innovation appear poised to follow a similar trajectory, not just changing healthcare outcomes, but in reshaping our understanding of what's possible in women's health.
