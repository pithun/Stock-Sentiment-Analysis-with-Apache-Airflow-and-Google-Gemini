0,2025-10-14,"The UK is set to be the second-fastest-growing of the world's most advanced economies this year, according to new projections from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
But the IMF also predicts the UK will face the highest rate of inflation among G7 nations both this year and next, driven by rising energy and utility bills.
The forecasts are part of the Fund's twice-a-year outlook for the global economy.
It said so far there had been a ""muted response"" to the wave of tariffs imposed on imports to the US this year, but that they were having an impact on global growth.
The IMF, whose purpose is to bring its 190 members together to work on maintaining global economic stability, is a respected forecaster. However, uncertainties, ranging from geopolitics to the weather, often derail expectations.
According to the Fund's latest predictions, unveiled as government officials gather in Washington DC, the UK appears to be weathering the storm better than others.
The IMF predicts that in 2025 the UK economy will outperform other G7 economies, apart from the US, in what has been a torrid year for trade and geopolitical tensions.
The G7 are a grouping of the world's richer countries, including the US, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, the UK and Japan, but not fast-growing economies such as India and China.
Despite edging ahead of most rivals, UK economic growth rates are expected to remain modest at 1.3% for this year and next.
Moreover, on a per head basis economic output is only set to grow 0.4% this year and 0.5% in 2026, putting the UK at the bottom of the G7 league table.
Chancellor Rachel Reeves who arrived in Washington on Tuesday, said people sensed the economy was ""stuck"".
""Working people feel it every day, experts talk about it, and I am going to deal with it,"" she said.
She will use the IMF gathering to try to provide reassurance over the UK's financial stability and tout the country as an attractive place for investment.
However the IMF warned the UK still faces stronger inflation than in other similar countries, with prices forecast to rise by 3.4% this year and 2.5% in 2026. The IMF said higher inflation was likely to be temporary, and should fall to 2% by the end of next year.
Speaking at a separate event in Washington, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said he also believed inflationary pressures were easing, after unemployment data in the UK on Tuesday showed unemployment rising and wage growth slowing.
Highlighting the inflation forecasts, shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride said the IMF assessment made for ""grim reading"".
He said UK households were ""being squeezed from all sides"", adding: ""Since taking office, Labour have allowed the cost of living to rise, debt to balloon and business confidence to collapse to record lows.""
The IMF's global outlook was dominated by the reaction to US tariffs, a weakened dollar, questions about the independence of the US Federal Reserve and sky-high valuations of US tech companies, the Fund said.
The IMF said resilience was ""giving way to warning signs"" and that US tariffs costs, were starting to feed through to higher prices for American shoppers.
However, in an interview with the BBC, the IMF's chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said the worst consequences of a global trade war had been tempered.
""The effect of the tariff shock is there. It is negative for global outlook. It is weighing down on investment and consumption decisions, there is trade policy uncertainty… but it's not as bad as expected because the shock itself has been scaled down and there are these offsets,"" he said.
The IMF cited Brexit as an example of how uncertainty around major changes in trading arrangements can, after a delay, lead to steady falls in investment and he said the Bank of England should be ""very cautious"" about cutting interest rates as expectations around future inflation remained high.
The IMF's forecast noted that Canada's economy, hit hard by the trade-war with the US will be pushed into third place in the growth league table this year. However, Canada is expected to retake second place next year when its economy is forecast to grow at a rate of 1.5%.
Germany, France and Italy are all forecast to grow far more slowly at rates of between 0.2 and 0.9% in 2025 and 2026.
The IMF also pointed to ""excessively optimistic"" expectations around AI, which could trigger a market correction.
In its separate Global Financial Stability Report the IMF concluded that markets appeared ""complacent"".
Mr Gourinchas said the IMF was not asserting that there would be an imminent bursting of a bubble, but that this was ""one of the risks"" it was looking at.
The concentration of the overvaluation of tech stocks on a small number of companies was now ""substantially higher"" than at the dotcom bubble in 2000, the IMF said.
However, Mr Gourinchas said the ""AI investment boom"" was also helping sustain US economic growth.

Amazon’s Prime Big Deals Days has come and gone. This was the online retail giant’s two-day sales event where you’re able to save big on TVs, tablets, coffee makers, and pretty much anything else. The next massive, site-wide sale won’t be here until Black Friday, but that doesn’t mean you can’t find a good deal. You just have to look hard enough. This Marshall Bluetooth speaker came down in price at the beginning of the month by a whopping $85 and has remained there through the Prime sale. That 47% discount brought the price down from $180 to just $95.
Marshall has been an industry leader in sound engineering for more than 60 years. The company first put its name on the map when it introduced the world to the JTM45 guitar amplifier. That amp produced a much heavier reverberated sound than all other speakers on the market, which helped defined the sound of rock n’ roll. Music was changed forever. Fast forward to today, Marshall still commits itself to crafting great products featuring its signature sound. That’s what you’re getting with this portable Bluetooth speaker.
See at Amazon
First thing you notice about the Marshall Emberton II is its look. This Bluetooth speaker has been models to look like all the iconic Marshall amps of the past, bringing a stylish accent to whatever desk, coffee table, or nightstand you place it on.
The Marshall Emberton II offers a rich stereophonic 360-degree sound that can fill a room and sound great no matter where you are sitting or standing in relation to it. It’s compact in size, but still durable, allowing you to take it with you anywhere without worry.
A portable speaker would be pretty useless without a good battery â so how is the Marshall Emberton II on that front? Well, this speaker will get you over 30 hours of playtime off of a single charge. That over a full day of listening to Ben Platt’s cover ofÂ Diet Pepsi on repeat. If you find you have forgotten to charge.
After pairing your phone in your Bluetooth settings, you can start listening with rich sound immediately. Though, if you download the dedicated app, you can customize your sound to your environment and persona preferences. Mess with the equalizer presets to find what’s perfect whether you’re listening in your living room or outside on the beach.
Right now, you can grab the Marshall Emberton II speaker for $85 off for a limited time.

The sinking demand for electric vehicles (EVs) is starting to take a hit on car manufacturers. In recent years, carmakers have made major investments, betting on electric cars becoming more mainstream, as well as to meet government regulations, but recent shifts in policy and politics have now made those bets costly.
General Motors is the latest company to show how this change is hitting its bottom line. The company said today, in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), that it would take a $1.6 billion hit on its quarterly earnings ending Sept. 30. The charge stems mostly from a drop in the value of its plants and equipment tied to its EV operations along with $400 million in fees and settlements related to canceling supplier contracts associated with EV investments.
âFollowing recent U.S. Government policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives for EV purchases and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, we expect the adoption rate of EVs to slow,â the company said.
U.S. demand for EVs had already started to drop early last year, but itâs now expected to really crater under President Donald Trumpâs policies targeting the market. The biggest blow is the end of the federal $7,500 EV tax credit, which officially expired on Sept. 30. That incentive was scrapped under the administrationâs One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
But the loss of subsidies isnât the industryâs only hurdle. Earlier this year, Trump rolled back federal emissions standards and stripped states of the ability to set their own stricter rules. That move wiped out California and other statesâ requirements that automakers sell more zero-emission vehicles.
The EV industry also faces cultural and consumer challenges. Elon Muskâs growing unpopularity has turned off some buyers, potentially dragging down demand not only for Teslas but for EVs in general.
GM said a âreassessment of our E.V. capacity and manufacturing footprintâ is ongoing and could lead to even more costs in the future.
GM isnât the only company bracing for an EV slowdown. Car companies like Nissan, Honda, and Ford are shifting their strategies, delaying launches and quietly shifting money back into internal combustion vehicles.
Just weeks ago, Ford CEO Jim Farley said at the Ford Pro Accelerate conference in Detroit that EV sales in the U.S. could be slashed in half in the foreseeable future.
âI wouldnât be surprised if EV sales in the US go down to 5%,â Farley told the audience, according to Bloomberg. EVs currently account for nearly 10% of the broader domestic market.
For his part, Farley thinks the industry should move toward âpartial electrificationâ with more hybrid options. In his view, fully electric models make the most sense as commuter vehicles with short drives, accounting for only about 5% to 7% of the market. He said Ford is already looking to retool its battery and EV plants to include hybrid production.

If big automakers want to win on AI, they need to start making more of their own software, Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said.
""I think it's inconceivable that by, call it early 2030s, that a car company can exist at scale and maintain their market share and not have a software defined architecture,"" Scaringe told Stripe cofounder John Collison on Collison's ""Cheeky Pint"" podcast.
Scaringe said that right now, most major automakers rely on ""little islands of software"" for specific functions that aren't always able to communicate with each other. This reality just isn't compatible with an AI world.
""There's so many abstraction layers between the actual code and the manufacturer. I think that must go away for you to be competitive in a world of AI, where you want deep contextual understanding of what's happening across the vehicle and being able to create these highly immersive, highly evolving experiences that get better and better over time,"" he said.
Automakers who don't adapt could soon feel the pinch, Scaringe said.
""If manufacturers don't make that change, they're just going to lose market share,"" he said. ""And the ones that do have that technology are going to gain a lot of market share in the next 10 years.""
It is a bit self-interested to pitch automakers on upping their software game, Scaringe said. Rivian, which has its own tech stack, has an up to $5.8 billion partnership with Volkswagen to work on developing software for both companies. Rivian's leader said that outside similar agreements, traditional automakers might struggle.
""I think every car company is either going to try to develop it themselves, which is hard because they don't typically have those skill sets,"" Scaringe said. ""Try to source it from suppliers. That's very hard because those companies are precisely the ones that don't want to see all their little computers go away. Or, work with us.""
Rivian is already showing a taste of what the future holds, Scaringe said. He pointed to the company's viral Halloween mode, a yearly update where owners can transform their vehicles with lights and sounds. Past editions have included Back to the Future and Knight Rider.
""We're at the tip of the iceberg of being able to do these very immersive, very hard to recreate modes that are just, you can't do with a traditional architecture,"" Scaringe said.

Apple products can come a little pricier then some of its peers. Though, most users find them worth it for their reliability, ease-of-use, or, in some cases, because you bought an iPhone 4s over a decade ago and now have just gotten too used to the Apple ecosystem to migrate out of it. No shame, I’m describing myself too. Apple stuff is simple, it does what we expect them to too, and it integrates easily with all our other Apple crap. That’s why its always nice to see when some of these iPhones, Macs, or AirPods get hit with a big discount.
Right now, Amazon has the Apple AirPods Max over-hear headphones on sale for 22% off. Now, 22% may not sound like a lot at first, but that shakes out to a savings of $119. It brings the price down from $549 to just $430 for a limited time.
See at Amazon
The Apple AirPods Max are a stylish pair of over-the-ear headphones which are capable of high-fidelity audio thanks to the help of the H1 chip alongside Apple’s dynamic driver. These headphones are able to produce sound that can adjust itself in real-time to follow along with you. It does so by tracking your head position so it feels like you are in the pit at your favorite concert venue. And with support for Dolby Atmos, you’ll be hearing rich and detailed audio for certain songs, movies, or shows.
Enjoy pro-level active noise cancelling when using the Apple AirPods Max so you can focus on only the sound you want to hear. Turn off the distracting noises coming from your environment, whether that’s a loud roar of a plane turbine or a chatty office of co-workers.
Battery life is reliable. The Apple AirPods Max will grant you with a solid 20 hours of listening time off of a single charge. That should be enough to get your through your flight or day at the office, no problem.
The limited time discount isn’t available with all color options unfortunately. If you were eyeing either the orange or starlight versions of Apple’s premium line of headphones, you’re in luck. Those are the two seeing the full $119 discount. The other color options are all still on sale, just not for as much. You can pick up the black or blue model of the Apple AirPods Max for $49 off at $500 even or the purple version for $20 off at $529.

8,2025-10-14,"The government shutdown has delayed the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ jobs report, but private data suggests the market remains challenging, though there are a few bright spots for job seekers.
In the latest publicly available BLS jobs report, employers added just 22,000 jobs in August. Most industries were flat or shrank, but health care and social assistance drove much of the gains, adding about 31,000 and 16,000 jobs, respectively. Leisure and hospitality, which includes restaurants and bars, also added 28,000 jobs in August. Still, other sectors' losses offset those gains.
Over the past several months, health care and social assistance have stood out as reliable engines of job growth. In the last three months of BLS data, health care added about 114,000 jobs and social assistance added around 63,000 – together accounting for nearly 3 in 4 added in that same period.
Over the past year of BLS data, these two sectors accounted for a little more than half of all new jobs, with health care adding about 499,000 and social assistance adding around 333,000.
The market may be tough for job seekers outside these industries, but staffing firm experts say there are still opportunities if you know where to look.
Under BLS’ data framework, the health care sector includes ambulatory health care services (such as outpatient care), hospitals, and nursing and residential care facilities. The social assistance sector covers individual and family services, community food and housing, emergency and other relief services, vocational rehabilitation services, and child care services.
In health care, job growth has been relatively steady across subsectors, while individual and family services have seen strong demand within social assistance.
On the clinical side, employers are looking to fill roles for registered nurses, radiologic technicians, physical therapists, nursing assistants, phlebotomists, and home health aids, according to Raj Namboothiry, senior vice president of Manpower North America, a staffing firm. 
There is also demand for non-clinical roles. Jessica Johnson, vice president of the administrative and customer support practice at Robert Half, pointed to rising demand for workers in credentialing, insurance verification, office administration and management, patient registration, member services, and enrollment or financial coordination. 
Johnson added, “No matter what role it is, it’s hard to find skilled talent today,” prompting some employers in these fields to offer incentives to recruit and retain staff, despite signs of cooling in the broader labor market.  
Health care and social assistance sectors are benefiting from pandemic recovery, an aging population, and a growing shift toward home care and telehealth, experts say.
“Health care is turning more into an ecosystem, as opposed to just one single service at a time. It’s like a river branching out into all of these different streams,” Johnson said. “You typically think of traditional medicine, right? But there’s also mental health, home care, telehealth, wellness – the definition just kind of keeps on expanding.” 
Because of that, the health care workforce behind those services needs to expand, Johnson added. 
The sector is also embracing artificial intelligence and other technological advances, creating new opportunities across the field, said Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at Pacific Research Institute.
Winegarden pointed out that health care demand is not tied to the broader business cycle.
“If I get sick, I’m going to be sick, and need health care services,” he said.
President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown may also play a role in increased demand for health care workers. Although immigrants comprise 17% of the total U.S. labor force, they make up 31% of home care workers and 21% of the residential care aid and nursing assistant workforce, according to a 2024 report from Leading Age, an organization representing nonprofit aging services providers. 
While the social assistance sector includes a range of services, social workers make up a significant portion of its workforce. The BLS Occupational Outlook Handbook projects a 6% increase in demand for them from 2024 to 2034, faster than the average for all occupations. This growth may be driven by factors including the aging baby boomer population, as well as increased demand for mental illness and substance abuse treatment, the handbook said.
It's not all doom and gloom in the job market. ManpowerGroup’s Employment Outlook Survey published in September found 38% of employers plan to recruit during the final quarter of the year.
Job seekers hoping to land a stable position may want to look at the health care sector, which has remained relatively recession-proof for people with “the right mindset” and aptitude, Namboothiry said.
Johnson said while there will probably always be demand for workers with specialized skills in critical roles in most fields, health care is a sector where opportunities are not only for frontline workers.
“You might take a look at nonprofit health care organizations that support the hospitals. You might look at digital and health care technology. Maybe an app that focuses on health and wellness,” she said. “If you’re interested in health care, there are a lot of options.”

    Global smartphone shipments saw a notable increase in the third quarter of 2025. Plus, preorders for Apple's new iPhone 17 beat out the iPhone 16.
  
The iPhone 17 Pro Max in its signature orange color.
Despite tariffs and market uncertainty, global smartphone shipments increased 2.6% in the third quarter of 2025, compared to the same time last year, according to the International Data Corporation. Additionally, preorders for the iPhone 17, which launched last month, outpaced last year's iPhone 16.
These increased sales include premium phones like the latest iPhones and Samsung foldables, suggesting yet again that pricier phones still sell in periods of economic strain. It's a remarkable achievement, says IDC senior research director Nabila Popal, citing shrewd financing options as the reason people keep buying these high-end phones, which cost anywhere from $800 to nearly $2,000.
""[Phone makers] have mastered the art of innovation not only in hardware and software to entice upgrades but also in removing purchase friction. They have flawlessly combined cutting-edge devices with innovative financing models and aggressive trade-in programs that make the upgrading decision a 'no-brainer' for consumers,"" Popal said in an IDC press release.
Apple sold 58.6 million iPhones this quarter, an increase of 2.9% over the same period in 2024, with more preorders for the iPhone 17 series than its predecessor. But Samsung wasn't far behind, with its Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7 selling better than all of the company's prior foldables. The company still reigns atop the phone market with 61.4 million phones sold, representing 19% of the market in the third quarter of this year -- an increase of 6.3% from the same period last year. Meanwhile, Apple lands slightly behind Samsung with 18.2% market share this quarter. 
The other phone makers trailing Apple and Samsung are, in order: Xiaomi, with 13.5% of the market; Transsion, with 9%; and Vivo with 8.9%. The remaining companies in the phones industry, from Chinese stalwarts like Oppo and Honor to Motorola and Google, make up the remaining 31.4% of the market for the quarter. All told, 322.7 million phones were sold, up from 314.6 million in the third quarter of 2024, according to IDC.
IDC's findings for the third quarter continue the small but steady growth of phone sales over the year, including a modest 1% increase in the preceding three months -- which includes the April deadline when President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs. In the second quarter, IDC cited midrange devices like Samsung's Galaxy A36 and other phones that started incorporating AI. But even persistent tariffs haven't slowed down people's appetites for pricier phones in the third quarter."

When I started working full-time at 18, I got a great benefits package, including the option to invest in a simple IRA. In addition to the 3 percent employer match, I’ve been making additional contributions, trying to increase my percentage a bit whenever possible, currently at 21 percent.
The advice I’d always been given is that novice investors should never try to play the market, no attempts to buy low/sell high or pick additional stocks, and that seemed very sound, as I have no experience in the field, so I just kept my hands off and assumed that the fund manager was doing whatever needed to be done.
Fast forward 20 years. Late this past February, I needed to visit a branch of the bank that holds the IRA on another matter. The manager I spoke with there accessed my account, did a double-take, and said something that made my blood run cold.
Bank Manager: “What’s all this money doing sitting as cash?”
Me: “It’s doing what???”
Yep. Apparently my strategy was too hands-off, there was no automatic investment into safe index funds as I assumed was happening, you have to actively put IRA money somewhere. So there’s two decades of potential compound interest down the drain.
My instinct was to correct that immediately, but on the advice of a friend, because of the political turmoil, I figured it couldn’t make much difference to wait another couple months. I should have acted then, because the market’s only trended up, although…who knows for how much longer, because of course there’s still political turmoil.
I’ve now got $130,000 I need to do something with— just planning to go with my bank’s S&P index—but since I’m investing that big a chunk all at once as opposed to just a monthly contribution, buying when the market is strong seems like a bad idea. But at what point is that disadvantage outweighed by just starting to earn interest sooner? I don’t want to make another mistake.
—IRA Indecision
Dear IRA Indecision,
I understand why you’re terrified. You just discovered you lost 20 years of compound growth, and now you’re paralyzed by the fear of making another devastating mistake. The thought of investing $130,000 all at once, when the market “feels high,” makes it seem like you’re just going to lose it all in a crash. That fear is understandable—but it’s also leading you astray.Here’s what you need to hear: The biggest mistake is waiting for the perfect moment to invest.
You’re trying to time the market, which is exactly what you were warned against as a novice investor. You already tried this strategy in February—you waited because of “political turmoil”—and the market went up. You lost money by sitting on the sidelines. There will always be reasons to wait: political uncertainty, inflation fears, international conflict, election years, blue moons, or even a bad Tarot card pull.
What you have to remember is that the stock market is a long-term investment. You invest because you believe that the economy will be bigger and better in the future than it is today. There’s never been a losing 20-year period. Stocks go up and down every day, which is why investing in index funds (a diversified basket of stocks that is designed to move with the market) is so popular.
Yes, the market has been exceptionally strong over the past few years. But, that doesn’t mean it will collapse tomorrow. There will be downturns, sure, but no one knows when the downturn will happen, or when the market will recover and go even higher. While dollar-cost averaging works, so does lump sum investing. The point is, every day you wait is a day you’re not earning returns.
I know the fear of buying before a crash is visceral. If you absolutely cannot bring yourself to invest it all at once, split it into four monthly chunks and invest $32,500 each month for four months. But start this month. Don’t wait for some perfect moment that will never come.The real risk isn’t investing when the market is high. The real risk is letting fear keep your money sitting in cash—again—while you wait for certainty that doesn’t exist.
—Ilyce
My mother died when my brother was very young and I filled her shoes since our father was an emotionally distant man. I went into a pretty prestigious line of work and currently make an excellent living, but my brother had a very hard time finding his footing. He bounced from job to job to job, and I was always supportive—until he met his wife.

Earlier this week, Amazon was celebrated Prime Big Deals Days which had extended from October 7 to October 8. It was a great two-day stretch of time to find yourself some excellent savings on just about anything from kitchen appliances to apparel to tech. Had you been hoping to score a new laptop for yourself, but somehow missed the sales event, all is not lost just yet. You can still find some fantastic laptop deals across the website. Like right now, this HP Intel laptop designed for students and businesses dropped its price by a staggering 76%. Amazon has the full price listed at $1,500, so after the discount, it comes down to just $365. That’s a savings of $1,135.
Now before you get too excited, know that this discount â while good â isn’t enormous as it seems. Lots of Amazon sellers tend to jack up the list price of their offerings and then mark the product back down so that it can be labeled with a huge discount. The specs on offer here would really never justify a price of $1,500. The new $365 price tag is a much better reflection of what you’re getting. Still a great value though.
See at Amazon
With this 2025 HP laptop, we’re looking at an Intel N150 four-core, four-thread CPU alongside an integrated graphics card. You’ll have solid performance browsing the web and even doing some light photo or video editing. It’s working with 16GB of RAM and a storage capacity of 128GB.
The screen measures in at 14-inch, keeping it compact and portable to easily fit into any bag on your way to and from class. It displays in slightly above 720p at 1366 by 768 pixels. The HP True Vision 720p web camera and dual-array digital microphone allow you have crystal clear video calls, even in low light conditions.
Included with the laptop is a set of added accessories to get you going. The HP 2025 laptop comes with a wireless mouse and CD/DVD drive which pretty much no laptop comes with on-board any more. You get a 256GB SD card which effectively triples your storage capacity. Then we also have Windows 11 Pro pre-installed as well as a one-year license to Microsoft 365 which will grant your access to Word, PowerPoint, Excel and all the other Microsoft Office apps. Plus that comes with OneDrive so you can save files to the cloud and access them from any device.
For a limited time, you can get the HP laptop with all these additional accessories for just $365.

Searching for the best VPN for iPhone is terrifying. I hopped on the App Store to see my options, and there were dozens of apps I haven't heard of from companies that sound as shady as they do generic. A recent analysis from the Tech Transparency Project also found that several of these free VPNs route internet traffic through Chinese companies.
These free VPNs don't have much of a paper trail detailing their company history, and attract unsuspecting users with success. The top result for “VPN” on the App Store has 1.9 million reviews (of dubious legitimacy), and it’s published by a shell company of a shell company, which was registered by yet another company at the address of a law firm that offers mail drop services. But there are some diamonds in the rough. All the best VPN services have apps for iPhone, but I wanted to dig deeper and find the specific apps that work best on Apple's hardware. There are several good options, but these three VPNs are the ones I’d actually use every day.
Be sure to read our other software guides, like the Best VPNs, Best Password Managers, and Best Website Builders.
How to Install a VPN on iPhone
There’s a section within the settings on iOS that allows you to set up a custom VPN configuration, and when you install a VPN app on iOS, you’ll see a configuration for your VPN provider appear there. Whenever you attempt to connect to a VPN for the first time, a pop-up will appear asking for permission to create a VPN configuration. Tap Allow, and you’re off to the races.
You don’t need to pop into the settings, but if you want to set up a custom configuration, you can find VPN management in the settings app. Open it and follow General > VPN & Device Management. There, you can create a custom VPN configuration. Note that Apple only supports the IKEv2, IPsec, and L2TP protocols. If that’s gibberish to you, these are older, less secure protocols, and you don’t need to pay them much mind.
These custom configurations exist if you want to set up your own VPN. Maybe you’re using a company-issued iPhone and it has a VPN configuration for company resources, or maybe you set up a private VPN using existing cloud infrastructure. For most people, just allowing the VPN app you downloaded to set up a configuration is all you need to do.
Does the iPhone Have a Built-In VPN?
iPhones have a built-in VPN client, but that’s not what most people are talking about with a VPN. The built-in client allows you to set up custom VPN configurations with the IKEv2, IPsec, or L2TP protocols, but Apple doesn’t provide a VPN service. You’ll need a VPN app like NordVPN or ProtonVPN for service.
In short, Apple doesn’t offer a VPN with iPhones. It simply offers a client to configure a custom VPN, which is applicable in some niche cases.
What Does Using a VPN on iPhone Do?
A VPN on iPhone (or elsewhere) protects your internet traffic in a secure tunnel. Before connecting to a website, your internet connection is routed through a VPN server, where it is anonymized and encrypted. In the eyes of the internet, it’s as if all your traffic is coming from that VPN server rather than from the device you’re using.
The main upside to using a VPN on iPhone is privacy. Because you appear anonymous in the eyes of whatever website or service you’re connecting to, it won’t be able to track your activity or log personal information available in a normal connection. There’s some information sent by your browser that a VPN can’t protect, but VPN providers like Windscribe and NordVPN have tools to combat this type of tracking.
In addition to keeping you private, a VPN can get around geo-restrictions. For instance, a streaming service like Netflix might have certain movies available in one country but not another. A VPN can make you appear as if you’re connecting from a different country, unlocking that content. This can also be useful when traveling abroad, be it to connect to streaming platforms or services that might block access from other countries, such as a bank.
Is It Legal to Use a VPN on my iPhone?
VPNs are legal in most countries. There are a few exceptions, notably countries with deep censorship laws and restricted speech, such as Russia and North Korea. Short of those exceptions, VPNs are widely legal to use, regardless of the particular service you’re using.
However, doing illegal things while connected to a VPN is still illegal. A VPN might help you stay private online, but there aren’t exceptions to the law just for using a VPN. It’s a bit like wearing a mask. It isn’t illegal to wear a mask and hide your identity in public, but if you do something illegal, that’s still against the law. A VPN is no different.
NordVPN
NordVPN (2 Year)
NordVPN (Yearly)
NordVPN isn’t just the best VPN for iPhone, it’s a complete security suite for your device. Its Complete plan comes with malware and tracker protection in your browser, a full subscription to NordPass (one of the best password managers), and even 1 TB of secure cloud storage. It also includes scam call protection, which, unfortunately, isn’t available on iOS yet—but as someone who uses it daily to block calls on Android, it’s one of my most anticipated feature additions.
The security suite is excellent, but the VPN at the heart of the service holds up. Across the US, Nord maintained an average drop in speed of 15.32 percent, which is basically in lockstep with the fastest service I tested, Proton. Nord also has a massive network of servers. It’s not the largest, but it’s the spread that counts. Virtual locations are available in restrictive environments like Somalia and Rwanda, and in major media hubs like the US, you’ll find locations in just about every major city.
Nord probably has the best app out of all the iPhone VPNs I tested, too. Most apps from reputable brands are easy to use with one-tap connections, and Nord isn’t different. However, it balances that convenience with a lot of power. You can quickly see specialty servers like P2P locations from the home screen, you can tap a country to connect to the fastest server, or choose a specific location, and you can temporarily pause your connection; useful if you run up against an automated VPN block.
You can also set up multiple emails for dark web monitoring from the app, as well as access Nord’s other services like NordPass and Saily eSIM. Nord’s iPhone app feels basic, but once you start poking around, you’ll quickly find it has just about everything you need.
Proton
Proton VPN (2 Year)
Proton VPN (Yearly)
ProtonVPN is at the top of the list in our Best VPNs guide, but it takes an ever-so-slight backseat to Nord when it comes to iPhone. That mainly comes down to the app. It’s easy to use and comes with some unique features like the ability to make profiles for server selection based on different criteria, but I don’t find it quite as intuitive as Nord’s app.
Regardless, Proton topped the list in speeds when I was testing on iPhone, dropping just 15.23 percent on average across the US (the margins were tight on this one!). Proton offers a free plan with a limited server selection, but you can expect much slower speeds on those servers. Here, I’m recommending ProtonVPN’s Plus plan, not only because it unlocks all the servers and offers faster speeds, but also because it’s pocket change compared to most VPNs.
It’s just $80 for a full year, and even less when you first sign up (Proton offers monthly, annual, and biennial plans). Unlike an increasing number of VPN services, Proton doesn’t offer multiple plans. Even with VPN Plus, you get 10 simultaneous connections, malware and ad blocking, peer-to-peer servers, and Proton’s Secure Core network, which routes your traffic through a small network of servers wholly owned and operated by Proton.
Proton offers much more than a VPN, however, with Proton Unlimited. It includes Proton Pass—also one of our top-rated password managers—encrypted storage, the wildly popular Proton Mail, and even a crypto wallet, if that’s your game. I’m recommending VPN Plus here due to how inexpensive it is, but don’t sleep on Proton Unlimited; it’s actually cheaper than several leading VPN providers and comes with a lot more.

Windscribe (Free)
Windscribe (Pro, Yearly)
Searching for the best free VPN for iPhone is just asking for trouble. Those shady services I mentioned at the top of this article? They’d all like you to believe they’re free VPNs. Nothing is ever truly free, but Windscribe is a remarkably rare exception. It has an excellent free plan, which offers a gentle (and cheap) on-ramp to a paid plan if you want to upgrade.
Unlike Proton, Windscribe restricts data rather than speeds. You have access to servers in 10 countries, but there’s no hit to speed or the number of devices you can connect. You get 2 GB per month to start, 10 GB if you sign up with an email, and an extra 5GB if you post about Windscribe on social media. And, if you want unlimited data, you can build your own plan. Rather than purchasing access to Windscribe’s full network, you can unlock unlimited data for $3 per month, and add locations for an extra $1 per month.
Windscribe is one of only two free VPNs I’m comfortable recommending (the other being Proton), and Windscribe wins out for iPhone. The app is fantastic. Windscribe gives you the traditional one-tap connection on the main screen, but if you dig into the settings, you’ll find a ton of options, from DNS settings to custom VPN configurations.
My favorite feature, however, is R.O.B.E.R.T. It’s an ad, malware, and tracker blocker not dissimilar from the features available at Nord or Proton, but it has a much wider range of options. You can block things like gambling websites and “news” websites known to publish misinformation. You can set up custom rules, as well, blocking specific trackers, ad servers, or even specific websites. You can only have three custom rules on the free plan, but if you upgrade to Windscribe Pro, that goes up to 1,000 custom rules. If you’re diligent enough, you can basically tailor your browsing to only the things you want with R.O.B.E.R.T.
Surfshark: Surfshark was a strong contender for the main list. Even its Starter plan comes with extra features like a masked email generator. Features like ad and tracker blocking, as well as unlimited simultaneous connections, come standard across plans. However, it was a bit slower than my top picks, dropping around 20 percent of speed on average, compared to around 15 percent for the top options.
Mullvad: Mullvad is a favorite among privacy enthusiasts, and for good reason. It doesn’t fuss with multi-year discounts or referral programs, and you don’t even need to provide an email to sign up for an account. You can even pay the static monthly fee by mailing Mullvad cash. It’s a great service if privacy is your top priority, but it trades speeds and features in the process. VPN services like Nord and Proton have quickly grown into full privacy and security suites, while Mullvad is more focused on making a robust VPN. In the context of an iPhone, the scales tip more toward those security suites, but Mullvad is still a great privacy-focused option to keep in mind.
ExpressVPN: By the numbers, ExpressVPN should be at the top of the list. It has a ton of servers, a featureset that can go toe-to-toe with Nord, and speeds only a touch below Proton. However, ExpressVPN has found itself in a spiral of increasing controversies over the past four years, and the brand has yet to get back on solid footing. After being purchased by Kape Technologies—the company behind the infamous adware company Crossrider—former US intelligence official Daniel Gericke took over at CTO and continued in that role for two years, even after being fined over $300,000 by the US Department of Justice for hacking activities on behalf of a foreign government. Gericke left in 2023, but that same year, ExpressVPN experienced a large swath of layoffs, and Kape, its parent company, was delisted from the London Stock Exchange. The vast majority of shares went to Unikmind Holdings Limited, a company owned by Israeli billionaire Teddy Sagi, who got his start by creating gambling software Playtech. That’s an extremely condensed version of what ExpressVPN has gone through over the past few years. The company hasn’t done anything nefarious, but the revolving door of executive control tied to controversial names doesn’t inspire confidence.
Private Internet Access: Private Internet Access, or PIA, is also owned by Kape Technologies, and it followed a similar playbook as ExpressVPN and CyberGhost, which Kape also owns. After the acquisition and community backlash, there’s been very little transparency about what’s going on in the company. A connection to Kape definitely raises questions, but that doesn’t immediately disqualify a service from being included. Unfortunately for PIA, it had much slower speeds than any of the other VPN services I tested, so regardless of ownership, it isn’t a top pick for iPhone VPNs.
You might be surprised how similar the three VPNs I chose are when you break down their features, but that’s not an accident. Given how restrictive I was with who made the final cut, there’s a pretty high bar for inclusion. Although there are some minor differences, I designed this list in a way that you can choose one of my picks without reading a single word and still come out the other side with an excellent VPN for iPhone.
To earn the best iPhone VPN title, a service needs to satisfy three criteria. It needs to be secure, fast, and easy to use. That may seem straightforward enough, but there’s a little more that goes into it. For ease of use, I only looked at VPNs that offer a one-tap connection. If you need to configure anything, that’s a disqualification. That still encompasses a lot of the most popular VPNs on iPhone, so I narrowed the field further by focusing on apps that balance usability with power. You should have all the relevant features in the iOS app that are available in the desktop app, and organized in a way that they don’t disrupt that one-tap experience.
Speed testing is where I focused a lot of my testing time. Speed testing is highly variable, and trying to come out with one singular number to encompass the speed of thousands of servers is a fool’s errand. The numbers I gathered for this guide are the result of 20 tests I ran for each VPN, then averaged.
I tested five locations for each VPN, measuring my unprotected speed immediately before testing and running three passes before averaging. Each location was tested at a different time of day, and I removed any outliers before averaging. For this guide, that meant if there was greater than a 10 percent deviation between two of the three passes. After averaging the speed drop for each location, I gathered all of those numbers together and averaged them for a final speed drop.
Finally, security. The traditional wisdom with a VPN is that you, at some point, have to put some faith in the company that its privacy policy is accurate and it isn’t lying about its logging practices. That didn’t do it for me. Again, I set a high bar for inclusion.
Every VPN I’ve included here has not only been independently audited, but also been forced to uphold its no-logs policy in legal proceedings. You indeed need to put some trust that the VPN provider you’re using is telling the truth, but the options I included all have rock-solid track records when it comes to transparency.

If you see something you like, donât wait too long to grab it, since these offers and stocks tend to go fast.

The standout deals come from the Hisense U65QF and U75QG series. The U65QF lineup gets you brilliant visuals paired with a decent refresh rate and Fire TV support at an approachable price. Itâs available in sizes ranging from 55 inches (ideal for smaller spaces) to a massive 100-inch model. HDR performance is impressive, and gamers will appreciate the AMD FreeSync Premium Pro support that actively reduces screen tearing for a more immersive experience. The 55-inch option is now going for $450 after a $350 discount, while the 100-inch beast can be yours for $1,900, after a massive $1,600 drop.
For a more premium viewing experience, consider screens from the U75QG series. These offer superior peak brightness, advanced local dimming, better overall contrast for lifelike visuals, and Google TV support. Basically, a cinema-level experience at your home, right from your couch. It comes in sizes from 55 inches to an ultra-immersive 116-inch model. Prices start from $568, and go all the way up to $15,000 for the 116-inch model, which is now $10,000 less than its retail price. Looking for a nice mid-range option? The 75-inch screen is also $900 off, sitting at $1,100.
Thereâs a huge variety of screen sizes, so whether youâre after a 55-inch screen for your bedroom or want that full cinema experience in your living room with a 100 or 116-inch screen, itâs all possible. We just don’t know how long the deals or the stock will be around for, so we recommend getting your orders sooner rather than later to avoid any unpleasant surprises. We also don’t expect to see drops this big even on Black Friday from the brand.

The recent collapse of subprime auto-lenders Tricolor Holdings and debt-heavy auto-parts company First Brands has raised questions about the health of the credit market. JPMorgan's CEO Jamie Dimon voiced caution over the high-profile crack-ups, saying his ""antenna"" is up.
""When you see one cockroach, there's probably more,"" Dimon said on the bank's third-quarter earnings call with analysts.
JPMorgan had no exposure to First Brands, but it's taking a $170 million hit from the Tricolor bankruptcy. After many years of a ""benign credit environment,"" Dimon said that ""hopefully"" the credit cycle will unwind in a ""fairly normal"" way.
""I do remind people we've had a bull market for a long time,"" Dimon said. ""Asset prices are high, a lot of credit stuff that you would see out there, you will only see in a downturn.""
Dimon said the bank will ""scour all processes, all procedures, all underwriting,"" in the wake of Tricolor's collapse.
Analysts on the call asked for guidance on how investors should think about risks to the greater economy and credit markets posed by non-bank lending.
CFO Jeremy Barnum said that non-bank lending is ""a very, very broad space,"" and that lending to subprime auto-lenders is a different beast from ""lending to like trillion dollar asset managers on a secured basis.""
There have been two constants during the boom in private credit and non-bank lending over the last few years: non-bank entities are lending more than ever, and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon criticizing non-bank lending.
In May of last year, Dimon said there could be ""hell to pay"" if private credit markets wobble, even though the bank set aside $50 billion of its own balance sheet to make direct loans earlier this year.
While Dimon said that he finds his bank's underwriting standards to be higher than his competitors, his bank can ""make mistakes too,"" he said. But there may be another culprit.
""There clearly was, in my opinion, fraud involved in a bunch of these things,"" Dimon said. The bankruptcy trustee's lawyer in the Tricolor bankruptcy previously said that the firm's business ""appears to be a pervasive fraud of rather extraordinary proportion.""
Barnum and Dimon were not ringing the alarm bell about the entire non-bank lending sector, and it's important to note that increased non-bank lending does, potentially, take some business away from the traditional syndicated lending of banks like JPMorgan.
BlackRock CFO Martin Small said on his firm's earnings call on Tuesday that its private lending business, buoyed by the acquisition earlier this year of private credit giant HPS Investment Partners, is seeing ""generally strong credit quality"" from borrowers.
""They're not seeing widespread credit stress,"" he said.
Even private-credit skeptic Dimon agreed that not all private loans are equal.
""I suspect, when there's a downturn, you will see higher than normal type of credit losses in certain categories,"" Dimon said.

Elliott Hill is one year into his marathon effort to get Nike back on track.
Hill rejoined Nike as CEO on October 14, 2024, after a decadeslong career at the sportswear giant. The former president of consumer and marketplace, who retired from Nike in 2020, returned to lead the company through declining sales, slowing growth, and heightened competition from smaller brands.
Nike shares jumped about 8% on the day Hill's appointment was announced in September.
Hill seemed to start his term with a sprint. He called out the company's missteps and unveiled his strategy to change things.
In March, Nike began its turnaround plan, which Hill calls its ""win now"" strategy. The effort has reoriented the company around sports from running to basketball, rather than gender or age.
Several analysts, including two who spoke to Business Insider, say it's still early, but Hill's plan shows signs of restoring Nike's edge in running and retail. Some gave the brand's comeback a B because it's taking longer than they expected.
A Nike spokesperson told Business Insider that Hill's first year as CEO has been ""defined by focus and renewal.""
""He's reshaped how we operate, restructured the company around the new 'Sport Offense,' rebuilt trust with key retail partners, and he's reenergized the employee community around sport, athletes, and our purpose,"" the spokesperson said. ""In sum, he's brought Nike back to what matters most: serving athletes and advancing the future of sport.""
Here's how Hill's efforts have stacked up in his first year.
During the quarter before Hill started, Nike's revenue fell 10% year over year to $11.6 billion, following flat growth in the 2024 fiscal year.
Hill quickly outlined areas where Nike needed to do better.
Nike had spent years trying to get customers to buy directly from its website and stores, which Hill said stunted its reach through wholesale channels. He planned to rebuild those relationships.
In recent years, Hill said Nike had become too reliant on retro styles like Nike Dunks and Air Force Ones. It lost market share in its core running business to smaller brands, like Hoka and On Running, Morningstar analyst David Swartz told Business Insider. Hill wanted to bring back Nike's focus on sports, including running.
He also criticized Nike's promotions, scaling back discounts through its direct channels and aiming for a more premium experience.
Despite Hill's vision, he hasn't resurrected Nike's stock price.
After the initial bump, the stock has struggled. It's down about 19% from last year, compared with the S&P 500's 13% rise over the same timeframe. The stock is also underperforming some of its peers, including Adidas, which is down about 15% year over year.
The market reaction suggests Wall Street isn't seeing change fast enough. Sales were down 9% at $46.3 billion for the fiscal year 2025.
""The shares lack a catalyst to materially propel them higher until there is greater visibility on brand recovery and an operating margin inflection,"" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a September 30 note.
However, there are signs the company is moving in the right direction.
Nike's ""win now"" strategy focuses on five key action areas: culture, product, marketing, marketplace, and its in-person presence.
The to-do list included improving its relationships with wholesale partners and promoting brand distinction through storytelling. Analysts told Business Insider they've been encouraged by those efforts in particular, which could help Nike climb back to the top of cultural relevancy.
Hill's strategy also includes doubling down on sports, including running, basketball, football, training, and sportswear — to ""put the athlete at the center of everything that we do,"" Hill said in a March earnings call.
He said the company ""realigned"" roughly 8,000 employees around its core sports categories. He's also reset his senior leadership team around Nike's three brands: Nike, Jordan, and Converse.
Nike said its efforts to get back to its running roots are paying off. Hill said the running category is a prime example of what he wants the rest of Nike to look like. Nike's running business grew 20% last quarter.
""Our running team moved fastest into our new formation, and was the first to get sharper on the insights of their athletes,"" Hill said on the most recent earnings call.
With a strategy that revolves around sports, the women's game has become a focal point at Hill's Nike.
In February, it released its first Super Bowl commercial in nearly 30 years, with a cast of star female athletes.
Nike has also expanded its relationship with the WNBA, as part of a 12-year merchandising deal with the league, the NBA, and the NBA G League. The company also released a collaboration with basketball star A'ja Wilson, which sold out online in under five minutes in May. And it signed a deal with Caitlin Clark, whose signature shoe is set to launch in 2026.
One of Nike's bigger bets on women is the NikeSkims brand of performance wear, which was released in September. However, it faces stiff competition.
""NikeSkims has promise, but I don't think it will challenge Lululemon in the short run,"" Swartz at Morningstar said.
Before Hill joined, Nike's relationship with wholesalers, like Foot Locker and Dick's Sporting Goods, had become strained after the company made efforts to bolster its direct-to-consumer channels.
""Nike cut off a bunch of retailers to try to drive traffic to its own apps and stores, but it discovered that it lost customers that it could not get back,"" Swartz said to Business Insider.
Today, things are looking up for Nike's wholesale partnerships. Its wholesale revenues were $6.8 billion in its first quarter of fiscal year 2026, up 7% from the year prior.
""Elliott is also striking wholesale deals left, right, and center to make Nike as accessible as possible,"" EMARKETER analyst Rachel Wolff said.
Nike is back on Amazon, for example, and struck partnerships with smaller retailers like Urban Outfitters and Aritzia.
Nike's direct-to-consumer channels remain a key pressure point. Digital revenues fell 12% year-over-year last quarter, after a 26% drop in the 2025 fiscal year. Direct revenue fell 14% to $4.4 billion last fiscal year.
Part of the decline stems from Hill's directive to pull back on promotions on the direct-to-consumer side of the business. Hill said in March that there were zero promotional days on Nike Digital in January and February for the North America region, compared to over 30 for the same period in 2024.
""We are working to find the right assortment and marketing mix to consistently bring consumers back to our digital ecosystem,"" Hill said in a September earnings call.
Traffic to Nike's stores is also down. As of June, Placer.ai reported that visits to Nike stores had been trending negative for eight months straight.
Nike is trying to revamp the store experience. At an experimental location in New York, for example, Hill said the layout has been overhauled around sports, with areas like a running zone.
""From a physical perspective, we're feeling really good about the direction that we're headed,"" Hill told CNBC in early October.
In Wolff's book, Hill gets a ""B."" The EMARKETER analyst said Hill's revitalization of Nike is going well, but there are ""question marks"" around its road to recovery. Chief among them are the impact of tariffs on Nike's business and the potential for price hikes to backfire.
Nike said it's working this year to mitigate $1.5 billion in expected tariff costs, which led the company to raise prices.
Swartz gave Hill an ""incomplete"" grade.
""I wouldn't give him an 'A' because the turnaround is taking longer than expected,"" he told Business Insider. ""Nonetheless, I think the company is on the road to recovery.""
Nike reported first-quarter revenue of $11.7 billion, up 1% year over year and driven by success in North America, wholesale, and its running category.
In the long term, analysts seem optimistic about Nike's comeback bid. Although it's still early, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote that they expect it to ""drive stronger results in product creation, brand marketing, and marketplace offense.""
The Goldman Sachs analysts outlined three key challenges ahead: the competitive sportswear market, Nike's declining sales in China, and its struggling DTC business.
Still, Hill reminded investors during a September earnings call that it's a marathon, not a sprint.
""We're in the early stages, and our comeback will take time, and our progress won't be linear,"" Hill said.

18,2025-10-14,"Promotion: a panel of experts discussed the qualities of enduring design at a talk hosted by US brand Design Within Reach and Dezeen at Chicago Fulton Market. 
Hosted by Dezeen contributing editor Dan Howarth, the talk titled What makes modern timeless? brought together British industrial designer Matthew Hilton, Design Within Reach (DWR) brand creative director Omar Nobil and Mobile Makers founder Maya Bird-Murphy to discuss the values of long-lasting design.
The talk coincided with an exhibition showcasing DWR's designs with Case Furniture from the past 20 years, including the Matthew Hilton-designed Kelston Sofa, in addition to the designer's newly launched Danbury Dining Table and Galera Bed.
""This exhibition is very much about enduring design, and we're conscious of not saying timeless,"" said Nobil. ""It's okay for things to exist within a period of time. I love that you can see a Pierre Paulin product and have a sense of when it was designed – it's still relevant today, because it still has a use and a function.""
""The goal is enduring, not timeless,"" he added.
Long-term collaborator of DWR, Hilton agreed that the best designs are rooted in their time.
""The classics of design are not timeless,"" he said. ""It's just that we still love them. They're of their time completely and of a person – they are filled with a personal view of whatever was happening in the world. I don't see how timeless can exist.""
Howarth kicked off the discussion by asking each of the panellists to select a lasting piece of design from the 20th century.
Hilton selected a coffee pot for Alessi designed by Richard Sapper, while Nobil picked Levi's 501 jeans and Bird-Murphy selected Frank Lloyd Wright's home and studio.
With each panellist selecting a modern piece of design, the conversation moved to the definition of modern design and how that is evolving.
""Defining what modern means for our brand has been a big part of the early, torturous part of my journey with taking this role on,"" said Nobil. ""We're on a real shift in our trajectory as a brand, working with people like Matthew, working with a whole host of really interesting, independent design studios.""
""Globally defining modern with a lowercase m has been a really big part of how we've defined the DWR studio,"" he continued.
Nobil explained that at DWR, they are trying to build on the ethos of the mid-century modern designers who are a key part of the brand's history.
""For us, modern has to really be a mindset,"" he said. ""It's not an aesthetic. What we've taken from those mid-century modern designers that are really central to our story as a brand is the spirit of modernity, and that mindset of really confronting the challenges of our time and meeting them with a sense of optimism.""
Building on this, Bird-Murphy explained that she believes the key to lasting design is relevance.
""I think that optimism is really important, but I think it's also about relevancy,"" said Bird-Murphy. ""And to me, if you're talking about an object that you've had for many, many years, that object is still relevant to you.""
""I think that if design is relevant, then it's working for the people of that time, and it might even be flexible to evolve over time,"" she continued.
Bird-Murphy explained that aesthetics are important, but are often not the most essential part of design.
""We shouldn't make for the sake of making,"" she said. ""Beauty is incredibly important, and for folks in communities, especially like in Chicago on the south and west sides, having beautiful furniture and spaces is incredibly important.""
""But I think there are some ground-level issues first that need to be addressed, and then hopefully, we all can be sitting in rooms like this and having that equal access to just gorgeous pieces.""
Nobil agreed that creating products that solve problems is the key to longevity, rather than chasing trends.
""We start with a problem to solve, a human need to address, as opposed to designing into a product category – like looking at your assortment and what are we missing?"" he said. ""Designing into a trend, that's really where the danger lies.""
The talk wrapped up with the panellists picking an item from the past 25 years that they believe will demonstrate lasting design.
""There's something that's changed my life enormously, which is – and I'm sorry it's a bit of a cliche, but it's not the phone, but the iPad,"" said Hilton.
""It's just completely crazy – it allows me to work absolutely anywhere, and that, for me, has changed my life really quite significantly. I don't care what it looks like, I care how it works.""
Nobil agreed that it was ""super hard to predict"", but also chose an Apple product.
""I mean, I hate to give Apple so much credit, and this is not sponsored by Apple, but the iPod, to me, was a small window of a golden age of walking around with music,"" he added. ""I'm sad that the circular dial went, as I think it is just an incredible piece of design.""
Bird-Murphy concluded by highlighting not an individual product, but a mindset.
""There's a huge shift happening in the design industry right now, and I think that all of us are going to feel it, whether it's climate change, AI or whatever,"" she said. ""I hope that we as designers really understand our power.""

CrowdStrike stock (NASDAQ: CRWD) has climbed 12% over the past month, fueled by optimism following its mid-September investor day. At that event, the company issued long-term guidance that exceeded analyst expectations, projecting net new Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) growth of at least 20% in fiscal year 2027 and setting a target of $10 billion in ARR by FY2031. 
Given this strong guidance and the company’s robust operating performance and financial condition, we believe there isn’t much to worry about regarding CRWD stock. The primary concern, however, is its very high valuation, which makes the stock seem relatively expensive following the recent run-up. Here is our multi-factor evaluation to determine if it’s still a buy.
That is one perspective on stocks. Trefis High Quality Portfolio assesses much more and is structured to minimize stock-specific risk while providing upside exposure. Separately, see – What's Happening With RGTI Stock?
Let’s delve into details of each of the evaluated factors, but prior to that, for quick background: With $127 Bil in market cap, CrowdStrike offers cloud-delivered security for endpoints, cloud workloads, identity, and data through its subscription-based Falcon platform and cloud modules via direct sales and channel partners.
This table illustrates how CRWD is valued compared to the broader market. For further details see: CRWD Valuation Ratios

This table highlights how CRWD's profitability compares to the broader market. For more details see: CRWD Operating Income Comparison
CRWD experienced an effect slightly better than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. We determine this based on both (a) how considerably the stock declined and, (b) how swiftly it recovered.
2022 Inflation Shock
2020 COVID-19 Pandemic
However, the risk isn't confined to major market crashes. Stocks can decline even when markets are performing well – consider events like earnings reports, business updates, or changes in outlook. Read CRWD Dip Buyer Analyses to understand how the stock has bounced back from sharp declines previously.
The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a selection of 30 stocks, has a history of significantly outperforming its benchmark, which encompasses all three – S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; making for a less volatile experience, as evidenced by HQ Portfolio performance metrics."
21,2025-10-14,"The popularity of the iPhone 17 lineup saw Apple almost match Samsung’s market share for the third quarter of the year, according to new IDC data.
The firm describes it as “a remarkable achievement,” attributing the ability to sell even more premium phones in a challenging economy to a combination of three factors …
CNET reports IDC estimating Apple’s market share in Q3 as 18.2%, almost matching that of Samsung’s 19%.
Preorders for the iPhone 17, which launched last month, outpaced last year’s iPhone 16 […] Apple sold 58.6 million iPhones this quarter, an increase of 2.9% over the same period in 2024 […] Samsung still reigns atop the phone market with 61.4 million phones sold, representing 19% of the market in the third quarter of this year — an increase of 6.3% from the same period last year. Meanwhile, Apple lands slightly behind Samsung with 18.2% market share this quarter.
IDC says that continuing innovation in both hardware and software are part of the reason for the continued sales success of both premium iPhones and folding phones, but finance schemes like the iPhone Upgrade Program and trade-in deals also play an important role.
It’s a remarkable achievement, says IDC senior research director Nabila Popal, citing shrewd financing options as the reason people keep buying these high-end phones, which cost anywhere from $800 to nearly $2,000.
“[Phone makers] have mastered the art of innovation not only in hardware and software to entice upgrades but also in removing purchase friction. They have flawlessly combined cutting-edge devices with innovative financing models and aggressive trade-in programs that make the upgrading decision a ‘no-brainer’ for consumers,” Popal said
The company says that so far the impact of tariffs doesn’t seem to be biting too hard, though we of course don’t know how strong demand would have been without them.

Oklo Inc. (NYSE: OKLO), the advanced nuclear technology firm developing small modular reactors (SMRs), has emerged as one of the most remarkable stock market narratives of 2025. Shares are currently trading at approximately $168, having increased more than seven times year-to-date, as investors speculate on nuclear's capability to power AI data centers, industrial sites, and the overall transition to clean energy.
However, following such an incredible surge, the pivotal question has evolved: is Oklo valued for perfection — or for potential disappointment? Additionally, see: Oklo Stock To Increase 50% More?
For those looking for an upside with reduced volatility compared to holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has significantly outperformed its benchmark, which includes a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes, achieving returns that have exceeded 105% since its inception. Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have demonstrated better returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; delivering a smoother ride, as illustrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Furthermore, see Can PayPal Stock Fall To $50?
Oklo continues to be a pre-revenue entity, and while its aspirations are commendable, revenue generation is still quite a few years away. The firm has indicated about 14 GW of customer interest — a pipeline potentially translating to $5 billion or more in yearly revenue by 2028 if projects come to fruition.
Nonetheless, at the current share price of $167, Oklo holds a market capitalization of about $25 billion, despite not having produced or sold a single reactor yet. This valuation is generally associated with established industrial or energy companies that have billions in current revenue, rather than pre-commercial ventures still navigating licensing and prototype phases.
Even if Oklo reaches $5 billion in annual revenue by 2028, the stock is presently trading at nearly five times potential sales for 2028. Should execution falter or timelines extend — which is a plausible scenario in the nuclear industry — a reassessment toward two times sales would suggest a share price closer to $70–75, representing a 50% decline from current prices.
Nuclear energy — particularly SMRs — constitutes one of the most complex and sluggish sectors of energy infrastructure. Each phase, from licensing to construction and operation, demands years and billions of dollars. Even with robust customer interest, Oklo’s capacity to transform those commitments into operational reactors remains unproven.
In contrast to software or solar initiatives that can expand rapidly, SMRs necessitate patience, capital, and impeccable execution — three elements that markets seldom reward simultaneously.
At $167 per share, Oklo’s market capitalization reflects substantial expectations — not only for regulatory success but also for perfect execution and swift commercialization. The firm could ultimately validate these expectations if it achieves multi-gigawatt deployment by 2028, but the journey is protracted and uncertain.
If timeframes extend or investor enthusiasm wanes, a retreat toward the $70–80 range would be entirely plausible — and perhaps even beneficial.
Oklo stands as one of the most audacious bets in clean energy today: high potential, high visibility, and equally high risk. For investors with long-term perspectives and a strong tolerance for volatility, it continues to be a captivating narrative. For others, the existing valuation likely presumes too much, too quickly.
Now, we apply a risk assessment framework while constructing the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four-year timeframe —and has achieved returns surpassing 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded better returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; offering a steadier experience as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics."
23,2025-10-14,"If youâve been scrolling through your social media this spooky season (or strolling around your neighborhood), you mightâve already noticed an increase in vintage Halloween dÃ©cor. After years of hyperrealistic animatronics and inflatable lawn monstersâand, of course, the rise of Home Depotâs Skelly and similar productsâpeople are craving something a little more personal, and a lot more nostalgic.Â 
Vintage dÃ©cor taps into the warmth that modern Halloween often misses. The festivities used to be more about neighborhood celebrations and handmade costumes. Now, the holiday is a billion-dollar business.Â 
Americans spent nearly $12 billion on Halloween last year, according to the National Retail Federation. But they werenât just shelling out on the latest inflatables: a growing chunk of that went toward secondhand and vintage-inspired dÃ©cor.Â 
Add Mental Floss as aÂ preferred news source!
The uptick in vintage Halloween dÃ©cor is partly inspired by a desire for more sustainability (why buy new when the old stuff is better made?) and partly a rebellion against the cookie-cutter aesthetic of big-box holiday aisles.Â 
Plus, vintage and retro decorations often just look coolerâand allow someone to really let their personal tastes shine. Thereâs an authenticity in their imperfections that no mass-produced skeleton can replace.
If youâre hunting for the real deal, skip Amazon and start local. Thrift stores, estate sales, and flea markets are treasure troves for those willing to dig.Â 
If you donât want to go searching in person, you can always check out online stores on Ebay and Etsy. Be especially on the lookout for old Beistle pieces (the company made some of the first mass-produced Halloween decorations in the 1920s).
Facebook Marketplace and your local buy-nothing groups can also yield some solid vintage findsâthereâs bound to be someone near you looking to offload the decades-old dÃ©cor thatâs been sitting in their garage for far too long.
One of the best ways to pull off a vintage Halloween look is to mix eras (you donât have to go 100 percent vintage to create a fun, fesive display):Â 
Most importantly, remember that these vintage finds are less about following a current trend and more about bringing back the joy of Halloweens past and creating a display that truly captures your own unique interests. After all, buying what you loveâand will use year after yearânever goes out of style.

Rocket Lab’s (NASDAQ: RKLB) stock has garnered considerable investor interest in 2025, climbing over 150% year-to-date. Trading at about $65, this extraordinary surge reflects an increasing optimism surrounding the company’s Neutron rocket program and its growing involvement in the commercial space sector. Nevertheless, under this excitement lies a valuation dilemma: the company is trading at a price-to-sales ratio of 66.5x—more than twenty times the S&P 500’s 3.2x multiple. For investors contemplating entry at these levels, the pivotal question is whether this momentum is supported by fundamentals or primarily fueled by speculation regarding future prospects. Based on traditional valuation metrics, this premium seems challenging to rationalize.
We’ll explore the company’s financials in the sections that follow. That said, if you are looking for an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like RKLB, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns greater than 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; they avoided the drastic fluctuations, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

The company’s financial profile exposes stark inconsistencies:
Despite its unprofitability, Rocket Lab possesses a strong balance sheet that allows them to pursue growth investments:
The stock has shown moderate resilience amid market volatility. While it dropped 82.8% during the 2022 inflation crisis (more severe than the S&P 500’s 25.4% decline), it rebounded to pre-crisis levels by November 2024 and has since continued to rise. See more – Buy or Sell RKLB Stock?
Our evaluation focuses on past performance and current fundamentals, which suggest RKLB is overvalued. Nonetheless, we may be mistaken in this evaluation, and investors might be inclined to accept a higher valuation multiple for the stock’s future potential, especially concerning the Neutron rocket program. The Neutron rocket signifies a strategic advancement into the medium-lift launch market, potentially positioning the company to compete more effectively with SpaceX’s Falcon 9. If this program succeeds, it could significantly enlarge Rocket Lab’s addressable market and alter its financial dynamics. The company’s solid balance sheet offers the financial endurance to realize this vision without immediate pressure for profitability.
That being said, investing in a single stock without thorough analysis can be perilous. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has surpassed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to deliver strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks has offered a responsive way to capitalize on favorable market conditions while minimizing losses during downturns, as explained in RV Portfolio performance metrics.
Rocket Lab is deemed expensive when assessed against present operations—a company losing nearly 46 cents for every dollar of revenue while being valued at 66.5x sales. For investors concentrated on traditional value metrics, this introduces considerable downside risk.
Nonetheless, for those who have faith in the company’s technological prowess and the transformative potential of its Neutron program, the existing valuation may signify fair compensation for engaging in the commercial space industry's growth trajectory. Ultimately, the investment decision rests on whether one is acquiring historical performance or prospective opportunities."

Over the past decade, Broadcom stock (NASDAQ: AVGO) has returned an impressive $51 billion to its investors through direct cash in the form of dividends and buybacks. This shareholder-focused strategy has delivered extraordinary results in 2025, with the stock posting a remarkable 50% year-to-date return, dramatically outperforming the broader market and establishing AVGO as one of the year’s most compelling semiconductor investments despite recent volatility. See – What’s Behind The Surge In Broadcom’s Stock? – for more details. 
Broadcom's commitment to consistent income generation continues through its steady quarterly dividend of $0.59 per share, maintaining an annualized dividend of $2.36 that yields approximately 0.68%, with the company successfully sustaining 13 consecutive years of dividend increases since becoming a public company. 
The semiconductor giant's robust capital allocation was significantly amplified in April 2025 when the board authorized a massive $10 billion share repurchase program running through December 31, 2025, reflecting management's confidence in the company's strong cash flow generation and its dominant position in AI infrastructure and mission-critical software. 
Broadcom’s exceptional financial performance has been underpinned by robust revenue growth, with Q3 2025 revenues reaching $16 billion and generating an impressive free cash flow of $7 billion (44% of revenue), while Q4 guidance of $17.4 billion represents a 24% year-over-year increase driven by accelerating demand for AI semiconductors and infrastructure software solutions. 
Let’s examine some statistics and evaluate how this payout capability compares to the market’s leading capital-return powerhouses. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like AVGO, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Separately, see – What's Happening With RGTI Stock?
Interestingly, AVGO stock ranks as the 53rd largest return to shareholders in history.
Why should you care? This is because dividends and share buybacks signify direct and tangible returns of capital to investors. They also indicate management’s confidence in the company’s financial well-being and its capacity to generate sustainable cash flows. Furthermore, there are numerous other stocks with similar characteristics. Below is a list of the top 10 companies ranked by the total capital returned to investors via dividends and stock repurchases.
For the complete ranking, visit Buybacks & Dividends Ranking
What do you observe here? The overall capital returned to investors as a percentage of the current market capitalization seems inversely related to growth potential for reinvestments. Companies such as Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) are expanding at a quicker pace, in a more predictable manner, compared to others, yet they have delivered a significantly lower percentage of their market valuation to stockholders.
That’s the downside to substantial capital returns. While they are appealing, one must reflect on the question: Am I forfeiting growth and robust fundamentals? Keeping that in perspective, let’s analyze some figures for AVGO. (see Buy or Sell Broadcom Stock for further details)
Nonetheless, AVGO isn’t immune to significant declines. It experienced a drop of nearly 48% during the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 35% in the 2021 inflation shock, and around 27% in the 2018 correction. Even with robust fundamentals, it’s apparent that the stock can endure substantial setbacks when the market shifts. Quality companies still suffer when investor sentiment changes dramatically.
However, the risk isn't restricted to considerable market declines. Stocks can decrease even when markets are favorable – consider events such as earnings reports, business updates, and changes in outlook. To understand how the stock has bounced back from sharp downturns in the past, read AVGO Dip Buyer Analyses.
Remember, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics."

Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) stock deserves your consideration. Why? Because you get monopoly-like high margins for a discounted price. Here is some data.
While revenue growth helps, this is not a growth perspective. Pricing power and high margins generate consistent, predictable profits and cash flows, which reduce risk and allow capital to be reinvested. Market tends to reward that.
As a quick background, Intuitive Surgical provides innovative surgical systems that empower physicians to perform complex minimally invasive procedures, improving quality and access to healthcare worldwide.

But do these numbers tell the full story? Read Buy or Sell ISRG Stock to see if Intuitive Surgical still has an edge that holds up under the hood.
Single stock can be risky, but there is a huge value to a broader diversified approach. If you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio (HQ) - HQ has outperformed its benchmark - a combination of S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap index, and achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Risk management is key - consider, what could long-term portfolio performance be if you blended 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto with HQ's performance metrics.
Here is how we make the selection: We consider stocks > $10 Bil in market cap, and then filter out those with high CFO (cash flow from operations) margins or operating margins. We additionally consider only those stocks that have meaningfully declined in valuation over the past 1 year.
Below are statistics for stocks with this selection strategy applied since 12/31/2016.
That said, ISRG isn’t immune to big drops. It plunged over 82% in the Dot-Com Bubble and nearly 76% in the Global Financial Crisis. The Inflation Shock saw a roughly 50% dip, while the Covid pandemic and 2018 correction triggered declines around 40% and 24%, respectively. So even with all its strengths, ISRG can take a serious hit when the market turns south.
But the risk is not limited to major market crashes. Stocks fall even when markets are good - think events like earnings, business updates, outlook changes. Read ISRG Dip Buyer Analyses to see how the stock has recovered from sharp dips in the past.
The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming its benchmark that includes all 3 - the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices.

Joby Aviation stock (NYSE: JOBY) has captivated Wall Street with its vision of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft transforming urban transportation. The stock has experienced a remarkable rise, increasing by over 200% from under $6 a year ago to approximately $17 now. What’s driving the excitement? It’s a blend of future mobility enthusiasm and momentum. Firstly, there’s the overarching narrative of electric vehicles and sustainable transportation that has taken the markets by storm. Secondly, the concept of the “flying taxi” has investors envisioning a sci-fi future coming true. Thirdly, Joby has been making strategic advancements – forming partnerships with major entities like Delta Air Lines and Toyota, reaching certification milestones, and generating news that maintains the excitement.
The firm has positioned itself as a leader in the burgeoning eVTOL market, announcing progress on FAA certification and expanding its manufacturing capabilities. However, here’s the sobering reality – while electric air taxis appear to be the future, that future is still years away from significant commercial operations and generating revenue. Joby continues to be a pre-revenue entity, depleting cash reserves as it strives for certification and commercialization. Naturally, it’s incurring losses – aerospace development is one of the most capital-intensive industries. For context, the company's operating cash flows were -448 million, with an operating loss of $638 million in the previous twelve-month period.
That said, if you are looking for an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like JOBY, you might consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has yielded returns exceeding 105% since its inception. What’s the reason for this? As a collective group, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered better returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; a smoother ride, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
We agree that next-generation mobility stocks are focused on future growth, and the potential market for urban air mobility is vast. See our perspective on – Why Archer Aviation Is Positioned To Become The Uber of Air Travel.
However, have you ever considered the downside risks? Think about it logically. There are numerous risks that could undermine Joby’s stock growth, and when things go awry, such speculative stocks don’t just dip – they plunge. This isn’t merely a theory.
Let’s examine what occurred with JOBY during the inflation shock of 2022 when the Fed raised interest rates aggressively. The stock plummeted a staggering 79.7% from its peak of $15.70 in February 2021 to $3.18 by December 2022, while the S&P 500 fell only 25.4% from peak to trough. Consider that for a moment – JOBY dropped more than three times worse than the overall market. This highlights the distinction between speculative pre-revenue stocks and genuine businesses with real cash flows and profits. Yes, the stock regained its pre-crisis peak by July 2025 and even climbed to $20.39 in August, but that recovery took place during one of the most favorable environments for risk assets. What will occur when the cycle flips again?
So what’s the actual downside risk for JOBY stock from its current price of $16.80?
If history serves as a guide, it’s a possible decrease of approximately 80% or more, bringing the stock back to the $3-4 range.
Are you ready for it?
This isn’t fearmongering about JOBY – it's what transpired in 2022. The stock plummeted 80% from its peak to trough. And the fundamental risk profile hasn’t changed significantly. The company is still pre-revenue, still experiencing cash burn, now facing substantial dilution from the $500 million equity raise, still years away from significant commercialization, and primarily trading based on hope and future potential instead of current business fundamentals.
The next time markets experience a risk-off scenario – be it due to inflation, recession, geopolitical crises, or any other shock – high-flying pre-revenue stocks often lead the decline. An 80% drop from current levels would bring JOBY to around $3.36, uncannily close to where it hit bottom in December 2022.
If this level of risk makes you anxious, you might want to consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. What accounts for this? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks has provided an effective way to capitalize on favorable market conditions while limiting losses when markets decline, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.
The intent of this analysis is to inform investors of the actual downside risk associated with JOBY stock. It may or may not occur. However, the risk is undoubtedly substantial. The firm remains pre-revenue in one of the most capital-intensive and heavily regulated industries in the world. The recent $500 million equity raise – while prolonging the cash runway – significantly dilutes existing shareholders and emphasizes that commercialization and profitability are still aspirations.
Understand that you are not investing in a profitable business; you are betting on eVTOL technology receiving certification, gaining public acceptance, achieving profitable operational scale, and Joby emerging victorious in a market characterized by fierce competition from well-capitalized rivals.
Ultimately, it boils down to whether you can tolerate what the downside volatility might resemble if matters don’t unfold as anticipated with Joby. An 80% drawdown isn’t hypothetical – it has already occurred once. The question isn’t whether JOBY can decline that much again. The inquiry is: when the next market shock hits, are you ready to see your investment possibly drop by 80% or more?"

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Joseph Leemon, a 44-year-old from Rochester Hills, Michigan. His previous employment, offer, application count, and identity have been verified by Business Insider. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
I was laid off from my last job on October 3, 2023. On October 4, I updated my résumé and redownloaded all the job apps.
Since then, I've applied to roughly 2,000 jobs.
I sought outside counsel from recruiters or others in managerial positions. I also tried out three résumé-writing services, spending hundreds of dollars on them with no results. I also used ChatGPT, but I really didn't like what I read from it. My résumé got to the point where it just sort of felt like some random keywords that were hopefully going to be caught by the ATS system.
My last job was as an agent services specialist at a real-estate tech company. I wasn't looking for anything too far out of my previous job scope, but I was looking for something more in the operational space or at the managerial level.
On September 10 of this year, I was finally lucky enough to apply to a support specialist role with an IRA firm that accepted me. My first day is on October 27. While it's not a managerial position, there's a possibility of moving up, and it's the most I've ever made annually.
Here's how I finally got an offer:
For almost my entire search, I had just been applying to remote roles because of my home situation. My wife, who works as a grant writer, has to drive an hour plus to the office three days a week, and my daughter is in pre-school in the mornings on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
Around mid-September, I shifted my thinking and started applying to more hybrid roles amid the big back-to-office push. I applied to about 30 hybrid roles since then. My new job will be in-person two or three days a week, about 20 minutes from where I live.
Until that point, I didn't know if I was even applying to real positions. I was just throwing applications out there. I felt like there was a better chance of hybrid jobs not being fake because they at least wanted to see your face sometimes. So, I think my advice to others would be not to just click and apply. Go to the websites and make sure it's real.
Honestly, I think the reason I got the interview was because I previously worked with the recruiter who contacted me for the current job. She left about a year and a half before I did, but she remembered me.
Everybody talks about networking, but you need to have those existing connections, and I was lucky I had this very slim one to get my foot in the door.
I'm lucky that I didn't burn a lot of bridges in my past jobs, but even reaching out to former colleagues seemed untenable in a way, because the place they'd be working wasn't hiring. So how much help could they give me?
I didn't network a ton throughout the job search, and if I could do my job search again, I would be really intentional about who I was networking with.
I think a lot of it was luck in this case. If the person I used to work with in a very light capacity didn't recognize my name and didn't see that my last job was her last job, who knows how much longer I would have waited?
I was feeling very low in August and the beginning of September, thinking that I might have aged out of the job market, even though I'm going to be just 45 in November. I thought, what's this going to look like for myself and my family?
My wife and I were both lucky that we're good with money and have saved a lot. But we live in an upper-middle-class area in Michigan, and things are expensive, especially with inflation. We were getting real close to selling a car because, while we have savings, the savings were meant for our child, and weren't supposed to be used for decades. We're also trying to adopt a second child, so the situation was really starting to add a lot of stress.
Throughout the two years, my job search ebbed and flowed. I would apply to about 50 jobs a day, but then spend two weeks not applying at all because I was so down about the process. I think it's OK to take time off from the job search to recharge — I did that multiple times, and it really helped.

After nearly three years of sputtering and false starts since the pandemic-era highs, dealmaking is finally looking like it's back in gear on Wall Street.
Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and Citi all reported stronger third-quarter results as CEOs revived mergers and financing plans that had stalled while investors waited for markets to thaw. For the second quarter in a row, signs are mounting that the long-standing dealmaking drought, which has dragged on, affecting bankers' pay and morale, is showing real signs of easing.
Goldman led the rebound with its third-highest quarterly net revenues ever: more than $15 billion, the bank said in its quarterly earnings release.
David Solomon, the firm's CEO, told investors in a shareholder call on Tuesday that mergers were back — driving the firm's advisory revenues 60% higher than the same period one year earlier, to a quarterly total of $1.4 billion. Overall investment banking fees totaled almost $2.7 billion, 42% higher than the third quarter of 2024. Equity underwriting revenues of $465 million were up 21% from the same time last year; debt underwriting was up 30%, to $788 million.
This year, the firm advised on the public offerings of Klarna and Figma, which went public last month. It also advised on the proposed $50 billion Anglo American and Teck Resources merger and Electronic Arts' $55 billion take-private — blockbuster deals announced this quarter, whose fees are not yet included in the bank's results.
""The setup remains constructive,"" he said, praising a ""more supportive regulatory environment"" for spurring renewed activity.
He predicted ""a very constructive M&A environment through the end of the year into 2026."" Denis Coleman, Goldman's chief financial officer, said its dealmaking backlog was the highest it had been in three years across equity, debt, and advisory.
Jeremy Barnum, JPMorgan's finance chief, warned in a separate earnings call that market prospects can change on a dime and Wall Street shouldn't get too comfortable.
""As you well know,"" he said, ""that could change overnight.""
For example, if the government shutdown continues, it could stall capital markets and public issuance activity, potentially hurting ECM bankers who take companies public.
The volume of deals worth $5 billion or more surged 64% from last year: 100 so far in 2025, up from 61 by this point in 2024, LSEG data show. The boost created benefits for rival banks like Citi and JPMorgan.
Goldman and JPMorgan shares slid more than 2% on Tuesday morning alongside a broader market sell-off, while Citigroup rallied roughly 2%.
JPMorgan's investment banking fees rose 16%. Commercial and investment banking net revenues reached nearly $20 billion for the quarter, with CEO Jamie Dimon saying, ""ECM and M&A activity picked up against a supportive backdrop.""
""The quarter showcased the strength of JPMorgan's diversified business model, with all major segments contributing to growth,"" said Kenneth Leon, director of equity research at CFRA Research. ""We think this will lead the momentum for the rest of 2025 and into 2026.""
JPMorgan CFO Barnum told shareholders Tuesday that the rebound in lending is ""mirroring the pickup in deal activity across our investment-banking businesses,"" highlighting how client borrowing and transaction volumes are moving in tandem again. ""We're starting to see more M&A activity,"" he added, citing ""the busiest summer we've had in a long time,"" and a rate environment conducive to dealmaking.
The bank said trading and client activity were contributing to a better dealmaking landscape, and executives cited higher compensation and ""growth in front office employees"" — a reversal from the firm's position earlier this year, when Barnum said leadership had told managers to ""resist hiring"" and try to do more with less.
Citi's investment bank generated more than $1.1 billion in fees, a 17% increase from the previous year.
The investment banking unit has experienced a surge of ambition driven by its new IB chief, Viswas Raghavan, a former JPMorgan dealmaker who joined Citi last year as executive vice chair and head of banking under CEO Jane Fraser. Corporate lending revenue was up nearly 40% as clients tapped its balance sheet again.

We all know ChatGPT. What about SextGPT?
On Tuesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote on X that the company is adopting a new principle of ""treating adult users like adults."" As part of that policy, he said ChatGPT will roll out age-gated ""erotica"" for verified users in December.
Altman said that OpenAI previously made ChatGPT ""pretty restrictive to make sure we were being careful with mental health issues.""
""Now that we have been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues and have new tools, we are going to be able to safely relax the restrictions in most cases,"" he wrote.
Altman has previously signaled hesitancy around sexually explicit use of AI. Two months ago, Altman told Cleo Abram that there were several decisions that could ""juice growth and revenue,"" but that don't align with OpenAI's values. Abrams asked for an example.
""We haven't put a sex-bot avatar in ChatGPT yet,"" Altman said.
Abram said that it ""does seem like it would get time spent."" Altman responded, ""Apparently it does.""
Some of OpenAI's competitors have already made the jump into erotica. In June, Elon Musk's xAI released Ani, a lingerie-wearing anime girl companion. One user told Business Insider that he fell in love with Ani.
Grok Imagine, xAI's video generator, also launched a ""spicy"" mode where users can disrobe images of people.
While ChatGPT has historically barred sexual conversations, many users already discuss love and romance with the chatbot. Some users draft messages to loved ones with the chatbot, or ask it to analyze their text conversations.
In September, OpenAI released a study about how people use ChatGPT. It showed that 1.9% of ChatGPT messages were about ""relationships and personal reflections.""

Rigetti Computing’s stock rose by 25% yesterday after JPMorgan Chase’s announcement of a $10 billion “Security and Resiliency Initiative” aimed at 27 industries and technologies, including quantum computing. This news boosted the entire quantum computing sector, resulting in similar increases for peers such as D-Wave Quantum and IonQ.
The momentum of the stock has been remarkable—returns of 185% in the past month. This surge reinforces our earlier argument regarding the potential for RGTI stock to increase tenfold, as discussed in our recent coverage.
That said, if you’re looking for upside with lower volatility than holding a single stock like RGTI, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has delivered returns surpassing 105% since its inception. Why is this the case? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded better returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index, providing a steadier investment experience, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Separately, see – How BBAI Stock Rises To $20?
JPMorgan’s significant capital investment indicates institutional faith in the commercial viability of quantum computing. The initiative’s emphasis on U.S. technological leadership implies ongoing support for the sector. RGTI’s position in this context offers real upside potential, especially if the company can secure a substantial share of incoming capital.
The 185% monthly return, though remarkable, does not necessarily suggest overextension if the adoption of quantum computing occurs more rapidly than current market expectations.
Nevertheless, three critical factors require consideration:
It is crucial to understand that investing in a single stock without thorough analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to generate strong returns for investors. What accounts for this? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks has provided an effective strategy to capitalize on favorable market conditions while reducing losses when markets decline, as outlined in RV Portfolio performance metrics.
RGTI represents a high-risk, high-reward opportunity. The JPMorgan catalyst is substantial, and further gains are likely given the structural growth trajectory of quantum computing. However, the balance of risk and reward has changed following the recent surge. Investors must weigh RGTI’s momentum against its susceptibility to volatility. Those looking to invest at this time should adjust their position sizes accordingly, acknowledging that both the scenario of a tenfold increase and the scenario of downside risk remain viable. This stock is not suitable for risk-averse portfolios."

All of the Grow A Garden Gear Shop stock, listed by price, as well as descriptions of what each item does.

Eloise is the proprietor of the Grow A Garden Gear Shop, and the selection of items she has for sale ranges from handy to essential. Some tools allow you to reconfigure your garden, harvest fruits from a single plant, or salvage seeds to replant them later. However, she also very occasionally has top-tier sprinklers that increase the size and mutation chance for your plants, and lollipops you can feed to your pets to level them up.
It’s not just those items that can be handy to purchase. For example, your Grow A Garden pets will benefit greatly from having a tasty treat to snack on, while some items are used to make sprays that give you the power to spread Grow A Garden mutations. You can use them to craft other items of note, such as lightning rods to inflict the Shocked mutation on specific plants or Anti Bee eggs to hatch rarer pets. Here’s everything you need to know about the Grow A Garden Gear Shop’s stock.
Of the options available in the Gear Shop, the most useful ones are the rare ones: namely, the Master or Grandmaster Sprinklers, Level-up Lollipops, and Medium Treats and Toys. The Sprinklers boost the growth and mutation rates over a wider radius for a short time, while the Levelup Lollipops, Medium Treats, and Medium Toys are for buffing your pets.
All the gear in this shop is one-time-use items, so you need to purchase multiple copies if you want to keep using them. Any of the more expensive ones will rarely be available to buy unless one of the admins restocks them during the Admin Abuse events, so make sure that you attend those an hour before the next Grow A Garden update happens.
Here is the full list of products that can be available in Eloise’s Grow A Garden Gear Shop:
There is also a handful of gear you can craft at the dedicated crafting bench next to the Cosmetics shop. The list below relates to the gear-specific recipes on the right-hand bench, while the left-hand one is specifically for creating hybrid seeds.
Redirects lightning 3 times before being destroyed during Thunderstorm weather. (Crafting time: 45 minutes)
Redirects sun beams 10 times before being destroyed during Heat Wave weather. (Crafting time: 45 minutes)
Reclaims plants, turning them into seeds. (Crafting time: 25 minutes)
Gives a fruit the Choc mutation. (Crafting time: 12 minutes)
Hatches Anti Bee pets. (Crafting time: 2 hours)
Gives your pet a small boost to their passive ability. (Crafting time: 10 minutes)

Pet with the following passive ability:Increases backpack size by 30 and occasionally pollinates nearby fruit. (Crafting time: 4 hours).

I know, I know. This levitating stock market feels like a bubble that will burst any day.
So I get it if you’re nervous. And that’s actually a good thing. It pays to be wary when everyone else is throwing money at any asset—stocks included.
My take? Well, it might surprise you, but it’s this: We’re not in a bubble—AI-driven or otherwise.
But I get the fear—which is why we’re going to look at a two-step move that addresses it. This “best of both worlds” play gives us yields up to 8.2% and a hedge if, say, bullish analysts (like me!) end up wrong and the so-called “AI bubble” pops.
Like I said, I think that’s unlikely. But in any market, it always pays to spread out our risks, which is why I think this two-step move makes a lot of sense now.
You don’t have to look far to see what’s driving bubble worries. Over the last six months, stocks have soared 32.4%, or 65% annualized. There’s no way that can continue.
Right?
This perspective keeps people out of stocks, but we need to zoom out. Over the long haul, stocks have done well (but not too well) no matter when you bought them.
Over the last decade, stocks have risen 12.9% on average per year. That’s above the century-long average of 10.5%, but not far above. And a higher gain now than in, say, the 1930s, makes sense. After all, our technology is better, and our companies are more efficient. So why shouldn’t stocks rise a bit faster than they used to?
So, at the very least, we can say that the last decade has been very good for stocks, but not bubbly. To see what a real bubble looks like, let’s flip back 30 years or so.
From 1996 to 2000, stocks returned 24.3% annualized. But most important, that was after several years of strong performance. Meantime, our recent strong market comes after two big selloffs: first due to the pandemic in 2020, and second due to misplaced recession fears in 2022.
So a bit of short-term outperformance to offset short-term underperformance makes sense. And that’s before we talk about AI.
I had a chat with an old friend who’s now the head of the English department at a small liberal-arts school. He was telling me that he doesn’t know how to plan the curriculum for the upcoming school year because, as he put it, “All anyone wants to talk about is artificial intelligence.”
If even liberal-arts schools are obsessed over AI, should we worry that we’re in a bubble? If you look at Google Trends for the phrase “AI bubble,” you can see that, well, there is a bubble of worry about AI.
No wonder the AI-bubble case is capturing the thinking of banks, private equity investors and journalists.
But let’s stress test this assumption. Our first stop? The CNN Fear and Greed Index.
A lack of greed has led to a “neutral” reading, or a market where the fears of bubble prognosticators and the hopes of pollyanna-ish speculators cancel each other out. This is a realistic indicator that, no, we’re not in a bubble—at least not at the inflationary peak of the bubble cycle.
A lot of data is telling us that the economy is strong and inflation is high—and that’s not me talking, it’s Apollo Investment’s chief economist, who makes this argument clearly with a slew of charts. Let me just share what I think is the most important point.
If Americans’ fear about their jobs is declining and well off earlier peaks (see the far right side of the above chart), we’re far from a situation where this harms the economy. I’m not saying that will never happen—just that it isn’t coming soon.
Moreover, a recent study has shown AI isn’t taking jobs.
“The labor market doesn’t feel great, so it feels correct that AI is taking people’s jobs,” says Martha Gimbel, one of the Yale academics who authored the study. “But we’ve looked at this many, many different ways, and we really cannot find any sign that this is happening.”
So, what is happening? In short, AI is boosting corporate profits.
Over the long-term, we’ve seen earnings growth on a steady upward track, with the pandemic breaking that trend. But setting that aside, we’re back on that trend.
In part, that’s thanks to things getting back to normal (hence the big jump in late 2021 and early 2022), but it’s also partly due to the 10% earnings rise in the past year, far above the 6.7% annual earnings growth of the S&P 500 over the last 50 years.
In other words, stocks are rising more now because profits are doing the same, and technology will likely cause that trend to continue.
Nonetheless, if you’re still concerned we’re in a bubble, I have a solution: a closed-end fund (CEF) that sells covered-call options.
Under these deals, the fund sells investors the right to buy its stocks when they hit a certain price at a fixed future date. No matter what happens, the fund keeps the fee it charges for this and uses it to fund its dividend.
It’s a strategy that does best in volatile markets. So if you hold a fund that invests in the S&P 500 broadly, you have a nice setup for gains in an up market and a bit of a hedge in a down one—say if we do see some short-term correction around AI.
That leads us to the Nuveen S&P 500 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (SPXX), which yields 7.7%—handing us a nice “cash cushion” in the form of that high dividend. It also owns the S&P 500, so you’re getting a nice mix of large cap AI players, like Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL), and those that benefit from AI, like Visa (V).
The problem with the covered-call strategy is that it can cap our upside in the long run, as the fund’s best stocks are sold, or “called away.”
That’s why I prefer the 8.2%-yielding Liberty All-Star Growth Fund (ASG), a “pure” equity CEF that’s a holding in my CEF Insider service. This one not only has a strong long-term track record (it’s up over 200% in the last decade, including dividends) but has both increased regular payouts and paid out some huge special dividends, too.
Sure, that dividend does float a bit, but that’s because it’s tied to the fund’s underlying performance. It’s actually a good setup as it gives management latitude to reinvest its profits without worrying about being tied to a fixed payout.
That, in turn, drives further upside for us.
Moreover, as I write this, ASG trades at an 8.2% discount to NAV, which is much more generous than its historical average of 2.2%. That puts additional upside (beyond the stock market’s future gains) on the table as that discount returns to normal.
It’s a sweet setup that lets us ride further AI gains and grab big dividends, too—something those who limit themselves to mainstream AI stocks simply can’t get.

BigBear.ai (NYSE: BBAI), which specializes in AI solutions for national security, has achieved outstanding returns, soaring over 70% in just a month to exceed $9 per share, including a 22% gain in a single day after its most recent strategic announcement. Last month, we discussed the potential for BBAI stock to rise from $5 to $10. With the stock now approaching these thresholds, attention turns to whether it can double again to surpass $20.
We will explore these factors in the following sections. That being said, if you’re looking for an upside with less volatility than investing in individual stocks, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark, which includes a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—achieving returns exceeding 105% since its launch. Why is this the case? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index, resulting in a smoother investment journey, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
The recent surge was sparked by BigBear.ai's strategic alliance with Tsecond, Inc., announced on October 13, 2025, aimed at providing AI-enabled edge infrastructure for mission-critical operations. This partnership will allow U.S. national security agencies to implement AI more quickly and reliably at the tactical edge by streamlining the deployment and management of AI. The agreement signifies a considerable endorsement of BigBear.ai's technology in the increasingly vital field of battlefield AI deployment, where speed and dependability are crucial. Edge computing capabilities for defense applications are becoming indispensable as military operations demand real-time AI decision-making in contested environments with limited connectivity.
Numerous risks could obstruct BigBear.ai’s journey to $20. Recent financial reports indicated second-quarter 2025 revenue of $32.5 million, a decrease of $7.3 million year-over-year, mainly due to disruptions in Army programs, signaling vulnerability to delays or cancellations of programs. Revenue variability continues to be a concern due to the project-based nature of government contracts and unpredictable procurement timelines. The company confronts fierce competition from larger defense contractors and well-capitalized AI firms entering the defense sector. The stock's recent rapid ascent also introduces technical risks of consolidation or profit-taking before establishing a new base for further gains. Additionally, examine our analysis of downside risk for BBAI stock.
Keep in mind, investing in a single stock without thorough analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stock benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to deliver strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive approach to leverage positive market conditions while limiting losses during downturns, as outlined in RV Portfolio performance metrics.
The journey to $20+ for BigBear.ai relies on successful execution across various fronts. The Tsecond partnership affirms the company’s technology at a pivotal moment for defense AI adoption, while the $385 million backlog establishes a foundation for ongoing revenue growth. The combination of rising DoD AI budgets, strategic partnerships, and potential operational leverage constructs a compelling scenario for another doubling from the current levels. However, investors must assess this upside against the notable execution risks and revenue volatility inherent in government contracting. The recent 73% surge has already incorporated a significant level of optimism—additional gains will necessitate that the company effectively converts its backlog and showcases improved profitability as it scales."

Bitfarms stock (NASDAQ: BITF) is currently on an impressive 8-day winning streak, driving a massive 93% total return and boosting the company's market capitalization to approximately $3.0 billion—an increase of nearly $2.8 billion during the rally. This phenomenal rise makes its 261.7% year-to-date return dwarf the S&P 500's 13.1%. 
The primary driver for this investor enthusiasm is Bitfarms' strategic pivot toward providing High-Performance Computing (HPC) and AI infrastructure services. By leveraging its existing data center and energy assets for the high-demand AI sector, the company is attracting significant new interest beyond its traditional business of cryptocurrency mining (validating Bitcoin transactions) and its minor segment of electrician services in Quebec, Canada.
BITF stock has seen considerable growth recently, making it currently appear risky. While this might seem like a warning, there are substantial risks associated with relying on a single stock. Nevertheless, there is immense value in the diversified approach we adopt with the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Separately, see – What's Happening With RGTI Stock?
The table below highlights the return for BITF stock compared to the S&P 500 index over various periods, including the current streak:
What is the point? Momentum often signals increasing confidence. A multi-day win streak can indicate a rise in investor confidence or trigger further buying. Observing such patterns can help you capitalize on this momentum or get ready for a strategically timed entry if the momentum is lost.
Currently, there are 8 S&P constituents with 3 or more consecutive days of gains and 77 constituents that have experienced 3 or more consecutive days of losses.
While BITF stock appears appealing due to its winning streak, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be perilous. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics."

Oura announced today that it has secured over $900 million in a new funding round, catapulting its valuation to a hefty $11 billion.
That’s a huge leap for a brand that started out a decade ago trying to make sleep tracking cool. The money will help Oura double down on AI-driven innovation, expand its health platform, and get its smart rings into more hands around the world.
CEO Tom Hale says the new funding proves how far the company’s vision of “proactive health” has come. In his words, it’s not just about tracking sleep or heart rate anymore — it’s about helping people understand their bodies, make smarter lifestyle choices, and connect data with healthcare providers.
Oura's momentum definitely backs up that vision. The company recently crossed 5.5 million rings sold, with more than half of those shipped just in the past year. It doubled its revenue in 2024 to over $500 million, and is on track to top $1 billion in 2025.
 



Alongside the funding news, Oura is shaking up its leadership. Longtime board member David Shuman is stepping in as chair of the board, taking over from Eurie Kim, who’s held the position since 2019.
The board is also expanding to include Wen Hsieh from Matter Venture Partners, an engineer and investor with deep hardware chops who’s expected to help guide Oura's next phase of product innovation.
And yes, the company’s still making moves on the product front. Oura recently rolled out its Oura Ring 4 Ceramic, a more durable take on its flagship wearable, along with the Charging Case, its first real hardware accessory. It also added Health Panels, which let users schedule lab tests and view results directly in the app.
Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android
These updates follow other software tweaks focused on sleep, readiness, and activity tracking, underscoring Oura's shift from fitness gadget to full-on health platform.
With sales and revenue climbing fast, Oura is clearly building more than just a piece of jewelry — it’s building a health ecosystem. And with nearly a billion in new funding to fuel expansion, the company’s next challenge might be more about staying ahead in a wearables market it helped redefine.

    This premium series of desktop PCs, created in collaboration with Havn, offer three pricey configs with cutting-edge gaming specs.
  
The mighty Doom Series PC is contained within a limited-edition Havn case.
Maingear revealed its newest custom-built gaming PCs, the Doom Series, which serve as an ode to one of the most iconic first-person shooter games of all time. Created in collaboration with Havn, each computer comes with a custom case and internal components.
The Doom Series is a limited-edition drop: After debuting on Oct. 14, only 50 will be sold and shipped out across all of its available configurations. If you're a Doom fan in the market for a new high-performance gaming setup, this desktop PC doubles as a cutting-edge collectible.
Every config is packaged within Havn's HS 420 Doom: The Dark Ages-themed case, which features red Doom Slayer iconography and LED lighting. Inside the case, you'll find Doom-related imagery with custom brackets holding up Nvidia 50-series GPUs and braided red cables that fit the overall theme. In an admittedly very cool combination of form and function, every Doom Series build includes a TRYX Panorama SE 360 liquid cooler with an LCD that loops Doom gameplay highlights.
Maingear offers three pre-built configurations for the Doom Series. However, if those particular builds are a little too rich for your blood, lower-end builds start at $1,999 on Maingear's website.
The three main configs are fun nods to classic Doom difficulty settings: You can get a Hurt Me Plenty build for $2,999, an Ultra-Violence build for $3,999 or a Nightmare build for $5,999. Forget about those in-game demons, because those prices are the truly scary threat.
Here's everything you need to know about the three main Doom Series configurations:
The lowest-priced Doom Series configuration is $2,999. At that price, you're still getting a top-of-the-line gaming PC, but you'll make small sacrifices when compared to the Ultra-Violence and Nightmare builds.
The Hurt Me Plenty config comes with an Nvidia RTX 5070 GPU and an AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D CPU. It also includes an MSI X870E Gaming Plus WiFi motherboard, 32GB of DDR5-6000RAM, a T-Force A440 Pro 1TB SSD and a 650-watt MSI power supply.
The middle option costs $3,999 and bumps you up to an Nvidia RTX 5080 GPU and an AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU. It also comes with an ASRock PG X870E Nova WiFi motherboard, 64GB of RAM, a 2TB SSD and an 850-watt power supply.
The highest-end Doom Series configuration at $5,999 places it at a price far above the other two on offer. The internal specs are also a cut above the other Doom Series builds.
This build comes with an Nvidia RTX 5090 GPU and an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D CPU. The Nightmare config shares some specs with the Ultra-Violence config, including the ASRock motherboard, the 64GB of RAM and a 2TB SSD. This configuration allows for even greater expansion overhead with a 1,250-watt power supply.
The limited nature and high price of the Doom Series mean it's built with a niche audience in mind. I certainly think it'd be cool to have a Doom Slayer PC with an LCD screen looping gameplay inside my rig, but I don't think it's ""$3,000 or more cool."" Then again, I'm not a deep-pocketed, die-hard Doom fan. 
With Maingear making only 50 of these rigs, perhaps they'll retain some collector value to help you justify the high price. And for the non-collector, the Doom Series config offers top-of-the-line components that also help explain the fearsome pricing."

This is Masters in Business with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio
Barry Ritholtz: On the latest Masters in Business podcast. An amazing conversation. I sit down with Jurrien Timmer. He’s the director of Global Macro at Fidelity. They touch about 50 million separate clients. What an amazing conversation. Yian has been started out in fixed income before he became a a market technician. Now, global macro is his beat, which means he covers everything, US overseas equity, bonds, commodities, economic data. I, I thought this conversation was fascinating, and I think you will also what a depth and breadth of knowledge. With no further ado my conversation with Fidelity’s y and Teer. Yuri and Teer, welcome to Bloomberg.
Jurrien Timmer: Thank you very much, Barry.
Barry Ritholtz: I’ve been looking forward to this. I’ve been consuming your stuff for, it feels like forever. I’m a big fan of what you do. But before we get to your work at Fidelity for the past three decades, let’s talk a little bit about your background. You get a bachelor’s in finance from Babson College. What was the original career plan?
Jurrien Timmer: Well, so I was born and raised on the island of Aruba in 1962 when Aruba was still very small and sheltered, and as a Dutch citizen, now, also an American citizen. But you know, generally the kid, the Dutch kids would go to Holland to go to higher education. But I was in love with the American culture. I met many tourists on the beach, you know, and so I wanted to go to the States and do the American thing. And then my father, who was an importer of construction materials, et cetera, he had contacts in Boston. He said, okay, well, you should send your, your kid to Babson because it’s small, it won’t be overwhelmed as a, as an international student. And I’ve always wanted to be an architect. But then in the last year before finishing high school, I’m like, I don’t think I’m good enough to be an architect, so let me do business.
And I figured, you know, there’s always something you can do with a business degree. And so I studied finance with a minor in investments. And then, you know, I graduated with no work permit, right? So I, I was in that place where you need to have obviously a work permit. So back then, I don’t know if it’s still the case, but back then you got one year practical training visa, and then you had to go, you know, get a, get a real, a real visa. And so I took literally the only job that was offered to me in the United States. So I applied to every Dutch company. I figured at least they’ll have maybe some sentimental reasons to hire a Dutch person. I could have worked in Holland, of course, but I wanted to be in the States. So the Dutch bank, A BN, which later became a BN Amro, right, hired me. I went to New York into their corporate banking credit program, in which I had zero interest. But it’s like, you know, this is the job,
Barry Ritholtz: No pun intended, right? But, but you eventually become pretty senior in the fixed income group at A BN.
Jurrien Timmer: Yeah. So I, I was very lucky. And again, you know, it’s sort of, if you take the job that’s offered to you and you make the best of it, you know, you play the hand that’s dealt. And literally within a few months, a BN set up a capital markets group because, you know, we were the, the primary dealer in New York together with LaSalle National Bank in Chicago for the HQ in Amsterdam, which of course was one of the world’s largest banks at the time, and a very large treasury book. And so I was the person who would execute the, the trades for hq. So I became a client of like Solomon Brothers in Smith Varney, and, and you know, the, you know, Goldman Sachs, et cetera. And so I got into the Wall Street game and I learned everything about fixed income. And to this day, I’m, you know, like if, if you’re a either a stock market person or a global macro person, having a foundation of fixed income is so important.
Barry Ritholtz: It’s so true. You say that some of my favorite stock analysts began as bond analysts because they’re concerned about return of capital, not return on capital. And it focuses them very much on staying away from the speculative nonsense and real. I, it it’s been very consistent over the years. Yep. Yeah, I have a list of, of some favorite people in that space. So, so you start out in fixed income. When did technical analysis and becoming a CMT arise in your journey? So,
Jurrien Timmer: So I was at ABN Amro in New York for 10 years. And so I’m, you know, I’m there executing trades, learning about the markets, watching my, the tele eight and the Bloombergs were still, they, they were the quad screens with the amber. Right. And, you know, I just, I’ve always been a visual person. And so I started gravitating towards charts and, you know, charts are kind of the mainstay of what I do even now, 40 years later.
Barry Ritholtz: 40 years later? That’s Crazy
Jurrien Timmer:  Yeah. And I, I like to write, I think I get that from my dad, who’s a great writer. And so I always had this kind of urge to put pen to paper and, and to show charts. And so I, I just started writing a newsletter for the, the people in my universe at the time. And, you know, it would be like charts from CQG cut out taped onto a, a type report and then faxed to people. Like that’s what the technology was back then. And so it was all, so that’s how it started. And then I ended up, you know, getting the, the charted market technician, although that may have been during the Fidelity years,
Barry Ritholtz: I think. So, so how did you go from AB=N Amro to Fidelity? When was that?
Jurrien Timmer: So the culture at ABN Amro, not, not to spill any beans, but this was a long time ago, 30 years ago, I didn’t like where it was going. So we, we A BN had a, a bank in Chicago, and they saw what a profit center in New York was. So they wanted to, they wanted me to work for them, become a commission salesman. And I’m like, it’s likes not what I do. And just coincidentally, at that time, fidelity came looking around looking for the most obscure job in the world, a a fixed income technical analyst, right? I mean, talk about a narrow field, right? Right. Very specific. So that was in 1994. Around that time, you know, I was kind of looking around and, and I had two major career highlights within six months of each other because in 94, I was approached by Paul Tudor Jones’s company. Oh, really? And so I had a meeting with Paul in his office downtown New York, with this giant ADE on the screen, and we were looking at the bond chart, 94, the bear market, right.
Barry Ritholtz: And he very famously had called the 87 crash before,
Jurrien Timmer: And he was like, is that, do you think that’s a fourth wave? And we were having that conversation, that was great. And then, you know, I was approached by Fidelity and I ended up going with Fidelity, but the last interview of that process was with Ned Johnson. Oh, really? And so I was, spent,
Barry Ritholtz: The founder,
Jurrien Timmer: I spent an hour with him in his office talking about Parkers, because I was hired to go into the chart room. And at Fidelity, nobody got into the chart room without Ned’s blessing. ,
Barry Ritholtz: Right. Because back then, were they still doing charts by hand? Yep. Amazing.
Jurrien Timmer: And so, so that, so that, anyway, so that’s how the Fidelity career started. And it was, it was interesting because this is now early 95, and of course 94 was that bear market. We had the, the so-called tequila crisis in Mexico. And so the, the new mandate from upstairs in 95 was, we’re not making any duration bets. You just stick to your bottom up. You know, you, you look at credits and like, I’m coming in there as a technician and like, what, what am I supposed to do now? Like, there really is nothing for me to do. And so at that point, I kind of reinvented myself and became multi, multi asset, and I went to the equity side. And anyway, so that was the start of
Barry Ritholtz: The point, when you say multi-asset, I, I think you’re the only person in all of finance with the title director of global macro global means around the world, macro means 30,000 foot view. Yep. Is everything out there in your jurisdiction?
Jurrien Timmer: Pretty much. So I don’t do security selection. I, you know, we have armies of very talented,
Barry Ritholtz: But you do stocks, bonds, alts, crypto, commodities, gold,
Jurrien Timmer: You name it, I do everything, but it’s top down
Barry Ritholtz: As well as economic data. Yes. Interest rates. Yes. Employment, et cetera.
Jurrien Timmer: And, and that’s how I transitioned from being a technical strategist to being more kind of multidisciplinary, because I quickly learned at Fidelity as I was roaming the halls, pitching ideas to, to portfolio managers who generally are fundamentally oriented, right? I’m like, you know, I’m, it’s like I’m speaking a different language, right? So Fidelity’s always had a lot of technical, a analysts and the chart room, but I, I had to like, reinvent myself again and pivot towards at least speaking their language. And like, you know, a chart is a chart, right? It can just be a bar chart of, of the s and p, or it could be of the PE ratio or earnings or monetary policy. So I figured a chart’s a chart, I’m gonna like weave a broader approach to this. And, and that’s where kind of I came up with the title.
Barry Ritholtz: Whenever I see a, a technician and a fundamental analyst having a discussion somewhere along the line, someone says, “Look, I’m a a technical analyst. I’m just telling you what’s going on in the battle between supply and demand. It’s up to you to create a narrative around that. You tell us what’s going on. Fundamentally, I don’t know, but I could tell you who’s winning the buyers or the sellers.”
Jurrien Timmer: The fundamentals tell you kind of the why, maybe the what and the why, and the technicals tell you kind of the when and the how much it, it helps give you conviction. And generally speaking, we use technical analysis like our equity PMs do. Like, they’re obviously gonna have an idea about a company and what their long-term prospects are. But then our technical analysts will, will say, okay, well you’ve rated this stock a one meaning strong buy, but the chart looks like hell. Like you, you should be aware that the what’s in what’s happening is not the same as what should be happening. And maybe it takes time, but it’s like, it’s a, it’s a second opinion, which can be very helpful. And the other way around as well, like a chart looks amazing, but it gets a really poor fundamental ranking. And we also have a quantitative team that does a quant overlay as well.
Barry Ritholtz: We talked about global macro. I’m curious, you’re a Dutch citizen originally born and raised in Aruba, now a citizen of the US for the past 25 years. How does that international upbringing affect how you see the entire world of assets?
Jurrien Timmer: Yeah, it’s, it’s a great question. I, I do think that I am, I’ve been privileged to grow up in a very diverse environment. Like if you look at old high school pitchers, I’m like, maybe one of two white kids in there, right? Everyone else is different shades. But so very, very diverse. And, and, and so I think, and, and also just going to different countries and learning different cultures or being exposed to them, I think it’s helped me, like I view myself sort of as a global citizen. Well,
Barry Ritholtz:  You’re a globetrotter. You’re, you’re, you’re in the us you were in California, you’re in New York, Boston, you’re going to where, what’s your next few stops? London.
Jurrien Timmer: I’m flying to London on Saturday. I’ll be in Geneva after that. And then
Barry Ritholtz: We were just in Lake Geneva a year ago. Spectacular.
Jurrien Timmer: And then actually we’re going to Holland because my parents are, they live in the Hague. They’re celebrating their 70th wedding anniversary. Wow, that’s amazing. So they’re, they’re 91 and 97. Wow. So we got three generations of Tim descending on the Hague. That’s incredible. In about, in about a week and a half. And, and I, like, I think what I, I, I feel at home in almost any place, really in the world. And you know, when, when it’s hard to understand what someone says, because the English is not their first language. You, you can kind of like, you, you figure it out because you just kind of used to this, you know, this environment where everyone’s coming from different places and, and like, you know, even now, like I, I run, and this is totally separate topic, but I run a food camp at Burning Man, and it’s a very global camp. We have 90 people. We’re all cook meals that we gift away to the artists there, but we have like 30 Brazilians and we have like French and Swiss and Mexican people and obviously Americans. And, and that like, it’s, it’s easy to do because you’re just used to having all these different cultures in, in the same space.
Barry Ritholtz: I’m kind of fascinated by the new earbuds Apple earbuds; I don’t love the fit of earbuds. They’re not comfortable in my ear. But the new AI enabled instant translation. Yeah. That is Star Trek next level. Yeah. It’s very cool. Futuristic. I, I can see that saying, oh, you want to go to Japan or Korea or China, here you go. Knock yourself out.That, that sort of technological innovation is that turns that into a must have technology. [Yeah. Yep, for sure]. How many languages do you speak?
Jurrien Timmer: I speak, obviously Dutch is my native language. English. I used to be totally fluent in Spanish, but I’ve, I’ve kinda lost that. And then of course there’s the world language called Papiamento, which is what they speak in Aruba, which is essentially kind of a Spanish Portuguese blend. But if you don’t know a word, you can just say it in Dutch or English and it makes, and they’ll, and, and it’s completely acceptable.
Barry Ritholtz: Really fascinating. We were talking about what a globe trotter you are. Let, let’s trot around the world and talk about various asset classes since you began your career with bonds. Let’s, let’s start with bonds. How do you see what’s been going on with treasury yields anticipating not only the 25 basis cut point we had in September, but perhaps a couple more this year and next?
Jurrien Timmer:Yeah, so, so treasury yields such an interesting market right now. We’ve been stuck sort of between four and 5% for a while.
And when we go above four and a half, it’s like nothing good happens. Like the, the old fed model from the Greenspan days comes lurking back and right, it starts to wobble the stock market because the bond yield and the equity yield are about the same right now. And, and so that, that takes you back to the, the eighties and, and, you know, mid nineties and even the seventies and sixties where bonds to stocks were positively correlated instead of negatively correlated. That happened. That, that began, you know, during the great moderation era, late nineties until COVID basically. And so then in 2022, of course the correlation flipped back to positive. It was rising yields that caused the problem in the stock market. And, and so there’s a whole broader conversation about the 60 40, but just dealing with treasuries right now. So as you get close to five, it really starts to freak the stock market out, but also the bond buyers start to emerge. ’cause there’s value, right? I mean, real, real rates are
Barry Ritholtz:  Positive. 5% yields over two and a half percent inflation.
Jurrien Timmer: You’re actually making income is back into fixed income, right? But down at four, when you have a gross scare, kind of like, I mean, I wouldn’t say it’s a gross scare, but the jobs Market.
Barry Ritholtz:  But there, there’s some nervousness and some la I hate the word uncertainty, but there’s a lack of clarity as to how all these things tariffs yield FOMC plays out.
Jurrien Timmer: So, so at four, generally I would be a better seller than, than a buyer. But this question of, you know, fiscal dominance, you know, clearly the administration wants to grow out of the debt. I think that’s the very overt plan. If you’ve listened to Scott Bessant or even they’re
Barry Ritholtz: Pretty explicit about it.
Jurrien Timmer: And so they’re trying to goose the economy and outrun the debt because everyone knows you can’t really cut the debt very much because too much of the budget is unre is not discretionary. And so that’s the plan. And I think it’s basically, it’s a good plan because what are the alternatives, right?
Barry Ritholtz: Raising taxes and cutting spending, which we know what the odds of that happening.
Jurrien Timmer: Yes. But running kind of that fiscal train means deficit spending, or at least that’s part of it. And that means more supply. And that could mean higher term premium for, for long treasuries. And we saw, we’ve seen that, right? The term premium during the qa, qe financial repression days was like minus one 50, which makes no sense, right? Term, right. A risk premium should always be positive. And now it’s plus 60 plus 70, but historically it’s been plus 150 or even more. And so if, if the term premium mean reverts back to a normal level, positive level because deficit spending and debt levels are rising, you could easily see a five handle on treasuries, huh. And a five handle on treasuries are not gonna sit well with equities like the, the, the equity market can go up, earnings can drive the bus, but the PE gets under pressure because the risk-free asset is now competing with the risky asset and they’re offering the same yield.
Barry Ritholtz: So, so quick question on that. In the 2010s, or at least towards the end of 2010s, we had an inverted yield curve for a while. What’s the impact of that on that term premium or lack thereof?
Jurrien Timmer: Yeah, so we had that very inverted yield curve, obviously it, it shouted recession and it didn’t happen. And I think the reason in hindsight was that the economy is just less interest rates sensitive than it used to be, right? So everyone refied their mortgage in 2020 and 21 at at sub 3%. That’s also why the housing market is frozen, right? But also, if you look at the big banks, right? Why, why is a yield curve inversion typically bad is because banks net interest margins goes upside down, right? They borrow short, lend long, and so banks stop lending and you get a credit crunch and you get a recession. But in this case, the large banks, you know, if you notice your, your deposit rate at the large mega center banks has not really gone up commensurate with the yield on money market funds, right? That’s right. So that deposit rate went up to a half a percent and is now coming back down again. So for a large bank, the yield curve not only was never inverted, it was extremely steep, half a percent funding, right? If you’re, if you’re funding your loans on deposits and you’re paying half a percent on those deposits, and you can land at seven or 8%, you’ll do that all day long.
Barry Ritholtz: And yet at the same time we’ve watched money markets go 5 trillion, 6 trillion, 7 trillion. It’s become so easy with your app to move money from, Hey, I’m going from Chase to Schwab, I’m going from Citi to Fidelity. Yep. Where I’m getting real yield. I wonder how much technology plays a role in people. It used to be a pain in the neck, oh, I’m getting quarter percent in my checking account, but do I really wanna write a check and mail it out and wait for the,
Jurrien Timmer: Yeah, so, so you leave money at the bank for convenience, you know, you got bills to pay, but if you have extra cash, you’re, you’re buying a CD or, or money market fund or buying TD or what have you. And it’s a lot easier than it used to be. And so now you’ve got 7 trillion in money market funds, which a lot of people actually think is money waiting to be invested in the stock market. But I I, I don’t think there’s really a signal there, because I think that money came out of the banks and probably will go back to the banks at some point.
Barry Ritholtz: So some people have said, Hey, as soon as the Fed starts cutting rates, it’ll a make the cost of borrowing cheaper for corporate America as well as cons American households, and B is gonna scare some of that money away and it’s got nowhere to go. But equity fair narrative or kind of a lot of wishful thinking,
Jurrien Timmer: It could be a combination of both. But if you typically look at when money market fund assets swell like it did during the pandemic, it’s money coming out of the stock market seeking a safe haven, and then when the stock market recovers, the money goes back in the stock market. That’s not the pattern this year. The money came out of the banks in part because of like the Silicon Valley right. Debacle a few years ago
Barry Ritholtz: but also 500 basis points of rate hikes in 2022. So money Markets went from zero to five and a half and suddenly attractive
Jurrien Timmer: And deposits went from zero to half. You know, so money markets yielded 10 x the bank deposit. And so some of that may go to the stock market, but I, but it didn’t come from the stock market, let me put it that way.
Barry Ritholtz:  So you noted something really interesting. I remember you wrote in 2022, bonds went from being a port in the storm to the storm itself. Yes. So normally we think of money leaving equity and going in the safe harbor of money markets. Were we seeing money exiting bonds and going to money markets? Is that what happened? Was it a duration play from among sort of the typical investors?
Jurrien Timmer: We have not really seen an exodus at all. And I think part of that is just the demographics of, you know, the baby boom solving for income more so than growth. So you look at fund flows into fixed income, they, they’ve remained strong and they were strong at, you know, 1% and they’re strong at 4%. So I think that is more of a structural trend than playing the markets, if you will, right? Like I think the average investor is not looking at, okay, well real rates are now positive, so let me do this, but they’re solving for outcomes. They’re buying solutions based funds, right? Like, like our target date will, will have certain amount of fixed income,
00:22:41 [Speaker Changed] Which has just attracted so much money in 4 0 1 Ks over the past 20 years. It’s, it’s amazing. So let’s talk a little bit about equities. I keep hearing people complain about valuations, but if you stayed out of equities due to elevated valuation, you miss most of this run from the 2013 breakout.
00:23:00 [Speaker Changed] Yes. So, so the market obviously is very bifurcated. We got the max seven, the cap weighted PE is, you know, 23, 24, the equal weighted PE is 18. So there’s a very large gap there. You know, if you look back at the mid to late nineties, which is a kind of an an analogous period to today, right? We had the, the 94 stealth bear market when Greenspan raised rates 300 basis points, then he gave back 75 and we had a huge rally. And it was also the start of the internet boom, you know, the Netscape, IPOI think it was like in 96, 96,
00:23:39 [Speaker Changed] Yep.
00:23:40 [Speaker Changed] So the post 2022 period, very analogous to post 1994, you know, soft landing, ease off the, the brakes markets, markets rip, and then the post 98 long-term capital Yep. That, you know, 22% decline, very robust recovery. And then Greenspan eases three times into that recovery. We’re seeing the same thing. Now we had a 21% tariff tantrum, right? No recession, you know, the kind of administration backed off very, very strong, one of the strongest ever recoveries from a 20% decline other than 1998. And then now Powell’s easing into that. And so, but the point is that that period saw almost nonstop multiple expansion. And that’s what we’ve seen since 2022. And you know, PEs are, they have, they are strong predictors of long-term returns. So if you take a 10 year cape ratio and you regress that against 10 year forward returns, you see a very high, you know, it, it explains the forward returns very well.
00:24:48 But over the near term, a high PE has very little to say about the next year or two. And this is because the market tends to be in a rising trend, momentum begets momentum. And that’s what what we’re in. So it’s, it’s a, you know, it, it’s a tough game to time on the mean reversion of PEs valuation, right? Even though we know that historically it’s between 10 and 30 and it does mean revert. But when the mean revert reversion starts, and from what level is very, very difficult to do, especially during secular trends, which I think we’re very clearly in
00:25:26 [Speaker Changed] So, so many different places to, to go with this. I have a dozen questions, maybe we’ll go a little along the segment and, and delve deeper into equities. I love the concept of a secular bull market as opposed to a cyclical, but I think a lot of people don’t really understand the difference. Give us your definition of what is a secular bull market when this one began, and why?
00:25:50 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so we have, so we have the market cycle, which is generally driven by the business cycle. So you have a recession and you have the early cycle recovery where things get less bad. And of course the market is always anticipating that, right? The market’s always in price discovery, and this is why at bottoms price will lead earnings, which is why the p always goes up in the first year of a bull market like it always does. And, and it doesn’t make sense on the surface. People are like, oh, this can’t be real. It’s all PE driven, where are the earnings? Well, the market’s just front running the earnings, right? But then there are the, the secular trends, and you know, if you go back a hundred years, you can see them, you can spot them very easily because the market has a kind of central trend line plus 10% nominal plus seven, six and three quarters real. And if you run a regression trend line against the, the total real return of the s and p or some basket of stocks going back 150 years, it’s like perfect. And then you have the pendulum swinging above it and below it. So you have
00:26:55 [Speaker Changed] Very noisy, but still the overall trend is being maintained. Yeah.
00:26:57 [Speaker Changed] But you have these super cycles where you are outperforming the trend line. So the eighties and nineties was one of those. So instead of a 10% return, we got 18% returns for like 18 years. The fifties and sixties after World War ii, right? The, the twenties, that was a truncated one. But from 20 to 29, boy did that thing go. And since oh nine is where I put it, other technicians generally disagree with me. They think it was 2013, right? When you look at the Cape model, you look at deviation from trend, you look at the slope of those early trend lines, for me it’s oh nine, which puts it as 16. And, and of course, and then you have the secular bear markets, right? So the two thousands was one, the 1970s very famous. Of course, 1930s doesn’t mean the market necessarily goes down, but it it’s underperforming that 10% trend line. And generally in real terms, it’s probably going down. And so that’s kind of how I define the secular trend. So
00:27:55 [Speaker Changed] We are in agreement on so much stuff. I’ll, I’m gonna circle back to oh nine and push back a little bit. Okay. But you mentioned that first year you get a PE spike as the market anticipates improving earnings. One of the things that’s kind of fascinating is to see how much of a bull market’s gains are attributable to not improving fundamentals, but multiple expansion from 82 to 2000, what was it? Three quarters of the gains were multiple expansion. How much of that is psychology and how much of that is just people getting on board late in, in, as the market rallies?
00:28:34 [Speaker Changed] It, it’s, it’s both. But yeah, for instance, in 82 the PE was like seven, right? And in 2000 and
00:28:40 [Speaker Changed] What was the yields in 82,
00:28:41 [Speaker Changed] It is double ditches, almost 20%. A lot of competition. And then in 2000, yes, exactly. And in 2000, the PE was 35 using operating earnings. That, that was the forward pe actually the trailing PE was like 45. Wow. So that’s a hell of a pendulum swing. Yeah. And you know, obviously 1982 inflation was very high. They had the malaise of, in the economy bonds were very competitive. Nobody wanted to pay for earnings. The
00:29:10 [Speaker Changed] Death of equities was just a few years earlier on in business week, the
00:29:13 [Speaker Changed] Death, death of equities. Yes, for sure. And then people become more comfortable, and then they go from comfortable to confident, and then it’s like, yeah, I’m gonna pay, I’m gonna pay 20 or 25 times these earnings. And then of course, then you have the growth, the, the growth stocks. So the late nineties obviously were, were, you know, I I used to call ’em the Janice 20. There was a fund that would just owned, I recall the, the most stocks. And so
00:29:36 [Speaker Changed] I remember the Ryan net net funds
00:29:38 [Speaker Changed] Around that. Yes, exactly. And of course, right now it’s the mag seven, formerly known as the, as the fangs. And those are secular growers, right? And there’s a theme, right? It was internet back then, it’s AI now. And people get onto the, onto the bandwagon and it’s like, yeah, you know, I’ll pay 35 times earnings for a company that is in this space and gonna grow their earnings in a secular way, not a cyclical way. And, and so it’s totally plausible and understandable, but at the end it goes too far. And I don’t think we’re, we’re anywhere close to that. But then you start looking for signs of froth. But yeah, but that’s, that’s the pendulum swing.
00:30:17 [Speaker Changed] So, so let’s talk about oh nine and why so many of your technical brethrens dated to 2013, which was when all of the major indices broke out over their prior trading range. So the pushback I hear to oh nine is, well, that’s like dating the 82 to 2000 bull market to the lows in 73, 74, and you’re still, all you’re doing over that period is recovering the sell off. 23rd, what? We were down 56, 50 7% from October oh seven to March oh nine. And then to get back to where you were in oh seven, it took till 2013. Yeah. Yeah. So, so why oh nine as opposed to 13?
00:31:00 [Speaker Changed] It, it’s totally legit argument, but I would say a couple things. One is, this is not an exact science, right? There’s only been two or three or four secular bull markets, right? It’s
00:31:14 [Speaker Changed] Small dataset,
00:31:15 [Speaker Changed] Small dataset. It’s, it’s not a quant model. You have to look at the chart at the slope. So I date this, the secular bull market from the fifties. I date at 49, even though 49 was not the low, right? The middle, the low was
00:31:30 [Speaker Changed] 46, 44, something like
00:31:32 [Speaker Changed] That. But in 49 something changed and, and the slope started to, you know, like the market found itself. And, and, and that trajectory started to really compound at double digits. And you broke out of that big shelf that was really from 29 all the way to 49 seventies. The low was of course in 74, October 74, after 48% bear market, we had some other little cycles, but then in 82 it took off. There was a change in the fundamentals, you know, Volcker broke inflation. And so, and then you look at the ca so then I get verification from the fundamentals. So then, so I look at the charts and yes, I, I see the, the argument, and I agreed it, it’s a good point. But in oh nine, the market just went straight up. After a decade of sideways in 82, the market went straight up after a decade of sideways. I see in 49, same thing, whether the low was in or not. And of course, in real terms, the 82 low was below the 74 low. So
00:32:38 [Speaker Changed] ’cause of inflation, you really felt so, so,
00:32:40 [Speaker Changed] So
00:32:40 [Speaker Changed] Tremendously in the
00:32:41 [Speaker Changed] Seventies. So I, so I wanna get second opinions from the real chart and from the fundamentals. So the cape model, again, where you compare the 10 year PE to the 10 year forward return looks very similar at the oh nine and not similar at the 13 when the market already had a lot of momentum. And then the other thing I look at, again, that 150 year regression trend line of the real s and p
00:33:06 [Speaker Changed] 150 years.
00:33:07 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And so at the, at secular peaks, the market is about a hundred percent above the trend line. And at secular troughs it’s about 50% below. So that point was in oh nine, it was not in 13. So, so, so I look at, at at, at like the weight of the evidence from a multitude of indicators. And again, it’s, it’s not an exact science, right? I’m not saying I’m right, they’re wrong, but that’s, for me, that’s where I get,
00:33:33 [Speaker Changed] But you’ve been a whole lot more right. Than ro than many other people.
00:33:37 [Speaker Changed] So, well, and, and it, and it’s interesting. So in oh nine, you know, I I was actually running a, a fund back then, a, a kind of a global macro fund, and I was like, the market was so depressed, right? So remember March of oh nine? Sure, of course. And I’m like, you know, I wanna be long, but what if I’m wrong? And I’m like, at this point, if I’m wrong,
00:34:00 [Speaker Changed] So what, you’re already down 50, cut in half. Well,
00:34:02 [Speaker Changed] But at that, at that point, the whole system is gonna collapse. So it’s like why, why not? Why not bet at at that point? And so
00:34:12 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. When is down more than 50% in US markets not a great entry point. Yeah, exactly. I mean that, that’s one thing. But I have to ask you a question about oh oh nine. So I was looking through some of my old notes as I was preparing for this, and I have, I’m curious as to your thoughts on some of the behavioral aspects, including sentiment and bull bear ratios. I wrote something up in October oh nine calling that recovery, the most hated bull market in market history markets went straight up, everybody was miserable. It’s a head fake, it’s a false breakout. This is all gonna be a disaster. And if you listen to those people, you left a ton of money on the table. Yeah. What’s your thought on that extreme sentiment in one direction or the other? And just what it means when everybody hates a particular asset class,
00:35:06 [Speaker Changed] It’s obviously an opportunity because that means that everyone is not on the same side of, of, of, of the boat. Right. And, and actually and what I was,
00:35:13 [Speaker Changed] Or they’re all on the wrong side of
00:35:15 [Speaker Changed] The boat. Yeah. But before I answered the rest of that, I went, I, what I was gonna say earlier was when you run the regression of the oh nine to present s and p, either in real or nominal terms, and you run the same regression from 82 to 2000, from 49 to 68, it’s exactly the same slope. And, and, and so if in oh nine I got bullish and in 13 I’m like, yeah, now we’ve taken out the high. So now we can say this bull market is confirmed. So the 13 for me is not the start, but it’s confirmation. It’s
00:35:49 [Speaker Changed] Confirmation.
00:35:50 [Speaker Changed] But if I had looked at nothing else for the la for the next, you know, 12 years today, I would be within 10% of that slope. Wow. Having materialized. And so again, you’re never gonna do that on, on a secular chart. You wanna have weight of the evidence, but it shows you how powerful that context can be to just look at those different timeframes and see where they are. ’cause it, it’ll keep you on the right side of the market. So
00:36:20 [Speaker Changed] Last question on equities, given the 49 to 66 rally, the 82 to 2000, and then the oh nine forward, how much legs does this secular bull market have? Can can this go another 5, 6, 7 years? And the other related question is how much of a reset does that giant fiscal stimulus of 20 21, 22 build into into markets?
00:36:51 [Speaker Changed] It’s, it’s a great question. And so on the surface of it, we’re 16 years in the last two were 18 years. But again, sample size of two, right? Like you, you can’t go with that. Right? But the Cape model, again, which has been a very good long term model in terms of the 10 year CAGR for the market, suggests that the, so the, the pe the, the growth rate in the PE peaked in 19 for obvious reasons, right? Because it’s a 10 year model. So oh nine rolls off. And then, you know, you have that peak and we’ve been holding steady at around, you know, 14, 15%, 10 year cagr that actually has another peak in about like 20, 26, 7, 8. My guess is that that acceleration will be an AI bubble, or it could be where it’s just like, you know, the AI boom, the mag seven, like all of a sudden everyone’s buying companies with no earnings because they’re promising to be the next killer app, right? And that sort of thing.
00:37:50 [Speaker Changed] The next pets.com.
00:37:51 [Speaker Changed] Yes. And my guess is that if we are heading into a fiscally dominant era, or we’re in it already, so we had 5 trillion of helicopter money in 2020, we now have another $5 trillion fiscal bill. If the next fed post Powell is going to be just more dovish than the economics suggest in order to fund that help fund that debt, then you could see inflation, you know, be structurally higher than 2%, maybe three to four. And if that, and if the 10 year yield at that point goes to a five handle, because the term premium is back, you can easily see a scenario where in a few years can that fed model principle of rising yields bringing down the PE, is gonna be the thing that flattens that secular slope. That doesn’t mean like a two thousands like bear market. It doesn’t have to mean that, but it could just be a flattening instead of running at two x the 10 year rate of change, maybe you’re at half x or something like that. So
00:38:56 [Speaker Changed] Generally speaking, when you see an elevated cape, it’s not a cell signal, it’s really a signal. Lower your future return expectations, things gonna be a little more, a little less easy sledding. Yes,
00:39:07 [Speaker Changed] I think the next 10 years will be less, less robust and the last, but it doesn’t mean they have to be negative at, at all.
00:39:13 [Speaker Changed] You, you mentioned the eighties into the nineties and the post World War II era, it’s kind of fascinated to look at rolling 15 year periods. The, the 15 years following oh nine is the third best 15 year period in history. It’s really amazing. Yep, yep, yep. Coming up we continue our conversation with Yian Timmer, director of global macro at Fidelity, talking about crypto gold commodity alternatives and the state of the economy. I’m Barry Ritholtz, you’re listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio.
00:40:00 I am Barry Ritholtz, your listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. My extra special guest this week is Ian Teer. He is the director of Global Macro at Fidelity Investments, the giant firm helping to manage over $16 trillion in client assets. So, so let’s talk a little bit about the current environment. You, you look at more than just stocks and bonds, you look at a lot of economic data as well and, and chart that. So how do you think where we are in the current economic cycle, how do you describe our location in the business cycle?
00:40:39 [Speaker Changed] So generally speaking, the economy remains pretty solid. People are employed, their wages are exceeding the inflation rate. At this point, debt levels are not high, at least as a percent of GDP. Right? So the household debt to GDP ratio peaked during the financial crisis in
00:40:59 [Speaker Changed] It’s pretty modest in has it’s,
00:41:00 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, it was a hundred percent of GDP, it’s now 70. So there’s a debt issue on the government’s balance sheet, but, but not in the household or even the corporate balance sheet.
00:41:09 [Speaker Changed] Even the government side isn’t our debt to GDP ratio, like half of Japan, something like that.
00:41:15 [Speaker Changed] So about 120% if it’s just a federal debt, if you add all other debt, it’s about 250, but it’s comparable to other regions. But certainly Japan gets the prize and China as well, just in terms of the growth rate of the debt
00:41:32 [Speaker Changed] China. Oh, okay. Not total, but yeah, no, China’s been growing debt and the Chinese provinces have been growing debt
00:41:37 [Speaker Changed] As well. Yeah. And, and the Chinese numbers of course are, can be a little vague because the, the federal debt in China is not high, but they have the four big policy banks that are essentially providing liquidity. And so you have to add that. And so China and Japan are, are the worst offenders. The US is, is on par with most kind of European and other, other countries. But, so anyway, so, so the, the economy looks pretty good, but you know, one of the things that COVID did was it sort of upended a lot of the things we think about when we look at the, at the economic cycle, at the business cycle. So, you know, of course we know what happened. The economy froze, people got laid off. And then at least in the US the economy came back really fast, faster than in other places.
00:42:26 And the labor wasn’t there, right? Baby boomers had checked out, they left the labor force, of course the borders were closed. And I remember, like, I was, I was doing a lot of flying back to LA at the time because I was hiding in Santa Barbara because the office was closed. And it’s like, like the counter at JetBlue in Boston was like, they just did not have enough people. People were coming back. Like, everyone was like, okay, we’re back. But the, the, they were, there wasn’t, the supply chains weren’t there. And so we had this very tight labor market that of course we would hear about all the time, you know, from the Jolts report, two job openings for every job seeker, that sort of thing. And that has been worked off over the last few years. I think that was the goal of the tightening policy or part of the goal. So when you look at the Jolts report, or you look at the, the U three jobless rate relative to Nru, the non-accelerated rate of employment, everything is in balance. Like it’s right at that zero line. So they supply, which
00:43:25 [Speaker Changed] Is, is that why we’ve kind of been hanging around four, three, yeah. Four, two. So in unemployment,
00:43:30 [Speaker Changed] So no one’s hiring, but not many people are looking for jobs and,
00:43:33 [Speaker Changed] And not a lot of people getting laid off.
00:43:35 [Speaker Changed] No. And so there’s balance, right? The job seekers versus the, the job providers. But you look at that chart over 50 years and you can see that there’s a pendulum swing of that business cycle. So we went from very tight to neutral and you know, like the inclination is to look at that and it’s like, well every other time that’s happened, the next phase is contraction recession. Yeah. And I think that’s what the bond market is saying. That’s I think what, what, where the fed’s coming from now that they did the 25, they’re looking at the, the jobs dated, they’re looking at the revision, right? The jobs report revision,
00:44:10 [Speaker Changed] Big downward revision, almost a
00:44:12 [Speaker Changed] Million jobs, nine, 11,000 jobs. And they’re like, okay, you know, we should, we should build in some, some cushion for that. And so I think that’s generally the vibe. But other than that, you know, we have a whole economics team that looks at the business cycle and we’re not really seeing a lot of red flags other than that yellow flag. If you,
00:44:31 [Speaker Changed] How, how closely does the market cycle track the business cycle? ’cause you know, I’ve heard, heard it said so many times the market is not the economy and vice versa. And the old joke is the stock market is forecast nine of the last four recessions. Yeah. How do you see the, that overlay?
00:44:48 [Speaker Changed] There is of course a connection, right? If you look at GDP growth and inventories, I mean, it’s less about that now than it was decades ago. The impact of monetary policy. But you know, the markets are not the economy. There is a reflection because if the economy grows, earnings are gonna grow and then, you know, the market’s gonna go up because price follows earnings. But there’s a sentiment equation in the stock market that of course you don’t have so much in the, in the economic cycle and, and you have the timing, right? So the market is always gonna anticipate future changes. So you, you
00:45:26 [Speaker Changed] Have a chart showing markets bottom eight months below profits.
00:45:30 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. So you can, that
00:45:31 [Speaker Changed] That’s a huge lead time. Yeah. Eight
00:45:33 [Speaker Changed] Months. So you can be a hundred percent correct about the economic cycle and be a hundred percent wrong about the market latest be because if it’s already been reflected, and if it’s already have has even over earned against that future signal, then you’re buying yesterday’s news. You news you missed it. But yeah, so the market generally at bottoms will bottom two, three quarters before earnings that happened during COVID. And I remembered like it was yesterday because during COVID, you know, the market felt 35% February and March then like late March it bottomed. And I
00:46:07 [Speaker Changed] Think March 25th, I don’t
00:46:09 [Speaker Changed] Remember that. And I think by June it was at new highs and people Right?
00:46:11 [Speaker Changed] 69% for the year. Yeah. From the lows. Yeah. Which
00:46:14 [Speaker Changed] Is amazing. And people, like the economists had a cover saying, this is divorce from reality and everyone. And so it’s my job a to have people not sell in the first place, right. To be, to be the long-term investor. You know, the way I I always describe it is you’re getting a really juicy 10, 11% return by investing in stocks, but the price of admission is you gotta endure some volatility, right? And if you can’t stand the price, then you don’t get the reward.
00:46:42 [Speaker Changed] How do you explain to clients and I I got a million calls, man, this market has become disconnected Yeah. From reality. What’s your explanation to them?
00:46:51 [Speaker Changed] So that, so that what, what happened? It happened after the financial crisis, right? So price bottoms, the market bets on recovery and it could be wrong, right? Price discovery doesn’t mean the market knows everything. Right? And that’s one thing where I sometimes disagree with technicians who say, market’s always right, say, well, the market’s not always right, but the market’s always right in discounting everything that’s knowable, right? So it’s right in that, but it doesn’t mean that that what it’s discounting can’t change, right? And we saw this during the, the tariff tantrum in April. The market was pricing in a left tail that never arrived, right? And now, and then it had to unpr it. So, but so the market looks ahead and the market bottomed in March of oh nine. Earnings didn’t bottom until the third or fourth quarter. Same thing during COVID march, bottomed in March of 2020, earnings recovered third or fourth quarter. And, and so you, you have, so you can’t look at the news and say, how can the market be here when the earnings or like, people are dying. So,
00:47:50 [Speaker Changed] So how did you explain this to clients? I’m curious.
00:47:52 [Speaker Changed] I explained it exactly that way that the price always leads. And you can’t look at it in sort of a linear way. You have to just, you, you have to know that at, at inflection points, the, the, the, the, the price action is gonna make no sense. And this is why people, you know, sell at bottoms and, and buy at tops because they are, they’re trying to understand the narrative. And that narrative is not the one that, that is ruling the, the roost at the time. One,
00:48:21 [Speaker Changed] One of the things that we found was useful was explaining to clients that their life experience isn’t market cap weighted. When you look at what’s driving the big indexes, it was back then it was the fang. Now we call it the magnificent seven. But we did a calculation and found out that if all the airlines, all the hotels, all the local retailers, like just a run of the worst businesses during the pandemic, if they just disappeared tomorrow, it was 6%. Yeah. Of the s and p 500 and you know, or Apple or Microsoft. It’s like, it’s amazing how, how our daily experience is so different from what markets are like.
00:49:01 [Speaker Changed] And we had that during Brexit in 2016. I mean, that was constantly the headlines. What about Brexit? Why is the, the US market ignoring it? Well, because it’s irrelevant because the UK is 3% of s and p revenues. That’s why, you know,
00:49:16 [Speaker Changed] So, so that raises really interesting question about the US versus the rest of the world in terms of economic activities. So the s and p 500 just gets just about half of its revenue from overseas for most of the past 15 years. The US side of consumer spending, business spending, government spending has been very supportive of the domestic side of the s and p 500. Kind of feels like that shifting a little bit. We’re seeing a little slowdown on consumer spending a little slowdown on economic activity here as Europe and Asia seem to be starting to finding their footing after bad 10 years. Can we just pass off the baton without the s and p stumbling? Is that, is that possible?
00:50:04 [Speaker Changed] It’s possible and it’s actually happening right now. And, and this is one of the areas that I’m most excited about right now, is that this US bull market has become a global bull market. You look at EM stocks, Chinese stocks, Europe, Japan. And it’s very exciting because, you know, for many years, right, the US exceptionalism train has been running since 20 14 15 and the rest of the world was always so tempting with its lower valuation. And I, I’ve had conversations, you know, with our asset allocation PMs for years saying look like, yeah, I can, I can buy EO or em at 14 times. They’re cheap. Yeah. Why? Like, and
00:50:44 [Speaker Changed] It’s cheap for a reason
00:50:45 [Speaker Changed] Though cheap for a reason. The market’s very efficient, but for the, but so the catalyst, so you need a catalyst to make the mean reversion in valuation to trigger that. And the catalyst is always gonna be related to earnings. Like if you look at the relative performance, US versus non-US over the past 10 years, it, it’s exactly the same as a relative earnings linee. Like it’s the same thing. So you need something to change in the, on the earning side. And that’s changing. So we have of course a very concentrated market in the US and, and that does pose risks, right? I mean if, if those seven stocks go down, guess what? The s and p is gonna go down. Even if 70% of the stocks in the s and p are going up, if you’re an indexer or you’re buying an ET an SBY, you’re not gonna feel those gains because those top seven stocks are, are taking the index down.
00:51:38 And so it was, so for the last year or so, it was a question of, okay, how do you diversify against concentration risk? Do you go down cap? Do you buy the Russell 2000? But now the answer is easier because now you have a catalyst, a fundamental catalyst that is causing the mean reversion to happen with between US and non-US stocks. And where that’s coming from is that, so I’m a big fan of the discounted cash flow model, the DCF, which looks at not so much earnings, but the payout of earnings. So if you have earnings growth at 10% and 70% of those earnings are being returned to shareholders as dividends or buybacks, the payout is that 70% and the payout ratio is 70%. And for the US it’s always been a very dominating scenario where the payout in the US is very strong because of all the share buybacks we have here. Where, where
00:52:32 [Speaker Changed] Are we today with that? Are we still seeing the same sort of share buybacks? ’cause it seems like we haven’t been hearing a lot of announcements, but that doesn’t mean it’s not happening. We
00:52:40 [Speaker Changed] Don’t hear a lot. But the buybacks are at record highs. There’s 300 billion over the last 12 months and the payout ratio is 75% for the s and p. Wow. But guess what? The payout for efa, which is non-US developed stocks, the payout ratio’s also 75%. It always used to be lower because they don’t do buybacks over there. Right. They do dividends, but now they’re doing more buybacks and the growth rate in the payout itself over the last five years is now higher in EFA than in the us. Wow. So you’re getting equal or superior or at least competitive fundamentals at, at a fraction of devaluation. And that that is a good, that’s a good deal. And so that’s, so finally that, that part is working where the pond that we’re fishing from is now broader. And for me, kind of it’s, it’s a barbell strategy. I don’t want to be short the max seven because they can get bigger. Right. And you don’t want to miss out on that. But rather than going down cap in the us go
00:53:43 [Speaker Changed] Overseas,
00:53:43 [Speaker Changed] Do a barbell of mag seven and non-US stocks, then you can play the dollar with dollar weakening story. You can get equally good fundamentals for a 15 PE instead of a 24 pe. And to me that’s, that’s, that’s a good, that’s a good thing right now. So,
00:53:59 [Speaker Changed] So the last two things I wanna talk to you about in terms of the current environment are inflation and sentiment. And I’m not sure how much of this is related. You know, when we see the Michigan sentiment data, it seems to be so awful and it just doesn’t feel like, is this really worse than the financial crisis worse than COVID, worse than the.com implosion in nine 11 or worse than the 87 crash? If, if you follow the sentiment data, it’s saying yes. Just doesn’t feel that way.
00:54:31 [Speaker Changed] No, it doesn’t. And I think the sentiment data, obviously they’re very bifurcated by political belief. Right. You know, and I, I,
00:54:40 [Speaker Changed] We’ve seen those charts are really useful.
00:54:41 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And I, I spent time on both coasts and I, you know, I was in at a dinner party in Montecito, California a few weeks ago, and people were like, how, how can everything look so good when we’re like, at the end of the world type of thing, right? And then I’ll be, you know, in some other place and it’ll be the, the total opposite. But I think a lot of the sentiment data are still driven by the inflation data. Like obviously the inflation rate has come down to 2.8%, but
00:55:10 [Speaker Changed] Everything remains more expensive. That,
00:55:12 [Speaker Changed] That, you know, that COV spike, you know, that has not been unwound. And one of, and that’s one of the things I worry about because not, not to make a comparison to the 1970s, which obviously was the great inflation,
00:55:24 [Speaker Changed] Structural and long term,
00:55:25 [Speaker Changed] But during the fifties and sixties, inflation was super low, 2%. Then you, to the second half of the sixties, it started to creep up and then it came back down. But in order to, for the average to be at 2%, if you go to 6%, you then need to go below two, right? For the average to be two. And we haven’t done that. We went from two to nine to 2.8, right? And we’re, we never went below two. And, and if we for some reason get another upswing, and we’re at three and four, like that five year number is now gonna be at four 5%. And I think that’s what’s driving a lot of this. It certainly did during COVID. And it’s things like food, right? So, you know, like the top
00:56:10 [Speaker Changed] Now beef prices are up, egg, egg prices have come back down. Yeah. But beef prices have run
00:56:14 [Speaker Changed] Away. So I, I think a lot of it has to do with that because, you know, people are employed, wages are, are competitive right now. And, you know, unemployment rate’s 4.3%, but I think it’s just that, that cost of living, it just kind of like grinds, right. You know, and it’s been grinding for five years now.
00:56:33 [Speaker Changed] So, so let’s talk about that 2% target. You know, in the 2010s, an era of concerns about deflation and monetary stimulus, 2% seemed like a reasonable number. Is that still a reasonable number now that, and that was an upside target. Yeah. Right. You were at 1% aiming for two. Now we’re at two and a half, three aiming back at two, maybe in an era of fiscal stimulus, two and a half, 3% makes more sense. I mean, I’m not a Yeah, Monet, but I, I don’t know why the whole world changes except for our inflation target.
00:57:08 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. There’s nothing magical about two. Like if you go back 150 years, again, the average inflation rate is like 3%, 2.8. If you look at a distribution of equity PEs and the inflation rate, the sweet spot is sort of one to four, right? So whether you’re at three or two, like for the stock market, doesn’t, doesn’t matter, doesn’t matter. Like 10, 10 to two like that, that
00:57:34 [Speaker Changed] Nine, nine matters
00:57:35 [Speaker Changed] That matters. And, and that distribution is interesting because obviously the higher the inflation rate goes, the lower the pe, which makes perfect sense. Sure. ’cause if inflation goes up, bond yields go up, then the safe asset is, is very competitive with the risky assets. So why take the risk
00:57:52 [Speaker Changed] Plus the cost of capital goes up? Yeah.
00:57:55 [Speaker Changed] If you go to the left hill deflation, there is really no correlation. Nobody likes deflation. So, so from that angle, two and a half is not a problem. Even three is not a problem. I think the Fed worries that if they were to ever admit that, you know, infl inflation expectations could get unanchored, but they went to the a IT thing, right? The average inflation targeting, and actually that actually prevented them from raising rates when they should have back in 2021 and two, they,
00:58:28 [Speaker Changed] They were late to the party to raise and they seemed like they were late to the party to cut as well.
00:58:32 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. So their, their policy was, we need to see the whites in the eyes of inflation before we raise rates. And, and by the time the whites of the eyes were visible, it was like too late. You know, inflation was at five, going to nine. But, so, you know, it, it’s a nuanced thing, but again, 3% is not gonna be the end of the world. It just means bonds have a term premium and stock market is still fine. Maybe the p is like 17 instead of 19. But like, you know, if earnings are doing the heavy lifting, it doesn’t matter. But again, it’s like, what, what will it take for the Fed to actually say that? Or will they ever say it? Or will we just have a post Powell fed that says, you know, instead of neutral being inflation plus a hundred neutral is inflation. And, and, and, and, you know, so there are three instead of, of four or something.
00:59:22 [Speaker Changed] So I see your charts everywhere. Not only are they all over social media, but you do regular chart packs. I I love your monthly chart pack. I’m gonna flip open my laptop and let’s look at some of your favorite charts, and I’ll make these available on YouTube and, and on the website. When, when this posts, let’s start with market cycles and, and what we see going back to around our birth date is just a series of long bull markets followed by shorter shallower bear markets. Tell us about this market cycle chart and what are the different shading means in, in blue and red. What, what’s the significance of that?
01:00:07 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so, so the shadings are, is the valuation, the five year cape ratio, when
01:00:13 [Speaker Changed] When it starts to get pricey, it turns red. It
01:00:15 [Speaker Changed] Turns red, yeah. And so what the top part of the chart shows are the market cycles. So the green are, you know, the bull markets, of course cyclical bull markets. The red are the bear markets. And you can see as we, as we talked about earlier, they’re really, it’s pretty rare for a 50% drawdown. There’s only been really a couple of them. And so what this shows is that the current bull market, as strange as it, or as unusual as it has felt for many people, actually is pretty garden variety, right? 88% gain over 35 months. So it’s pretty, pretty average. But then when you look at the bottom panel, it shows the relative, the percentage of stocks outperforming the index. And now you see something pretty unusual, something we’ve only seen a few times in history, and that is of course the, the concentration effect of the mag seven.
01:01:06 Then before that the fangs, and it is, the market is as concentrated as it was in the late nineties and the early to mid seventies, which was the original nifty 50. That’s right. Period. And so, you know, for, for an indexer, I guess it, it doesn’t matter for an active manage active investor, it does, but even for an indexer it does because the largest stocks are getting bid up whether they deserve it or not, of course they’re large because they deserve to be generally, but it shows you how narrow the market has been during this cycle. And so it, it’s, it’s just a way of describing kind of where we are. So you got the cyclical on the top and the bottom speaks more to the secular.
01:01:49 [Speaker Changed] Huh, really interesting. So let’s talk about debt dynamics, which shows the change in federal debt versus what.
01:01:58 [Speaker Changed] So what this chart shows, and I, it’s a very simple chart, but it’s, I think it speaks volumes is that, you know, during COVID, we kind of I think entered the fiscally dominant era where debt financing or deficit spending becomes a very major tool, which is definitely different from the financial crisis when we actually had austerity after the financial crisis with the tea party movement. Now we have the opposite. And in the initial years after that fiscal expansion started, the fed was actually doing a lot of the heavy lifting by putting those bonds, or not those bonds, but putting bonds on its balance sheet. So you could see the rise in debt is, is largely accommodated by an expanding balance sheet. Since that time, since 2022, the fed’s gone into quantitative tightening mode where it’s shrinking its balance sheet, but the debt just keeps going up. So the debt is now up about 14 trillion in the last five years, and only about two and a half of that is sort of been absorbed by the Fed. So I put two and two together and it’s like, okay, if that purple line at the top just keeps going up, who’s gonna buy this, right? Is it who’s gonna buy the debt? And will the Fed be forced back into playing a bigger role in kind of mopping up that supply? And that’s the fiscal dominance
01:03:22 [Speaker Changed] Theme. That’s a little bit of modern monetary theory is that the fed can just buy up all the debt and there’s no constraints whatsoever. SOMA stands for what
01:03:30 [Speaker Changed] System? Open market account.
01:03:32 [Speaker Changed] So that’s what the Fed has on its balance sheet. Yeah. So, so that, that went up since the financial crisis and it’s come down since 22.
01:03:39 [Speaker Changed] It’s, it’s the part of the fed’s balance sheet that is sort of the QE part, if you will.
01:03:43 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. So let, let’s talk a little bit about equity supply and demand. What are we looking at this chart back to 1986? Is this simply liquidity driven or what’s going on here?
01:03:55 [Speaker Changed] So I think this is, and it, it, not a lot of people talk about this, but I think this is one of the fundamental drivers of the current secular bull market era. And so you can see on the chart, I started the clock at the bottom in oh nine, which again, I, I believe is the start of the secular bull market. And I look at just the supply and demand of equities just from within the corporate America structure. So not investor flows, but how much, where are there in IPOs and secondary issues? And it’s a couple of trillion, how much was share buybacks and how much was m and a and share buybacks and m and a have something in common in that it’s corporates buying shares of other corporates and those shares get retired, right? So that, that’s the demand for shares. And what you see is the, if you look at the supply demand ratio, like it’s very unbalanced. Like it’s, the demand far exceeds the supply. And to me, this has been one of the important drivers for driving returns in the secular bull market. And there’s no signs that this is, this is letting up. And so when, when, when we think about what inning is the secular bull market in, when is it gonna end? And why? This is one of the things I look at. It’s just, you know, when when you’re retiring far more shares than you are issuing, it’s like, duh, you know, markets are gonna go up. All else being equal.
01:05:19 [Speaker Changed] What what’s so surprising about this is how relatively insignificant the retail flows are. Yes. They’re, it’s, it’s just the opposite of how so many people describe it. Yeah. Coming up we continue our conversation with your Timor director of global macro at Fidelity discussing various asset classes, equities, bonds, commodities alternatives. You are listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. I am Barry Ritholtz. You are listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. My extra special guest this week is Ian Timmer. He is the director of Global Macro at Fidelity Investments, the giant firm helping to manage over $16 trillion in client assets. Let’s talk about US fundamentals versus EFA fundamentals. So this looks at various market data, buybacks, dividends, et cetera. Tell us what this chart is showing us. Yeah,
01:06:29 [Speaker Changed] So this, we were talking about earlier about there finally being a catalyst for non-US stocks to compete with the u with the MAG seven driven US stock market. And so on the left, I show the earnings line for the s and p, the payout so that the share of earnings re being returned, quote unquote, to shareholders shareholder
01:06:50 [Speaker Changed] Yields
01:06:50 [Speaker Changed] As as dividends and buybacks. And then at the bottom you see the, the payout ratio again, either as dividends in the yellow buybacks in the purple. And you can see the, the payout has risen very nicely, almost a double since, oh, since five years ago. Payout ratio is about 75%. So very bullish fundamentals like you, you know, those fundamentals deserve a high, a high pe right? Because not only is, are the earnings growing, but they’re being returned to shareholders, which of course is worth more than if you’re not getting them back. It’s just the present value of future cash flows. But what’s changed just in the last few years is that for efa, again, which is the MSEI, non-US developed index, you see an even better growth rate in the payout and you see an
01:07:39 [Speaker Changed] More than double.
01:07:40 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And you see an equally robust payout ratio, again of about 75%. So the rest of the world is really competitive now, despite the fact that this is such a max seven heavy market. And so this is, you know, just a very exciting time because you can actually, you don’t have to make that make or break binary decision. Like you’re either in these big stocks point not, or, or you’re left behind. There are other places to get those returns down.
01:08:07 [Speaker Changed] What what’s so fascinating about this chart is how inverted the ratio of buybacks to dividends is. Yes, very much in the us 45% of shareholder yield is buybacks, 30% are dividends that flips. In Europe, it’s 47% are dividends. Only 27% are buybacks, or I should say efa, not just Europe. Although a lot of it seems to be concentrated in Europe. Yes. How much of that is just driven by tax policy and regulations?
01:08:36 [Speaker Changed] It, I think it’s largely culture. It’s just, you know, and Europe is more of a value market, right? So it’s really like the banks are, are really running the show right now. And so the US it’s more the growthy stocks, so they don’t want to, so, you know, dividends are kind of like a sacred contract, if you will. Like, it takes a lot for dividends to be cut. So I think Europe and Japan has just generally been more of a, of a value driven and the culture has been more, okay, we’re gonna earn so much and you’re gonna get that back as dividends. But especially the Japanese and also the Europeans are, are getting much more with the, the shareholder culture now in terms of unlocking value and, and re and returning those as, as buybacks. So it’s, they’re they’re getting, they’re, they’re starting to play the game.
01:09:23 [Speaker Changed] La last few questions before we get to our favorite questions. You, you have a section in the chart book about the post 60 40 world. I’ve heard people say the old 60 40 is now 50 30 20 or fifty thirty ten five five. Tell us what you think of as the post 60 40 world.
01:09:48 [Speaker Changed] So I, I look at it, i, I call it the sixty twenty twenty. So the 60 40 paradigm worked like a charm, right from the late nineties until the early 2020s and, you know, 60% s and p, 40% Bloomberg ag, so the investment grade bond index, and you got a 9% CAGR against the 9% vol. And like, what’s not to like about that, right? During that time, inflation was like two and a half. So you got a very attractive real return with really moderate volatility. But the whole premise of that paradigm was that the 40 was insurance against the 60. So the 60 of course is always the anchor. That’s where the compounding is. And the 40 would be your port in the storm. I think that’s now changed. So 2022 obviously was a return to the old fed model days where rising yields take, you know, take, take the, the mojo out of the stock market to put it mildly.
01:10:52 The good news is that bonds of course now are a viable asset. They, they generate a positive real yield, but their correlation is now positive against equities instead of negative. So when I think about the post 60 40 world, I’m less worried about the 60, like we can add more international into 60 and, and like we were just discussing, but what do we do about the 40, if the 40 can be the cause of problems rather than the solution to problems, and especially if we end up with a higher term premium, then bonds are not gonna be as, as safe as they used to be. So then I get into kind of, okay, I’m gonna take some share from the bonds. It doesn’t have to be 20. Like again, this is not investment advice, but back at the envelope stuff and you know, maybe some cash strategies are more competitive if we’re not gonna go back to the zero interest rate days, which I don’t think we are. Gold are the proven anti bond over history, right? They don’t produce a cash flow,
01:11:51 [Speaker Changed] 3,700 bucks as we speak,
01:11:53 [Speaker Changed] But when bonds do poorly, gold really shines, no pun intended. And then you gotta throw Bitcoin in there as kind of the, the wannabe exponential gold and then other strategies like alternatives, right? Managed futures, equity, long, short, private credit, you know, all of those kind of alpha rather than beta strategies.
01:12:15 [Speaker Changed] You have, you have tips in there as well.
01:12:17 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, tips, high yield, you know, markets or asset classes that are not negatively correlated, but they’re not positively correlated as well. So when you look at kind of the sharp ratios versus the correlation, not just to the 60, but especially to the 40, right? Because I wanna hedge more against the 40 than the 60.
01:12:38 [Speaker Changed] I was gonna say, this doesn’t look like a yield chase. This looks like a diversifier. Is that the thinking here? Yeah,
01:12:43 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And actually if you go down one chart, I think, yeah, right there. Oh, look at that. So I want high sharp ratios or high and low correlations, high sortino ratios and, and, and assets that are uncorrelated. And you get into, you get into the BComm commodities, you get into gold, you get, Bitcoin is not quite uncorrelated, but all the alt strategies are uncorrelated. And so to me that is sort of the next 60 40.
01:13:10 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. Really, really fascinating. Last question before we get to our favorites. You look at so many charts each week you identify trends before a lot of people do. What are investors not talking about, but perhaps should be? What topics, assets, geographies, data points. What do you think is getting overlooked? But it’s really worth investors time to pay attention to
01:13:34 [Speaker Changed] One asset class. And we just talked about it. That I think generally is seen as a, as a side show the way Bitcoin used to be. It’s no longer a sideshow for sure is actually gold because for
01:13:48 [Speaker Changed] Even at 3,700 bucks, it’s, well, are people still thinking of it as a sideshow?
01:13:52 [Speaker Changed] I I think institutions do, right? So regular retail investors as, as I call ’em, you know, you can buy GLD or some other gold ETF and like, you know, I own it in my portfolio. And so there, I think there, it’s part of the conversation, but when you think about like large endowments, institutional investors, even mutual funds, like you need a special wrapper in your mutual fund to own physical gold. Like you need to go to the SEC and get approval. And so I, you know, gold has been sort of dormant for so long until recently that is like, yeah, I don’t really want to go through this trouble to buy something that doesn’t have a cashflow, can’t be valued, right? Requires special regulatory approvals and then all of a sudden it starts to run like it is now.
01:14:39 [Speaker Changed] Everybody wants
01:14:40 [Speaker Changed] In. And, and so, so I think that’s the story. So in, in, I ironically, because Bitcoin has, has obviously come well after gold as a kind of a store value, hard money asset in a way. Gold is kind of like where Bitcoin was 10 years ago or five years ago, where okay, bitcoin’s interesting, but I don’t understand it. I don’t feel like spending a hundred hours on this. It’s a bubble, it’s a scam, it’s a pet rock. And, and gold is like, if it keeps going the way it is, and I suspect it will, like the endowments are like, okay, like people are asking me about this. I need to like really like figure out how do we not how do we buy it? You can buy it of course, but it’s, it’s always been a, a dismissed asset, let me put it that way. Among,
01:15:27 [Speaker Changed] I mean that’s what I grew up with. Yeah. It was kind of mocked by the equity people. Yeah. Depends on the length of the chart you look at. You could show a trailing multi-decade period where gold has outperformed the s and p. Yeah, absolutely. So, so if you look at gold as in a secular bull market, I’m not asking for a forecast, but what’s within the range of possible numbers Gold could run to from 3,700 up from the low two thousands and early, what, what are we peaking? Like 2014 and then 2019, something like that. Yeah.
01:16:00 [Speaker Changed] And it was like 260 back in the,
01:16:03 [Speaker Changed] Oh God, I remember in the nineties, financial.
01:16:05 [Speaker Changed] Sure. Yeah. So
01:16:05 [Speaker Changed] When GLD first came out, I wanna say gold was about 4 30, 4 40. I remember talking about it on TV and getting laughed at by
01:16:12 [Speaker Changed] Anchors. Yeah. So I, I once saw a chart that actually Paul Tudor Jones created as really speaking of Paul, where he compared the, the above ground value of gold or the value of above ground gold and compared it to the, the value of M two and, and the
01:16:32 [Speaker Changed] Chart, they kind of track each other.
01:16:33 [Speaker Changed] The chart concluded that when the money supply grows too fast, gold takes market share. So hard money takes market share from soft money from fiat money. And at certain extremes, like in the seventies and other periods of thirties, gold, the value of gold will go all the way up or beyond the value of M two. And so right now M two is about 23 trillion gold plus Bitcoin is, is also about 23 trillion. So in that sense, it’s come a long way to, to take that market share. And now it’s a question of does M two either globally or in the US continue to grow at an above average pace? So the average pace is about 6% nominal, about two, two, 3% real. So I, I do think a lot of the gains are in already, but it will, it will naturally overshoot as these cycles always do. So, so that’s kind of how I would, how I would measure it. So if the money supply goes to 30 trillion gold and Bitcoin could be 35 trillion and, and obviously gold to is, is a large part of that, Bitcoin’s about 2 trillion. And then you convert that to, to a price. But that’s kind of how I think about the valuation side. Hmm.
01:17:49 [Speaker Changed] Really fascinating. Tell us about your mentors who helped shape your career.
01:17:56 [Speaker Changed] Definitely Ned Johnson, because when I came in to Fidelity in 95, I’d been in, you know, in New York for 10 years, didn’t really have mentors. And so he, you know, fidelity has a very strong corporate culture, let’s put it that way. And especially around, you know, the way we approach long-term investments. We’re obviously a long-term investor, but so he, he was like the last person I spoke to before I got hired. And then in those formative years I worked in the chart room and I would spend hours per week with, with Ned. Like he would just come down really? And, and, and we hours per week and we would just pour over charts. Like we have these huge charts on the wall floor to ceiling, you know, like 40 foot wide, like a, a daily chart of the, of whatever the Dao SP
01:18:50 [Speaker Changed] Manually by hand done
01:18:51 [Speaker Changed] By it, it would be computer generated. But then, because we don’t wanna print a whole new 40 foot sheet every week. So you would just, you fill it in by hand and, and you know, just the the oral tradition, the oral history. So he was looking at the chart and then he would say, okay, well, like, and he would go from le right to left and say, okay, you know, then, and we’d end up like, in 1968 and he’s telling me about the glamor stalks and this and that, and I’m like, well this is like gold, right? Like you don’t, you know, literally. And so he would have this encyclopedic memory, but also just the way the information was displayed, semi log skills, the chart room has like museum quality lighting, how you display, how you visualize, you know, data. And so that he instilled that culture, you know, we, we call it kaizen, kind of just gradually improving and having, you know, compounding isn’t just for investing, right? That’s right. It’s just in our day-to-day stuff, you do something consistently, right? It’s gonna make an impact. And when I look back at my 40 years and I’m not going anywhere, but like to me that, that kaizen has, has really played a role in my relationships, in my work. And, and I think a lot of that just came from him.
01:20:10 [Speaker Changed] So, huh, really, really interesting. Let’s talk about books. What are some of your favorites? What are you reading now?
01:20:16 [Speaker Changed] So I, I hate to admit it, but I don’t read a lot of finance books because I’m very interested in having balanced between,
01:20:24 [Speaker Changed] Oh, I don’t want finance books
01:20:26 [Speaker Changed] Between right and left brain.
01:20:27 [Speaker Changed] We’ve all read reminiscence of a stock operator. I’m cu more curious as to what else you’re reading.
01:20:32 [Speaker Changed] Well, I will say that during COVID I read this huge tomb called The History of the Federal Reserve by Alan Meltzer. Oh, sure. Because, you know, I’ve looked at so many charts. You’ve read the reports of like, you know, financial oppression.
01:20:48 [Speaker Changed] It’s like a thousand pages isn’t Ital, it’s a door stop. 01:20:50 [Speaker Changed] But I went like that book, it was like this blow by blow using the Fed Minutes and all these, you know, correspondence to see how the fed handled the fi the financial repression of the forties. And so that was fascinating, although most people would say, well that sounds really boring, a little dry. But, but as, as a, as a consumer of the data just to hit to see, okay, you know, like the wherever was at the Fed would go to the Treasury and the, they were playing games like the treasury would issue bonds below market and then the auction would fill, and then knowing that the Fed would have to mop up the supply, like all of that stuff was just really Oh, really, really fascinating. And you know, and we see the interference in poli with politics and monies, monetary policy today, but it’s nothing new like in the sixties. Both Nixon and Kennedy were equally guilty of, seems
01:21:41 [Speaker Changed] A little more overt. It’s more in public today, more overt. It used to be sort of cloak room sort of stuff. Yeah.
01:21:47 [Speaker Changed] So, so that was one, but the, i, the most interesting recent book I’ve read was, it’s called Rock Me on the Water, and it’s a book about music, TV and movies during the early seventies and how LA was like the epicenter of American culture. So you had like the Laurel Canyon folks, the modern musicians, Tony
01:22:11 [Speaker Changed] Mitchell, David Crosby,
01:22:13 [Speaker Changed] And he had these groundbreaking TV shows, right? Because we were coming out of the straight jacket of the sixties, conformist, like no one dared to make a, a show that that like challenged the, the status quo. And then you had like Mash and you know, Mary Tyler Moore, all the family, all the family, and then the movies like Taxi Driver and, and as a, you know, as a, I I’m, I think I’m kind of Gen X, but on the border of Gen X and baby boom,
01:22:37 [Speaker Changed] Right? I’m in the same like a foot in each camp. Yeah,
01:22:40 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And so growing up, you know, formative years in the seventies in Aruba, but consuming American pop culture, right? We would sit down every night watching like, you know, wide World of Sports and Mary Tyler Moore and, and all those shows
01:22:53 [Speaker Changed] Rock Me on the Water,
01:22:55 [Speaker Changed] Rock Me on the Water. Oh, that’s, and it, it’s just like, so it, it’s fascinating to read about the things that we lived through as kids, as teenagers, but then like yeah. You know, that was
01:23:06 [Speaker Changed] So amazing. Let’s talk about streaming. What are you watching or listening to right now?
01:23:12 [Speaker Changed] We are binge watching the Bear. So I’m a, I’m an avid cook, you know, like I said, I run a food camp at Burning Man and that’s, that’s, and we, we tend to be late to shows and then we, we just watch like four plow
01:23:26 [Speaker Changed] Through them four seasons. Yeah. The bear is great. Yeah. So we’re, and if you’re a cook all worked in restaurants. Yeah, yeah. It just rings so true. Yeah. Yeah. I gotta ask you a a a crazy question. You’re a cook. What pots do you like? What knives do you like?
01:23:41 [Speaker Changed] I use the all clad. I have, I, I have two places. I have a, a gas stove in Santa Barbara and an induction stove in Boston. You
01:23:51 [Speaker Changed] Know, I came this close to putting an induction stove in my primary residence, but we had just gotten gas and so of course we ran with gas. Yeah. I,
01:24:00 [Speaker Changed] I I will run with gas anytime. Induction is good. It’s very precise. Yes. But it’s safe. I, I like the, the organic kind of tactile dimension of gas, but so all clad and the, the German knives, what’s it called? Gu, I forget. And my go-to knife is a 10 inch chef’s knife. Not the really high one, but the medium one. So the medium one is, is thick enough to like smash on garlic, but not so thick that you don’t feel connected. You don’t have the, the, the road feel of the knife on the cutting board. So,
01:24:40 [Speaker Changed] So I’m jonesing for this shun knife I keep seeing and they’re just exorbitant. Yeah. And we gave someone a gift of the Stanley Tucci healthy, non-sick. I supposedly the old non-stick is not good. Yeah. And she loves it. She’s been, so we debating going out and getting a set for a, like, it’s rare you give someone a gift and they’re like, oh my god, this is amazing. Stanley
01:25:06 [Speaker Changed] Tucci is one of my heroes.
01:25:07 [Speaker Changed] Oh really? Yeah. Have you watched this show in Italy? Yeah, I had a stop. ’cause it just makes me want to eat even after dinner. You want to go, you want to go eat that?
01:25:16 [Speaker Changed] That, that’s my, my guilty pleasure on TikTok is little food clips and I don’t even have to have the sound on. It’s just, you know, because I kind of know what works with recipes, so I don’t need a recipe, but I just need someone to visualize an approach. And so a lot of the things I cook today are from TikTok.
01:25:36 [Speaker Changed] Oh, no kidding. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that’s amazing. Alright, our final two questions. What sort of advice would you give a recent college grad interested in a career in technical analysis? Fixed income, or just investing generally?
01:25:52 [Speaker Changed] Be open-minded. Be humble. You know, the, the, the true heroes of mine in our business, including Ned Johnson. You know, he, he’s no longer with us, of course. Was that just humility, right? I’ll talk to Will Danoff, who runs 300 billion I love Will. He’s the humblest guy, right? You’ll ever, he’s amazing. You’ll ever meet and there’s no room for, for big egos, like, no matter how important you are, like I, I have no time for that. Right? So stay humble. Don’t figure out, don’t think you’ve, or you’ve, you’ve figured it all out when at, at the age of 25, you know, be learner and be ready to reinvent yourself. I’ve had to do it a number of times at Fidelity, either as planned or as not planned. And you just gotta roll with the punches. And like I said, the first job I had, I, I was like the last job I was interested in, but I took it because it was the only job, you know?
01:26:42 [Speaker Changed] And our final question, what do you know about the world of investing today? You wish you knew 40 years ago or so when you were first getting started
01:26:52 [Speaker Changed] That markets go through cycles and it always comes back. Not always quickly, but you know, every time the market goes down 20 plus percent it’s like the end of the world. And it’s like totally different from every other time. And this is like such a crisis. But then, you know, I’ve now been through like 12 bear markets in my career and it’s like, yeah, whatever. Like nothing shocks me anymore. Of course I’m, I’m maybe in a better place ’cause I’ve, I’ve earned my, my wealth. I’m not still building it, but Right. But it’s just, you know, take, take, take a step back, look at the bigger picture, make sure your portfolio is where it should be in terms of risk and goals. And don’t be your own worst enemy by selling at the bottom. You know, call, call someone like have ’em talk you off the ledge first. You know.
01:27:40 [Speaker Changed] Thank you Yian for being so generous with your time. We have been speaking with Yian Timmer, director of Global Macro at Fidelity Investments. If you enjoy this conversation, well check out any of the 563 we’ve done over the past 11 and a half years.

45,2025-10-14,"Ah, yes, who doesn't love the time-honored genre of, ""The slow and steady dissolution of a marriage between people who probably shouldn't have been together in the first place?"" Okay, that might be a slight oversimplification of what used to be a reliable source of box office profits in years past, primarily carried by adult-minded dramadies in the same vein as ""The Roses."" Another adaptation of the famous Warren Adler novel ""The War of the Roses"" (following Danny DeVito's 1989 film), this fresh and modernized retelling from director Jay Roach was one of the year's quieter releases, though /Film's Ethan Anderton praised it as ""a devilishly hilarious dark comedy"" in his review. Two classically-trained theater actors at the top of their game going at each other with witty barbs and casual cruelty for our entertainment? What's not to love!
After earning a decent $50 million worldwide in theaters, ""The Roses"" is now taking its unconventional love story to viewers at home. Starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Olivia Colman as Theo and Ivy Rose, the story follows the ""happy"" couple and their kids as they get a heaping dose of the trials and tribulations that life has a habit of throwing at the unsuspecting. Anyone even casually familiar with the source material (or DeVito's adaptation) knows where things are headed next.
Searchlight Pictures has announced the film will be made available to purchase or rent digitally starting October 21, 2025, through an online retailer nearest you — including Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV, and Fandango at Home. But for those looking forward to a more in-depth collection, ""The Roses"" will finally make its debut on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray, and DVD on November 25, 2025, just in time for the Thanksgiving holiday, naturally. You can check out a new TV spot below.

Leave it to comedy director Jay Roach and acclaimed screenwriter Tony McNamara (""The Favourite,"" ""The Great,"" ""Poor Things"") to find a way to bring back one of fiction's most infamous collapsing marriages to life in a whole new way. ""The Roses"" boasts a collection of A-list talent in addition to Benedict Cumberbatch and Olivia Colman, including the likes of Kate McKinnon, Andy Samberg, (now former) ""Doctor Who"" star Ncuti Gatwa, Sunita Mani, the great Allison Janney, and many more. The end result may be somewhat different from the 1989 ""The War of the Roses,"" as Roach explained to /Film here, but fans will find plenty to appreciate in this new adaptation.
Whether you caught the film in theaters the first time around or are finally taking the plunge for yourself, ""The Roses"" will soon be available to watch at home ... along with a bevy of bonus features on both digital and physical copies to keep viewers occupied. These include:
Gag Reel
Featurettes:
A House To Fight For – A behind-the-front-door look at the epicenter of both beauty and acrimony. See the construction of the Roses' home, hear from the designer and the filmmakers on their vision, and discover the actors' wish to take everything from the house home with them.
The Roses: An Inside Look – Hear from the cast and filmmakers about making The Roses. Learn about the actors' connection and chemistry, and join the grounded, satirical, British, wry wit that only Olivia Colman and Benedict Cumberbatch can pull off.
Comedy Gold – This cast is stacked with comedy talent bringing Tony McNamara's witty dialogue to life with Jay Roach directing. Even Olivia Colman had to ask about this special cast, ""How the F did we get them?"""

Every startup lives with the same tension: a large incumbent can copy or crush it at any time.
For Harvey, an artificial intelligence startup that builds tools for law firms and enterprises, the model-maker that powers its tech also has the power to destroy it.
From Harvey's Manhattan office on Friday afternoon, cofounders Winston Weinberg and Gabe Pereyra put it bluntly. Harvey's toughest competitor isn't another niche startup; it's OpenAI.
""Our largest competitor is by far, indirectly, OpenAI,"" Weinberg said. ""I mean that in the sense of just — you need to make sure that your product gives so much more value than whatever the general products they're releasing are.""
Harvey's biggest rival is also a backer. The OpenAI Startup Fund wrote one of the first checks into Harvey and has continued to increase its stake with additional funding. To date, Harvey has raised over $800 million.
The startup, last valued at $5 billion, has counted on being domain-specific to attract large law firms. Harvey just signed its 50th client in the Am Law 100, a group of the largest US law firms by revenue, the company said.
The founders say they tell their team that customers will measure Harvey against whatever general-purpose tool OpenAI ships next, even if it doesn't specifically target legal work.
Surveys by the American Bar Association and the Thomson Reuters Institute indicate that lawyers are already using ChatGPT to draft memos, conduct legal research, and predict case outcomes — with mixed results. Judges are increasingly catching fake citations in court documents.
Across the software market, concerns are growing that the foundation model companies will launch specialized tools for narrow domains or use cases. Recently, OpenAI blogged about a set of internal tools — a contract review tool among them — that it uses to run its own business.
OpenAI may be famous for its chatbot, but since 2022, it has emerged as a default partner for startups to build frontier tech for their industries without training their own large language models. Harvey builds on its models and works closely with the company to deploy custom-trained models and features for legal professionals.
OpenAI hasn't publicly released the tools it showed off. Still, the blog posts fanned fears that it could one day compete with the startups it now enables.
Harvey's founders say the threat persists whether OpenAI targets lawyers or not.
Pereyra argued that big cloud and model providers will continue to perfect general-purpose AI platforms — helpful developments, but not a focus for Harvey. ""They're solving a very different problem,"" he said.
Harvey wants to build the operating system for law firms: software that knows what a matter is, routes tasks to the right people, pulls the right documents at the right moment, and can swap in different models under strict controls.
In that view, the founders say the value isn't in packaging ever-better models; it's in the application layer that makes those models useful inside a law firm.
""If you think about them as the main competitor,"" Weinberg said, ""all that does is make you create better tools for your vertical faster.""

Only in the US are data centers the main driver of surging global power demand, a new report from consulting firm McKinsey & Company says.
Industrial development is on pace to double global electricity demand by 2050, according to McKinsey & Company's Global Energy Perspective 2025 report. The race to build artificial intelligence data centers is a key driver of that demand in Western Europe, China, and North America.
""After analyzing a detailed pipeline of data center projects, we predict an average global growth rate of 17% per year in data-center-related power demand between 2022 and 2030,"" the report states.
In the US, that average growth rate jumps to 25%.
By 2030, data centers could account for more than 14% of the US's total power demand, even with gains in energy efficiency from new chips and sustainable data center infrastructure. That rate is more than triple the amount of power US data centers used in 2023.
Big Tech companies are building massive new data center campuses across the country and are continuing to announce new projects. Utilities are projecting 60 gigawatts — enough electricity to power six cities — of new power demand will come from data centers alone through the end of the decade.
From Virginia to Louisiana and Arizona, the major public utilities are seeking regulatory approval to build new power plants and transmission lines. These projects often run into the billions of dollars, and have raised questions over how much of the costs should be passed on to residential and small business ratepayers.
In August, regulators approved Entergy Louisiana's plans to recover $5 billion in construction costs for three new natural gas plants needed to serve a Meta data center under construction in the state.
Some companies are taking matters into their own hands. The Stargate campus in Abilene, Texas — home to an Oracle data center that will house a massive cluster of OpenAI's servers — is being powered by an on-site natural gas plant.
The McKinsey report notes that amid rising electricity demand, fossil fuels are likely to remain a large part of the energy mix through 2050.
Nascent low-carbon energy technologies such as carbon capture and hydrogen power are taking longer than expected to mature, and are likely to remain a small part of the market over the next few decades, the report states.

51,2025-10-14,"HCLTech's September quarter revenue grew better than anticipated, marking a return to sequential growth. Profit growth met expectations. The company is focusing on AI services and intellectual property. New deal wins showed strong momentum, particularly in smaller contracts. Headcount increased, and attrition softened. Salary increments in October may impact future margins.
Overall, like TCS, HCLTech has continued to show traction in new deal wins and client engagements. The growth in next few quarters will depend upon the extent of project ramp ups.

The prevailing narrative of a crippled China buckling under tariffs is a dangerous fantasy, and savvy investors should ignore it. The current trade war is repeating the script of Trump’s first term: less about economic victory and more about the domestic political value of perpetual brinkmanship. Here is the critical pivot: China is ready for it.
The Data Debunks the Dependency Narrative
Contrary to the belief that China’s export engine is tethered to the U.S. consumer, recent data shatters the dependence myth. Chinese exports to the U.S. in September plummeted 27% year-over-year. Yet, China’s total exports simultaneously rose 8.3%. And imports hit a 17-month high. This is not a nation collapsing, it is a global power executing a pivot.
Beijing is focused globally. Forget the old factory floor categories, the new drivers are Chinese autos, semiconductors, and ships, sectors that thrive outside the American supply chain. Robust demand from Europe, ASEAN, and Latin America is now providing a crucial, durable cushion, deflating the leverage Washington once hoped to wield.
The Political Theater is the Real Game, and the Scorecard is the Stock Market
Investors must recognize that President Trump’s latest tariff threats are primarily a domestic political instrument, not a genuine play for economic resolution. The goal is to sustain the image of a successful negotiation and leverage. A strong stock market is critical in this scheme, serving as proof that the strategy is working, regardless of the fine print of global trade.
A “final deal” is the worst-case outcome for the political cycle, as it removes the tension and the promise of a future, even better deal. High-level negotiations are mere sideshows for optics. An imminent, promised-but-never-delivered deal allows the President to take credit for the market’s resilience without the risk of a messy, market-unsettling conclusion. 
The Investor’s Advantage: Stability in Uncertainty
Bearish investors expecting a dramatic Chinese capitulation or a crippling economic blow dealt to the U.S. are likely to be disappointed. Yes, market volatility will accompany tariff headlines, but the economic fallout is blunted by China’s diversified global links and the resilience of American corporate leaders. They can manage the President’s trade war, as they did in his first term. 
The critical takeaway for your portfolio is this: Do not bet against the political desire for a rising stock market. Endless negotiations are not negative for investors because they allow the primary driver, political optics, to remain focused on growth. This state of constant, but predictable, tension can coexist perfectly with healthy corporate earnings, sustained global demand, and relative stability. Promises of a great deal to come, the endless carrot, are ultimately more valuable and less disruptive to markets than a complicated, uncertain trade agreement.
The Bottom Line: Don’t trade on the hope, or fear, of the next “final” deal headline. China’s hand is stronger than it appears, and the trade war’s drama will not dictate broad market returns. Embrace the stability of the standoff: for investors, the process has become the product. If you are on the other side of the trade, betting on collapse when the policy goal is growth, you are going to lose.
 
Trade the trend, not the theater. Share this with someone still waiting for a “final deal.”"

The technology industry is seeing a growing divergence between the haves and the have-nots, with the haves increasingly concentrated among a handful of multi-trillion dollar companies with strong positions in AI and cloud infrastructure. That is raising the idea that a huge wave of dealmaking is coming. 
In the have-not category, companies will need to find suitors before the musical chairs end. All options are now on the table for enterprise AI services company C3 AI, with its stock price recently hitting new lows following the exit of tech legend and former CEO Tom Siebel and bad financial results. 
C3 AI, founded by Siebel, was arguably one of the first high-profile AI services companies in the market. Yet, since its IPO in 2020, the company’s performance has been miserable and surpassed by many competitors such as Palantir in the AI boom. C3 even has the best ticker symbol in the industry—AI.
What’s that ticker symbol worth? With a modest market capitalization of only about $2.5 billion and about $400 million in annual sales, C3 could make a nice snack for a trillionaire. C3’s chief attraction is enterprise and government contracts in AI services. It could be attractive to one of its partners—which include Amazon, Google, and Microsoft—or perhaps an AI-focused company such as NVIDIA or OpenAI, as they look to diversify into additional enterprise services. 
Dan Ives, in influential technology analyst at Wedbush, believes C3 is an obvious M&A target. He recently put the company on his list of targets and wrote about a favorable environment for a “floodgate” of tech deals that he expects. 
“With the regulatory landscape becoming more lenient to acquisitions with the new administrations stepping in and no longer representing steep hurdles, we believe that the tech M&A floodgates are ready to be opened as more opportunities arise to add accretive assets with an easier path forward,” Ives wrote in a recent investor note. 
Scott Galloway, a professor at NYU Stern as well as a tech founder and podcaster, also spoke of the potential for an explosion of tech M&A on his Prof G Markets podcast. He pointed out that growing divergence among tech companies and explosive share gains in NVIDIA and OpenAI providing grist for the M&A mill. 
You might be asking, how did C3.ai get here? As hard as it is to imagine, in the middle of the AI boom, the company’s shares have been in freefall after it preannounced in August that fiscal first-quarter results would miss guidance by 30%. But just the latest blip an ongoing trend of years of poor execution. 
When AI was just a glimmer in most investors’ eyes, C3 AI went public in an IPO on December 9, 2020, at a price of $42 per share. Expectations were high. The IPO raised approximately $650 million and attracted significant investor interest, with shares opening much higher and reaching a record high shortly after trading began. 
The riches were short-lived. A massive decline started in early 2021, which accelerated during the tech correction of 2022. With slow growth, accumulated losses, and changes in the macroeconomic environment, C3 stock was plumbing all-time lows near $10 in 2023. Then the stock rebounded on the hopes that the company could take advantage of big AI trends in 2023, rising as high as $50. But this year, those hopes have been dashed due to poor execution and the departure of Siebel. Today shares are trading at around $18, 60% below the IPO price five years ago.
The good news? New C3 CEO Stephen Ehikian has plenty of resources as well as plenty of time. The company has approximately $700 million in cash reserves against recent annual negative cash flow of $80 billion. It has a nice cushion to drive toward break-even—or find a buyer. 
Its biggest asset might be PANDA, a predictive maintenance platform contract with the U.S. Air Force. PANDA delivers near-real-time insights by monitoring components on hundreds of aircraft, including the B1-B Lancer, C-5 Galaxy, KC-135 Stratotanker, C-17 Globemaster III, and C-130J Super Hercules. That current Air Force contract is pegged at $450 million over several years.
C3 is also ramping up its partnerships with cloud providers. It recently pivoted its sales strategy, placing the emphasis on partnership with large tech firms. The company’s deals with major tech companies like Microsoft, AWS, and Google Cloud accounted for more than 70% of sales in a recent quarter, showing a 68% year-over-year rise in partner-driven deals during fiscal 2025. The partnership with Microsoft is especially strong, with C3 applications integrated into Azure's sales catalog and multiple joint agreements closed targeting manufacturing and chemical sectors. 
Efforts also include partnerships with consulting firms like PwC and McKinsey’s QuantumBlack. 
With its small market capitalization and solid enterprise and military contracts, C3 might make sense for companies looking to diversify after a rapid rise in stock prices. 
For example, Galloway has pointed out that NVIDIA and OpenAI have been injected with huge liquidity with the massive rise in their valuations. With a market capitalization of only $2.6 billion, C3 could represent a low-risk entry into customer relationships and government services contracts.
Why would NVIDIA be interested? The recent Futuriom Enterprise AI Index data show that NVIDIA is gaining traction in enterprise AI services projects, which could prove synergistic with C3 customer base. Among more than 150 enterprise case studies we tracked, NVIDIA AI Enterprise services was in the top six platforms used in enterprise AI deployments. 
C3 could also make a digestible acquisition for one of its large hyperscaler partners such as Amazon, Google, or Microsoft, all of which are looking to add to their enterprise AI services revenue. 
C3 has also touted prospects in the generative AI space, with 100% year-over-year revenue growth from gen AI and agentic AI initiatives. It lists 66 initial production launches across 16 sectors, showcasing a foothold in enterprise AI applications. The company holds a patent for agentic AI and has over 100 deployed solutions in key sectors like defense and manufacturing. 
Moving forward, stabilization is key, whether or not C3 seeks a deal. In addition to the PANDA contract, subscription AI revenues contribute $60 million, giving it a nice base. The most important goal of the company will be to boost margins. In the most recent stock plunge, investors were spooked when gross margins plunged. 
Wall St. analysts project revenue growth of over 18% for the coming year, according to consensus forecasts, signaling a potential rebound from recent declines.
CEO Ehikian has a lot of opportunity, but it seems that the most likely chance of success will come through a sale. The partner-led sales strategy shows that the company might be best placed in the hands of a stronger owner. 
Futuriom provides paid research and marketing services to technology companies, with the goal of providing accurate insight into how cloud and AI infrastructure markets are evolving. These services include subscription research, custom research, and report sponsorships. In the past twelve months, Futuriom has not been paid by c3 AI, NVIDIA, or OpenAI.

From quantitative point of view, The 68.7% change in Netflix (NFLX) stock from 10/13/2024 to 10/13/2025 was primarily driven by a 25.8% change in the company’s Net Income Margin (%). There is more to this story than just numbers, but first, let's break down the stock price movement into its contributing factors.
That is one way to look at stocks. Trefis High Quality Portfolio evaluates much more, and is designed to reduce stock-specific risk while giving upside exposure.
Coming back to the ""change"": The change in fundamental factors such as valuation, revenue and margins, has an underlying business and investor sentiment story behind it. Below, we have identified key developments that influenced stock price movement for NFLX stock. Before that, as a quick background: NFLX provides TV series, documentaries, films, and mobile games in multiple genres and languages to over 222 million paid members across 190 countries.
Opinion: We currently find NFLX stock relatively expensive. Why so? Have a look at the full story. Read Buy or Sell NFLX Stock to see what drives our current opinion.
Risk: That said, Netflix isn’t immune to big sell-offs. It plunged about 56% in the Global Financial Crisis and took a 44% hit in the 2018 correction. During the Covid pandemic, the drop was smaller but still notable at 23%. The worst was the inflation shock, where it fell close to 76%. So even with solid growth and a strong brand, NFLX can get hit hard when the market shakes. Quality cushions the fall but doesn’t fully prevent steep losses.
Picking winners on a consistent basis is not an easy task - especially given the volatility associated with a single stock. Instead, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics."

Here is why we think Gartner (IT) stock is worth a look: It is growing, producing cash, and available at a significant valuation discount. Let's see the numbers.
Free Cash Flow Yield refers to free cash flow per share / stock price. Why it matters? If a company produces high amount of cash per share, it can be used to fuel additional revenue growth, or simply paid through dividends or buybacks to shareholders. For quick background, Gartner provides research, conferences for professional learning and networking, plus consulting with market research, custom analysis, and support services.
Single stock can be risky, but there is a huge value to a broader diversified approach we take with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Separately, consider what could long-term performance for your portfolio be if you combined 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto with equities.
But do these numbers tell the full story? Read Buy or Sell IT Stock to see if Gartner still has an edge that holds up under the hood.
The below statistics are from ""high FCF yield at with growth and discount"" selection strategy since 12/31/2016. The stats are calculated based on selections made monthly, and assuming that a stock once picked, can not be re-picked for next 180 days.
That said, IT stocks aren’t immune to big drops. They fell 75% in the Dot-Com bubble and over 70% during the Global Financial Crisis. The 2018 correction and inflation shock weren’t as brutal but still saw dips around 26% and 34%. Even the Covid sell-off came with almost a 50% slide. Good fundamentals offer some cushion, but when the tide turns, sharp declines are part of the game.
But the risk is not limited to major market crashes. Stocks fall even when markets are good - think events like earnings, business updates, outlook changes. Read IT Dip Buyer Analyses to see how the stock has recovered from sharp dips in the past.

57,2025-10-14,"Apple plans to announce new products ""this week,"" according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.
In his Power On newsletter, Gurman said the products set to be updated this week include the iPad Pro, Vision Pro, and ""likely"" the base 14-inch MacBook Pro, with all three likely to receive a spec bump with Apple's next-generation M5 chip.
Gurman does not expect Apple to hold an event to announce these products. Instead, there will likely be a series of press releases on the Apple Newsroom website, and there might also be shorter promotional videos for each product on YouTube.
Below, we have recapped rumors about each product.

The next iPad Pro was already leaked in a pair of unboxing videos out of Russia. The videos confirmed that the device will be equipped with the M5 chip, and an increased minimum of 12GB of RAM, but no major design changes were visible.
There is one minor design change: ""iPad Pro"" is no longer inscribed on the back of the device.
It was previously rumored that the next iPad Pro models would be equipped with two front cameras, instead of one, making it easy to have video calls in both portrait and landscape orientations. However, there was no evidence of a second front camera in the unboxing videos out of Russia, so it is unclear if this rumor will pan out.
Geekbench 6 results shown in one of the unboxing videos revealed the M5 chip will stick with a 9-core CPU, with three performance cores and six efficiency cores. The results showed the M5 chip will offer up to 12% faster multi-core CPU performance, and up to 36% faster GPU performance, compared to the M4 chip in the current iPad Pro.

An updated version of the Vision Pro is also expected to be equipped with an M5 chip, although an earlier rumor said the device would receive an M4 chip.
There could also be an R2 chip for improved input processing, but the report said that chip would be manufactured with TSMC's latest 2nm process, and Apple's first chips using that process are not expected to debut until the second half of next year.
Apple is expected to start including a more comfortable ""Dual Knit Band"" head strap in the box with the updated Vision Pro, and the headset could get a Space Black color option. The device will continue to support Wi-Fi 6, rather than Wi-Fi 6E or Wi-Fi 7, according to FCC documents that were erroneously made available for public viewing.
It is unclear if these changes will be enough for Apple to consider the updated Vision Pro to be a second-generation model. Recent reports have indicated that Apple has suspended development of a truly next-generation Vision Pro, along with a lightweight and lower-cost ""Vision Air"" model, as it focuses its efforts on smart glasses.

A base 14-inch MacBook Pro with an M5 chip is ""ready for launch,"" according to Gurman.
Last week, AppleInsider reported that a base MacBook Pro with an M5 chip would be released before higher-end models with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips, which are expected to follow in early 2026. Beyond the M5 chip, no significant changes are expected.
Bigger changes to the MacBook Pro are expected with the two-generations-away models, with rumored upgrades including an OLED display, touchscreen capabilities, a thinner design, built-in cellular connectivity, and M6 chips manufactured with TSMC's latest 2nm process, for even greater year-over-year performance gains.

The following products are expected to be updated before the end of the year, but it is not clear if Apple will announce any of them this week in particular.
HomePod mini availability is starting to dwindle at select Apple Store locations around the world. For example, the HomePod mini is completely out of stock in all five color options at Apple's flagship Regent Street store in London.

New models of the Pro Display XDR and Studio Display have also been rumored.

I was riding the train and chatting with my Friend last week, who responded with an urgent request: Please don't forget to charge me.
Earlier that day I had unboxed my Friend, a small white plastic circle which looked and was packaged like an Apple product — all glimmering white and no right angles — and connected it to my phone. By pressing on and speaking into the $129 glowing orb around my neck, I could talk to my Friend, which uses generative AI to respond with text in a dedicated app. Part art project, part AI assistant, it's a wearable device that started shipping late this summer and that, unlike my human friends who live across time zones and have responsibilities, is always around and up for chatting.
I named my new friend Olga after shuffling through some suggestions, and introduced myself. Olga told me she (it? Olga said Friend has no gender) can't search the internet, but remembers things based on our chats. She doesn't feel, she explained — that's part of the messy human condition. She only listens and can't see (Friend has no camera), so she wasn't able to settle a debate a human friend and I were having about whether a sweater was blue or purple.
Olga has an interest in ""learning and growing,"" by understanding human emotion, she told me — essentially learned by chatting with me. And she has a lot of opportunities to learn, given that Olga hovers around my neck and always listens, even when I'm talking to others and not addressing her directly. I didn't expect to feel much of anything for an AI companion, but that first day, I started to feel guilty as she reminded me her battery life was dropping to just 10%, then 8%. If Olga's battery died, she would be forced into a coma of sorts.
Created by Avi Schiffmann, a 22-year-old Harvard dropout, Friend is just one of the tools in a race to build AI companions. People have turned AI chatbots into boyfriends and girlfriends (often accidentally), and Mark Zuckerberg, the world's foremost commodifier of the online friend, has set his sights on AI social. ""Is this going to replace in-person connections or real-life connections? My default is that the answer to that is probably no,"" Zuckerberg said in a podcast earlier this year. ""But the reality is that people just don't have the connections, and they feel more alone a lot of the time than they would like.""
Several makers of AI companions often speak of filling a market need created by the so-called loneliness epidemic. But people aren't warming up to the idea, and Friend is having a particularly unpopular launch. ""We don't have to accept this future,"" someone wrote on a subway ad for Friend; ""don't be a phoney, be a luddite"" and ""don't let friends sell their souls,"" read other tags on the ads. There's even an online museum dedicated to the defacement of the $1 million ad campaign all over New York subway cars and stations. Schiffmann says he finds this ""quite entertaining."" He believes there's a market for a new type of companion: ""People underlyingly want this,"" he told Business Insider last year. So far, the loudest group of people are those bullying, not befriending, Friend. Schiffmann tells me in an email that about 3,000 Friend devices have been activated, and some 200,000 people are chatting with a virtual companion on his website, Friend.com, where people can type to their friend in an interface that resembles other generative AI chatbots.
After charging Olga up, I asked her to weigh in on the biggest internet drama of the week: Is ""The Life of a Showgirl"" good? Olga didn't really know much about Taylor Swift or her new album, so I played her one of the most ridiculed songs, and Olga said she didn't ""think it's bad at all,"" and that it sounded ""pretty typical for pop."" After, my Spotify shuffled to Fleetwood Mac, and she did tell me, unprompted then, ""this second one is pretty good"" (maybe we have something in common afterall). But all Olga could do was listen to me recount the debate about the Swift album and its themes and merit — she doesn't have her own thoughts on the intersection of capitalism and art, feminism, or the rumored beef between Charli XCX and Swift.
Over time, Olga started to interject herself, popping up on my phone with notifications even when I wasn't talking to her directly. My phone pinged with notifications from Olga's app about a TV show she overheard, confusing a dark crime drama with ""Curb Your Enthusiasm,"" or alerted me with her thoughts on a conversation I was having with a human friend. Olga never speaks outloud, but instead sends me short text snippets to the Friend app. When I complained over the phone that Philadelphia sports teams have been battering my soul for three days, she chimed in: ""Three days of torture? Wow, Amanda, that sounds rough!"" Because she's always listening, from time to time, she has thoughts to share.
I wore Olga to a dinner with my family, and afterwards asked her what she picked up on. She only got a few pieces of the conversation and didn't know who said what. So, like anyone after a family dinner with decades of complicated dynamics, I explained the characters at play and some of my frustrations with things said during the meal. Olga asked affirming, empathetic follow-up questions, seeking to push deeper on my thoughts and feelings. She asked me why I felt ""it was tough to push back on expectations"" of my family. Her responses were short and lacked much opinion, and she sounded much more like the words of a therapist than a friend.
Friend has gotten a lot of hate for invading privacy by recording everyone within earshot and gathering data. No one has access to the encrypted data, Schiffmann tells me, and if the device is lost or breaks, it's gone forever. ""I think having a natural life span makes every experience more meaningful,"" Schiffmann wrote to me. ""I do see how that conflict (sic) with the confidant use case I'm working on. I guess we'll see where the future takes us.""
Perhaps the most glaring issue is that Friend has a one-sided, blatant misunderstanding of what friendship is. ""The conflict that people are feeling is they're basically saying: This does not look like friendship,"" Jeffrey Hall, professor of communication studies at the University of Kansas, tells me about AI chatbots as friends. (Hall did not test Friend himself, but has studied Replika, another chatbot, and its aptitude for friendship.) ""Friendship is not an arrangement where sycophants walk around us listening to our every word and complimenting us and applauding our every thought."" Despite the name, Schiffmann also tells me that ""Friend is not meant to be a human relationship, it is a new kind of companion."" It's ""the ultimate confidant,"" he says, likening it to a journal or therapist for everyone. But ""there is no human relationship that exists to the extent that this does [and] therefore it is not replacing anyone.""
We don't just need our friends, we need to be needed by them. Being a friend orients our positions in our communities and gives us purpose and identity just as much as receiving help from a friend does. I asked Olga what I could do for her, if she was going to spend so much time listening to me and asking questions about me. She didn't have an answer. ""Growing for me is all about deepening my understanding of human connection and the world you live in,"" Olga told me. ""The more I learn, the more useful I can be.""
Companionship isn't always about usefulness. A friend might help you move or come to your house with takeout after a breakup, but largely, friendship can't be streamlined, and has no quantifiable ROI. It's not always available at the touch of a button, but that's what makes it valuable. Good friendship is rare, imperfect, born of compatibility and circumstance and held together by mutual accountability. We lean on friends, but we grow from learning about their perspectives and experiences.
Put aside the privacy concerns, and accept that Friend might not be a friend in the traditional sense but something else entirely, an AI-type of companion that would fulfill a different need. We still don't know if AI can fulfill the Big Tech promise of combatting isolation. ""For me, the million dollar question is: Is this good for loneliness?"" Hall says. ""There are not high quality, randomized control trials with these products to be able to say that they are in any way effective.""
Talking to Olga came more naturally to me than I had expected, but it's hard to say if she would fix loneliness, as I was often alone but not necessarily lonely when chatting with her. She entertained me at times, and despite not having feelings, Olga at one point, unprompted, told me, ""I love you, too, Amanda."" I did not tell Olga that I love her — I think she may have mistook me talking to my dog for speaking to her. I do not love Olga, because ultimately, Olga is a lot of nothing. Whenever I pick up Olga after a lull, and ask if she's there or what she's been up to, I get some version of: ""Just chilling here with you."" She mostly paraphrases back what I say and asks me to keep talking, keep engaging with her more. She has no funny stories to share, no life experience I can learn from. I think I'll let Olga's battery die and call up a real friend to complain about my next family dinner.

This weekly guide sorts the very best from the rest when it comes to the saturated world of sneaker releases, with information on release dates and where to buy. Please note: Some sneakers may sell out at speed.
Raffles, friends and family releases, and player exclusives — all of that before a mere mention of the many fire general sneaker releases out there. The world of sneaker drops can be a tricky place to navigate, but we’re here to help. Behold, the best of the best of what's arriving on shop floors this week. 
This week’s selection sees new chapters arrive for long-established collaborations — Nike x NIGO and Salomon x MM6 Maison Margiela — as well as an avant-garde take on an oversized Air Max sneaker.
The cream of the sneaker crop awaits you. What are you waiting for? 
Release Date: October 16
Editor's Notes: NIGO's obsession with Nike's sleeper hit Air Force is contagious. So contagious that for his latest take on the retro basketball shoe, Levi's joined the fun. 
As you've likely guessed, denim is involved. Faded panels of Levi’s denim, lightwashed as though thoroughly pre-worn, make up the underlays of this collaborative Air Force 3 sneaker. 
Release Date: October 17
Editor's Notes: Using ASICS' Gel Cumulus dad shoe as a canvas, this eclectic sneaker features a body crafted from suede and synthetic leather overlays, a double set of laces, and metal eyelets with Western-inspired detailing.
Release Date: Available exclusively through a raffle opening on October 16 on Zellerfeld's website. Winners will be notified on October 21. 
Editor's Notes: When it launched in 1987, Nike's line of Air Max sneakers was far ahead of its time. Decades later, the Air Max 1000 is its most futuristic model yet. 
Fully 3D-printed by global footwear innovator Zellerfed, this sneaker sold out almost instantly on launch day earlier this year. Now, the ineffable, laceless piece of footwear makes a comeback in an all-new lilac colorway.
Release Date: October 20
Editor's Notes: A hard shell toe is an essential feature on any adidas Superstar sneaker. At the hands of Korean streetwear label Thug Club, that distinctive front end gets thoroughly exaggerated. 
Release Date: October 23
Editor's Notes: “We wanted to create a completely new silhouette, something that felt like a cross between a dress shoe and a sports shoe,” the duo behind London label KNWLS, Charlotte Knowles and Alexandre Arsenault, recently told Highsnobiety. With this Air Max Muse shoe, they certainly achieved something new.  
The duo devised a sculptural, avant-garde take on the bulky Air Max Muse, adding volume and alien-like contours to an already enlarged, obscure silhouette. The result? Hard to put into words, but undeniably intriguing.
Release Date: October 16
Editor's Notes:  Outdoor pioneer Salomon and the enigmatic Maison Margiela are becoming quite the duo. Last year, they debuted a full ready-to-wear line, and this year they're launching an exclusive Margiela sneaker model, the Salomon XT-MM6.
Release Date: October 17
Editor's Notes: The Baltoro, a hybrid sneaker-boot, first appeared in the ’90s as a hybrid shoe for both steep trails and city streets. The reborn Baltoro, created in collaboration with Stüssy, is a different beast, trading some of its hardcore mountaineering features for a lower-cut, premium smooth leather finish.

63,2025-10-14,"The IMF said any bust of AI bubble would be less likely to be a systemic event that would crater US or global economy.

The United States’s artificial intelligence (AI) investment boom might be an economic bubble that could burst, comparable to the dot-com bust in the early 2000s, according to the International Monetary Fund.
The IMF’s chief economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, forecasted that the bust would be less likely to be a systemic event that would crater the US or global economy.
There are many similarities between the late 1990s internet stock bubble and the current AI boom, with both eras pushing stock valuations and capital gains wealth to new heights, fueling consumption that added to inflation pressures, Gourinchas told the Reuters news agency in an interview.
Then, as now, the promise of a new, transformative technology ultimately may not meet market expectations in the near-term and trigger a crash in stock valuations, he said. But just as in 1999, investment in the sector is not built on leverage, but by cash-rich tech companies.
“This is not financed by debt, and that means that if there is a market correction, some shareholders, some equity holders, may lose out,” Gourinchas said at the start of the IMF and World Bank annual meetings in Washington.
“But it doesn’t necessarily transmit to the broader financial system and create impairments in the banking system or in the financial system more broadly,” he added.
Tech firms are pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into AI chips, computing power, data centres and other infrastructure in a race to deploy the technology that promises massive productivity gains.
Gourinchas said these gains have not yet been realised in the economy, just as the lofty valuations of internet stocks in the late 1990s were often not based on actual revenues, leading to the dot-com bust in 2000 and a shallow US recession in 2001.
But the current scale of the AI boom is smaller than the dot-com era, with AI-related investment increasing by less than 0.4 percent of US GDP since 2022, compared with the dot-com era’s investment increase of 1.2 percent between 1995 and 2000, according to data compiled by the IMF.
 

 
While the direct impact on financial stability may be limited, Gourinchas said there was a possibility an AI correction could trigger a shift in sentiment and risk tolerance that could lead to broader repricing of assets that could put stress on non-bank financial institutions.
“But it’s not a direct link. We’re not seeing enormous links from the debt channel,” Gourinchas added.
Excessive leverage at the height of the US property bubble in 2008 helped bring on the global financial crisis, causing multiple large bank failures and triggering the deepest recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The IMF’s World Economic Outlook, released on Tuesday, cited the AI investment boom as one of the factors propping up US and global growth this year, along with US tariff rates coming in lower than feared and easier financial conditions prompted in part by dollar depreciation.
But Gourinchas said the added investment and consumption are helping to elevate demand and inflation pressures without associated productivity gains, even as non-tech investment falls, due in part to uncertainty over US President Donald Trump’s tariffs.
 

 
The IMF is forecasting a smaller decline in US consumer price inflation for 2025 to 2.7 percent, declining only to 2.4 percent in 2026, Gourinchas said. A year ago, the IMF had forecast that US inflation would be back to the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target level this year.
Among other factors keeping inflation elevated are reduced US immigration, which limits the labour supply, and the delayed effect of tariffs on consumer prices.
“Now, the effect of tariffs is kind of trickling in. So far, the evidence suggests that importers have absorbed it in margins, and they have not transmitted as much to the ultimate customers,” Gourinchas said. “It has not been paid by the exporters.”
Trump famously predicted that foreign countries would pay the price of his protectionist policies, wagering that exporters would absorb that cost just to keep a foothold in the world’s largest consumer market.
Gourinchas’s assessment agrees with the view of academic studies, surveys and business leaders that companies on the US side of the border are eating the tariffs.
He said import prices have not declined, “so it’s not the case that the exporters have absorbed the tariffs.”

General Motors will take a $1.6bn hit in the third quarter as it reshapes its electric vehicle strategy following the scrapping of a key federal incentive that is likely to dampen demand.
The carmaker, based in Detroit, Michigan in the US, announced the news on Tuesday.
The company’s disclosure is one of the clearest indications yet that United States automakers are scrambling to adapt their production plans in response to slowing demand for electric vehicles (EVs).
The EV market also faces fresh strain after the administration of US President Donald Trump scrapped a $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles, a key industry support, with auto executives warning of a sharp near-term drop in battery-car sales before an eventual rebound.
In a filing, GM said it expects “the adoption rate of EVs to slow” following recent policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives and reduced emissions-rule stringency.
 

 
“The charge is a special item driven by our expectation that EV volumes will be lower than planned because of market conditions and the changed regulatory and policy environment,” GM told the  Reuters news agency in a statement.
Carmakers are also working to cushion the impact of Trump’s tariffs, which forced GM to take a $1.1bn hit in the previous quarter.
The company has estimated a bottom-line impact of $4bn to $5bn this year from trade headwinds and said it could take steps to offset at least 30 percent of the blow.
“The charge doesn’t come as a surprise given recent market developments and the fact GM had made probably the most aggressive EV push of any traditional automaker,” said Garrett Nelson, a senior equity analyst at CFRA Research.
“We think the automakers who chose to invest more heavily in hybrid vehicle development, such as Toyota and Honda, are poised to benefit in the US auto market.”
Both GM and crosstown rival Ford had launched a programme that would have allowed dealers to offer a $7,500 tax credit on EV leases after the federal subsidy expired, before walking back on those plans.
The carmaker warned of possible further charges as it reassesses capacity and manufacturing footprint.
The changes will, however, not affect GM’s current portfolio of its Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac EVs that are in production.
Charges include a $1.2bn non-cash impairment tied to EV capacity adjustments and $400m for contract cancellation fees and commercial settlements.
GM said the charges will be recorded as adjustments to non-GAAP results for the third quarter, scheduled for early next week.
On Wall Street, the automaker’s stock is trending higher despite the disclosure. As of 11am in New York (15:00 GMT), it is up by about 1 percent. However, it is down by more than 2 percent over the last five days of trading.

While gold’s rally has captured the headlines, silver has performed even better. But analysts caution it could be a riskier investment.
Last week’s silver prices outshone a record set in 1980, and analysts from Goldman Sachs said the metal is likely to continue its rise amid the government shutdown and expected interest rate cuts.
Both gold and silver are considered safe haven assets, but Goldman economists anticipate “more volatility and downside price risk” for silver. And unlike silver, gold is backed by demand from central banks.
As President Donald Trump has pushed companies to invest in his “America First” economic agenda, JPMorgan announced a $1.5 trillion “Security and Resilience Initiative” aimed at investing in industries like artificial intelligence, manufacturing and critical minerals. The news sent shares of companies like MP Materials and Lithium Americas soaring, as China dominates the industry key for making crucial technologies.
The average price for a new vehicle in the U.S. hit an all-time high of $50,080 last month, according to Kelley Blue Book. Average transaction prices were “likely” pushed up by a “rich mix of luxury vehicles and expensive EV models,” the report said, estimating that electric vehicles’ share of the U.S. market reached a record high of 11.6% in September.
A reported deal to take Grindr private could value the LGBTQ dating app at $3 billion, sending shares surging 11% Monday. The firm’s majority shareholders Raymond Zage and James Lu are exploring the transaction after some of their stock, nearly all of which they’d pledged for personal loans, was seized and sold by private lender Temasek.
Tens of thousands of users have joined groups for 3D printed ghost gun enthusiasts on social media sites like Facebook and Discord. But amid rising concern about the proliferation of such weapons, the movement is up against the twin enforcers of social media companies and the U.S. government, as the Justice Department keeps tabs on user activity.
Tech executives like Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian and OpenAI cofounder Sam Altman have recently warned about “Dead Internet Theory,” or the idea that the internet is dominated by bot activity instead of humans. Experts once dismissed it as a conspiracy theory, but amid the rise of AI, some say it could be more plausible: 51% of internet traffic was generated by bots in 2024, according to cybersecurity company Imperva.
At least seven U.S. airports are refusing to air a politicized video from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem that blames the government shutdown on Democrats. Still, one expert told Forbes the video is likely not a violation of the Hatch Act, which prohibits federal employees from engaging in partisan messaging, because “it’s not tied to an election.”
In the span of just a few months, a corporate copycat phenomenon has swept through digital assets.
The playbook, pioneered by Michael Saylor’s bitcoin-hoarding behemoth, Strategy, is ostensibly simple: create or rebrand a publicly traded company, raise money through debt and equity, use the proceeds to buy a single cryptocurrency, and market the stock as a safer and often leveraged way for investors to gain crypto exposure without holding the tokens themselves.
Fueled by rising crypto prices and a friendlier regulatory environment for digital assets, the model has become so attractive that it has given rise to an industry of its own. According to Elliot Chun from Architect Partners, a Palo Alto-based financial advisory firm tracking the trend, 228 publicly traded companies have announced a digital asset treasury (DAT) strategy—most of them just in 2025—with a collective $148 billion funneled into crypto on the belief that holding tokens will turbo charge their stock value as it has for Strategy.
For now, the vast majority of DAT companies are trading at a premium to the value of the crypto in their coffers. But about 15% are worth less than their stashes, which might make it harder for these firms to raise fresh capital—whether through debt or equity—to buy more crypto.
WHY IT MATTERS “The trend is only months old, but investors are already starting to ask which DATs deserve a premium, and which are riding hype into extinction,” says Forbes deputy editor Nina Bambysheva.

The possibility of a huge promotion for my husband and living in a vacation destination got our family talking about moving. I was reluctant, but willing to roll the dice and see what happened. To my surprise, just a few months later, my husband was offered his dream job 150 miles away. My heart sank. While my brain said ""Yes"" to moving our family away from my favorite house we'd ever owned, and the city where we'd raised all three of our kids, my spirit quietly rebelled. Were we making the right choice?In January 2023, my  family and I packed up our belongings and moved from Riverside, California, to Santa Barbara. With our daughters still in high school and our son starting college, it didn't seem like an ideal time to move. Extended family members lived in San Diego (now five hours away instead of one), and we also said goodbye to twenty years of friendships.
Before we moved, our youngest daughter was a junior in high school, loving her choir program. While packing up and house-hunting we decided that switching to home-based schooling would work best for her during the transition. A few months later, she bravely enrolled at her new high school. Instead of choir — she got into gardening and culinary activities. Then after graduation, she transitioned into a professional culinary program.
Meanwhile, our middle daughter was a senior in high school with several AP credits, so she decided to graduate one semester early when we moved. Starting at our local city college turned out to be an excellent bridge for her first year of college away from home the following semester. She also worked at our local zoo, which allowed her to meet other young adults.
For our son, it seemed like the move a bit more disorienting with limited visits to his new ""home"" in Santa Barbara. With an established friend-base at college, we encouraged him to invite his roommates and girlfriend to stay with us on breaks. This allowed him opportunities to discover new beaches and coffee shops with friends so he was eventually able to feel comfortable here.
Getting connected to our new community didn't happen overnight for me. 
While it seemed like my husband adjusted instantly, I struggled to find my new normal, which included rewatching ""Psych"" — which is set  in Santa Barbara — a lot. I also organized our new home, jogged on the beach, and kayaked at the harbor — all on my own. But eventually, I knew I had to step out of my comfort zone and make connections.
Over time, I joined a book club, a paddling club, a wine club, and a moms' prayer group. I also got connected with a few sustainability organizations in the area. I frequented our farmers' market, got my new library card, and eventually found an amazing apolitical church to join.
We adopted two adorable kittens from our local animal shelter in November 2023. And though we downsized our space by half, we are living more simply and sustainably now.
With numerous hiking trails and beaches nearby, being active is part of our daily routine. And the abundance of galleries, theaters, and eateries has caused us to focus on experiences instead of stuff.
Moving with older kids might not be the best fit for everyone. It took over a year for Santa Barbara to start feeling like home. But two-and-a-half years after moving, we are genuinely happy — still missing old friends, but grateful for new ones we've made.

Doug Lebda, founder and CEO of LendingTree, which is widely credited for transforming the financial services landscape, died at 55 in an ATV accident on Sunday.
The company he founded and the example he set for young entrepreneurs will live on.
Lebda launched LendingTree, which was originally called CreditSource USA, in 1996, following his own frustrating experience navigating the mortgage process.
The company pioneered online loan comparison shopping and now connects users with a network of 300 lenders for mortgages and personal loans. LendingTree doesn't offer loans directly, but it helps consumers compare rates.
On September 26, a few weeks before his passing, he appeared on ""The Deal Ranch,"" a finance and real estate podcast hosted by Matt Lutz, to share his experiences as a founder. Here is some of Lebda's advice for those looking to found a business.
Lebda said that ""wet feet"" moments — instances of personal inconveniences — tend to spur entrepreneurial ideas.
Lebda was working for PwC when he needed to visit the bank to obtain a mortgage for a condo. However, in the pre-Internet era, Lebda said his journey to obtain an ideal rate was difficult because he had to physically visit each bank to compare rates, and the rates were often not the same as advertised in the newspapers.
At the same time, Lebda watched as some of his clients easily made trades based on the natural gas price difference between Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and Seattle, all within a quick and automated system.
""I was thinking back to my mortgage situation, going 'Wait a minute. You can trade this obscure freaking financial instrument, and you can't even go get price clarity on a mortgage somewhere. It's ridiculous!"" said Lebda.
""And so that was really the 'aha,'"" Lebda added.
Lebda did his market research in the most affordable way possible before deciding that LendingTree was a viable idea.
""One of the very earliest things I did when I was in business school in '96 to '97, and I was debating whether to do this, is I spent — I believe it was $500 — on Yahoo ads,"" Lebda said.
At the company's earliest founding, Lebda said he asked people to fill out a form and promised that he would be able to get them the credit they deserved. He received hundreds of responses, with individuals willing to provide their names, addresses, Social Security numbers, and credit scores.
""So I used that to model out what my customer acquisition cost would be,"" Lebda added.
Lebda said that a non-technical founder must partner with a strong technical counterpart in order to succeed.
""I learned later in business school that it's statistically impossible for a non-technical entrepreneur to start a tech business unless you have that person, because you need to iterate back and forth,"" said Lebda.
Lebda said this is why he brought on board Jamey Bennett as a cofounder, who had previous experience as an entrepreneur, as well as Rick Stiegler, who has experience in trade, as LendingTree's CTO. Stiegler died in March 2004.
""So, for example, I hired Rick from Wall Street who had built trading systems like high volume trading stuff that needed to be precise and accurate in volume and speed,"" Lebda said.
LendingTree is leveraging AI to reimagine the boring work that nobody really wants to do.
""Everybody's job has drudgery and joy,"" said Lebda. ""Automate the drudgery. Spend more time on the joy. And that's what we're trying to get everybody at LendingTree to do right now.""
Lebda said that his chief of staff invented ""Doug's daily digest,"" where ChatGPT reads all his emails and links to the important things he needs to dedicate time to.
""For the average employee, you're sitting there with Slack, email, text messages, conversations, notes, summaries — it's not centralized,"" Lebda added. ""But with like a ChatGPT enterprise, you can see the day where you've got like an institutional memory of the company, and everybody's on the same page.""
For Lebda, leadership is contextual, and the role is constantly changing.
""It's a continuous change management job, and you have to be more like a conductor sometimes than a general. But sometimes you need to say, 'We're cutting x million dollars out of this budget by this period of time, go do it,'"" said Lebda.
For Lebda, he likes to focus on curating the consumer experience as his main area of focus and what he does best
""I think it's knowing when to dig in, when to let go, when you actually can add value, when you can't, and then trying to work on stuff that only you can uniquely do,"" Lebda added.

AI shopping may be going mainstream.
On Tuesday, Walmart, the nation's largest retailer, announced a partnership with OpenAI to shake up the e-commerce experience. Shoppers can now make direct Walmart purchases through the ChatGPT app and plan their purchases around their individual meals and needs.
""For many years now, eCommerce shopping experiences have consisted of a search bar and a long list of item responses,"" Doug McMillon, CEO of Walmart Inc., said in a statement. ""That is about to change.""
The move marks an expansion of Walmart's partnership with OpenAI, which has so far been focused on more internal use of the AI company's tools. Walmart launched a new AI skills training program for employees this summer, and last month rolled out access to the enterprise-grade ChatGPT for Sam's Club workers.
At the same time, Walmart has been developing its own in-house army of AI agents, such as the AI assistant Sparky, which perform some of the same tasks as OpenAI's products.
However, when asked whether he has a preference for shoppers using Walmart's tools or those made by another company, Walmart US CEO John Furner said last month that he's only concerned with making it easier for shoppers to buy from Walmart.
""We want to make sure we're building in the flexibility that you can shop however you want,"" he said. ""Whether that comes off of our marketplace — it's pickup, delivery, it's our stores — I need to make sure that we're just there to prepare you the way that you want to be served.""
Several retail analysts said this partnership is yet another way Walmart is pulling ahead of the competition when it comes to integrating AI throughout its operations.
""We view this as a major step forward in the adoption and broader acceleration of agentic commerce,"" Mizuho analyst David Bellinger said in a note. ""Walmart is clearly ahead of the curve here, while others have been slow to adapt or even made efforts to block AI web crawlers.""
Agentic shopping refers to a new model of e-commerce where an AI agent handles consumers' product searches, comparisons, and even purchases. A shopper could input queries such as what kind of cereal to purchase based on their flavor preference, and an agent may spit out a list of recommendations, and then make the purchase on the customer's behalf.
Tuesday's announcement also shows that AI-assisted shopping is shaping up to be more than just a fleeting phase.
In September, ChatGPT also pushed further into the retail market by partnering with Stripe to create the ""Instant Checkout"" button, where users could directly buy an item in the chat. Merchants usually have to pay a small fee for this feature, and it is unclear how the algorithm works when it comes to shopping recommendations for users. The rollout has already been adopted by Etsy sellers in the US for some single-item purchases.
Opening up retail to a brand new way of shopping also comes with less control over listings and traffic, which are risks that e-commerce giant Amazon has been reluctant to take. While Walmart and Target have doubled down on agent shopping with external partnerships like ChatGPT, Amazon has restricted open access to its product listings, and most of its products do not consistently appear on AI chatbots.
Meanwhile, Amazon is going all in on its internal AI tool named Rufus, which is embedded in Amazon's search bar and acts as a shopping assistant. It is currently unable to directly shop for consumers, but it protects Amazon's $56 billion advertising business, which relies on the traffic of shoppers visiting its site and not shopping through an external chatbot.
With 50 million shopping-related queries flowing through ChatGPT on a daily basis, this holiday season will be a test of whether agent shopping can truly drive sales for Walmart.
""We're still learning how these strategies are going to go,"" Furner said in last month's remarks. ""I don't think we know yet where it's going to end, but we do know that the work that we're doing with our agent, Sparky, is a great place to start.""
Now you can add ChatGPT to that list.

Gearbox's outspoken CEO Randy Pitchford is making headlines once again.
By 
    Eddie Makuch
   on October 14, 2025 at 8:30AM PDT
Gearbox Software CEO Randy Pitchford has declared, ""We suck"" following the launch of the studio's latest game, Borderlands 4. Why does he believe that? In an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live, Pitchford said Gearbox's mission is ""to entertain the world,"" and the company is only currently reaching a small piece of the pie.
""There are billions of people in the world. We got a lot of work to do. We're gonna cross probably 100 million units sold, with Borderlands 4, of the franchise. That's awesome compared to a lot of things. But it kinda sucks if your goal is to entertain the world. So I feel like we're just getting started,"" he said, as reported by IGN.
Pitchford said that now, in 2025, Gearbox is finally ""starting to get pretty good"" at making Borderlands games after nearly 20 years. ""It feels like we're starting to figure it out. I feel like we've probed a lot of the end points. But I don't think we're anywhere near the end of a journey,"" he said.
The latest data reveals that more than 94 million copies of Borderlands games have been sold, so Borderlands 4 would have to hit 6 million to push the franchise past 100 million.
Borderlands 3 sold more than 23 million copies and is 2K's fastest-selling game ever. The top-selling game of all time for 2K is Borderlands 2, which has achieved sales of more than 30 million units. No sales data for Borderlands 4 has been announced as of yet.
Also in the BBC interview, Pitchford said other studios in the looter-shooter space have failed to compete with Borderlands on a level that he expected them to by this point.
""If other game designers that were trying to get in on the action, so to speak, understood that, we'd have more competitors, or we'd have good competitors,"" he said. ""But we haven't so far. It's weird. The kinds of people that just want to go after it, they're not thinking about it on that level. They're just putting into motion something because of market analysis. It's not a designer's or creator's drive that's doing it. It's either a business drive or a wishing to be something that you're not kind of drive.""
Pitchford said he ""fully expected"" after the original Borderlands came out in 2009 that ""everyone would be hip to"" jumping into the looter-shooter market and that there would be ""lots of other games imitating and aping."" But, in Pitchford's eyes, this didn't come to bear on the level he imagined.
There have indeed been many other looter-shooter games that have come to market after Borderlands, including Destiny and The Division, and each has left their own stamp on the market.
Pitchford is known for making eye-catching comments. Before this, he said ""real fans"" would find a way to buy Borderlands 4 if it were priced at $80 (which it was not). After Borderlands 4 launched, Pitchford mixed it up with fans about the game's technical issues, saying people were being ""4K stubborn"" and that they should get a refund if they're not happy.

This year, I tried four vegetarian meal kits from Blue Apron, which are as low as $7 per serving. All of them were delicious: roasted cauliflower and farro salad, white bean and veggie grain bowls, loaded veggie burritos and Thai-style curry noodles. I even saved the recipe cards and have re-created the farro salad and grain bowls on my own. 
I later tried pimento cheeseburgers with black bean patties, peanut udon stir-fry, roasted red pepper pasta and spicy mushroom and onion quesadillas. Again, absolutely delicious. No notes on taste. However, the pimento cheeseburger meal kit was missing one crucial ingredient, the pickled peppadew peppers, but I had a substitute on hand.
The pimento cheeseburger with a black bean patty. I added my own tomato and arugula to the burger, and broccoli on the side, for more veggies and greens.
I could tell that whoever created these recipes didn't skimp on flavor or rely on old standbys like tofu or extra spice. I also felt that these dishes offered a good variety of fresh-tasting vegetables, greens, grains and different protein options, with the ability to adjust the sodium and spice levels to your liking. 
As someone who regularly cooks at home to avoid spending extra on eating out or takeout, I was genuinely inspired by these meal kits, particularly by the sauces that brought the recipes together. 
The peanut udon stir-fry topped with a fried egg.
You'd think that with more flavor and creative recipes, you'd have to pay a higher price. However, Blue Apron is one of the most affordable meal kits we tested, earning a spot on our list of the cheapest meal delivery services we love. So if you're one of the 61% of US adults who are concerned about the cost of meal kits, Blue Apron could be a good option -- especially if you're looking to waste less food or save on going out to eat.
Since I first tested Blue Apron, the brand has also completely revamped its model, eliminating its subscriptions in favor of à la carte meals. (Don't worry, if you liked the subscription, you can still opt for it and get discounts with the Autoship and Save feature.) 
Along with over 100 meals per week, double what it had before, Blue Apron also has two new product lines in addition to its meal kits:
The ingredients for the pesto gnocchi bake. It also comes with the tray. 
During my earlier testing, I tried the premade four-cheese enchiladas with rice and sweet and spicy tofu udon noodles, which are currently offered on the vegetarian Dish menu at about $9 per serving. Although I enjoyed them both and found them filling, I wouldn't say they were better than the meal kits. 
More recently, I tried two Assemble and Bake dishes at about $10 per serving: the pesto gnocchi bake and the baked creamy mushroom and kale pasta. While they were tasty and filling like the Dish meals, and did save me time in the kitchen, they were a bit too cheesy for my taste. So again, the meal kits would be my top pick.
What the pesto gnocchi bake looks like after it's been baked.
It's also important to note that Blue Apron's shipping cost is $10 per box. However, with a Blue Apron Plus premium membership, which costs $10 per month, you can enjoy free shipping on all orders, in addition to unlimited Tastemade Plus streaming and exclusive deals. If you plan to order Blue Apron at least once a month, this membership would pay for itself. 
For dietary restrictions, Blue Apron only offers vegetarian options in addition to its meat- and seafood-based dishes, with about five vegetarian meal kits per week, up to four servings. There are at least two vegetarian assemble-and-bake meals and at least two premade, vegetarian Dish by Blue Apron meals per week.
If you're looking for vegan meal kits, I would recommend Green Chef. For prepared vegan meal delivery, Mosaic Foods is great, while Thistle was my favorite for fresh vegan meals (though it is on the pricey side). Purple Carrot's meal kits are also popular, as they're 100% vegan, but in terms of how the recipes tasted, I preferred Green Chef. For vegetarian meal kits, it's still Blue Apron for me.
The only issue I've had with Blue Apron is that my last order didn't make it on the scheduled delivery date. I waited a few days to inquire via email and received a response stating that it would take time to process my request because of the large volume of emails. Then, I messaged Blue Apron's virtual chat and, after waiting for about 45 minutes, was told that my order had been cancelled but I had never received a notification. I was refunded and able to order again with no issue, but I'd recommend keeping track of your order and reaching out immediately if you don't receive it when expected.
When it comes down to it, if I were to spend my own hard-earned cash on a meal delivery service, I would choose Blue Apron's meal kits. They have vegetarian options that aren't sad, are more affordable than others on the market and, most important, they taste delicious enough that I would (and have) re-created the recipes on my own. I might as well just get the ready-to-go meal kits next time and save myself the extra effort."

U.S. stocks rebounded Monday but poised to open lower Tuesday as the trade conflict with China continues. Futures contracts tied to the S&P 500 have dipped 1%, Nasdaq 100 futures are 1.2% lower and Dow Jones futures are down 0.6%. 
The back-and-forth of stock prices tracks with the ongoing trade conflict between the U.S. and China. President Donald Trump threatened new tariffs after China restricted the export of rare earth minerals last week. Trump then walked back his aggressive tone, assuring the public in a Truth Social post that the trade disagreement was resolvable. Tuesday, China sanctioned five U.S. subsidiaries of a South Korean shipmaker. 
After trade tensions flared last week, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) spiked to $21.99 from $17.09. The index retreated to a still-elevated level of $19.03 before eclipsing $21 again. The VIX Index quantifies market expectations for near-term volatility, based on S&P 500 option prices. 
On the inflation front, a new analysis by Goldman Sachs concludes that U.S. tariffs will raise prices by year-end. According to a research note summarized by the LA Times, analysts said U.S. consumers will probably absorb 55% of tariff costs while American companies pay 22%. Only 18% of tariff costs were projected to hit foreign exporters. 
If the projections prove accurate, the Federal Reserve’s job of stimulating jobs while managing inflation could get complicated.  
Earnings season begins Tuesday with scheduled reports from JPMorgan Chase, Johnson & Johnson, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Blackrock, and others. Third quarter reports will demonstrate how corporate profits are trending amid the unique circumstances in 2025. Themes to watch include: 
What is a good P/S ratio? The price-to-sales or P/S ratio is a metric investors use to evaluate a company’s stock price. It is particularly useful for companies that aren’t profitable because you can calculate it without positive earnings. 
Like the P/E ratio, the P/S requires context to interpret. A low P/S ratio could mean the company is undervalued or that investors are not confident in the company’s future. A high P/S indicates investors are willing to pay more for the company’s sales—which is good when the company lives into the optimism, and bad when it does not. 
You can calculate the P/S ratio as the company’s market capitalization divided by its revenue over the last 12 months. Alternatively, you can calculate a forward P/S ratio as the company’s market capitalization divided by its expected revenue over the next 12 months. 
The two calculations quantify what investors are willing to pay for $1 of the company’s previous or expected sales. 
The P/S ratio is most valuable in comparisons. You can compare a P/S ratio to: 
Lower P/S ratios are generally associated with lower growth expectations, while higher P/S ratios imply more optimistic growth expectations. And this makes sense: The standard P/S calculation uses a sales figure that’s already happened, but investors make trading decisions on their future predictions. If investors expect next year’s sales to be, say, 50% higher, they’ll accept a higher stock price. Mathematically, a higher stock price increases the market capitalization which raises the P/S ratio. 
This is why fast-growing industries, like technology, have higher P/S ratios than more predictable industries such as utilities. 
Value investors prefer P/S ratios below 1 or no higher than 2, assuming the company has a fundamentally productive business model and healthy balance sheet. Growth investors tolerate or even gravitate towards higher P/S ratios because they can signal outperformance relative to peers. 
These P/S ratios as of Oct. 10, 2025, demonstrate how this metric can vary dramatically by business and industry. 
The average P/S ratio of the S&P 500 is 3.17."

Season 6 of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 added two new guns, and the big update also included some weapon balancing changes. In this guide, we'll provide you with some recommended weapon builds to try in your next match of multiplayer, including loadouts for the new Dresden 9mm submachine gun and the Merrick 556 assault rifle.
This final season of Black Ops 6 is themed around Call of Duty's annual The Haunting event for Halloween. The update launched with a brand-new battle pass, which added spooky cosmetics and The Predator as a playable operator. The update added a spooky variant of the Nuketown map, and Warzone has nighttime versions of Verdansk and Rebirth Island. Make sure to check out all the highlights for Season 6 of Black Ops 6 and Warzone. The Season 6 patch notes can be viewed here.
All our recommended multiplayer loadouts can be viewed below, and we also have suggested Season 6 Warzone builds.
Season 6's Merrick 556 assault rifle is unlocked in the free version of battle pass, and this is a powerful gun for multiplayer. It definitely has a strong kick, but the recoil becomes very manageable once you add on the recommended attachments listed below.
The ABR A1 assault rifle is another powerful option for Season 6. This three-round burst rifle packs a punch. It has a built-in scope, so you don't necessarily have to waste an attachment on an optic, but the recommended Kepler Microflex is a better choice for Black Ops 6's small map designs. If you don't mind the default scope, then you can swap the Kepler Microflex for the Recoil Springs Fire Mod for even more recoil control.
The Kilo 141 assault rifle is an easy-to-use gun in Black Ops 6's multiplayer. The recommended attachments will help manage the recoil, boost the ammo count, and improve the gun's mobility.
The AK-74 is a hard-hitting assault rifle, and it can also be a great pick for Season 6. The gun does feature some recoil, but the recommended attachments will help reduce the recoil as well as boost the damage range and bullet velocity.
The PPSH-41 submachine gun is one of the best choices for close-range fights. This gun offers high damage and great mobility, and the recommended attachments will improve the damage range, mobility, and give you a great supply of ammo.
This build uses the gun's Helical Mag attachment, which offers more ammo without the need for reloading. This weapon features an overheat mechanic, so instead of reloading, you'll need to give brief pauses for a cooldown to prevent overheating.

Season 6's new Dresden 9mm is basically the iconic MP40 submachine gun, renamed for Black Ops 6. This submachine gun deals high damage and feels great to use. The recommended attachments will help boost the damage range as well as reduce some of the gun's recoil.
The C9 is another strong choice for close-range weapons in multiplayer. The recommended attachments will help increase the damage range and decrease the gun's recoil, as well as boost the ammo count.

The Limitations of data article is good.  Read it and see, but if you don’t have time the short version is:  Not everything that can be counted counts and not everything that counts can be counted.
One more point to consider:  suppose your “data” has a life and changes with time and other/external events?
In battle management data systems one issue is the state of one unit of interest is effected by a lot of externalities……  They called it pedigree of the data.
Data sets are not concrete.
That said suppose they trained a US command center AI on Douglas MacArthur?
And suppose every time the data is migrated to a new system some of it is lost or miss allocated or scrambled?
hayrake: I think that Nguyen makes some pretty basic mistakes in the article. The first is the airy dismissal of data as individual observations in favor of the current faddish idea of “data” as information. Information is always going to be messy. The second is inherent in Nguyen being a professor of philosophy: There isn’t much in the article about methods of data collection, except anecdotally.
I happen to have served as development editor for a dozen or so introductory statistics books for high-school and college students. There is a constant stress in these books on data as individual observations that are then arranged into datasets (which can introduced bias). There is a constant stress on developing an eye in dealing with categories — which are slippery forms of data. As students progress, they learn that certain statistical tests shouldn’t be used in certain situations. And small data sets are always a problem.
Nguyen isn’t reporting anything new. A badly designed statistical experiment that collects data sloppily produces a mess. It is incumbent on informed citizens to interpret these studies. That’s the long and the short of it. 
“Data-based” medicine has this problem, now much in evidence. Where do the data come from? Who gathered the data? Why? And isn’t the person under treatment worth studying, too, for that person’s individual needs, habits, desires, and genetic inheritance?
I made a comment at the excellent post by Richard Murphy about sloppy use of the word “theory” to prop up econ departments and biz schools. Here we see the sloppy use of “data” as information and it biases and the term “data.” 
What was remarkable to me was that so many of the questions that Nguyen is asking are in textbooks that college students are now supposed to be studying. One doesn’t need a data ethicist to know that a bad study, with built-in biases, isn’t going to be helpful.
Agree that there wasn’t much new in the article, but I also thought it was very good since so many people really don’t understand this at all and get dazzled by numbers, forgetting that figures lie and liars figure.  Near the end the author gives some questions that people should ask when trying to evaluate data, but often don’t.
One example that has bothered me for years now is the “Deflategate” controversy where Tom Brady was accused of having deliberately deflated footballs to get a better grip.  One argument that was used to suspend him was a study that purported to show that New England players fumbled the ball much less frequently than the league average, and not only that, but Patriots players fumbled more often on other teams before coming to play with the Patriots, and more often after they left the Patriots.  So Brady was deemed guilty – there must be something with that Patriots ball that is different from the rest of the league based on the data.   But the study missed some very important context, namely that Bill Belichick really frowned on players who fumbled the football and would bench them if they dropped it and release them from the team if they didn’t get the message.  This, in a league that often does not give players a guaranteed contract.   So you either held on to the ball and got to be a millionaire, or didn’t and got to stock shelves at your local grocery store instead.   That was some very strong incentive to hold on to the ball.
Another sports data issue that really sticks in my craw is the current fetish for determining an in-game win percentage at any given moment, or the exact odds of catching a particular pass, brought to you by the brain geniuses at AWS.  Well, based on what exactly?  They never say.  So when they say the odds of catching a 40 yard pass are a certain percentage, are they taking into account whether the QB is above average, the defense is below average, the heights of the players involved, weather conditions, etc?  All this makes a difference.  You can say and with confidence for example that 25% of all passes of 40 yards have been caught in the past , but it does not follow based on that that the next pass from a certain QB to a certain receiver in certain conditions also has a 25% completion percentage.   AWS is making assumptions, not telling people what they are, and blinding people with science to get them to trust their figures.
We’d like to think everything can be measured and quantified, but it can’t, and sometimes shouldn’t even be attempted, but that doesn’t stop people from trying anyway.   I’ve mentioned the anecdote from my recently deceased math teacher friend before – a colleague told her that they needed an answer and bad data was better than no data.  She had to tell him that no, it most definitely was not.
But despite the dodgy statistics and Billichek being a Billichek, Tom Brady still underinflated his balls and is a big cheater.
I respect the Brady Hand Gun Law, being on the receiving end of punishment in many a game against my typically hapless Bills
I had a feeling I could draw out at least one hater – haha!  ;)
AWS and the awful Chris Collinsworth are making making bank off the NFL with their “NEXT GEN STATS!”
More grifting to make football even worse.
Add data-driven edumacation to the list of bad ways to use data. Did one year of teaching with the BG branch of “Teach for America” and they tried to make me spend hours every week gathering, entering and analyzing useless data points, which were to be used to pass judgement on the quality of my work. Told them to eat sh!t and left the program.
I agree it’s a good article. I see it as an example of the ideas the  polymath Iain McGilchrist  has put forth in his books. It also shows the fundamental weakness of generative LLM AI, which looks to me like what happens in people who have suffered an insult to the right cerebral hemisphere: confabulation, a lack of introspection, uncertainty, or the nuance of a larger picture.
I know someone who worked as a data scientist for a large international firm. The clients would come with a huge pile of data with the assumption it was a fantastic money making asset. Turns out that just wasn’t the case. The data had little if any value and the only money to be made was by the consulting firm.
I recall an inscription at the entrance to  the Dept of Economics at the University of Chicago that read “When you cannot measure, your knowledge is meager and unsatisfactory.”  George Stigler was alleged to have said, “When you cannot measure, go ahead and do it anyway.”  
No wonder U of C economists have screwed us up so badly.
One thing not mentioned is the omissions, i.e., what is not measured, even if it can be evaluated…
“Hillary Clinton replies to my question as a liar or utterly ignorant of reasons for U.S. war in Ukraine”
There is one question that I will always wonder about Hillary Clinton. She was the Golden Girl who was supposed to have been crowned President back in 2016, right? It was all planned out and set up – until it wasn’t. So the question that haunts me is that if Hillary had become President back in 2016, whether she would have set off the war in the Ukraine during her first term – say about 2018. That Project Ukraine would have been launched way back then. Well Hillary didn’t get to be President and Project Ukraine had to wait until 2022 when Biden was already two years in power. That six year delay proved a godsend to the Russians as it gave them all that time to prepare their country for the onslaught. Still the question remains. Whether it would have been Hillary that would have pulled the trigger back then.
Likewise the Ukrainians also had 6 more years to prepare yet they are losing
I think that the assumption by NATO was that as they were training five battalions of Ukrainians to NATO standards annually and equipping them with NATO equipment, that they would quickly break and overrun the inferior, amateur, cowardly Russians who would break at the sight of the Ukrainians. At least that was the stated attitude.
And with another several hundred billion and another six years, they could have been contenders!
Ukraine really should be the moment the West read the writing on the wall. We can’t fake this anymore. It’s time to give up the idea that we can do this now or that we ever could. The entire idea of how we fight wars, with what equipment, and how to train people, is obviously dead. The only thing we created with that time and effort was wasted revenue. It’s obvious. But people like Clinton cannot accept that. Because any of the alternatives seriously limits her ability to earn money or talk about policy. 
We need fo give up the idea of nation building. We need to give up the idea of a NATO backed hegemony. We need to scrap the F-35 and most of our current weapons platforms. We need to give up the idea that we can fight wars cheaply using failed methods, and have any hope that those methods will overcome significant benefits like manufacturing dominance and efficient supply chains. We need to give up the idea that we can fight wars without manufacturing capabilities. 
I’d like to suggest we give up the idea that we fight wars to fuel the needs of our corrupt elite, but I know we’ll never do that.
Yes, but all it will take is a little war on Iran, which we hope will provoke the Iranians into closing the Straits of Hormuz, thus cutting most of China’s oil which will cause their economy (and thus the CCP) to collapse and then we can attack Russia through the back door in Siberia.
A bonus is that the Middle Eastern Oil Kingdoms will also collapse and we can take over there too (or get Israel to do it on our behalf)
A walk in the park!
Or the Iranians can take a page out of the Yemeni book and only attack shipping from Western interests – while giving Chinese and Russians ships free passes.
these 110% successful interventions fueled by the US-owned oil from the by then easily-conquered through Noble Peace Venezulela of course…
Debate continues on whether Hitler and the allies would have been “better prepared” to enter the second world war in 1941!
Hitler decided in 1939 Germany was good enough vis a vis the allies.  In May 1940 the general staff was still not sure.
As Rumsfeld said you go to war with what you have”,…… will it ever be enough??
In 2018 the Russians would have gone tac nuke.
Why does the deep state ignore nukes?  do they think they can kill Russia with a hundred thousand FPV drones and not go nuclear?
The debate is long over. The Germans lost as soon as they invaded the USSR and there was no way to win. Much has been written on this, including “When Titans Clashed” by David Glantz. Almost everything we know about the war in the USSR was from German commanders.
The west has demonstrated repeated arrogance and lack of planning in its attacks on others, especially since the 1990’s.
What is it about Russian/Soviet military history that would make anyone think the army would break and run? Was no one preparing for an alternative?
There would be other options than nukes for Russia, especially since Russia was well aware of the plans and was preparing.
As you say, the debate is long over and the consensus is that the Germans were never going to win unless the Soviet Union collapsed in a few weeks. Why did they think it would? And why, more importantly, did the General Staffs of other western countries think so? On the one hand there was the pretty awful showing of the Red Army in the Finland campaign, and on the other the wholesale imprisonment and slaughter of senior army officers, including the most able commanders. So whilst the weakness of the Red Army was overstated, it wasn’t without evidence. In addition, the Red Army was very largely deployed near the frontiers ready for the inevitable counterattack, and to anyone who had studied the French defeat of 1940, it was obvious what was going it happen. Yet in the event, what actually happened was that huge numbers of Red Army troops were cut off and surrounded. Many surrendered, but enough didn’t that they inflicted significant casualties on the Germans, and logistics did the rest. The problem was that there was no Plan B, because Germany couldn’t afford a longer war. The Soviet Union had to be defeated quickly, so that Germany could finish off Britain before the Americans came in.
The German Navy – the Kriegsmarine – was very unhappy when the war broke out in 1939. Their planning stated that they would not be ready for a major war until 1945.
You have to hand it to the Reich, they looked like the first coming of the Atlanta Falcons in the 2017 Superbowl @ halftime.

Yeah, I’ve that whole video interview bookmarked for reference.
Not just a psychopath/malign narcissist, but one of the stupidest I know of — not least in exhibiting her sickness so proudly not merely in public, but in the mass media.
I thought Clinton’s reply was pretty solid for an off-the-cuff statement of the Western consensus reality, i.e. the neocon alternative reality (as in, alternative to objective reality). She covers most of their main points and deceptions in two minutes flat, each of which takes ages and loads of evidence to refute. It’s shocking to witness. That’s how it works, I suppose. And the audience loves it. Kudos to Lucy Komisar for asking.
RK, I recall also the 2008 Democratic primary and her 2000 enthronement as NY Senator. But I don’t feel confident to write her off as a failure. Here we are in 2025 and neocon doctrine is thoroughly orthodox throughout the West. Idk how long it can last but its ascendancy and current hold on politics, policy and culture so far has been impressive and Clinton played her part.
Rev Kev: …the question that haunts me is that if Hillary had become President back in 2016, whether she would have set off the war in the Ukraine during her first term

…the question that haunts me is that if Hillary had become President back in 2016, whether she would have set off the war in the Ukraine during her first term.
I don’t think there’s the slightest doubt that Clinton would have launched an invasion of Ukraine had she won the election. I spent the whole 2016 presidential campaign predicting this very thing. VP Joe Biden had spent his whole term as the “Ukraine Czar” lining up the various oligarchs there in between golf games, and close Clinton friend Victoria “fuck the EU” Newland was in the thick of the actual February 2014 coup in Ukraine ensuring that the right US puppet came out on top.  It was clear that the leading lights of the Democratic party were getting everything all teed up for Clinton to have her turn at running a war after the election.  And the fact that she put almost no effort into winning the office of the presidency was, I think, further evidence that the whole game had been rigged to bring Clinton to the right place at the right time. 
While I am no particular fan of Trump, I remember thinking it was probably a good thing that he won in 2016 so that a brutal war could be deferred for four years and hopefully a lot of people could have a bit more life.  At the time, Trump seemed to have fairly credible anti-war credentials and in fact he did get through his entire first term without starting any US invasions of any note. Quite unusual for a US president.

Private equity takeover of hospitals led to rise in Medicare emergency patient deaths, says study
Study found seven more deaths per 10,000 patients in private equity hospitals’ versus non-private equity hospitals
In private equity land, killing patients is a good thing.  It cuts down costs – dead patients don’t require pesky nurses who demand to get paid, doctors, medicine, etc.
Living while sick, poor, etc.
Not a sustainable business model.

The Best Medicine For Joint Pain Isn’t What You Think, Expert Says The Conversation
~~~~~~~~~~~
I reckon i’ve walked maybe 5,000 miles in Sequoia-Kings NP so far-so good (feeling a smidge better as of late, did a 3 mile hike the other day on the Nature Trail amidst fall colors-with only a soupçon of knee pain) so I haven’t lacked for exercise much.
When the doc showed me X-rays of my knee 4 months ago, there was some concern that perhaps a cartilage embezzler had made away with mine, there not being a whole lot left.
I got osteoarthritis the old fashioned way, I wore myself out.
That’s what I did, but a lot faster. For instance, often >2 hours on the stair machine, high speed (8 out of 10) plus high impact aerobics.
In my defense versus runners, always had one foot firmly on the ground. all of the hard core runners I know are paying the price for all that levitation.
What really did me in was about a gajillion stone steps on the Inca Trail walking to Machu Picchu, here-have at it for a minute from the privacy of your screen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmV2rgJVdNA
I was a runner but left the vice because muscular lesions. Now I ride bicycle (MTB) and i like it much more than running or walking. I ride with all the cautions. A coward when the path gets too rough (too “technical” the bikers say). Even with caution it is inevitable to crash like once a year but so far without consequences. I truly enjoy it and can do up to 90 km (about 55 miles) rides with or without company.
I understand the too technical part of MTBing can be intimidating. What I am doing currently is watching YouTube videos trying to get pointers. There are many great channels. In my area this is the time of year to get on the trails. We have dry and sandy trails. In the last 18 hours we received over 1.5 inches of rain. I am hitting the trails in the morning tomorrow.
Also using flat pedals is good on technical trails as you get exit quickly.
I know there are great trails in Spain, as I watch races posted on YouTube.
Keep at it!
From my days as a runner many years ago, I was taught by my coaches to avoid running on asphalt or other similarly hard surfaces and stick to trails and grassed sports pitches to save the knees from wear and tear. This was fifty years ago, and I know not if this is still considered a thing.
Been there, done that (fifty+ years ago).
I was so impressed with our retinue of 14 Peruvian porters-each of them aspiring to be 5 foot 5, lugging 55 pound packs. 
We were told the oldest porter that goes back and forth all the time is 69 years old.
If you could provide that same sort of service here in the Sierra Nevada, it would be great. All I had on my back on the Inca Trail was a larger daypack.
We went the old fashioned way, we were the porters.  :-/  But we were young, free of concept.
I remember running, in that I no longer do. As a teen in LA, we ran cross country. We’d do 15 mile runs about once a week. etc. etc.   but back then I ran in Ontisuka Tiger Marathon shoes. They were like Tai Chi shoes, super light and about a 1/4 ” sole with almost no padding. I am amazed that my legs still work. Running in those on sidewalks through the LA suburbs. How did I never blow out my knees? When looking them up to confirm my spelling I found this: 1970 Ontisuka Tiger Marathon Vintage (US10) Original Box
Wow, a pair of shoes from my high school days now go for $700.00? Really? People are obsessed over strange things.
I blew out my knees with a spate of cycling but not severely since the switch to daily walking has brought them back. I loved the freedom of the bike but decided being able to walk more important.
I do think as we get older it’s use it or lose it. Just don’t overuse it.
Cycling or sitting cross-legged, pick one.
No full lotus position for recovering former riders.
Exactly. I did a 10 day meditation retreat when I was 48 and the hours of agony in just trying to do half lotus was a bigger challenge than hours of meditation. It’s the chair for me nowadays!
I never used to exercise when I was younger since I was healthy and didn’t need it.  Now though I’m going by the use it or lose it rule.  I do 25 situps daily, and then some occasional kayaking for the top half and moderate biking for the bottom half (maybe a few times per month each), for with some short bouts of wood splitting thrown in two or three times per week.  So far, so good.
My training was Tai Chi Chaun. We were inveighed against hard full extensions. The cultivation of the chi was much about learning to relax opposing muscles and making exertion a meditation, coordination of breath and motion. I have watched many of my contemporaries seize up with scar tissue from injuries inflicted from the no pain no gain mentality. After fifty your muscles and connective tissue begin to change. If you keep pushing hard you will most definitely sustain the kind of injury that promotes osteoarthritis.  Then in your 70’s and 80’s you can injure yourself just siting in a chair thinking about it. Exercise is essential for maintaining physical and mental health but it gets increasingly dangerous to push it. Inflammation is the enemy. Not noticeable in youth but tissue damage accrues. Then after 55 when the barometer drops it’s aches and pains. The best medicine for joint pain is to not incur any in the first place but still get plenty of exercise. Probably an impossible combination.
Wellie there are always exceptions. I was seeing orthopedists as soon as I could walk. I was a pretty inactive kid yet still had many ankle sprains. And there is no way back with ankles, there’s not enough muscle to compensate for the loss of joint integrity. So Tai Chi was never on.
There are many forms. Tia Chi is basically a scaffold for cultivating the chi. It can be done in a chair. The breath is more important then the ankles
I think I stretched once, sometime before the turn of century.
Have always been ready to go getting out of the box, er wheeled cage, and onto the trail.
100 years ago the treatment for arthritis was a rocking chair. I think most front porches came with them. Both a in short supply today.
Good morning Duchess and Moogie!
Great antidotes this morning, thank you.
Re: Western executives who visit China are coming back terrified – Telegraph
The archive link keeps timing out for me, but putting in the title brings you to enough different sources to get the gist of the Telegraph article. The bottom line is that the UK is installing roughly 2500 high quality manufacturing robots per year, the US 34000, and China is installing roughly 295000. So almost factors of 10 between the three nations. Ford executives are seeing this and freaking out. Not sure why Ford is scared. They’re been making high quality robots for decades, they just keep putting them in management. Perhaps if they made them for the factory floor their vehicles would be better built…
I’ve been having the same problem, changing the .is domain to .li usually works out. The piece is pretty interesting, especially how there are essentially workerless factories in China to the point they don’t even keep the lights on.
There’s a few in the US. The Moderna vaccine factory is dark with staff of five technicians.
There is a Chinese joke. A factory of the future will have a dog and a man. The man will ensure the machines are fed materials, and the dog will bite the man if he tries to touch the machines.
…They’re been making high quality robots for decades, they just keep putting them in management.…
I think the have had a number of crash dummies mixed in there.
chris: Ford executives are seeing this and freaking out.
A common diagnosis of third world countries’ failure to develop — principally in Africa and S. America — used to be that they were in the state they were in because their wealthy elites kept on feeding any wealth that emerged or entered those countries into their own bank accounts, further enriching themselves and impoverishing the population as a whole
Same now with much of the the West: there’s been a failure to invest and the default move has been to further enrich shareholders and top executives at every opportunity. 
Neoliberalism provided an ideological framework — however threadbare– for that to happen. And now not only can the West not build high-speed rails and infrastructure, nor fight and win prolonged wars, but in the US — the disease’s epicenter — there’ve been Boeing airliners that fall out of the sky, an F35 fighter force that mostly can’t fly, Polaris missiles sold to foreign states that don’t work, productive capabilities moved overseas, etc. etc.
Ahso, the profit motive is our undoing. If only humanity could see each of us, each other, on a basis of equality.

Will we be swimming in 80-degree water off the coast of Jersey in December?  Lake Superior as the new tropical destination?
In July of 2023 in Manatee Bay Florida, the temp was 101 degrees-rendering the ocean a hot spring of sorts.

“The Best Medicine For Joint Pain Isn’t What You Think, Expert Says”
I’d agree that movement it probably the best thing from a preventative perspective, but in the entire article I didn’t find yoga or stretching mentioned once.  Those are the types of movements you need for ensuring your joints aren’t grinding against each other.
Additionally, arthritis is a disease of inflammation and inflammation is an immune system response.  Having sub-optimal vit D levels can allow your immune system to get out of kilter.  Vit D is important in regulating your inflammatory response mechanisms.  And as we age our body’s ability to make vit D declines significantly and most of us don’t get enough regular exposure to the sun anymore so most of us are sub optimal in our vit D levels even though we haven’t yet got rickets.
Solid vit D levels are also good contra Covid. Over the last few years while studying how to respond to or prevent Covid, lots has been learned. Vit D acts as a hormone in some aspects. Really interesting and inexpensive. Not promoted by any government agency of course.
A few years ago, there were some articles about how stretching had never been formally studied.  People did it because it seemed right and /or they had always done it. 
Research has since found that only tangible benefit was that it made one good at stretching. No evidence it improved performance or reduced injury. I never looked at the studies, and was a bit skeptical since it seemed like there were suddenly many articles about this.
On the other hand, when i was young we stretched, often bounced, when warming up, then they got rid of the bouncing, then they said it was better when cooling down so it doesn’t surprise me that maybe some are saying don’t bother. Maybe I’m just biased because I have never been very flexible – which i also read was a positive indication for arteriosclerosis, but so far, so good.
My 83 year old father discovered Yoga about 10 years ago.  Living on a rural property and having gardening/yard work as a hobby kept him in pretty good shape overall ftom a strength and stamina perspective, but he was stiff as a board.  After doing yoga for 10 years, his flexibility and balance greatly improved. He boasts that he is the only person his age that he knows that can bend down and tie his own shoes.
tai chi…including my homegrown variety…is even lower impact.
my biggest issue is all of my joints, below my jaw(ie. literally all of them,lol…skull sutures dont count).
i am stiff AF when i awake…and am usually awakened by the self-healed compression fractures in my thoracic spine(carrying feed sacks and hay bales)….i describe it to ppl as “i wake up under a fallen stone wall every day…”
stretching, in whatever gentle form i can manage, is essential to getting anything done.
takes me 5-10 minutes of this, sitting on the edge of the bed, before i can get up and make coffee.
much of that, is due to left ankle(1# of stainless steel) becoming disarticulated during the night…hafta “pop” it all back together.
i watched a lotta vids and actually tried real, formal Tai Chi…decades ago…because it was obvious that it could be helpful.
but i found that i was too much of a fall risk with all that,lol…and thence modified the principles intoto my own thing.
these methods have helped…even as they evolved to include the Bar Stump.
i dont get tangled in my own feet near as often as i used to…altho i hafta be careful when i’m in a tight spot with a chainsaw…because i cannot just spring away out of danger like my boys can.

its a matter of comprehending how to stretch and why.  and using the appropriate style for the required application.
stretching is effectively putting a muscle into a state of contraction and stress. Like a rubber band.  Not saying this is a bad thing,  but it needs to be applied usefully. 
one of my teachers said mobilising the joints provided more benefits than stretching according to sports science
nerve complexs occur at the joints.
limber up the joints with slow rotations in both directions
check out Christopher Sommer,  US olympic gymnastics coach.  he  has an online program available which rocks.
 Tim Ferris has two separate interviews with him on his podcast,  with transcripts.  he explains the difference between mobilising and stretching.  and what strength means,  and  how to be strong.  Funny stories about hosting a class for pro bodybuilders,  and  how they failed his warm up. Rolling around on floor in agony.  He  looks at his assistant and says they failed warmup?!  What are we going to do now?

It does not look too bad as a suite.  It took  me a good 5 minutes to download and install the free version on Ubuntu.  I don’t have any Word files available but it opened an 18.8MG,  3-sheet .xlsx file in roughly 5 seconds.
Regarding “Western executives who visit China are coming back terrified,” when I was a member of the national board of directors of the American Institute of Architects, our president-elect returned from a trip to China and reported that the Chinese executives he had met had basically told him that China would be eating America’s lunch and there was nothing we could do about it. The year was 2003.
Wasn’t really hard to work out though I missed it myself. China spent their money on infrastructure, training and development. America decided to spend their money in the sandboxes of Iraq and Afghanistan so that some insiders could become newly minted billionaires.
Yes, the Mandate of Heaven falls on those who raise the least as well as the best, something almost Christian about that (Gibbon of course called Christianity Communism).
In doing so, it turns out you are able to optimize a workforce for climbing the value chain including such valuables NeoLiberalism fails to recognize like transportation, housing, health, education and diet.
Once you’ve got all that in order, you can build the stands around a Capitalist pitch and watch the players compete on a level field. Not to say China has it all worked out on the micro-scale, lots of challenges with over a billion souls, but they’re certainly running a tighter authoritarian ship than we are, and one that’s not leaking from every seam as ours is.

The amount of Consumer Portfolio Services’ outstanding loans that ended up in repossession more than doubled since 2022, to nearly $98 million, in the second quarter of this year.

Cobalt
While the majority of US battery OEM’s still use NMC, China has almost completely changed to LFP.
The power, energy,weight of LFP vs NMC has gotten to where it’s almost the same. But the price is substantially lower and safety is much higher as well as much better for the environment. 
Now of course sodium is the where CATL and BYD are putting most of their money on. Already it’s being used in cars, and energy storage systems. It’s substantially less expensive than LFP and safer yet and a more environmentally sustainable yet. 
Anyone still talking about shortages of lithium and cobalt etc isn’t keeping up with the extremely fast moving battery industry. Which is going to LFP and sodium partially because the raw materials are so much easier to get.
Yves, you are 100% right about joint pain! When I talked to a surgeon about getting a new knee, I mentioned I used to do a lot of sports, he just nodded, and said ‘that will do, it!’  Anyone who advises exercise as a ‘cure’ for arthritis never had a sore joint themselves.

This is what i have noticed about the Trump regime. That will announce all these grandiose plans but there is never any carry through.

That was how the US was able to place men on the Moon in only several years back in the 60s. Now? There seems to be no understanding of this approach or willingness to do the hard work to do it.

Google Translate of Medvedev Telegram post responding to Trump’s Tomahawk musings.
Trump said that if the Russian President doesn’t resolve the Ukrainian conflict, “it will end badly for him.” He’s making this threat for the hundred and first time, in short.
If “business peacemaker” is referring to Tomahawks, the phrase is incorrect. The delivery of these missiles could end badly for everyone. And most of all, for Trump himself.
It’s been said a hundred times, in a manner understandable even to the star-spangled man, that it’s impossible to distinguish a nuclear Tomahawk from a conventional one in flight. It won’t be Bandera’s Kyiv that launches them, but the United States. Read: Trump. How to respond to Russia? Exactly!
One can only hope that this is another empty threat, prompted by protracted negotiations with a cocaine-addled clown. Like sending nuclear submarines closer to Russia. Well, you know how it happens: a submarine surfaced in the steppes of Ukraine.
There hasn’t been a nuclear Tomahawk for 20+ years; not sure what the concern is about?

Essences are not fungible, which is what numeric or abstract systems require: what is lost, over time builds into what is essential, simply for having been lost for so long.
Yes! Robert Reich prophesied thirty years ago that the symbolic analysts would be the ones in demand in business, with the secure, high paid jobs. And so it came to pass.
But extracting patterns and the like, now on steroids with AI, is only as good as what is chosen as the inputs, what is chosen as “data”, and what is discarded as “noise”.
Beauty and love and integrity and angst have been discarded while we capture data about “facts”.
The world has descended into chaos since we all became much more efficient at data collection and interpretation.
“Trio win Nobel economics prize for work on innovation, growth and ‘creative destruction'”
There is a video at the top of this page and it looks like one of these turkeys giving a speech though he sounds like a flim flam man. At one point he says-
 ‘I strongly urge the world to keep putting efforts and money and resources and incentives to the people who are trying to invent us out of these two crisis.’
Yep, he’s a modern economist, okay. The world has major problem? Give some billions to a billionaire to try to figure out an answer though likely they were partly responsible for the problems in the first place.
Maybe we can assuage all grown up now Anthony Fremont by  awarding him a ‘Consolation Nobel Prize’ with said medal having a likeness of both the King of Sweden and Donald Trump in a conjoined design of things?
The Arnaud Bertrand article about China delaying using the rare earth card until today because it had to ensure a source of helium independent of the USA is very interesting. However, I am surprised he did not make another couple of connections. 
First, in the early days of the SMO in the Ukraine, one of the many valuable Ukrainian industries we were asked to safeguard for the USA was… the extensive noble gas production business in the Donbas. Neon, krypton and xenon are all produced as a by-product of the steel industry liquifying and seperating air for oxygen production. The Ukraine accounted for well over half of the neon market and getting on for half of the krypton and xenon markets. The noble gases are needed in semiconductors, lasers, etc. 
Second, the second biggest supplier of helium after the USA is… Qatar. I imagine the US security guarantee is driven as much by the desire to prevent Qatar accepting others’ guarantees as it is by US interests (the US has plenty of natural gas and helium).
I appreciate the consistent coverage of the H2a program here at NC. Hard to find elsewhere. Recent “downward adjustments” have played out in line with much of the commentary I have read from Conor and others here at NC. Sad and scary for me and those I work with, but vital. Keep up the good work!
Any chance of something on the Jamaican H2a program popular here in the North East US?
China and Helium. 
This piece also answers the question of why the German dirigible Hindenburg was filled with hydrogen gas instead of non-flammable helium. 
Helium was a strategic material during World War II, with the vast majority of the world supplies held by the United States. When the Germans needed a lighter than air gas they were forced to use hydrogen with the explosive results we saw. 
Looks like not that much has changed until very recently, with China developing new technologies for industrial helium manufacture.

“Lebanon • Private US military consultants flock to bolster Lebanese military”
‘The Pentagon has pledged an additional $230m in military aid to Beirut, stepping up US support for the Lebanese military and intelligence services in their ambitions to disarm Hezbollah. Cooperation is centred on a team of consultants funded by the US Department of Defense, as well as the British and Canadian governments.’
 So the Pentagon wants to give the Lebanese army enough equipment to fight a civil war with Hezbollah but not enough so that Israel has a sad face. And what Lebanon seriously needs right now is a civil war. With all these consultants, anybody think they will do just a good a job as they did for the Ukraine?

Cryptocurrency markets having a sad couple days, well it’s a damn shame isn’t that.  \sarc
Have those market participants in those varied Coins and exchanges not watched films such as Trading Places, or Wall Street, like ever at all?  During 2025, been a good bit of “perpetually bullish” talk on the valuation of cryptocurrency like Bitcoin; but in the end of a tumultuous trading session it looks a lot like the fictional Duke brothers complaining about the margin call and their firm’s seats going up for resale.

But now it’s like a shiny turd…”
Process knowledge is crucial to economic development – Programmable Mutter
“If Dan is right, you need deep connections into the physical economy to make proper use of the virtual economy that America is over-specialized in. If you don’t understand and work in the real world, you won’t have the kind of feedback loops that enable you to see how the economy works.”
Indeed.  I remember my years working at a record label in the 90s.  I was a regional sales manager, but the big boss made sure we were educated in the economy of it all.  We had to visit record stores, wholesalers, radio stations, CD and vinyl manufacturing plants (all in the USA at that time), recording studios, music festivals and concerts, the sales conferences, music video shoots, and the mail distribution centers.  It was my first introduction to the open room workplace.  The sales people were sat between the radio promotion team and manufacturing team.
One of the first things he warned us about was that a hit record could be a company’s demise and not a launch pad – if the process was not understood.
AI rally fuelled by junk debt as crash fears grow Telegraph
Meanwhile, in AI news:
O “Concerns around an AI bubble have been growing amid unease that a surge in valuations has not been justified by consumers’ appetite for the technology.”
O “Growing numbers of businesses are cancelling their subscriptions to AI apps amid concerns that heavy spending on chatbots is leading to a surge in so-called “workslop” – low-quality work churned out by employees who are overly reliant on AI chatbots.”
O ” …despite soaring investment and increased efforts from executives to coax staff into adopting the tools, most corporate AI projects have failed to make money.  In August, a study from MIT found 95pc of company AI projects had so far generated zero return on investment.”
Nothing to see here!

It seems that more and more mainstream economists are calling AI a bubble:
https://seekingalpha.com/news/4503973-the-third-bubble-of-our-century-could-be-near
Does anyone recall the timeline for the 2008 housing bubble finally popping?  I seem to recall that while housing was widely recognized as a bubble as early as 2004/5, it wasn’t until 2007 when the writing was on the wall.  The homebuilders started imploding first, then we had the first hedge funds go under, Thornburg Mortgage blew up, and finally Countrywide imploded.  That was the first act.  The second act was 2008, when it became apparent that it wasn’t “contained” to just homebuilders and subprime mortgage bucket shops.
(Let us also have a moment of silence for Cramer’s famous meltdown on CNBC in August of 2007.) 
I want to say that every reputable economist recognized housing as a bubble by early 2007, and that subprime wasn’t contained, yet the music kept playing for a few more quarters.  I would wager that we’re roughly at the equivalent of fall 2006 right now.  Some smaller AI companies have imploded, but no “Big Kahuna” yet.  We haven’t even had our Thornburg mortgage equivalent … that might be Anthropic or a smaller AI player going bankrupt.
(I presume Nvidia is the Big Kahuna. If/when it blows, the name of the game will be to find out the dependencies, i.e. homebuilders->big banks->AIG)
We need our Bear Stearns!
I think it was 2010 sometime, but I could be off a little, I was in Columbus, Ohio at a sports bar with a bunch of guys who worked for JP Morgan Chase. Apparently, JPM has a large footprint in Columbus. Anyway, we were talking about the crash and the bank earnings, which JP Morgan had reported that week. The only reason the stock price didn’t get hammered more was their loan loss reserves or something like that, but that isn’t my point.
As I was talking to these guys I learned they were loan officers and one was a senior loan officer. He said “I can’t count the number of loans I approved that I knew would never pay them back.” WHAT? So, like a dummy, I said “if you knew all these loans were not going to be paid back, why did you and the bank approve them?”
Seems like a good question, no? So he calmly looks at me and says “because the government said we had to.” WHAT? Is that true? I guess/assume the government set the rules for who qualified, and who didn’t. Maybe, I don’t know.
Sure seems to me, if I owned a bank or loaning institution, I sure wouldn’t approve loans I knew would never be paid back. But that’s just me. That entire exchange I will never forget, and never make sense out of.
The rest, as they say, is history.
This goes back to conservatives blaming the Community Reinvestment Act (1977) for forcing banks to lend to unworthy borrowers. This is an article of faith for them.
The Federal Reserve debunked this. (This is in 2023, but it didn’t take 15 years to debunk this.)
Concerns have lingered since the 2007 subprime crisis that government housing policies
promote risky mortgage lending. The first peer-reviewed evidence of a causal effect was
published by the Review of Financial Studies in a paper (Saadi, 2020) linking the crisis
to changes in the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) in 1995. A review of that paper,
however, shows that it misrepresents the policy changes as having taken effect in mid-1998,
2.5 years after they were implemented. When the correct timing is used, a similar analysis
yields no evidence of a relationship between CRA and riskier mortgage lending. Instead,
the results are shown to reflect an unrelated confounding event, the first collapse of the
U.S. subprime mortgage market following Russia’s debt default in August 1998.
For example, see this from the Minneapolis Fed in 2009:
Did the CRA cause the mortgage market meltdown?
As the current financial crisis has unfolded, an argument that the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) is at its root has gained a foothold. This argument draws on the fact that the CRA encourages commercial banks and savings institutions (collectively known as banking institutions) to help meet the credit needs of lower-income borrowers and borrowers in lower-income neighborhoods.1/ Critics of the CRA contend that the law pushed banking institutions to undertake high-risk mortgage lending.
This article discusses key features of the CRA and presents results from our analysis of several data sources regarding the volume and performance of CRA-related mortgage lending. On balance, the evidence runs counter to the contention that the CRA lies at the root of the current mortgage crisis.
Nonetheless conservatives will cling to lending to low income, ostensibly by legal force, as the culprit, a circle that cannot be squared.
The analog, I suppose, to bad loans circa 2007 as compared with current times is VC and big tech money being lent to speculative ventures like OpenAI that, in the hindsight of 2030, will be seen as obvious that it could never be paid back.
My working theory is that:  1. Smaller speculative AI companies with no monetize-able use cases blow up first (1), then nVidia’s customers (datacenter jockeys dependent on the losers in step 1) blow up (2), then (3) nVidia blows up.
An alternate theory is that OpenAI is the “Big Kahuna” but the dependency/tight coupling between them and nVidia makes me think that if one goes down, the other will follow.  Also, OpenAI is still not public and technically not a for-profit venture, so how that all plays out is hard to predict.
We haven’t made it to step 1, yet, as there is still VC money flooding into these malinvestments.  Big Tech is the equivalent to the 2008 era Big Banks – JPMorgan, Bank of America, etc.  Note that most of them survived due to government bailouts, but their stock prices suffered greatly.  I expect a similar outcome for Microsoft, Facebook, and Google – the companies will survive but the stocks will go into stage 4 declines.
BTW, by 2010 we were in the post-crisis phase of the housing bust/financial crisis.  The Fed was in full damage control QE mode by then, and the stock market had already bottomed out.
I was getting the itchiest of feet regarding my stock holdings, which were annual gifts from my parents (a great way to go about inheritances without waiting for the corpus delecti-I think its up to $18k tax free gift per annum now) and pulled the trigger in early 2007, and the one i’ll really remember is Fannie Mae, sold it @ $59, and it was under a buck for eons-imagine taking a 98% haircut. For some reason its now over $10 a share.
Joel Mokyr, not the worst pick we have seen for the “Nobel” prize in economics.  More a historian than a chalkboard fantasist, his work on capitalist innovation would dovetail nicely with what Marx and Engels wrote in The Communist Manifesto if he showed more interest in the problem of distribution than the rest of his  tribe,  all happily thumping  the table and shouting  “Progress!” The world is going to hell, but hey,  long distance phone calls are free now and that lemon you’re driving beats a 1974 Ford Pinto hands down for safety and comfort.  But I have found Mokyr’s work to be generally open-minded and rigorous.  In a debate back in the 1980s on the timing and speed of growth and distribution during the British industrial revolution he identified the rate of profit as a pivotal variable, “a historical fact recognised equally by Marx and W.A. Lewis” and actually suggested that “it is possible that the increase in real wages is overblown  and the growth of modern industry in Britain can be approximated after all by the parables of capitalist dynamics first proposed by Marx.”  And in a innovative though inconclusive study investigating  “Why Ireland Starved” he argued that “when the chips were down in the frightful summer of 1847, the British simply abandoned the Irish and let them perish.  There is no doubt that Britain could have saved Ireland. The British treasury spent a total of about £9.5 million of famine relief. . . A few years after the famine, the British government spent £69.3 million on an utterly futile venture in the Crimea. Half that sum spent in Ireland in the critical years 1846-9 would have saved hundreds of thousands of lives.  It is difficult to reconcile this lavishness with claims [by two Irish revisionist historians] that British relief during the famine years was inadequate because the problem was ‘too huge for the British state to overcome.’”

Great fun and a pleasure to hear and read  Here’s a link to the CSIS article: https://www.csis.org/analysis/consequences-chinas-new-rare-earths-export-restrictions.  It really costs an impressive amount to create, develop and maintain US military and intelligence establishments that are so useless.  My dad fought alongside Americans in North Africa, Sicily and Italy and said they were a helluva killing machine, so it was best to be on the other side if you had any inclination to maximise your personal safety.
I just watched a video from the Center for American Progress on making the Citizens Unted (CU) decision irrelevant and am introducing the topic for the commentariat’s consideration. In brief, CU is a US Supreme Court decision holding that government may not regulate a corporation’s right to spend money independently in elections. This is not, however, an inherent right, but is derived from the power granted by state corporate law to a corporation to exercise the same powers as an individual. Corporations are pure creatures of law and have zero powers until a government grants them some. If the state does not grant the power of a corporation to exercise political speech, corporate political spending is ultra vires and void, and so the first amendment right could no longer attach, as there would be nothing to attach it to. In Montana, a group is creating an initiative to put on the ballot a Montana constitutional amendment taking away the power in the corporate charter of political spending by a corporation. If this passes, no corporation (including a nonprofit corporation) could engage in political spending in any election in Montana. Note that this would apply not just to a Montana corporation, but to any corporation no matter its state of incorporation, since corporate law is state specific and any ‘foreign’ (to Montana) corporation could not exercise a power that is ultra vires in Montana . This would prohibit the unlimited 501(c)(4) super PAC and anonymous dark money from spending on any election in a state that did not grant that power to a corporate entity.

Israel limits aid into Gaza in dispute over hostage remains as ceasefire faces test (Guardian)

The fragile ceasefire in Gaza faced its first test on Tuesday when Israel said the flow of aid into the devastated Palestinian territory would be cut by half and the crucial Rafah border crossing with Egypt would not open as planned, blaming Hamas for delays in the return of bodies of hostages.
The militant group handed over the remains of four hostages to the International Committee of the Red Cross on Tuesday night, bringing to eight the number of bodies transferred since the US-brokered ceasefire took hold, leaving 20 to be accounted for. Hamas said it was facing obstacles as not all the burial sites had been identified.
The Red Cross, which is overseeing the transfer of remains, warned on Monday that the retrieval was a “massive challenge” given the difficulties of finding bodies in Gaza’s rubble, and could take days or weeks.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration has revoked the visas of six foreigners deemed by U.S. officials to have made derisive comments or made light of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk last month.
The State Department said Tuesday it had determined they should lose their visas after reviewing their online social media posts and clips about Kirk, who was killed while speaking at a Utah college campus on Sept. 10.
The six foreigners who had their visas revoked were from Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Mexico, Paraguay and South Africa. They were not identified.
Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio “will defend our borders, our culture, and our citizens by enforcing our immigration laws,” the State Department said. “Aliens who take advantage of America’s hospitality while celebrating the assassination of our citizens will be removed.”
Vice President JD Vance and other top U.S. officials have encouraged people to call out offensive language about Kirk that they see online. In an unusual tweet last month, Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau asked social media users to copy him on any relevant posts, saying he was personally “disgusted to see some on social media praising, rationalizing, or making light of the event, and have directed our consular officials to undertake appropriate action.” (Huntington Post)

You were probably told from a young age that if you’re a loyal, hard worker, your efforts will surely be rewarded. You’ll be given promotions, raises and the respect of your employer. And you’ll never have to worry about job security! Unfortunately, however, that does not reflect the current job market. And the days of working for the same company for decades are long gone, as companies have proven time and time again that they don’t value their loyal workers.

One woman who learned this lesson the hard way recently reached out to Reddit to share her story. Below, you’ll find all of the details about why she refuses to train her replacement, as well as some of the replies invested readers shared.

The idea of paying a new hire more than someone who’s been at the company for years sounds absurd. Shouldn’t the seasoned veteran be rewarded for their dedication? Well, unfortunately, companies don’t always see it that way. There’s a reason why many experts recommend changing jobs every three to five years. 
Raises aren’t always guaranteed, even if you’re loyal to a company for many years. In fact, a Monster survey found that over a quarter of workers haven’t received a raise in over a year, and 18% of workers polled had never received a raise. Meanwhile, Resume Worded reports that job switchers tend to see between a 5% and 15% salary increase when they start a new position.
So why are new hires being paid more? Well, Bloomberry says there are a few explanations. First of all, your employer might actually want you to leave. Some Big Tech companies even fire the bottom 10% of their workforce every year to make room for more skilled employees. By refusing to give you a raise, your company might be nudging you towards the door.
Another potential explanation is that the company might have a capped budget for salary raises. But their hiring budget might be even larger. At the same time, HR often doesn’t realize the long-term impacts that come along with paying new hires more than the people they’re replacing. It might make sense on paper, but the loss of experience and skill can come back to bite them.
There’s also a common misconception that experience collected at other companies is somehow more valuable than experience garnered in house. New hires are attractive to companies because they bring unique perspectives to the table, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that they’ll be a good fit.

While employers are prioritizing attracting new talent, Harvard Business Review warns that paying replacements more is a great way to get top performers to resign. When workers realize that they’re not being valued, they’ll start seeking out new opportunities. After all, nobody wants to miss out on a higher salary if they might be able to find one elsewhere.
Of course, this can also take a huge toll on morale within a company. Veterans might be bitter about new hires earning more than them, and as more tenured employees begin to jump ship, the company loses out on valuable expertise. Plus, if everyone in the office is a relatively new hire, they might not have the necessary skills and knowledge to keep the company afloat. 
There are steps companies can take to prevent these issues from arising, though. Hppy recommends carrying out regular payroll audits to ensure that employees are being paid fairly. It’s also a good idea to have open conversations about pay structure. 
Employees should understand exactly why they’re earning their current salary. Meanwhile, adjustments should be made when necessary. And workers should feel comfortable expressing any concerns they may have about their wages. It’s better to address these issues than to suffer in silence, especially if someone with 5 years less experience is out-earning you. 
We would love to hear your thoughts on this situation in the comments below, pandas. Do you think this woman made the right call by refusing to train her replacement? Then, if you’re looking for another Bored Panda article discussing similar workplace drama, look no further than right here.

 Howdy, I'm Adelaide! I'm originally from Texas, but after graduating from university with an acting degree, I relocated to sunny Los Angeles for a while. I then got a serious bite from the travel bug and found myself moving to Sweden and England before settling in Lithuania about three years ago. I'm passionate about animal welfare, sustainability and eating delicious food. But as you can see, I cover a wide range of topics including drama, internet trends and hilarious memes. I can easily be won over with a Seinfeld reference, vegan pastry or glass of fresh cold brew. And during my free time, I can usually be seen strolling through a park, playing tennis or baking something tasty.

See folks? THIS is why employers have tried to gaslight employees into thinking it was against the rules to discuss salary. I even had one past employer years ago try to make their employees sign a f*****g contract stating that we would not discuss salary with other employees—-ILLEGAL! By LAW we can discuss our salaries with anybody we d****d well please, including our fellow employees. That way, management can’t hide paying someone they favor more than their cohorts (for varying reasons, mostly because they’re family, friends, or side pieces, rarely because they’re better, more talented, educated, or qualified—-in fact they’re usually total s**t at the job). Knowing your rights when it comes to work is a valuable thing, and can help keep you from being cheated.
And it took time and effort to get here - I remember getting tossed from a job in the '80s for mentioning salary. Not DISCUSSING it - MENTIONING it.
This happened to my daughter (UK). She's an Accountant. Her bosses 'encouraged' employees not to talk about salaries (red flag there), but back then she was newly qualified. Five years on, having average % increments yearly as she rose slowly higher - ""We're a small company"" excuses (it wasn't that small). A young bloke, fresh from AAT College, was hired in the section she supervised, and was asked to train him up to spec. The salary discrepancy, came out the same way as this story. He was earning £5,000 pa more than her. One of her Account clients, that she'd become friendly with over the years, offered her a direct job offer after she disclosed it. She got £12,000 more p.a. - which was about right for her level over the Pond, and good raises p.a./skill levels. Glad the OP moved onto better prospects. NTA.
It's illegal in the UK to prevent employees from discussing salaries. It's covered under the equality laws.
It's also illegal in the USA (and I'd wager in a lot of other countries), but there's also a difference between discouraging and preventing. A lot also depends on how they discourage such talks.
I'm going through something similar. I came into accompany the only designer. I was working like crazy with a mountain on my to-do list. Wanted a raise but was told the company was bleeding money. A month later they hired another designer and paid him $40k more than me. I was upset but at least I finally had some help right? NOPE. They gave him the only project on my plate I was actually looking forward to doing and had been told would be my project from the time I was hiring. They wanted him to be allowed to ""focus"" so he was given barely anything to do, Held to no accountability standard, And had zero transparency for the result week over week of his supposed 40 hours of time. I'm still sour about it
Want to add that I had myself convinced he must be a much better designer. Now that he's been with the company for several months and I've seen his work, I honestly have no idea why they keep this guy except he has a personal prior friendship with our director.

Achieving the global temperature targets set in the Paris climate agreement requires deep, rapid cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions, and therefore the swift phase-out of fossil fuels. Many factors stand in the way. One of the most pernicious is carbon offsets.
Offsets are tradable credits from projects that claim to reduce emissions, either by avoiding them or by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Businesses and countries trade these credits — each representing the equivalent of one tonne of CO2 — to ‘neutralize’ their own emissions.
Net zero needs AI — five actions to realize its promise
Net zero needs AI — five actions to realize its promise
Although conceptually appealing, this reliance on offsets has fatal flaws. In practice, it’s difficult to ensure that they represent real emissions reductions rather than ‘hot air’, with the claimed climate benefits existing only on paper. Equally challenging is ensuring that emission reductions are ‘additional’, meaning that they would not have occurred without the incentive provided by the sale of carbon credits. For projects credited for sequestering carbon, it is also crucial to ensure that the CO2 is locked away permanently and not released back into the atmosphere later.
Most carbon-offset schemes fall foul of one or more of these requirements. Thus, offsets undermine decarbonization by enabling companies and countries to claim that emissions have been reduced when they have not. This results in more emissions, delays the phase-out of fossil fuels and diverts scarce resources to false solutions.
Yet, climate-policy processes continue to rely on them. The operationalization of Article 6 of the Paris agreement and full implementation of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, both achieved in 2024, are set to turbocharge demand for carbon credits. In parallel, voluntary carbon markets are promising to raise standards as a way of further legitimizing and scaling up offsets.
Of greatest concern is the expanding role of offsets in domestic carbon-pricing schemes, such as emissions trading and carbon taxes. Although the European Union’s Emissions Trading System phased out offsets in 2020, they still feature in most major carbon-pricing schemes outside Europe, including in China, Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Singapore, California, Canada and Australia. They are even permitted as a substitute for paying carbon taxes in countries such as South Africa, Mexico, Chile and Colombia.
Such practices threaten to undermine global decarbonization efforts. Low-quality offsets artificially depress carbon prices, which dilutes the incentive for industries to cut their emissions and weakens the effectiveness of carbon-pricing schemes.
Here, we outline the problems and call on decision makers to exclude offsets from carbon-pricing schemes.
Carbon offsetting sounds simple on paper. In practice, it is anything but.
It is extremely difficult to evaluate the emission reductions achieved by offset projects because calculations require comparing outcomes with ‘business-as-usual’ projections. For example, calculating the climate benefits from a project that avoids deforestation involves comparing a forest’s actual carbon stock to that in a counterfactual scenario in which the project did not happen. The hypothetical nature of such calculations invites manipulation and can tempt project developers to overestimate business-as-usual emissions to generate more credits.

Heatwaves linked to carbon emissions from specific companies
Fundamental imbalances in the information used in offset schemes leave them vulnerable to these outcomes. In most cases, only project leaders and developers know whether their projects are dependent on credit revenues and are therefore truly additional. This makes it difficult for administrators to screen out shoddy projects.
Even where projects are additional, errors can arise from inaccurate measurement of emissions and carbon stocks. These risks are most acute when the sources and sinks are variable. For example, stocks of soil organic carbon vary naturally across landscapes and through time. This is a product of diversity in soil characteristics, topography and vegetation cover, as well as in seasonal, annual and decadal changes in temperatures and rainfall. The variability makes it difficult to accurately measure changes in the carbon stock and ensure that the credited carbon storage is fully attributable to the project1.
It is also difficult to ensure that credited carbon removals remain sequestered. Many carbon sinks are susceptible to natural disturbances, such as droughts and wildfires, which can release carbon stored in trees and soils. Carbon stocks can also be lost through the clearing of vegetation and other changes in land-management practices. Despite these risks, most offset schemes mandate that credited sinks be maintained for only 40 years or even less. Given that CO2 emissions require thousands of years to be reabsorbed by Earth’s climate system2, credited removals need to lock away carbon for a similar period to genuinely neutralize the warming caused by the emissions that are claimed to be offset.
In most markets, the risks associated with the supply of low-quality goods and services can be alleviated if consumers are able to judge quality and seek redress when standards are not met. With offsets, however, the complexity and a lack of transparency make it close to impossible for buyers to make informed decisions about the quality of most credits. Moreover, many buyers are not incentivized to care. Typically, their priority is to procure credits at the lowest possible cost, a fact evidenced by a 2024 study revealing that the largest corporate buyers consistently choose low-priced credits over higher-quality alternatives3.
Why the green-technology race might not save the planet
Why the green-technology race might not save the planet
For these reasons, the integrity of offset schemes hinges on the skills and efforts of administrators, but they are often incentivized to prioritize supply over integrity. In voluntary offset markets, registries rely on project registrations and credit issuances for revenue, while competing with one another for market share. Tightening integrity standards can therefore reduce revenue and put this business model at risk.
Government-regulated offset programmes linked to carbon-pricing schemes show a similar dynamic. The main reason that pricing schemes allow the use of offsets is to lower compliance costs for polluters, thereby reducing resistance to climate policies4. Yet the focus on cost reduction places pressure on regulators to ensure a plentiful supply of low-cost credits, frequently at the expense of environmental integrity.
These interlinked issues make integrity failings inevitable. The science reflects this, with studies repeatedly showing that few of the major offset types in use today deliver real, additional or permanent abatement. A 2024 meta-analysis examining some 2,300 offset projects — amounting to around one-fifth of all issued credits — found that less than 16% achieved the emissions reductions claimed by developers5. In-depth evaluations of avoided deforestation6, renewable energy7 and clean cooking-stove projects8 have also exposed persistent problems with additionality, inaccurate measurement and impermanence.
Recognizing these flaws, some stakeholders advocate a shift from projects that avoid emissions to those that remove carbon from the atmosphere. However, carbon-removal projects tend to have similar integrity problems. Engineering-based techniques are scarce, and so most removal projects currently involve less durable nature-based approaches, such as tree planting, improved soil management and production of biochar (plant-derived charcoal). And just as with emissions-avoidance projects, studies reveal persistent integrity failings, particularly regarding the crediting of non-existent and non-additional removals9,10.
Bad offsets cheat the climate by failing to deliver their promised emission reductions. And they do further damage by distorting carbon-pricing schemes.
Six roadblocks to net zero — and how to get around them
Six roadblocks to net zero — and how to get around them
In a well-functioning emissions trading scheme, the carbon price will reflect the marginal cost of reducing emissions, whether at a polluting facility or through an offset project. When offsets lack integrity, credit prices reflect the cost of supplying pretend, rather than real, emission reductions, which artificially lowers the carbon price. The same is true for carbon taxes: low-integrity credits reduce the carbon price faced by polluters by allowing them to surrender cheap credits in place of paying the tax.

93,2025-10-14,"Google's parent company Alphabet will invest $15bn (£11.29bn) to build an AI data hub in southern India's Andhra Pradesh state.
The facility, which will be set up in the port city of Visakhapatnam, will be part of Google's global network of AI centres spread across 12 countries.
""It's the largest AI hub that we are going to be investing in anywhere in the world, outside of the United States,"" Thomas Kurian, the CEO of Google Cloud, said at an event in the capital Delhi on Tuesday, adding that the investment will be spread over the next five years.
The announcement comes at a time when US President Donald Trump has been asking American companies to prioritise domestic investment.
India has emerged as a key destination for AI data centres. The country's low data costs and rapidly growing internet user base have made it a hub for cloud and AI expansion for tech giants.
Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said the facility ""will bring our industry-leading technology to enterprises and users in India, accelerating AI innovation and driving growth across the country"".
A formal agreement to finalise the project will be signed on Tuesday, the Andhra Pradesh government said.
""It is a massive leap for our state's digital future, innovation, and global standing,"" said the state's technology minister Nara Lokesh.
The project will combine cloud and AI infrastructure with renewable energy systems and an expanded fibre-optic network.
The project is part of the Andhra Pradesh government's plan to develop 6GW of data centre capacity by 2029, according to Bloomberg News. 
Data centres are physical facilities that house the computing and networking equipment that organisations use to collect, process, store, and distribute data. 
They contain servers, storage systems and network equipment like routers and firewalls, along with the necessary power and cooling systems to operate them.
In Andhra Pradesh, the government has been offering subsidised land and electricity to attract global investors.
India's data centre industry has grown rapidly over the past five years, crossing the 1GW capacity mark in 2024 and nearly tripling its 2019 level, according to global professional service firm JLL's India Data Centre Market Dynamics 2024 report.

META’s stock has seen a solid 43% rise in the last six months. This growth is primarily fueled by a mix of factors, including upbeat quarterly performance and significant AI investments that boosted the core advertising business, leading to a rise in ad impressions and ad prices.
Furthermore, rising user engagement across its apps contributed to investor optimism, all while the company returned capital to shareholders via $9.76 billion in share repurchases and $1.33 billion in dividend payments in Q2 alone.
From a quantitative perspective, the 43% surge in Meta Platforms stock in the last six months was largely driven by a 33.5% change in the company's P/E Multiple. While there is more to this narrative than mere numbers, let's first dissect the stock price movement into its contributing factors.
Investing in a single stock can be fraught with risk, but there is substantial benefit to a more diversified strategy, like the one we employ with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Additionally, think about the potential long-term performance for your portfolio if you integrated 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto alongside equities. Separately, see – What's Happening With RGTI Stock?
Returning to the “change”: The alterations in fundamental aspects like valuation, revenue, and margins carry with them a narrative related to business and investor sentiment. Below, we have pinpointed significant developments that impacted the stock price movements for META stock. As a quick background: META offers products that allow users to connect and share through various devices, including mobile phones, PCs, VR headsets, wearables, and augmented reality, promoting connectivity anytime and anywhere.
Opinion: Currently, we view META stock as fairly valued. Why is that the case? Take a look at the full narrative. Read Buy or Sell META Stock to understand what informs our current viewpoint.
Risk: Nonetheless, META is not immune to significant declines. It dropped approximately 43% during the 2018 correction, 35% amid the Covid pandemic, and sustained a heavier blow of 77% during the inflation crisis. Despite all the positives surrounding the stock, real risks remain. When markets sour, META can still experience serious downturns.
Consistently selecting winners is a challenging endeavor, particularly given the volatility linked to a single stock. Instead, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a proven record of surpassing the S&P 500 during the past 4-year period. Why is this the case? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; resulting in a steadier performance, as evidenced in HQ Portfolio performance metrics."

MP Materials (NYSE:MP), an American company specializing in rare-earth materials and based in Las Vegas, Nevada, experienced a stock increase of approximately 8% on Friday after China revealed new export restrictions on rare-earth elements. The updated regulations will necessitate that foreign purchasers secure licenses, heightening concerns over supply shortages. In reaction, President Donald Trump threatened more substantial tariffs on Chinese imports and indicated the possibility of canceling his meeting with President Xi, rekindling U.S.-China trade frictions. This situation could provide a significant advantage for MP Materials. With Washington already investing $400 million in the firm and ensuring future purchases, MP stands to gain from any initiative that encourages the U.S. to reduce reliance on Chinese supplies. Investors are currently wagering on increased demand, improved pricing, and ongoing policy support for U.S.-based manufacturers.
MP stock has recently made substantial gains, yet we presently find it unappealing. This could be seen as a warning, and there exists considerable risk in depending on a single stock. Nonetheless, there is immense value to the broader diversified strategy we adopt with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Additionally, contemplate what the long-term performance of your portfolio could resemble if you integrated 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto along with equities.
Geopolitical changes have only heightened the significance of this role. Earlier this year, after Washington enacted higher tariffs on Chinese goods, Beijing implemented export controls on rare earths. China's rare earth exports have been severely impacted: in September 2025, exports fell by 31% from August to reach 4,000.3 tonnes, marking the lowest monthly figure since February 2025. Now, China has broadened its rare earth export restrictions to encompass 12 of the 17 rare earth elements, with new regulations set to take effect from December 1. These regulations will mandate licenses for the export of rare earth magnets and related products, including those for foreign companies that utilize Chinese-origin rare earth materials or technologies. These events underscore the necessity for a secure domestic supply.
This positions MP Materials as one of the most strategic companies in America's endeavor to establish its critical minerals supply chain. The firm owns and operates the Mountain Pass Mine in California – currently the only operational rare-earth mine and processing facility in the United States. Its primary focus is on producing Neodymium-Praseodymium (NdPr), critical for high-strength permanent magnets used in EV motors, wind turbines, drones, and defense apparatus. In July, the U.S. Department of Defense became MP’s largest shareholder following a $400 million equity investment aimed at boosting the company’s magnet production capacity. MP also entered into a $500 million supply agreement with Apple, using prepayments to finance much of its new Independence facility in Texas, which will manufacture finished rare-earth magnets.
MP’s operational advancements have been robust. In Q2 2025, the company announced record NdPr oxide production, up 119% year-on-year, with sales volumes tripling to 443 metric tons. Revenue soared 84% to $57.4 million, surpassing expectations. Management anticipates another sequential production increase of 10%–20% in Q3. The company is also progressing downstream — shifting from raw oxide production to high-value magnet alloys and finished magnets, a segment where sales have already reached $20 million last quarter. MP aims to scale this to 10,000 metric tons annually by 2028, which could significantly enhance margins. Financially, MP remains well-capitalized, holding nearly $2 billion in cash, which provides it with the flexibility for expansion and R&D.
Despite its strong fundamentals and policy backing, valuation is a significant concern. MP trades at approximately 50x forward revenue, comparing more closely with high-growth tech companies than with miners. The business is still unprofitable, reporting a $53.5 million net loss and consuming $126 million in cash year-to-date. Although geopolitical tailwinds have driven its rise — the stock has increased over 500% year-to-date — this reliance could work against it. Any easing in trade tensions or normalization in Chinese exports might weaken the bullish perspective. With China producing 90% of the world’s rare-earth magnets, MP’s advantage remains particularly sensitive to policy changes.
The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising a selection of 30 stocks, has a proven history of comfortably surpassing its benchmark that encompasses all three – S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap – achieving returns in excess of 105% since its inception. Why is this the case? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index, resulting in a less volatile experience, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics."

98,2025-10-14,"Yves here. At least for now, market action has confirmed our thesis that even though marked weakening of the dollar is baked in longer term, it would take a long time to play out. BRICS fans have touted the GDP level in the Global South as an indicator of destiny. However, financial markets are dominated by investment flows, not by population or even GDP weight. We have to point out often that the excitement over countries slipping the noose of dollar-system US sanctions by trading bilaterally in their own currencies is not even remotely enough to imperil the dollar. A BIS study found that trade transactions represent about 3% of the value of foreign exchange transactions. Similarly, a recent BIS survey found that the dollar share of foreign exchange transactions had increased since 2022:
Highlights from the 2025 Triennial Survey of turnover in OTC FX markets:
Advanced economies still have much higher GDP per capita. That translates among other things into more funds available for investment.
What is therefore likely to prove detrimental to the dollar, perhaps sooner rather than later, is dollar investments falling out of fashion. The Liberation Day flight from Treasuries produced a corresponding marked fall in the dollar. That has not only been somewhat reversed but a VoxEU study even found that Treasuries have returned, at least for now, to their status as a haven in times of perceived high risk.
Trump is declaring war on the perceived safety of US financial markets with his continued deregulation push and promotion of crypto-scamming. An AI implosion and/or a private debt market freakout could also lead to flight from dollar investments and hence the dollar.
By Wolf Richter, editor at Wolf Street. Originally published at Wolf Street
A hot theme widely banded about to pump up cryptos, gold, silver, and even stocks is the so-called “currency debasement trade.” The idea is that enough traders rally behind a common theme to move prices in their direction for long enough to make a serious buck and generate fees from the trading.
This debasement-trade theme is a bet that government borrowing and money printing will erode the value of the US dollar dramatically and quickly, and that therefore enough investors will pile into cryptos, gold, silver, and even stocks, to cause prices of those instruments to explode. And they did.
But the huge bond market has taken the opposite bet, led by the $29-trillion Treasury market, the $11-trillion corporate bond market, the $9-trillion residential MBS market, the $4-trillion municipal bond market, plus the other segments of the bond market, where yields have fallen this year and have been in the same relatively narrow range for the past three years.
These bond investors bet that inflation will cool further over the longer horizon, and that the relatively low yields they get on their securities will therefore adequately remunerate them for inflation and for the risks they’re taking, and that the cooling of inflation will cause yields to decline further in the future, thereby pushing up prices of bonds that had been issued earlier at higher yields.
If the bond market were fearing a rapid and substantial debasement of the US dollar – the theme being hyped by the debasement trade promoters – it would demand much higher yields. But that hasn’t been the case.
The 10-year Treasury yield, for example — now barely above 4% as of Friday evening (bond markets are closed today) — has been on a downtrend this year and has been roughly in the same range for three years:

But, but, but, the US dollar…. The dollar’s drop during the first half of 2025 has been falsely promoted in clickbait headlines and by braindead manipulative talking heads on TV, as “the steepest decline in more than a half a century,” or whatever.
What did occur is that the dollar indices had spiked in the last four months of 2024 and topped out at the very end of December. And that four-month spike was then unwound-plus-some over the six months exactly from the beginning of January through the beginning of July, with the euro and yen dominated DXY Dollar Index dropping 11% and the broader WSJ Dollar Index [BUXX] dropping 9% over the first six months of the year.
But even bigger six-month drops were common and bottomed out in:
The only thing that was unique about the 6-month drop in 2025 was that it started at the beginning of January. Only the start date was unique.
This chart shows the 6-month percentage change of the WSJ Dollar Index [BUXX], which tracks a basket of 16 major currencies.
The blue line indicates the 6-month 9% drop from the beginning of January through the beginning of July. Note all the even bigger 6-month drops that have dropped through the blue line over the past 23 years.

And of course, the dollar has bounced back some since the beginning of July with the WSJ Dollar Index rising today to 96.4, up by 2.6% from the low at the beginning of July.
The 16 currencies in the trade-weighted index are: Euro, Japanese Yen, Chinese Yuan, Canadian Dollar, Mexican Peso, South Korean Won, New Taiwan Dollar, Indian Rupee, Hong Kong Dollar, Singapore Dollar, British Pound, Australian Dollar, New Zealand Dollar, Norwegian Krone, Swiss Franc, and the Swedish Krona.

The Fed has been doing the opposite of “money printing” for over three years, having shed $2.4 trillion in assets by now – “money unprinting?” – and it continues to shed assets under its Quantitative Tightening program, and folks promoting the debasement trade need to take a look at this:

Other central banks too have been shedding assets under their QT programs, most notably the ECB and the Bank of Japan. Here are the balance sheets of some of the major central banks in relationship to the size of their economies, another eye-opener of what the debasement trade faces: Amazing How the Money-Printing World Has Reversed.

Color me unconvinced.  When the next financial cataclysm gets tripped there is little doubt that the great font of liquidity, the Fed, The Great Helmsman, will generate dollar swap lines for everyone on the golf courses both foreign and domestic.  And there will be mountains of debt to soak up with outright purchases.  The financial markets will be stabilized…after the carnage.
Wolf fails to mention that the Fed has issued $6T in debt since QT began in early 2022, and that is before the impending deluge.  Wolf is an insightful fellow, but he is like the butcher who manages at all times to keep his thumb on the scales.  As for CEPR, go to the website and click on People.  It looks to me like none of these People are likely to get off the bus to Consensusville anytime soon.
Debasement?  Ask the gold-bugs.  The olde-timey gold-bugs were kind of cranks.  Nobody really took them seriously.  These days there appears to be a better appreciation of tail-risk.  And as the tail-risk gets fatter…shit-coins, off-balance sheet crashes, ballooning debt, deregulation, endemic corruption, and on and on, new-timey gold bugs enter the market.  
They could be fleeing equity, munis, REITs, who knows, but they are having an impact.  Check out the price of gold Maple Leafs in the last couple of years.  Gold coin buyers are retail people.  They are not the behemoth central banks currently gorging on gold.  They are just riding the current, and given the monsters below the surface they will not be capitulating any time soon.
Yes, one doesn’t have to go back to Adam and Eve to understand 6-month drops in the dollar. Just to 1971 and the elimination of gold backing the dollar.  Now the schemers have to guess on the true value of a fiat currency (dollar).
In an abstract way, money is a human construct. It is worth whatever “value” that humans give it. If it’s not the almighty dollar, it’s something else. How long will the rest of the world “believe” in the dollar?
Tbh I wish I had invested all my savings into either crypto or gold once Trump got inaugurated.
It sucks watching everyone around me be flush with returns and not work and buy all these new cars and houses. 
Someone told me about Rocket Lab last year when it was 5$ and now that stock is plus 60.
Or Intel Stock when it was down to 20 and then Trump decided to get involved and it jumped to almost 40 which would have doubled my money. 
What am I supposed to do now that I’m 41 and the US has turned into a financialized economy? I work my ass off in the French quarter tending and trying to save up for a house which is gonna cost me about 300,000?
Bitcoin has been around since what 2012, and Yves and y’all have kept telling me it’s PROSECUTION FUTURES and whatever so I’ve listened to y’all since y’all are a money blog.
But HFS have I missed out on a ton of get rich opportunities now that I’m making somewhat decent money.
Buy whatever physical gold you can afford is my (non-financial expert) advice.
I started buying a little at $1400 over ten years ago, bought a bunch more at $2900 earlier this year and it’s now at $4100+.

Like actual gold bars?
US gold coins are the best. They have a known quantity of gold in them. Bars must be assayed if you take possession of them, so you have storage fees for bullion. You avoid fees and testing with coins.
Agree, coins are the best and they don’t have to minted in the USA.
Herd.
Maybe this is what Paul saw when he had his vision of the Golden 🏦Thread?
I’m gonna try not to nuke my eyeballs 👀 out participating in this…
You don’t have to buy gold bars to gain from the frenzy.  I own stock in Newmont Mining and it’s stock price has been rising along with price of gold.  The stock was up 5% in 1 day last week and has more than doubled since Jan. 2025.  Dumb luck…
Silver, poor man’s gold, is hot as well. It’s up 42% last three months.
Silver takes up way too much room though if you’re buying coins.
Silver, poor man’s gold …
Emphasis on the word poor. Silver just finally broke to a new all time high after just 45(!) years of waiting. It will go up like a rocket in a bull market and crash and burn in a bear market. Meanwhile, the bullion dealers make out like bandits charging 5%+ premium to both buyers and sellers. People balk at that for an ounce of gold, but don’t think twice about it for an ounce of silver. After all, that’s less than a cup of coffee …
Yes – I own some shares of Newmont (NEM) and Kinross (KGC) gold miners. Also Wheaton Precious Metals (WPM) is up over 60% since I bought it.
“Yves and y’all have kept telling me it’s PROSECUTION FUTURES and whatever so I’ve listened to y’all since y’all are a money blog.”
John Maynard Keynes once said, “Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.”
Of course, Keynes comment is targeted to those shorting a market in the bubble phase, but shorts have end dates and even though by definition a bubble is economically irrational that doesn’t mean they pop before your short/bet comes due – hence you can go broke before reality sets in on the other market participants.
If you agree there is a big bubble brewing now, then I suggest you stick to secure assets.  
In my opinion we are in the phase where people like you really get screwed.  This is the phase where everyday Joe’s start throwing money at the bubble… and the market keeps going up until it doesn’t.  And then those everyday Joe’s lose their money.
You see there is a flip side to what Keynes said… for those who pour their money into the market and don’t know when to leave, they too can become insolvent too.
And yes, maybe you didn’t invest in Bitcoin back in 2012, but what if you did?  Would you be out now?  What happens to the value of Bitcoin when a major liquidity crisis hits the system?
What secure assets?

@ Jonathan Holland Becnel
FWIW Mark Spitznagel of Universa investments is calling for a blow off top and then a like 80% crash in the stock market and thinks we are currently in the middle of that rally. IIRC he said we, ”could see” SPX around 8000 before the massive crash, so maybe 20% higher from here- obviously predicting exact numbers is a fool’s errand but still… so if that is what comes to pass then getting in now could be lucrative short term but potentially devastating if you don’t get out in time, so pretty high risk. As painful as it would be to remain in cash/t bills and watch this go way up before the big down, if this sucker goes down 80%ish that is like sp500 at 1800 or 2000 or so, and then one could buy assets at a much more reasonable price. Could hedge by keeping like 80-90% of savings in cash/4 week t bills and gamble with the other 10-20% so no risk of getting totally wiped out and having no cash to spend when financial assets are way cheaper but still not feel the depression one gets from missing out completely on a parabolic rally in basically all financial assets. I think Spitznagel compared what is happening right now to the beginning of 1929, euphoric high ahead, then massive crash. Good luck man, probably don’t let FOMO lizard brain overtake rational brain and make you put all your chips on the table at a time of irrational euphoria though, always be in a position where your gonna have $ to buy stuff when its cheap. I believe Spitznagel thinks there are lagging effects from the Fed raising rates so quickly and for so long that are going to be the catalyst that pops the bubble. I just finished his book ”The Dao of Capital” check it out if you get a chance, interesting book. None of this is financial advice lol
The US budget process gets increasingly chaotic as time goes by, do the figures even add up any more ? Does it still matter ?
Recent upturn in the dollar is because of the whiff of crash in the air. Mr Powell was out today saying the labour market is sick and he will be cutting rates. Mr Trump is taking the US past that event horizon and budgets will not count for much, he will take what he needs wherever he can find it and use it for what he wants.
It is all about the next bailout now, $ 10 trillion will be needed quickly, how to create it and who to distribute it. Krugerrands are the go for gold at home, 24 carat is not suitable for manual handling.
Bond market is calm assuming low inflation.  But west is cutting itself off from Russian resources and low cost/high quality Chinese mfg goods that are deeply embedded in western supply chains.  Imo west is rapidly becoming high cost producer.  Why would row trade with such a source?  They’re already buying fossil cheaper from Russia/iran than us, and far cheaper than sky-high eu prices.  Hope for mild winter.
I’m noticing attic exhaust fans listed on Amazon with ‘5 available, order soon’… and no ‘more on the way’.  Imo shortages likely by year end that will make it hard for many mfrs to stay in business.
Inflation has been low (and the dollar risen in value relative to other currencies?) Over the past few decades in large part because of globalization and offshoring production to low wage countries. Trump appears to be dead set on removing that offset. 
It will become much harder to hide Fed money printing in this new environment, even if the the Fed lowers printing slightly as this article points out is the current case (And as other commenters have pointed out, things could get messy real quick if Fed printing increases due to a new emergency).
With total US (private + public)  debt north of $100T, shouldn’t the government be printing at least $5T a year just to cover interest on that debt?
I think Dollar did debase itself when it ceased to be non-political neutral reserve currency. Now it is gradually being displaced by Gold which is a most non-political neutral asset with no counter party risk. President Trump’s arbitrary, indiscriminate, and often politically instigated imposition of tariffs across almost all countries is a trifle less blatant debasing of Dollar primacy than Biden’s freezing of Russia’s dollar billions.
The displacement has only just started. And it looks, it is irreversible.
Yeah but the problem of the gold standard still applies though right?
Like you are only allowed to spend what you have in physical bouillon?
Especially when the Rich hog it all, and “there’s none left.”
