Mark Cuban says the only way to eliminate billionaires would be to destroy the stock market — and doing so would wipe out the savings of ordinary Americans.
In a string of posts on BlueSky on Thursday night, the billionaire investor and former ""Shark Tank"" star rebuffed users who argued that wealth inequality could be solved by taxing or capping billionaires' wealth.
Cuban — whose $6 billion fortune from tech startups, investing, and owning the Dallas Mavericks makes him one of the world's richest people — said that extreme wealth is an inevitable byproduct of the market system.
""Billionaires will exist as long as stock markets exist,"" he wrote. ""Should we get rid of the stock market?""
When one user said they'd like to see the market go if it meant preventing ""disgusting examples of extreme wealth,"" Cuban replied: ""What should people do with the money they save?""
He warned that dismantling the market would have catastrophic effects for everyone, not just the rich.
Cuban was responding to another user who said that roughly 90% of the stock market is owned by the richest 10% of US households — a figure in line with Federal Reserve data showing that the top 10% hold about 93% of all stock market wealth.
He agreed with the statistic but argued that forcing those investors to sell would hurt everyone, not just the wealthy.
""Absolutely true,"" he wrote. ""But that 90 percent is trillions and trillions of dollars, owned by everyone else. If you make the top 10 pct sell 90 pct of the market, how close to zero value do you think the ownership of the 90 percent goes? You would wipe out the savings of more than half the country.""
While Cuban argued that billionaires are a necessary byproduct of thriving stock markets that benefit savers, organizations like Oxfam and the World Bank say ultra-rich accumulations are mainly driven by inheritance, monopoly power, and worsen inequality.
Cuban also argued that even if governments seized every dollar owned by billionaires, it wouldn't significantly improve public finances.
""You can take every penny that every billionaire has, and other than making a lot of people on here feel better, it wouldn't pay for the interest of the federal deficit or single-payer [healthcare],"" he said.
""And doing so would probably tank the markets and cause a depression. But other than that, the rich would be tasty!""
Still, Cuban said he would support a ""windfall tax"" on people earning $1 billion or more in taxable income in a single year.
He also questioned the feasibility of wealth taxes based on stock valuations, asking: ""If it's the value of their stock, will you refund the tax if the stock market corrects or crashes?""
At the same time, Cuban offered a glimpse of what he thinks fairer capitalism might look like.
Responding to a user who suggested capping CEO pay, raising worker wages, and changing laws so companies prioritize employees over shareholders, he said: ""I think every employee should be the same percent of their earnings in company stock as the CEO.""
And when another commenter suggested that public anger stems from billionaires acting selfishly, Cuban agreed, replying simply with three checkmarks.
""I'm more concerned that no one is trying to figure out how to help everyone else make more,"" he wrote.

1,2025-10-24,"It's been described as the mineral of the moment.
Millions of us are taking magnesium for a whole range of reasons. Can it help us sleep better? Sort our digestion problems? Give our busy brains a moment of peace?
In the fast-moving world of supplements, it's magnesium's time to shine.
And the industry is booming. The global magnesium market is worth nearly £3bn and that's set to nearly double over the next decade.
In a small factory, nestled in the Yorkshire Dales, huge plastic barrels of white powder are stacked up next to giant whirring machines.
Workers in hazmat suits carefully weigh out magnesium citrate - a compound made by mixing the mineral with citric acid - into shiny, steel containers.
""We are sending our supplies all over the world,"" Andrew Goring, manager director of Lonsdale Health, explains. ""Around the UK, obviously, but also to Australia, parts of Asia, Kuwait, Iraq.
""It's one of our biggest sellers and the market just keeps growing.""
He is shouting over the hum of the pill presser, a machine that resembles a Dalek, which pops out dozens of small white magnesium tablets a second.
""Do we actually need it?"" I bellow back. ""And why now, why has it become so popular?""
""Influencers, social media - that's what's pushing it,"" Mr Goring explains. ""We've known about magnesium and its benefits for years and now, finally, it's mainstream.""
I can almost hear the eye roll when I contact Kirsten Jackson, a dietitian who specialises in gut health.
""Clever marketing schemes,"" Ms Jackson says, ""magnesium is involved in areas people are willing to invest in: their sleep, digestion, mental health.""
But, she is keen to stress, this does not automatically mean we need supplements to improve those things.
Magnesium is one of several minerals in our bodies. The recommended daily amount for women is 270mg and for men, it's 300mg. We store about 25g.
It might make up less than 1% of us but ""it is involved in over 300 different processes"", Ms Jackson explains.
It is ""especially important for our brain and mood,"" she says, because it helps nerves send messages properly and supports the building blocks of brain cell membranes.
It also helps balance blood sugar levels, regulate blood pressure, and is an essential player in moving calcium and potassium in and out of our cells, which maintains the rhythm of our heartbeat.
So, surely popping a pill full of the stuff should keep our bodies running smoothly?
It's more complex than that, says Ms Jackson. For a magnesium supplement to work, we need to be lacking the mineral in the first place - and it's difficult to test for any deficiency because the vast majority of our magnesium is stored in our bones and tissues.
But on an individual level, many say the supplement has made a difference.
For Katie Curran, a communications specialist who has worked with some of the biggest fashion brands, sleeping well was something she could only dream about.
""A year ago, I was struggling,"" she confides. ""It would take so long to get to sleep, my brain was racing, and then I would get off only to wake a couple of hours later.""
Katie decided to try magnesium glycinate - a combination of magnesium and glycine, an amino acid with limited evidence linking it to better sleep.
After two weeks of taking 270mg a day, she says the noise in her head started to quieten. The racing thoughts slowed down, and she began to feel like she could function again.
""My sleep definitely improved, I had more energy. I became more active. Other things changed in my life, so I can't put it down to just one thing, but I think the magnesium supplements were an important part of the puzzle.""
While being deficient in magnesium can definitely affect sleep patterns, there isn't the evidence to say taking supplements will definitely improve your sleep.
Social media is awash with eager supplement-takers, many with posts stamped with ""commission paid"" in the corner - meaning they could earn money from their story or reel.
According to these influencers, it feels as though there is little magnesium can't help with, as they recommend a variety of different products.
Magnesium is often mixed with other compounds with the aim of helping support various parts of our bodies. For example, magnesium mixed with either L-threonate or glycinate is supposed to target brain health, which helps with sleep and stress relief.
If magnesium is combined with chloride, it is recommended for muscle tension and pre-menstrual cramps, while citrate and oxide blends are aimed at digestion and help with constipation.
 The majority of us can probably relate to having at least one of those issues. But as nutritionist Kristen Stavridis stresses, the problem is there is not enough strong evidence to show the majority of these different magnesium supplements have a positive effect on the healthy population.
And even if they did - we would need to be deficient in magnesium in the first place to see a benefit.
""We have supplement companies shouting out at us: 'We are all going to die',"" Ms Stavridis says, ""'Quick! Take my pill and - hey presto - there's your solution'.
""Many of us are not getting enough magnesium,"" she continues, ""around 10% of men and 20% of women are not getting the recommended daily intake.
""But just taking a supplement is not the answer.""
Take sleep health, for example. Ms Stavridis says there are many conflicting studies on whether magnesium supplements really make a difference. Some trials say it can have some benefits, while some randomised controlled trials - the gold standard - are more sceptical.
There is also the added complication of supplements potentially working against each other because of the way they interact in the body.
Taking zinc, for example - a supplement often recommended for peri-menopausal women - can also affect the absorption rate of magnesium.
Basically, Ms Stavridis says, it's a minefield, and not just a simple case of ""take this"" and you'll be fixed.
She recommends looking at diet first. But if you are thinking about taking magnesium supplements, Ms Stavridis advises taking half the amount recommended on the packet on a daily basis and seeing how you feel.
If healthy people take too much, their kidneys can get rid of it in ""expensive urine"", but there are still risks, like diarrhoea, vomiting and nausea.
For those with kidney disease, taking magnesium supplements can be dangerous and can cause hypermagnesemia - a potentially life-threatening condition that can leave someone with paralysis or in a coma.
Dietitian Kirsten Jackson also says most people should ""100% look at diet first"".
Foods like seeds, nuts, whole-grain breads, greens and fruit are good sources of magnesium, she says.
She warns that if you don't regularly consume these types of foods, you're probably also short of other essential nutrients like vitamin C, vitamin K, fibre and prebiotics too.
""One magnesium supplement is not going to sort all that.""

When I worked there 15 years ago they had around 85,000 employees, and there was a lot of bullshit teams, tech marketers, and desktop gaming promoters that literally did nothing. A team of only around 30 people or so in the VSD (volume server division) helped usher in the first x86 Mac Pro...so much bloat in so many places that didn't make money.
  At a recent count they are up to 125,000. Now they've fired 35,500. They really don't have that many more products than they had back then (they were working on failed compute and GPU back then too), so it sounds like they could trim some more and still be bloated.
  Regardless, in NYSE terms, this means their stock should jump by 5-10%, right?
First you hire a bunch of engineers because you don't want them working for potential competitors. It's one of the easiest ways to form a monopoly without running a foul of antitrust law.No one in the real world does this. It's a waste of money and wouldn't work even if it weren't a waste of money. Intel couldn't even absorb a majority of graduating students in the field in a given year, much less all of the more experienced and far more expensive labor. Shareholders would fire anyone stupid enough to even try doing this.
 
The only way something like this could feasibly work is in a completely new field that has few workers and is rapidly expanding. It still wouldn't work though because th

That's a one dimensional view. In fact if you stick with that one dimensional view it's worth noting that AMD doesn't have any spectacular increase in count of products either but somehow has 3x the number of employees over that same period.
Every engineer thinks the other departments are bullshit. I wonder if you would have still worked there if it weren't for those ""bullshit"" teams promoting the product you were making, because quite frankly 15 years ago Intel was at the top of their game so clearly doing 
Example is the ""I deal with the god damn customers so the engineers don't have to. I have people skills.""
As a sort of engineer it's great when you do have that person.
No I didn't. I'm following the OP's logic. Intel is no different, that's despite their product listing being higher, cadence being different, having acquired Altera, Habana labs, Mobileye, just to name the ones in the billions.
I didn't write the rules, I just made a comment following the absurdity. By the way Xilinx doesn't remote account for the increase. They weren't a company with twice the employee count of AMD, so even with your rules the point stands.
He said ""helped issue in"" so it's quite plausibly correct.  Lots of groups probably helped.
Their dominance was in the PC.  Intel, like M$, grew on the back of the PC and while that was the biggest source of income for any semiconductors there wasn't any challenger.  Problem is, another source of income, smartphones, grew to be bigger than the PC, and Intel didn't dominate that.
Intriguingly, if AMD had stuck with in-house manufacturing itself then it wouldn't be in a position to challenge Intel right now so Intel would be much better off still using its older fabs.

It's not kids who are trading $12,000 knife skins, it's Russian money launderers
You can trade up lesser items for greater items now, at least in the glove and knife category.  So there are effectively more gloves/knives entering the market and diluting the value of those already on sale.
items that cost more than what the marketplace sales cap are now below the market cap because they are more easily earnable while deleting tons and tons and TONS of items costing $20 before, now $100 from the store.
The ""value"" erased is like saying a stock on the stock market is worth 2 billion dollars less, but Valve doesn't earn any profit from skins traded via 3rd party sites, and that's what is hit here.
First party transactions are now generating loads of revenue from transaction fees, bringing the market back to Valve and away from sketchy third party sites.
At the end of the day I can't comprehend why people are paying for this stuff though. It's just a texture which you could trivially mod in before, at least when I was big into CS in 1.X days and CS:S.

I still struggle to wrap my head around what kind of absolute moron would pay the price of a pretty decent new car for a virtual knife in a free-to-play videgame.

Valve does earn money on Steam marketplace transcations, where many CS2 items are traded, even at high dollar values.
Is this article talking real money or in-game money? I don't think someone would pay $20,000 to get some some kind of picture in a game? Doesn't make any sense ...
Nevermind, I just found the answer and it's depressing: Skinport is the easy-to-use skin marketplace for CS:GO/CS2 items that allows you to buy and sell CS:GO/CS2 skins for real money.. People are either dumb or use stolen money.
Both.  Most people are dumb, and many would use stolen money if they could (and many do, though usually not to buy video game cosmetics).
Intelligence and morality are both things that people are born without, and have to learn.  Some people are born pre-disposed to be good at learning (be that knowledge, virtue, or both), but even so, if they are born into unfortunate circumstances then the things that they will learn will be wrong and harmful.
So, in order to reach adulthood with sharp intelligence and a fu 
If you're not dumb and have stolen money, these types of exchanges are ideal for money laundering.

I immediately noped out.
I agree that there are probably a lot of profiteers that launder drugs money, but still ... I will assume the rest of 97% are just young people - as someone said below between 18-24 which is student life ... Even if you're dumb - how can throw parent's money or any hard-earned money on these things? You still need to eat, no?

""I spent my reward on ale and whores!"" - Skull the troll, probably.
In other words, it's more about Valve trying to bring the ""game"" back. Money laundering be damned, they have to make sure the CS2 community is a healthy one with active players who are actually playing the game.
If the stuff is used for money laundering, they want to get out of that and likely they don't want to have items with so much rarity that every sale has to be reported for being over $10,000.
Anyhow, the market is irrational, and reacts irrationally. I'm sure in 90 days when the dust settles we'll fin

I'm not saying any of this is real, but I bet some sizable purchases have been driven by dreams of such.
Have you ever been to Las Vegas, NV?
I've played FPS games since the original Doom was the hot new thing, and I've never understood why anyone would pay real money for cosmetic player doodads.
I've never understood why anyone would pay real money for cosmetic player doodads.Same here - but only don't understand why people would pay such an exorbitant amount of money for it; I think there's value in paying a small fee because someone took the time to crate it (time is money), but there's no real ""scarcity"" of the thing, it's all artificial, which is where these crazy figures come from.

I don't understand why people spend a lot of money on tennis shoes or a great number of other things either.

But I'm also a cheap bastard.
Similarly....most people probably don't understand why I have a $2000 pool stick.I think there's a difference between something that's ""cheap"" and something that's worth the price for the quality.But branding is different. A $50 pool stick that is functionally equivalent in every way to that $2000 pool stick of yours, but the only difference being the silkscreen on yours, then you're obviously overpaying (or a tool, which ever you want to claim as your own).

Well, you don't know about pool sticks (;
Up to around the $500 mark, you can gain real functionality or basic quality improvements.
Over the $500 mark, you're paying mostly for design and materials, with only slight improvement in basic quality. Depending on what you're buying, more of that can be going into quality or features that affect playability.
There is a fundamental difference between a .$50 stick and a $200, for example.
As for silk screening....that's in the realm of cheap sticks. Expensive sticks h 
I understand why people would pay a little bit of money but not a lot of moneyIf you play the game 10-20 hours every week. It can make sense to spend 5 bucks a month and get new skins. The game looks a bit more fresh this wayEven $30 would not make sense to me.
For the people we are talking about, $20,000 IS a little bit of money.  Welcome to the world of income disparity. A few people with too much money and not enough to spend it on driving up prices for everyone else.
I can't imagine there are really that many billionaire gamers out there. Perhaps Mohammed Bin Salman (known to be an avid gamer is a mega purchaser or something. Musk is known to just play people to game for him.
In any event, $20k to a billionaire may be like $20 to me, but I certainly wouldn't pay $20 for some cheesy character skin. I might pay $20 for DLC or something that actually impacts game play.
People are/were paying $20,000 in actual U.S. dollars for some item in an online game?
Am I reading that correctly?
And get this: The item does *not* affect the gameplay!
Well, that's just silly.
Who are these people??
Well, that's just silly.Who are these people??Tough call.  Are they narcissists with a money laundering need, or money launderers with narcissistic tendencies?My money is on both.

There is no economy for standard **game playing**. No one's games or game playing are being affected.
Instead, there is an unsupported, unsanctioned black market economy for the use of real money to buy cosmetic decorations in the game. And it's not like many people wants to pay these market-manipulated prices to USE the skins... it's a purely speculative market that's maybe 1% more rational than trading NFTs.
The closer to zero that market cap is, the more correct the valuation.
Oh fuck off.  The headline is exactly correct.  Something was worth X yesterday and today it's worth Y, where Y is substantially less than X.
If you had to sell right now, you would get far less than for the product than if it you sold it yesterday. Hence, erased market cap.
It's used every single day in the financial industry and is regularly quoted in headlines when a company's stock plunges.
The headline can be exactly correct.  Doesn't mean our we've-always-done-it-that-way process of measurement isn't still exactly fucked. 
Finance industry makes up terms and concepts all the damn time as they invent new ""markets"" out of fucking thin air.  Sometimes those are concepts that should never exist in Capitalism.

CS used to be awesome in it's first incarnation. Cheaters and everything else ruined it. It was awesome when you could get on a server with your friends and have a fair round. If I have to play for in game items, I'm being played. Lootboxes are a serious joke. If you need to gamble, stick with pokemon cards.
I think I have successfully avoided putting real world money into the video game fashion show industry.  And stories like this remind me I made the correct decision.  I play a game for fun.  I could care less if my character looks the same as someone who just started.
At least it was when I stopped playing a long time ago.
The last CS game I played was 1.5, the last to have the iconic HL1-era orange menus and the specific menu sounds. The most you could customize were the sprays. So imagine my shock when I found out it now features ...loot boxes and cosmetics? I will never understand people who would pay for such things.
Good. Nothing in CS is worth more than $5.

""May the forces of evil become confused on the way to your house.""
-- George Carlin"
4,2025-10-24,"The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is the top Android phone on the market, from the S Pen stylus to the huge, bright screen.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

If you're in need of a good premium phone deal, Best Buy's outlet sales event might be a good place to lurk. For example, Best Buy is offering up to $450 off the price of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra when you let them activate it for you. If you'd prefer to activate it yourself, you can still save $350, and either way, it's a good price on our favorite premium Android phone and a performance powerhouse.
The S25 Ultra features the Samsung S Pen stylus, as well as a large, 6.9-inch AMOLED display, a 5,000mAh battery, and a powerful set of cameras that users love. It also comes with Samsung's latest Galaxy AI features, and a software update promise of seven years, much to the light of those who like to future-proof their devices. While this particular deal is for the 256GB version of the device, Best Buy is also offering a discount on the upgraded 512GB configuration for those who have a little more money to spend.
Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra (256GB): $1,299.99 as low as $849.99 at Best Buy
Our favorite premium Android phone is still available for up to $450 off during Best Buy's outlet sale, which runs through this weekend. In order to get the full savings value, buyers must let Best Buy connect the phone to a carrier, though they can still save $350 on the device if they'd prefer to connect it to a carrier themselves.
✅Recommended if: you're looking for a phone of under $1,000 that can offer industry-leading performance and a large, vibrant display; having powerful cameras for photo and video is a major selling point for you; you want a phone that comes with a first-party stylus.
❌Skip this deal if: you have sensitive eyes and you need a phone with a robust set of flicker reduction settings; you'd rather go with a mid-range phone than one with an expensive, premium-level price tag.
The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is the best premium Android phone, especially due to its beautiful, vibrant 6.9-inch AMOLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate, the powerful Snapdragon CPU offering swift performance, and the range of solid cameras. The rear cameras include a 50MP telephoto lens, a 10MP telephoto lens, a 50MP ultrawide lens, and a 200MP wide lens. On the front, the S25 Ultra sports a 12MP wide lens.
The S25 Ultra also comes with the S Pen stylus, along with 12GB of RAM, and, for this particular version, 256GB of storage—though users can also upgrade to 512GB, if that isn't enough.
It's worth noting that, for those who need a wide range of PWM settings, the S25 series is probably not the way to go, as none of them include flicker-reduction options. It's also still fairly expensive, even with the price cut, though buyers who have had their eyes on this model may want to consider picking it up while it's under $1,000.

A few years ago, FAANG engineers were famously ""locked in"" by massive equity windfalls. Today, the same dynamic is playing out with AI chipmakers.
According to Levels.fyi data, engineers at AMD, Broadcom, and Nvidia are sitting on life-changing stock gains.
Heavy equity-based offers made in late 2023 have ballooned as these stocks have soared. Some Nvidia mid-level engineers, for instance, have seen total compensation swell from roughly $360,000 to $670,000.
Broadcom and AMD engineers are experiencing similar locked-up wealth increases, according to Levels.fyi estimates.

This is the new cost of leaving. Imagine getting 10,000 restricted stock units at $100 a share, which would be worth $1 million over four years. That's the typical vesting period for equity awards like this.
At a normal company, the stock might go up a bit, or it might fall. So your year 3 and 4 vests would probably be worth about $500,000 in total, or maybe $750,000 if you're lucky and the stock goes up a bit.
What if you're at a fancy AI company, and the stock triples? That total 4-year award would balloon to $3 million. Walking away after year 2 could mean forfeiting about $1.5 million. So people often stay.
The ""golden handcuffs"" haven't disappeared; they've just migrated from Big Tech software giants to the silicon stars powering the AI boom.
Levels.fyi calls these ""silicon handcuffs.""

Forget 60/40. A chief investment officer shared how to split your portfolio to give you exposure to private markets, depending on your risk appetite.
Sinead Colton Grant, the chief investment officer at BNY's wealth division, said the traditional strategy of splitting your portfolio 60% on stocks and 40% on bonds no longer yields the same returns.
""What a 60/40 portfolio would have given you in the late 90s in terms of exposure to the broader global economy — that's giving you something a lot more narrow today,"" she said.
""If you look at the changes in market structure over the last 20-plus years, they have brought us to a place where to have full exposure to the economy, you need to have exposure to private assets,"" she added.
She said the number of public companies in the US has dramatically fallen in the last 30 years amid greater regulation and the growth of private credit since the financial crisis. The US had around 8,000 public companies in 1996, compared to about 4,000 in 2024, per the World Bank.
""Some of our clients will say, 'I only want public markets,' and that's fine, but if a client comes to us and says, 'What do you really recommend?' We include private markets,"" Colton Grant said.
An investor can gain exposure to private markets by accessing private equity, such as through a mutual fund or an ETF, or investing in venture capital, for example.
Golton Grant said an investor with a moderate risk appetite should look at investing 50% in stocks, 30% in bonds, and 18 to 20% in alternative investments.
""Alternatives, for us, is private markets and hedge funds,"" Colton Grant added.
For a more aggressive strategy, allocate ""a little bit more"" to alternatives, she said.
But the less risk you want, the more you should reduce that exposure, she said.
For the moderate risk portfolio, hedge funds would comprise about 3 to 5%, she said. Of the remaining 15%, 75% would be in private equity and venture capital, and the remaining 25% would be split between private credit and real estate, Colton Grant said.

The little 10,000mAh power banks you see everywhere are fine for topping up your phone once, maybe twice if you’re lucky. But when you’re camping for the weekend, dealing with a power outage or spending a full day at an outdoor event, that tiny capacity just doesn’t cut it. You need serious juice, and that’s exactly what the Anker PowerCore delivers. Right now, Amazon has slashed this beast of a power bank from $149 down to just $79, which is an all-time low for a device packing a massive 60,000mAh capacity.
See at Amazon
The 60,000mAh capacity translates to 192 watt-hours of stored energy which means you can charge an iPhone 17 more than 10 times over or keep a 3-watt LED lamp running for over 42 hours straight. That’s the difference between fumbling in the dark during a blackout and having reliable lighting for nearly two full days. The dual USB-C ports deliver 60 watts and 27 watts respectively so you can fast-charge a laptop and a smartphone at the same time without sacrificing speed.
Anker built this power station with emergencies in mind and itâs apparent in its design. Thereâs a built-in light on top of the power station thatâs retractable; itâs incredibly bright which makes it perfect for nighttime campsite setups or traveling during power outages. Still, the feature that stands out in terms of safety is its dedicated SOS button for an emergency strobe light function. The intelligent display screen on the front lets users know exactly what their power levels, wattage output, and time left are, so theyâre never surprised by a power level status they canât gauge on their own in the absence of wall power access.
The solar panel compatibility is what elevates it from a mere power bank to a off-grid system on its own: You can hook up a compatible solar panel via the input socket to charge it using only sunlight which is fantastic for long camping ventures or readiness systems for power outages. Charging the system is quite easy; simply hook up the USB-C to USB-C charging cord to a wall socket so it only takes 5-6 hours using your wall socketâs wattage, which is quite acceptable for such massive capacity.
As for the build quality, itâs definitely robust without being completely bulky either. Of course, itâs a bit heavier, thanks to the presence of battery cells but it is something that can be easily thrown into a backpack or even into an auto-emergency kit in your car, if need be. The build quality appears to be more resilient to rough handling, which is quite an aspect if one is supposed to be using it outdoors, say in an RV during an adventure vacation. Anker warrants it with a three-year warranty, which is an assurance on their own part regarding its durability.
At $79, this deal represents a 47 percent discount and brings the price per watt-hour down to an incredibly competitive level. Most portable power stations in this capacity range still hover around $120 to $200 so catching this at under $80 is fantastic.

The Xbox Elite Series 2 controller has a heftier feel, made from heavier materials to give you some real weight to hold onto in your hand when compared to the standard Xbox wireless controller. It’s also got a rubberized grip and short hair triggers. The thumbstick mobility can be adjusted to your exact preferences, plus you get a lot of swappable parts to truly cater to your playstyle. That normally retails for $180 (even though Amazon says its usually $200), but right now, the site has it one sale for just $153.
See at Amazon
While you can get the white Elite Series 2 controller for the cheaper price of just $130, that only comes with the core controller plus a tool for thumbstick adjustment and a USB-C cable. The Xbox Elite Series 2 controller in black comes with the whole kit and caboodle. Along with the thumbstick tool and charging cable, you get a charging dock to place your controller in when you’re done playing. This will ensure you always are starting any gaming session at 100%.
You also receive a set of four back paddles which can be assigned to any button function. By default, they will be assigned to the face buttons of A, B, X, and Y. This any first person shooter play so much better. No more do you have to take your thumb off the right stick to jump or to reload or to slide or switch weapons. Just tap one of the paddles without giving up your aim.
On top of that, it comes with three pairs of additional thumbsticks in different styles. The default ones are similar to what you find on Xbox’s standard controller, with the concave center and grips along the edges. The first additional pair of sticks is just a backup of the standard pair. Then you also get a dome designed set of sticks as well as the standard style but taller. It felt weird at first, but I like using the short standard on the left stick but then the tall one on the right which allows for more precise movements while aiming.
Your last swappable piece is the additional d-pad which has the classic plus-sign design so you can switch between whichever of the two you prefer.
And then all those pieces not currently in use on your controller can hang back in the included carrying case. This fits your Xbox Elite Series 2 controller plus all the little bits and bobs, making traveling with it to a friend’s house convenient.

10,2025-10-24,"It's lost nearly $2 billion of its value, and counting
Counter-Strike has long been known for two things: tight tactical FPS gameplay and a thriving player marketplace effectively valued at literal billions of dollars. Now, thanks to a recent update from Valve, the latter is in a downward spiral, having lost 25% of its value — or $1.75 billion — overnight.
First, some context. Counter-Strike is a free-to-play multiplayer shooter. As with most other F2P games, it generates revenue from selling cosmetics. They arrive in lootbox-like Cases, which are opened by Keys purchased with real-world currency. They can also be obtained through trading with other players and purchasing from Steam Community Market. Beyond Steam, unofficial third-party marketplaces for CS cosmetics have also popped up as channels for buying and selling items.
Because items are obtained at random through opening Cases, rarer items fetch the highest value on the open marketplaces. Items of lower-rarity tiers can also be traded in at volume for an item of a higher tier via trade up contracts. Previously, Knives and Gloves could not be obtained through trade up contracts, exponentially increasing their value as highly sought-after items. Prior to the most recent update, some Knives, like a Doppler Ruby Butterfly Knife, could fetch around $20,000 on third-party storefronts like CSFloat.
Following Valve's Oct. 22 update to Counter-Strike, the second-highest-tier, Covert (Red), can now be traded up and turned into Knives and Gloves. Essentially, this means that a previously extremely rare and highly sought-after cosmetic is going to be much more obtainable for those who increasingly want it, reducing the value of Knives and Gloves on the open marketplace.
And this is where the market descends into a freefall. Now, that Butterfly Knife mentioned above? It's going for around $12,000, as people are essentially dumping their stock, with 15 sold over the past 16 hours at the time of this writing.
Bloomberg reported the market for Counter-Strike cosmetic items dropped 25% overnight from Wednesday evening into Thursday morning. It's lost about $1.84 billion in value, according to Pricempire, which tracks and analyses the market for CS items. ""This completely changes the supply of Counter-Strike’s most sought-after and expensive tier of items,"" Pricempire marketing manager Ethan MacDonald told Bloomberg.
As sellers attempt to recoup their investments, similar fire sales like the one happening at CSFloat are occurring at other sites. One such site, Skin Port, even put us in a waiting room to access it; traffic was overwhelming its servers.
Just like how NFT or cryptocurrency values can drastically shift, Counter-Strike item traders are seeing their stock rapidly change in value, and not for the best. While some items of lower-rarity tiers have gone up in value, and Reds might see a bump now that they can be traded up into Knives and Gloves, that can't make up for the sudden drop at the top of the cosmetics market.
We'll have to wait and see if the market levels out or if it continues to crash. Plenty of players and CS traders must be eagerly awaiting more news: As of this writing, Pricempire's servers had crashed.
We want to hear from you! Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful.

So Valve made a stupidly  rare set of items slightly easier to acquire, and now they're selling for a slightly less (but still very) stupid price?

Reminds me of the early Destiny 2 days and people spending $2k+ to have account recoveries unlock weapons like Not Forgotten... Except this is so, so much worse. Spending 12k+ on a purely virtual item, even if the intention is just to flip it, is just bonkers to me. I guess I'm the weird one though 
It's not slightly less value. The market itself dropped from being worth $6b to being worth $3.1b. Many prices are half of what they were 3 days ago. This was not just a small change to the market. 
Who could have predicted this might happen in a market dedicated exclusively to the resale of imaginary products, originally bought with non-currency tokens which you traded actual currency for, for a game you can't own, in a store run by a billionaire corporation, who can make any decision they want regarding those products at any time, with effectively zero tangible repercussions?
The irony of the gaming industry's incessant hatred of NFTs: 

An article reporting on an incident where the risk of a developer making changes to a set of centralised digital assets causing financial loss to owners of said asset having eventuated, while simultaneously using NFT market volatility as an example of the market volatility that is now occurring. 

Its almost like we need a technology that could mitigate this risk.. Maybe we could have a decentralised ledger, where code is transparent and immutable contracts are possible? 

If only someone would develop such a technology... Surely no one would be against it? 
Most people understand all this as simply gambling, and while nfts would provide a fairer way to gamble, I don’t care that much. 

NFTs remain a technology with no productive value, and the people that love them are transparently grifters. 
I would really appreciate it if journalists would be more careful with their words. 

What we are talking about trading are not “items” in any real sense. Calling them that allows what are effectively gambling businesses to pretend they are something they are not.

I am finding more and more journalists willing to use the language of storytelling (eg “he feels this” “he thinks this” rather than “he SAID this” “he DID this”), and likewise with this article, assigning words to bits of code as if they are real. They are not real. Stop it. 
They aren't ""physical items"" but they're items. An item is ""an individual article or unit, especially one that is part of a list, collection, or set."" 

If you're going to be a pedant at least you could understand what words actually mean.
It isn't a F2P game, it's a F2P mode. MP modes cannot be games, much in the same way pamphlets cannot be books. Games have a narrative, a journey you as the player have to undertake. Humble beginnings, through struggling journeys, before the climactic conclusion; same as books. A MP mode features none of that. In the same way we get lazy and call something like Tetris a ""game"" (it's a puzzle sim, there's no narrative journey anywhere), anti-consumer GAAS titles like CS simply aren't games; they're just MP modes. 

That's not saying you can't enjoy it, though I mean the casuals who do have created the hell most of us gamers have to sift through today by supporting anti-consumer GAAS titles, but you can still enjoy it. You just need to call it what it is. For instance, GTA is trash, everyone knows this. If you enjoy a bad game that's fine, I enjoy plenty of bad movies! The difference is casuals have a hard time admitting it because of pride. Gamers have no problem calling something what it is, but the casuals? Tough times when it comes to them.
Is Chess not a game? Go? Uno?
Thomas 

I want to agree with the OP in spirit, but I agree there are things I call games that have no narrative. 

I’m curious if there is a better word for board games and even sports games that MP CGs slot into. 

""MP modes cannot be games, much in the same way pamphlets cannot be books. Games have a narrative, a journey you as the player have to undertake.""

Strange definition. Most games I played growing up didnt have a narrative: hide and seek, tag, hungry hungry hippos, etc. This seems like a very arbitrary requirement to suddenly impose on computer games. I don't think it'll catch on.
All novels are books; not all books are novels. You're saying that ""game"" can only applied to narrative-based video games that are akin to novels, which is very much putting the cart before the horse. ""Game"" has had a meaning for hundreds years while narrative video games have been around for about 45-50 years at most, and that's counting something like ""Adventure"" as a narrative. Board games like chess and backgammon have much more in common with CS than they do with Horizon Zero Dawn.

I get wanting to separate great narrative games from other styles, but you don't get to deny that the other styles are still ""games"" any more than you can deny that dictionaries, encyclopedias and textbooks are ""books."" Content and form are two different things!
This is so untrue I'm inclined to think and AI wrote it. "

Today, in the CalculatedRisk Real Estate Newsletter: NMHC on Apartments: Market conditions ""Soften"" in Q3

Excerpt: From the NMHC: Borrowing Conditions Continue to Improve While Most Respondents Report an Unchanged Market Market Tightness Index (31) came in well below the breakeven level of 50 this round, indicating lower rent growth and higher vacancies compared to July, while the Sales Volume Index (59), Equity Financing Index (57), and Debt Financing Index (78) signaled improved market conditions.

“A softening labor market combined with high levels of new apartment supply is resulting in slowing rent growth in many parts of the country,” noted NMHC’s Chief Economist, Chris Bruen. “This continues to be most pronounced in sunbelt markets, many of which are currently seeing falling rents.”

“We’ve seen a modest decline in long-term interest rates over the past three months—the 10-Year Treasury Yield is currently down 28 basis points (bps) from July—resulting in improved conditions for debt financing and an uptick in apartment deal flow.”  
...• The Market Tightness Index came in at 31 this quarter, indicating looser market conditions. Only 9% of respondents thought market conditions were tighter compared to three months ago, 47% of respondents thought conditions had become looser, while 43% reported unchanged market conditions relative to July. There is much more in the article.

14,2025-10-24,"We're seven weeks out from when iPhone 17 preorders started on September 12, and Apple still hasn't caught up with demand (though the iPhone Air is far more easily available than Apple would like). BGR has tracked iPhone 17 delivery times every Friday since September 12, following the stock fluctuations in key markets in North America, Europe, and Asia. Unlike previous years, it's not just the newest Pro and Pro Max models that see prolonged delivery times. The standard iPhone 17, with its affordable price and Pro-grade specs, has been a massive hit with consumers.
Seven weeks after preorders started, the base iPhone 17 model is sold out in various markets, with shipping delays holding at 2-3 weeks for all color and storage combinations. The iPhone 17 Pro Max is also sold out online in some countries, although others have caught up with demand. iPhone 17 Pro availability also worsened compared to last week in France and the U.K., but improved in the U.S. The only iPhone Air stock constraints appear to be in China. Interestingly, Japan is the only country of the ones we've been tracking where all four 2025 iPhones are available to buy online with no shipping delays.
Our findings align with what analysts have been saying for the better part of October. The three iPhone 17 versions are popular with consumers around the world, while the Air is selling poorly in most markets except China. Just this week, reports highlighted the strong sales of the iPhone 17 Pro Max in the U.S. and the standard iPhone 17's popularity in China in the first 10 days of sales, while other stories noted that Apple will dramatically reduce iPhone Air production.
Every week, we've been tracking iPhone 17 delivery estimates in the U.S., Canada, France, Germany, Switzerland, Ireland, China, and Japan. We've used the same online purchase simulation for each of Apple's local online stores, looking at all the possible storage and color combinations for the four models. The following shipping estimates are accurate as of the morning of October 24:
Our findings can be easily replicated, but caveats exist. We have no idea how much stock Apple has assigned for each of these markets, and how much supply is available in brick-and-mortar retail stores. Also, estimates can shift throughout the day, as Apple updates stock availability and continues to sell the new iPhones. 
If you placed an order in the past few weeks, Apple has either shipped it to you or is getting ready to do so. If you buy one of the iPhone models that are out of stock today, you'll have to wait anywhere from 7 business days to 3 weeks, depending on the market and model. It's likely that other markets are dealing with similar stock inconsistencies. Finally, electronics stores and mobile operators might offer different shipping estimates depending on the market. Your best bet remains Apple's online and retail stores, if they're available in your region."

Dronemaker DJI is hinting that we could be in store for one last drone launch before the end of the year. However, leakers already have spoilers for what appears to be a sequel to the small, cheap, and incredibly loud DJI Neo drone. The little drone could scream as loud as a bansheeâs wail, which makes it the perfect doohickey to bring us frights before All Hallowsâ Eve. However, it likely wonât be coming to the U.S. anytime soon over the governmentâs own fears of Chinese surveillance.
Drone and action camera leaker Igor Bogdanov posted numerous images on X showing off what is clearly a successor to the DJI Neo, likely to be called the Neo 2. Bogdanov has a relatively accurate track record for leaks, so the images may be coming from DJI’s upcoming official announcement. Judging purely by the pics, the new Neo drone sports an updated propeller cage and an expanded antenna on the back. It still appears to be the same small size as the first Neo, though it apparently has additional sensor bars on the front panel.
ðYou'll love the specs.) For now, here's just a little bit of info for you:ð Gesture and voice controlð New omnidirectional sensorsð¸ 2-axis gimbalð 19 minutes in the airð  Auto return homeâ¡ï¸ Direct chargingand…We have to leave something for them.ð#djineo2 pic.twitter.com/d8cSP8lcp3
— Igor Bogdanov (@Quadro_News) October 24, 2025

According to Bogdanov, the new drone could include an enhanced battery life that promises 19 minutes of flying time compared to the previous 10 to 15 minutes on the first DJI Neo. Even better, the Neo 2 could support a 2-axis gimbal that will let you spy your surroundings without having to spin the drone along its x-axis. With those extra antennas, the new drone could have a larger range than the original Neoâs effective operating range of only 50 meters (without using a controller). The new DJI Neo 2 could even support omnidirectional sensors, which hints at possible obstacle avoidance you typically only get when you move up to the DJI Mini class for several hundred dollars more.
The added features could boost the DJI Neo 2âs price above the original $200 starting price (before you added additional accessories like a controller and multiple batteries). That is, if you can actually bring it to the U.S. once it’s officially on store shelves. The China-based companyâs productsânot just its dronesâare facing a full ban on U.S. sales. In the meantime, the U.S. has effectively soft-banned all of the dronemaker’s imports. The federal government has labeled DJI a âChinese Military Companyâ and claims its consumer-end drones represent a national security risk. Earlier this month, DJI filed an appeal over its designation with the U.S. Court of Appeals. Still, the end result is that U.S.-based buyers have very few options for purchasing DJIâs products.
Itâs left many U.S. drone flyers pulling their hair out, as DJI still offers some of the best and most affordable flying cameras. Back in September, DJI showed off its Mini 5 Pro drone with a larger, 1-inch CMOS sensor inside its light frame. That drone was selling for 799 euros, or under $1,000 in U.S. dollars. It’s still not available for Stateside flyers.
In a statement, DJI told Gizmodo, “DJI remains dedicated to the U.S. market and is optimizing our strategy to best serve our customers amidst evolving local conditions.â If these drones were to come to the U.S., it would still need to deal with President Donald Trumpâs love of tariffs and the ongoing international shipping snafu that is literally destroying shipments before they can get to consumers. So if you plan to order a new Neo from overseas, just make sure the little drone arrives at your door, or else UPS will literally go Ghostbusters on your poor package.

The year-over-year inflation rate heated up to 3.0% in September, back to where it stood in January.
Economists expected last month's rate to be 3.1% after an uptick to 2.9% in August.
Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, also increased 3% over the year in September. It was also expected to be 3.1%, which would have matched rates in July and August.
Core CPI increased 0.2% over the month between August and September, short of the 0.3% forecast that would have matched July and August's rates.
CPI increased 0.3% over the month between August and September, below the 0.4% forecast and the previous rate.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics was supposed to publish September's consumer price index report on October 15, but the release was delayed when the government shut down on October 1. The shutdown, which is now the second-longest in US history, has affected the compensation and employment of many federal workers and some agencies' operations.
""The delayed September CPI print showed slight stubbornness, primarily driven by goods inflation, with services inflation indicating signs of moderating,"" Ryan Weldon, investment director and portfolio manager at IFM Investors, said.
BLS said the price of gas was the biggest factor in the monthly rise. That rose 4.1% over the month, way above the previous 1.9% increase. However, the gas index fell 0.5% over the year.
The food index rose 3.1% year over year. It rose 0.2% over the month, less than the previous 0.5% increase. Beef and veal prices rose 1.2% over the month but 14.7% over the year, the largest year-over-year rise since March 2022.
The BLS's jobs report wasn't published earlier this month due to the shutdown and hasn't been rescheduled. The Fed is meeting on October 28 and October 29 to discuss rates, and given the lack of official data, they may use private data releases and previous jobs reports to understand how the labor market has been performing.
""In our view, the Fed is increasingly focused on supporting the labor market, especially as inflation risks appear transitory and tariff-driven,"" a note from global financial services company Raymond James before the latest CPI report said.
Large companies and small businesses have been figuring out whether to increase prices, reduce head count, and make other business changes due to tariffs and economic uncertainty.
While the full picture of the job market remains murky, today's CPI report at least gives Fed members some insight into prices. The Social Security Administration will also be able to use the fresh inflation figures to calculate and announce the annual cost-of-living adjustment for benefits.
The Fed cut rates for the first time this year in September, providing some relief to Americans' wallets, and is expected to make another rate cut. CME FedWatch showed an overwhelming probability of a 25-basis-point cut next week and a slim chance that the range will be held steady.
With inflation ticking up less than expected and a soft job market, the Fed will likely cut rates again.
""This will be framed as an insurance cut, with hopes that by December the shutdown is over and the Fed has a clearer read on jobs,"" Olu Sonola, the head of US economic research at Fitch Ratings, said.
Median inflation expectations for one year ahead increased for the third straight time in a New York Fed survey, rising from 3.2% in August to 3.4% in September.

17,2025-10-24,"Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer will push allies to provide Ukraine with more long-range missiles to strike Russian targets at a meeting in London on Friday.
He will host Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky along with the so-called ""coalition of the willing"", comprising of more than 20 of Ukraine's allies who have agreed to provide Kyiv security guarantees once a ceasefire is brokered.
Zelensky has been pleading for weeks for more long-range weapons from the West, a move Russia has warned would escalate the conflict. 
Ukraine's leader is travelling from Brussels, where he met EU leaders on Thursday seeking financial support. 
Zelensky arrives days after US President Donald Trump's decision to finally apply further sanctions against Russia.
Sir Keir is hoping to maintain the momentum by increasing the pressure on Moscow to negotiate an end to the war.
Among the leaders attending Friday's summit will be Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Netherlands' Dick Schoof. Others including French President Emmanuel Macron will join virtually.
Sir Keir will urge leaders to ramp up the provision of long-range weapons after a successful attack on a chemical plant in Bryansk, Russia, using British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles.
""The only person involved in this conflict who does not want to stop the war is President Putin,"" Sir Keir said.
""And his depraved strikes on young children in a nursery this week make that crystal clear,"" he added.
Two children were among at least seven killed in a wave of Russian strikes on Ukraine, which hit a nursery in the second biggest city Kharkiv.
Sir Keir will also announce 100 additional air defence missiles will be delivered to Ukraine earlier than planned, as outlined in a £1.6bn deal struck between the UK and Ukraine in March.
""Time and again we offer Putin the chance to end his needless invasion, to stop the killing and recall his troops, but he repeatedly rejects those proposals and any chance of peace,"" Sir Keir said.
Long-range missiles have become a key demand in Zelensky's talks with allies.
Trump floated the possibility of the US selling Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine, but Zelensky came away empty-handed from a White House meeting last week.
Sir Keir will consult Western allies on how to take Russian oil and gas off the global market. 
They will also discuss using frozen Russian assets to provide Ukraine with financial loans, although the plan faced a lack of political consensus and legal hurdles at the Brussels summit on Thursday.
The EU stopped short of agreeing to a proposal to use up to €140bn (£122bn) in frozen Russian assets to financially prop up Ukraine.
However, the leaders agreed to help support Ukraine's ""financial needs"" for the next two years.
The US also announced sanctions on Wednesday against Russia's two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, as part of efforts to add financial pressure on Moscow to enter ceasefire negotiations.
Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. It currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory, including the southern Crimea peninsular Moscow annexed in 2014.
The three men, aged 48, 45, and 44, were arrested at addresses in west and central London.
Security adviser Matthew Collins says the term ""enemy"" was removed from a draft statement in 2023.
People are packing Christmas boxes for children in Ukraine and Moldova.
As we have seen this week, satisfying everyone involved in the inquiry will be an impossible task.
John Healey says the UK is hunting Russian submarines as BBC News joins him on board a new RAF aircraft.

Applied Materials (AMAT) surged by 52% over the last six months, propelled not only by strong revenue and margin improvements but also by a remarkable increase in market confidence. 
The generative AI wave, which is expected to drive demand for more advanced manufacturing equipment, is seen as a key tailwind for the company. Besides this, better-than-anticipated Q3 results, and noteworthy analyst upgrades alleviated concerns regarding the slowdown in China. Let’s explore the factors contributing to the stock’s rise.
So what’s unfolding here? The stock price surged 52%, driven by a 3.5% increase in revenue, a 4.0% rise in net margin, and a substantial 38% jump in the P/E multiple. Let’s investigate the reasons behind these changes.
Before delving into the details of events that prompted the stock increase, let’s consider what market wisdom suggests: Investing in a single stock can be risky, but there is significant value in the broader diversified strategy we pursue with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. We ask you: Over the last 5 years, which index do you believe the Trefis High Quality Portfolio surpassed – the S&P 500, S&P 1500 Equal Weighted, or both? The answer may surprise you. Discover how our advisory framework can improve your odds.
Here Is Why Applied Materials Stock Moved
Our Current Assessment Of AMAT Stock
Opinion: At present, we consider AMAT stock to be fairly valued. Why? Take a look at the complete story. Read Buy or Sell AMAT Stock to understand the basis of our current perspective.
Risk: A practical method to assess the risk associated with AMAT is to review how severe its declines have been during previous market downturns. It fell approximately 76% during the Dot-Com Bubble, nearly 64% in the Global Financial Crisis, and about 55% during the Inflation Shock. Even less dramatic downturns like the 2018 Correction and the Covid Pandemic saw declines of over 40%. Strong fundamentals are important, but history reveals that AMAT can still experience significant losses when markets become unfavorable.
Consistently selecting winners is a challenging endeavor, particularly due to the volatility linked to a single stock. Instead, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has demonstrated a solid track record of outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four years. Why might this be? As a collection, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered better returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; offering a smoother experience, as highlighted in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Tesla (TSLA) has faced setbacks in the past. Its stock has dropped more than 30% within a period of under 2 months 8 times across different years, erasing billions in market value and negating significant gains in a single correction. If history serves as a reference, Tesla (TSLA) stock is not shielded from abrupt and steep declines.
Investing in a single stock can be precarious, but there is significant value in adopting a broader diversified strategy. If you are looking for potential gains with reduced volatility compared to holding a singular stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio (HQ) – HQ has surpassed its benchmark, which combines the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap index, delivering returns greater than 105% since its inception. Effective risk management is essential – consider what the long-term performance of a portfolio might look like if you included 10% in commodities, 10% in gold, and 2% in crypto alongside HQ’s performance metrics.
It certainly helps to alleviate risk if the fundamentals are robust. For insights on TSLA, read Buy or Sell TSLA Stock. Below are some pivotal numbers.
*LTM: Last Twelve Months
Examining Tesla’s previous market declines provides context for its risks. The correction in 2018 resulted in a 53.5% reduction from its peak, while the Covid pandemic witnessed an even greater decline of 60.6%. The shock from inflation was the most severe, with a drop of 73.6% from peak to trough. Despite having solid fundamentals and significant interest surrounding the brand, Tesla has not been insulated from considerable sell-offs under difficult market conditions. This serves as a reminder that no stock, irrespective of its popularity, is completely protected against substantial declines.
However, the risk extends beyond just major market crashes. Stock prices can decline even in favorable market conditions – consider events such as earnings reports, business updates, and changes in outlook. Read TSLA Dip Buyer Analyses to understand how the stock has bounced back from significant dips historically.
The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a selection of 30 stocks, boasts a history of consistently outperforming its benchmark, which includes all three indices – the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000. What contributes to this? Collectively, the stocks in HQ Portfolio have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; it has proven to be less volatile, as reflected in HQ Portfolio performance metrics."

Millennials, I've got yet another unfortunate piece of news about aging: The craft brewery-loving IPA guy is over. Craft beer sales are declining. Nobody cares about how many ounces of hops are packed into the can or about the subtle notes of honey and chocolate in that stout anymore, if they ever did in the first place. The stereotypical beer hipster is now a middle-aged dad who can't be too hungover for his kids' morning soccer practice.
Beer is getting back to basics. America's favorite beer is Michelob Ultra, a pretty whatever-tasting light lager with a bit of a health-conscious halo. One of the sector's bright spots is Garage Beer, a simple brew backed by the Kelce brothers. The drink of the summer was the Spaghett, also known as the hobo Negroni, which is a dash of Aperol in a bottle of a classic of the cheap beer lineup, Miller High Life. Even beer commercials are boring, especially after the backlash to a 2023 Bud Light microcampaign spooked marketers across the industry.
In short, beer is getting dumb again.
""Beer just doesn't have that same shine or that same relevance. It's just not as cool anymore,"" says Dave Williams, an alcohol industry analyst and consultant. ""These companies are reacting to that and saying, 'All right, we need to make beer fun.'""
It hasn't been a particularly fun time for the beer industry as of late. Health-conscious Americans are cutting back on drinking, and when they choose to indulge, they're increasingly opting for alternatives like ready-to-drink cocktails and THC drinks. The US beer market fell by 1.2% in production volume in 2024, according to the Brewers Association, which represents small, independent breweries. For craft brewers, the picture was bleaker, with production declining by 4%.
""Below-premium beer is doing better than premium, but neither is blowing the roof off,"" Williams says.
Many American consumers are struggling financially, causing them to trade down across a variety of items, including, in some cases, beer. Andrew Heritage, the chief economist at the Beer Institute, a trade association for the beer industry, tells me the below-premium economy segment, like a Miller High Life or Busch Light, is outperforming the overall trend, and that consumers are buying more from bulk retailers, such as Costco and Sam's Club.
""I think that's evidence of consumers looking for a lower price point,"" he says.
Earlier this year, a Brooklyn, New York bar owner told me he'd noticed his ""moderately employed regulars"" had switched from draft beers to the cheaper Miller High Life. Consumers are buying their alcohol in smaller sizes and quantities, too, picking up a six-pack instead of a 12-pack on the way home on a Friday.
Consumers aren't just changing their habits because of prices — tastes are changing as well. Craft beer was the hot new thing in much of the 2000s and 2010s. The boom brought a diverse set of flavors, options, and alcohol content levels. But craft beer maybe exploded a little too much. The space has become very crowded, and brewers' flavors and names have gotten so outlandish that the sheer number of choices can become overwhelming.
""The craft beer market is kind of reaching a point of oversaturation,"" says Garrett Nelson, an equity research analyst at CFRA Research. ""The last year and a half, there have been more breweries that have closed than new ones that have opened.""
Like broader ""foodie culture,"" craft beer isn't necessarily passé, but it isn't special, either. It's been very democratized— anyone can snap a picture of their meal and post it on Instagram — that it's lost its sheen. And it codes millennial, which is now firmly code for ""uncool.""
""It's not a cultural signifier in the way it used to be,"" says Kate Bernot, the lead analyst at Sightlines, which researches the alcohol industry.
The seemingly endless array of IPAs epitomizes the craft brewing industry — there's your hazy, your juicy, double, etc. But they're not for everyone. The alcohol content is often quite high — you can't really spend a day watching football, knocking back IPAs without being in for a wild time. Many people don't love their bitter flavor, either, and they'd prefer something that doesn't knock your socks off with hops.
""The American drinker has definitely shifted, if not toward blander stuff, necessarily, I would say much more straightforward stuff,"" says Dave Infante, who writes a newsletter about drinking called Fingers. Beyond beer, he points to ready-to-drink options, such as White Claw and High Noon, that are packaged in straight-to-the-point fruit flavors. Within beer, he mentions Michelob Ultra, which recently surpassed Modelo as America's top-selling brew. ""It's got an active lifestyle brand that gives it a big boost, and it isn't marketed aggressively on its flavor because it doesn't have a whole lot to offer there,"" he says. Ultra's marketing profile is now so ubiquitous that the other big guys are taking a run at it. In 2020, Miller Lite ran an ad campaign against Michelob Ultra, boasting that it has more taste for just one more calorie.
To stem the tide, more craft brewers are expanding their offerings in pilsners and lagers to capture a broader base of consumers and appeal to this back-to-basics palette. When considering the cost question, consumers tend to lean toward purchases that feel less risky, and lower-profile, more familiar flavors scratch that itch.
Simplicity is a key part of Garage Beer's success. The brand grew out of a craft brewery in the Midwest and has now struck out on its own. The light beer has a 4% ABV, comes in a white, unremarkable can, and is about as basic as you can get in its branding: the garage. It comes in two flavors — regular and lime. NFL star brothers Jason and Travis Kelce invested in Garage in 2024 and do ads for it that can be borderline boorish. Its ad spots include spoofs of old martial arts movies with Jason Kelce and partnerships with pro wrestlers doing body slams and grilling burgers.
""It's kind of going back to beer's roots a little bit, where it was endorsed by sports players, it's easy drinking, and it's for your garage,"" Sightlines' Bernot says. ""And I think it's a little bit of a course correction to the fanciness of craft and fan imports.""
Garage Beer reportedly reached a $200 million valuation and expects to produce 250,000 barrels this year, although that still makes it a tiny fish in the giant beer sea. (For some context, the US beer industry produces tens of millions of barrels annually.)
Andy Sauer, the CEO of Garage Beer, who acquired the company in 2023, tells me they hope to ""bring folks back to beer"" with a beer-positive, independent message. ""We don't take ourselves seriously in any way, shape, or form. We just try to be the dumbest beer on the internet, and that's sort of the spirit of what beer has been forever,"" he says.
Other small names, such as Montucky Cold Snacks and Easy Rider, are also making waves by tapping into nostalgic themes and retro aesthetics.
""The liquid inside the can is not very remarkable. It's fine. It's a commodity lager more or less,"" Infante says. ""Those products are mostly marketing, and they've been very successful.""
The beer industry is facing a conundrum that, although not existential, is nonetheless challenging. It needs to appeal to more consumers, especially as people grow wary of alcohol and have more drinking options when they do decide to imbibe. And any efforts to reach out to potential new drinkers come with some downsides in this fraught cultural moment: In 2023, Bud Light sent a few cans of beer to a transgender influencer as part of an attempt to reach that community, and, well, you probably remember where that landed. Companies need to duke it out with their competitors, but they're also afraid of land mines.
""It's a very competitive market right now because there's no growth, and so when there's no growth, it's a market share battle,"" says Gary Wilcox, a professor of communications at the University of Texas at Austin who's studied alcohol advertising.
Beer advertising isn't as vapid, silly, or sexist as it used to be — beer brands don't generally do the hot women running around in wet T-shirts thing like they did in the past. But it's not really thrilling, either. The themes are basically America, garages, barbeques, beaches, and gentle reminders to consumers that they exist. Bud Light's most recent Super Bowl campaign features singer Post Malone, comedian Shane Gillis, and former NFL star Peyton Manning at backyard parties, sitting in driveways, and screwing around on the porch. Over the summer, Miller Lite launched a commercial celebrating its 50th anniversary that highlighted its history as a ""backyard beer."" Beer's back to be positioned for regular guys — the group that's historically been viewed as pretty inoffensive in marketing.
Bernot says beer marketing is more ""boring"" than it's ever been. ""There hasn't been an iconic beer marketing campaign that I can think of in years,"" she says. Budweiser still has the Clydesdale horses. Corona has been using the ""find your beach"" slogan for more than a decade. Coors Light's schtick remains that it's … cold. ""We haven't seen beer lead the cultural and advertising conversation the way it used to,"" she says.
Taste-wise, beer's current trajectory could be considered a reversion to the norm. Your boomer dad wasn't knocking back sour beers after work, he was grabbing a Bud. Tastes going back from fancy to no-frills may have been somewhat inevitable. And with the marketing, the goal seems to be to make as few waves as possible, to say, ""Hey, we're here, but also, there's nothing to see here."" And the best way to do that, for now, appears to be for brands to do some dumbing down. The problem is, in working so hard not to offend or confuse, beer is losing some of the irreverence that once made it fun, too.

Google stock (NASDAQ: GOOG) has delivered solid growth, soaring 57% from approximately $160 in late April to over $250 today, a performance clearly backed by fundamental strength, among other developments. 
While we assert that there is little fundamental risk to GOOG stock, given its consistently strong operational performance and financial health, our machine-driven multi-factor evaluation suggests a different course.
Our primary concern lies with the current valuation. Due to the stock's Very High valuation, we rate it as Relatively Expensive. As a result, we believe it may be time to lessen exposure, as a pullback to around $230 is not beyond reach.
Below is our evaluation:
Investing in a single stock can be risky, but there is significant value in the more diversified approach we adopt with the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Allow us to pose this question to you: In the last 5 years, which index do you think the Trefis High Quality Portfolio outperformed – the S&P 500, S&P 1500 Equal Weighted, or both? The answer might surprise you. Discover how our advisory framework assists in improving your odds.
Let’s delve into details of each of the assessed factors, but first, for a quick background: With $3.1 Tril in market capitalization, Alphabet offers digital products and services including ads, Android, Chrome, Gmail, Maps, YouTube, cloud computing, and health technology across a variety of business segments.

This table demonstrates how GOOGL is expanding in comparison to the broader market. For more details see: GOOGL Revenue Comparison
This table illustrates GOOGL's profitability in comparison to the broader market. For further details see: GOOGL Operating Income Comparison
GOOGL exhibited a slightly better impact than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. Our assessment is based on both (a) the magnitude of the stock's decline and (b) the speed of its recovery.
Investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics."

Meta Platforms has a reputation for experiencing quick rallies. The stock has increased by over 50% in less than two months on six separate occasions, notably in 2012 and 2023. Moreover, it has risen more than 30% within a two-month timeframe eleven times, with significant movements occurring in 2013 and 2025. If historical patterns persist, forthcoming catalysts could propel Meta's shares to exceptional new peaks, offering investors considerable profits.
Single stock investments can be risky; however, there is significant value in a broader diversified strategy that we utilize with the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Should you opt for a single stock that appeals to you or construct a portfolio that is designed to succeed over various market cycles? Our data indicates that High Quality Portfolio has transformed stock-picking unpredictability into market-beating regularity. This portfolio is integrated into the asset allocation strategy of Empirical Asset Management – a wealth manager located in the Boston area and a partner of Trefis – whose asset allocation framework achieved positive gains during the 2008-09 period when the S&P experienced a loss of over 40%.
It certainly benefits to have solid fundamentals. For more information on META, read Buy or Sell META Stock. Below are some important key metrics.
When assessing META’s risk, it is evident that even robust companies can endure severe setbacks during challenging periods. In the 2018 market correction, META experienced a decline of approximately 43%. The slump caused by the COVID-19 pandemic led to a 35% reduction. The inflation shock proved to be the most impactful, with nearly a 77% drop from its peak to trough. These figures illustrate that despite META's strengths, it remains susceptible when the market faces significant downturns. Even the less extreme market declines resulted in considerable losses, underscoring the importance of considering risk when making evaluations.
However, the risk is not confined to substantial market collapses. Stocks can decline even when the market is performing well – consider events such as earnings releases, corporate updates, and changes in outlook. Review META Dip Buyer Analyses to understand how the stock has recovered from sharp declines in the past.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Every so often, you can find great free phone deals if you're willing to add a line or purchase a plan. For instance, Verizon is currently offering a free Samsung Galaxy S25 when you add a line with select new plans, representing about $800 in value.
We like the S25 for its small form factor, slim bezels, and the same powerful performance that comes with the rest of the Samsung Galaxy premium lineup. It also boasts a number of the latest Galaxy AI and Gemini features, and a fingerprint sensor.
This particular deal is for the 128GB version of the S25, though Verizon will also let you upgrade to the 256GB for just $1.66 a month as part of the deal. You can also get the deals in all four of the S25's colors: Icy Blue, Navy, Silver Shadow, and Mint.
If the S25 isn't quite what you're looking for, buyers can also upgrade to the Galaxy S25 Plus if they go with an Unlimited Ultimate plan, or Verizon is still offering the free Google Pixel 10 Pro deal we reported on last week.
Samsung Galaxy S25 (128GB): $799.99 $0.00/month for 36 months with select plans
Verizon's latest free phone deal is for the Samsung Galaxy S25, which is our top pick in the best small Android phone category. Normally priced at $800, the S25 offers a compact build without compromising on performance, though the sticker price is usually a bit on the expensive side. As such, those who are willing to start a new line with Verizon might want to consider this deal.
✅Recommended if: you want a free Android phone and would be willing to add a line to their Verizon plan, or switch to the carrier; you like a phone that's more compact but still has a good-looking display; you're looking for a phone with industry-leading performance speeds and a range of Galaxy AI and Gemini features.
❌Skip this deal if: you prefer a phone with a longer lasting battery than the S25 can offer with its 4,000mAh battery; you'd rather upgrade to a larger phone like the S25 Plus; you need something with fast charging.
The Samsung Galaxy S25 is our favorite small Android phone of the bunch, offering a vibrant 6.2-inch AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, as well as the smooth Android 15-based One UI 7. This deal is for the 128GB storage option, though the phone is also available in an upgraded 256GB configuration.
Performance on the S25 is supported by the powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor and 12GB or RAM.
Perhaps one of the largest downsides to the S25 is the limited 4,000mAh battery life, though it's still enough to get most casual users through the day without needing to charge. It also sports 25W wired fast charging and 15W wireless charging, though these aren't the fastest speeds on the market.

Eli Lilly stock (NYSE: LLY) is up 10% this month, a rise driven by strong clinical trial progress. This includes the announcement of positive Phase 3 results in October 2025 for its oral GLP-1 drug, orforglipron, specifically for diabetes management and weight loss. Investor confidence has further been boosted by speculation that orforglipron could receive expedited FDA approval.
See, LLY stock warrants your attention. Why? Because it offers monopoly-like high margins at a discounted price. Here are some figures.
Though revenue growth is beneficial, this is not merely a growth perspective. Pricing power and high margins yield consistent, predictable profits and cash flows, which mitigate risk and enable capital reinvestment. The market tends to reward this.
As a brief background, Eli Lilly offers innovative pharmaceuticals globally, including treatments for cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and autoimmune conditions like psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis.
But do these figures provide the entire picture? Read Buy or Sell LLY Stock to determine if Eli Lilly retains an advantage that still holds up under scrutiny.
Investing in a single stock can be risky, but there is significant value in a broader, diversified approach we adopt with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Trefis collaborates with Empirical Asset Management – a wealth manager based in the Boston area – whose asset allocation strategies produced positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P declined by more than 40%. Empirical has integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio into this asset allocation framework to provide clients with better returns and reduced risk compared to the benchmark index, resulting in a smoother investment experience, as illustrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
Here is how we select stocks: We target stocks with a market cap greater than $10 billion and then filter out those with high CFO (cash flow from operations) margins or operating margins. Furthermore, we only consider those stocks that have significantly dropped in valuation over the past year.
Below are statistics for stocks where this selection strategy has been implemented since 12/31/2016.
Nevertheless, Eli Lilly is not immune to substantial declines. It declined by 51% during the Global Financial Crisis and 43% during the Dot-Com bubble. Even during more recent challenges, such as the 2018 correction, inflation shock, and COVID-19 pandemic, it still faced declines between 18% and 22%. Therefore, despite solid fundamentals, this stock can suffer a significant blow when the market turns unfavorable.
Remember, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics."

Shares of Integer (NYSE: ITGR), a company specializing in the development and manufacturing of medical devices, saw a substantial decline of 32% on October 23, 2025. This notable drop was mainly due to the company’s updated financial projections for the remainder of 2025 and a disappointing preliminary forecast for 2026, both adversely affected by the slower-than-expected uptake of new products. This negative development overshadowed ITGR’s otherwise impressive earnings for the third quarter of 2025, which had either met or surpassed revenue and adjusted earnings per share expectations.
Even though there has been a recent downturn and some intrinsic issues that render the stock somewhat risky, we feel that ITGR stock is worth considering for purchase. The stock’s present Moderate valuationmakes it especially appealing from a valuation standpoint.
We reach this conclusion by comparing ITGR’s existing valuation to its operating performance over recent years, as well as its current and historical financial status. Our evaluation centers on essential factors: Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Resilience during downturns. This comprehensive assessment indicates that Integer presently displays a Moderate level of operating performance and financial stability.
However, if you are looking for potential upside with less volatility than holding onto individual stocks, you might want to consider the High Quality Portfolio. This portfolio has significantly outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has generated returns surpassing 105% since its inception. Why is this the case? In general, HQ Portfolio stocks have offered better returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; it has been less tumultuous, as evidenced by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
Based on what you invest per dollar of sales or profit, ITGR stock appears to be moderate in comparison to the wider market.
Integer's Revenues have shown some growth in recent years.
Integer's profit margins are lower than those of most companies within the Trefis coverage universe.
Integer's balance sheet appears fragile.
ITGR stock has performed worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during several recent downturns. Concerned about the effect of a market crash on ITGR stock? Our dashboard examines market crashes with an in-depth analysis of how the stock reacted during and after past downturns, as shown in market crashes.
In conclusion, Integer's performance across the aforementioned parameters is summarized as follows:
While ITGR stock may seem appealing, investing in a single stock without thorough analysis carries risks. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has surpassed its benchmark for all-cap stocks (the combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to yield strong returns for its investors. Why is this so? The quarterly adjusted mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks has offered a flexible approach to capitalize on favorable market periods while minimizing losses when the market declines, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.
The analysis reveals that Integer's operational performance and financial condition are moderate, paralleling its current moderate valuation. In our opinion, the market's response to the guidance was excessive, and the recent negative information seems to be overrated at the present stock price. While our assessment may be incorrect and investors might still be hesitant to accept even a 1x trailing revenue valuation multiple due to existing concerns about the stock, we are optimistic that ITGR is well-positioned to provide substantial returns for long-term investors who hold for 3-5 years."

3M (NYSE: MMM) shares have increased by 13% in the last week, and they are presently trading at $171.60. Our machine-driven multi-factor analysis indicates that it could be time to divest from MMM stock. We maintain a generally pessimistic outlook on the stock, and a price of $120 might be achievable. 
We believe there are several concerns regarding MMM stock considering its overall Moderate operational performance and financial status. Moreover, 3M continues to face a lingering overhang from litigation tied to its PFAS chemicals, while its organic sales growth has also remained weak. Also, taking into account its High valuation, we consider the stock to be Unattractive.
Below is our evaluation:
 
MMM stock has significantly increased recently, and we currently find it unattractive. While this may serve as a warning, there is considerable risk in depending on a single stock. Nonetheless, there is immense value in the broader diversified strategy we pursue with the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Trefis collaborates with Empirical Asset Management – a Boston-based wealth manager – whose asset allocation strategies provided positive returns during the 2008-09 timeframe when the S&P experienced a drop of over 40%. Empirical has included the Trefis HQ Portfolio within this asset allocation structure to deliver better returns to clients with reduced risk relative to the benchmark index; presenting less of a roller-coaster experience, as shown by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
 
Let’s delve into details regarding each of the assessed factors, but first, for a quick background: With $92 Bil in market capitalization, 3M provides industrial abrasives, ceramic transportation solutions, healthcare coding and food safety software, along with consumer bandages, braces, supports, and respirators across various segments.
[1] Valuation Appears High
This table illustrates how MMM is valued in comparison to the broader market. For more details see: MMM Valuation Ratios

[3] Profitability Seems Moderate

[4] Financial Stability Appears Very Strong
 
[5] Downturn Resilience Is Weak
MMM has performed worse than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. This assessment is based on both (a) the extent of the stock's decline and (b) the speed of its recovery.
2022 Inflation Shock
 2020 Covid Pandemic
 
 2008 Global Financial Crisis
 
The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has demonstrated a history of comfortably outperforming its benchmark, which encompasses all three – S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; demonstrating less volatility, as evidenced in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Meta chopped 600 employees from its Meta Superintelligence Labs group this week. Google is removing managers again. Broadcom cut staff recently, too.
These 3 companies have one thing in common: They are growing quickly and minting money from the AI boom. So why are they still shedding employees?
I asked Brad Gastwirth, global head of research and market intelligence at Circular Technology. He's been analyzing the tech industry for decades.
""The Meta cuts are a perfect example of AI working too well not failing. These aren't demand-driven layoffs; they're the result of a massive internal restructuring as AI changes the cost structure of tech itself.""
This is perfectly illustrated by another scoop this week from Business Insider's Jyoti Mann. She reported that Meta executive Michel Port recently told some employees that their jobs were being replaced by new automated processes.
Here's the rest of Brad's take, edited for clarity and length:
""In Meta's case, it looks like a consolidation and reprioritization issue. Meta has hundreds of separate AI initiatives spanning Llama, infrastructure, content moderation, recommendation systems, and ad optimization. The 600 jobs being cut are largely from overlapping research or support teams as Meta shifts from ""AI research mode"" to ""AI productization mode."" Once the models are trained and deployed, you simply don't need the same headcount to maintain that velocity, especially when internal tools are now automating much of the work engineers used to do manually.
Think of it like the moment after an airplane reaches cruising altitude: you need fewer hands in the cockpit. The heavy lift training, data labeling, model architecture is done. Now the focus is on efficiency, inference, and monetization.
More broadly, all the major AI players — Meta, Google, Microsoft, Broadcom — are demonstrating the same pattern. They're investing billions in infrastructure while trimming the human layers that are being displaced by those very systems. It's not layoffs because business is bad; it's because AI is doing exactly what it promised: automating middle-tier technical and operational roles.
If the industrial revolution replaced muscle, AI is replacing repetition and coordination. It's not that Meta or Google suddenly need fewer ideas; they just need fewer people to execute them.""

The current outlook for quantum computing stocks is undeniably interesting. D-Wave Quantum stock (NYSE: QBTS), for instance, has increased by over 200% this year, drawing substantial interest from retail investors. Additionally, institutional entities such as JPMorgan are also planning to invest in the industry.
Although these elements signal strong momentum, there have been inconsistent indications about official government interest. Earlier reports indicated that the Trump administration considered taking stakes in quantum computing firms; however, the US Department of Commerce has dismissed any ongoing discussions. Nonetheless, a representative from one of the quantum computing firms mentioned engaging with the government for funding, according to the WSJ report.
Clearly, there is significant momentum in quantum stocks. This brings us to the crucial question: Is this rally sustainable, or are we merely observing another speculative bubble?
Before we explore this topic, if you’re looking for an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like QBTS, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has significantly outperformed its benchmark—a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has generated returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster experience, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
The WSJ article about potential federal investment isn’t merely noise. When the government invests in emerging technology, it accomplishes two objectives: it validates the sector and offers a capital runway. We’ve seen this strategy with Intel, and more recently with the rare earth minerals firm MP Materials. If the administration follows through, quantum computing will suddenly become a priority with significant funding backing it.
Let’s specify the catalysts:
D-Wave holds the first-mover advantage in commercial quantum computing. While rivals like IBM and Google concentrate on gate-model quantum computing, D-Wave’s quantum annealing technique is already addressing real optimization challenges. They aren’t waiting for perfect qubits—they are delivering systems today. When the market transitions from research to commercial use, being years ahead in implementation provides a compounding advantage.
Let’s be clear: this is still a speculative investment. The mainstream commercial viability of quantum computing is likely years away. The technology may encounter unexpected challenges. Competitors could surpass D-Wave’s method. Revenue might not materialize as swiftly as proponents anticipate.
To explore our insights on this topic, see What’s The Downside Risk For D-Wave Quantum Stock? for additional details.
However, here’s the reality: you don’t need quantum computing to be fully developed for the stock to reach $60. You just require continued momentum on these catalysts and persistent market confidence in the trajectory.
Nonetheless, investing in a single stock like QBTS without thorough analysis can be perilous. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices) to deliver robust returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks has provided a reactive way to maximize benefits during favorable market conditions while minimizing losses during downturns, as outlined in RV Portfolio performance metrics.
D-Wave is situated at the crossroads of technological innovation, government interest, and institutional capital flows. The path to $60+ is not about quantum computing “winning”—it’s about D-Wave successfully commercializing while the market continues to hold excitement about the potential.
The catalysts are identifiable and trackable. Keep an eye on federal contract announcements, commercial customer acquisitions, technological demonstrations, strategic investments, market share data, and profitability metrics.
For investors willing to embrace risk, the asymmetric upside is tangible. Just keep in mind: so is the downside. This is a high-conviction play, not a core holding."

Over the past ten years, CVS Health stock (NYSE: CVS) has returned $31 billion to shareholders in the form of cash through dividends and buybacks. This shareholder-focused strategy has delivered exceptional results in 2025, with the stock posting a remarkable 81% year-to-date return, representing one of the most dramatic healthcare sector turnarounds after suffering a 42% decline in 2024 and demonstrating the company's successful navigation through post-pandemic challenges. 
CVS Health’s commitment to consistent income generation continues through its steady quarterly dividend of $0.665 per share, maintaining an annual dividend of $2.66 that yields approximately 3.64%, with the healthcare giant declaring its regular quarterly dividend in September 2025 payable to shareholders of record as of October 23, 2025.
The integrated healthcare services company demonstrated robust capital allocation discipline by repurchasing approximately 40 million shares in 2024 while distributing $3.3 billion in dividends, showcasing management’s balanced approach to returning cash while investing in strategic initiatives across its retail pharmacy, health services, and insurance segments. Let’s analyze some figures and see how this level of payout compares to the market's leading capital-return entities.
That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
It turns out that CVS stock has provided the 90th highest total return to shareholders in history.
Why is this important? Because dividends and stock repurchases offer direct, tangible returns of capital to shareholders. They also reflect management's trust in the company's financial condition and ability to produce reliable cash flows. And there are other similar stocks out there. Below is a list of the top 10 companies ranked by total capital returned to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.
Investing in a single stock can be risky, but taking a diversified approach has significant advantages. Strategic asset allocation and diversification enable you to remain invested. Did you realize that investors who exited the S&P in 2020 missed out on substantial gains that followed? Trefis High Quality Portfolio and Empirical Asset Management’s asset allocation strategy are set up to minimize volatility so you can stick to your plan.
To view the complete ranking, visit Buybacks & Dividends Ranking
What stands out here? The total capital returned to shareholders as a percentage of the current market capitalization appears inversely related to growth possibilities for reinvestments. Companies such as Meta Platforms (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) are growing at a much faster rate, more predictably, than others, yet they have returned a smaller portion of their market capitalization to shareholders.
This reflects the contrary aspect of substantial capital returns. While they are attractive, it prompts the question: Am I compromising growth and solid fundamentals? With this in view, let’s review some statistics for CVS. (see Buy or Sell CVS Health Stock for additional information)
However, CVS has not escaped significant declines. It fell by over 62% during the Dot-Com Bubble and by around 45% during the Global Financial Crisis. Even smaller pullbacks, such as the 2018 correction and inflation shock, saw declines of nearly 35-40%. The COVID-19 selloff was painful too, resulting in an approximate 30% dip. Strong fundamentals are essential, but during periods of volatility, CVS can still incur substantial losses.
But the risk isn't confined to major market crashes. Stocks decline even when conditions are favorable - consider events like earnings announcements, business updates, or changes in outlook. Review CVS Dip Buyer Analyses to see how the stock has rebounded from sharp declines in the past.

Lumen Technologies stock (NYSE: LUMN) jumped 11% on October 23, 2025, after the announcement of a strategic alliance with Palantir Technologies valued at over $200 million. This multi-year contract marks a critical juncture for Lumen’s evolution from a conventional telecommunications service provider into a cutting-edge technology infrastructure firm.
The partnership merges Palantir’s Foundry and Artificial Intelligence Platform with Lumen’s Connectivity Fabric, producing enterprise AI solutions that integrate sophisticated data analytics with resilient network infrastructure. This collaboration builds on Lumen’s earlier internal utilization of Palantir’s technology, which had already led to $350 million in cost savings during 2025.
The agreement establishes Lumen as a pivotal player in the AI infrastructure sector, addressing the urgent requirement for secure, fast data transfer across multi-cloud environments. Lumen CEO Kate Johnson referred to it as delivering “the holy grail for businesses” by uniting extensive data mobility capabilities with AI-driven intelligence.
In the sections that follow, we evaluate whether LUMN stock is now a Buy following this development. However, before we proceed, if you are looking for an upside with less volatility than maintaining a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has successfully outperformed its benchmark—a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indices—and has achieved returns of over 105% since its launch. Why is that? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks offered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; a smoother ride, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
Lumen trades at compelling valuation metrics when viewed against the wider market:
These metrics imply significant undervaluation, especially in light of the company’s strategic shift towards AI infrastructure services.
Lumen contends with ongoing revenue challenges that predate the AI transition:
The company’s financial performance shows worrying discrepancies:
Lumen’s financial stability poses considerable risks:
This leverage structure creates susceptibility during economic downturns and limits financial flexibility for growth investments.
Lumen’s stock has exhibited weak resilience during market downturns:
Investing in a single stock without thorough analysis can be perilous. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to yield strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mixture of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided an effective means to capitalize on favorable market conditions while mitigating losses in downturns, as elaborated in RV Portfolio performance metrics.
The Palantir partnership validates Lumen’s AI infrastructure strategy and offers tangible revenue visibility through the $200 million commitment. Together with the company’s ambitious $1 billion cost reduction goal by 2027, this positions Lumen for potential margin growth.
Despite the progress in transformation, significant risks are still present. Current analyst price targets average around $5, indicating that the stock at $8 may be overvalued in relation to fundamental metrics. The company’s debt load, declining revenues, and negative profitability pose considerable downside risks.
Investors should meticulously assess the potential upside of the transformation against the substantial operational and financial hurdles. Cautious investors might prefer to wait for more tangible signs of revenue stabilization and debt reduction before investing at current valuations."

Rigetti Computing’s stock is experiencing an upward trend following news that the U.S. government is contemplating investments in quantum computing firms. While the U.S. Department of Commerce has denied any active negotiations, the WSJ reported that a Rigetti representative confirmed the engagement with the government regarding funding. This possible federal investment serves as the primary catalyst: it’s not just theoretical policy, but a significant near-term driver for the stock.
In the following sections, we will explore the ramifications of this development for RGTI stock. That said, if you are looking for an opportunity with less volatility than investing in a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has significantly outperformed its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—with returns exceeding 105% since its launch. Why is this the case? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks generated superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; a smoother investment experience, as demonstrated by the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
If the U.S. government engages in investment, it achieves three key outcomes that immediately alter the investment narrative:
Government backing tackles the critical vulnerabilities of small quantum firms:
History offers a clear precedent for how stocks respond when substantial government funding or investment is confirmed. Federal support serves as a strong market validator, frequently resulting in immediate and significant stock appreciation.
The following case studies demonstrate this “Historical Playbook”:
Let it be clear: this continues to be a speculative venture. The mainstream commercial viability of quantum computing is still years away. The technology might encounter unforeseen obstacles. Rivals could outpace Rigetti’s methods. The revenue might not occur as swiftly as proponents anticipate.
Check out our insights on – What’s The Downside Risk For Rigetti Stock? – for further details.
However, here’s the reality—you don’t need quantum computing to reach full maturity for the stock to see higher valuations. All that’s necessary is consistent momentum from these catalysts and ongoing market belief in the trajectory. Most critically, a confirmation of government funding will serve as a significant catalyst for the RGTI stock.
Nonetheless, investing in a single stock like RGTI without thorough analysis can be hazardous. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has surpassed its all-cap stock benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to deliver substantial returns for investors. Why is this? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive strategy to capitalize on favorable market conditions while mitigating losses when markets decline, as outlined in  RV Portfolio performance metrics.
Government investment transforms Rigetti from a high-risk startup into a technology company of strategic importance backed by federal support. This transition unlocks institutional capital and expedites commercial growth, presenting a compelling setup for near-term momentum. Drawing on historical examples, the verification of government funding indicates a high likelihood of 2x growth for RGTI stock, potentially pushing its price beyond the $80 threshold. Although risks persist, the convergence of technical readiness and governmental interest suggests the market is finally giving serious attention."

Honeywell (NASDAQ: HON) stock has surged 6.8% over the last trading day and is now priced at $220.67. The recent gains are driven by a stronger than expected set of Q3 results, with adjusted earnings rising 9% to $2.82 per share. The company has also seen its order backlog jump 22%, led by strength in the aerospace technologies and energy and sustainability solutions divisions.
 
We think there is a balanced mixture of positive and negative aspects in HON stock due to its overall Moderate operational results and financial status. This corresponds with the stock's Moderate valuation, which is why we consider it to be Fairly Priced.
Below is our evaluation:
 
 
HON stock has seen significant growth recently and we currently assess it as fairly priced. This could come across as a warning, as there is a notable risk in depending solely on one stock. Nevertheless, there is substantial value in a more comprehensive diversified approach, which we utilize through the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Trefis collaborates with Empirical Asset Management – a Boston-based wealth management firm – whose asset allocation strategies provided positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P 500 plummeted by more than 40%. Empirical has integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio into this asset allocation model to deliver better returns to clients with reduced risk when compared to the benchmark index; resulting in a smoother investment experience, as demonstrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

37,2025-10-24,"Our Hackaday colleague [Bil Herd] is known for being the mind behind the Commodore 128, a machine which famously had both a 6502 and a Z80 processor on board. The idea of a machine which could do the job of both those processors in hardware while containing neither would have blown the mind of any 1980s computer enthusiast, yet that’s exactly what [Roelh]’s Isetta TTL computer does. It’s an extremely clever design whose targeted microcode allows the processor-swap trick, and since he’s brought it from prototype to production and has it running SymbOS since we last saw it, it’s time we gave it another look.
The video below the break shows the machine in action, with the Windows 95-like SymbOS GUI running a series of sound tests in the emulated AY-3-8910 sound generator, as well as a Lemmings-like game. It also runs Sinclair ZX Spectrum software, giving it access to a huge library.
We were lucky enough to see some of this in person when we encountered it for a second time on our travels during the summer — and it’s just as impressive in the real as it looks in the video. The feeling really hits you of how this would have blown away anything on the 8-bit market in 1985, made more impressive by the silicon in use being not too far from what was available at the time.
We’re told you can now buy one for yourself as a kit, and we’re looking forward to seeing it generate an ecosystem. We’re particularly curious as to whether that retargetable microcode could allow it to support other archetctures of the day.
Our original coverage can be read here, and we’ve also touched upon SymbOS.


This is what the Pi should have been, to train youngsters into computer tech (note: computer tech, NOT computer operations).
This is on my shopping list… :-)
R-Pi has GPIO and it can run Python. This thing must be programmed in some ancient IDE like Bascom.
Like I said…”tech”, not operation.
Isetta is not going to compete with any current technology, but it has the ability to teach the basic technology. CPUs have operated on the same principals for over 50 years…

39,2025-10-24,"Mobile gaming has become much more viable over the past few years. There have always been handheld gaming devices, but thanks to handheld gaming PCs like the Steam Deck and services that can stream games straight to your phone, even AAA games can be played on a device the size of a smartphone. Because of that, we've seen plenty of new game controllers for smartphones, like the new GameSir X5s, which is available now for $49.99.
The controller is designed to be wireless only, connecting to your gaming devices through wireless connections instead of a USB-C connector. At $49.99, it's also a whole lot cheaper than controllers like the Backbone One and Backbone Pro, which is the controller I've been using for my mobile gaming needs. But how well does it actually perform? I've been using the GameSir X5s to find out.
At its core, the GameSir X5s is similar in design to other mobile controllers for a smartphone or small tablet. It has a split design with space in the middle for your device along with an ABXY button layout. One neat touch is that you can actually swap those buttons out to create a different layout.
The buttons generally feel high quality and tactile, which is nice to see on a controller at this price point. The D-pad perhaps is the worst of the controls, but it's still clicky enough to not be overly distracting. All the other buttons and controls felt good though, including the Hall effect triggers and joysticks. Speaking of the joysticks, they are on the small side and definitely smaller than those on the Backbone Pro. I found that they still felt fine, but slightly larger joysticks might have been helpful.
One of the controller's big selling points is the fact that it can stretch pretty wide. It even has enough room for a Nintendo Switch if you want to ditch the Joy-Con controllers, though I'm not quite sure why you would. Perhaps even cooler is the fact that you can fit an iPad mini, making for a larger-screen gaming experience than you would get if you were just using a phone. The GameSir X5s has a USB-C port on the bottom of the left side to keep the controller powered up. Notably missing is a headphone jack, so you won't be able to use wired headphones when you're gaming with this controller.
As mentioned, the GameSir X5s is designed to be used with a wireless connection instead of USB-C in its typical handheld mode. Unlike controllers like the Backbone Pro, it doesn't have a USB-C connector that plugs into a device like a smartphone. Out of the box, it works over Bluetooth, but you can also use it through a more stable 2.4GHz connection if you buy a dongle that's sold separately.
You can actually use the controller through a wired USB-C connection too, by plugging a USB-C cable into the port on the bottom left of the controller and into your phone. Obviously, you can't have your phone slotted into the controller when you do so, as your phone's USB-C port will be blocked. The wired connectivity could be useful for other devices, though, like laptops or larger tablets.
In fact, with both wireless and wired connectivity, the GameSir X5s is positioning itself as a controller that replaces many of your other controllers -– though, of course, it won't replace your PS5's controller. This is an approach we've seen from others, but I still appreciate the versatility, especially at this price point. The controller is compatible with iOS, Android, and Windows devices, along with the Switch and Switch 2.
Because it's mostly wireless, the controller also has a battery built into it -– or rather, two batteries, with one in each side. According to GameSir, you'll get between eight and 12 hours of gaming time on a single charge, which is fine but not amazing. There are some other handy touches, too, like the fact that the controller automatically turns on when you extend it to put a phone in and turns off when you take your phone out, snapping back to its default position. You can also manually turn it on and off, of course, in case you want to use the controller without your phone inserted.
The controller also supports the GameSir FX5 cooler, which is also sold separately and frankly kind of silly, but it's an interesting concept for those who have a device that heats up. I find that the cooler adds a fair bit of bulk, especially if you use it with its battery module, but again, it's kind of a neat concept.
As you would expect, the X5s works with the GameSir app, which allows you to tweak settings including joystick and trigger dead zones, as well as perform firmware updates. Frankly, the app is bare bones at best. It's kind of poorly designed, especially for an app that you will likely be navigating with one of the brand's gaming controllers.
That said, I've been a little spoiled by the Backbone app, which is much better in terms of design, and clearly built to be actually used with a controller rather than touch. All that said, it's not really that big of a deal that the app isn't that great. You'll only use it to change the settings you need to change every now and then. It's not going to serve as a game launcher or anything like that, like Backbone tries to do with its app.
The GameSir X5s has a lot going for it. It's well-built with a solid feel and versatile connectivity. There might not be much that separates it from the growing pack of other mobile gaming controllers, but what does make it unique is the fact that it offers versatile connectivity and a high-end feel at this particular price point. Other options at $50 aren't really all that great, so if you're looking for a high-quality mobile controller on a budget, the GameSir X5s is worth considering.
Much of the competition at this price point comes from GameSir itself. For starters, there's the GameSir X5, which is the last generation model and has a USB-C connector. It's a solid controller, but you won't get the wireless connectivity that you get with the X5s. There are plenty of others that offer more for a higher price, but those...cost more.
Yes. It's an excellent game controller in its price bracket."

Quantum Computing Inc. (NASDAQ: QUBT), a firm that develops quantum-compatible chips and photonic hardware for high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity, experienced a 7% decline in its stock on October 22 due to a broader retreat in quantum stocks. This downturn is linked to uncertainties regarding changes in U.S. policy related to technology exports to China and Google’s announcement regarding Willow. Google’s Willow chip executed a repeatable algorithm 13,000 times faster than the finest supercomputers for a specific task. This achievement, known as “verifiable quantum advantage,” demonstrated that quantum systems can surpass classical computers in a consistent manner. Surely, the stock recovered the next day, up 7% to levels around $16. 
The current situation is this – despite the recent volatility, we believe QUBT stock carries too much risk at around $16. While the technology of quantum computing holds immense potential, this specific stock poses many warning signs. Before we discuss the reasons why investors should steer clear, if you are looking for potential gains with lower volatility than investing in an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has significantly outperformed its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has produced returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is this the case? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with less risk when compared to the benchmark index, providing a smoother ride, as illustrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
The uncomfortable reality about analyzing quantum stocks is that traditional fundamentals offer limited predictive insights when commercial applications are still several years away. Industry experts estimate that commercial quantum computing applications won't materialize until 2030 at the earliest, with Google's head of Quantum AI projecting a five-year timeline and more conservative forecasts pushing practical applications to 2035-2040.
Nevertheless, cash flow analysis is crucial within fundamentals, as these companies are consuming capital at unsustainable rates while generating minimal revenue. QUBT exemplifies this well – the company reported operating cash flow of negative $19 million against revenues of merely $0.3 million, which results in an OCF margin of negative 7,181%.
The core issue is straightforward: QUBT isn’t generating significant income. Revenue dropped 21.5% to only $0.3 million over the past year, with quarterly revenue nosediving 66.7% to a mere $61,000 in the latest quarter. To provide context, the company operates on a scale smaller than many food trucks, yet carries a $4 billion market cap.
QUBT is trading at astronomical valuation multiples, with a price-to-sales ratio of 8,790 compared to 3.2 for the S&P 500. For perspective, you are effectively paying nearly 9,000 times the company's annual sales to invest in QUBT – that’s not investing; it’s more akin to speculating on lottery tickets.
The company is losing cash at an alarming rate. QUBT reported a net loss of $76 million with revenues of only $0.3 million, leading to a net income margin of negative 29,054%. To illustrate the scale: for every dollar of revenue, the firm loses $290. Even at its peak, Tesla never reached such a level of inefficiency.
As mentioned earlier, the fundamentals won’t make much sense as the narrative revolves around speculation about the future of quantum and QUBT’s role in it.
QUBT does have one advantage: financial stability. The firm maintains a minimal debt load of $1.5 million in relation to its $2.1 billion market cap, resulting in a debt-to-equity ratio of just 0.1%. Cash constitutes 81.9% of total assets at $349 million, providing a significant cushion.
However, this cash position exists mainly due to recent fundraising efforts amounting to over $1 billion in 2025, including a $200 million financing in June. Without growth in revenue, this cash becomes a countdown to insolvency.
The stock's resistance to downturns is weak. During the inflation shock of 2022, QUBT plummeted 93.1% from peak to trough while the S&P 500 fell by 25.4%. In the 2020 COVID pandemic, it decreased 72.9%, contrasting with a 33.9% drop in the broader market. When markets become unsettled, speculative quantum stocks like QUBT are often the first to suffer severe losses.
Recent performance reinforces this trend, with the stock sinking 35% in just one week and declining 26.5% over the last month as investors gravitate toward established tech firms. For more insights, see our piece on – What’s The Downside Risk For Quantum Computing Inc.?.
Keep in mind, investing in a single stock without thorough analysis can be perilous. Take a look at the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has surpassed its benchmark of all-cap stocks (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to yield strong returns for its investors. Why is this so? The quarterly rebalanced blend of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks has created a responsive strategy that maximizes gains during favorable market conditions while minimizing losses during downturns, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.
Management indicates that significant revenue from photonic chip operations may be “12 to 18 months away,” yet this is more of a hope rather than a certainty. The quantum computing sector remains nascent, with commercial applications largely still in the realm of theory. Meanwhile, QUBT faces increasing loss estimates for 2025, ranging from 17 cents to 25 cents per share based on recent analyst revisions.
QUBT embodies a precarious combination of sluggish growth, exceedingly poor profitability, and weak downturn resilience, all despite solid financial stability. The firm is trading at valuations that are disconnected from fundamental reality, consuming cash much quicker than it generates meager revenue.
Why would you want to pay nearly 9,000 times sales for a company that loses $290 for every dollar of revenue when you could invest in profitable, growing tech firms at reasonable valuations? For example, check out our article on – Google’s Unloved Stock Finally Gets Its Due."

From Intercontinental Exchange: ICE First Look at Mortgage Performance: Mortgage Performance Remains Strong as FHA Foreclosures Emerge
 Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE) ... today released the September 2025 ICE First Look at mortgage delinquency, foreclosure and prepayment trends.

The data shows that overall mortgage performance remains historically strong, with both delinquencies and foreclosure activity remaining below long-term averages. While some shifts are emerging among government-backed loan segments, these trends largely represent a normalization of market dynamics rather than broad-based weakness.

“The mortgage market remains remarkably resilient, with mortgage performance continuing to hold up well,” said Andy Walden, Head of Mortgage and Housing Market Research at ICE. “Delinquency rates improved in September, and even as we see increases in activity among FHA loans, we’re largely returning to more typical levels following several years of artificially low foreclosure volumes.”

Key takeaways from this month’s findings include:

• Delinquencies remain well below pre-pandemic norms: The national delinquency rate fell by 2 basis points (bps) in September to 3.42%, down 6 bps from the same time last year and 58 bps below its September 2019 pre-pandemic level.

• Strength across delinquency bands in September: Both early-stage (30-day) and late-stage (90+ day) delinquencies improved month-over-month, as the vast majority of borrowers remain current on their mortgage payments.

• Non-current rates improved for most investors: The non-current rate (delinquencies plus active foreclosures) declined year-over-year among GSE (-3 bps), VA (-4 bps) and portfolio-held loans (-17 bps). FHA loans were the notable exception, rising by 44 bps from last year’s levels.

• Foreclosure activity is returning to normal ranges: There were 103,000 foreclosure starts in Q3 2025, a 23% increase from the same period last year, but 18% below Q3 2019’s pre-pandemic levels.

• Improving efficiency in resolution: The number of loans in active foreclosure rose modestly year-over-year (18%), yet overall foreclosure volume remains historically low, with Q3 foreclosure sales (21,000) at roughly half of 2019 levels. FHA loans account for the majority of that rise, making up 38% of active foreclosures, roughly half of the annual rise in foreclosure starts and 80% of the rise in active foreclosures. The resumption of VA foreclosure activity following last year’s moratorium is largely responsible for the remainder.

• Prepayments are edging higher: Prepayments rose by 8 bps in September to a 0.74% single month mortality (SMM) rate, a 15% increase from the prior year, as interest rates began to ease in August.

Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) is scheduled to announce its earnings on Tuesday, October 28, 2025. We anticipate Freeport-McMoRan Inc. will report quarterly revenues of approximately $8.3 billion, bolstered by increased realized copper and gold prices in addition to stable production volumes from its principal mining operations in North and South America, along with Indonesia. Nevertheless, profit margins may experience slight pressure due to escalating energy, labor, and input expenses, alongside persistent inflation in mining consumables and maintenance costs.
While enhanced copper and gold prices are expected to strengthen operating cash flow, high sustaining capital demands and ongoing investment in growth projects could restrict near-term profitability. A sustained focus on cost management and productivity enhancements will be vital to mitigate inflation-related challenges. In the medium term, expansion initiatives at Grasberg and new leach projects in the Americas, along with strong copper demand driven by the energy transition, create a favorable environment for earnings growth and cash generation in the upcoming quarters.
The firm currently boasts a market capitalization of $59 Bil. In the past twelve months, it recorded $26 Bil in revenue and was operationally profitable with $6.9 Bil in operating profits and net income of $1.9 Bil. Although much hinges on how the results compare to consensus and expectations, knowing historical trends may enhance your likelihood of success if you are a trader focused on events.

There are two approaches to do this: either grasp the historical probabilities and position yourself ahead of the earnings announcement, or analyze the correlation between immediate and medium-term returns following earnings and adjust your positioning accordingly after the earnings are disclosed. That being said, if you're looking for potential gains with less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative – having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns surpassing 105% since its inception.

Here are some insights on one-day (1D) post-earnings returns:
Additional data for observed 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns following earnings is compiled along with the statistics in the table below.
A relatively lower-risk strategy (although not effective if the correlation is weak) is to understand the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns subsequent to earnings, identify a pair with the highest correlation, and execute the appropriate trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D display the strongest correlation, a trader can position themselves ""long"" for the next 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Below is some correlation data derived from a 5-year and a 3-year (more recent) timeframe. It is important to note that the correlation 1D_5D refers to the relationship between 1D post-earnings returns and the followed 5D returns.
Discover more about the Trefis RV strategy that has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of all three indices: the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000), resulting in impressive returns for investors. Moreover, if you are seeking growth with a steadier experience than an individual stock like Freeport-McMoRan, contemplate the High Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P and achieved greater than 105% returns post inception."

Super Micro Computer (SMCI) stock deserves a place on your watchlist. Here's why – it is presently trading within the support zone ($45.52 – $50.32), price points from which it has significantly rebounded in the past. Over the last 10 years, Super Micro Computer stock attracted buying interest at this level 3 times and subsequently achieved an average peak return of 58.9%.
But is the price movement sufficient on its own? It certainly adds value if the fundamentals also align. For SMCI, read Buy or Sell SMCI Stock to determine how compelling this buying opportunity could be.
Investing in a single stock can be risky; however, a more diversified approach has significant advantages. If you are looking for potential upside with reduced volatility compared to holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio (HQ) – HQ has exceeded its benchmark, comprised of a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and the S&P midcap index, achieving over 105% returns since its inception. Effective risk management is crucial – consider what the long-term performance of a portfolio could be if you combined 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto with HQ’s performance metrics.
Here are some quick data points for Super Micro Computer that should assist in decision-making:
For quick background, Super Micro Computer offers high-performance modular server and storage solutions, which include servers, blades, racks, and networking devices aimed at enterprise data centers, cloud computing, AI, 5G, and edge computing markets.

That said, SMCI isn’t insulated from abrupt sell-offs. It experienced a 66% decline during the Global Financial Crisis, nearly 60% in the 2018 correction, and about 46% throughout the Covid pandemic. Even the recent inflation shock erased approximately 34% from its peak. Strong fundamentals are important, but during market downturns, SMCI can still suffer a significant blow.
However, the risk extends beyond major market crashes. Stocks may decline even when markets appear robust – consider events such as earnings announcements, business updates, and changes in outlook. Read SMCI Dip Buyer Analyses to see how the stock has bounced back from significant dips in the past.
The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has a history of consistently outperforming its benchmark, which includes all three – the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices.

AI is reshaping the media and marketing industries at warp speed — whether consumers like it or not.
Adtech and martech startups are raising millions of dollars from venture capital firms on the back of the AI wave.
Many of these companies are developing under-the-hood tech, like agentic AI tools designed to streamline marketers' workflows and boost productivity. Others are working on creative platforms that let marketers create ads and even virtual influencers using generative AI.
""We want to disrupt the traditional ad agency,"" Bolbi Liu, founder of AI adtech startup AdsGency, told Business Insider. In October, AdsGency announced it raised a $12 million seed round, led by XYZ Venture Capital.
Advertising agency giants are aware that they must embrace AI or risk being left behind. Large agency groups, from UK-based WPP to French holding company Publicis and US ad giant Omnicom, have pledged to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in AI over the next few years. Publicis is hunting for AI companies to acquire.
There's big money to be made. A Boston Consulting Group survey of 200 senior marketers, conducted this year, found that 71% of chief marketing officers plan to invest at least $10 million annually in generative AI over the next three years, up from 57% of respondents in the 2024 edition of the study.
Business Insider has interviewed the founders of startups building tools to disrupt advertising and marketing with AI. These founders shared the pitch decks they used to impress investors and raise venture capital.

US stocks shot up to fresh all-time highs to end the week, boosted by a late September inflation report that showed inflation accelerated less than expected. 
Consumer prices rose 3% in September, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Friday morning, slightly under economists' expectations of 3.1%. 
It's the first big economic data point investors have gotten since the government shut down at the beginning of this month, and the White House said on Friday that they shouldn't expect the October inflation data to be released on time in November. 
The S&P 500 topped 6,800 for the first time ever before paring the gain, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained nearly 500 points to notch its own all-time high. 
Here's where major stock market indexes stood at the 24 p.m. ET closing bell on Friday:
While the inflation rate remains above the Fed's 2% target, a 3% level indicates that tariffs are not leaking into consumer prices to the degree economists had feared.
""As odd as it may seem, the Fed will be happy with inflation staying around 3% for the next couple of months. The tariff passthrough generally remains muted, as the focus shifts squarely to a weakening labor market,"" said Olu Sonola, head of US economic research at Fitch Ratings.
Although the market did not get a jobs report for September, various indicators show that the labor market is cooling. Statistics from other sources, including ADP and outplacement firms, show that payroll growth is slowing and firing plans have risen at US companies.
Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management, said the latest economic data suggests that the bull market can continue for now.
""We understand that valuations are high and there are risks in the market, but with the Fed cutting rates — and this report does nothing to stop them from a 25-bps cut next week — and corporate profits continuing to increase, it's hard to see an interruption of this year's bull market.""
""Next year will bring new challenges,"" he continued, ""but we wouldn't advise getting in the way of the upward trend between now and year-end.""

A New HopeDisneyStar WarsTheatrical Cut 
The theatrical version of Star Wars: A New Hope, released as just Star Wars back in 1977, is seemingly being restored in 4k by Disney for a future release, according to new leaks. This version of George Lucas’ sci-fi blockbuster hasn’t been officially released by Lucasfilm since 2006, and that was a crappy transfer from a Laserdisc.
Over the last few months, rumors and leaks have been circulating online about Disney working on a remastered and fully restored version of Star Wars. Then, recently, video clips surfaced of this not-yet-officially-announced 4K restoration of the theatrical version of Star Wars. Those clips were promptly deleted, but leaked screenshots are still floating around and show new, highly detailed scans of A New Hope, and also The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, implying the entire OG trilogy is being restored. And the best part? The leaked information claims that these restorations are being done properly, using original film negatives and with an effort to preserve grain and color grading. This doesn’t appear to be a quick 4K AI upscale like we’ve seen in recent years.
This is a big deal because the last time Lucasfilm officially released the original theatrical version of the films, without all of Lucas’ special edition tweaks and changes, was way back in 2006. The DVD versions of Star Wars released back then included the original theatrical cuts as a bonus feature. Sadly, these were poorly transferred copies from the Laserdisc versions of the Star Wars movies. And the transfers on Laserdisc weren’t great either.
And while fans have done incredible work restoring the original cuts of Star Wars via projects like 4K77, these efforts have always been limited by having to work with old film stock and not having access to the original negatives or higher-quality prints. So it’s very exciting that Lucasfilm and Disney are properly restoring the OG cuts of the original trilogy, as they alone have access to the best source material around and the resources to pull this off.
We already know that Disney plans to bring back A New Hope to theaters in 2027, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the franchise. In the announcement of those plans, Disney didn’t specify which version would be shown. But it looks like it might actually be the long-awaited theatrical cut. If that’s the case, I’ll be there for sure. I also hope these versions get proper 4K UHD releases and are made available on Disney+.
Star Wars is one of the most influential films in history, and it deserves to be seen in its original form in the best quality possible. I’m happy that Disney, possibly looking to win back old fans, is finally doing this after decades of Lucas not caring. Now, let’s just hope this is all real and the company doesn’t fuck this up between now and release.

If I can give you one piece of advice now, it’s this: Don’t fear this talk of an AI bubble.
In fact, we should love it, because it’s set to hand us a shot at big dividends and gains—especially in closed-end funds (CEFs), which yield around 8% today and regularly hand us “dividend deals” that simply shouldn’t exist.
Our job: Buy, then ride along as CEF investors, who tend to be slowpokes compared to stock buyers, finally come around and bid our funds’ prices up. And we collect those rich dividends—often paid monthly—while we wait.
One CEF is giving us just such a nonsensical discount today: a 7.7%-payer called the Virtus Artificial Intelligence & Technology Opportunities Fund (AIO).
This one holds many key AI players, including Meta Platforms (META), NVIDIA (NVDA), Oracle (ORCL) and Microsoft (MSFT), as well as some companies that stand to gain as they work AI into their daily operations, like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Citigroup (C).
With most of these stocks skyrocketing, AIO should be pricey (“artificial intelligence” is right in the name, after all!). But it’s ridiculously cheap, trading at a 6.7% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of the AI stocks it owns).
And any selloff in AI stocks would make it even cheaper.
Which leads us back to the question on everyone’s mind: Are we in an AI-driven bubble? That’s critical to a buy of AIO now, so let’s dive in. We’ll start with an often-overlooked measure of where people’s heads are: a chart of common Google searches, in this case for the term “stock market bubble.”
You can see at the right side of this chart that the term has been gaining since hitting a low in September 2024. It’s now at its highest point in almost five years.
Why the bubble fears? Well, if you’ve been investing for a long time, your experience likely includes the popping of two major bubbles: the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s and real estate in 2008. A couple generations were traumatized by those events, and as a result, we’re now in a kind of “bubble” of bubble talk.
But are we really in an AI bubble? I’d say no. To start, let’s present the bubble case at its most dire: A Harvard academic recently suggested that, without AI investment, America’s GDP growth would’ve been a meager 0.1% in the first half of 2025.
There are a lot of problems with this argument. For one, it ignores the fact that a lot of AI investment is imported from abroad (Bloomberg estimates that imports account for about half of all AI investment), and GDP only measures productivity inside a country.
Bloomberg estimates that America’s 1.6% growth in the first half of 2025 would probably be more like 1.1% without AI investment. So, to be sure, AI is contributing much, but not most, of the country’s GDP growth, let alone all of it. Anyone trying to convince you otherwise is simply fear-mongering.
Don’t take the bait—especially when other indicators point to a stable economy:
This chart, for example, tells us that over the last year, Americans have been less delinquent on their credit cards than they were a year ago, and the overall percentage is pretty small—now about 3.1%, much lower than it was in the 1990s and 2000s.
But let’s keep the focus on AI for a moment longer, because it sets up just how out of step that discount on our 7.7%-paying AI fund, AIO, really is.
This chart comes from a recent Yale study showing that the share of workers exposed to AI hasn’t changed since the tech was released. “If AI were automating jobs at scale, we would expect to see a smaller share of workers in some of the jobs that are most negatively impacted,” the authors wrote. Yet this chart shows no change at all.
In other words, AI isn’t making Americans poorer. It isn’t taking their jobs, and it isn’t a bubble set to burst. That doesn’t mean it won’t turn into any of those things—but it is none of them now.
And that sets us up for a tempting trade.
If AI starts taking jobs or making Americans feel more uncertain, we should expect a stock pullback that would hit all sectors, including AI names like Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta and, of course, NVIDIA.
If AI doesn’t take jobs because the tech doesn’t wind up meeting expectations, AI investment will drop and, again, take down names like Google, Meta and NVIDIA.
Of course, everyone is watching these companies’ stocks like hawks, eager to sell at any sign of trouble. And that’s why, if we see a selloff driven by fear that any of the above-mentioned things will happen without data backing that up, they’ll be great buys.
That’s where AIO comes back into the picture. It’s a diversified play on AI that rewards investors with that healthy 7.7% dividend, which comes our way monthly.
It’s also a fund we know well at my CEF Insider service: We bought it in September 2020—long before AI was on investors’ radar—and rode it to a nice 23% total return (including its 6.4% dividend at the time we bought) in the following three years.
And, as I mentioned before, AIO is cheap today. In fact, it’s cheaper than it was during the April “tariff terror, ” if you can believe it. That’s a setup that makes no sense at all! Yet here it is:
We saw last spring’s deep discount flip to a premium by June. Now that premium has disappeared again, and AIO is back in bargain-bin territory.
That doesn’t mean it’s worth buying now—but it does mean AIO is more sensitive to sentiment than the AI stocks it invests in. If investors sell off AI stocks, they’ll sell off AIO aggressively, opening up an even bigger discount and boosting its yield (since prices move in opposition to yields). That will be the time to pounce.
Meantime, we’ll keep watching AIO and waiting for that bigger dividend, and discount, to materialize, thanks to the crowd’s overwrought bubble fears.

50,2025-10-24,"A recent uptick in prices has coincided with a sharp slowdown of hiring.
Consumer prices rose 3% in September compared to a year ago, extending a monthslong uptick that has sent inflation to its highest level since January, government data on Friday showed. The reading came in lower than economists' expectations.
The fresh data marked a slight increase from a 2.9% year-over-year increase recorded a month prior. An acceleration of price increases over recent months has coincided with a flurry of tariffs issued by President Donald Trump.
Beef prices soared nearly 15% over the year ending in September, data showed. Trump has set off outcry among some ranchers over a plan to import beef from Argentina in an effort to reduce U.S. prices.
Egg prices, a longtime symbol of rising costs, fell almost 5% in September. The price of eggs stands about 1% lower than where it was a year ago. The price of coffee has surged 19% over the past year, the data showed.
The White House touted the September inflation numbers coming in below economists' expectations on Friday, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt posting on social media that they were ""good news"" for American families. 
Leavitt also said on X that the ongoing government shutdown would likely result in no inflation report for October, ""which will leave businesses, markets, families, and the Federal Reserve in disarray.""
The data arrived more than a week later than originally planned, since the government shutdown has severely hamstrung the release of information about the economy.
The latest acceleration of price increases comes at a wobbly moment for the nation's economy. In recent months, inflation has picked up while hiring has slowed, posing a risk of an economic double-whammy known as ""stagflation.""
The economic conditions have put the Federal Reserve in a bind. If the Fed raises interest rates as a means of protecting against tariff-induced inflation, it risks tipping the economy into a downturn. On the other hand, if the Fed lowers rates to stimulate the economy in the face of a hiring slowdown, it threatens to boost spending and worsen inflation.
Last month, the Fed cut its benchmark interest rate a quarter of a percentage point, opting for its first interest rate cut this year in an effort to revive the labor market.
""It's a challenging situation when our goals are in tension like this,"" Powell said, but he added that the balance of risks had shifted toward greater concern over sluggish hiring.
Policymakers are widely expected to make an additional quarter-point cut when they meet next week, according to CME FedWatch Tool, a measure of market sentiment.
But an elevated inflation reading on Friday could give Fed officials pause, since a rate cut would increase the likelihood of a spike in demand that further drives up prices.
In recent months, tariffs modestly contributed to the uptick in overall inflation, analysts previously told ABC News, but overall price increases owed largely to a rise in housing and food products with little connection to Trump's levies.
Last week, President Donald Trump threatened 100% tariffs on all China-made goods starting Nov. 1 in response to restrictions placed on rare earth minerals. Beijing has publicly stood firm on the policy, leaving the two sides at an impasse with massive implications for the price of consumer goods imported from China.

Here is our perspective on why Light & Wonder (LNW) stock merits attention as a value investment. It is presently trading approximately 32% lower than its 1-year peak and is also trading at a PS multiple that is below the average from the past 3 years.
 
The decline in Light & Wonder’s stock is primarily due to mixed earnings reports and the company’s plans to delist from NASDAQ and list only on the Australian Securities Exchange.  
Nevertheless, it possesses sound fundamentals for its level of valuation.
 
As a brief background, Light & Wonder offers technology-driven products and services for the gaming and lottery sectors, including gaming machines, lottery offerings, player loyalty programs, and interactive marketing initiatives worldwide.
Investing in a single stock can be risky; however, there is significant value in the broader diversified approach taken with the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Additionally, consider what the long-term performance of your portfolio could look like if you integrated 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto with equities.
But do these figures provide the complete picture? Review Buy or Sell LNW Stock to determine if Light & Wonder still possesses an advantage that stands up upon further scrutiny.
Stocks Like These Can Outperform. Here Is Data
Below are statistics for stocks with the same selection strategy applied between 12/31/2016 and 6/30/2025.
But Consider The Risk
That being said, LNW is not exempt from significant declines. It dropped around 74% during the Global Financial Crisis and fell 76% in the 2018 correction. The Covid pandemic impacted it even more severely, bringing it down by approximately 86%. The inflation shock also resulted in a more than 53% decline. Thus, while robust fundamentals exist, abrupt market fluctuations can still take a considerable toll.
However, the risk is not confined to major market collapses. Stocks may decline even during favorable market conditions — consider events like earnings, business updates, or changes in outlook. Review LNW Dip Buyer Analyses to understand how the stock has bounced back from sharp declines previously.
The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which consists of 30 stocks, has demonstrated a history of consistently outperforming its benchmark that includes all three indices — the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000. What accounts for this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with reduced risks compared to the benchmark index; it was less volatile, as demonstrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Although Dell Technologies has experienced a 17% increase in the past month, its competitor Hewlett Packard Enterprise might be a more favorable option. Regularly assessing alternatives is fundamental to a robust investment strategy. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) shares demonstrate superior revenue growth during key periods, enhanced profitability, and a relatively lower valuation compared to Dell Technologies (DELL) shares, indicating that investing in HPE could be more beneficial.
Investing in a single stock can be risky, but a broader diversified approach holds significant value. If you're looking for growth with less volatility than owning an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio (HQ) – HQ has outperformed its benchmark – a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap index, resulting in returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Effective risk management is crucial – consider how the long-term performance of a portfolio could look if you mixed in 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto alongside HQ’s performance metrics.
DELL operates in segments such as infrastructure, client devices, and VMware, providing desktops, workstations, software, as well as multi-cloud, networking, security, and digital workspace solutions. HPE offers data solutions, general and workload-optimized servers, along with wired and wireless networking hardware like Wi-Fi access points, switches, routers, and sensors.
See additional revenue details: DELL Revenue Comparison | HPE Revenue ComparisonSee more margin details: DELL Operating Income Comparison | HPE Operating Income Comparison But do these figures provide the complete picture? Read Buy or Sell HPE Stock to determine if Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s advantage holds water or if Dell Technologies still has a winning strategy (see Buy or Sell DELL Stock).

Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE), a prominent provider of data solutions, servers, and networking hardware, has witnessed its stock grow by over 50% in the past six months, in contrast to the S&P 500’s 27% increase. The momentum is being fueled by a mix of strategic restructuring, initiatives favoring shareholders, and growth in AI and cloud infrastructure.
To begin with, HPE is revolutionizing its operations through consolidation and innovation. The firm has integrated Juniper Networks’ services into its networking division and has established a Cloud & AI segment, equipping itself to meet the demand in rapidly expanding enterprise IT fields. Additionally, HPE is distributing capital back to its shareholders. A 10% increase in dividends and a $3 billion expansion in share repurchases signal confidence in the balance sheet while bolstering the stock price. Furthermore, the stock is trading at a relatively modest valuation. With a price-to-sales ratio of 0.9x, compared to 3.3x for the S&P 500, HPE may experience growth from multiple expansion if it maintains execution and growth trajectories. Lastly, the revenue growth momentum is increasing. In the last year, revenue surged by 14%,reaching $33 billion, while the latest quarterly revenue grew by 18.5% year-over-year to $9.1 billion. This expansion, driven by the demand for hybrid cloud and AI-compatible infrastructure, provides HPE with a robust foundation to build upon.
Nevertheless, investing in a single stock carries risks. You might also consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has significantly outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has generated returns exceeding 105% since it began. What is the reason for this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have achieved better returns with lowered risk compared to the benchmark index, steering clear of substantial fluctuations, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Furthermore, take a look at – Bath & Body Works Stock To $10?
We are convinced that HPE is well-prepared to capitalize on three significant long-term trends:
Although margins currently fall short of the S&P 500 average, operating income of $2 billion and operating cash flow of $2.5 billion provide HPE with the flexibility to invest in higher-margin opportunities while rewarding its shareholders.
HPE’s historical recoveries underscore its capability to rebound strongly after experiencing market stress:
This resilience is indicative of both investor confidence and the company's capability to navigate downturns and resume growth.
With a current price of approximately $23, if HPE is able to sustain steady revenue growth and slightly increase margins, a revaluation towards 1.3x–1.5x sales could elevate the stock to the $33–$38 range — equating to an upside of roughly 30%–50% from present levels.
This is not just optimistic speculation. It is rooted in historical valuation ranges and the company’s ongoing strategic initiatives, including the integration of Juniper Networks and the growth of its AI-driven and hybrid cloud divisions. HPE presents an increasingly rare opportunity in today's market — growth potential at a value multiple.
Of course, there are still risks to consider. Intense competition in the AI server market — particularly from companies such as Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) — is significant, and successful integration will be crucial. Yet, at current valuations, the risk/reward dynamic seems to favor investors.
If you prefer a more diversified strategy, you may want to look into the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to provide strong returns for investors. What factors contribute to this? The quarterly rebalanced composition of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks affords a flexible strategy to leverage favorable market conditions while mitigating losses during market downturns, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics."

U.S. media mergers always follow the same trajectory. Pre-merger, executives promise all manner of amazing synergies and deal benefits. Post-merger, not only to those benefits generally never arrive, the debt from the acquisition spree usually results in significant layoffs, lower quality product, and higher rates for consumers. The Time Warner Discovery disaster was the poster child for this phenomenon.
Our good friend Cory Doctorow wrote a whole new book about it. 
After paying Trump his $16 million bribe, Trump’s billionaire friends, the Ellisons, recently finalized their $8 billion merger of CBS and Paramount over the summer. And, like clockwork, the new, bigger, shittier company is getting close to laying off thousands of employees:
“Major job cuts have been expected even before the Skydance Media-Paramount Global deal closed, as part of Ellison and his team’s goal of slashing upwards of $2 billion in costs. Previously, the company had been targeting layoffs by early November. The new round of cuts is expected to eliminate around 2,000 jobs in the U.S., with additional layoffs internationally.
This new round of layoffs comes after CBS/Paramount fired around 3.5% of its staff back in June in preparation for the merger. And it comes as the Ellisons are throwing around money in media like never before, including $7.7 billion to grab MMA rights, a whopping $150 million for Bari Weiss’ shitty right wing blog, and billions more to nab partial control of TikTok. 
I’m sure the longstanding employees at CBS and Paramount are particularly thrilled about the Ellisons overpaying for Bari Weiss’ blog, then promoting a woman with no real experience in journalism to be the new head of CBS News. As we’ve noted, that effort to bring even more right wing trolling and billionaire-ass kissing to a fairly saturated media market is likely to be a major headache. 
The Ellisons, in their bid to dominate U.S. media, also have their eye on acquiring whatever is left of Time Warner, which is expected to cost them somewhere around $60 billion. Historically these kinds of media domination plays never end well (just ask AT&T), so you can expect significantly more layoffs as this weird combination of fail-upward brunchlords and nepobabies try to navigate a tumultuous market they don’t really understand. 
It used to be that companies planning for harmful, pointless mergers had to at least make a fleeting effort to justify the pointless consolidation. But during the Trump era all you have to do is kiss the idiot king’s ring and any and all pointless consolidation gets the green light. All of the costs of those harms will, of course, be borne by consumers and employees in the months and years to come. 
And because we’ve let our journalism and media consolidate in the hands of just a few billionaires — the media’s coverage of itself generally doesn’t honestly reflect any of this, propping up billionaire efforts to keep making the same mistakes over and over again for some tax cuts and a temporary stock boost.

The layoffs? It’s the fault of the raising unemployment rate.
The unemployment? It’s the fault of raising tariffs.
The tariffs? It’s the fault of the shutdown.
The shutdown? It’s the fault of Democrats.
Damn Democrats.
Looks like I’m about to start saving a lot of money by not bothering with YouTube TV and other TV streaming services pushing out nothing but right wing Ellison required trash.  I’ll just stick to streaming past TV shows and movies that I enjoy and not give my money to companies propping up the enshittification of TV and media in this country.
Late-stage capitalism is gonna late-stage capitalism. Trump is just adding kerosene to the fire.

Wall Street bank JPMorgan (JPM) upgraded Coinbase (COIN) to ""overweight"" from ""neutral"" and raised its price target to $404, citing new monetization opportunities and reduced risks that make the crypto exchange appear more attractive compared to its peers. 
The shares were about 4% higher in early trading, around $332.
The bank highlighted two key catalysts: a potential Base token and enhanced USDC payouts.
JPMorgan analysts said that Coinbase is exploring a token for Base, its Layer 2 blockchain launched in August 2023, which has grown into one of the largest in the ecosystem. 
A token could allow Coinbase to capture more of Base’s growth, with the bank estimating a possible $12 billion to $34 billion market cap and up to $12 billion in value accruing to Coinbase. The move, JPMorgan said, could spur development, community participation and long-term infrastructure growth.
The bank's analysts also noted Coinbase’s efforts to better monetize USDC by offering yields to customers through its Coinbase One subscription service. By segmenting users and offering 4% returns to subscribers, Coinbase could add about $1 per share in annual earnings, JPMorgan said.
While competition from decentralized exchanges (DEXs) remains a risk, the analysts said market share between DEXs and centralized exchanges has stabilized. It added that Coinbase’s integrated model, spanning brokerage, market making, exchange and custody, should help sustain profitability even if fees decline.
JPMorgan valued Coinbase at 50 times projected 2027 earnings, factoring in $4 billion from a potential Base token, and set a December 2026 price target of $404.

Key Takeaways
- Government publishing numbers
- Gold skids again
- Intel with shining report
You read the headline correctly, despite the government shutdown, the market gets some long-desired data today. We have the release of CPI data today at 8:30 Et this morning.  Putting this in some perspective, there may not be the usual excitement around the number as at this point there have been few other numbers to help put it in comparable terms.  The real interest comes from market participants around the fact that we are getting some numbers. When the number comes out, Investors will still be watching closely to understand the pace of accelerating or decelerating inflation.  This of course will be a data point for the Fed as they continue to get pressured to cut rates.  Speaking of the government shutdown, it is now in week 4, all indications are that the economy has not been terribly affected yet.  However, let’s not think that it can last and we have to have an agreement soon to get the assistance programs needed and paychecks going out to folks.  I ask that you Thank those government employees, be it TSA or anyone else, that is showing up to work every day and not receiving a check.  They are truly great people, doing the right thing during a crisis. 
The market does come off some momentum with stocks rising on Thursday with President Trump announcing that he would meet with Chinese leader XI Jimping next week in Asia. This was welcome news as the meeting has been anticipated for weeks and can hopefully mitigate the tension that seems to have raised over the last few months around the tariff issue.  This was well received and turned the market around; we saw the S&P 500 up more than 0.5%, the Nasdaq up just under 1%and the Dow Jones up 0.3%.  The other announcement was a bit more inflationary in nature, in that the President announced new tariffs on Russia’s two biggest Oil Companies, this had the effect of sending Oil prices higher but did help the Energy related stocks in that Exxon Mobil, British Petroleum and Chevron all advanced.  The intent of these tariffs was to deter buying from these companies and specifically aimed at India and China. 
Some of the other stories to follow that came out of yesterdays action include, American Airlines shares jumped after they raised their yearly numbers, it will be interesting to see if Oil prices can stay calm and help them on this journey.  In positive for the economy, it was reported that in September home sales rose to a seven year high as we saw declining mortgage rates.  Gold was able to dust itself off (pun intended) and have an up day after a violent two-day skid.  However, the commodity is down almost 1,5% in premarket trade.  TSLA was a stock that had quite a turnaround after being hit hard early on close to their loss to only 1.5% on the day.  This after reporting a 37% decline in third-quarter net income. 
As we head into the day Friday, the primary stock to watch is Intel.  The stock is higher by more than 7% in pre-market trading as the stock surged on a Revenue beat.  This is quite a turnaround in a year that was much beleaguered.  We also saw earnings this morning from Proctor and Gamble, they talked of sales rising and stock was up slightly.  The other widely held stock reporting earnings was HCA Healthcare, up over 3% in pre-market trading as they lifted their outlook based on a very good quarterly report today.   The good news is that we have plenty to trade today and it will be exciting to have government inflation indicator numbers back in the game.  As we always remind you, keep to your trading plan and keep your position sizing in check"

Alt5 Sigma, which bet its future on a Trump family crypto venture and has since seen its stock price plummet 74%, suspended its CEO last week with pay but without a public explanation, according to a new filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Alt5 Sigma’s board suspended CEO Peter Tassiopoulos on Oct. 16, disclosing the move in an SEC filing six days later that provided no explanation.
Tassiopoulos was installed as CEO in September 2024, with the firm’s president and chair, Tony Isaac, saying at the time Tassiopoulos’s experience would be vital to unlocking shareholder value and exploring new markets. 
Tassiopoulos’s suspension came two months after Alt5 Sigma tied its fortune to a Trump-connected crypto venture, building a treasury of World Liberty Financial’s digital tokens.
Jonathan Hugh, s chief financial officer since August, was named acting CEO while continuing in his current role.
The stock (NASDAQ: ALTS) closed at $2.19 the day of the suspension, down 74% from $8.42 when the deal was announced; it closed Thursday at $2.07.
That’s unclear. The SEC filing provides no explanation and neither Alt5 Sigma or World Liberty Financial responded to inquiries. Tassiopoulos could not be reached for comment.
In August, Alt5 Sigma announced plans to raise $1.5 billion and build a treasury of $WLFI tokens from World Liberty Financial, a crypto venture Trump and his three sons co-founded. A Trump-affiliated LLC owns around 38% of World Liberty Financial, as well as 22.5 billion $WLFI tokens and is entitled to roughly 75% of the proceeds from token sales. The digital token does not represent ownership in any company and is not backed by any underlying assets; it just allows holders to vote on decisions affecting the project. The deal included a private placement, with World Liberty Financial picking up 1 million shares in Alt5 Sigma priced at $7.50 (plus warrants for 99 million more). But rather than cash, it paid for them with $750 million worth of $WLFI tokens, priced at $0.20 each. World Liberty Financial cofounder Zach Witkoff was named chair of Alt5 Sigma’s board, and Eric Trump was supposed to join Alt5 Sigma’s board as a director. But two weeks later, Alt5 Sigma disclosed that Eric Trump would instead be a board observer, as a way of complying with Nasdaq rules. The token was trading at $0.14268 at 5 p.m. EDT Thursday, according to Coin Gecko, valuing Alt5 Sigma’s stake at $1 billion. The market cap of the company, meanwhile, was just $227 million.
Whether Alt5 Sigma discloses a reason for the suspension and if Tassiopoulos returns or is permanently replaced. Also, any potential impact on the company’s World Liberty Financial partnership, and price movements for Alt5 Sigma’s stock and $WLFI.
What’s now Alt5 Sigma was founded as an appliance retail and recycling business in 1976 and incorporated as On-Line Communications Inc. in 1983. By 1989, the firm was christened Appliance Recycling Centers of America, Inc, changing its name yet again in September 2019 to JanOne Inc., and expanding into the biotech sector. The firm took its current name in 2024 when it acquired Alt5 Sigma Inc., a blockchain fintech provider founded in 2018. World Liberty Financial launched in September 2024, presenting itself as a decentralized finance platform “inspired by the vision of Donald J. Trump.” It began selling non-transferable $WLFI tokens the following month to accredited and foreign investors, initially pricing them at $0.015, with a second round at $0.05. In July, investors voted to allow early holders to sell a portion of their tokens, though founders—including the Trumps—remain restricted. As of Oct. 23, the tokens were trading at more than double what many early investors paid, but down about 61% from their high on the public market.
Before joining Alt5 Sigma, Tassiopoulos was CEO of Sphere 3D Corp., a data-management firm. In June 2021, while he headed that company, it announced plans to merge with Gryphon Digital—a deal that collapsed in April 2022. Like Tassiopoulos, Gryphon Digital would also go on to link up with a Trump crypto project: in September 2025, it merged with American Bitcoin, a crypto-mining venture cofounded by Eric Trump with Donald Trump Jr. as a major shareholder. When the combined entity started trading, Eric Trump briefly achieved billionaire status.
In September 2019, around the time the company changed its name to JanOne, it hired former Fox News personality Eric Bolling as president and board chair with a $550,000 salary and signing bonus of shares worth $1 million, according to SEC filings. He lasted 11 months before resigning from those roles but staying on as a director. He left the board altogether in November 2020. 
Forbes pegged Eric Trump’s net worth at about $750 million, up from around $40 million a year ago. Much of his wealth comes from his 7.5% stake in American Bitcoin, a crypto mining venture he co-founded that went public in September.

My first trip to Southeast Asia in 2010 was a revelation. As a young South African, my global travels were just beginning, but the vibrant cultures of Thailand and Malaysia left a lasting impression.
That journey sparked a desire to see the world, and 15 years and 38 countries later, I've come to a simple conclusion: Nowhere else offers the same exotic, compelling diversity as Southeast Asia. I returned to this part of the world again and again, often on my own, and eventually, last year, made Thailand home.
Through years of solo travel, I've learned that every country has its highlights, but some destinations become lifelong loves while others lose their spark. Based on my experiences, here are three cities I recommend to fellow travelers, and one that, sadly, I now suggest skipping.
Bangkok may claim the title of the world's most visited city, but Phuket offers the most quintessential Thai experience. It was the first Asian destination I visited, and it left a lasting impression that ultimately led me to call it home.
Despite its reputation as a tourist magnet, I've never tired of it. For a solo traveler, Phuket's variety is what makes it special. You can find peace in the sleepy jungle villages of Kamala, dive into the electric nightlife of Patong, wander the colorful Sino-Portuguese shophouses of Phuket Old Town, or island-hop to nearby Koh Phi Phi.
Over the years, Phuket became my sanctuary. During times when I needed a reset — including the tail end of the pandemic, when my mental health was in shambles — it was my solo go-to. I found peace and serenity here without sacrificing Thai culture, cuisine, or entertainment.
Luang Prabang had long been on my bucket list, and when I finally visited, it exceeded all my expectations. This UNESCO World Heritage town, where the intersection of the Mekong and Nam Khan rivers meet, offers a perfect balance of spiritual serenity, natural beauty, and cultural richness.
As a solo traveler, I found a much-needed break from my manic city life. The town's café scene makes it an ideal spot for digital nomads to work and connect. One of my most memorable moments was taking a slow boat on the Mekong.
During my 2018 visit, I woke before dawn to witness the sacred Alms Giving Ceremony. Hundreds of saffron-robed monks silently processed through the streets as locals and visitors donated food. The ritual is believed to generate positive karma for this and future lives.
My highlight, though, was swimming in the turquoise waters of Kuang Si Falls, a series of cascading pools deep in the jungle and one of the most stunning natural sites I've ever seen.
Vietnam is rapidly gaining popularity as a travel destination, even surpassing Thailand for the first time this year in attracting the lucrative Chinese tourism market. Its southern capital, Ho Chi Minh City, is a chaotic, charming metropolis that won my heart instantly.
In a city this lively, I've never felt alone. On my first visit, I joined a street food walking tour that included stalls where I got to cook my own dishes. I even learned to make bánh xèo — a savory crepe filled with shrimp or pork and bean sprouts, then wrapped with fresh herbs.
The city also offered practical perks for long-term travelers. Vietnamese medical clinics operate at a high standard for a fraction of Western prices. I had dental work, saw specialists, and even got Botox there. It was all affordable and excellent.
When I first visited Kuala Lumpur, as part of my first trip to Southeast Asia, I fell in love with its gritty yet luxurious energy. I explored the city alone on foot, shopped, and partied so hard I almost missed my flight. So when I returned in 2023, I was shocked. The KL I knew felt like a shell of its former self.
Lately, Malaysia has been leaning more conservative, tightening rules around concerts and nightlife in line with cultural and religious values. Some international shows have been canceled, and bars face stricter limits on serving alcohol and late-night hours.
I respect local customs, but I wasn't prepared for how much things had changed. After five years living in the Middle East, I actually found Kuala Lumpur to feel more restrictive than Dubai or Abu Dhabi — something I never expected.
The gay clubs I remembered were gone. I found one remaining drag bar, but the atmosphere was subdued. Venturing out alone, I felt bored and disconnected, as if I were on a different continent. 
I'm grateful I experienced the city when I did, but today it feels like a hollow echo of its vibrant past — one I don't plan to revisit anytime soon.

Happy Friday! Most people look forward to the weekend. For me, it's another excruciating Sunday watching the New York Jets. Luckily, I think I have a solution. I just need private equity's help.
In today's big story, a massive FBI investigation involving illegal sports gambling and rigged poker games rocked the NBA.
What's on deck:
Markets: Blackstone's Steve Schwarzman just tried to squash the ""cockroach"" claim about private credit.
Tech: Here's how Meta told some employees their jobs were being replaced by tech.
Business: These Fed workers could ultimately hold the key to ending the government shutdown. They just want to do their jobs.
But first, wanna bet?
If this was forwarded to you, sign up here.
The Mafia. The NBA. Poker games. Sports gambling.
What sounds like Martin Scorsese's next movie is the basis for a sweeping FBI investigation.
Miami Heat player Terry Rozier and Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups were arrested yesterday over their alleged involvement in illegal sports gambling and rigged poker games, according to two separate but related federal indictments that were unsealed.
The cases, which involve dozens of defendants spread across multiple states, illustrate the delicate relationship sports leagues have with the sportsbooks that pay them millions in sponsorship deals but also pose a potential reputational risk.
And some experts believe this is just the beginning, writes BI's James Faris. Starting next month, the NCAA will allow college athletes to bet on professional sports, which could lead to even more gambling-related issues.
So what happened?
According to one of the indictments, Rozier and others allegedly shared non-public information about players' injuries or teams' lineups. A group of bettors used that info to place wagers. In some cases, there were ""faked injuries to fraudulently manipulate bets on games,"" NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said.
In short, insider trading, but make it sports betting.
This isn't the NBA's first brush with a scandal since the federal ban on sports gambling was lifted. Back in 2024, Jontay Porter was banned for life from the NBA for gambling violations. (Porter was also mentioned in the most recent indictment.)
""This is the tip of the iceberg,"" Lia Nower, the director of Rutgers' Center for Gambling Studies, told James following Thursday's news.
The other portion of the investigation involved rigged poker games that felt like a page out of ""Ocean's 11.""
Billups allegedly took part in the illegal, high-stakes poker games, helping to lure in rich, unsuspecting victims, according to the feds.
While some of the games were straight, others were rigged thanks to a slew of tech, writes BI's Madeline Berg.
The indictment reads like something out of Inspector Gadget's personal arsenal.
There were bugged shuffling machines. There were poker chip trays that could read cards with hidden cameras. There were poker tables with X-ray technology. There were even cards marked with symbols only visible with special sunglasses or contact lenses.
Ultimately, the scheme resulted in $7 million in winnings, according to the feds.
The league already placed Rozier and Billups on leave. As for the damage to the NBA, it's tough to say. Either way, I wouldn't bet on it.

1. Trump pardons Binance founder Changpeng Zhao. The billionaire pleaded guilty to violating anti-money laundering requirements and was sentenced to four months before his release last year. His pardon ends what the White House called the Biden administration's ""war on crypto.""
2. Beyond Meat is falling back to earth, but the pain has already been felt. After rallying 1,300%, the faux-meat producer's stock has stumbled, dropping as much as 23% on Thursday. However, for short-sellers, the damage is already done.
3. Blackstone's Steve Schwarzman addresses the private-credit critics. The CEO of the world's largest private investment firm isn't letting private credit take the blame for a recent slew of credit crackups. Schwarzman used Blackstone's earnings call to shut down any ties made, blaming ""bank-led and bank-syndicated credits"" instead.
1. Meta told some staff their jobs are being replaced by tech. Staff in Meta's risk division were told the company is eliminating some of their roles, citing a shift from manual reviews to ""more automated processes,"" according to an internal memo viewed by BI. This comes right after 600 people were laid off in the company's superintelligence division. Read the latest memo sent to staff.
2. Elon Musk's xAI wants to go Hollywood. In August, dozens of xAI's tutors began annotating short video clips for an internal project called ""Vision,"" three people with knowledge of the initiative said. Vision's onboarding process included workers labeling clips from Universal Pictures' ""Hellboy II,"" according to internal documents viewed by BI. However, AI projects like these raise complex questions about copyright.
3. Rivian has plans to lay off more than 600 employees. The cuts would affect about 4.5% of Rivian's workforce. Despite EV sales hitting a US record high in the third quarter, the Trump administration's elimination of the federal tax credit presents challenges for EV companies. Read the memo Rivian's CEO sent to staff.
1. Washington's reluctant bargaining chip doesn't want the power. Air traffic controllers ultimately forced the end of the 2019 government shutdown after calling in sick en masse. Now, Washington is watching closely to see if that power will get flexed again. Three controllers told BI they don't want it, though — they just want to do their jobs and get paid.
2. Walmart's new raise strategy for hourly store workers rewards more than just loyalty. The retail giant's new performance-based plan will account for factors like attendance, teamwork, and overall store performance, per a leaked memo seen by BI. The new approach marks a shift from the across-the-board raises that were based on years of service with the company.
3. Millennials are embracing a new kind of beer: cheap. Craft beer sales are declining, and the days of the raspberry-hazy double IPAs are over. Beer is getting back to the basics — from the Sphagett being 2025's drink of the summer to Americans' love for Michelob Ultra.

The Counter-Strike 2 community has been thrown into turmoil after a fateful update from Valve sent shockwaves through Steam’s marketplace, causing the value of skins (purchased with real money) to soar and plummet.
The crashing of the skins market caused Counter-Strike 2's market cap to fall from $5.9 billion to $4.2 billion overnight, as gamers scrambled to adjust to the new value of skins.
Counter-Strike 2, an immensely popular first-person shooter developed by Valve, famously boasts a thriving skins economy.
Players can “invest” their money in expensive skins, which can be bought and resold on Steam’s marketplace, or third party sites (in fact, it's been suggested that the update was designed to bring third-party traders back to Steam, to allow Valve their share of the cut).
Before the controversial update, the value of rare skins tended to steadily increase over time, resulting in many players spending a surprising amount of money to acquire those difficult-to-find skins, some even managing to make a profit by buying and reselling on Steam.
The rarity and value of skins is color-coded, with grey and blue considered relatively common and the most valuable colors being red and gold. Players can trade ten skins of one color to upgrade to the next color, but this rule did not apply to gold.
Gold, which are knives and gloves, are among the most rare and valuable skins in the game, unable to be acquired by trading reds.
Before the update, golds could only be found by opening weapon cases containing random skins, with exceedingly low likelihood of actually uncovering a gold.
Hence, the rarest of the golds often sold on Steam’s marketplace for thousands of dollars.
That is, until Valve’s controversial update, which changed the long-standing rules, allowed players to trade red skins for gold skins, turning the market topsy-turvy.
In an instant, the value of gold skins plummeted, and cheap red skins skyrocketed, with the marketplace forcibly adjusting to the new landscape, sparking panic-buying and selling among players.
Think of the Counter-Strike 2 skins economy as something resembling the NFT craze, with the artificial scarcity of digital items resulting in real monetary value—at least, for a period of time.
Like NFTs, the Counter-Strike skins market was never a stable investment, as the skins held zero value outside of the game, and their rarity was always completely and utterly subject to the whims of Valve.
In response to the shocking update, the Counter-Strike 2 community was thrown into chaos, and reacted by posting memes and lamenting their losses.
Some cracked jokes praising the CEO of Valve, Gabe Newell, for readjusting the economy and making knives affordable to the common player.
While the update has spelled disaster for big investors, the general response from players is mixed, with some viewing the entire skins economy as a waste of time and money, and others are (understandably) upset that their “investments” have been shattered without warning.
This is far from the first time that a video game has developed its own economy, with players investing real money into the system—Roblox, World of Warcraft, Eve Online and certain Minecraft servers contain player-based marketplaces that fluctuate in response to supply and demand.
Players invest a great deal of time and energy into their favorite games, and are willing to pay real money for in-game luxuries and desirable accessories, even purely aesthetic upgrades like skins.
Like an NFT investment or unstable crypto coin, all of that value can melt into pixels overnight."

73,2025-10-24,"Battery life is easily one of the iPhone’s most important features. Whether you own an ultra-thin iPhone Air, battery beast iPhone 17 Pro Max, or some other model, iOS 26 recently introduced a new feature that can make your iPhone’s battery last longer: Adaptive Power.
If your iPhone battery is getting low, iOS has long offered Low Power Mode as a helpful tool.
While I’ve heard of some users keeping Low Power Mode on all the time, that’s a pretty extreme option to stretch your iPhone’s battery life.
iOS 26 has a much more moderate solution.
Adaptive Power is a brand new battery setting that can ensure your iPhone lasts longer—particularly on the high-usage days.
You can find it inside the Settings app’s Battery menu under ‘Power Mode.’
Unlike Low Power Mode, which deactivates lots of features and noticeably degrades your experience, Adaptive Power is all about making small battery gains with minimal impact on performance.
Here’s how Apple describes it:
When your battery usage is higher than usual, iPhone can make small performance adjustments to extend your battery life, including slightly lowering the display brightness or allowing some activities to take a little longer. Low Power Mode may turn on at 20%.
Essentially, on a “normal use” day, your iPhone’s battery and performance won’t necessarily be altered at all.
But when you‘re using your iPhone more than usual, Adaptive Power will kick in and make minor adjustments to help stretch your battery longer.
One caveat: even though Apple doesn’t market Adaptive Power as an AI feature, it technically has the same requirements as Apple Intelligence.
That means you’ll need an iPhone 17 or iPhone Air, iPhone 16, or an iPhone 15 Pro to use it.
Have you been using Adaptive Power in iOS 26? How’s it been working for you? Let us know in the comments.

78,2025-10-24,"I think desks without drawers are dumb, but the rise of sit-stand desks and aesthetic trends mean the market is awash with slabs-on-legs. The lack of storage space eventually becomes a problem, so companies start designing remedial storage objects, extra things for you to buy and tack onto your desk.
This series of remedial objects is by a company called Tidy Desk. Their ""Desk Dock System"" is aimed at the minimalist who cannot tolerate the sight of cables. Thus their Invisible Laptop Dock, which has you leave your laptop out of sight beneath the desk (though still cabled to your screen).
 

 
The Dock is just two plastic brackets.

 
The ""system"" also includes charging docks for AirPods, Apple Watches and external hard drives.

 


 
The promise? A clutter-free desk (at a cost of $35 to $39 per docking object).

 



Surely drawers will make a comeback at some point? 
The before-and-after picture is stupid.  Magically the coffee cup, cereal bowl, tape, can of soda, headphones, car keys, wallet, notebook, banana peel and 7 hard drives all disappear by mounting the laptop and airpods underneath....
I (do and) don't understand why the standard solution is to make a desk that rises instead of just building a taller, stationary desk paired with a barstool-height chair. You'd have so much room for storage under a bar-height desk, and no moving parts!

                The photo of Boston Mobster James Whitey Bulger looms large over Kenneth Osherow, co-owner of the Savin Bar + Kitchen in Boston. Osherow hung a page of ""context"" on the photo, explaining it was not meant to ""celebrate"" the mobster, but to ""acknowledge a chapter in the gritty, complex history of the neighborhood.""

BOSTON — File this one under ""Boston bar fight."" But it's not your typical brawl over a jealous boyfriend or a spilled beer. This dust-up is about décor, and at the center of the trouble are some of Boston's most notorious mobsters: James ""Whitey"" Bulger, now deceased, and his partner in crime, Stephen ""The Rifleman"" Flemmi, now serving life behind bars.
The place is the Savin Bar + Kitchen, in Boston's Dorchester neighborhood, where immediately inside the front door, patrons are greeted by a larger-than-life framed mugshot of Bulger — the mob-boss, murderer, bank robber, drug dealer and extortionist — peering cooly out from under his fedora.
""Funny enough, a lot of people have said, 'Oh, he's very good looking,"" says Savin co-owner Kenneth Osherow.
But that's exactly what's making many locals upset. They see the décor as glamorizing and glorifying Bulger and the other gangsters. The restaurant, they say, should not be serving up such an unsavory slice of the city's past.
""Why would you promote the people who are thugs and murderers and everything else,"" muses Teddy Ryan, an older man sipping wine at the bar.
It's especially appalling at this place, Ryan says, that used to be a bar owned by Eddie Connors, who was one of Bulger's and Flemmi's victims. Connors was shot to death in a phone booth down the road.
""I was very close to Eddie,"" Ryan says. ""And these [photos] are guys who killed him, so yeah, it offends me. Of course it does.""
Connors' family feels the same way.
""Take that f****** thing down,"" says his son, Timmy Connors, who was a baby when his father was murdered by the guy whose image hangs in a gold frame on the wall. ""We all know what [Bulger] did, he killed women, innocent people. He was a rat. Who would want someone like Whitey hanging in their place?""

                While many find the mob-themed decor of the Savin Bar + Kitchen offensive, Sheree Hagler (right) and Bre Berry have no objections. ""This is just a vibe,"" Hagler says. ""I think it looks nice.""

The pictures went up in the bar last spring with little objection, but complaints rapidly escalated in recent weeks. What started with conversation at a community meeting intensified online and in real life. Osherow says he and the staff have endured threatening emails and scary, in-your-face confrontations.
Server Josh Garner says he was accosted last week by an angry man.
""He definitely came in hot, swearing and stuff, and saying his friends were murdered by [those gangsters],"" Garner recalls. He says the man finally left after warning him '[the pictures] better be down by Tuesday. We're coming back.' ""
But so far, Savin's owners have refused to take down the mobster photos, insisting they're not glorifying gangsters, they're only reflecting Boston's gritty, gory and well-known past.
""People are definitely overreacting,"" Osherow says.
He says he and the staff feel misunderstood and unfairly targeted, in no small part, they say, because they actually had nothing to do with choosing or installing the mob-themed décor.

                Co-owner Kenneth Osherow says the mobster photos hanging around the Savin Bar + Kitchen in Boston were never meant to glorify the gangsters. He says they were selected and installed by the restaurant makeover show Secret Service, starring Gordon Ramsey, and might soon be replaced due to complaints from neighbors.

Instead, it was all the doing of the restaurant makeover show Secret Service starring celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay, who surprised Savin with the makeover last April.
""Savin Bar + Kitchen desperately needed a new and coherent identity, so our renovation team have gone in to give them one,"" Ramsey intones in the episode that aired in August. After the transformation's big reveal, Ramsey admires the bar's new decor.
""It's got that old 1970 mobster feel,"" he says. ""Finally, [Savin] has an identity. There's nothing like this in this neighborhood, so this should stand out for all the right reasons.""
Or course, it didn't quite turn out that way.
Some have likened the controversy surrounding Savin's display of old-time mobsters to the debate swirling around old statues of Confederate generals. But Osherow insists it's not at all analogous.
""If you put up a statue in a park, let's say, you do that because it's a famous person that you want to glorify. It's a given. You're trying to say that's a good person,"" he says. ""Our pictures were not put up to say that these people were good people or that they were heroes. It's very obvious that they were bad people and criminals. They're mug shots!""
To underscore the point, Osherow wrote up a page-long explanation and taped it right onto Bulger's picture shortly after it was hung last spring. ""This isn't an homage,"" the note reads. ""We display this photo not to celebrate [these mobsters] but to acknowledge a chapter in the complex, gritty history of our neighborhood [and the bar that] was a front-row seat to a notorious era in Boston's underworld […] By recognizing this past we remember where we've been and how far we've come."" The note also includes links to more history.
Savin's general manager, Angelique Johnson, agrees that it would be wrong to simply erase or ignore history, whether it's about the Boston mob or, she says, the many streets and schools in Boston named for slaveowners.
""We can't change that because that's history,"" she says. ""It's all very painful, but that is how we learn. That's how we make sure it doesn't get repeated. I don't want to erase history at all. Kids in this generation need to know what happened.""
In any case, Savin is certainly not alone in leaning into the city's sordid past.
Along with the countless books and movies, there is plenty of mobster merch on the market – from T-shirts to trading cards, as well as popular mobster tours. One in Boston is called ""Lobsters and Mobsters,"" another has been dubbed ""Mobsters Mayhem and Murder,"" and yet another promises tourists will visit ""the exact spot where men and women were shot down, butchered, and buried in cold blood.""
It's a continuous source of fascination in Boston and beyond. And even at Savin bar, there are plenty of fans of the mobster photos.
""What's wrong with them? I think it looks nice,"" says Sheree Hagler, sharing oysters at the bar with a friend.
""It to me is décor. This is just a vibe, and it is what it is,"" she says. ""I don't think it's even that serious. I mean everyone in this world today is just too sensitive.""
But Savin's owners are growing weary of the fight and are now considering a change.
One idea is to simply replace the mobster photos with pictures of some locals-done-good. The running list includes everyone from actor Mark Wahlberg to the founder of the nation's first animal rescue league.
Gordon Ramsay's show did not respond to requests for comment, but Savin's owners say Ramsay's team is also now eager to put an end to the controversy — they're offering to come swap out the photos, no charge.

81,2025-10-24,"Paul Barning disappeared while competing in a game fishing tournament off the coast of Australia in February
 Eight months after a 58-year-old father was pulled into the Pacific Ocean by a shark during a fishing competition off the coast of Australia, the local coroner is sharing details about his final moments.

 On Sunday, Feb. 23, Paul Barning was competing in the New South Wales Game Fishing Association (NSWGFA) Interclub State Championships tournament at Port Stephens, the Coroner’s Court of New South Wales, Lidcombe, said in a recent report.

 Early that morning, he set off on his boat with longtime friend Bradley Elphinstone, his friend's son, Reece Elphinstone, and another man named Ryan Hope.

Paul Barning Facebook
 By around 12:40 p.m. local time, Hope caught a large Mako shark weighing more than 400 lbs.

 As Hope began to reel in the large catch, Barning stood at his left, with Reece standing slightly behind him to assist. Bradley, who was at the helm, started the engine to follow the shark as the process continued.

 When the shark was just below the water’s surface, Hope stepped back, while Reece moved closer to assist Barning, who took hold of the trace line. Barning wrapped the line around each hand at least once before commencing a “tug-of-war game” to bring the shark on the boat.

 “However, the shark moved quickly into deeper water pulling the line away from Paul and Ryan,” wrote Deputy State Coroner Derek Lee, noting that Barning’s hands were still entwined in the trace line.

 ""As Paul’s hands were entwined in the trace line, he was heard to yell words to the effect of, “Oh no”, as he was pulled to the edge of the boat,"" the coroner wrote.

 When his legs hit the side of the boat, he flipped 180 degrees over the edge of the boat and was pulled into the water.  Bradley immediately put the boat in neutral and the men began looking for their fellow crew member, officials said.

 “Ryan began reeling the shark back in believing that Paul may still be attached to the trace line,” the coroner said. “After approximately 10 minutes, the shark was pulled close to the surface but there was no sign of Paul.”

 The men then cut the line and let the shark go because there was no sign of their friend.

 As they continued to look for Barning, who was not wearing a life jacket, Bradley activated the “man overboard” function on a GPS tracking device. A multi-agency search for Barning was promptly launched, but efforts ended on Feb. 25.

 At last week’s hearing, the coroner said it's believed Barning died on Feb. 23, although his exact cause of death cannot be determined because his body was never located.

 “Mr Barning died as a result of misadventure when he was suddenly and unexpectedly pulled into the water whilst managing a trace line when taking part in a game fishing competition,” Lee wrote. 

 Born in Sydney, Barning owned a construction company and was also an avid fisherman, having won many trophies at previous game fishing competitions, the coroner said.

 “By all accounts, Mr Barning was a beloved husband and father, a genuine and respected friend and a skilled fisherman,” officials wrote. “There is no doubt that he is greatly missed, and that the sudden and unexpected circumstances in which he went missing have only added to the grief and trauma that his family, loved ones and friends have experienced.”

 Following the incident, the New South Wales Game Fish Association shared a press release about Barning, and shut down reports that he had been attacked by a shark after falling into the ocean.

 “Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Leonie, his son Sam and daughters Eleanor and Brigette in this trying time,” the organization said.

The velocity of the S&P 500 Index’s 35% rally from the April lows has taken many investors by surprise, including us. Nearly all traditional valuation metrics suggest the market is expensive: the forward (next-12-month) P/E recently stood at 22.8x, a level previously only witnessed during the tech bubble of the late 1990s. While some signs of froth are certainly evident, other factors suggest the market’s recent advance is grounded in a favorable policy mix that supports improving fundamentals, or perhaps even a boom, into 2026. As a result, whether a bubble is forming has become a key debate for equity investors.
One example of a decoupling between stock prices and underlying fundamentals that bears watching is recent labor market weakness, the argument being that slowing job creation is a sign that the economy is on shaky footing. By extension, equities should be lower as reduced labor income weighs on overall consumer spending.
However, job creation remains in positive territory and is expected to rebound into 2026 as fiscal stimulus from the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) comes online and trade/immigration policy headwinds abate. Importantly, the index of Aggregate Weekly Payrolls — a good proxy for overall U.S. labor income — continues to show solid gains and has expanded at a 4.2% annualized pace through the first eight months of the year, which should power future consumption. Furthermore, with uncertainty waning and hiring expected to rebound, it would not be a surprise to see this metric accelerate toward 2024’s 4.6% pace in the coming months.
Another area where fundamentals are not suggestive of bubble territory is corporate profits. Earnings picked up in the second quarter, and forward guidance from companies suggests that they are finding ways to offset the costs from higher tariffs with margins and profits expected to continue to rise in the third quarter and into 2026. Accelerating earnings are a harbinger of a healthy labor market, whereas they tend to plateau and then decline beginning two quarters on average ahead of historical recessions dating back to 1965. With the consensus expecting continued profit growth in the year to come, the recent trajectory also bears little resemblance to these past periods. 
Many of the disconnects between rising equities and underlying fundamentals that the bubble camp highlights are more nuanced than they initially appear. This begs the question if, instead of a bubble, is a boom on the horizon? The fiscal and monetary policy backdrops are more suggestive of a boom, with the potent policy mix of a Fed cutting cycle and a fiscal stimulus package. This combination is typically only seen in the wake of economic downturns in an effort to lift the economy out of the doldrums. 
Although the Fed may ultimately under-deliver on the expectations of an additional four-plus cuts priced into futures markets by the end of 2026, we believe that multiple cuts will occur. If the Fed ultimately ends up cutting less than the market expects, we believe this would be treated as a positive by investors given it would likely come amid a healthier economic backdrop. With the passage of the OBBB, the boost from fiscal policy is more certain than the Fed’s path in 2026. Fiscal stimulus in the form of consumer and corporate tax cuts will arrive in 2026, with the Congressional Budget Office estimating the impact at nearly 1% of GDP. 
The improved outlook for 2026 is not just a function of government policy, however. Economists expect consumer spending to remain robust while business investment accelerates on the back of continued strength in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. Already, some investors point to hundreds of billions of dollars in infrastructure capex (chips, power, data centers) and sky-high pay packages for leading AI researchers as signs of irrational exuberance reminiscent of the late 1990s tech bubble. 
However, it is important to note that while equities did form a bubble during this period, the underlying economy also saw benefits. With the benefit of hindsight, this is clear in productivity data from the Internet revolution. The key question at present is whether strong productivity gains can be sustained and move higher in a similar fashion. 
A common adage is that “the stock market is not the economy.” The two are closely related but can disconnect at times and in certain areas. As of late this rings most true with regard to AI, with signs of froth evident in some areas of the equity market. One example is the 52% advance in the Goldman Sachs “Non-Profitable Tech” index year to date through September, where investors are placing significant emphasis on potential earnings of these companies. 
However, many of the current tech leaders that have powered the index higher in recent years are delivering strong profits and free cash flow. While investors are assigning lofty multiples to the potential leaders of tomorrow, the sector still trades materially below the multiples seen during the peak of the tech bubble while delivering superior (50% better) returns on equity.
There is no guarantee that the current tech-driven bull market will reach the size of previous bubbles before encountering problems or collapsing. However, this reminds us of another time-tested market adage, “Bull markets don’t die of old age, they’re killed by the Federal Reserve.” With that in mind, if a bubble is indeed forming, we could be witnessing its early days because the Fed is working to support the economy and financial markets, not slow their ascent.
The Fed began to cut rates last month. Historically, equities have fared well in the year after the Fed began a soft landing rate cut cycle, rising 18.3% on average over the next year and 48.6% over the next two. If sell-side consensus expectations of 12.9% EPS growth over the next 12 months are realized, it would be consistent with a soft landing as one-year forward earnings historically decline double digits on average in recessionary outcomes. 
Although strong gains on the back of rate cuts would seem to play into the bubble narrative, one key bubble ingredient that we believe remains missing is speculative excess. Although signs of froth exist, classic bubbles typically see rapid price acceleration driven by investor euphoria, indiscriminate buying and a detachment from financial realities. 
At present, investor sentiment remains cautious with the number of bullish and bearish respondents to the AAII Sentiment Survey being nearly balanced (+3.7 bullish, a mid-pack reading). Widespread indiscriminate buying does not appear to be playing out and the rally in equities has coincided with an improving fundamental outlook, which suggests a lack of detachment from financial reality. To that end, economist expectations for 2026 GDP have risen by 40 bps from the mid-May lows, while sell-side EPS expectations for the S&P 500 took an unusual turn higher during the third quarter following passage of the OBBB and as trade policy visibility improved. 
Historically, bubbles have formed when overly ample liquidity has encouraged excessive risk-taking behavior. While liquidity is certainly ample at present, excessive risk-taking behavior does not appear to be playing out. This is not to say that signs of excess do not exist nor that pockets of weakness aren’t apparent. However, these remain somewhat isolated or are explainable, such as reduced immigration being a primary contributor to slower job creation.
Over the long run, changes in earnings expectations explain the vast majority — about two-thirds over one-year periods and three-quarters over two-year periods — of stock price movement. Only time will tell if equities are currently discounting an overly optimistic “bubbly” future or an underappreciated “boom” in earnings, but the broadly improving outlook leads us to believe that the boom scenario is more likely.

These benefits were seen across all chondrosarcoma subgroups, including isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wild-type and mutant patients. This finding could be notable, as some research suggests that IDH-mutant disease is associated with poorer outcomes. However, this is a point of contention among the scientific community.
Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis.
Despite promising efficacy, ozekibart, which was previously known as INBRX-109, led to a patient death, which was caused by liver toxicity. However, Inhibrx Biosciences noted that this occurred “before the implementation of mitigation measures”, and that hepatoxicity was only observed in those with underlying liver function issues.
When hepatotoxicity was accounted for, the drug resulted in a low incidence of mild-to-moderate treatment-related hepatic adverse events, which occurred at a rate of 11.8% compared with the 4.5% seen in the placebo arm.
Following the promising results of the registrational ChonDRAgon study, Inhibrx Biosciences plans to submit a biologics licence application (BLA) to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for ozekibart in chondrosarcoma by Q2 2026. If approved, the drug could become the first targeted therapy to make it to market in this indication.
This trial outcome makes ozekibart the first therapy to demonstrate a statistically significant PFS benefit in a chondrosarcoma clinical trial.
This will be welcome news for patients with the disease, as there are currently no targeted therapies approved for use in the indication, which has been notoriously difficult to treat due to its lack of response to conventional chemotherapies.
Inhibrx Biosciences retained the rights for ozekibart in 2024 following Sanofi’s $1.7bn acquisition of its parent corporation, Inhibrx.
If ozekibart makes it to market, it could face competition from Servier Pharmaceuticals’ IDH inhibitor, Tibsovo (ivosidenib), which is currently in Phase III for conventional chondrosarcoma.
Bristol Myers Squibb’s blockbuster programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blocker, Opdivo (nivolumab), could also make a debut on the chondrosarcoma market down the line, following the positive results of the Phase II IMMUNOSARC I (NCT03277924) master trial. This study found that Opdivo plus Sutent (sunitinib) has activity in advanced extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma.
While chondrosarcoma was Inhibrx Biosciences’ original focus for ozekibart, the biotech is now exploring the drug in other indications, including heavily pretreated colorectal cancer. In an early-stage trial, the drug triggered an overall response rate (ORR) of 23% while demonstrating disease control in 92% of patients when used alongside combination chemotherapy, FOLFRI.
Meanwhile, the drug also showed promise in relapsed/refractory Ewing sarcoma, demonstrating an ORR of 64% and a DCR of 92%.
In a 24 October statement, Inhibrx Biosciences CEO and co-founder Mark Lappe noted that the results could signal ozekibart’s potential “not only in sarcomas, but also in high unmet need solid tumour indications”.

            Even after the doubling of hotel supply by 2030, Northeast India will still remain underserved, as this will be less than 3% of India’s total branded hotel supply.          
Select a question above or ask something else
The number of branded hotel rooms in Northeast India is expected to double by 2030, according to new data from hospitality consultancy HVS Anarock.
As of June 2025, the eight Northeastern states of Assam, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Tripura, Meghalaya, Manipur and Nagaland collectively host around 3,450 branded hotel rooms, just 1.7% of India’s total supply. Sikkim and Assam dominate the region’s inventory, accounting for nearly 68% of existing rooms, with Gangtok and Guwahati alone representing more than half.
That balance is shifting fast. More than 3,000 additional branded rooms are in the pipeline across Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Tripura, and Nagaland.
HVS Anarock said Assam will drive the next phase of growth, with nearly 2,000 new branded keys expected between 2025 and 2030, fueled by Guwahati’s rise and the state’s emerging tourism corridors. The expansion signals a long-awaited hospitality boom in one of India’s most c

Northeast India's hotel market is experiencing rapid growth, with branded hotel rooms projected to double by 2030 due to increased investment from major hotel chains and improved infrastructure. Enhanced connectivity, particularly in air and rail transport, is driving higher tourist arrivals and making the region more accessible. Despite these advancements, the region will continue to represent a small fraction of India's total hotel supply, underscoring its vast untapped tourism potential.

94,2025-10-24,"Run a bunch of Claude Codes in parallel
Hi there! It’s Charlie and Jackson, founders of Conductor.
The two of us met eight years ago when we played ultimate frisbee together at Brown. Last year, we quit our jobs at Point72 and Netflix to start a company together.
Conductor is used by engineers at YC, Linear, Vercel, Notion, Supabase, and other leading companies, and it’s changing how people work. One user told me:
A huge amount of my work now is wildly parallelized, in a way I’ve never had to worry about before. It’s been a while since a dev tool has changed my life [like Conductor did].
There’s a big opportunity ahead of us. In the next few years, humans will shift focus from direct work (writing code) to orchestrating teams of AIs—and we're going to need entirely new interfaces to do it.
We want you to help us build them.
We’re looking for a scrappy jack of all trades: an idea generator, an explorer, someone who can talk with users, design, prototype, and then actually build a beautiful product.
You’re probably a good fit if:
We write most of our code in Typescript, but Typescript experience is not necessary. We’re looking for the kind of person who can figure it out on the job.
Pay
Compared to similar companies at our stage, we aim to pay roughly median salary and 90th percentile equity.
We give out more stock than other companies because we hire less, and each employee can make an unusually large impact.
Health care
… and, most importantly, Real Health Care: sleep, nutrition, exercise, social support. We try to make Conductor a strongly positive influence on all those fronts. More about our culture.
Stuff
Your ideas here
Conductor is growing fast, and we want YOU to join us!
Conductor lets you run a bunch of coding agents in parallel. We’re used by engineers at YC, Linear, Vercel, Notion, Supabase, and many more. We're backed by some of the best investors in the valley.
There’s a ton to build. In the next few years, humans will shift focus from direct work (writing code) to orchestrating teams of AIs—and we're going to need entirely new interfaces to do it.
We're looking for generalist engineers and product designers to work with in person with us in our beautiful San Francisco office.

Anthropomorphism is the ability to see a face in anything. Whether it’s seeing Jesus on a grilled cheese sandwich, or just seeing faces in cars by looking at their headlights as eyes. It’s fairly common for humans to look for faces – we developed this pattern-matching ability to recognize predators in the wild… now we’re using it to create the funniest PS5 controller stands ever.
The ‘Face’ as PRINTMOTION calls it, is a fairly simple stand that turns your PS5 into an odd face, with the joypads becoming eyes and the hand grips on the side being the world’s silliest pairs of pigtails. I honestly don’t know what makes this particular design so funny, but it’s probably the juxtaposition of something as advanced as a PlayStation controller against something as silly as a fairly blank face staring at you with absolutely zero thought behind those eyes.
Designer: PRINTMOTION






The stand is currently available as a 3D printable file on CULTS3D for a low price of $4.39. That way, you buy the stand and print as many of it as you want. Pretty cheap if you ask me. You can choose your own color, material, or even optimize the stand to have a pass-through cable for charging, a nosering, or a moustache. Something to make the ‘face’ look like it has a little gravitas. For now, it just looks like a dude wearing the silliest pair of glasses along with pigtails on either side. I just can’t take it seriously.

Is it me, though? Or do you find the stand odd too? The photo above literally makes it look like a Victorian-era maid, with her bonnet on her head. Those tiny beady eyes feel insect-like. It’s weirdly Lovecraftian. Maybe there’s a market for this, I don’t know. I would personally modify this thing to look a little more self aware. Maybe a cyberpunk face mask, maybe the tongue sticking out. Anything but this!

97,2025-10-24,"The morning arrives with optimism and unfiltered joy—you’re at your sociable best. But Ganesha warns that clouds may gather later. Unexpected news may dampen your spirits or distract you from your usual rhythm. When the mood shifts, it’s important to pause, not panic. Step back, catch your breath, and know this dip is temporary. Reassurance may come from an unexpected quarter. By evening, your inner tide will likely turn back toward balance.
It’s a slow-paced, uneventful day, but that’s not necessarily bad. You’ll find comfort in shared silence and lounging with your partner. Casual discussions might drift into deeper waters, yet nothing feels urgent. Take this quiet time as a chance to rest, recharge, and enjoy simple companionship without expectation.
Today promises strong returns, especially from past investments. Ganesha sees favourable conditions if you’ve been exploring the stock market. It’s a good day to trust your earlier judgment. Sit back and let your previous efforts deliver. You’re reminded that timing and preparation often align to create fruitful outcomes.
It will be a smooth day. You are fast, furiously efficient and almost flawless in your work. Your boss is likely to accept this fact. You may have to spend a lot of time browsing web pages in search of a crucial piece of information.
BJP MP and former UP DGP Brij Lal has sparked controversy with a video accusing five sanitation workers in Lucknow's Gomti Nagar Extension of being Bangladeshi infiltrators. Lal, a former IPS officer, claims to know how terrorism works and alleges that these workers are a threat to the nation. He appeals to CM Yogi Adityanath to deport them and claims they have fake identities."
98,2025-10-24,"Apple has regained momentum in the global computer market, achieving above-average performance in the third quarter of 2025. According to data released by Counterpoint Research, Mac shipments increased by 14.9% compared to the same period last year, outpacing the overall PC market growth of 8.1%. This surge places Apple close behind Lenovo, the current market leader, and slightly ahead of ASUS, consolidating its position as one of the top players in the industry.
The growth in Mac sales is largely attributed to the success of recent MacBook models (like the recently released MacBook Pro 14″ M5) and the rising corporate adoption of Apple computers. Additionally, the end of Windows 10 support and strategic inventory adjustments driven by new U.S. import policies have played a key role in boosting Apple’s performance.
In the brand ranking, Lenovo maintained its leadership with a 17% increase in shipments, followed by Apple’s strong 14.9% rise and ASUS’s 14% growth. Dell, however, experienced a 1% decline, and the collective category of “Others” dropped by 3%. These results highlight a broader recovery in the PC market, which had slowed down after the pandemic-driven demand surge.
The report emphasizes that consumers and businesses are increasingly seeking energy-efficient laptops with seamless hardware-software integration, areas where Apple has shown a competitive edge. The company’s M-series processors continue to attract professionals and enterprises looking for performance and power efficiency, reinforcing the appeal of Macs in both personal and business segments.
Looking ahead, Counterpoint Research predicts that the next significant phase of growth will stem from the rise of AI-powered PCs. These systems, expected to become mainstream starting in 2026, will feature new AI-focused chipsets capable of handling advanced machine learning tasks directly on the device. Major manufacturers — including Apple, Lenovo, and ASUS — are already positioning themselves to lead this upcoming shift.
As the industry transitions toward intelligent computing, competition is expected to intensify, with brands racing to integrate AI capabilities that enhance user experience and productivity.
