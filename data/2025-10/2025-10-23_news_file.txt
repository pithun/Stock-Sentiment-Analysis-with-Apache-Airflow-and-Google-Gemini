General Motors CEO Mary Barra says China's automakers aren't just waging a brutal price war over EVs, they have an overproduction problem, too.
Barra was speaking to The Verge's Nilay Patel on the outlet's ""Decoder"" podcast when she was asked how GM intended to compete against Chinese automakers.
""Right now, there is an incredible price war going on. You can't have over 100 different OEMs in a country trying to compete, especially now that they're competing on price,"" Barra told Patel in an episode that aired Wednesday.
""I would also say the market is over capacity in China, which is causing, from a business perspective, exporting to other markets, but they're also doing it while highly subsidized in many cases,"" she said.
Barra said that when it comes to competing in China, GM will strike a balance between meeting China's regulatory and safety requirements and ""regularly benchmarking our Chinese competitors.""
Representatives for Barra at GM did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.
Barra made a similar observation when she spoke at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in October 2024. She said the EV market in China was oversaturated, and vehicle prices were getting ""lower and lower"" because of it.
""You have to look at what the sustainable business is because the situation that is there right now is not sustainable,"" Barra said.
Chinese automakers themselves have also acknowledged the damaging effects a price war could have on their businesses.
On October 1, BYD said in an exchange filing that it sold 396,270 cars in September, a 5.5% decline from the 419,426 cars it sold a year ago.
BYD said in its August earnings report that its ""short-term profitability"" had been weighed down by ""industry malpractices"" such as ""excessive marketing"" and discounting.
Xpeng founder and CEO He Xiaopeng said in a November interview with The Straits Times that most Chinese automakers won't survive beyond the next decade.
""I personally think that there will only be seven major car companies that will exist in the coming 10 years,"" He said, without specifying the names of the seven companies.
In an exchange filing last week, GM said it was taking a $1.6 billion charge ""based on a planned strategic realignment of our EV capacity and manufacturing footprint to consumer demand.""
Under the Biden administration, EV buyers could enjoy a $7,500 consumer tax credit if they bought a new EV, and a $4,000 consumer tax credit for a used EV. The Trump administration eliminated those federal EV incentives last month.
Without those incentives, GM said it expected the ""adoption rate of EVs to slow.""
""We do expect, and I think the industry expects, and the external forecasters believe, that we're going to see slower EV growth, but I think the important thing is we think we'll still see growth,"" Barra told The Verge's ""Decoder"" podcast.
GM's shares are up by over 27% year to date.

    They're two of the best camera phones on the market, but how do they compete face to face? Let's compare some photos and find out.
  
Google's and Apple's flagship phones compared.
When you spend more than $1,000 on a smartphone, you expect great cameras as part of the package. It's not enough to offer a decent point-and-shoot experience at this level.
To truly stand out, today's smartphones have to pack pro-level camera performance into impossibly small bodies, leveraging dedicated image-processing hardware and software to make even rookie photographers look competent. 
No two rivals represent this arms race better than Apple's iPhone 17 Pro and Google's Pixel 10 Pro XL. These flagship models represent not just the high end of each line but also the role models for other companies to follow, particularly the Pixel 10 Pro XL, since Google makes Android. (For a look at how the iPhone compares against another leading camera phone, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, see CNET Editor at Large Andrew Lanxon's photo shootout.)
I've been carrying both phones around Seattle and took them on a trip to the Columbia River Gorge, separating Washington and Oregon, to see how their cameras compare. Image quality has been excellent on both, but they each surprised me at times. For example, when I thought one would overcompensate in color, it would be the other that went overboard. But which one? You might also be surprised.

All photos were captured with the default automatic settings, though some of them were captured in raw format for more editing options later; however, none of these images have been corrected. All were exported as JPEGs so CNET's publishing system can read them (versus Apple's HEIF format, for instance). 
Both cameras also capture in high dynamic range mode, which increases brightness in certain areas, but only on displays that support HDR viewing. What you see on this page may not match exactly what you'd see on the iPhone or Pixel screen. That's a general issue with HDR images on the web right now, until the technology is more widely adopted. 
Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.
The main camera in each phone has to pull a lot of weight. It's the one that gets the best light-gathering ability (an aperture of f/1.78 for the iPhone and f/1.68 for the Pixel) and a wide, but not ultrawide, field of view to capture most scenes.

I'll take almost any excuse to get out in the fall leaves this time of year. This scene has it all: fallen leaves, long shadows, clear crisp weather and even a man in a red shirt to draw attention. Both photos are great representations of the moment, though the iPhone's colors are a little more punchy without being oversaturated. Oddly, the foreground branch in the Pixel's image is slightly out of focus, though it's only noticeable if you zoom in. We'll come back to this scene with the telephoto cameras later.

When testing cameras, I tend to look for spots where people are likely to take photos. I also like to find ones that might challenge a smartphone camera: dark shadows in the foreground, a bright light source in the middle and lots of little details like leaves and sailboat masts that can be tricky for any camera. 
Both cameras have done well here, too. The colors in the iPhone shot seem more natural to my eye, while the Pixel is ever so slightly muted. But really, they're both lovely.

Did I mention challenging? Let's fire into the sun on a foggy morning. Again, I'm happy with both photos. There's plenty of softness around the sun as the light blends outward, and the white balance is under control in each one. If you pixel-peep, you'll notice the Pixel 10 Pro XL is a touch sharper -- look at the street lamp attached to the telephone pole at the right edge -- but also more noisy in the dark areas, like the fence at left.

Not every pair of shots was similar, and this scene was a surprise. Initially, the color was way off with the iPhone: very blue and unexpectedly saturated. After some investigating, I realized the iPhone was set to capture with the Bright photographic style by default, a new feature in iOS 26. I've had that selected since I got the iPhone 17 Pro, and in most cases, it does create a punchy, engaging photo. But here it went overboard. 
Switching to the Standard style brought the tones and colors back in line, even though they're still too cool blue for my taste. The Pixel 10 Pro XL has done a great job rendering a more faithful version of the scene with the warm fall hues.

Looking at the sculpture from a few feet back, the iPhone is still obsessed with making everything blue. Even after setting the photographic style to Standard, the sky still looks unnaturally saturated. The Pixel 10 Pro XL, again, nails the color.
Shot with the iPhone 17 Pro, main camera, in Portrait mode.
In this photo, I'm not just looking to see how the cameras rendered the subject in shade with bright sunlight in the background, but also how each phone handles its Portrait mode. That's the soft background effect (bokeh) created in software because at the main cameras' focal lengths, the look is difficult to achieve naturally.
Shot with the Pixel 10 Pro XL, main camera, in Portrait mode.
I'm happy to report that both cameras have improved the modes over time -- the Pixel 10 Pro XL can apply Portrait mode when shooting in the 50-megapixel high-res mode -- with natural-looking bokeh and minimal artifacts around the subject. In this case, I prefer the Pixel 10 Pro XL image because of the look on her face, but the lighting and color of the iPhone 17 Pro photo is better overall (I should have kept snapping photos with the iPhone until I got a better expression). 
Shot with the iPhone 17 Pro, main camera (left); Pixel 10 Pro XL, main camera (right).
This set of photos reveals another surprise that turned out to be consistent throughout my experience. They're both similar, but the Pixel tends to be more restrained in tone, color and saturation. Not necessarily flat, but it's almost as if Google is trying to atone for the over-processed sins of past smartphone cameras. 
The iPhone photo is a little warmer, brighter and more contrasty; look at the cement walkway at the bottom-left corner. I'm not saying either photo is bad; it was a bright, cloudless day. But like Andrew Lanxon did in his iPhone 17 Pro/Samsung S25 Ultra shootout, I prefer more natural, less contrasty images in general. In that comparison, the iPhone was the model of restraint, but here, it's the one providing more pop overall.

This guy gets included because that vest and those glasses just make him look cool.
The ultrawide cameras in each phone remain largely unchanged from their previous models.

Shot with the Pixel 10 Pro XL, ultrawide camera.
What's notable about the ultrawide cameras is something you don't see: distortion. Apple and Google have done well to automatically correct for warped edges. The top railing in both photos doesn't bend back toward the viewer as one would expect with an extremely wide lens. In terms of color and tone, the iPhone looks better to me with its more vibrant greens and brighter exposure.

In this tight bend in the road, the iPhone is brighter and warmer than the Pixel 10 Pro XL. 
One reason to buy a Pro phone is to shoot with a telephoto camera that reaches farther than you can move your feet. The telephoto on the iPhone 17 Pro now finally has a 48-megapixel sensor and offers a 4x optical zoom, while the Pixel 10 Pro XL's 48-megapixel camera has a 5x optical zoom. 
But we also have to consider the 2x (both), 8x (iPhone) and 10x (Pixel) ranges, which each company calls ""optical image quality,"" because those use a crop of the main camera and the telephoto camera, respectively. 
Shot with the iPhone 17 Pro, telephoto camera, at 4x zoom.
Shot with the Pixel 10 Pro XL, telephoto camera, at 5x zoom.
I promised we'd get back to this scene for a good reason. From the same spot as the main camera image earlier, these use the 4x and 5x zoom levels of each camera. For a fall-color photo, I'm partial to the brighter, more saturated iPhone photo. The Pixel shot is also good, but slightly muted in comparison to tamp down the highlights on the leaves. In each photo, the headline of the sign affixed to the bench is clearly readable -- a sign so far away that I didn't even notice it from the vantage point where the photos were taken.

Shot with the Pixel 10 Pro XL, telephoto camera, at 10x zoom.
Here I go again, taking photos directly into the sun. But this time it's with the iPhone's 8x zoom and the Pixel's 10x zoom. They've both handled the brightness and color of the last moments before sunset well, but the iPhone has captured the sun's glow better and has better managed the light fringing on the clouds. Notably, though, the notorious lens flare from the iPhone is a big distraction, whereas the Pixel has avoided it. 
Shot with the iPhone 17 Pro, main camera, at 2x zoom.
Shot with the Pixel 10 Pro XL, main camera, at 2x zoom.
One surprise about photographing with these two phones is that I'm reaching for the 2x zoom level more often, which is a crop of the main camera's sensor, and not the telephoto camera. In this pair, the iPhone's white balance lighting up the fog in gold hues grabs my eye right away. The Pixel looks like it wants to give a ""correct"" temperature, not one that reflects the conditions. That said, the light streaks are more dramatic in the Pixel's photo, and it's sharper overall. Still, I prefer the iPhone's version. 
Also worth mentioning: Google's processing has delivered a 50-megapixel image, so even though it's recording just the middle portion of the sensor, the final shot is upscaled well. The iPhone at 2x records a 12-megapixel photo, regardless of which resolution mode you've selected.

Another photo shot using the 2x zoom levels in each camera. The Pixel 10 Pro XL's main camera has a slightly narrower field of view compared to the iPhone, so when cropped in the framing is a little tighter. And here we see the iPhone photo being brighter and more saturated, though not by a lot. Still, the Pixel image comes across as muted -- I'd want to punch up the color and brightness in editing later if this were the only camera I had with me. 
Shot with the iPhone 17 Pro, telephoto camera, at 4x zoom.
Shot with the Pixel 10 Pro XL, telephoto camera, at 5x zoom.
Here are two examples of why a long telephoto option is great to have in a phone. I'm all for ""zooming with your feet,"" but a mountain that's miles away isn't going to be much bigger in the frame without a whole lot of walking. With a telephoto, however, it's like the mountain comes to me.
The iPhone 17 Pro photo of Mount Adams at 4x zoom captures lots of detail in the grass, the trees and the mountain itself, all at 48-megapixel resolution. However, it does feel underexposed to me on the gray, cloudy day. 
The Pixel 10 Pro XL image at 5x is also full of detail and resolution, but has better color and exposure. Straight out of the camera, the Pixel takes this one. 
Shot with the iPhone 17 Pro, telephoto camera, 8x zoom (left); Pixel 10 Pro XL, telephoto camera, 10x zoom (right).
With an 8x and 10x zoom, the compression of the mountain, cloud and trees creates an even more dramatic photo. Again, the Pixel's exposure and color have created a better image. The Pixel image has been scaled up to 50 megapixels from the telephoto sensor's crop, so credit to the processing here. The iPhone's 8x zoom creates 12-megapixel images; it's more true to what the sensor is recording, but you don't get as many pixels overall. That said, resolution isn't everything, and the 8x photos have been consistently good.
Shot with the iPhone 17 Pro, main camera, 2x zoom (left); Pixel 10 Pro XL, main camera, 2x zoom (right).
After the two Mount Adams photos in which the Pixel 10 Pro XL ran counter to its trend, in this 2x zoom example, it's back to being more muted and less vibrant. The iPhone 17 Pro renders the yellow leaves, green moss and a more pleasing overall exposure. It's not that the Pixel rendered a bad image, but for this scene, the iPhone better matches what I saw.
We're used to phone cameras like the Pixel and iPhone handling low-light and night photos almost effortlessly, but it's still one of the more difficult tasks a smartphone camera takes on.

Technically, these photos don't count as Night mode images because, although it was dusk and rapidly getting dark, both cameras had enough light to shoot the scene with their main cameras at full 48- and 50-megapixel resolutions. Here I would favor the iPhone's slightly warmer tones, but they're both acceptable images. 
Shot with the iPhone 17 Pro, telephoto camera, 4x zoom (left); Pixel 10 Pro XL, telephoto camera, 5x zoom (right).
Let's pile on the darkness: Nighttime outside, taking a picture through the window of a dark bar with a full spectrum of lighting. The colors are great in both, and the Pixel 10 Pro XL image is high-resolution enough to read the poster inside and even some recognizable bottle labels. The iPhone 17 Pro's image is 12 megapixels, but it also looks good. There are a few areas of motion blur in both pointing to longer shutter speeds, but that's not a surprise in a dimly lit environment like this.

Is it too early for holiday lights? Not here. Although the photos are similar, zooming in reveals more resolution and detail in the Pixel 10 Pro XL photo. It's a little soft in details like the brick pattern on the bell tower. Both photos were captured using the main cameras, not the ultrawide, as you might think from the angle of the tower. 
Who would have guessed that a selfie camera would get some of the biggest improvements this year? The iPhone 17 Pro now includes an 18-megapixel camera with a square sensor that can capture vertical or horizontal selfies without turning the physical phone. The Pixel 10 Pro XL's front camera is the same 42-megapixel sensor from the previous year's model, but it outputs only 10-megapixel images. 
Shot with the iPhone 17 Pro, front camera.

Not to be repetitive, but the results from the selfie cameras mostly match what we've seen with the rear cameras: The iPhone's image is brighter and more saturated, though in direct sunlight, the light on my face comes close to getting blown out to white. The Pixel's image is again muted, presumably correcting for the bright sunlight.

After I stepped back into the shadow of the tree, the photos were more similar in tone and color. The iPhone may have a slight edge here in terms of the saturation in the leaves, but as for the distracted guy in the middle, there's plenty of detail in both the facial hair and the patterned sweater. 
Neither camera offers the type of breakthrough that would compel someone to jump ecosystems just for camera performance. An iPhone owner is far more likely to upgrade to the iPhone 17 Pro from an older iPhone, for example. Both are top quality, and the strengths of each come down mostly to your preference for the operating system. In the case of the iPhone 17 Pro versus the Pixel 10 Pro XL, the differences turn out not to be drastic. (If you're an Android owner looking to move up based on photo quality, I recommend revisiting my look at the Pixel 10 Pro XL vs. the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.) 
That said, I was surprised to find the Pixel's performance to be more muted and naturalistic in general; often it's the Android phone that pushes the saturation and contrast too high (or maybe that's just the Galaxy S25 Ultra). There are other factors beyond sensor and image quality that might compel you to pick the Pixel, such as the Gemini integration that enables photo editing via voice commands, or the ability to capture images at 100x and then use generative AI to reconstruct details that would otherwise be fuzzy. 
However, although both phones have great cameras, I prefer the iPhone 17 Pro's overall performance."

Ensemble Health, a major player in healthcare revenue management, is seeking a potential $13 billion sale or IPO next year, Business Insider has learned.
Ensemble, owned primarily by private equity firms Warburg Pincus and Berkshire Partners, has tapped JPMorgan to pursue a sale, five people with knowledge of the deal told Business Insider.
At the same time, Ensemble is considering an IPO and has pulled in Goldman Sachs to support the dual-track approach, three of the people said.
It's aiming for a valuation of around $13 billion in either deal, according to those people.
Ensemble is the latest PE-backed healthtech company to plan a major sale or IPO for early next year in a sluggish venture-backed healthcare IPO market.
Tech has enjoyed a number of blockbuster VC-backed IPOs this year, from Figma to Klarna. But regulatory and market uncertainties, plus higher standards for IPO candidates, have pushed back the hopeful go-public dates of many healthcare startups compared to their profitable PE-backed peers.
Ensemble Health hasn't begun accepting bids and won't kick off that process until the first quarter of 2026, multiple people told Business Insider. Ensemble is now bringing in about $700 million in earnings before expenses like tax and interest, the people said.
The Financial Times previously reported in May that Ensemble was considering a sale that could value it up to $12 billion. It's now aiming for a higher price, multiple people said.
JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs declined to comment for this story. Ensemble Health didn't respond to requests for comment.
The ""dual-track"" process— considering a sale and an IPO at the same time — has become common among healthcare companies seeking an exit, multiple people told Business Insider. For some companies, exploring M&A and IPO possibilities at the same time affords more flexibility to companies and their shareholders in times of volatile M&A or IPO markets.
The approach can also help the selling company create competitive tension to drum up hype and increase its price tag.
Venture-backed Hinge Health and Omada Health both made their public market debuts earlier this year, after Business Insider first reported their IPO plans in mid-2024.
But no healthcare startups have tried to follow in their footsteps since then, and no concrete plans for 2026 IPOs from the VC-backed cohort have emerged.
Founded in 2014, Ensemble Health sells software to help hospitals collect more revenue, using AI and other analytics tools to reduce claim denials and speed up payments.
Ensemble previously planned to IPO in 2021, but withdrew its IPO in November 2021 shortly before its IPO shares were priced, citing adverse market conditions.
The next year, Berkshire Partners and Warburg Pincus bought a majority stake in Ensemble from Golden Gate Capital. That deal valued Ensemble at over $5 billion.
Companies like Ensemble Health are rushing to apply AI to back-end healthcare tasks in the face of healthcare's labor crisis and declining reimbursements. That fervor has led to billions of dollars in revenue cycle management deals in the past year.
Public revenue cycle management company Waystar bought Iodine Software for $1.25 billion this month. PE firms TowerBrook and CD&R acquired then-public R1 RCM in an $8.9 billion deal in November 2024. PE firm New Mountain Capital bought SmarterDx, previously backed by Transformation Capital and Bessemer Venture Partners, and combined it with two other companies in May in a revenue-cycle rollup valued at $6 billion.
While most major healthcare RCM companies are owned by private equity firms or insurers, healthcare VC has seen numerous unicorns minted this year as investors pour money into AI startups tackling administrative tasks.
AI scribe startups Abridge and Ambience both crossed the $1 billion valuation mark in their individual fundraises this year, with Abridge's valuation jumping to $5.3 billion after its second funding round of 2025. Both companies have said they plan to dig further into medical coding and billing as incumbents like medical records giant Epic encroach on AI scribing.
Medical AI search startup OpenEvidence hit a $6 billion valuation this week in its third funding round of the year. The first of those rounds, in February, had boosted its valuation to $1 billion.

The orignal Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones are aptly named, offering plush comfort, good sound, and the best noise canceling we’d ever tested upon their release. They stood as the unequivocal noise-canceling masters until Sony rivaled their dominance with the WH-1000XM6, which brings new tech like a crazy-fast chipset to inch past the Ultra in some scenarios.
The QuietComfort Ultra 2 improve upon the original, though this is a minor update with very similar noise-canceling and audio performance. Frankly, a more accurate name would be the Ultra Gen 1.2 or 1.3, but I suppose that’s not as catchy.
There are some slick new touches, including some new app controls, convenience features like the ability to lay the headphones flat to sleep them, and lossless audio support over USB-C. The upgrades come at a relatively low cost—especially since Bose jacked up the price of its previous best headphones from $430 to $450 post-launch (they’re now back to $430). I wouldn’t trade up if you own the original, but if you’re torn between which to get, the newer version have some good reasons for the minor splurge.
The Ultra 2nd Gen's look and feel are virtually identical to the original. That means sleek lines along the chassis, minimalist controls, and cushy pads cloaked in plush protein leather that feel inviting and luxurious.

As I noted in my original QC Ultra review, the ear cups are on the small side, creating a snug fit that feels almost bespoke to me but may not work as well for larger ears. The band and cups are well balanced and provide enough cushion for hours (and hours) of comfy listening, an important bar to clear for any travel cans. They’re more comfortable than the WH-1000XM6 for my money, one of my few knocks against Sony’s latest flagship.
The only aesthetic difference in the new Ultra is the polished metal finish around the ear cup arms (or yokes) in place of the original’s glittery matte look. I’m not sure it’s an upgrade—the new look leaves a lot more room for fingerprints—but it is a bit flashier.
While Bose notes some minor tuning to the sound, noise canceling, and transparency modes, this update is mostly about convenience features. I wasn’t bowled over by the minor tweaks on paper, but in practice, the headphones are surprisingly more inviting to use.
That starts with multiple ways to enter and exit low-power mode. The Gen 2 will shut down after 30 minutes at rest, but you can now lay them flat to disconnect from your source, then simply put them back on to listen. The functionality is similar to Apple’s AirPods Max, but better executed. Unlike the Max, you’re still getting a power key (and a real case), but the ability to slip them on and off so easily for playback is really handy. Bose claims the headphones can last for months in low power, so we’ll continue long-term testing.

Speaking of battery, there’s a slight boost from the original's 24 hours to 30 hours of playback with noise canceling (24 with Immersive Audio). You can now listen while they charge and access lossless audio tracks over USB-C from supported sources, something neither the original Ultra nor Sony’s XM6 offer.
Bose has also made it easier to control noise canceling and transparency modes, letting you switch off ambient audio completely in the app or customize how much sound is blocked or piped in from the microphones under Noise Control. Previously, this required creating a Custom sound mode.
Otherwise, you’re getting the same solid feature set, with options like multipoint audio connection (still for just two devices), adaptive sound that tailors performance to your ears, and settings like the ability to adjust your own voice for calls. Onboard controls include power and multi-function keys, and a touch sensor volume slider, which is still a bit less responsive than I’d like.
There are a few outstanding features still on my wish list, like a multi-band EQ rather than the more basic three-band setup, which makes tailoring the booming default bass more hatchet than scalpel. Auracast audio sharing would have been nice, even if it is more future-looking.
Testing the latest Ultra against the Gen 1 and Sony XM6 over several days mostly just reminded me how incredible all of them are at suppressing sound. All three pairs sit at the top of the market, besting anything else we’ve tested, and most people are unlikely to notice any major differences in performance in most situations.

The Sony’s biggest advantage is its ultra-fast response, adjusting to different frequencies across the spectrum faster than both Bose pairs. The Ultra 2 weren’t much faster (if at all) than the original at adjusting to sounds like airplane drones or crowd noises in my home studio, but Bose did tone down the white noise created by the noise cancellation itself. That was immediately noticeable in a quiet room, though the noise creeps back up again with louder sounds.
As with the original, the Ultra 2's transparency mode (aka Aware) is nearly as impressive as their noise suppression. Their 10 microphones provide natural reproduction of both my own voice and ambient sounds. They worked brilliantly on a dog walk with my wife, letting me comfortably chat as I enjoyed my tunes in the background.
One other point Bose emphasized is an update to the Ultra 2's ActiveSense feature that quells sudden loud noises when using the Aware mode, now designed for “smoother” transitions. This means quick sounds like a clap or car door can (and do) slip through, but when I turned on my vacuum, it added some noise canceling after a few seconds to soften the whine.
There’s little difference between the original Ultra’s default audio performance and the new model, and that’s mostly a good thing. You’ll get clear and crisp detail alongside engaging instrumental textures across genres. Bass is again more upfront than I’d like by default, but lowering it a few notches in the EQ helps even things out, and songs where it's properly emphasized sound big and bold. Crisp percussive instruments, like a clap beat in a hip-hop track or a tight guitar click, seem to have a bit more definition in the treble, but it's very close.

I generally prefer the warmer and more natural-sounding XM6, but the Ultra’s more exuberant approach is a fun listen, and does an excellent job placing instruments in space to surround you in sound. Listening for hours over the last week was a keen reminder of how good all genres sound against a nearly silent backdrop, a big reason the best noise cancelers are so appealing.
I’m not a big fan of the new Cinema mode, any more than I was of Bose’s Immersive Audio. Cinema effectively puts dialog up front, but like Immersive mode, it adds some odd digital echo. To be fair, I feel the same about Sony’s Cinema mode, and Bose’s version could be helpful for those with trouble hearing dialog. Bose's optional head-tracking feature does a good job making scenes feel more like a home entertainment setup.
Call performance is once again impressive, effectively suppressing ambient sounds for the listener, and I always appreciate the ability to adjust my own voice to make calls feel more natural.
It’s the Ultra 2's new convenience features that really stand out, making it easier than ever to pop in and out of my tunes during the average workday. That alone won't be worth an upgrade, but the 2nd Gen's mix of convenience, comfort, and performance makes them a great new option atop the noise-canceling stack.

The recent failures of auto lender Tricolor and auto-parts manufacturer First Brands, which JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon dubbed ""cockroaches,"" had the biggest names on Wall Street pointing fingers last week.
Blackstone has been paying attention too, but on its third-quarter earnings call on Thursday, the company had a clear message: any attempts to tie these bankruptcies to private credit are fake news.
""These events have been erroneously linked to the traditional private credit market as a result of misunderstandings and misinformation,"" said Steve Schwarzman, the chief executive of the world's largest private investment firm.
Schwarzman blamed the ""bank-led and bank-syndicated credits, not private credit,"" referencing the more than $2 billion in asset-backed securities arranged by Barclays and JPMorgan for subprime auto-lender Tricolor, and loans syndicated by Jefferies and others for auto-parts maker First Brands.
And even though ""we'll see some increases in defaults"" because of the late-credit cycle, these bankruptcies ""are widely believed to involve the fraudulent pledging of the same collateral to multiple parties,"" Schwarzman said.
In other words, ""this really isn't a private credit story,"" said Blackstone president Jon Gray, noting that the specific circumstances of these bankruptcies don't speak to credit more broadly. Gray said he doesn't see ""any sort of pullback from the banks,"" and that ""the markets have concluded that this was pretty isolated.""The firm's stock price is down more than 5%, trading at $152.50 as of midmorning on Thursday.
The firm's investors appear to have been optimistic about credit over the last quarter, too, even as interest rates (and yield) are dropping. The firm's non-real estate credit assets under management increased to $432.3 billion, with $36 billion in inflows in the period.With real estate credit factored in, Blackstone now manages $500 billion in credit, up 18% from a year ago, Gray said. Credit is its largest asset class, making up around 40% of its $1.24 trillion in total assets under management.  
In the third quarter, retail investors poured money into credit, with $3.6 billion in inflows to BCRED, Blackstone's perpetual credit vehicle for wealthy individuals, and the firm's largest private wealth vehicle with nearly $85 billion in AUM. When asked if the chatter around a possible credit crisis would hurt the firm's fundraising from private wealth channels, Gray said that the firm expects ""strong flows in credit in November,"" even as the yield goes down amid a lower cost of capital from the Fed.
Lower rates will mean lower returns for investors. For example, BCRED, has a ""97% floating rate,"" Gray said, meaning the yield on its loans moves with the Fed's lending rate and rises when rates are higher. Still, the selling point is that they outperform the public market, Gray said.
The firm reported 2.6% returns for private credit (1.8% net of fees) in the quarter and 1.6% (1.5% net of fees) returns for liquid credit in the quarter.
A late-cycle credit market may mean ""some increases in defaults,"" Schwarzman said, but he rattled off the firm's track record to inspire confidence in its ability to beat the market.He noted that annual losses have averaged just 0.1%, even during the global financial crisis.
""And our investment-grade focused private credit platform in BXCI has experienced zero realized losses to date,"" Schwarzman said.

We are asking readers and listeners for their questions about all things homeownership and renting. Today, we're answering one of them. Submit your question below.
Bidding wars may be cooling and mortgage rates could dip below 6% next year. But the shortage of ""starter homes"" — smaller, more affordable houses — continues to lock many would-be first-time buyers out of the market.
Gabriel Veasey, a reader in Central Texas, has children who live near Austin, Texas. They've been hunting for their first home but can't find anything affordable. He asked:
Why can't they have the opportunity to buy the starter homes – the two bedroom, $200,000 [home] that's just what they need, instead of a three [bed], two [bath] or four [bed], three [bath] home for $400,000 to $500,000 that's just not within their range? … Where can my kids go? Why can't they have that opportunity to find a starter home?
The math doesn't work in their favor. The median income in Austin is about $134,000 — enough for a mortgage of roughly $350,000. But in September, the median home price in Austin was about $560,000, according to Zillow. ""If you're a median income earner in the region, you can't afford to buy a house in the city of Austin,"" says local builder Scott Turner.
Although it has slowed somewhat in recent years, Austin remains among the fastest-growing metros in the country and home prices have reflected that boomtown energy. But the city's housing crunch mirrors a national trend, says Mike Loftin, the CEO of Homewise, a New Mexico-based organization committed to helping first-time homebuyers. He points to Albuquerque, the largest city in his state, as an example.
""Ten years ago in Albuquerque, between 2014 and 18, about 20% of all new homes built in Albuquerque would be considered an entry-level home, a smaller, more affordable home. Today, that number is 4%,"" Loftin says. ""And this is true across the country. Home builders are not building that entry-level home.""
For decades, construction of these smaller homes has been falling across the country. In the 1980s, they represented about 40% of the market, but by 2023, that percentage had dropped to just 12%.
Turner says the rising cost of materials is one big reason builders are shying away from the affordable end of the market, where the profit margins are lower. ""A home that maybe used to cost $300,000 to build now costs about $450,000,"" he says, citing a 40% increase in construction materials since about 2020. The added costs from tariffs on Canadian lumber and other construction materials are expected to tack on another 7% to 10% to building costs, he says.
What's more, many people who bought or refinanced during the COVID-19 pandemic are reluctant to give up low mortgage rates — as low as 3% — to move up into a house they would have to buy at closer to 6%. As a result, those starter homes aren't being recycled for a new generation of first-time buyers.
Going back to Gabriel: The problems for his kids in Austin largely are zoning and red tape. Until two years ago, much of Austin was zoned exclusively for single-family homes, and once had one of the largest minimum lot sizes in the state, Turner says. Now, property owners can build up to three homes on what used to be a single-family lot, making room for more entry-level homes. But the biggest barrier to creating affordable housing remains the city's slow and expensive approval process for the construction of townhomes, condos, and new subdivisions, which can take up to two years regardless of the size of the project, he says.
Turner points to Houston as a model of how to get more starter homes built — through deregulation. ""Back in the 90s, Houston started to allow very small lots … throughout its urban core and to this day, you can still go down to Houston and live in the middle of town, and still find a townhome for $400,000.""
To be sure, some existing homeowners haven't embraced zoning changes that promote new construction. Among other things, they argue that without formal zoning, industrial, commercial and residential uses would come into undesirably close proximity. In Austin, for instance, they have in the past successfully sued to block such changes.
Assuming that mortgage rates do come down, there will likely be some movement in this lower end of the market, Loftin says. Being ready when the market changes is key, and he says that Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) such as his — and there are many across the country — can help.
""We do the assessment, then we do an action plan to address the barriers that you have,"" he says. ""What's the game plan for improving your credit? It's not rocket science. It's helpful because we know the system.""
""Building a savings habit where you just have your employer just automatically deposit something, every paycheck into your savings account is super, super helpful,"" he adds. And prospective buyers don't have to put down a large amount of money, either. ""Our typical down payment from a home buyer is about 2% of the purchase price, and that includes the closing costs.""
Housing advocates have proposed initiatives aimed at increasing the number of starter homes built, though even if approved, they could take years to make a dent in the problem. There's no national plan, but states are trying out different approaches. Last year, Utah's Republican-dominated legislature passed a bill to provide $300 million in subsidized loans for builders and new city zoning tools in an effort to boost the construction of smaller, no-frills housing.
Homewise has also proposed ""New Homes for New Mexico,"" to provide around $30,000 in direct assistance to potential homebuyers that could lower the purchase price and encourage the construction of more homes in the $300,000 range. Loftin says for builders, the subsidy means ""more buyers that can afford that home now, even with the interest rates we have today."" New Mexico's legislature plans to take up the measure in January, Loftin says, adding that it ""appears to be gaining significant support.""
Meanwhile, even without such measures, there are things that you can do to maximize your chances of finding a starter home that fits your budget — but those options do come with compromises.
Harrison Beacher, a realtor in the Washington, D.C.-area, says he tells clients to look at home buying as a Venn diagram comparing what you want with what you can afford, where you want to live and other must-haves.
""Too many people wait for the 'dream home,' when what really changes their long-term financial story is simply getting started and making thoughtful, strategic moves over time,"" Beacher says.
""A true starter home is not about checking every box on your wish list. It is about identifying the right combination of location, affordability, and potential for appreciation,"" he says. ""You want to be close enough to the things that matter for your lifestyle and career, while staying within a price point that allows you to grow into your home instead of being stretched by it.""
Finding that perfect entry-level home might involve something realtors refer to as ""driving until you qualify,"" Turner says. In other words, if you can't find something affordable, keep looking further from the city until you can.
The median home price in Austin may be way too high, but the city of Bastrop, about 30 miles southeast of Austin, is much more affordable, he says. He says the median price of a home in Bastrop in July was $336,000, about 40% lower than Austin.
And for Gabriel's kids, it might make sense to look outside Austin, where homes are more affordable, and buy something now — even if it's not their dream home. Over time, they can build equity and use it to move closer to the city and what they really want.

7,2025-10-23,"If you want to run faster or farther, you have options. You can put in the work, getting up 40 minutes earlier to train, changing your diet, going harder and longer on each of your runs to build up strength.
Or, you can strap on one of Nike's new robot shoes and mechanically boost your speed, your stamina, and your overall performance in a flash. Sounds way easier, and probably more fun too.
Today the footwear giant unveiled Project Amplify, an early design of a powered footwear system that Nike technicians are still developing with the goal of a commercial release in 2028.
Amplify has a few parts. At the top, an elastic cuff containing a ring of batteries fits onto the wearer's calf. Attached to the battery array is a mechanical arm that points downward, with the thickest part sitting over the outside of the ankle. That thick part is where the motor lives, and that motor drives a hinged piece that's attached to the heel of the shoe.
The shoe itself is a run-walk shoe with a carbon plate and modern Nike looks. (The company says you can detach the shoes and wear them sans motorized appliance; helpful for when the batteries need recharging.)
At the end of each step, the motor pulls up on the heel of the shoe. The device is calibrated so the movement of the motor can match the natural movement of each person's ankle and lower leg. The result is that each step is powered, or given a little bit of a spring and an extra push by the robot mechanism.
Nike doesn't expect that competitive athletes or distance runners will be able to strap these on and start shaving minutes off their marathon times. Rather, the device is meant to boost the movement of people who are thoroughly middle-of-the road runners or joggers. Nike cites the 10- to 12-minute miler as Project Amplify's eventual target market. The company says a device like this will give the gentle assist necessary to help those folks either improve their overall fitness or help them endure longer distances while they're on runs. It's also being designed for everyday walkers and people who are on their feet for long stretches, basically giving any human the ability to stay mobile longer and with more comfort.
Nike has been developing Project Amplify for years; here are some prototypes.
As we've seen with other performance and accessibility devices—exoskeletons for athletes, motorized braces for soldiers and laborers, and electrified skates for busy walkers—the technological enhancements they provide have typically focused on bettering the bodies we were born with, rather than replacing skills or ability earned through training and hard work. But strong-willed workers, adventurers, or athletes who are already performing at a decent level can strap on one of these robotic helpers and stay on the job, on the road, or in the game longer than they otherwise would.
Nike is developing Project Amplify with the Massachusetts robotics company Dephy (which makes its own bionic footwear) and testing it with athletes in the outdoors and at Nike's innovation lab in Beaverton, Oregon. And while you won't be able to buy these robo-shoes for a few more years, Nike has also unveiled a few things alongside Amplify that you can buy much sooner.
If you like the look of that shoe, you'll be able to detach the motorized arm and wear them as regular sneaks.
The brand is putting out its first ""neuroscience-based"" footwear line, called Mind. The shoes have 22 foam nubs on each sole which press into the wearer's foot as they walk around. The company says this helps the wearer feel the surface below them much like a barefoot shoe—imparting the same benefits of the “grounded” feeling people get from a barefoot design—while also offering the full protection of a cushy and firm shoe. It's the first product to emerge from Nike's Mind Science Department, which researches and develops designs that provide mental as well as physical support. Two Mind designs will be available starting in January.
There's also a new line of cooling and sweat-wicking athletic apparel called Aero-Fit, which Nike says is its first collection of performance apparel made entire from textile waste that's been chemically recycled. Aero-Fit soccer jerseys will make their debut in summer 2026, and chances are you'll be able to buy them around the time you see them on the pitch.

Home security used to mean signing expensive contracts with professional monitoring companies, paying installation fees and dealing with clunky equipment bolted to your walls. Ring changed that equation entirely by putting professional-grade security into a DIY package that anyone can install in an afternoon: The Ring Alarm 14-piece kit gives you comprehensive coverage for a typical 2 to 4 bedroom home, and right now it’s down to just $198 on Amazon, slashed from its regular $329 price (40% off). This is an all-time low for a complete system that would cost you thousands in installation fees and monthly contracts with traditional security companies.
See at Amazon
This 14-piece system comes fully equipped with everything you’ll need to construct a strong security network all the way through your home. You get one base station, the system’s central brain, which connects all of your sensors and communicates through your smartphone via your home Wi-Fi network. Two keypads allow you to arm and disarm the system from two locations which is absolutely convenient where you have entries on different floors or want one on the bedroom for nighttime arming.
Eight contact sensors cover your doors and windows and they sense the exact moment the door or window gets opened. Two motion detectors provide extra security by detecting movement inside your home, catching burglars who would go around the entryways. You get a range extender so your signal gets through every corner of your home, even though your home has solid construction or your sensors are significantly far from the base station.
The contact sensor are simple but effective devices that mount in seconds using adhesive strips, avoiding any need for drilling or wiring. Each sensor has two parts: one attaches to the door or window frame, the other to the moving part. A magnetic connection keeps them talking to each other, and the moment that connection breaks because a door opens, the alarm triggers.
Motion detectors cover larger spaces like hallways, living rooms or basements: They use passive infrared technology to detect heat signatures from moving bodies, giving you interior protection even if someone manages to enter without triggering a contact sensor. The detection angle is wide enough to monitor an entire room from a corner mount, and they’re smart enough to distinguish between your pet cat and an actual person, reducing false alarms.
You get automatic cell phone notifications the second any sensor activates through the Ring app. You’ll be able to disarm and arm the system from your computer, view the status of the individual sensors, and view your security history to know definitively when doors opened or motion occurred. The app interface is intuitive and responsive, providing you total command anywhere you have cell reception.
It works seamlessly with AlexaÂ so you are able to arm or disarm by issuing commands through any Echo device using your voice. Simple commands such as “Alexa, arm Ring Alarm in away mode” handle the whole procedure all by themselves. This voice integration becomes second nature soonÂ whenever your grocery-stuffed hands are full or you are going to bed.
At $198 for complete coverage of a multi-bedroom home, this beats the economics of traditional security systems by a landslide.

	Young adults are told to beware of high-potency cannabis, yet when they walk into a dispensary, that is almost all they find. The market has become a competition of numbers, THC percentages climbing like stock tickers, potency sold as prestige. There were choices once offered in jars of fragrant flowers: lavender, citrus, pine, hay and spices. These have been replaced by an endless monotone of heavy-handed highs.

	Elderly consumers, who might seek gentle relief for aches or the comfort of a familiar ritual, are left stranded. Where is the mild varietal that recalls an afternoon garden, the smoke that relaxes without disorienting? Where is the option to enjoy cannabis as a companion, not a conqueror?

	Even younger consumers who crave community and conversation find little accommodation. They do not want to be knocked flat after a single puff. They want to linger, to share, to laugh. Have an experience close to sipping wine than downing grain alcohol.

	But the system is not designed for them. Society waves a finger: Beware the strong stuff. The industry shrugs and says: It’s the only thing we sell. Regulations reward what can be quantified and monetized: the highest THC number on the label. Industry follows the incentives, producing products that grow ever stronger, ever less diverse. Consumers are caught in a paradox; the warnings are everywhere, yet the alternatives are nowhere.

	










	This is not a new story. Tobacco, once a genus of abundance, included an estimated seventy species, all native to the Americas. Several of which were historically smoked, chewed, snorted or even “drunk.” That diversity has been stripped away. Today, the market is dominated by ever-more concentrated and convenient formats, culminating in vapes that deliver nicotine with pharmaceutical precision.

	










	Alcohol tells a similar tale, though with a few more hopeful twists. Beer and spirits still span a wide spectrum, though not as wide as they once did. Regulation made highly pure spirits a sustainable reality: whiskey often sold straight from the barrel was adulterated by unscrupulous merchants with cheap spirits or toxic substances. Laws and standardization brought safety but also transformed whiskey into an everyday commodity. Copyright and trademark protections created virtual monopolies over certain drinks (“steam beers,” for instance), while homogenizing what had once been a riot of local styles. The modern craft beer revival suggests that consumer appetite for nuance can return.

	Opioids illustrate the point most starkly. For much of the twentieth century, their use was carefully tiered: codeine for a cough, morphine for surgery, heroin once (disastrously) prescribed as a “safer” substitute. Then came fentanyl in the 1950s, created not by cartels but by a doctor at his startup Janssen Pharmaceutica, which was later absorbed by Johnson & Johnson in 1961. He was driven by the ambition to design the most potent narcotic analgesic possible. Fentanyl’s origin story underscores the uncomfortable truth: it was regulation and the Pharma marketplace, not the Sinaloa Cartel, that pushed opioids to their modern extremes.

	In each case — tobacco, alcohol, opioids — the middle ground eroded. And in each case, it was regulation, not the illicit market, that pushed products toward greater purity and thus potency. Legal frameworks tend to simplify and standardize, rewarding what is measurable and marketable, which often translates into “stronger.”

	Cannabis is following the same path. The moderate, the flavorful, the low-dose flower, the “session beer” of cannabis, has vanished. In its place is a monoculture of ever-stronger products, optimized not for experience but for numbers.

	And yet, science tells us that less can often be more. Large doses of pure cannabinoids are consistently linked to adverse events: anxiety, paranoia, cognitive impairment, disrupted sleep, even paradoxical increases in pain. Lower doses, by contrast, often strike the sweet spot with far fewer risks. The best deals for consumers, and the best outcomes for public health, come not from chasing THC percentages but from embracing moderation.
The Rolling Stone Culture Council is an invitation-only community for Influencers, Innovators and Creatives. Do I qualify?











	It is time to re-educate cannabis consumers: the best deal in cannabis isn’t the highest THC percentage. The best deal is the product that gives the most enjoyment, the most relief, with the fewest side effects. That generally mean slower potency cannabis. Cannabis is not a hurricane, where more force means more cleansing. It is not a blunt instrument where “stronger” equals “better.” 

	This is a market failure. Public health officials warn of potency while dispensary shelves offer little else. Consumers such as young adults seeking sociability or elderly patients seeking relief, and everyone in between, are denied the option to choose products aligned with responsible use.

	If lower-potency products were widely available, people could use more responsibly and, importantly, decrease their use more easily when they wanted to. That’s not just a consumer preference; it’s a public health win.

	Think of it like beer. Not every day calls for a 14 percent triple IPA. Most evenings call for pilsners, light beers, lagers — products designed for sociability, moderation and steady enjoyment. Cannabis should offer the same spectrum: products to savor, not just endure.

	There is a wide-open market opportunity for cannabis companies willing to reclaim the middle ground. Develop flavor-first, low-potency product lines: terpene-rich flowers at 5 percent to 10 percent THC, consider balanced blends of hemp and marijuana, and “session joints” designed for sociability rather than obliteration. Brand them for experience, emphasizing aroma and taste, not just potency.

	Such products meet consumer demand for moderation, satisfy regulators calling for safer options, establish a more sustainable cannabis culture and are aligned with clinical research on cannabis products, which consistently show better outcomes with low to moderate potency products (as referenced earlier).

	Consumers deserve better. Young adults deserve choices that don’t feel like Russian roulette. Elderly patients deserve products that soothe without overwhelming. Social users deserve flowers that create space for laughter, not silence.

	Until regulations and industry incentives shift, the market will continue to flatten cannabis into a one-note symphony of strength. But the demand for balance will not disappear.

	The folk song once asked, Where have all the flowers gone? In cannabis, the answer is brutally simple: they have been bred, regulated and monetized out of existence. The path forward requires something equally simple: bring them back, in lower doses, with richer aromas and the promise of responsible use without punishment.

Keeper is a name that comes up a lot when shopping for password managers, largely due to its robust list of certifications—it’s certified for enterprises, government agencies, and medical institutions. Despite a clear focus on large-scale credential management, it’s still a pretty dang good password manager for personal use.
Intuitive apps, plenty of features, and easily the best sharing system I’ve seen top the charts for Keeper, keeping it in lockstep with competitors like 1Password and Proton Pass. However, it loses a few points due to higher pricing and the odd choice to charge extra for dark web monitoring, a feature that’s included for free with most of its peers.
Like NordPass and 1Password, Keeper offers personal and commercial plans, the latter of which I won’t be focusing on for this review. On the personal plans, there are three options: Free, Unlimited, and Family. It’s great to see a free plan in the aftermath of LastPass’s data breaches, especially since 1Password and Dashlane offer no free option. But Keeper’s free plan is just too restrictive to be useful.

It’s only available on a single mobile device. You can’t use the extension, and you can’t sync your entries. You can store credit cards and identities, but you’re limited to just 10 entries for passwords and/or passkeys. If you’re looking for a free password manager, Proton Pass is the best because it supports syncing across devices, but NordPass is a good option, as well.
Unlimited is what most people interested in Keeper should go for. It's where you get unlimited storage, multi-device sync, and access to customer support (something not available on the free plan). Keeper has steadily raised prices over the past few years, but it’s now in line with other password managers. You’ll pay $40 per user, per year. 1Password and Proton Pass are a touch cheaper at $36 per year, but Keeper costs less than Dashlane ($60 per year).
The Family plan is a bit higher than I’d like it to be. You get five private vaults and 10 GB of shared encrypted storage for $85 per year. 1Password comes with the same number of vaults for $60, while NordPass clocks in at $72 for six accounts. Keeper’s Family plan even struggles compared to Dashlane, which will run you $90 per year, but for 10 accounts.
I’m not splitting hairs over a few dollars here or there. Keeper’s pricing is largely in line with the rest of the market, but it leans toward the more expensive end of the range. My main issue with pricing is what Keeper calls “secure add-ons.” Those add-ons include BreachWatch, Keeper's dark web monitoring tool, and additional secure storage. Neither is included with Keeper Unlimited. You need to pay $25 per year for BreachWatch, and $13 for 10 GB of file storage, or up to $100 per year for 100 GB.

Except for NordPass, most password managers don’t offer multiyear discounts, but Keeper does. You’ll save 20 percent on two years and 30 percent on three, which makes these add-ons much more palatable. Still, features like dark web monitoring and secure storage are standard with services like Proton Pass and 1Password, and they’re paid add-ons with Keeper.
Setting up my account with Keeper started like any other password manager. I exported my list of entries from another password manager—in this case, Proton Pass—and imported the 600 or so records into Keeper. Like most other password managers, Keeper allows you to import a generic CSV file, as well as CSV files from specific services like Proton Pass, 1Password, or Dashlane.
For all of these services, Keeper includes instructions for exporting your passwords, as well as a reminder to delete the exported file to prevent storing plaintext passwords. The problem is how Keeper reads CSV files. When you select a file, you’re shown a table with the fields Keeper automatically matched. It easily picked up on the names of different records, as well as my username/email and the password. Any additional fields were a struggle.
For instance, I store some time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) with logins, and those weren’t properly identified. Thankfully, you can scroll through and change the category for each column in the table to get everything to line up before importing.
That only solves some of the problems with importing into Keeper. Although Keeper gives you up to 26 custom fields to help organize your entries during the import process, it doesn’t recognize entries that aren’t logins. That led to some odd organization of notes, credit cards, and addresses, with many of them showing up as a login record with no username or password, just raw CSV data in the “Notes” section.

This is frustrating because Keeper supports separate entries for things like credit cards and addresses. They just aren’t recognized during the import process properly, which is something other password managers, such as 1Password, don’t struggle with. Thankfully, I was only left with about a dozen entries I had to create from scratch. The vast majority of entries I have are passwords, and they were picked up properly.
Like most password managers, you’ll mainly interact with Keeper in your browser. KeeperFill, which is the name of Keeper’s extension, is available in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and even Brave, while the desktop application is available on Windows, macOS, and popular Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Mint, and CentOS. The desktop apps are largely a mirror of the web application, so I spent most of my time in the browser.

Keeper offers a lot through its browser extension, but the first and most important aspect of a password manager is auto-fill, and Keeper does a fairly good job. When it comes to filling logins, Keeper is perfect. I never once found a field it didn’t recognize, and unlike LastPass, Keeper didn’t shoot out false positives on text fields it shouldn’t auto-fill. Password capture was perfect, as well. In most cases, Keeper popped up and asked if I wanted to save a login, but it also allows you to manually trigger this process if a record isn’t available for the website you’re on.
Auto-fill for credit cards and logins wasn’t as flawless. Keeper didn’t always show up in the credit card and address fields, though it popped up on the latter more than the former. If I could get the Keeper auto-fill window to appear, it worked well, but that would only happen on certain pages, like a checkout page where there’s also space to log into your account.
This isn’t a problem unique to Keeper. 1Password doesn’t always recognize identity and credit card fields, either. However, 1Password includes a button in the extension that allows you to auto-fill anyway, and Keeper doesn’t. I’d love to see that function in Keeper in a future update. On mobile, similar issues with auto-fill show up, but that’s largely an issue with mobile devices. Keeper worked well in applications, but auto-fill is always a bit spotty in mobile browsers.
Although auto-fill isn’t perfect, Keeper’s browser extension is still excellent, mainly because of how many options it has. With most password managers, you need to open the web app to change any serious settings, but Keeper gives you a lot of control directly from the extension. You can set up clipboard expiration, turn on biometric authentication (even on desktop), and change the capture prompt location. You can change the layout of the extension, either showing a longer portrait mode or a shorter landscape mode. You don’t see that kind of flexibility often.

On the desktop, Keeper mirrors what you’ll find in the web app, though with one notable change. You can turn on offline mode. Keeper isn’t the only password manager to support offline mode, but it’s front and center in the app. You’ll also find a manual sync button, which is a small addition that does wonders if you’re constantly swapping between devices.
Keeper focuses heavily on credential management for enterprises, and some of that focus has clearly worked its way down to the consumer product. Sharing is excellent, and to understand why, we need to start with records.

Everything stored in your Keeper vault is known as a record. There are several different record types, including logins, credit cards, identities, secure notes, and software licenses, but you can also create a general record with any fields you want, as well as add custom fields and attach files to other record types. Rather than tags or categories, Keeper lets you make folders, and you nest folders within each other.
You can share at a record or folder level. Record sharing speaks for itself, but folder sharing is interesting. Rather than sharing a full vault, as you have to do with a service like Proton Pass, you can create a shared folder with a permission structure similar to Google Drive. You can set your records to view only, give shared users editing access, and even allow users to add and manage other users.
These sharing settings aren’t strictly global. You can set up a view-only shared folder, but give some users the ability to manage users and/or records, and you can change the permissions on individual records within that folder. Some records can be view-only, while others can be unlocked for editing.
You can share individual records in a few ways. You can share them in perpetuity, but you can also create one-time share links for non-Keeper users. Access is limited to one device through that link. If you need something even more temporary, you can create a self-destruct record, which will be shared and then deleted shortly after the record is opened.
Keeper uses a zero-knowledge, zero-trust security architecture. Each record you store in Keeper is encrypted individually with its own AES-256 key. Those keys are then wrapped in another AES-256 key, which is derived from your master password. Even if someone were to break your AES-256 key–not likely–that wouldn’t unlock your individual records.
All encryption happens locally, so Keeper never sees your vault data, and it doesn’t have the keys to decrypt it (read our passkey explainer for more on public-key encryption and how zero-knowledge models work). That gives you full end-to-end encryption, and to make extra sure nothing can happen in transit, Keeper generates an additional AES-256 transmission key to protect the data from man-in-the-middle attacks.
A zero-knowledge security architecture and several layers of encryption are expected from a password manager, but what stands out about Keeper is how transparent it is about its security architecture. Likely due to its enterprise focus, Keeper maintains extensive documentation about how it works and the protections in place.
Keeper has a lot of tools for operational security. In the browser extension, for example, there’s a clipboard expiration setting that defaults to 30 seconds. Anything you copy will be automatically cleared. There’s also a warning that will automatically display if you attempt to autofill on an HTTP address, blocking your credentials from traveling over an unsecured network.
Keeper’s enterprise focus surprisingly works well for personal use. The security architecture is top-notch, the apps come packed with features, and the sharing capabilities are second to none. Where Keeper loses out is pricing. Although its pricing is in line with the rest of the market for a single user, it’s a bit high for a family plan. And features that come standard with other password managers, such as dark web monitoring, are paid add-ons.

Counter Strike 2Valve 
If you play Counter-Strike 2 and enjoy trading skins for financial gain, youâre either real happy right now or, um, quite the opposite. Valve recently pushed an update to the gameâs controversial marketplace that appears to have wildly shifted the value of some folksâ inventories, gutting the worth of some playersâ stockpiles of skins while skyrocketing that of others. Itâs a dramatic shift triggering a $1.75 billion decrease in value to the market.
The CS2 skins market cap lost $1.75 BILLION following the Knife Trade Up updateâ¼ï¸ pic.twitter.com/wHPCF9wfGq
— Pricempire.com (@pricempire) October 23, 2025

In an update that makes an otherwise ordinary assortment of tweaks, Valve altered the way Counter-Strikeâs skin game works (h/t GamesRadar). The update allows folks to âtrade upâ what were previously seen as borderline worthless cosmetics, referred to as âredâ by the community. These skins were previously worth around $10, but as of the new changes, folks can trade them up for skins worth four digits. Thatâs quite the shift.
Turmoil ensued as these changes rocked the skin market. One player lost $1400 âin the span of 30 minutesâ as the changes mucked up the value of their inventory. Of course, as such things go, others gained a ton of money, sharing screenshots of the massive jump in value of their inventory.

âAt this point just go and gamble at a casino ðâ reads another post. But perhaps the most ridiculous shift in value was @smileybeefâs now nearly four-million-dollar (yes, you read that right) batch of âworthless red skins.â âHow do I explain this to the IRS?â they said. To which one user replied âCan you please launder it harder by buying me a Steam Deck?â Another chimed in saying âeverytime I refresh the market they get more expensive some are at like 3600%.â

It has been 15 years since I first addressed why the “Wealth Effect” is a simple correlation error:
“The basic premise of the wealth effect is well known: As the value of stock portfolios rise during bull markets, investors enjoy a feeling of euphoria. This psychological state makes them feel more comfortable  — about their wealth, about debt, and most of all, about spending and indulgences. The net result, goes the argument, is that consumers spend more, stimulate the economy, thus leading to more jobs and tax revenues. A virtuous cycle is created. The problem is, the theory is mostly nonsense.”   The Big Picture, Nov 16, 2010
It is amazing that the Federal Reserve continues to make policy based on what I argue is a fundamental misunderstanding of both economics and psychology.
No, spending doesn’t go up because stocks are up; rather, the factors that underpin higher consumer spending – increases in employment, wages, credit, and even modest inflation, plus anything else underpinning economic expansion1 – tend to also drive up revenues, profits, investor sentiment, and therefore stock prices.2
But that is only the first half of the Wealth Effect conundrum; the other half is that most people in the country own very little in equities. You have seen the data before: The top 10% own 87% of the stock market while the bottom 90% own just 13%.
Does anyone really believe the stock market is what drives spending for the 90% who only own 13% of equities?
 
There IS a real wealth effect with housing – the bottom 90% own 87% of the houses – pretty close to what you expect. But even those numbers are skewed; the lower half of households – AKA renters – only own 10% of the housing stock. So even the wealth effect of housing is somewhat muted.
What really drives consumer spending higher?
Plentiful jobs, wage increases, economic expansion, labor mobility, and bountiful credit availability have explained the past behavior of consumers. It is not a secular bull market in stocks that causes consumer spending to increase; it is the same contemporaneous elements that power a bull market that also drive spending.
If anyone has persuasive data showing that equity bull markets create a real wealth effect that is more than a correlation, and is genuinely causative, I would love to see it…

When the United States slapped a 241% tariff on Iranian pistachios nearly 40 years ago, it set the stage for one of America's biggest agricultural success stories.
The trade barrier opened the door for small California farmers to build a new homegrown industry. Today, California supplies more than 60% of the world's pistachios, a significant portion of the global pistachio market that's worth an estimated $5.6 billion and projected to grow to over $7 billion by 2030.
The pistachio precedent is an example where tariffs initially worked as intended — protecting an infant industry long enough for it to stand on its own.
However, once the pistachio industry matured, consolidation followed. Only a handful of pistachio processors in California now dominate production.
The same risk looms today for American business owners hoping Trump's tariffs will level the playing field.
In the mid-20th century, Iran dominated global pistachio production, exporting millions of pounds each year, including to America.
By comparison, America's ""industry in pistachios was almost literally non-existent,"" said Bob Keenan, owner of Keenan Farms in California, one of the oldest pistachio processors in the US.
Today, Iran supplies less than a quarter of the global market. That shift and America's pistachio boom might have never happened, however, if it weren't for a key moment in history.
In 1979, during the Iranian Revolution, militants stormed the US Embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage. In response, Washington froze Iranian assets and restricted imports, including pistachios.
Practically overnight, a hole opened in the market for American farmers, and California growers moved quickly to fill it. A lot of like-minded farmers invested their time and resources into building an industry, Keenan told Business Insider's Olivia Nemec.
In 1980, the Sunshine State produced about 27 million pounds of pistachios. That's small by today's standards, but a huge leap from its harvest just four years earlier of 1.5 million pounds.
When the hostages were released in 1981, the embargo was lifted, and Iranian pistachios began flowing back into the US. By then, however, American growers weren't about to let their foothold in the market slip away.
American growers, including Keenan Farms, accused Iran of dumping, or selling below cost to drive out competition. The US International Trade Commission launched an investigation and found that Iran was selling nuts for less than it cost to grow them, a sign that dumping was indeed at play.
California growers ultimately won their case, and in 1986, the US imposed a 241% anti-dumping tariff on Iranian pistachios. ""And that helped our industry grow and become profitable,"" said Keenan, whose business expanded from handling and processing nuts on 100 acres in the '70s to 20,000 today across multiple pistachio growers in the state.
Iran continued exporting to Europe and Asia, but its access to the US was limited. Subsequent sanctions, including the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010, prohibited nearly all imports of Iranian goods, which effectively ended any remaining legal trade in pistachios between the two countries.
As America's pistachio industry matured, small growers laid the groundwork for large companies to scale it. Now, small companies are struggling.
Rebecca Kaser of Avellar-Moore Farms, a small family-run operation in California's Central Valley, said they've had to adapt as droughts worsen and water becomes scarcer. ""We're kind of at the mercy of the elements,"" she said.
Pistachio trees thrive in hot, arid climates, but a mature orchard typically needs over a million gallons of water per acre each year in order to produce any nuts for profit, making them vulnerable in times of drought.
Moreover, pistachios are among the most expensive nuts to grow and can cost about $20,000 per acre before a single nut is produced, and trees can take six years to yield a harvest — twice as long as almond trees.
Kaser and other small farmers have struggled under California's Sustainable Groundwater Management Act of 2014, which limits pumping groundwater from depleted aquifers.
Kaser says she sees the act's importance. ""It was a piece of legislation that was helping us become better stewards of the land. And that's at the heart of what farming is.""
However, it has also meant that Avellar-Moore Farms has had to stop planting on some of its land, a process called fallowing, due to insufficient water.
""We fallowed out over 60% of our farm so that we'd be able to have the water in order to irrigate our plantings,"" Kaser said. Experts warn that up to 900,000 acres of farmland could go out of production by 2040, disproportionately hurting smaller operations without access to private water banks.
Meanwhile, the world's largest pistachio producer — The Wonderful Company, owned by billionaires Stewart and Lynda Resnick — continues to expand thanks to a water bank that the Resnicks own a significant portion of the rights to. The bank relies on surface water, not groundwater, and is less affected by the Groundwater Management Act.
Wonderful Orchards now spans 60,000 acres, roughly four times the size of Manhattan. And its trees produce 20% to 40% more nuts than average with the same amount of water due to selective cloning of its highest-yield crops, Rob Yraceburu, president of Wonderful Orchards, told BI.
That scale gives Wonderful a distinct advantage.

17,2025-10-23,"Extended ""trade-up"" feature crashes the price of knives and gloves
Ah Valve, you awful, giggling vultures. You terrible purveyors of mischief and misfortune. Weeks go past without you making any significant game-related announcements, and then you suddenly dropkick the entire Counter-Strike cosmetics economy into the sun.
The developers have released what they breezily call a ""small update"" for Counter-Strike 2 that, essentially, allows players to exchange five cosmetic items for other items that sell for a lot, lot more over the Counter-Strike player marketplace. As such, they have crashed the price of the latter items and, according to tracking app Price Empire, wiped billions of US dollars off the value of the CS2 skins market.
As passed on by Gamesradar, the update in question extends the functionality of the 'Trade Up Contract', which allows players to swap common ""Covert"" items obtained from purchaseable cases for much rarer knives or gloves, including ""StatTrakTM"" gear that, as the name implies, tracks certain play statistics when equipped. 
The Trade Up contract now lets people exchange five StatTrakTM Covert quality items for ""one StatTrakTM Knife from a collection of one of the items provided"", or five regular Covert items for ""one regular Knife item or one regular Gloves item from a collection of one of the items provided"". The result is that Covert skins have shot up in price, while the price of knives and gloves has plummeted. 
The numbers in question are not tiny. They are in fact quite large. One Covert skin collector says that their 609 hitherto ""worthless red skins"" are now worth £3,329,612 on the marketplace. One respondent comments that ""my knife just dropped $1,400 in value in the span of 30 minutes"". 
Reactions to all this on the Counter-Strike subreddit naturally vary quite a bit, with knife and glove collectors spitting mad, while others comment that this is great for new players who don't have the pocket money for a $400 make-believe dagger. Over at Forbes, Mike Stubbs speculates that this is actually Valve's way of punishing knife and glove dealers for selling the items on external marketplaces, even at the cost of sabotaging the CS player cosmetics biz (from which Valve takes a cut) in the short term. I'll go ask the developers if they'd like to comment on all this.

18,2025-10-23,"You can now order replacement parts for Pixel Buds directly from Google, with prices starting at $55 per component.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Enjoy our content? Make sure to set Android Central as a preferred source in Google Search, and find out why you should so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.
If you've ever lost a Pixel Bud or noticed one earbud or the charging case acting up, you know how tedious it can be to get a replacement. Google is finally making that process easier by selling replacement earbuds, eartips, and charging cases for the Pixel Buds directly through its online store.
As spotted by 9to5Google, the Google Store now lists replacement parts for the Pixel Buds Pro 2 and Pixel Buds 2a. That means if you misplace one earbud, drop it in water, or your case starts malfunctioning, you can now buy those specific parts directly from Google without having to go through support.
Previously, users had to go through a lengthy self-service repair process on Google's website to order replacement parts, which often took days and involved multiple steps. Now, you can simply go to the online store, choose the part you need, and buy it straight away.
For the Pixel Buds Pro 2, replacement earbuds cost $70, while the charging case costs $95. They're available in Porcelain, Hazel, Wintergreen, and Peony, though the new Moonstone color is currently unavailable. For the Pixel Buds 2a, both the earbuds and case cost $55 each, while replacement eartips for both earbuds are priced at $20.
 



Google notes that replacements may not always be available in all regions or at all times. At the time of writing, eartips for the Pixel Buds 2a are already out of stock. It's worth noting that at the time of purchasing, you can also specify whether you want the left or right earbud replaced.
This move aligns with Google's growing emphasis on repairability and sustainability across its product lineup. The company recently highlighted that the Pixel 10 series and Pixel Watch 4 are easier to repair than ever before and even hosted a repair education session at its New York store last week to promote the effort.
With the Pixel Buds 2a, Google has also made it possible to replace the charging case battery, something that wasn't possible with the previous generation Pixel Buds. And now, replacement parts are available for the rest of the earbuds too — though you might want to wait for Black Friday, where a full pair of Pixel Buds might cost nearly the same as these replacement parts.

I'm closing my eyes and letting AI take the wheel. That's the proposed future for GM, where executives are touting a new ""eyes-off"" self-driving feature launching in 2028. Nothing like a little cat nap when you're hitting 80 mph on the highway.
In today's big story, a portion of Corporate America is proud to tell you how it's avoiding AI. But executives' deep buy-in of the tech might make its arrival inevitable.
What's on deck:
Markets: Steve Cohen's Point72 shook up its top quant unit. Here's how it all went down.
Tech: The great flattening just came for Google's ad division.
Business: If you haven't secured a ""KPop Demon Hunter"" Halloween costume yet, you might be out of luck. (Please don't tell my three-year-old.)
But first, all in on not going all-in.
If this was forwarded to you, sign up here.
A human wrote the sentence you are currently reading. Is that a good enough reason for you to stick around?
That's the strategy behind some big-name corporate brands. While a good chunk of businesses tout their use of AI, another cohort is proudly declaring they're against it.
(Side note: If you'd actually prefer a robot wrote this newsletter, please don't share that opinion with my bosses.)
Aerie, Heineken, and DC Comics are some of the brands shouting from the rooftops (or massive billboards) about their anti-AI stance, writes BI's Lara O'Reilly and Jordan Hart.
For these companies, it's a bet that promoting human authenticity will resonate with people who are growing tired of AI infiltrating all aspects of life.
Finding that human-AI balance was a key theme at Advertising Week New York, Lara previously reported. And even those on the cutting edge of AI seem to recognize the need to tap into the human element.
Just look at this ad from OpenAI of a guy trying to do pull-ups. How very relatable and human!
Of course, there's no guarantee people are buying it.
""Would you like me to go ahead and do the workout for you?"" reads one of the top comments on YouTube.
The anti-AI companies are toeing a fine line.
While most people have some level of AI fatigue — I'm sick of getting tricked by those fake, AI-generated post-game press conferences — it also seems foolish to disregard the technology altogether.
The benefits of leveraging AI to some degree are undeniable, and dismissing that could be a grave mistake. Some might argue that a purely human approach in a world full of AI is a differentiator, like a restaurant sourcing all its ingredients from a local farm.
But while that business model might work on a small scale, the bigger you are the harder it becomes. That's especially true if your rivals are willing to dive into the AI pool headfirst.
Marketers could also be doing a bit of self-preservation. The more you proclaim the importance of marketing your company as human-first, the more job security you give yourself.
However, one study hints at the inevitability of AI adoption. The survey found 87% of executives use AI on the job, writes BI's Sarah E. Needleman. That's compared to just 57% usage among managers and 27% of employees using it.
The split shows how those at the top of orgs are the biggest proponents of the tech. But that doesn't make the adoption any easier, as Sarah covered in the deep divide taking place at video-game giant Electronic Arts.
1. Behind the shocking shakeup at Steve Cohen's top quant unit. The surprising ouster of Cubist president Denis Dancanet followed months of quiet maneuvering by Cohen and his top leader, people familiar with the matter said. Cubist is the roughly $7 billion quant division of Cohen's hedge fund Point72. Here's how it all unfolded.
2. Beyond Meat's meme-stock craze might be starting to spoil. Shares in the buzzy plant-based meat company finished down 1% on Wednesday and fell a further 20% in early trading on Thursday. Two options trading data points — and even the retail trader driving Beyond Meat's rally — suggest investors should be cautious.
3. Why gold's record-breaking rally has stalled out. After repeatedly hitting all-time highs over the course of a month, the precious metal has recently retreated. Market experts say gold's decline is likely driven by technical factors.
1. Google is stripping back management layers (again). In a memo sent to staff last month, the search giant said it was eliminating a middle-management layer in its US ads business. The move is part of Google's larger efforts to speed up decisions and cut bureaucracy, and it reflects a wider trend happening across Big Tech.
2. Meta's AI layoffs, in its own words. Chief AI officer Alexandr Wang said the cuts, which affect 600 Superintelligence Labs employees, will help the company make decisions more quickly. Read the full memo.
3. Amazon is taking the L in AI, but can it bounce back? Bernstein's Mark Shmulik — a top Wall Street tech analyst — said in a note that while AWS might be last in the AI race, it's not dead yet. Shmulik said AWS is showing early signs of progress, and its partnership with Anthropic is promising.
1. Tesla's record quarterly revenue wasn't enough for Wall Street. The EV giant's profit came in below analyst expectations, causing the stock to decline in after-hours trading. Elon Musk also railed against the major proxy firms opposing his proposed pay package, calling them ""corporate terrorists.""
2. Good luck finding a ""KPop Demon Hunters"" Halloween costume. Looks like Netflix really underestimated demand: The officially licensed costumes by Spirit Halloween are sold out online and in most stores. However, unlicensed dupes abound on sites like Etsy and Amazon.
3. It may be the toughest season ever for 'Shark Tank' contestants. Why? Because Tariffs are screwing up the show's usual playbook, BI's Katherine Li writes. For businesses that rely on global supply chains, the cost of production and projected profits may have collapsed between their on-camera pitch and the time their episode airs.

There's not much new in the 5-year plan, which is not unexpected.  Manufacturing dominance and technology self-reliance are the key priorities, but they already have been the key priorities in the last few years.
Perhaps the curious thing is that a lesser priority of increasing domestic consumption necessarily means increasing global exports.  While a large trade surplus brings many economic advantages, it is itself a roadblock to self-reliance.  If a full-blown trade war broke out between China and the G7/friends, China would be forced to overload poorer countries with its exports, which is not sustainable.  In a sense, having China hooked on exports should be a greater concern to China than not being able to procure GPUs.  The problem for China is that a huge trade surplus is a drug that would bring huge withdrawal symptoms if the drug were not available.

22,2025-10-23,"A new report from Counterpoint Research shows Apple outpacing the overall PC market in sales growth during the third quarter. Here are the details.
In the report, Counterpoint Research says global PC shipments rose 8.1% in Q3 2025 compared to the same period last year, “driven by approaching Windows 10 sunset, and strategic inventory adjustments related to certain US import tariff policies.”
From the press release:
“With nearly 40% of the current PC installed base still on Windows 10, this replacement cycle is poised to be a major catalyst for PC market growth over the next few years.”
For Apple, Counterpoint reported a 14.9% increase in shipments during the quarter, “thanks to popular new MacBook models and enterprise adoption.”
Apple ranked second behind Lenovo, which saw a 17% increase, and slightly ahead of Asus at 14%. Dell was the only major brand to record a decline, down 1%, while the “Others” category fell 3%.
Here’s what Counterpoint’s Senior Analyst Minsoo Kang had to say about the report:
“While the current growth is primarily driven by OS migration, the industry is poised for an even more profound transformation with the rise of the AI PC. However, this next wave of growth has not yet fully materialized in the Q3 2025 numbers.”
Looking ahead, Counterpoint says that AI PCs are expected to drive growth starting next year, “following the launch of new AI chipsets by key manufacturers.”

Create, personalize, and optimize your marketing emails without waiting on designers or IT.
Email marketing platforms address specific challenges law firms face in maintaining client relationships and generating new business:
Time Efficiency Through Automation – Lawyers maintain billable hour requirements while automated email sequences nurture leads, update clients on case progress, and maintain relationships with referral sources without manual effort for each communication.
Cost-Effective Lead Generation – Email marketing generates one of the highest ROIs in digital marketing at $36 return for every $1 spent, making it more economical than paid advertising while delivering targeted messages to qualified prospects interested in specific legal services.
Compliance and Professionalism – Purpose-built email marketing platforms help lawyers maintain ethical compliance by managing opt-in consent, providing clear unsubscribe options, and maintaining professional communication standards required by bar associations.
Client Relationship Management – Integrated CRM features track every client interaction, ensuring lawyers stay informed about client needs, follow up consistently, and provide attentive service that generates referrals and positive reviews.
Measurable Marketing Performance – Detailed analytics reveal which practice areas generate the most interest, which messages resonate with potential clients, and which campaigns drive consultation bookings, enabling data-driven marketing decisions.
When selecting email marketing software, lawyers should prioritize features that address the unique needs of legal services marketing:
Follow this systematic approach to select email marketing software that fits your law firm's specific needs:
Document how your firm currently communicates with leads, clients, and referral sources. Identify repetitive communications that could be automated, such as consultation confirmations, new client onboarding emails, case status updates, or referral partner newsletters.
Determine which features are essential versus nice-to-have based on your practice. Solo practitioners may prioritize ease of use and affordability, while larger firms might require multi-user access, advanced segmentation, and CRM integration with existing practice management software.
Test platforms during free trials to evaluate interface intuitiveness, template quality, and whether your team can use the software effectively without extensive training. Consider how much time team members can realistically dedicate to email marketing beyond billable work.
Review pricing tiers carefully, as costs increase significantly with contact list growth. Calculate total cost including contact limits, monthly email sends, and additional fees for features like SMS marketing or inbox preview testing.
Select software that grows with your firm and integrates with other tools you use. Legartis reduced cost per lead by 75% and increased the number of marketing qualified leads by 20X using HubSpot's integrated platform, demonstrating how comprehensive solutions deliver superior results as firms scale their marketing efforts.
Effective email marketing campaigns for lawyers follow a structured approach that builds trust while demonstrating legal expertise.
Establish specific objectives for each email campaign, whether generating consultation bookings, educating potential clients about specific legal matters, maintaining relationships with past clients who might refer new business, or staying top-of-mind with referral sources.
Collect email addresses through website forms, consultation requests, networking events, and existing client relationships. Ensure clear opt-in consent and provide transparent information about email frequency and content to maintain compliance with CAN-SPAM, GDPR, and bar association rules.
Divide contacts into meaningful groups based on practice area interest, current client status, referral source type, or engagement level. Send targeted content that addresses specific legal needs rather than generic messages to your entire database.
Develop emails that provide genuine value through legal insights, answers to common questions, case study succaries, or practical guidance. Avoid legal jargon that confuses non-lawyers and focus on clear explanations that demonstrate expertise while remaining accessible.
Use responsive email templates that maintain professional appearance across desktop and mobile devices. Include your firm's branding, clear calls-to-action, and proper legal disclaimers about attorney-client relationships.
Conduct A/B tests on subject lines, sending times, and content approaches to identify what resonates with your audience. Monitor metrics like open rates, click-through rates, and consultation bookings to continuously improve campaign performance.
Establish regular sending schedules that keep your firm top-of-mind without overwhelming recipients. Most law firms find success with monthly newsletters supplemented by targeted campaigns for specific practice areas or timely legal developments.
HubSpot stands out as the best email marketing tool for lawyers because it integrates CRM, email marketing, and automation in a single platform. Campmany Abogados increased its visitor-to-lead conversion rate from below 1% to 4% and boosted client numbers by 7X using HubSpot. For budget-conscious solo practitioners, Mailchimp offers excellent value with practice management software integrations, while ActiveCampaign provides sophisticated automation for firms with complex nurturing needs.
Prioritize practice management software integration, advanced segmentation by practice area and case type, compliance features for managing consent and privacy, automation for client onboarding and case updates, mobile optimization for clients checking email on smartphones, high deliverability rates to ensure messages reach inboxes, and detailed analytics to track which campaigns generate consultations. CRM capabilities help track every client interaction for better relationship management.
Yes, HubSpot excels for legal practices of all sizes. A Houston-based law firm improved productivity by 25% and decreased non-billable time by 40% using HubSpot. The platform combines contact management, email marketing, automation, and analytics in one system, eliminating the need to switch between multiple tools. HubSpot's free CRM makes it accessible to solo practitioners, while paid tiers scale effectively as firms grow. The platform integrates with legal practice management software and provides workflows specifically designed for client intake, case management, and referral nurturing.
Email marketing software costs vary significantly based on features and contact list size. Free plans exist from HubSpot, Mailchimp, and Brevo for small contact lists with basic features. Entry-level paid plans start around $10-20/month for 500 contacts but increase substantially as lists grow. Mid-tier plans with automation typically range from $30-60/month, while enterprise solutions can exceed $100/month. Consider total cost including contact limits, monthly send volumes, and additional fees for features like SMS, inbox preview, or additional users. Most platforms offer free trials to test functionality before committing.
Lawyers must comply with multiple regulations when conducting email marketing. CAN-SPAM Act requires accurate sender information, clear opt-out mechanisms, and truthful subject lines. GDPR applies when emailing EU residents and requires explicit consent and easy data access. Bar association rules vary by jurisdiction but generally prohibit false or misleading communications, require legal disclaimers, and may restrict testimonials. Always include unsubscribe links, use professional language, avoid guaranteeing outcomes, and maintain clear records of consent. Email marketing platforms typically provide built-in compliance tools, but lawyers remain responsible for ethical advertising practices.
HubSpot provides the comprehensive platform law firms need to automate marketing, manage client relationships, and grow their practice efficiently.
Why Lawyers Choose HubSpot:
HubSpot empowers law firms to automate client communication while maintaining the personal touch that builds trust and generates referrals. The platform enables lawyers to focus on billable work while sophisticated automation nurtures leads, updates clients, and maintains relationships with referral sources.

Wall Street is digesting the surprising idea that Amazon Web Services has fallen behind in the AI cloud race. That might not be as bad as it sounds, though.
""Is AWS in last place in AI? It's hard to argue otherwise,"" Bernstein's Mark Shmulik, one of the Street's top tech analysts, wrote in a note to investors this week.
He cited a slew of data to support this concerning development, including AWS's slower revenue ""growth rate,"" limited GPU capacity, CEO commentary, and the fact many AI startups are building elsewhere now.
That last point may be a reference to a Business Insider scoop last week that revealed Amazon is concerned about how generative AI is fueling a ""fundamental"" shift in how startups spend money on cloud computing services.
Shmulik noted that Microsoft Azure is growing faster than AWS due to Microsoft's early AI cloud partnership with OpenAI. Google Cloud is outperforming, too, with a ""full-stack"" offering that includes in-house Gemini AI models, special AI chips called TPUs, and fewer capacity issues.
""AI comes around and completely changes the rules of the game: suddenly there's a whole new crop of AI startups, LLMs, AI neoclouds, and a very expensive race for power, data centers, and GPUs,"" Shmulik wrote. ""Maybe cloud is a perfect example of an Internet business where we can slot the 'Is AWS at risk from AI?'""
Amazon's stock has been the ""clear laggard"" this year compared with Microsoft and Google, he added, as investors grow increasingly concerned that the company is ""truly in last place in AI.""
When emerging technology catches up to an incumbent, it used to be a ""death sentence,"" Shmulik wrote, pointing to past examples such as MySpace and Netscape.
But being late to a tech trend isn't always fatal, and there are more recent examples where incumbent tech giants have maintained their leads and held off fast-rising rivals, he added.
Meta bounced back after TikTok's rise, and Google has recovered from the initial shock of ChatGPT, Shumlik wrote. If AWS can chart a similar comeback, it could shift the narrative ahead of its AWS re:Invent conference later this year, the analyst argued.
Indeed, there are early signs of progress, according to this top analyst.
AWS posted its second-best quarter ever for net new dollar growth in the second quarter, Shmulik noted. The company remains capacity constrained, but that is starting to ease. AWS's partnership with Anthropic appears strong, with meaningful revenue contributions expected soon, he added.
""How does AWS drop the 'AI laggard' label?"" Shmulik wrote. ""A good story starts with good numbers. We see upside to AWS numbers and narrative around Re:Invent.""
Developer engagement with AWS services has increased since the beginning of the year and gained more momentum over the summer. Shmulik anticipates stronger revenue growth for AWS in the third quarter, with expectations for continued gains in the fourth quarter.
Bernstein see AWS revenue growing 18% this year to $127 billion. The research firm forecasts 21% growth in 2026 and in 2027.
Shmulik highlighted AWS's partnership with Anthropic as a key growth catalyst. Amazon has invested at least $8 billion in the AI startup and teamed up with the company on a new AI supercomputer initiative, dubbed Project Rainier, which uses Amazon's custom AI chips.
""Google has been Anthropic's primary compute provider so far, especially for inferencing,"" the analyst wrote. ""Project Rainier coming online should change this dynamic.""
Bernstein estimates that Project Rainier could account for up to 2.6% of AWS revenue in 2026 and potentially more than 4% in 2027.
""While the long-term debate is likely to have several twists and turns, we take a favorable view of the cloud market leader figuring out AI in-time with multiple ways to win,"" Shmulik wrote in the note to investors.
Amazon's spokesperson didn't respond to a request for comment.

A Bitcoin wallet dating back to the cryptocurrency’s earliest days has just come to life after more than 14 years of inactivity. 
The address, believed to have mined around 4,000 BTC between April and June 2009, transferred 150 BTC this week — the first movement since June 2011.
The coins, worth just $67,724 when last active, are now valued at roughly $16 million. On-chain data shows the wallet initially consolidated its mined BTC into a single address in 2011 and had remained untouched since.
A Satoshi-era wallet that mined 4,000 BTC between April and June 2009 – just months after Bitcoin’s launch – and consolidated everything into one wallet in June 2011, has just transferred out 150 BTC after 14.3 years of dormancy.It was worth $67,724 back in 2011.Now that same…
Transfers from Satoshi-era wallets are extremely rare. Data from Glassnode suggests only a handful of pre-2011 wallets move funds each year. 
The coins from this period were mined when Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, was still active in online discussions, making such movements a magnet for speculation.
Historically, old-wallet awakenings trigger short-term jitters in the market. Traders often interpret these moves as early holders preparing to sell, sparking fears of large inflows to exchanges. 
However, in most past cases, the coins were not sold but simply moved to new addresses for security, inheritance, or consolidation purposes.
The move comes as Bitcoin trades around $110,000, consolidating after a steep drop from its recent all-time high above $126,000 earlier this month. 
The market is recovering from the largest liquidation event in crypto history, with $19 billion wiped out across leveraged positions.
Sentiment remains fragile. Any signal suggesting potential sell pressure — especially from long-dormant wallets — can amplify caution. 
Still, the 150 BTC transfer represents a negligible share of daily Bitcoin trading volume, which exceeds $20 billion, making the market impact mostly psychological.
There are several plausible reasons behind the move. The owner could be migrating coins to a modern, secure wallet, executing estate planning, or testing transaction functionality. 
Unless the funds are later traced to exchange-linked addresses, it is unlikely that the coins were sold.
Similar awakenings in 2021 and 2023 did not lead to sustained price drops. Those transactions were eventually linked to personal reorganization rather than liquidations.
The Bitcoin market has been volatile in recent weeks, shaped by macroeconomic tension and heightened sensitivity to on-chain data. 
With prices consolidating between $108,000 and $111,000, traders are looking for direction amid fears of further corrections.
In this environment, old-wallet movements act as symbolic reminders of Bitcoin’s early decentralization — and the immense fortunes still sitting dormant. 
For investors, unless these coins reach exchange wallets, such awakenings hold psychological weight, not market-moving power.
The 14-year-old wallet’s activity is a historic anomaly rather than a harbinger of major market shifts. It reflects Bitcoin’s longevity and the vast untapped wealth from its earliest mining era. 
For now, the market continues to watch closely — but the move appears more like digital housekeeping than a signal of imminent selling.

A recent survey of 2,000 U.S. adults found 44% of them would consider using an AI headshot, and this is reportedly playing out in real life as professionals increasingly opt for the controversial images for LinkedIn or a CV. 
There has been an explosion of AI headshot generators, including on Canva, as customers turn to them not just for a cheaper price, but in the hope it gives them an edge on competition.
But the price point is important; one young professional tells CNBC that when she studied at Yale, a 15-minute session with a headshot photographer set her back $200. 
“It was really expensive. The process of getting the pictures back, rendering them, looking at which ones I looked the best in, and then sending it back to the photographer for edit,” says Melanie Fan, who now works at an AI-powered shopping platform. 
Last year I tried out PhotoPacks.AI, a service that costs just $10 and for that the user receives hundreds of AI images. But as I pointed out then, while the images may look a little like me, it’s not exactly how I look. 
“It is perceived as risky to use an AI headshot,” Sam DeMase, a ZipRecruiter career expert, tells CNBC. “A poorly done AI-generated headshot is easily recognized, reads as inauthentic, and can hurt the candidate’s chances of being selected.”
However as technology advances, it is getting more and more difficult to definitively tell if an image is AI-generated. And with AI headshots, if you’ve never met the person whose photos you’re looking at, then you have no frame of reference on whether the image is a true representation of them. 
CNBC spoke to LinkedIn which says that it does allow AI headshots on the website but with the caveat, “the photo must reflect your likeness.” That feels like a very gray area. 
Canva insists that the purpose of its AI headshot generator is not to replace photographers, but to create a “more accessible way to get professional and unique headshots.” 
If you’re a headshot photographer who has been affected by the AI headshot market, we’d love to hear from you. Please get in touch via the tip line.

U.S. stocks lost ground Wednesday as investors processed disappointing earnings from Netflix (NFLX), amid ongoing trade tensions with China and a government shutdown that has paused key economic reporting. 
The large-cap S&P 500 index fell 0.5%, while the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite and the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average each retreated by 0.9%. 
After the market close, Tesla reported third-quarter EPS of $0.50. Analysts had expected $0.54. The EV maker did beat revenue expectations ahead of the expiration of federal EV tax credits at year-end. 
Tesla stock declined 3.5% in after-hours trading. TSLA stock is up 8.7% for the year—which is well behind its Magnificent 7 peers. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) is up 17.5% this year. 
Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), and Meta Platforms (META) report earnings on Oct. 29. Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) are set to report on Oct. 30. Investors will wait until Nov. 19 to hear Nvidia’s third-quarter results.
Stock futures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones are down of the market open on Thursday. Contracts tied to the S&P 500 dipped less than 0.1% and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.1%. Dow Jones futures also retreated 0.1%. 
How often does the stock market crash? The accepted definition of a stock market crash is a 20% or larger decline in a major market index, like the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average. A smaller decline, on the order of 10% to 20%, is usually called a correction. Downturns below 10% are known as pullbacks or selloffs. 
Assuming a crash means a 20% or larger reduction in the S&P 500, there have been 13 crashes since 1950, according to IG Wealth Management. Simple math translates 13 crashes over 75 years to one crash every 5.8 years. Another analysis by First Trust Portfolios L.P. identifies 14 crashes since 1942, which yields nearly the same number. 
The last stock market crash was in 2022. For that calendar year, the S&P 500 was down 18.1%—but the index fell more than 20% between December, 2021 and September, 2022. 
Importantly, since the bottom of the 2022 crash, the S&P 500 has gained nearly 88%.
Stock market crashes happen. If you are investing for retirement or some other long-term goal, you will occasionally see the value of your stocks fall by more than 20%. But if you have a high-quality, diversified portfolio, it will recover and return to growth. 
Two strategies can minimize the damage. One, stay invested to avoid taking unnecessary losses. And two, buy more shares of good companies when prices are down. This way, you make more on the other side. "

Rivian doesn't have a footprint in China's highly competitive EV market, where companies like BYD and Xiaomi reign supreme.
That doesn't mean the California-based EV maker isn't paying close attention to the world abroad.
In an interview with Business Insider, Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said the company tore down a Xiaomi SU7, a highly popular EV sedan in China, as part of an industry-standard practice of benchmarking other vehicles in the market.
The SU7 is the Chinese smartphone juggernaut's success story. It was launched in early 2024 with a starting price tag of $30,000 and helped Xiaomi blow past its annual delivery expectations by November of the same year.
The car was praised by Ford CEO Jim Farley. Business Insider previously wrote that the SU7 delivered on performance. After Rivian took a look, Scaringe agrees.
""I'd say it's a really well executed, heavily vertically-integrated technology platform,"" Scaringe said, referring to how the company develops the car's tech stack in-house. ""Nicely done.""
The CEO said the SU7 would be one of the cars he'd consider buying if he were living in China — that is, of course, since Rivian's not there.
However, Scaringe said there's no secret sauce inside the car that makes the SU7 cheap and a runaway success in the country.
""Cost — we understood how they've arrived there,"" Scaringe said, adding that ""there's nothing we learned from the teardown.""
The CEO points to macroeconomic factors like the low cost of labor and the Chinese government's support for EVs.
""The cost of capital is zero or negative, meaning they get paid to put up plants,"" Scaringe said of Chinese companies. ""It's a very different opportunity.""
Scaringe added that, while the US has provided loans, the idea of a production plant being supported through a government grant is ""just not something that exists in the US.""
The Department of Energy announced in January a $6.6 billion loan to support Rivian's new manufacturing plant in Georgia.
A mix of looser regulatory hurdles, lower labor costs, and more government subsidies allow China to churn out more affordable electric cars, Travis Fisher, director of energy and environmental policy studies at the Cato Institute, previously told Business Insider.
""When you take the cost of capital down to zero or less than zero and you have a cost of labor that's very low — you can do the math, you can build a spreadsheet that can arrive at exactly how they're doing it,"" Scaringe said.
It's a factor that the Rivian CEO said he wished more people talked about to de-mystify why China's rate of electrification surpasses that of the US.
""I think it's like Wizard of Oz,"" he said. ""I think when people think there's a Wizard of Oz, it's not helpful. It's like there is no magic in the world. Everything could be analyzed and calculated.""

30,2025-10-23,"Apple engaged in anticompetitive behavior by charging App Store developers ""excessive and unfair prices"" for app distribution services, the UK's Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) ruled today [PDF] (via Reuters).
The Tribunal found that Apple abused its market power by overcharging developers from October 2015 through the end of 2020. Developers were forced into using Apple's in-app purchase system and had no alternative to paying up to a 30 percent commission during that time period. The excessive fees ultimately led to higher prices for consumers.
According to the CAT, Apple had a monopoly over iOS app distribution and in-app payments. Apple's argument that Android and other platforms were viable alternatives for consumers and developers was rejected. The Tribunal also did not accept Apple's argument that its rules and fees were required for user security and privacy.
The end of 2020 in the UK's timeline corresponds with the launch of the App Store Small Business Program that saw Apple reduce ‌App Store‌ fees for independent developers and small business owners. The program reduced the commission that Apple collected from developers earning under $1 million per year to 15 percent, down from 30 percent. It's also when Apple began implementing other ‌App Store‌ changes in response to cases like Epic Games v. Apple.
The class action lawsuit was first filed in 2021 by Kings College London academic Dr. Rachael Kent, and the claim seeks up to £1.5 billion in damages. The period between 2015 and 2020 was selected in order to determine how much Apple will need to pay to UK consumers.
A damages trial is scheduled for November. Apple said it will appeal the ruling.

To many inside Cubist Systematic Strategies — the roughly $7 billion quant division of Steve Cohen's hedge fund Point72 Asset Management — the ouster of president Denis Dancanet last month came as a shock.
When Cohen's September 10 memo announcing the change landed, Dancanet had already begun preparing for year-end performance reviews, and scheduled meetings that day — including with job candidates — were abruptly canceled, according to people familiar with the matter.
""People close to Denis were surprised,"" one of the people said. ""Standard business was occurring.""
His big-name replacement, former WorldQuant Chief Investment Officer Geoffrey Lauprete, added to the curiosity. Lauprete had spent much of the past year laying the groundwork for an ambitious hedge fund launch of his own.
Uncertainty loomed in the aftermath, with rumors of cuts and executive resignations swirling. The dust has started to clear in the six weeks since. In town halls and smaller meetings, Point72 leadership reaffirmed its commitment to its roster of 60 independent trading teams and the centralized investing unit that Dancanet built starting in 2020.
""There are no plans to cut [portfolio managers] or investment teams — we remain focused on attracting great talent and growing Cubist,"" a Point72 spokesperson said in a statement to Business Insider. They declined to comment on Cubist's leadership changes. Dancanet also declined to comment.
This week, Issam Bazzi, a key leader on the central team whose future has been the fixation of market chatter for weeks, signed a long-term contract extension after discussions with Cohen, Business Insider has learned.
But what led to the surprising change at the top has remained murky. Cubist's performance had been strong during Dancanet's five-year run, and it remained positive in 2025 even after a short stint of summer losses that plagued the whole industry.
If the shake-up felt sudden to some, that was by design. The announcement capped months of quiet maneuvering by Cohen and his top deputies, who'd started to question whether Dancanet was the right person to lead Cubist, people with knowledge of the matter said. Point72 started a hush-hush search in early summer, auditioning candidates in a closely guarded process to avoid leaks and disruptions to the business, one person with direct knowledge of the matter said.
The result wasn't a fait accompli. A series of converging events and chance timing culminated in one of the industry's most unanticipated leadership swaps.
This story is based on conversations with more than a dozen people close to Cubist and Libero Capital, including current and former employees, allocators, and service providers. They requested anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak on behalf of their companies or to protect client relationships.
Fundamental stock picking is at the core of Cohen's Point72. But he's been involved in systematic trading for nearly as long as he's been running funds, hiring his first quant portfolio manager in 1994.
After longtime Cubist head Ross Garon decamped for Izzy Englander's Millennium in 2020, Cohen brought in Dancanet, a veteran of the collaborative quant fund PDT — in large part to help realize a long-held desire to diversify from independent teams, or the so-called pod structure, and build a centralized systematic trading team in the mold of traditional powerhouse quant shops like PDT, Renaissance Technologies, or Two Sigma.
""The difference compared to the pod model is that it's much more collaborative and there's open communication between the various teams across strategies,"" Dancanet explained in a 2023 blog post, which has since been scrubbed from the Point72 website. ""The goal is to create a hybrid business structure combining the PM platform and the central team, which we feel would be unique for our industry.""
Dancanet was a cerebral, serene, and well-liked leader, according to those who've worked with him. He started on Wall Street in the mid-1990s after defecting from communist Romania in 1985.
He joined Cubist after a four-year hiatus from quant trading, working on startups — one focused on flying cars and the other on applying data science to consumer lending.
Dancanet immediately got to work building a centralized trading unit from scratch, an endeavor that, like any quant investment platform, would be expensive and take years to realize. Dancanet lured marquee hires, including former colleague Bazzi, from places like Citadel, Jump Trading, Squarepoint, and Tower Research.
The road didn't lack bumps — the head of Cubist's high-frequency trading effort left after less than a year on the job — but the central group began trading and making money after a couple of years. It reached 100 people in 2025 and through mid-year had strong performance, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.
The other key part of Dancanet's job was something he lacked experience in: hiring PMs to run the independent pods Cubist is known for. Unlike hiring discretionary stock pickers, who can be up and running in days or weeks, bets on systematic PMs can take years to bear fruit as they assemble the necessary data and infrastructure, research and backtest strategies, and execute trading models.
While returns at Cubist, which has doubled head count over the past three years, remained robust in the years after Dancanet joined, a pain point emerged with Cohen: Many of the PMs Dancanet brought in weren't moving the needle, according to people familiar with the matter.
Cubist money managers who predated Dancanet generated a disproportionate amount of the returns, according to people familiar. Whether his leadership contributed to or improved the legacy PMs' performance is unclear, but Cohen wanted to see improvement on the disparity.
While many PMs dislike micromanaging executives, Dancanet's more laissez-faire leadership style may have given Cohen and top deputies pause, insiders said.
Dancanet's contract was up for renewal before the end of the year, and Cohen's team started to quietly explore alternatives.
For Point72, Lauprete was a uniquely attractive candidate. At WorldQuant, he oversaw a massive centralized investment process, though the fund also has independent pods.
Moreover, Lauprete, who left WorldQuant after 17 years in early 2024, wasn't bound by one of the lengthy noncompete clauses that often sideline quants for years, meaning he could start immediately — minimizing disruption at Cubist. The catch: He had spent considerable time and money preparing the launch of his own fund, Libero Capital.
Lauprete initially secured Paloma Partners, the storied hedge fund founded by Donald Sussman in the 1980s, as an anchor investor. The relationship soured, and by April, according to Hedge Fund Alert, Lauprete and Paloma parted ways.
Lauprete continued pitching investors through the spring and summer, drawing interest from firms including Engineers Gate, BlackRock, and Blackstone, people familiar said. (Representatives for those firms declined to comment.)
He also held an initial meeting with Cubist, including Dancanet, in early summer about having Libero manage a slug of capital. But unbeknownst to Dancanet, discussions continued separately with Point72 leaders and evolved in scope.
In early summer, Cubist — like most quant funds — was having a strong year. Systematic long-short funds were up double digits heading into June, according to a Goldman Sachs research report. The central team was profitable, and Dancanet aimed to eventually dedicate half of Cubist's capital to it, people familiar with his plan said.
But then the steady, mysterious losses across the quantitative trading industry started to pile up, turning into a two-month bloodbath. Cubist experienced a severe drawdown, suffering its worst stretch since the COVID pandemic in early 2020, but recovered some of those losses, and year-to-date performance remained positive.
Unlike setups at some rivals, Cubist isn't a stand-alone fund investors can allocate to with separately reported returns; its performance flows into Point72's overall returns. Point72 recorded gains in July and August and is up 9.7% through September.
Point72's under-the-radar search for a potential Cubist successor continued.
But while Libero was generating intrigue, capital commitments sufficient for its ambition weren't materializing, sources with knowledge of the matter said. Some investors were wary of the scale and associated costs of a large-scale quant launch as well as the autonomy Lauprete wanted, the people said.
Lauprete, who was funding Libero out of his own pocket, was simultaneously interviewing with Point72 executives about the Cubist job, a process kept closely guarded to avoid leaks, one insider said.
Dancanet and Cohen discussed contract extensions over the summer without coming to a conclusion. Then, over the first weekend in September, Lauprete and Cohen agreed to terms that would install Lauprete as Cubist president and move Libero under the unit's umbrella, people close to the firm said. Days later, Cohen sent out the memo announcing the leadership change.
Cohen convened a short-notice virtual meeting with Cubist PMs the next day, one company insider said, reassuring them that he remained committed to both sides — the pods and the central team — of his hybrid vision for Cubist.
Some industry insiders called it an opportunistic fit for both sides: a more seasoned leader for Cubist, and for Lauprete, a chance to land one of Wall Street's most coveted quant jobs while keeping Libero alive, which will join Cubist as an independent pod, people familiar said. He started the role at the beginning of October.
The months and years ahead will reveal whether Cohen's leadership shake-up pays off — and whether Lauprete can deliver on the challenge of fusing Cubist's independent pods and central team ambitions into a single machine that churns out industry-beating returns.

32,2025-10-23,"It’s the moment you hard-core hardware nerds have been waiting for: the reveal of the 2025 Hackaday Supercon Communicator Badge. And this year, we’ve outdone ourselves, but that’s thanks to help from stellar collaboration with folks from the community, and help from sponsors. This badge is bigger than the sum of its parts, and we’ve planned for it to be useful for you to hack on in the afterlife. Indeed, as always, you are going to be the final collaborator, so we can’t wait to see what you’ll do with it.
We’re going out – wide out – on a limb and trying to create a dense mesh network of badges talking to each other at Supercon. It’s going to be like a badge-hosted collection of chat rooms, as connected as we can make them without talking over each other.
You look up a topic, say Retro Computing or SAO trading, punch in the channel number on the numpad, and your badge starts listening to everything going on around that topic. But they also listen to everything else, and repeat anything they hear on to their neighbors. Like IRC, but LoRa.

But let’s talk hardware. The first thing that hits you is the custom keyboard, a hat-tip to portable computing devices of yore, but actually infinitely more capable and even nicer under the thumbs. Behind the keyboard is a custom dome-switch sticker sheet and a TC8418 I2C keyboard matrix multiplexer chip, which does away with all of the diodes and decoding and makes a keyboard design easy.
In the driver’s seat is an ESP32-S3, courtesy of Espressif, no less. We asked, and they made it rain: it’s the good one with 8 MB of PSRAM and 16 MB of flash – plenty of room for about anything, and just enough pins to run the show. We needed the form-factor of the LCD screen for the aesthetics, and we’ll just say there’s not much choice in this shape; we had to go for an LCD with a strange newish driver chip, but we made it work with the help of sketchy Arduino init scripts found around the interwebs.
Did we mention LoRa? A Communicator Badge is no good without a means of communication. Seeed makes these nice little SX1262 LoRa modules, and they were our first choice not only because they’re cute, but also because they come with a bring-your-own antenna option, and they had enough of them in stock. (This is not to be underestimated these days!) SMA adapter, LiPo and charging circuitry, and badge is your uncle! Super thanks go out to DigiKey for sponsoring us all manner of needed components.
 

Here is where we run into our first problem, and it’s the exact opposite of the problem that mesh networks are designed to solve. Those little LoRa radios transmit easily 1 km to 2 km in open space, maybe half that in an urban neighborhood. And we’re putting 500 hundred of them in the alley, with often just a couple meters between badges.
Somehow we missed [Bob Hickman]’s talk on SAOs with cheap components. So here is a special shout-out.The game here, in this Bizarro world, is trying to figure out how little power each badge can use while still holding the mesh network somewhat together. It’s an experiment, it’s uncharted territory, and we’d bet that if they had a world record for the most long-range radios within the shortest range of each other, we’d win!
Still, we’ve got some tricks up our sleeve, we’ve got a lot of bandwidth at our discretion, and we’ve got a smart bunch of hackers. We can make this work, and we will have some odd corners of radio spectrum for you to play around with too. Get together with a couple friends and have fun with RF.
We’ll also be broadcasting Supercon-relevant news out to the badges from time to time. Things like which talks are coming up, when and where the food has arrived, and so on.
Back to the keyboard. Hackaday superfriend [Arturo182] was one of the first few people to make the new-old-stock Blackberry keyboards usable for the masses, building on the work of [JoeN] and [WooDWorkeR]. But hacker demand has dried up the global stock of the old gems, and [Arturo] turned to making his own keyboards. We saw his prototypes and had to get in on the action.
Other badges have come out using his stock keyboard, but only Hackaday and Supplyframe’s Design Lab was foolish enough to do something totally custom. Actually, it was super easy with [Arturo] leading the keyboard project, because he knows all about the details of preparing the designs for the keyboard dome sheets, and worked with the Design Lab team and Supplyframe’s designer [Bogdan Rosu] to get the custom silicone covers looking pretty. Thanks [Arturo]!
The software is still under wraps. The folks at Design Lab are turning out badges as fast as they can, even as we write this, and that means that we’re still working on the software. The last minute is the sweetest minute. Again, though, we’re not alone.
The brains behind the software effort is [Spaceben], and I have to say I haven’t seen such clean Python code in my life. Everything is possible when you have good folks on your team.
We’re using the LVGL graphics framework for Micropython, which makes the GUI design a lot snazzier than it would otherwise be. It was also easy enough to port our funny display driver to lvgl_micropython, and we’re working on the keyboard too. We’ll see what works on Supercon Day 1!

And that brings us to you! Mesh-network-IRC is fun during the conference, but after the fact, these badges are going to be too good to just leave on the shelf. Porting Meshtastic to the badge would be a fantastic project. The keyboard, WiFi, and Bluetooth connectivity just beg for some kind of handheld remote-control device design. The panel for a home automation setup? Or heck, go super simple and just wire the I2C keyboard out to your next project that needs one. We’d bet a Jolly Wrencher sticker that the badge could be quickly transformed into an ELRS radio control unit.
We love the badge scene, and like many of you out there, we find it’s a pity when the badges just sit in the closet. So we tried to plan for the afterlife here by making the badge hardware as useful as we could, and by making the software side as accessible as possible. Those of you who hack on the badge during Supercon, you’ll be blazing the trails for the rest of us afterwards.
We hope you find it fun to chat with others at Supercon, a fun platform to work on, and something useful after the fact. Managing an ad-hoc chaos mesh network isn’t going to be easy, but the real goal is the friends you meet along the way. See you all at Supercon!
Very special thanks to the amazing DesignLab engineering interns — Kris, Jocelyn, and Chris S. — and to the Hackaday community volunteers who are helping us right now put the badges together, troubleshoot, test, and more. Brandon, Dave, Will, Mike, Scoops, Chris, Rich, Voja, and many more — thank you!
Go go go!  Good luck y’all.  (And sorry I didn’t call you all out by name.)
Looks pretty cool!
Omg I need to go… I swear the communicator badge has nothing to do with it
The description sounds like the badge is not using Meshtastic or MeshCore as radio protocol, but something custom. What is the reasoning behind it? I mean, developing your own mesh protocol and making it actually work isn’t that easy, while these projects have working code, are tried and the ugliest quirks flushed out.
So why not use one of these, with some custom UI and custom message handling to implement the IRC-like functionality?
Totally good question!
Part of it is b/c Supercon is exactly the contention/congestion situation that gives Meshtastic the most trouble. Although they seem to have done pretty well at DEFCON this year, aside from the obvious problems of running a secure network at a security conference: https://meshtastic.org/blog/that-one-time-at-defcon/.  But at the time we were planning, it looked more like a liability.
Meshtastic has security/encryption.  We don’t need that.  Our goal is maximum sharing / community.  If you want to say something secret — you have other ways.
Meshtastic is in C, we wanted everything to be maximally natively hackable in Python.  We want you to write bots.  We didn’t want to port it over.
Meshtastic is alread a fantastic product, but it’s self-sufficient.  We wanted a toy for you all to play with.
We’re stoked if people use them that way afterwards, and we designed the hardware to be maximally compatible — down to looking at popular radio designs.  The keyboard is custom, but the rest was designed to be as smooth as possible.  Tom has been talking to Meshtastic devs, and they want to port the badge already.  We had to beg them to not start before Supercon.  :)
Dang. I want one.
I’d like to attend but cannot. Wish there was a similar or DIY version doing a bulk order :D
We will be making more for Europe.
The only regret is that the keyboard is hard to replicate. It’s the up-front costs.  But by the time Giovanni (design lab) had sketched it out, we had fallen in love with the graphic design.
That said, the experience was super enlightening.  The key-dome stickers are very cool, and you could do maybe a TPU key layer that would knock down the fixed costs.  Are there flexible resins for resin printers?
The keys have little “pins” on the underside, though, so they concentrate the force on the domes, which has a fantastic feel.  You would probably want to replicate that if possible.
There are definitely some UV set resins that are ‘flexible’ but I’m not sure there are any that would really survive this scenario, its quite a torture tests with constant handling by messy humans and rather targeted deformation in use. The easier option is probably to use the resin printer to print a few mold and just use regular silicone sealent gun to fill ’em up (probably using a faster setting 2 part silicone rather than the usual bathroom stuff so the mould can be cycled rather quicker).
wouldn’t mind this popping up for sale on tindie
 I have to say I haven’t seen such clean Python code in my life .. what’s wrong with good old fashioned dirty python code? Much under rated IMO.
Honestly, if “clean” was the goal, why wasn’t the whole thing written in Whitespace? (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_(programming_language) for those not familiar).
Can’t get “cleaner” than a total lack of pixels 🙂
This is awesome and I wish I could attend.
Seconded!
Reminds me of the Sharp PC (and other “pocket computers” of the 1980s).
Must be popular form factor, since it is being regularly reinvented.
Wow both keyboard and display look amazing! This is product quality, not a badge :o
Display is not mentioned on the schematic, but there is datasheet in https://github.com/Hack-a-Day/2025-Communicator_Badge/blob/main/documentation/datasheets/ER-TFT2.79-1_Datasheet.pdf ~$4 IPS 168x428x18-bit 2.79 inch (NV3007 controller) and its gorgeous.
It’s everything I want in a little pocket computer. The keyboard alone is something I’ve been looking for off and on for years. I hope you all have fun at the meetup. I also hope you guys sell that keyboard and or the whole kit (maybe with a form factor that allows for different microcontrollers). Seriously though… I want exactly that with a few other hackable spots.

Beyond the AI boom, some healthcare startups are at a crossroads: combine with a competitor, or close their doors.
Healthcare M&A activity has been slower in 2025 than many investors and founders would've hoped, two bankers and a private equity investor said during a panel Monday at the HLTH conference in Las Vegas.
But that pace appears to be picking up. Sasha Kelemen, a director in Baird's healthcare investment banking group, said during the panel that while digital health startups have historically been reluctant to merge with one another, she's beginning to see silver linings as companies ""recalibrate expectations.""
""You're seeing kind of a 'come to Jesus' moment where a lot of companies are realizing across digital health that if they are going to survive, they're going to have to come together in different ways,"" she said. '""But it's a painful process to do that.""
Founders across tech are running into the same dilemma: as AI overtakes investor and buyer attention, many non-AI startups that were hot in venture's 2021 funding boom are now struggling to raise capital. Merging with a rival has become their last resort and perhaps their only hope.
Nick Richitt, global cohead of healthcare services investment banking at JPMorgan, said he's seeing more early-stage VC-backed startups and investors come to the table to consider mergers in areas like virtual care. He hasn't seen the same willingness in previous quarters.
""Why are we pursuing parallel roadmaps when we could pool our resources?"" he said.
Some virtual care combinations are already happening, across both early-stage and late-stage players, albeit many in the form of acquisitions. And often, they're coming with valuation markdowns. Telehealth GLP-1 startup RemedyMeds bought consumer health provider Thirty Madison, last valued at $1 billion a $140 million Series C round in 2021, for $500 million in September. 
On Monday, public mobile health provider DocGo said it would buy virtual care startup SteadyMD in a deal worth up to $25 million; SteadyMD has raised nearly $40 million to date, including a $25 million round in 2021 led by Lux Capital.
While VC investment across healthcare slipped in the first half of 2025, health tech funding got a boost, thanks to AI. M&A activity is seeing a similar trend. The total value of healthcare M&A deals in the first half of the year rose 56% compared to the previous six months, despite deal volume seeing a 1% dip, due in part to higher-priced healthcare AI deals, according to KPMG.
Buyers' healthcare AI appetite is leaving many healthcare services players out to dry. That could force those startups to search for a lifeline among their adversaries.
There are two types of struggling healthcare companies right now, Richitt said.
First are the late-stage companies that raised large sums of capital in 2021 at lofty valuations. Many of those startups are taking longer than expected to grow into those valuations and shore up their economics as the standards for healthcare IPOs get higher, Richitt said.
Some of those startups are turning to M&A to manufacture the growth or extra runway they need, Robb Vorhoff, managing director and global head of healthcare at General Atlantic,
""Investors said, I really want to push the valuation to the max, minimize the dilution, and I assume I can always punch out. Then the tide goes out,"" he said. ""It has been a grind for those companies to work through, and in the digital health space, it's driven a lot of M&A activity.""
The second type of struggling healthcare company is the earlier-stage startup that's stuck in what Richitt called the ""doom loop.""
""You get to a point where the funding dries up, and your only options are venture debt and reining in cash flow, so maybe you don't grow as fast. Then your valuation comes down. You get stuck trying to outrun the debt,"" Richitt said.
But mergers of ""equals"" can be challenging, Kelemen said. Even if founders can find a complementary business that's also interested in merging — a feat difficult enough on its own — those founders might not agree on their startups' relative valuations, or who should be in charge of the combined company, she said.
At the same time, investors across VC and private equity are facing increasing pressure to return capital to their limited partners, Vorhoff said.
He added that the valuation corrections across healthcare, and the deals that may come with them, are healthy for the industry — even when they hurt.
Healthcare VC has become a tale of two cities as struggling startups stand alongside AI peers facing rising investor and buyer demand.
While Vorhoff noted there are fewer strategic buyers or private equity sponsors interested in virtual care bets right now, healthcare AI deals are surging, especially for companies selling AI into hospitals.
Hospital revenue management is the hottest ticket in town. R1 RCM bought General Catalyst-backed Phare Health last week for better medical coding capabilities. Public revenue cycle management company Waystar closed a deal for Iodine Software for $1.25 billion this month. Earlier this year, New Mountain Capital created its own revenue cycle management play by combining multiple companies, including startup SmarterDx, which it paid around $1 billion for.
""We're seeing a lot of the large incumbents think about, do we buy or build, especially in the AI space,"" Kelemen said.
Venture-backed startups want in on the action, too. AI scribe darling Abridge is reserving a portion of the $700 million it's raised from investors over the past year and a half to consider acquisitions as it digs into revenue cycle management, CEO Shiv Rao told Business Insider in August.
Richitt said investors and bankers are still figuring out how to structure those deals and evaluate risks in the market as AI startups land high valuations relative to their revenue.
""How do you value an AI company? We don't really know what the margin retention looks like, or what the endgame looks like for this company,"" Richitt said. ""Do the incumbents have the advantage, versus these startups with a clean slate? I don't know. The M&A market is going to adjudicate some of this, figure out the answers, and the IPO market will do the rest.""

Texas Instruments (TXN) stock has decreased by 5.6% over the last day and is presently priced at $170.71. Our machine-led multifactor analysis indicates that it may be wise to lessen exposure to TXN stock. 
Our primary concern lies with the current valuation, suggesting that a price of $136 could be achievable. We maintain that there are only a few aspects to be wary of in TXN stock due to its overall Strong operational performance and financial standing. However, with its Very High valuation, the stock seems Relatively Expensive.
There are some broader trends investors need to be mindful of as well, including ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties tied to the U.S.- China trade war, tariff issues, and sluggish recovery in sectors like industrials, which are creating headwinds for TXN. 
Below is our evaluation:
Recently, TXN stock has declined significantly, and we currently perceive it to be relatively costly. Although this might seem like an opportunity, there is considerable risk in depending on a single stock. Conversely, there is substantial advantage in pursuing a more diverse strategy. If you want potential returns with reduced volatility compared to holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio (HQ) – HQ has outperformed its benchmark – a mixture of S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap index, achieving returns exceeding 105% since its launch. Risk management is crucial – consider what the long-term portfolio performance could be if you mixed 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto with HQ’s performance metrics.
 
Let’s delve into the details of each of the evaluated factors, but prior to that, for quick background: With $155 Bil in market capitalization, Texas Instruments supplies semiconductors, including power management products and microcontrollers for electronic designers, operating in analog and embedded processing segments.
[1] Valuation Looks Very High
This table illustrates how TXN is valued compared to the broader market. For more details, see: TXN Valuation Ratios
[2] Growth Is Inconsistent
 
This table illustrates how TXN is growing in comparison to the broader market. For more details, see: TXN Revenue Comparison
[3] Profitability Appears Very Strong
 
This table showcases how TXN’s profitability compares to the broader market. For more details, see: TXN Operating Income Comparison 
[4] Financial Stability Looks Very Strong
 
[5] Downturn Resilience Is Moderate
TXN faced an impact slightly better than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. We evaluate this based on both (a) how much the stock declined and, (b) how quickly it bounced back.
2022 Inflation Shock 
 
2020 Covid Pandemic
 
2008 Global Financial Crisis
The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a selection of 30 stocks, has a history of consistently outperforming its benchmark which encompasses all three – S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded better returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; providing a smoother experience, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Rivian didn’t simply add another e-bike to the market. Through their new ALSO spinoff, they applied automotive-grade engineering to reimagine what two-wheeled transportation could become when stripped of mechanical constraints. The TM-B e-bike represents a fundamental shift in how we think about pedal-powered vehicles, replacing century-old drivetrain conventions with a software-defined riding experience.
Designer: Rivian
What emerges is a platform for modular micromobility that prioritizes adaptability over specialization. The design philosophy centers on one radical premise: remove the mechanical connection between pedaling and propulsion, then rebuild the entire vehicle around what becomes possible.
Traditional bicycle design bows to the demands of mechanical drivetrains. Chains dictate frame geometry. Derailleurs determine clearances. Gear ratios constrain wheel sizing. The TM-B dismisses these limitations entirely.






The pedal-by-wire system, which Rivian calls DreamRide, severs the physical link between your legs and the wheels. When you pedal, you’re powering a generator. That energy charges the battery, which then drives a motor at the rear wheel. The implications for design freedom are profound.
Frame tubes can be sized for structural efficiency rather than mechanical routing. Standover height becomes a pure ergonomic decision. Wheel placement optimizes handling instead of accommodating chain length. The entire architecture flows from rider needs rather than mechanical requirements.
Full suspension with 120mm travel front and rear creates spatial generosity in how the bike absorbs terrain. Those gold-anodized stanchions aren’t just premium visual cues, they signal a riding experience tuned for urban chaos and trail exploration equally.
The top frame isn’t fixed structure but rather a design canvas that transforms the vehicle’s purpose in seconds. This modularity enables three distinct configurations without tools or complex adjustment procedures.

Swap in a solo seat configuration, and the TM-B becomes a personal urban runner with dual water bottle mounts. The proportions read athletic, lean, focused. Slide in the bench seat instead, and suddenly spatial relationships shift. The bike lengthens visually. Room for a passenger or substantial cargo alters how you perceive the vehicle’s stance and capability.
Mount the utility cargo rack, and form follows function most overtly. That 77-pound capacity reshapes what this platform enables: grocery runs, equipment transport, daily errands that traditionally demanded four wheels. The transformations require no tools. Seconds to swap. The design intelligence lies in creating attachment points that disappear when not in use while providing industrial-grade strength when loaded.
Each configuration tells a different spatial story while maintaining design coherence. The frame proportions accommodate all three personalities without compromise.
Eliminating the mechanical drivetrain removes visual and tactile complexity from the entire right side of the bike. This creates unprecedented surface cleanliness that most e-bikes can’t achieve because they still rely on traditional bicycle components.






No derailleur hanging vulnerably from the dropout. No cassette stack creating width at the rear wheel. No chain requiring guards, maintenance, or lubricant. The Gates carbon belt drive (on the pedal input side) delivers power silently and permanently to the generator, not to the wheel directly. It’s designed to outlast the bike itself with zero maintenance intervals.
This material reduction extends to the cockpit. Traditional bikes clutter the handlebars with shifter pods, brake levers, and sometimes throttle controls. The TM-B consolidates everything through a central touchscreen that floats between the grips. Gear selection happens through software, not mechanical clicking. Ten levels of pedal assist adjust seamlessly. Sport, Trail, All Purpose, and Conserve modes reshape the riding character without adding physical controls.
The visual result is clean surfaces throughout. The bike reads as intentionally minimal rather than stripped down, because the design removed complexity rather than hiding it.
Most e-bikes conceal batteries within frame tubes, prioritizing invisibility over accessibility. The TM-B makes power storage a designed interaction.
Two removable battery options (538Wh and 808Wh) twist free without tools. The larger capacity delivers 100-mile range, extraordinary for a vehicle this size. But range becomes secondary to the design thinking behind making batteries user-facing rather than integrated.

USB-C charging at up to 240W means these packs double as portable power banks. The batteries become part of your broader electronic ecosystem rather than single-purpose components. Pull a battery, charge your laptop at a coffee shop, return it to the bike. The design acknowledges that modern urban life revolves around managing multiple devices, not just transportation.

An e-ink display on each battery provides status without requiring phone connectivity, giving you physical feedback and immediate information. This creates designed confidence where you know exactly how much range remains before needing to swap or charge.
Integrated lighting typically means front and rear LEDs that meet minimum legal requirements. The TM-B’s lighting philosophy comes from automotive safety research.
Biomotion lighting highlights the rider’s body movement (head, arms, legs) rather than just illuminating the bike’s extremities. Studies show that drivers recognize moving human forms faster than static vehicle shapes, especially in peripheral vision. The lighting system transforms the rider into a more recognizable threat that drivers process earlier.

This isn’t decorative accent lighting but rather lighting as designed protective intervention. It borrows from decades of automotive human factors research and applies it to two-wheeled vulnerability.
Physical locks represent designed failure. Cable locks cut easily. U-locks require carrying bulk. Frame locks add weight. The TM-B makes theft functionally pointless through software architecture.
When you walk away, the bike automatically locks the battery, wheels, and frame. Not physically, but electronically. Attempt to ride a locked TM-B and nothing responds. The motor won’t engage. The battery won’t discharge. The entire vehicle becomes an expensive sculpture.
Remote bricking takes this further. Report a bike stolen, and ALSO can disable it remotely. The bike becomes worthless to a thief: not resellable, not rideable, not even useful for parts. Security becomes invisible, permanent, and comprehensive without adding physical bulk or weight.
Hydraulic disc brakes handle primary stopping. But regenerative braking captures energy during deceleration and feeds it back to the battery.
The design outcome: up to 25% range extension from energy that typically dissipates as heat. It’s not dramatic enough to feel like engine braking in an EV car. It’s subtle, seamless, almost unnoticeable, which represents successful design integration rather than engineered compromise.

The system demonstrates how automotive EV thinking translates to micromobility. Every descent, every slow-down, every controlled deceleration becomes an opportunity to extend range without conscious rider input.
Three trim levels don’t just offer different equipment but represent distinct design philosophies about what this platform should express.
The Launch Edition ($4,500, spring 2026) introduces the concept with unique blue, purple, and other launch finishes that communicate newness and differentiation. It’s ALSO announcing they’ve arrived with something visually distinct.
The Performance trim (same price, summer 2026) adds air suspension and higher output motor specs. Design shifts from introduction to capability. This version targets riders who prioritize dynamic range over value positioning.

The Base model (under $4,000, late 2026) strips back to essentials with 60-mile battery and simplified spec. The design message becomes accessibility: getting this platform’s core benefits to wider audiences without the premium finish work.
Each trim tells a clear story about who this bike serves and why. The pricing strategy keeps Performance and Launch identical, making the choice about timing and aesthetics rather than value hierarchy.
ALSO’s roadmap extends beyond two wheels to pedal-assisted quads designed for cargo delivery.
The TM-Q vehicles represent the same core philosophy applied to different constraints. Remove mechanical drivetrain limitations. Build software-defined platforms. Enable modular transformation. Optimize for bike lane operation rather than automotive infrastructure.

The design thread connecting the TM-B and TM-Q products is platform thinking: creating foundational architecture that supports multiple form factors rather than designing discrete vehicles. It’s how automotive manufacturers approach product development, now applied to micromobility at urban scale.
The TM-B doesn’t source components from Shimano, Bosch, or other e-bike suppliers. Rivian developed the battery, motor, electronics, and software in-house. This vertical integration enables design decisions impossible with off-the-shelf components. Where most e-bikes still rely on partial automotive supplier components, Rivian’s approach is pure ground-up integration applying full automotive engineering rigor to two-wheeled transport.
The pedal-by-wire system exists because Rivian controlled the entire drivetrain stack. The security architecture works because they own the software. The battery packaging succeeds because they designed the cells and the enclosures simultaneously.
What you see in the TM-B’s form is the physical manifestation of engineering control. Proportion and surface decisions made possible only when every component answers to a single design vision rather than marketplace constraints.

Over-the-air updates will refine this bike’s behavior throughout its life. The riding characteristics you experience at delivery represent a starting point, not a fixed state. Software-defined vehicles evolve. The TM-B’s design accommodates continuous improvement rather than planned obsolescence. Service and repairs happen at Rivian’s automotive service centers, not traditional bike shops, treating the TM-B as an extension of their vehicle ecosystem.
The ALSO TM-B demonstrates what becomes possible when automotive engineering rigor meets micromobility scale. It’s not about making bikes more expensive or complex but about removing century-old mechanical constraints and rebuilding around what riders actually need.
Modular transformation without tools. Batteries as portable power rather than hidden components. Security through software instead of physical locks. Drivetrain without mechanical compromise. Lighting that makes riders more visible through human factors research rather than brighter bulbs.
Rivian took their EV platform thinking (vertical integration, software-defined experiences, continuous improvement through updates) and scaled it to two wheels. The result challenges what we accept as inevitable in bicycle design.
The TM-B isn’t trying to be a better traditional bike. It’s showing what happens when you throw out the script entirely and rebuild from first principles. That’s what makes it worth studying, regardless of whether you ever plan to buy one.

36,2025-10-23,"Compared to the old 8-bit Arduinos, it’s incredible how cheap modern microcontrollers like the ESP32 have become. But there are even cheaper options out there if you don’t need that kind of horsepower, and are willing to do a little work yourself, as [atomic14] demonstrates.
The CH32V003 is a dirt cheap microcontroller—which can reportedly be had for as little as 10 cents if you know where to look. It’s not the most powerful chip by any means, boasting just 16 K flash, and 2 K of SRAM. However, it is a 32-bit RISC V machine, and it does run at 48 MHz—giving it a leg up on many 8-bit parts that are still out there.
Surprisingly there aren’t a whole lot of CH32V003 products for the maker market, so if you want to play with it, you’ll probably need to spin up your own boards. [atomic14] does just that, showing us how the chip can be put to good use by turning it into a little musical trinket. It’s a fun demo, and a great way to get to grips with programming on a new microcontroller platform.
It’s hard to get more chiptune than a 10 cent chip beeping its little head off. How could possibly justify spending tens of dollars modding a Game Boy when this exists, even if it sounds like a caffeinated greeting card?


YTDW. It’s well within the capability of these micros to play RTTL, and there’s loads of music out there in that format.

You guys aren’t going to believe it, but this seems to be BogdanTheGeek week:

Something that might be of interest to anyone doing a similar project might be an old bit of DOS software called Muzak. It had .muz files that were plain text and stored the menus along  with the songs themselves. The format was pretty easy to interpret. I wrote a few myself to extend it many years ago, but by default it came with around 100, if I recall correctly.  No doubt it would save people the effort of trying to transcribe midi or wav. There were so many good little utilities back then. Many with clever programming tricks.
The CH570 is a newer similar MCU that costs the same.
The Bond Theme playing in the video gave me instant flashbacks to a very cool program on the Amiga, back in the day, Aegis Sonix, which had the same melody – in a similar-quality rendition! – as one of its demo tunes. This was the very early Amiga days, before the far more sophisticated Tracker programs and OctaMED and so on.

Amazon stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) has a history of delivering impressive, rapid returns, with the stock achieving over 30% gains in less than two months on 13 separate occasions, notably in 2010 and 2020. If these historical patterns persist, upcoming catalysts could propel AMZN stock to extraordinary new highs, offering significant benefits to shareholders. 
Several high-growth areas are poised to drive Amazon's stock higher:
That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like AMZN, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
It undoubtedly helps if the financial fundamentals are solid. For insights on AMZN, visit Buy or Sell AMZN Stock. Below are some key metrics to note.
*LTM: Last Twelve Months
When considering risk, it’s useful to assess Amazon’s performance during challenging market conditions. It experienced a nearly 94% decline during the Dot-Com Bubble, which is substantial. The Global Financial Crisis affected it by approximately 65%, and the Inflation Shock of 2022 also had a severe impact, resulting in a decline of over 56%. Even less extreme events, such as the 2018 correction and the COVID-19 selloff, caused drops of around 34% and 23%, respectively. Look at – How Low Can Amazon Stock Really Go – for more details. Therefore, despite the favorable indicators, Amazon's past indicates that it can incur significant losses when the market declines.
However, risk is not confined to major market downturns. Stocks can decline even amid favorable market conditions – consider situations such as earnings announcements, business updates, and outlook revisions. To observe how the stock has bounced back from sharp downturns historically, refer to the AMZN Dip Buyer Analyses.
Remember, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics."

Digital cameras dressed in retro clothing have flooded the market lately, promising vintage vibes while delivering the same old pixels underneath. These cameras look like throwbacks from the outside, but they’re digital at heart, offering nostalgia as an aesthetic choice rather than a genuine photographic experience that connects you to the tactile reality of film.
The Lomography Lomo MC-A takes a completely different approach by being genuinely analogue while embracing one very modern convenience that makes daily use practical. This is a true 35 millimeter film camera with manual advance, glass optics, and real chemical processes, yet it includes USB-C charging to solve the battery headaches that plague most vintage cameras.
Designer: Lomography






The metal body, available in silver or black, feels substantial and built to last through years of shooting. The retractable 32 millimeter f/2.8 multi-coated glass lens delivers sharp, vibrant images with unmistakable film character. Manual film advance lever and tactile controls make every shot feel intentional, rewarding presence and patience over rapid digital capture.







Three shooting modes adapt to different skill levels and creative intentions without compromising the analogue experience. Program auto handles everything for point-and-shoot simplicity, aperture priority gives depth-of-field control while automating shutter speed, and full manual mode opens up complete creative freedom. Fast autofocus works from 0.4 meters, while manual zone focusing suits street photography perfectly.

USB-C charging is the defining feature that bridges analogue tradition with modern convenience in surprisingly effective ways. The rechargeable CR2 battery charges with the same cable you use for your phone or laptop, eliminating the hunt for obscure batteries that vintage cameras demand. This single detail makes the MC-A practical for everyday adventures without compromising its analogue soul.

The battery lasts up to ten rolls of film under typical shooting conditions and can be recharged over 1200 times, making the camera a reliable companion for years. This longevity eliminates the anxiety of dead batteries mid-roll or constant trips to specialty shops for replacements, issues that make vintage cameras frustrating for regular use.


Signature Lomography features like unlimited multiple exposures, long exposures, and included creative accessories set the MC-A apart from basic point-and-shoot cameras. The package includes a Splitzer lens attachment, colored gel filters, protective wrap, and leather accessories that enhance the shooting experience without requiring additional purchases or hunting for compatible vintage gear.

Lomography’s philosophy centers on feeling first, framing second, celebrating imperfection and spontaneity over pixel-perfect compositions. The MC-A is built for people who want to slow down, make tangible images, and focus on real moments rather than content optimized for algorithms. The camera encourages experimentation and presence, making photography feel like play rather than work.

The Lomography Lomo MC-A represents a genuine bridge between eras, offering authentic film photography with practical modern convenience. For anyone tired of digital nostalgia that’s only appearance deep, this camera proves that real analogue photography is still alive and easier to maintain than ever before.

Over the past decade, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has returned an impressive $83 Bil to its investors in the form of cash through dividends and buybacks. The payouts are only likely to pick up, as Nvidia retains the pole position in the AI silicon race, generating over $75 billion in operating cash flows over the last 12 months. 
Let's examine some statistics and see how this capacity for payouts compares with the market's top capital-return generators.
Interestingly, NVDA stock has provided the 25th largest total return to shareholders in history.
Why should you be concerned?
Because dividends and share repurchases are direct, tangible returns of capital to shareholders. They also indicate management's confidence in the company’s financial stability and its capacity to produce sustainable cash flows. There are additional stocks with similar characteristics. Here is a list of the top 10 companies ranked by the total capital returned to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.
Investing in a single stock can be risky, but there is significant advantage to a broader diversified approach, as seen with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Should you invest in one stock you favor or create a portfolio intended to succeed across various market cycles? Our data indicates that High Quality Portfolio has transformed stock-picking uncertainty into consistent market-outperforming results. This portfolio is part of the asset allocation strategy employed by Empirical Asset Management – a wealth manager in the Boston area and Trefis partner – whose asset allocation framework achieved positive returns during the 2008-09 financial crisis when the S&P fell by more than 40%.
Top 10 Stocks By Total Shareholder Return
 
For the complete ranking, visit Buybacks & Dividends Ranking
What stands out here? The aggregate capital returned to shareholders as a percentage of the current market capitalization seems inversely proportional to growth potential regarding reinvestments. Companies such as Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) display much faster growth, in a more predictable manner, than the others, but they have returned a significantly smaller share of their market value to shareholders.
That's the counterpoint to high capital returns. While appealing, it prompts the question: Am I forgoing growth and robust fundamentals? With this in mind, let's analyze some figures for NVDA. (see Buy or Sell NVIDIA Stock for more information)
NVIDIA Fundamentals
 
That provides a good summary, but assessing a stock from an investment viewpoint entails much more. That is precisely what Trefis High Quality Portfolio offers. It is tailored to mitigate stock-specific risk while providing upside potential.
NVDA Historical Risk
However, Nvidia is not safeguarded against significant declines. It plunged 68% during the Dot-Com bubble and experienced an even steeper drop of 85% in the Global Financial Crisis. During the inflation surge, it fell roughly 66%, while the corrections in 2018 and the Covid pandemic caused declines of 56% and 38%, respectively. Despite solid fundamentals, Nvidia's history indicates it can experience substantial losses during market downturns.
But the risk isn't confined to major market crashes. Stocks decline even in favorable market conditions – consider events like earnings reports, business updates, and changes in outlook. Read NVDA Dip Buyer Analyses to understand how the stock has rebounded from sharp declines in the past.
The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has a proven history of consistently outperforming its benchmark which includes all three – the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. Why is that? As a category, HQ Portfolio stocks have generated superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; providing a less volatile experience, as demonstrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Comcast (CMCSA) stock merits your attention. Why? Because it offers high margins at a reduced price. Sure, the stock has faced pressure from a cooling broadband market and rising competition from wireless carriers offering 5G based home broadband services. Yet, Comcast is finding new momentum in its wireless phone segment, while its vast network infrastructure remains a valuable asset as data consumption keeps soaring across streaming, gaming, live sports, and emerging AI-driven applications.
Here are some numbers.
While revenue growth is beneficial, this perspective is not solely about growth. Pricing power and high margins yield consistent, predictable profits and cash flows, which mitigates risk and facilitates capital reinvestment. The market tends to reward this behavior.
To provide some context, Comcast functions as a global media and technology corporation providing cable communications, television and streaming services, film studios, theme parks, and international media offerings.
 
 
However, do these figures convey the entire narrative? Examine Buy or Sell CMCSA Stock to determine if Comcast still possesses a competitive advantage that remains sound beneath the surface.
If you're looking for potential gains with less fluctuation than holding a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio (HQ) – HQ has outperformed its benchmark – a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap index, achieving returns of over 105% since its inception. Effective risk management is essential – consider how long-term portfolio performance might look if you combined 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto with HQ’s performance metrics.
 
Stocks Like These Can Outperform. Here Is Data
Here's our selection method: We assess stocks with a market cap greater than $10 billion, then filter out those with high cash flow from operations (CFO) margins or operating margins. We also consider only those stocks that have significantly decreased in valuation over the past year.
Below are the statistics for stocks using this selection strategy, applied since 12/31/2016.
But Consider The Risk
Nonetheless, CMCSA isn’t shielded from significant downturns. It dropped 44% during the Dot-Com Bubble and 62% during the Global Financial Crisis. The inflation shock resulted in a 52% decline, while the corrections of 2018 and the Covid pandemic each eliminated around 28-31%. Even robust companies feel pressure when the market turns adverse. Risk is genuine, regardless of the positives.
The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which comprises 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably surpassing its benchmark, which includes all three – the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. What is the reason? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks achieved better returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; a smoother ride, as illustrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

The Tears of the Kingdom Ganondorf Figma launches next month, and Princess Zelda completes the collection in January.
By 
    Steven Petite
   on October 23, 2025 at 11:26AM PDT
 Ganondorf Figma - The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom 
 $130 | Releases November 12 
 Princess Zelda Figma - The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom 
 $130 | Releases January 14 
Good Smile's The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Figma figures are available to preorder at Amazon for the first time in many months. The Ganondorf Figma disappeared from Amazon last October, but you can preorder the collectible action figure for $130 ahead of its November 12 launch in the US. The Princess Zelda Figma is also available to preorder for $130. Zelda had been sold out since April, so fans have another opportunity to reserve one before its January 14, 2026 release.
Both figures are sold by Japanese collectible sellers and fulfilled by Amazon US. Since they ship directly from Amazon, the retailer's free 30-day return policy is offered for both figures. Ganondorf preorders originally opened for $97 last summer, so you do have to spend more now if you weren't able to secure a preorder from the jump. The Zelda Figma was briefly sold for $95 last holiday before climbing to $120; Amazon itself was charging this price, so the Zelda markup is only $10.
Based on the prices the now hard-to-find Link Figma figures are selling for on Amazon, it's very likely $130 will soon be viewed as a ""low"" price. The standard edition Link Figma launched in June for $90, but preorders originally sold for $70. And if you want to buy the Link Figma right now? It's up to $100 from third-party resellers (fulfilled by Amazon). Link's DX Edition with a bunch of extra accessories released in May for $136. Today, the price for the DX Edition from resellers on Amazon is $190 minimum (not fulfilled by Amazon).
Release Date: November 12, 2025
Good Smile's Ganondorf Figma is an authentic 7.5-inch collectible figure with intricate details that impressively capture the Demon King's appearance in Tear of the Kingdom. Like most Figma action figures, Ganondorf has many articulated joints, a bunch of swappable accessories, and an adjustable display stand that allow fans to create a bunch of different poses. You'll find multiple of Ganondorf's signature weapons from the Nintendo Switch game inside the box, including the Gloom Sword and Scabbard, the Gloom Spear, and the Demon King's Bow. You'll also get three expressive face sculpts--standard, shouting, and goading--and eight swappable hands. Here's the full list of accessories:
Release Date: January 14, 2026
Like the other Figma figures, you're not only getting an incredibly accurate 6-inch replica of Princess Zelda as she appears in Tears of the Kingdom, but also a ton of accessories to help recreate iconic moments from the Breath of the Wild sequel. With this release, you're getting an optional closed-eyes face to recreate her prayer scenes, a serious face for serious times, and swappable hands. Notable accessories include the Decayed Master Sword and Purah Pad. Here's the full list of accessories:

IBM stock (NYSE: IBM) dropped 7% in after-hours trading on October 22, 2025, despite reporting a strong earnings performance. This decline was driven by investor worries regarding slowing growth in the crucial software segment of the company, which overshadowed an otherwise solid quarterly outcome. IBM announced adjusted earnings per share of $2.65, significantly surpassing the $2.45 consensus estimate, while revenue totaled $16.33 billion compared to the anticipated $16.09 billion. In this assessment, we analyze IBM’s Q3 results and consider whether the stock's drop creates an opportunity or signifies deeper worries about growth sustainability.​
Nevertheless, if you’re looking for a potential upside with less volatility than owning an individual stock like IBM, you might want to explore the High Quality Portfolio. This portfolio has significantly outperformed its benchmark, which includes a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes, achieving returns of over 105% since its inception. What accounts for this success? Overall, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered higher returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; it’s been a steadier ride, as demonstrated by the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
IBM achieved revenue growth of 9% year-over-year to $16.33 billion, marking its best quarterly performance in recent times. The adjusted earnings per share of $2.65 indicated a 15% increase compared to the previous year. What fueled this performance? The company saw strong demand for its latest AI-optimized mainframe systems and ongoing success in its automation software, which grew 24%. However, the software division's growth of 10% to $7.21 billion only met consensus expectations without exceeding them, raising concerns about the viability of IBM's AI-driven transformation. Even more concerning for investors, Red Hat's constant-currency revenue growth slowed to 12% from 14% in the last quarter, sparking analyst worries about this critical component of IBM's software strategy.​
Is IBM's valuation appealing after the post-earnings drop? With the stock currently trading around $270 and analyst price targets averaging $286, there seems to be limited upside potential even following the recent 7% decline. The stock has already gained around 30% year-to-date, showcasing investor confidence regarding IBM's AI positioning. However, at a trailing P/E ratio of approximately 45 times, IBM is trading at a somewhat high multiple in relation to its growth outlook. The challenge is that much of the AI-driven growth narrative may already be incorporated into the current valuation, leaving minimal margin for error should software growth continue to underperform. While management's updated guidance for full-year revenue growth of over 5% and free cash flow of $14 billion offers some reassurance, these projections seem increasingly ambitious given the slowdown in the software segment.​
Could IBM experience further pressure amid wider market turmoil? Historical data indicates that IBM has shown relative resilience compared to growth stocks during significant market corrections. During the inflation surge of 2022, IBM's stock decreased by 20.2% from a peak of $145.21 on June 11, 2021, to $115.81 on November 26, 2021, while the S&P 500 suffered a peak-to-trough drop of 25.4%. Similarly, during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, IBM's stock fell 39.0% from a high of $149.08 on February 12, 2020, to $90.97 on March 23, 2020, in comparison to a 33.9% drop in the S&P 500. See – How Low Can IBM Stock Really Go – Although these declines were significant, IBM's performance in times of market stress has typically been more defensive than that of high-growth technology stocks, reflecting its established business model and dividend yield.
Remember, investing in a standalone stock without thorough analysis can be risky. Look into the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to deliver strong returns for investors. What is the reason for this success? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks has provided a responsive means to capitalize on favorable market conditions while minimizing losses when markets decline, as outlined in RV Portfolio performance metrics.
Does IBM's current situation deserve investor confidence? The company’s capability to exceed earnings expectations while enhancing full-year guidance reflects operational strength, particularly in leveraging AI demand across its mainframe and automation sectors. With its AI business portfolio now surpassing $9.5 billion and strong free cash flow generation, IBM seems well-equipped to navigate the ongoing technology transition.
Nevertheless, the deceleration in Red Hat's growth and the software division's failure to surpass expectations raise doubts regarding the sustainability of IBM's transformation narrative. Considering the limited upside potential based on current analyst targets and the stock’s already significant gains year-to-date, investors may wish to wait for clearer signs of software acceleration before increasing their holdings, even though the recent decline has created a more attractive entry point."

Satya Nadella's total pay for the latest fiscal year has been revealed, and the gap between his pay and what the median worker makes is growing.
By 
    Eddie Makuch
   on October 23, 2025 at 8:40AM PDT
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's total pay package for fiscal 2025 has been confirmed, and the executive earned a total of $96.5 million for the year. That is up 22% from the previous year and represents his highest-ever annual pay. It's a massive multiple over what the median Microsoft worker makes, with the median worker taking home around $200,000.
The executive's pay details are coming to light as the company faces scrutiny over its recent Xbox decisions, including layoffs, game cancellations, studio closures, price hikes, and increasing profit-margin mandates. The company as a whole has faced ongoing criticism as well due to its slate of mass layoffs, partnership with Israel, and investments in AI, among other things.
Nadella is paid a $2.5 million salary, a figure that's been the same since 2019. The majority of his pay for fiscal 2025 came from stock awards, making up $84.2 million (87%) of his total pay. Microsoft revealed all of this as part of a regulatory filing disclosed this week, as reported by The Seattle Times.
Nadella also makes money from an annual cash bonus--for this latest fiscal year, Nadella got paid a bonus of $9.56 million. The bonus he got last year--$5.2 million--was millions less than this year. That's because he requested a lower cash bonus for 2024 due in part to cyberattacks against Microsoft.
The median pay for a Microsoft employee, excluding Nadella's pay, rose in fiscal 2025 to $200,972, up from $193,744. At the same time, the delta between Nadella's pay and the median Microsoft salary is growing, reaching 480-to-1 for fiscal 2025--that's up from 250-to-1 in 2023.
The regulatory filing revealing Nadella's latest pay included a memo from Microsoft's board of directors saying the CEO's efforts to push on artificial intelligence helped Microsoft's fortunes overall in the latest fiscal year. ""His leadership team have positioned Microsoft as a clear artificial intelligence leader for this generational technology shift,"" the board said.
Microsoft reached a $4 trillion market cap this year and the company's stock also reached an all-time high of more than $535 earlier this year. Microsoft is the No. 2 most valuable company in the world right now, only trailing Nvidia.
Nadella became CEO of Microsoft in 2014, taking over for Steve Ballmer. He is just the third CEO of Microsoft, following Bill Gates and Ballmer. Since Nadella took over as CEO, Microsoft's stock price has risen from about $36 in 2014 to more than $520 today, an increase of more than 1,300%.
Recently, Microsoft made headlines again over a report that said CFO Amy Hood has implemented a new profit-margin mandate for Xbox of 30%, which is well above industry standards. Many have theorized that this reported mandate has contributed to some of the decisions Microsoft has made in recent times, including bringing its first-party games to rival platforms, raising prices on consoles and Game Pass, investing in automation technologies with AI, canceling games, closing studios, and laying off workers.
Sources told Bloomberg that Microsoft will look to focus on producing titles that are ""cheap to make"" or more likely to generate revenue as opposed to ""riskier bets.""
Microsoft will publish its next earnings report on October 29, at which time the company's financial fortunes for the latest quarter will be revealed.

Broadcom stock (NASDAQ: AVGO) has a historical pattern of vulnerability to sharp downturns. On two separate occasions in past years, the stock dropped by over 30% in less than two months, wiping out billions in market capitalization and quickly erasing significant investor gains. 
If this historical volatility is any indicator, AVGO stock remains susceptible to abrupt, steep declines. 
Several brewing risks could fuel future volatility in Broadcom's share price:
That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like AVGO, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
It certainly helps alleviate risk when the fundamentals are positive. For more details on AVGO, read Buy or Sell AVGO Stock. Below are several important figures.
*LTM: Last Twelve Months
When assessing risk, it is beneficial to observe how AVGO performs during significant market pullbacks. In 2018, the stock experienced a decline of approximately 27% from peak to trough. The COVID-19 pandemic affected it more severely, resulting in a nearly 48% drop. During the inflation crisis, the decrease was around 35%. See – How Low Can Broadcom Stock Really Go – for more details. Even with solid fundamentals, AVGO remains vulnerable to sharp declines when the broader market drops. Strong quality can help soften the fall, but downturns are still painful.
However, risks are not confined to significant market crashes. Stocks may decline even when markets are performing well – consider events like earnings reports, corporate announcements, and changes in outlook. Read AVGO Dip Buyer Analyses to learn how the stock has rebounded from significant declines in history.
Remember, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics."

UnitedHealth (UNH)’s stock jumped 31% in three months, driven not only by a slight increase in revenue and a high P/E multiple, but also amid mixed signals: a Q2 earnings miss, regulatory scrutiny, and renewed investments in AI. What’s behind this volatility? 
Let’s explore the factors that led to the rise.
So what is taking place here? The stock increased by 31%, boosted by a 3.1% rise in revenue and a 35% increase in P/E multiple, despite a 6.6% decrease in net margin. Let’s analyze the events leading to these changes.
Before we delve into details of events that contributed to the stock’s rise, here’s what market wisdom suggests: Investing in a single stock can be risky, but there is substantial merit in adopting a more diversified strategy, such as the one we propose with the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
Opinion: We currently view UNH stock as appealing. Why is that? Take a look at the complete overview. Read Buy or Sell UNH Stock to understand what informs our current viewpoint.
Risk: When evaluating the risk associated with UNH, it’s enlightening to review its declines during major market downturns. The stock plummeted approximately 42% during the Dot-Com crash and over 72% in the Global Financial Crisis. Even the 2018 correction and the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in declines exceeding 20% and 35%, respectively. The inflation shock was less severe, yet it still saw a near 18% drop. See – How Low Can UNH Stock Really Go – for more details. Solid fundamentals at UNH do not shield it from substantial sell-offs when broader market decreases occur. Risk is pervasive, regardless of the company's status.
Consistently selecting winners is quite challenging - particularly given the volatility tied to a single stock. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics."

Yahoo Finance reports that the stock prices of Apple have reached an all-time high on intraday market at about $264.38. The last highest intraday record of Apple was set during the previous year on December 26th at $260.10. The record was achieved due to the strong demand for the new iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max and base iPhone 17 models, as reported by Wall Street analysts and others.
The iPhone Air sales have been underwhelming, but the device sold out in hours in China compared to other countries that have put the iPhone Air model up for sale. The company is still lagging behind Google and OpenAI in terms of AI. Just recently, software engineers of the company have raised concerns regarding the revamped version of Siri in terms of its performance in the iOS 26.4 internal beta. On October 30th, the quarterly earnings of the company will see another report.

50,2025-10-23,"The UK keeps advancing its Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) legislation, which is fairly similar to Europe's Digital Markets Act (DMA). The government published that it had finished its legal tests and discovered that ""Apple and Google both have substantial, entrenched market power and a position of strategic significance in their respective mobile platforms and have been designated with strategic market status (SMS).""
With that, the UK government might officially start the process of requiring Apple and Google to open up their stores to third-party marketplaces, in addition to third-party payment systems, offering more options as the default browser, and more.
While the UK hasn't started the process yet, a press release says that placing Apple and Google on the strategic market status doesn't mean they have been found guilty of ""wrongdoing and does not introduce any immediate requirements."" However, the government wants to ensure that mobile platforms are ""open to effective competition, and that consumers and businesses that rely on Google and Apple can have confidence that they are treated fairly.""
Speaking to the BBC, Apple said UK users could lose access to new features if the government adds EU-like restrictions. For example, some Apple Intelligence features aren't available for EU users, in addition to iPhone Mirroring for the Mac and the ability to control someone else's iPhone via FaceTime.
The company said in a statement: ""Apple faces fierce competition in every market where we operate, and we work tirelessly to create the best products, services and user experience. The UK's adoption of EU-style rules would undermine that, leaving users with weaker privacy and security, delayed access to new features, and a fragmented, less seamless experience.""
In the press release, the UK government says that it's just following what many other regions have done, as it wants to continue to support businesses and consumers dependent on mobile platforms, as the U.S., the EU, and Japan have already done. BGR will let you know once the UK government takes further action with the CMA against Apple and Google."

MP Materials (NYSE:MP), the foremost producer of rare-earth elements in America, has emerged as one of the remarkable narratives of 2025. Shares are currently trading close to $70, having increased nearly 5x year-to-date as investors flock to the U.S. rare-earth revival narrative. This upsurge indicates a growing confidence that MP’s long-term goal—developing a fully domestic supply chain for essential EV and defense metals—is finally materializing. However, with the stock already appreciating almost five times, a pertinent question arises: can MP double again, reaching $150 or more per share? Let’s analyze the rationale. The recent decline has left investors pondering: is this merely a sharp correction in an overheated stock, or the beginning of a more profound reckoning for one of the fastest-growing entities in mobile advertising? Separately see, Can Lithium Americas Stock Double Again?
If you’re looking for potential gains with less volatility than owning a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns surpassing 105% since its inception.  
MP Materials generated approximately $204 million in revenue for 2024, hindered by declining rare-earth prices and initial costs associated with its magnet facility. However, 2025 marks a significant turning point: output from its Mountain Pass separation facility and newly established Fort Worth magnet plant is increasing, paving the way for a transition from low-margin mining to higher-margin manufacturing.
Analysts predict a significant acceleration in revenue over the next two years as downstream volumes increase, with EBITDA potentially climbing toward $500–700 million by 2027. The real narrative here goes beyond top-line growth — it hinges on margin expansion and operational leverage as MP shifts from raw materials to finished products.
Currently, MP trades at a high 52× EV/EBITDA, implying that the market is already factoring in years of growth and flawless execution. Should MP meet its 2027 profitability objectives, and the multiple decreases to about 40x—an amount more in line with other high-tech materials or defense-related manufacturers—this level of earnings growth would yield an enterprise value surpassing $25 billion — roughly double current figures — translating into a share price between $140 and $150. In other words, MP doesn't need higher multiples to appreciate; it merely needs to grow into its existing ratio.
At around $70 per share, MP Materials has already factored in a significant turnaround — but not necessarily the entire downstream earnings potential. If EBITDA expands as anticipated and the company meets its production targets, MP could evolve to match its current valuation and beyond, making a $140–150 share price a plausible medium-term goal.
That said, this is no longer a deep-value scenario — it’s a high-expectation execution narrative. MP must now demonstrate that its shift from miner to magnet-maker can yield consistent profitability. If successful, the rewards could be substantial.
 To mitigate stock-specific risk while gaining exposure to potential upside, consider examining the High Quality portfolio, which has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception.  Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks offered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster experience as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics."

53,2025-10-23,"In the mid-1990s, a line of pellet-filled plush toys ignited one of the oddest speculative booms of the early internet. Beanie Babies, introduced by Ty Inc. in 1993, were suddenly treated less like playthings and more like assets to be flipped and stored. By late 1998, Tyâs annual sales had surged past the billion-dollar markâand all the while, resale activity was thriving on emerging online platforms, indicating just how far the Beanie Baby mania had spread. Looking at the craze by the numbers reveals how supply constraints, feedback loops, and market microstructure pushed prices far beyond fundamentalsâand how the same forces eventually sent them back to earth.
From the outset, Ty Warnerâwho introduced Beanie Babies under this company, Ty Inc., and them for about $5 apieceâavoided big-box chains and placed the toys only in independent gift and specialty stores. This distribution choice that cultivated exclusivity on the shelf.
He soon engineered scarcity at the store level: Many retailers were allowed only 36 of each character per month, ensuring that even popular styles felt perpetually hard to find. Scarcity was reinforced through regular âretirements,â and designs were discontinued with little notice, prompting rushes to buy what might never return.
Meanwhile, tag quirks from misprints to poem and birthday variations became signals of rarity. Pinchers the Lobster, for example, originally bore a tag labeled âPunchers.â Whether that was a misprint or a renaming is debatable, but collectors came to prize the variant.Â 
This combinationâsmall-shop distribution, strict per-store limits, frequent retirements, and collectible-coded tagsâlaid the quantitative foundations of the bubble. Demand outpaced visible supply and prices crept above retail, and a feedback loop formed. Those mechanics were firmly in place by 1996, setting the stage for the online mania that followed.
Ty Inc. was an early adopter of the web: In 1996, it launched ty.com and printed the URL on hang tags, making it one of the first toy companies to push consumers online. The site became the official venue for announcing new releases and retirements for Beanie Babies, with each update sending ripples through the collector community.
This online ecosystem gave rise to a robust secondary market. Email newsletters, price guides, and collector forums translated rumors into trading signals, while the print world mirrored the mania: Mary Bethâs Bean Bag World debuted in 1997 with 177,000 copies in its first issue; the second issue jumped to 444,045 copies, reflecting extraordinary demand for pricing data and news. 
The biggest engine of sales and trading activity was eBay: By 1997, Beanie Baby auctions on the platform reportedly totaled roughly $500 million, more than 6 percent of eBayâs business, and by and during the 1998 holiday season, there were times that 7 percent of all listings on the site were Beanie Babies. At the peak, the average resale price hovered around $30, six times retail, and some, like the âPrincess Dianaâ bear, fetched hundreds.
Mainstream outlets amplified the frenzy. The news reported store stampedes and thefts, and what began as a quirky online fad hardened into a market with real liquidity and speculative fever. These were classic bubble dynamicsâself-reinforcing cycles where rising prices fuel demand, only to unravel once confidence breaks.
Add Mental Floss as a preferred news source!
By 1998, Ty Inc.âs annual sales surpassed $1.4 billion, a figure widely reported in serious outlets covering the crazeâs apex. The single biggest accelerant is considered to be McDonaldâs 1997 âTeenie Beaniesâ Happy Meal promotion.
Contemporary reporting documents the scale of the promotional campaign: the Los Angeles Times reported that it âresult[ed] in the distribution of 100 million Beanie Babies â¦ in less than a month,â while The Washington Post quoted a McDonaldâs spokesperson saying Happy Meal sales doubled during that first Teenie Beanies run.
By this point, cultural saturation was obvious: Beanie Babies were treated as investments in mainstream coverage, with families publicly described as stockpiling toys for college funds and nest eggs. One widely covered case profiled a family who spent $100,000 during the frenzy.
Everyday scenes captured the maniaâs texture: pre-dawn lines outside shops on release days, sell-outs within hours, and security issues as demand spiked. National outlets chronicled store stampedes and thefts tied to Beanie shipments with law-enforcement stories from the period include seizures of tens of thousands of dollars in Beanies tied to fencing operations.
Financial media treated the plush market like a tradable asset: Analysts and commentators drew direct parallels between Beanie Baby price movements and more traditional investments, and prices and style groupings were tracked as if they were equities, reflecting the secondary market that had taken shape via eBay.
By late 1999, the Beanie Baby market started unraveling. Ty Inc. announced that all Beanie Babies would be retired on December 31, 1999. The stunt was intended to rekindle demand, but instead spurred panic selling and uncertainty in the secondary market.
The real damage, however, came from oversupply. Production had surged at the height of the craze, and by the year 2000, collectors were overwhelmed with inventory. Retailers and households alike were left with bins of unsold stock. The scarcity that once powered the bubble had been eroded, and the market was saturated. Eventually collections were selling for an estimated 2 percent of the 1998 highs, leaving most collections worth only a fraction of what had been spent on them.
The collapse was swiftâand total. Once-prized toys ended up at flea markets, garage sales, and donation bins. Families that had poured thousands into plush âinvestmentsâ discovered their hoards were nearly worthless. Only a very small number of unusual or particularly scarce models maintained modest resale value. The vast majority never regained even their original $5 price tag.
The Beanie Baby collapse underscored a critical truth about speculative markets: scarcity and hype, rather than fundamentals, often drive demand. When collectors believe that limited supply guarantees rising value, prices can detach from realityâthen, once confidence breaks, the illusion of scarcity is exposed, and values collapse.
Human behavior played a central role in the Beanie Baby bubble:
These same dynamics repeat whenever markets treat consumer goods like financial instruments.
Modern parallels abound. The NFT boom showed how digital collectibles could command astronomical prices, only for floor values of leading collections to plunge in a matter of months. Similarly, sneaker resale markets thrive on engineered scarcity, with limited-edition drops being flipped instantly at multiples of retail. The current craze for Labubusâplush figures from Pop Mart that inspire rave-like gatheringsâhas demonstrated the persistence of speculative fervor. Select Labubu models have already sold for over $100,000 at auction.
The quant lesson is straightforward: Collectibles are illiquid, opaque, and sentiment-driven markets. Once momentum fades, the market clears ruthlessly, leaving only a handful of genuine rarities with lasting value.
Is your Beanie Baby really worth thousands now?
According to eBay listings, some Beanie Babies have sold for tens of thousands of dollarsâbut thereâs good reason to be skeptical of those numbers: A 2021 investigation by Motherboard points out that the listing for a Princess bear that supposedly sold for $25,000 was created by a seller with no history, who then marked it as sold â¦ and relisted in for $17,000. By digging a little deeper, Motherboard discovered that the $25k had a line through it, which means that the toy actually went for the best offer, a number thatâs not disclosed. As Beanie Baby historian Leon Scholssberg explained, âThose are bogus â¦ Youâll see somebody who lists a Beanie Baby for $14,000. Theyâll have an accomplice buy it and then theyâll cancel the transaction â¦ and itâll disappear from eBay.â
The Beanie Baby saga endures as both a cultural memory and an economic parable. What began as a childrenâs toy line became a global case study in how scarcity, rumor, and clever marketing inflated ordinary goods into speculative assets. At the maniaâs peak, households treated stuffed animals like stocks, convinced that limited supply guaranteed lasting value. When oversupply and shifting sentiment arrived, however, the illusion collapsed almost overnight.
Behind every bubble lies the same ingredients: engineered scarcity, herd psychology, and the numbers that briefly validate the mania. The Beanie Baby crash reminds us that markets driven by hype are fragile, and that true value rarely matches the frenzy. Itâs a lesson in why numbers should always be tested before belief turns into speculation.

Redwood Materials, the battery recycling startup run by Tesla cofounder JB Straubel, just raised $350 million in a funding round that pushes its valuation past $6 billion.
The deal, led by Eclipse with participation from Nvidia's venture capital arm NVentures, supports Redwood's surprising new role powering the generative AI boom.
At first glance, a company known for reclaiming metals such as cobalt, nickel, and lithium might seem far removed from the realm of large language models and GPU clusters. But as AI data centers multiply across the US, power has become a defining bottleneck. Redwood's growing grid energy storage business aims to solve that.
Back in June, the startup unveiled Redwood Energy to help power the AI revolution by repurposing used batteries into energy storage systems. Its massive new battery installations store electricity at low cost, releasing it during high-demand periods to stabilize the grid and feed energy-hungry data centers.
Eclipse's Joe Fath, a former T. Rowe Price fund manager who backed Tesla early on, helped drive the latest funding round. Nvidia's involvement as a strategic investor is also notable as the chip giant seeks ways to keep the AI boom energized.
""This energy business is a really exciting opportunity for them to go attack,"" Fath told Business Insider in an interview. ""They have a unique opportunity to build out battery energy storage solutions and leverage all kinds of power generation, whether it be solar, wind, industrial gas turbines and ultimately nuclear, to power data centers that are off grid.""
Straubel and other Redwood leaders initially pitched the energy business to Fath in August 2024 and the company went live with AI data center provider Crusoe this June, less than a year later.
""Time to market is extremely quick,"" Fath added. ""They have a very strong and proven ability to scale.""
Fath also likes how Redwood has evolved over time, with each new business getting better in terms of financial returns.
The startup's original business of recycling EV batteries, which started back in 2017, was a ""wedge,"" Fath said. A more recent move to manufacture Cathode Active Material is promising but takes big upfront investment that will take time to recoup. In contrast, Redwood's energy installations start generating revenue quicker, Fath said.
He expects Redwood to add solutions in the future that help customers manage energy production and storage together more efficiently.
Redwood's two-pronged approach, critical materials and energy storage, positions it as both a new-age miner and power provider for the AI age. By recycling key minerals domestically and integrating them into advanced battery systems, Straubel's company is tackling two national challenges at once: energy security and technological competitiveness.
""We need to have energy independence and protect sovereignty in the US,"" Fath said. ""So it plays into their strengths.""
The timing is critical. With foreign supply chains tightening and renewable generation still intermittent, Redwood's US-made storage systems could help unlock stranded grid capacity and enable faster AI deployment. The company's systems, designed with sophisticated power electronics and software, aim to complement natural gas and future nuclear plants, boosting efficiency and reliability.
Armed with fresh capital, Redwood said it plans to expand its refining, materials production, and storage deployments while recruiting engineers to ""shape the next era of American energy leadership and critical minerals independence.""

If there’s one smartphone that fashion lovers and trendsetters have been obsessing over, it’s the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip7. This premium flip phone isn’t just a tech gadget, it’s a statement piece that solves the eternal struggle of wanting a full-sized smartphone that actually fits in your pocket.
Here’s the good news: Samsung seems to be quietly moving stock through Amazon rather than their official site, and right now you can snag this 256GB beauty for $849 instead of the usual $1,099. That’s a $250 discount on a phone that rarely sees price cuts this aggressive, and honestly, we’re kind of obsessed.
See at Amazon
The Galaxy Z Flip7 addresses something we’ve all felt: that moment when you’re trying to stuff your phone into a clutch, a tight jeans pocket or a small bag and it just won’t cooperate. This phone literally folds in half and gives you all the screen real estate you need when it’s open (perfect for scrolling, watching videos, or texting), then collapsing into a compact square that slips anywhere. It’s the best of both worlds without compromise.
Samsung has genuinely improved the FlexWindow on the Z Flip7, that outside screen you get when you close the phone. This no longer just shows notifications: With this new MultiStar integration, you get to personalize this external cover screen with your favorite apps, your widgets and shortcuts. This revamped edge-to-edge display gets everything more in reach, gets rid of that awkward moment of reaching for your phone for just about anything.
Now Bar feature warrants a special mention as it actually simplifies your life. This smart strip on your cover screen gives you contextual information during your day. Watching a sports game? You get live scores. In the middle of a workout? You get your progress. Waiting for a delivery? You get your tracking information there. All this comes without opening your phone, which translates to staying informed but not getting bogged down in that endless scroll pit.
Google Gemini integration with FlexWindow raises the bar for convenience: You’re able to carry on complete conversations with Gemini’s AI assistant directly from the cover screen, asking questions, making reminders, or getting directions without taking your hands off the wheel. Galaxy AI-driven Now Brief identifies your patterns and automatically brings to your attention personalized information, such as your day’s calendar summary in the morning, bad-weather alerts, or traffic for your commute.
The FlexCam feature is where this phone comes into its own for content creators, as well as for selfie takers: Since the phone is able to support itself at different angles at a partially unfolded state, you’re provided with a built-in tripod for hand’s free photos as well as videos. Auto Zoom ensures that you’re always perfectly framed, whether you’re alone or with a crowd, automatically zooming in to get everyone in shot. No more struggling to hold your phone at arms length or asking strangers for a photo.
Under the hood, the Z Flip7 won’t compromise on performance for its slender body. Multitasking with its powerful processor, from playing games to video editing, will come easy, as will not having to constantly search for power outlets with its all-day battery. With storage of 256GB, you get ample storage for your photos, apps, and videos with no worries about running out of storage space. This matters as you’ll be taking lots of high-quality shots with a 50MP main camera.
This is an unlocked phone with a full one-year factory warranty from Samsung, which means you’re free to use it with any wireless carrier and won’t worry about quality. This phone at a price of just $849 offers an all-time lowest price for a phone that was originally launched at a price of $1,099 a few months ago.

Visa (NYSE:V) is expected to announce its Q4 FY’25 earnings (September fiscal year) on or around Tuesday, October 28, 2025. The revenue is anticipated to increase by approximately 10% year-over-year to $10.6 billion, based on consensus forecasts, while earnings are estimated to be around $2.97 per share. This growth is projected to be fueled by strong payment volumes, underpinned by robust consumer spending in both discretionary and nondiscretionary segments. Particularly, cross-border payments are expected to continue being a significant strength. Value-added services (VAS) are also anticipated to be a crucial contributor to its growth trajectory. During Q3 FY’25, VAS revenue rose by 26% year-over-year, spearheaded by AI-enhanced fraud detection, real-time analytics, digital checkouts, and various payment security solutions.
The company has a current market capitalization of $618 billion. In the past twelve months, its revenue was $39 billion, and it achieved operational profitability, with $26 billion in operating profits and $20 billion in net income. Much will depend on how the results compare to forecasts and expectations; nevertheless, understanding historical patterns could give you an edge if you are an event-driven trader.
There are two approaches to achieve that: either grasp the historical probabilities and position yourself before the earnings announcement, or assess the relationship between short-term and medium-term returns following earnings releases and adjust your position accordingly thereafter. However, if you are looking for upside with lower volatility compared to individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfoliooffers an alternative – it has outperformed the S&P 500 and yielded returns exceeding 105% since its inception.

Here are some insights on one-day (1D) post-earnings returns:
Additional information regarding the observed 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns post earnings are summarized below along with the pertinent statistics in the table.
A somewhat less risky approach (although not advantageous if the correlation is low) involves examining the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns post earnings, identifying a pair that exhibits the highest correlation, and executing the respective trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D demonstrate the highest correlation, a trader can position themselves as “long” for the next 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is favorable. Below is some correlation data derived from both 5-year and 3-year (more recent) histories. Note that the correlation 1D_5D pertains to the connection between 1D post-earnings returns and the subsequent 5D returns.

57,2025-10-23,"Just 37 years old, Chen Zhi is accused of being ""the mastermind behind a sprawling cyber-fraud empire… a criminal enterprise built on human suffering"".
With his wispy goatee beard and baby-faced features, he looks even younger than he is. He has certainly become very wealthy, very quickly.
Last week the US Department of Justice charged him with running scam compounds in Cambodia that stole billions in cryptocurrency from victims all over the world. The US Treasury Department has confiscated more than $14bn (£10.5bn) worth of bitcoin that it says is linked to him - it said this was the largest ever crypto-currency seizure.
His own company, the Cambodian Prince Group, describes him on its website as ""a respected entrepreneur and renowned philanthropist"" whose ""vision and leadership have transformed Prince Group into a leading business group in Cambodia that adheres to international standards"". The BBC has contacted the Prince Group for comment.
So, how much do we know about Chen Zhi, the mysterious figure allegedly running a scam empire?
Brought up in Fujian province in south-eastern China, he started with a small, and apparently not very successful internet gaming company, and moved to Cambodia in either late 2010 or 2011, where he began working in the then-booming real estate sector.
His arrival coincided with the start of a speculative property boom in Cambodia. It was fuelled by the availability of large tracts of land expropriated by powerful, politically-connected figures and by a flood of Chinese capital.
Some of it was pouring in on the tail end of Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative to export Chinese-made infrastructure, and some of it was from individual Chinese investors seeking more affordable alternatives to China's overheated property market. The number of Chinese tourists visiting Cambodia was also rising fast.
The skyline of the capital Phnom Penh changed dramatically. The characterful, low-rise cityscape of mustard-coloured French colonial mansions was transformed into another Asian high-rise forest of glass and steel towers.
The transformation of Sihanoukville, a once quiet little seaside resort, was even more extreme. It was not just Chinese holidaymakers and property speculators heading there, but also gamblers - gambling is illegal in China.
New casinos sprang up, alongside gaudy, luxury hotels and apartment blocks. There was plenty of money to be made.
Even so, Chen Zhi's trajectory was startling.
In 2014 he became a Cambodian citizen, giving up his Chinese nationality. This enabled him to buy land in his own name, but required a minimum investment or donation to the government of $250,000.
It was never clear where Chen Zhi's money came from. When applying for a bank account on the Isle of Man in 2019 he listed an unnamed uncle who he said had given him $2m to start his first property company in 2011, but no evidence for this was ever provided.
Chen Zhi founded the Prince Group in 2015, focused on property development, when he was still only 27 years old. 
He got a commercial banking licence in 2018 to establish Prince Bank. The same year he obtained a Cypriot passport, in return for a minimum investment there of $2.5m, giving him easy access to the European Union. He later acquired Vanuatu citizenship as well.
He started Cambodia's third airline, and in 2020 obtained a certificate to operate a fourth. There were luxury malls in Phnom Penh built by the Prince property arm, five-star hotels in Sihanoukville, and an ambitious scheme to construct a $16bn  ""eco-city"" called ""Bay of Lights"" there.
In 2020 Chen Zhi was awarded the highest title bestowed by Cambodia's king, that of ""Neak Oknha"", which requires a donation of at least $500,000 to the government. 
He had already been made an official adviser to Interior Minister Sar Kheng since 2017, was a business partner with his son Sar Sokha, and an official adviser to Cambodia's most powerful man Hun Sen, and later his son Hun Manet after he succeeded his father as prime minister in 2023.
Chen Zhi was lauded in the local media as a philanthropist, who had funded scholarships for low-income students and donated substantially to help Cambodia deal with the Covid pandemic.
Yet he remained an enigmatic figure, staying out of the limelight, making few public statements.
""Everyone I've spoken to who's worked with him directly, been in the room with him, they all describe him as very courteous, very calm, very measured,"" says Jack Adamovic Davies, a journalist who did a three year-long investigation of Chen Zhi which was published by Radio Free Asia last year.
""I think not being the kind of flamboyant person that people will write tabloid-y things about was smart. Even those who no longer want to be associated with him are still impressed by his quiet charisma, his gravitas.""
But where was all this wealth and power coming from?
In 2019 the property bubble burst in Sihanoukville. The online gambling business had attracted Chinese criminal syndicates, who then began violent turf wars with each other. Tourists were scared off.
Under pressure from China, then-prime minister Hun Sen banned online gambling in August that year. Around 450,000 Chinese left the city as its main business collapsed. Many of Prince Group's residential blocks were left empty.
Yet Chen Zhi continued to expand his business interests and spend freely.
According to the UK authorities, in 2019 he bought a £12m mansion in north London and a £95m office block in the city's financial district. The US says he and his associates bought properties in New York, private jets and superyachts, and a Picasso painting.
And, they allege, Chen Zhi's wealth came from the most profitable business in Asia today, online fraud, and the human trafficking and money laundering that go with it.
The US and UK have imposed sanctions on 128 companies linked to Chen Zhi and Prince Group, and on 17 individuals from seven different nationalities who they allege helped run his scam empire. Assets linked to Chen Zhi in the US and UK have been frozen. 
The sanctions announcement describes an elaborate web of shell companies and cryptocurrency wallets through which money was moved to conceal its origins.
It says: ""Prince Group Transnational Crime Organisation profits from a litany of transnational crimes including sextortion - a type of fraud involving the solicitation for eventual blackmail of sexually explicit materials, often from minors - money laundering, various frauds and rackets, corruption, illegal online gambling, and the industrial-scale trafficking, torture, and extortion of enslaved workers in furtherance of the operation of at least 10 scam compounds in Cambodia.""
China too had been quietly investigating the Prince Group since at least 2020. There have been a number of court cases accusing the company of running online fraud schemes. 
The Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau has established a task force ""to investigate the ""Prince Group, a major transnational online gambling syndicate based in Cambodia"".
At its heart, the US and UK allege, were businesses like Golden Fortune Science and Technology Park, a compound built by the Prince Group in Chrey Thom, close to the Vietnamese border. 
In the past the Prince Group has denied any involvement in scams, and said it no longer has any connection to Golden Fortune, but the US and UK investigation argues that there is still a clear business link between them.
Mr Adamovic Davies interviewed a number of people living and working near Golden Fortune for his investigation into Chen Zhi. They described brutal beatings of the mainly Chinese, Vietnamese and Malaysians who tried to escape from the compound, where they were forced to run online scams.
""I think it's the sheer scale of his operations which really makes Chen Zhi stand out,"" he says, adding that it is shocking the Prince Group was able to build a ""global footprint"" without raising alarm bells given the serious criminal charges it now faces. 
""What should be uncomfortable for a lot of people is that Chen Zhi should never have been able to acquire all these assets, in Singapore, London or the US. Lawyers, accountants, real estate agents, bankers, all should have been looking at this group and saying, hang on, this doesn't add up. And they didn't.""
Today, after all the publicity generated by the US and UK sanctions, businesses are rushing to dissociate themselves from the Prince Group. 
The Cambodian Central Bank has had to issue a statement to nervous depositors assuring them they will be able to withdraw their funds from Prince Bank. The South Korean authorities have frozen $64m of its deposits held by Korean banks. 
The Singapore and Thai governments are promising investigations into Prince subsidiaries in their jurisdictions - of the 18 individuals targeted by the US and UK, three are Singaporeans.
Cambodia's government has said little, apart from urging the US and UK authorities to be sure they have sufficient evidence for their allegations. 
But it will be difficult for Cambodia's ruling elite to distance themselves from Chen Zhi, after being so close to him for so long. Cambodia was already facing growing pressure over its tolerance of scam businesses, which some estimate may account for around half of the entire economy.
And what of Chen Zhi himself?
Nothing has been heard or seen of him since the sanctions were announced last week. The enigmatic tycoon, once among the most powerful figures in Cambodia, appears to have vanished.
Immigrant doctors, many of them from India, are the lifeline of the US healthcare system, especially in rural areas.
Zhang Shengmin heads anti-corruption efforts in the army and is seen as a trusted loyalist of President Xi.
Authorities have issued a rare red wind warning, the highest alert level, for the capital Wellington.
Millions are forced to breathe toxic air, as authorities continue to point fingers at their political rivals for the crisis. 
Singapore has strict rules against protests and has effectively banned public gatherings related to the Israel-Gaza war.

58,2025-10-23,"Hong Suk-hui was waiting on the shore of South Korea's Jeju Island when the call came. His fishing boat had capsized.
Just two days earlier, the vessel had ventured out on what he had hoped would be a long and fruitful voyage. But as the winds grew stronger, its captain was ordered to turn back. On the way to port, a powerful wave struck from two directions creating a whirlpool, and the boat flipped. Five of the 10 crew members, who had been asleep in their cabins below deck, drowned.
""When I heard the news, I felt like the sky was falling,"" said Mr Hong.
Last year, 164 people were killed or went missing in accidents in the seas around South Korea – a 75% jump from the year before. Most were fishermen whose boats sunk or capsized.
""The weather has changed, it's getting windier every year,"" said Mr Hong, who also chairs the Jeju Fishing Boat Owners Association. 
""Whirlwinds pop up suddenly. We fisherman are convinced it is down to climate change.""
Alarmed by the spike in deaths, the South Korean government launched an investigation into the accidents.
This year, the head of the taskforce pinpointed climate change as one of the major causes, as well as highlighting other problems — the country's aging fishing workforce, a growing reliance on migrant workers, and poor safety training.
The seas around Korea are warming more rapidly than the global average, in part because they tend to be shallower. Between 1968 and 2024, the average surface temperature of the country's seas increased by 1.58C, more than double the global rise of 0.74C.
Warming waters are contributing to extreme weather at sea, creating the conditions for tropical storms, like typhoons, to become more intense.
They are also causing some fish species around South Korea to migrate, according to the country's National Institute of Fisheries Science, forcing fisherman to travel further and take greater risks to catch enough to make a living.
Environmental campaigners say urgent action is needed to ""stop the tragedy occurring in Korean waters"".
On a rainy June morning, Jeju Island's main harbour was crammed with fishing boats. The crews hurried back and forth between sea and land, refuelling and stocking up for their next voyage, while the boats' owners paced anxiously along the dock watching the final preparations.
""I'm always afraid something might happen to the boat, the risks have increased so much,"" said 54-year-old owner, Kim Seung-hwan. ""The winds have become more unpredictable and extremely dangerous.""
A few years ago, Mr Kim began to notice that the popular silvery hairtail fish he relied on were disappearing from local waters, and his earnings plunged by half.
Now his crews have to journey into deeper, more perilous waters to find them, sometimes sailing as far south as Taiwan.
""Since we're operating farther away, it's not always possible to return quickly when there's a storm warning,"" he said. ""If we stayed closer to shore it would be safer, but to make a living we have to go farther out.""
Professor Gug Seung-gi led the investigation into the recent accidents, which found that South Korea's seas appear to have become more dangerous. It noted the number of marine weather warnings around the Korean Peninsula - alerting fishermen to gales, storm surges, and typhoons - increased by 65% between 2020 and 2024.
""Unpredictable weather is leading to more boats capsizing, especially small fishing vessels that are going further out and are not built for such long, rough trips,"" he told the BBC.
Professor Kim Baek-min, a climate scientist at South Korea's Pukyong National University, said that although climate change was creating the conditions to make strong, sudden wind gusts more likely, a clear trend had not yet been established – for that, more research and long-term data is needed.
One foggy morning, we left shore in the dark on a small trawler with Captain Park Hyung-il, who has been fishing anchovies off Korea's south coast for more than 25 years. He sang sea shanties, determined to stay upbeat. But when we reached the nets he had left out overnight, his mood crumpled.
As he wound them in, the anchovies could barely be seen among the hordes of jellyfish and other fodder. Once the anchovies had been separated out, they filled just two boxes.
""In the past, we'd fill 50 to 100 of these baskets in a single day,"" he said. ""But this year the anchovies have vanished and we're catching more jellyfish than fish.""
This is the predicament facing tens of thousands of fishermen along South Korea's coastlines. Over the past 10 years, the amount of squid caught in South Korean waters each year has plummeted 92%, while anchovy catches have fallen by 46%.
Even the anchovies Park had caught were not fit for market, he said, and would need to be sold as animal-feed.
""The haul is basically worthless,"" he sighed, explaining it would barely cover the day's fuel costs, let alone his crew's wages.
""The sea is a mess, nothing makes sense anymore,"" Park continued. ""I used to love this job. There was joy knowing that someone, somewhere in the country was eating the fish I caught. But now, with barely anything to catch, that sense of pride is fading.""
And, with livelihoods disappearing, young people no longer want to join the industry. In 2023 almost half of South Korea's fishermen were over the age of 65, up from less than a third a decade earlier.
Increasingly, elderly captains must rely on help from migrant workers from Vietnam and Indonesia. Often these workers do not receive sufficient safety training, and language barriers mean they cannot communicate with the captains – further compounding the dangers.
Woojin Chung, a researcher at the Environmental Justice Foundation, a UK-based charity, described it as ""a vicious and tragic cycle"".
When you combine more extreme weather with the pressure to travel further, the increased fuel costs this brings, and the need to rely on cheap, untrained foreign labour, ""you have a higher chance of meeting disaster"", she explained.
On 9 February this year, a large shipping trawler sank suddenly near the coastal city of Busan, killing 10 of the crew. It was a bitterly cold, windy day, and smaller boats had been banned from going out, but this trawler was deemed sturdy enough to withstand the gales. The reason it went down is still a mystery.
One of those killed was 63-year-old Young-mook. A fisherman for 40 years, he had been planning to retire, but that morning someone called and asked him to fill a last-minute opening on the boat.
""It was so cold that once you fell in you wouldn't survive the hypothermia, especially at his age,"" said his daughter Ean, still distraught over his death.
Ean thinks it has become too easy for boat owners to blame climate change for accidents. Even in cases where bad weather plays a role, she believes it is still the owners' responsibility to assess the risks and keep their crew safe. ""Ultimately it is their call when to go out,"" she said.
As a child, she remembers her father's fridge would be filled with crabs and squid. ""Now the stocks are gone, but the companies still force them to go out, and because these men have worked as fishermen their whole lives, they don't have alternative job options, so they keep fishing even when they're too frail to do so,"" she said.
Ean also wants owners to better maintain their boats, which are aging too. ""Companies have insurance, so they get compensated after a boat sinks, but our loved ones can't be replaced.""
The authorities, aware they cannot control the weather, are now working with fishermen to make their boats safer. As we were with Mr Hong, whose boat capsized earlier this year, a team of government inspectors arrived to carry out a series of on-the-spot checks on two of his other vessels.
The government's taskforce is recommending that boats be fitted with safety ladders, fisherman be required to wear life jackets, and that safety training be mandatory for all foreign crew. It also wants to improve search and rescue operations, and for fisherman to have access to more localised and real-time weather updates.
Some regions are even offering to pay fishermen for the jellyfish they catch, to try to clean up the seas, while squid fishermen are being given loans to protect them from bankruptcy, and encourage them to retire.
Because the problem will likely worsen. The UN's Food and Agricultural Organisation forecasts that total fish catches in South Korea will decline by almost a third by the end of this century, if carbon emissions and global warming continue on their current trajectories.
""The future looks very bleak,"" said the anchovy fisherman Captain Park, now in his late 40s. He recently started a YouTube channel documenting his catches in the hope of earning some extra money. Park is the third generation of his family to do this work and likely the last.
""Back then it felt romantic getting up early and heading out to sea. There was a sense of adventure and reward.""
""These days it's just really tough.""

Beyond Meat, the latest meme stock, fell in premarket trading on Thursday, after surging through the week and paring in Wednesday's trading.
The plant-based food company, known for its vegan burgers, was down nearly 20% to $2.89 a share at 7.53 a.m. ET, after the stock soared 112% in Wednesday's trading, reaching a high of over $7 — a 1,000% rise in four days — before closing at $3.58.
Appetite for Beyond Meat began to grow last week when Dubai-based trader Dimitri Semenikhin posted on Monday that he had bought 4% of the shares outstanding and released a video explaining his enthusiasm for the stock.
The trader, who goes under the moniker ""Capybara Stocks,"" said in the video that the company's ""bullish"" move of selling stock for nearly $3 to repay its debt removed ""its previously high risk of bankruptcy"" and ""greatly"" strengthened its balance sheet.
In a Thursday note about Beyond Meat and fellow meme stock Krispy Kreme, AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould wrote, ""Quite what plan the buyers of Beyond Meat and Krispy Kreme have remains to be seen, although long-term, efficient allocation of capital does not necessarily seem to feature.
""That may be of no concern to those who are confident that there are quick profits to be had, but previous efforts to squeeze short sellers in this stock ultimately failed and it is hard to push around the price of a security or asset on a sustained basis.""

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with bakery owner Rebecca Coffin. It has been edited for length and clarity.
I am interested in feeding people. It's what I've done my whole life. 
My first job was bussing tables, and then I ended up traveling around the US as a young woman, working in restaurants and learning my craft. 
I then came back to Maine and started a family. And now I get to help my community with the business I started with my son. 
My son was struggling in school and had a lot of anxiety. I ended up pulling him out and homeschooling him. We were learning fractions, so I began baking with him. And then, we needed to learn hands-on things like how to manage finances and count money, so we started bringing baked goods to farmers' markets. In 2017, we began Hailey's Kitchen in Windham.
We primarily stock baked goods, including orders for pies, birthday cakes, and wedding cakes. We also offer a variety of food options, such as sandwiches, soups, avocado toast, bagels, smoothies, and frappes — a plethora of amazing things.
I post on Facebook every day for my business, sharing our rotating menu so our followers will know what we are serving that day. I went to post, and I saw a post from the local CBS affiliate WGME that talked about the loss of SNAP benefits due to the government shutdown.
I thought, ""How many people are going to be affected by this in our immediate community?"" Our food banks are already stretched, and people are struggling. I thought, ""I have a restaurant, I cook, and I feed people, so that's what we're going to do.""
I posted that if anyone you know needs a meal, please come to Hailey's. It was reposted in at least five Facebook groups within 24 hours.
I began to have anxiety as I started to think about how much food this could be, but I didn't need to worry. My phone has been blowing up with people asking to help, and I'm so happy it's paying off. 
We've already had large monetary donations. A woman called me from Pennsylvania, and a woman drove here from Massachusetts to meet us and give us money. An older couple, a woman placing a Thanksgiving pie order, and people coming in to buy their breakfast sandwich — they've all given financial support. 
The community has rallied around us to help support our neighbors. I was prepared to take a financial loss to pay for the meals, but I haven't had to.
Here's how it works: We put a sticky note on the wall that says ""free meal"" or ""free coffee,"" which someone can bring to the register. We're trying to come up with a better system, but we've had people use it already. I'm so happy we have so many to give. I don't care if your SNAP benefits aren't coming, or if you don't have access to food — I'll give anyone a meal, I'll do anything to help.
This week, I helped a woman who has been living in a hotel with her two children for almost a year, working over 60 hours a week, trying to make it work. She will finally move into a new apartment in a few weeks, but she just needed a little support for food because she's so stretched financially right now. We bought her groceries. If someone needs a winter coat, I hope they come here and ask because I'll make sure they get one.
It's not political. Feeding people is just humanity. My values are not to let people starve and go hungry. I'm 100% on board with making sure that people get their needs met in any way.

It’s easy to forget that Apple does not have the market cornered on the all-in-one desktop setups, despite their 40-year history of desktop dominance. There are some pretty sweet all-in-ones on the Windows side of the fence too, with this 21.5-inch HP model among the very best. It’s about to get even better, because thanks to this hot limited-time Amazon deal, the HP All in One is half the price of the current iMac â just $646.Â 
At 21.5 inches, the HP is slightly smaller than the 24-inch iMac, but this model that’s on sale at Amazon has a 1TB SSD and 32GB of RAM â twice the RAM and four times the storage capacity of Apple’s entry-level iMac, which is currently a $1,300 machine. In fact, to get an iMac with as much RAM and storage as this HP, your price suddenly goes up by a cool grand to $2,300.
See at Amazon
As convenience goes, you can’t beat an all-in-one setup with big FHD monitor, keyboard, and mouse all included. The HP All in One is bundled with an accessories package to further narrow your shopping list, with a 7-in-1 USB hub, mouse, 128GB USB thumb drive, and Windows 11 Professional included. The only thing you need to add to this package is you and all of your computing needs, whether they be for work or play.
The Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.3 connections, paired with the built-in HP True Vision HD camera, are the perfect combination for video calls and conferencing. The big 21.5-inch display has anti-glare treatment to reduce eye strain, which you’ll definitely put to the test when you use that big screen and fast internet connection to turn the HP All in One into a top-notch streaming device.
As much as you’ll love the cord-free nature of an all-in-one desktop, there are plenty of options built into the HP All in One for expansion or other devices. There are four USB-A ports at the back of the monitor â two with 5Gbps data transfer speed, and a USB-C port that also moves data at up to 5Gbps. An HDMI-out port and RJ-45 Ethernet port complete the package.
Dare we say the HP All in One that’s currently on sale at Amazon for just $646 is even better than the iMac, and at less than half the price while this limited-time 71% deal is in place? We might not stick out our neck that far, but it’s absolutely in the same league as the iMac, and don’t forget the larger RAM and storage capacities that the HP comes with. This might be the best one-stop shopping tech deal you see all year.

The rivalry between Samsung and Apple extends far beyond smartphones, and nowhere is this more apparent than in the premium… earbuds market. Apple just launched the AirPods Pro 3 a few weeks ago, but Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, despite being a few months older, pack even more powerful (AI) features under the hood.
Right now, Amazon has slashed these pro-level earbuds from $249 down to $189, an all-time low that makes Apple’s pricing look almost unreasonable. If you’ve been tired of dealing with mediocre sound quality on crowded commutes or struggling to hear your calls clearly in noisy environments, these earbuds solve those exact frustrations.
See at Amazon
Samsung has redone the fit and comfort formula with the Buds 3 Pro, and abandoned that classic in-ear rubber tip form that lots of us find uncomfortable after a long period of wear. Instead, it uses a new ergonomic form that holds pressure more evenly across your ear so you’re able to wear these for extended periods of time on long flights, work marathons or at the gym without that pesky pain that causes you to reach for relief.
The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro’s active noise cancellation works on a different plane than budget models and actually holds its own with Apple’s. Samsung uses adaptive ANC tech that’s always scanning your world and tweaking cancellation power in real time. What this means in practical terms is that the earbuds automatically understand that you transitioned from a quiet office to a noisy street and turn up the cancellation. It’s a profound difference: plane engine hum vanishes, subway roaring dissipates, and that noisy coworker’s keyboard typing is barely a nuisance.
The sound-optimizing feature uses AI to analyze what you’re listening to and shifts equalizer settings automatically : If you switch from a podcast to a bass-heavy hip-hop beat, your earbuds sense this move and shift audio profile dynamically. This happens transparently in the background so you get studio-quality sound on every kind of content without having to manually shift settings via an app.
Call quality has been wireless earbuds’ Achilles’ heel, but the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro remediate this with a high-end three-microphone system on each bud. They work in conjunction with AI-driven voice processing to separate your voice from ambient noises. On video or phone calls, others at the receiving end will hear you distinctly even if you’re strolling on a windy street or at a coffee shop. The wind cancelling algorithm identifies that pesky whooshing sound that always compromises outside calls, making these buds truly useful for individuals who work from home or receive calls on foot.
Battery life comes in at approximately six hours with ANC active, with a further 24 hours of juice contained in a charged case. There’s a rapid charge facility that delivers an hour of listening time from a mere five minutes in the case, which comes in useful on hurried mornings which you had planned to charge overnight. Support for wireless charging allows you to plonk the case on any Qi-enabled pad which adds a convenient touch to your day.
This special Amazon exclusive release comes with a two-year extended warranty instead of a typical warranty of one year. With a price tag of just $189, which is below that of most mid-range pairs that cannot compete with such powerful noise cancellation, sound, or intelligent features, it really is almost ridiculous that they undercut AirPods Pro 3 by such an amount.

Kirby Air RidersMasahiro SakuraiNintendo 
Even in a packed year for kart racers, Kirby Air Riders is playing for keeps. Will it earn a place alongside Mario Kart World and Sonic Racing: Crossworlds? Director Masahiro Sakurai hopes so. The legendary developer said he doesn’t plan on continuing the series; the upcoming Switch 2 exclusive is a one-and-done. “I’ve thrown everything I have into this game,” he said during its latest livestream preview. He certainly has. Just when you thought you knew everything Kirby Air Riders has to offer, Sakurai announces even more modes, characters, and features, including a roguelike adventure called Road Trip.
In a second hour-long Direct-style presentation for Kirby Air Riders that went live on Thursday, the famed Smash Bros. Ultimate director reminded fans why he’s the king of content maximalism. If you thought Nintendo’s latest racing game, out November 20, would be just a racing game with a sandbox mode, you would be sorely mistaken, my pink, puffy friend. Some are already calling it the “Kirby game of all Kirby games.”
Sorry to break the order of my reporting of the Kirby Air Riders Direct, but I needed to share Sakurai's closing speech because what a guy! He is a masterclass in game development. pic.twitter.com/ngXoBgcj4X
— KÄbÄ« (@KirPinkFury) October 23, 2025

This is far from the full list of newly revealed features players will get to mess around with:
Like I said, this is an incomplete and abridged rundown of all of the gameplay elements Sakurai dove into during the latest and likely final preview of Kirby Air Riders ahead of release. He also mentioned how players will earn miles by playing that are spent to unlock more parts of the Machine Market to outfit your ride. Plus there are new collectibles called Gummies. They sound a bit like the stickers from Smash Bros. Ultimate. “Who knows, maybe youâll become a Gummillionaire!” Nintendo’s words, not mine.
But wait, there’s still more! Kibry Air Riders is also getting dedicated amiibo figures. There are three, all launching next year starting on March 5 with Meta Knight & Shadow Star, followed later on by King Dedede & Tank Star and Chef Kawasaki & Hop Star. Like the new amiibo Nintendo’s been rolling out, these are bigger, more complex, and will likely have those bigger $30 price tags to matchÂ (JK: they’re actually $50 each). Has Nintendo given Sakurai a blank check to do whatever he wants with Kirby Air Riders before he makes the next Smash Bros.? Probably.
We’ll see how it all adds up in practice, but on paper at least, the game is certainly shaping up to satiate even the most ravenous fans’ demands in a way the somewhat content-lite Mario Kart World maybe didn’t when it debuted back over the summer. “Just so you know, we’re not planning DLC, everything is here,” Sakurai said of Kirby Air Riders. Ouch! Switch Online subscribers can try the game for free during Global Test Ride events on Nov. 8-9 and Nov. 15-16.

Oracle stock (NYSE: ORCL) recently dropped 10% in a week, a decline attributed to investor concern over the high costs and potential margin pressure from its aggressive expansion into the AI cloud infrastructure business. Despite this volatility, Oracle, along with Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), directly competes with Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) in the Application Software sector. 
A comparative analysis reveals a notable divergence:
That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like ORCL, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
OpInc = Operating Income, P/OpInc = Price To Operating Income Ratio
Do these statistics provide the complete picture? Check Buy or Sell SNPS Stock to determine if Synopsys maintains an advantage that stands up to scrutiny. For context, Synopsys (SNPS) offers electronic design automation software and intellectual property solutions for integrated circuits, facilitating USB, PCI Express, DDR, Ethernet, SATA, MIPI, HDMI, and Bluetooth low energy technologies.
This is merely one method to assess investments. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio considers numerous additional factors and is structured to minimize stock-specific risks while providing potential upside.
One approach to analyze whether Synopsys stock is currently overpriced relative to other companies is to compare these metrics with what they were a year ago. Notably, if there has been a significant reversal in Synopsys’s trends in the past 12 months, then the current discrepancy is likely to correct itself. Alternatively, sustained underperformance in terms of revenue and operating income growth for Synopsys would strengthen the notion that the stock is overpriced in relation to its competitors and might not adjust soon.
Investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics."

As the government shutdown stretches on, my work to find hidden opportunities in an overvalued market forges on as always.
Liquified natural gas (LNG) has commanded the spotlight in the energy sector for the last few years, and investors could easily think there are no opportunities left to ride the ongoing LNG boom.
I disagree and have a stock idea for you: an LNG company that remains undervalued, even as powerful tailwinds continue to support industry growth.
My firm’s Robo-Analyst AI Agent allows me to scour the entire market and shine lights in all the dark corners. Put simply, my technology gives you an edge when looking for good stocks in every kind of market.
Liquefied natural gas (LNG) continues to play a critical role in meeting rising global energy demand and is a cornerstone of the clean energy transition.
Despite being one of the largest LNG producers in the world and holding long-term contracts that secure future cash flows, this company’s stock trades at a significant discount. Cheniere Energy (LNG) is this week’s Long Idea.
With rising populations, increasing industrialization, and technological advancements, such as the expansion of energy-hungry data centers, we’re not surprised to see that McKinsey forecasts global energy demand to rise from just above 600 million terajoules (TJ) in 2023 to nearly 700 million TJ in 2050.
At the same time, leaders around the world aim to meet rising demand with cleaner energy sources. However, the complete transition from fossil fuels to clean renewable energy will take much longer than expected.
Case in point, the global renewables (includes solar, wind, hydro, nuclear, and other renewables) energy generation increased by just 858 terawatt hours (TWh), or just over 3 million TJ YoY in 2024, a drop (0.005%) in the bucket compared to the 600 million terajoules (TJ) of energy demand in 2023.  
The bottom line is that renewable energy growth is struggling to keep up with demand growth and is not a threat to take much market share from fossil fuels anytime soon. As a result, demand for cleaner fossil fuels like natural gas and, particularly, liquefied natural gas (LNG) will continue to boom.
LNG produces 40% less carbon dioxide (CO2) than coal and 30% less than oil, which makes it the cleanest source among fossil fuels. Beyond LNG’s emission advantages, it is also a much more reliable and stable energy source compared to renewables such as solar and wind.
The rise in LNG demand is fueled by several underlying factors that will drive growth for many years to come.
Countries in Asia are rapidly expanding their regasification (the process of turning LNG back into gas for power generation) capacity and downstream distribution infrastructure. Shell (SHEL) forecasts regasification capacity in Asia will increase from just over 600 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) in 2024 to around 800 MTPA in 2030. See Figure 1.
Figure 1: LNG Regasification Capacity in Asia: 2020 – 2030
Shell further forecasts more than 180 million additional people are expected to gain access to the gas grid in China and India from 2020 to 2030. The percentage of the population (China and India combined) connected to the gas grid would then increase from ~20% to 30% over the same time.
Gastech forecasts that Asia will drive more than 70% of the new global LNG demand through 2040, specifically:
Europe, and to a lesser extent, Japan, must address the large gap between renewable energy goals and actual renewable energy supply.
In Europe, the difference between the REPowerEU policy goals and industry forecasts for 2030 show significant shortages per Figure 2.
Figure 2: Europe Power Policy Goals and Industry Forecasts in 2030
*GW = gigawatts
In Japan, there’s similar differences between the 2030 6th Energy Plan policy goals and industry forecasts:
Historically, both countries depend on LNG to meet their remaining energy needs. Figure 3 shows the gap between power demand and power supply in both Japan and Europe through 2030, a gap that I expect will continue to be filled with LNG.
Figure 3: Power Supply Gap Forecast for Europe and Japan Through 2030
Sectors such as shipping and heavy-duty road transport, where electrification is technically or economically challenging, are increasingly turning to LNG as a more cost-effective fuel. Marine vessels and heavy-duty trucks equipped with LNG engines can use the fuel directly without regasification, which makes LNG a cleaner and more efficient alternative to other fuel types such as diesel.
Shell projects that the LNG marine order book will nearly double from ~1,200 vessels in 2024 to just over ~2,000 vessels in 2029. Additionally, Shell forecasts LNG demand in the shipping industry to quadruple from 4 MTPA in 2024 to 16 MTPA in 2030.
Shell also forecasts that the number of LNG-fueled heavy-duty trucks in China and India will increase from just under 1 million trucks in 2024 to around 1.3 million trucks in 2030. Fueling 1.3 million trucks would require about 30 MPTA of LNG, an increase of 36% from the 22 MTPA of LNG consumed in 2024.
In my recent report on Black Stone Minerals (BSM), I highlighted how the growing number of data centers will fuel higher natural gas demand. In September 2025, estimates provided during the LDC Gas Forums indicate data center gas usage will rise to 4-8 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) by 2030, up from 1Bcf/d.
While LNG may not directly power data centers, as it needs to be regassed to generate electricity, the rising regasification capacity across the globe should help drive further demand for LNG. Shell estimates that data centers in Japan, South Korea, Thailand, and Singapore alone could account for 2-7 MTPA of gas demand by 2030, which would represent between 2-5% of global LNG imports.
LNG can also power cooling for data centers, which further drives demand from this industry. During the regasification process, LNG absorbs heat as it returns to its gaseous state, which releases large amounts of ‘cold energy’ that is typically dissipated into seawater or other reheating systems. A new approach aims to capture and repurpose this cold energy to provide cooling for data centers and other high-density digital infrastructure. China is using this cooling technology in its LNG intelligent computing center, and Thailand and South Korea are exploring the technology as well.
As with any commodity/raw material, oversupply can quickly drop prices, reduce operator profitability, and eliminate the feasibility of many capital-intensive projects. With significant expansion capacity already under development, will demand continue to outpace supply?
Gastech estimates there is currently more than 200 MTPA of liquefication capacity under development across the globe. If all projects were to achieve full commission and be completed on time, the LNG liquefication capacity could potentially reach 700 MTPA by 2030. For reference, Gastech expects global LNG demand to grow to 650-700 Mt by 2040.
However, given rising capital costs, construction delays, regulatory hurdles, and environmental concerns, Gastech notes that “supply realisation is highly unlikely”.
Instead, Gastech outlines the more realistic scenario, named “selective growth”, where low-cost projects get completed. In this scenario, global LNG capacity would increase between 120 and 150 MTPA, which would roughly align supply and demand through 2030. In this case, LNG prices would stabilize and remain at current levels.
While Gastech provides a scenario in which supply and demand largely equal one another, Shell forecasts that even more investment is necessary to ensure supply keeps up with demand. Shell’s LNG Outlook 2025 report projects LNG demand to exceed supply between 2034–2040. See Figure 4.
Figure 4: LNG Supply and Demand Forecast Through 2040
The U.S. was once again the world’s largest LNG exporter in 2024, a position it first achieved in 2022. U.S. LNG exports have nearly quadrupled over the last five years. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts U.S. LNG exports will increase 36% from 2024 to 2026.
Shell forecasts that U.S. exports could potentially reach 180 MTPA by 2030 and account for a third of global supply by 2035. In this forecast, 2035 U.S. LNG export volumes are double the 2024 LNG demand of Japan and South Korea combined. By 2035, the U.S. and Qatar (the second largest LNG exporter) could account for ~60% of global LNG supply.
Cheniere Energy is the largest LNG producer in the U.S. and second largest LNG producer in the world. The company operates two of the three largest LNG export terminals in the U.S., including the Sabine Pass Plant (largest) and Corpus Christi Plant (third largest). These two plants have >30 MTPA and >18 MTPA total production capacity in operation as of August 2025, respectively.
Cheniere currently has a combined liquefication capacity of ~48 to ~50 MTPA, which equals just above 11% of the global liquefication capacity.
To meet future LNG demand, Cheniere Energy is currently expanding its Corpus Christi facility. The project, dubbed CCL3, will add around 12 MTPA of liquefication capacity by 2030. Upon completion, the company’s total liquefication capacity would reach roughly 60 – 63 MTPA. As of June 30, 2025, the CCL 3 project is ~87% complete.
Longer-term, Cheniere has already planned a Corpus Christie Stage 4 expansion and Sabine Pass Stage 5 expansion (both not yet under construction), which would add an additional 40+ MTPA and bring the company’s total liquefication capacity to around 100 MTPA.
Cheniere Energy’s business is largely insulated from spot price volatility due to the long-term nature of its contracts. These long-term sales purchase agreements (SPAs) provide stable, long-term cash flows.
Under the SPAs, customers are required to pay a fixed fee based on the contracted volume, regardless of whether the customer elects to cancel or suspend deliveries. On top of the fixed fee, the SPAs also have a variable fee, which is indexed to Henry Hub prices and structured to cover the cost of natural gas purchases, transportation, and liquefaction fuel consumed to produce LNG.
In its corporate update presentation in June 2025, Cheniere Energy noted that 95% of its capacity is already contracted through the mid 2030s, with a weighted average remaining life of long-term contracts of 16 years.
Through the contracts in place, the company has more than $120 billion in remaining fixed fee revenues through 2050.
Recently signed SPAs span the globe and include:
Importantly, Cheniere Energy’s LNG export presence in Asia is crucial, since majority of the global LNG demand will come from the region. Cheniere Energy’s relationships with China’s ENN and India’s GAIL could play a key role in acquiring new contracts in these countries.
Cheniere Energy also recently signed contracts that guarantee the company access to natural gas feedstock, including:
Cheniere Energy’s top- and bottom-line have improved significantly since the company transitioned to a pure play LNG company in 2016.
Cheniere Energy has grown revenue and net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) by 37% and 70% compounded annually since 2016, respectively. See Figure 5. More recently, the company has grown revenue and NOPAT 12% and 18% compounded annually since 2019.
The company’s NOPAT margin improved from 5% in 2016 to 31% in the TTM, while its invested capital turns rose from 0.1 to 0.4 over the same time. Rising NOPAT margins and invested capital turns drive the company’s return on invested capital (ROIC) from 0% in 2016 to 14% in the TTM.
Figure 5: Cheniere Energy’s Revenue and NOPAT Since 2016
Cheniere Energy not only the largest LNG producer in the U.S. and second largest in the world, but it is also more profitable than its oil & gas peers.
Cheniere Energy has the highest NOPAT margin and ROIC among the companies listed in its peer group in its proxy statement, which include EOG Resources (EOG), Targa Resources (TRGP), ConocoPhillips (COP), Baker Hughes (BKR), Phillips 66 (PSX), and more. See Figure 6.
Steady revenue from long-term contracts, coupled with prudent investment and capital expenditures create a highly profitable business. Cheniere can deploy these profits back into the business to fund expansion and thereby build on its existing scale advantages.
Figure 6: Cheniere Energy’s Profitability Vs. Peers: Trailing Twelve Months (TTM)
Cheniere Energy increased its quarterly dividend from $0.33/share in 3Q21 to $0.50/share in 3Q25. The company paid $1.5 billion (3% of market cap) in cumulative dividends since 2021. The company’s current dividend, when annualized, provides a 0.8% yield.
Cheniere Energy also returns capital to shareholders through share repurchases. The company repurchased a total of $5.8 billion (11% of market cap) of shares since 2021. As of June 30, 2025, the company has $3.2 billion remaining under its current share repurchase authorization, which is effective through December 31, 2027. If the company were to repurchase shares at TTM rates, it would repurchase $1.3 billion shares over the next year, which would provide a yield of 2.4%.
When combined, the dividend and share repurchase yield could reach 3.2%.
Since 2021, Cheniere Energy has generated a cumulative $13.9 billion (16% of its enterprise value) in free cash flow (FCF), which is more than enough to cover its $7.3 billion in combined dividend payments ($1.5 billion) and share repurchases ($5.8 billion).
Figure 7: Cheniere Energy’s Cumulative FCF: 2021 – 2Q25
Cheniere has also meaningfully reduced its shares outstanding from 256 million in 2019 to 224 million in 2Q25. See Figure 8.
I like companies that choose to return capital to shareholders instead of spending it on costly acquisitions or executive bonuses that rarely drive shareholder value creation. Companies that sport strong enough cash flows to consistently lower their shares outstanding, like Cheniere Energy, offer excellent value.
Figure 8: Cheniere’s Shares Outstanding: 2019 – 2Q25
Natural gas prices are likely to go up for multiple reasons:
Bears point out that higher natural gas prices could squeeze Cheniere Energy’s margins.
However, Cheniere Energy can offset the increase in gas prices with the SPAs’ variable fee, which is based on Henry Hub natural gas prices. Cheniere Energy notes in its 10-Q that “the structure of these contracts helps limit our exposure to fluctuations in U.S. natural gas prices.”
At its current price of $235/share, LNG has a price-to-economic book value (PEBV) ratio of 0.8. This ratio means the market expects the company’s profits to permanently fall 20% from current levels. This expectation seems overly pessimistic considering Cheniere Energy has:
Below, I use my reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model to analyze expectations for different stock valuation scenarios for LNG.
In the first scenario, I quantify the expectations baked in the current price. If I assume:
LNG would be worth $235/share today – equal to the current stock price. In this scenario, Cheniere Energy’s NOPAT would grow just 1% compounded annually from 2025 through 2034. For reference, LNG has grown NOPAT by 70% compounded annually since 2016 and 18% compounded annually since 2019. 
In this scenario, Cheniere Energy’s revenue would equal $30.4 billion. If Cheniere Energy continues to contract the same amount (95%) of its production capacity and generate the same amount of revenue per 1 MPTA of capacity as in the TTM, then $30.4 billion in revenue implies Cheniere Energy’s capacity would reach 80 MPTA in 2034, which is lower than the 100 MPTA capacity one can expect the company to reach if all planned projects are finished.
If I instead assume:
LNG would be worth at least $344/share today – a 46% upside to the current price. In this scenario, LNG’s NOPAT would grow just 3% compounded annually from 2025 through 2034.
Should Cheniere Energy grow profits near historical rates, the stock has even more upside. Figure 9 compares LNG’s historical NOPAT to the NOPAT implied in each of the above DCF scenarios.
Figure 9: Cheniere Energy’s Historical and Implied NOPAT: DCF Valuation Scenarios
Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings
Here’s a summary of why I think the moat around Cheniere Energy’s business will enable it to continue to generate higher NOPAT than the current market valuation implies:
These days, fewer investors focus on finding quality capital allocators with shareholder-aligned corporate governance. Due to the proliferation of noise traders, the focus is on short-term technical trading trends while more reliable fundamental research is overlooked. Here’s a quick summary of what noise traders are missing:
Cheniere Energy has beaten earnings estimates in 9 of the past 15 quarters, including in 2Q25. Year-to-date (YTD), LNG is up 10% and outperformed its benchmark, Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE), which is up 4%. Should Cheniere Energy beat earnings again it could send shares even higher.
Additionally, continued completion of its ongoing expansion projects, continued demand growth across the globe, and additional contract wins would provide profit growth opportunities and send shares higher.
Cheniere Energy’s executives receive cash awards based on annual incentives and stock awards based on long-term incentives. Annual incentives are based on EBITDA, budget management (adjusted SG&A expense), operational effectiveness (asset production etc.), ESG metrics, and strategic goals (expansion progress, etc.). Stock awards are based on the company’s adjusted EBITDA, absolute total shareholder return (TSR), and cumulative distributable cash flow per share.
I would prefer the company tie executive compensation to ROIC. Doing so ensures that executives’ interests are more aligned with shareholders’ interests as there is a strong correlation between improving ROIC and increasing shareholder value. Improving ROIC requires attention to all areas of the business, so including it in an executive compensation plan would incentivize executives to improve the entire business, not just one sales goal or earnings number.
Despite using EBITDA and TSR measures, Cheniere Energy’s management has grown economic earnings, the true cash flows of the business, 23% compounded annually since 2019.
Over the past twelve months, insiders have purchased 12,642 shares and sold 189,617 shares for a net effect of 202,259 shares sold. These sales represent <1% of shares outstanding.
There are currently 4.2 million shares sold short, which equates to 2% of shares outstanding and 3.75 days to cover.

Unionized Starbucks baristas plan to launch a national strike authorization vote on Friday, escalating a long-running labor conflict that has spilled beyond the coffee counters and into the boardroom.
The workers are fighting to ratify their first union contract. The latest efforts come about a month after a wave of sweeping store closures that left thousands of baristas out of work. Amid Starbucks' massive turnaround campaign, the company also faces new pressure from shareholders to address its increasingly contentious relationship with unionized employees.
""We are willing to do whatever it takes to get us toward that contract,"" Sabina Aguirre, a Starbucks barista at a unionized store in Columbus, Ohio, told Business Insider. ""We cannot continue to push through another year of stalled contract negotiations.""
The strike authorization vote, which would determine what could be the fourth barista work stoppage in two years, is set to run from October 24 through November 2. If authorized, the strike itself would be open-ended.
Seventy practice pickets and rallies are planned across 60 cities beginning next week to encourage union members to vote in favor of the strike, a spokesperson for the union, Starbucks Workers United, told Business Insider.
A Starbucks spokesperson told Business Insider that the company's commitment to bargaining with SBWU and reaching contract agreements ""has not changed.""
""Workers United chose to walk away from the negotiations, not Starbucks,"" the spokesperson said. ""If they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk.""
Contract talks collapsed in December. Starbucks corporate and the unionized workers have each blamed each other for the breakdown.
In addition to the authorization vote, the union took other action this week. On Tuesday, it filed a formal complaint with the International Olympic Committee opposing Starbucks' role as the official coffee partner of the 2028 Olympics and Paralympics in Los Angeles. The union cited unfair labor practice charges.
The Starbucks spokesperson told Business Insider the union's allegations of mistreatment in the IOC complaint ""have all previously been debunked and are without merit.""
According to the Economic Policy Institute, Starbucks had faced hundreds of unfair labor practice charges from the National Labor Relations Board as of early 2025, including accusations of retaliation and union-busting. The board is closed due to the government shutdown and did not respond to a request for comment.
SBWU, which first unionized in 2021, says it represents more than 12,000 baristas across more than 600 locations. However, after Starbucks shuttered hundreds of US stores identified as low-performing in late September, the Starbucks spokesperson said the union represents closer to 550, or less than 5% of its company-owned stores.
As of July, Starbucks reported it had 17,230 stores in the US and 18,842 stores in North America. Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol said the closures, offset by planned openings, would reduce the total to about 18,300 stores in North America by the end of the fiscal year.
The authorization vote is coming a week after a group of shareholders published an open letter to the company's board, urging Starbucks to resume contract talks.
The letter, sent on October 16, underscores growing pressure on the company to mend relations with its workforce. It was signed by Trillium Asset Management, Shareholder Association for Research and Education (SHARE), Pensions Investment Research Consultants (PIRC) on behalf of investor clients, and New York City Comptroller Brad Lander.
Representatives for PIRC did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.
Trillium, an activist investment firm holding over 119,000 shares of Starbucks stock, has repeatedly urged Starbucks to reach ""fair and timely"" collective bargaining agreements with its unionized workers since contract negotiations began in 2021. Jonas Kron, Trillium's chief advocacy officer, told Business Insider that Niccol, the CEO, seemed ""committed to the unionization process"" when he joined the company in September 2024.
""Now, just starting to see increasing amounts of unionization activity does not suggest that things are going well,"" Kron said.
A Starbucks spokesperson told Business Insider the company responded to Trillium with appreciation for their support as a long-term shareholder and ""clarification"" about how contract talks ended in December.
Michael Garland, assistant comptroller for corporate governance and responsible investment in New York City, told Business Insider that the city's comptroller office has been in discussions with Starbucks about its labor relations for years.
""The lack of progress is frustrating,"" Garland said.
The October letter is not the first time shareholders have expressed concern over Starbucks' labor relations. In 2023, Trillium, the New York Comptroller's Office, and SHARE were among the proponents of a proposal for the company to conduct an independent, third-party assessment of its labor practices. It passed with the support of 52% of shareholders.
Given the scale of Starbucks' footprint across the US, the unionization effort has been slow-going since the first store voted to unionize in Buffalo, New York, in December 2021. Starbucks said in 2023 it was committed to reaching labor agreements by the end of 2024.
Workers have participated in demonstrations and work stoppages in the years since, including three prior strikes.
The first was a daylong strike in November 2023. Baristas walked out during ""Red Cup Day,"" a typically busy day in stores when customers are offered a free reusable cup with the purchase of a beverage. A four-day strike followed in December 2024 that affected more than 300 locations nationwide. Another daylong strike in May 2025 included walkouts at more than 50 locations, as baristas protested the company's new dress code.
A Starbucks spokesperson told Business Insider that the union's previous ""attempts at disruption"" affected less than 1% of the company's store locations.
Tensions have increased under Niccol's tenure, though, including among corporate employees who Business Insider previously reported have launched in-office demonstrations against the company's return-to-office policy. If authorized, the barista strike would be the third work stoppage since Niccol took the helm.
While the earlier barista strikes were approved on a store-by-store basis, the union is now calling for a national strike authorization vote.
""Starbucks knows where we stand,"" said Michelle Eisen, a union spokesperson and a barista of 15 years, in a statement about the strike. ""They know our demands: more take-home pay, better hours, resolving legal issues. It's time to finalize a contract this fall before the all-important holiday season.""

Beyond Meat may be plant-based, but investors are beefing up their holdings as the company’s stock becomes a so-called meme asset.
Shares of the firm have surged over 1,000% since hitting a record intraday low last week, as the company announced its creditors had accepted a debt swap. Demand for Beyond Meat and other plant-based meat brands has softened despite initial popularity, with the company quickly becoming a penny stock after trading at around $230 during its 2019 peak.
It’s the latest to be caught up in the meme stock frenzy, like Opendoor, and of course GameStop.
Despite spending billions to ramp up its AI efforts, Meta said in an internal memo that it would lay off about 600 staffers at its Superintelligence Labs. Meta’s AI chief Alexandr Wang, cofounder of the firm Scale AI, characterized the layoffs as a restructuring move.
Uber is incentivizing drivers in select states with a $4,000 rebate program to switch to electric vehicles for use in the company’s “Uber Electric” service. The move comes as the Trump Administration sunsetted federal tax credits for EVs, and could help spur EV demand in the final quarter.
Tesla fell short of expectations in its third-quarter earnings report Wednesday, despite a historic rise in quarterly deliveries in the lead-up to the expiration of the EV tax credits. The automaker’s stock dropped more than 3% in pre-market trading this morning, though the firm actually reported revenues well above Wall Street’s predictions.

Global oil prices spiked early Thursday after the Trump Administration imposed a new set of sanctions targeting Russia’s two largest oil companies and threatened further action unless Moscow agreed to a ceasefire in its ongoing war with Ukraine.

First Lady Melania Trump’s $MELANIA memecoin is now under legal scrutiny, as a court filing this week alleges the cryptocurrency is part of a broader fraudulent “pump-and-dump” scheme meant to enrich a small number of insiders.

Women’s basketball is surging in popularity, so it makes sense that a number of the figures on Forbes’ 2025 list of America’s Most Powerful Women in Sports come from the sport. But all eyes are on the WNBA’s next contract negotiation, as its current collective bargaining agreement expires at the end of the month. As revenues hit record highs, WNBA players received just 9.3% of league income in 2022, according to Bloomberg—compared with roughly 50% for NBA players and 48% for the NFL.
General Motors vehicles will soon feature a self-driving “eyes-off” system, the company said Wednesday, though it will be limited to highway driving upon release. Human intervention will only be needed for things like off-ramps, and the system will be able to handle emergencies and sudden incidents, according to TechCrunch.
For the fourth year in a row, the NBA’s most valuable team is the Golden State Warriors, worth an estimated $11 billion.
No other NBA team was within $300 million of the Warriors’ estimated $880 million in revenue last season, with the club far outpacing the rest of the league with its income from sponsorships and premium seating, and ranking in the top three in virtually every category tracked by Forbes. In fact, Golden State more than doubled the $417 million league average for total revenue, and compared with the other North American sports leagues, the Warriors generated more cash than every franchise except the NFL’s Dallas Cowboys. But even for the rest of the NBA, business these days is very, very good.
According to Forbes estimates, league-wide revenue last season was up 10% year-over-year, to roughly $12.5 billion, including money from non-NBA events held at teams’ arenas but netting out arena debt service. And another significant jump is coming in 2025-26—the first season of the 11-year, $76 billion national media package the NBA signed last year with Disney, NBCUniversal and Amazon Prime Video.
With all of that cash pouring in, Forbes estimates that the 30 NBA teams are worth $5.4 billion on average—or just over $160 billion collectively—representing an increase of 21% over last year and more than doubling the average of $2.5 billion from just four seasons ago.
WHY IT MATTERS “The Celtics sold for a blended valuation of roughly $6.7 billion in August, and the Lakers are awaiting the NBA’s approval for a $10 billion transaction—figures that, given the franchises’ business performance in 2024-25, make them look more like fast-growing tech startups than sports teams in a nearly 80-year-old league,” says Forbes senior editor Brett Knight. “Forbes now values the 30 pro basketball teams at 12.9 times last season’s revenue on average, well ahead of the other major men’s leagues, which demonstrates just how desperate investors are to break into basketball. And no one is expecting that to change anytime soon.”

I’ve introduced GrapheneOS to a lot of friends and acquaintances, and I often see a mix of excitement and hesitation. Not because GrapheneOS doesn’t deliver on its promises, but because it practically requires you to buy Google’s Pixel line of smartphones to use it. For an open-source project so laser-focused on delivering a private Android experience, the dependency on Google feels paradoxical.
There are good reasons for this, of course — Google is the only major phone maker that’s generous enough to let you install alternative operating systems. But luckily, that might not be the case for much longer. After years of being limited to just one hardware platform, the team behind GrapheneOS has confirmed they’re working with a “major Android OEM” to bake in official support for the operating system.
While we don’t have many details yet, we’re clearly on the cusp of the ultimate GrapheneOS phone. So with that in mind, should you buy a Google Pixel 10 series phone now, or wait for what might be the first device to list GrapheneOS support on the spec sheet? Here’s what I think as a long-time GrapheneOS proponent and user.
If you’ve never heard of GrapheneOS, you might be wondering what’s so special about it and why so many people base their smartphone buying decision based on its compatibility. Simply put, it’s a security and privacy-hardened fork of Android. You can replace the stock Pixel OS on modern Google phones with GrapheneOS with surprisingly little effort, and the list of benefits are plenty.
You see, Android phone makers need to bundle Google’s entire Play Services suite as part of an agreement with the search giant if they wish to include the Play Store. This is why we see apps like Chrome and Google Photos pre-installed on a Motorola or Xiaomi phone, but it doesn’t stop at those apps. The Google Play Services framework has deep, system-level access to your device, giving it unfettered access to sensitive data like location, network activity, and app usage.
The solution might seem simple: just get rid of it. But unlike other privacy-oriented Android forks, GrapheneOS doesn’t make your phone any less usable or convenient by stripping away features. Instead, it isolates and restricts Google’s system-level components while granting you greater control over various Android permissions. This means you can still access the Play Store and even banking apps, while limiting them from phoning home with your data in the background.
You don’t just gain intangible privacy benefits. My favorite GrapheneOS feature is storage scopes, which let you grant apps access only to specific folders or files. It helped me realize just how excessive and broad Android’s default permissions really are. Other features include per-app network toggles, the ability to block sensor access, and an optional duress PIN. You can configure GrapheneOS to be as private as you’d like, but even the baseline experience is a step above what most Android phones ship with by default.
 Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority?
As I mentioned earlier, GrapheneOS’ compatibility list has been limited to Google’s Pixel line so far. And even though the latest Pixel 10 series isn’t supported yet, that will change within the next few months. However, it may also be the last Google device to get GrapheneOS, as the development team has stated that support for Pixel 11 and later hasn’t been decided yet.
Clearly then, the team’s focus is on the brand new vendor partnership that has now come to light. And based on what we’ve heard so far, it doesn’t seem to be a boutique or low-volume device either. The team says that they’re working with a major Android OEM on a future version of an existing smartphone and that it would be powered by a Snapdragon chip. GrapheneOS has a pretty long list of security requirements, so it rules out all but the flagship chip: the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5.
This is a very interesting point because Google’s latest Pixel 10 famously isn’t the fastest phone on the market — the Tensor G5 chip loses handily in benchmarks to flagship equivalents from Qualcomm and MediaTek. Many Pixel users are willing to overlook this in exchange for the software experiences built on the Tensor platform, but the latter doesn’t apply to GrapheneOS. In other words, GrapheneOS’ upcoming phone could unlock higher performance levels than what we’ll get from a Pixel in the near future.
Apart from that, we can make some educated guesses about GrapheneOS’ upcoming phone and how it might stack up to Google’s phones. It will likely cost at least as much as the base Pixel 10, given the flagship Snapdragon chip, and include similar internal specs. The partner brand in question might also be a smaller player in the space, given that Samsung hasn’t ever endorsed running alternative operating systems.
Having said that, the silver lining is that most Android brands have wider hardware distribution channels than Google. Since the Pixel is not available worldwide, those needing privacy the most (such as in oppressive regimes) are forced to import Pixel devices for GrapheneOS. Even smaller Android brands like Nothing have expanded rapidly, on the other hand, which could translate to greater accessibility.
But hardware is only half the story. While there are certainly benefits to leaving the Pixel platform behind, GrapheneOS users might lose out in some areas too. For one, the team has stated that the phone in question will likely only receive five years of software updates. Without the size and resources that Google and Samsung have at their disposal, competing Android phone makers haven’t made a seven-year update pledge yet.
Moreover, I’m personally concerned about camera quality. While SoC-level image processing has improved over the years, the Pixel relies heavily on Google’s computational photography to deliver its excellent results. This is currently easily achieved on GrapheneOS by installing the Google Camera app, but it remains to be seen if the stock camera app will be supported on the upcoming phone. Whenever I replaced Xiaomi’s Android skin with a custom ROM, I always had to contend with reduced image quality as a consequence of the stock camera app being unsupported.
You shouldn’t wait if you’re expecting GrapheneOS to be an out-of-the-box experience. The team has clearly stated that they aren’t building a privacy phone from the ground up. Instead, it’s simply working with a manufacturer to meet GrapheneOS’ strict security requirements on a mass market phone. This means you’ll still have to manually install the operating system like you would on a Pixel today.
The good news is that installing GrapheneOS on a Pixel takes just a few clicks today. More importantly, the project supports all Pixel devices for as long as Google still releases security updates. This means support going back to the Pixel 6 but also continued support for the Pixel 10 until it reaches Google’s end of support period, ending in 2032. Of course, things could change but the GrapheneOS team said that it intends to maintain support for all existing models.
So if you buy a Pixel 10 now, you’re guaranteed years of official GrapheneOS support, and the installation process is about as painless as it will ever get. On the other hand, the upcoming GrapheneOS phone is still at least a year away with the team estimating a launch window of late 2026 or early 2027. In light of that, I think it’s hard to argue against the kind of stability that the Pixel 10 offers when the alternative is still so unknown.

It sounds like a cliché, but I was recently asked about Nokia on the golf course. I had returned from a Nokia-sponsored analyst conference at the swank Biltmore Hotel in Phoenix, and a friend of mine was curious about what they were up to.  
“Are they still doing phones?” asked the friend, who is a retired wealth advisor. This might be a question that most people would ask, unaware that the company has been in the process of a long effort to diversify from telecom infrastructure. 
Nokia does, in fact, still sell phones. But it now has new growth in the best neighborhood: AI infrastructure. In its quarterly earnings announced early today in Europe, the Finnish company reported results reflecting 9% overall revenue growth and big gains in its renewed strategic focus on datacenter networking and AI infrastructure.
As proven by its recent earnings, Nokia has shown it can grow in new markets, including AI. Investors love that. Nokia’s stock vaulted 10% in U.S.-based trading today following the results. 
Nokia reported third-quarter profit ahead of market expectations on Thursday, driven by strong optical and cloud demand. This included growth in AI-focused datacenter sales following its acquisition of optical networking specialist Infinera. 
In announcing its results, Nokia management said artificial intelligence and cloud customers accounted for 6% of group net sales and 14% of network infrastructure sales, with optical networks up 19%. 
Some key takeaways:
With the news, Nokia shows that the turnaround architected by former Nokia CEO Pekka Lundmark is bearing fruit. Lundmark, frustrated by years of sluggish growth in telecom, saw the need to diversify by boosting products geared toward datacenter infrastructure. This also included a large acquisition of optical networking company Infinera for $2.3 billion, which was announced in 2024 and completed this year. 
In the quarter, the company showed impressive growth of 11% in network infrastructure, growing to €1.95 billion ($2.26 billion US). Cloud and Network Services surprised the street with sales of €645 million ($750 million US), 17% above estimates, according to Raymond James. Nokia now expects annual operating profit between 1.7 billion and 2.2 billion euros, a slight upgrade to the previous range of up to 2.1 billion.
Lundmark’s turnaround plan, which was described by himself as very difficult, now appears to be prescient. The company is finally emerging from under the long dark cloud of telecom, where for years it was weighed down by disappointing returns in the 5G infrastructure investment cycle. 
This year, ahead of the industry’s big Mobile World Congress trade conference in Barcelona, Lundmark handed the reigns over to an American, Justin Hotard, who brings a background in datacenter and enterprise. Hotard held previous executive roles at Intel, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and NCR Corporation.
“We have seen some improvements in CSP [communications service provider] expectations, along with the strong order intake I mentioned in AI and cloud,” said Hotard on the company earnings conference call. “In fact, entering the fourth quarter, our backlog coverage is stronger than in recent years. We’re also pleased with our progress on the Infinera acquisition.""
It’s possible that the telecom frustration was a blessing in disguise. Now, Nokia can sail into the land of rainbows and unicorns: AI. Nokia has now shown proof that a successful pivot is underway and it is now well-positioned with datacenter networking products, including its high-performance SR Linux-powered routing and switch portfolio as well as the Infinera optical products. 
At the recent analyst even in Arizona, Nokia highlighted customers and potential wins in AI infrastructure, including GPU clouds. That area has already been anchored by a deal with recent IPO CoreWeave. But some analysts say that bigger game may be in the mix, including Meta and Google. 
“We believe Nokia shares a new Meta optical scale-across project with Ciena, and the optical book-to-bill again meaningfully exceeded 1x,"" Raymond James analysts Simon Leopold wrote in a research note. “IP traction is emerging with footholds with Microsoft, Google, and CoreWeave, and a new deal with Nscale.”
Many Wall St. analysts rushed to bump up their estimates on the news. Raymond James and Deutsche Bank both lifted their price estimates for Nokia, with Raymond James raising its target to $6.50 from $5 and Deutsche Bank going from €4.75 to €4.25 on European exchanges.
Futuriom has  been highlighting Nokia's potential success with AI-focused clients like CoreWeave. Nokia's flexible, open-source SR Linux operating system has been a key differentiator, with customers citing its simplicity, reliability, and economics. Nokia's solution provided high performance while also demonstrating significant energy efficiency, a critical factor for large-scale AI networking infrastructure.
This quarter may well represent the start of a new era for Nokia, as it has boosted its reputation as major supplier of networking infrastructure for data centers and AI. 
Futuriom provides paid research and marketing services to technology companies, including Nokia, with the goal of providing accurate insight into how cloud and AI infrastructure markets are evolving. These services include subscription research, custom research, and report sponsorships. The author holds no positions in individual technology stocks mentioned in this article."
80,2025-10-23,"Having a gadget’s battery nestled snugly within the bowels of a device has certain advantages. It finally solves the ‘no batteries included’ problem, and there is no more juggling of AA or AAA cells, nor their respective chargers. Instead each device is paired to that one battery that is happily charged using a standardized USB connector, and suddenly everything is well in the world.
Everything, except for the devices that cannot be used while charging, wireless devices that are suddenly dragging along a wire while charging and which may have charging ports in irrational locations, as well as devices that would work quite well if it wasn’t for that snugly embedded battery that’s now dead, dying, or on fire.
Marrying devices with batteries in this manner effectively means tallying up all the disadvantages of the battery chemistries and their chargers, adding them to the device’s feature list, and limiting their effective lifespan in the process. It also prevents the rapid swapping with fresh batteries, which is why everyone is now lugging chunky powerbanks around instead of spare batteries, and hogging outlets with USB chargers. And the task of finding a replacement for non-standardized pouch cell batteries can prove to be hard or impossible.
Looking at the ‘convenience’ argument from this way makes one wonder whether it is all just marketing that we’re being sold. Especially in light of the looming 2027 EU regulation on internal batteries that is likely to wipe out the existence of built-in batteries with an orbital legal strike. Are we about to say ‘good riddance’ to a terrible idea?

To further rub in how much of a terrible idea built-in batteries are, one only has to look at professional equipment, particularly in the audiovisual world. Whether we are talking about DSLRs, mirror-less cameras, or professional video cameras, they all have as standard feature the ability to quickly swap batteries. Nikon and Canon cameras use a range of proprietary-but-standard Li-ion batteries, with Sony’s video camera batteries also used on portable studio lighting. For the super-expensive Red video cameras you can use either the massive Redvolt batteries that dangle off the side or a power adapter.
The reasoning here is simple: when you are doing a photo or film shoot you do not have time for charging, so you load up with a stash of charged batteries beforehand. As the current battery becomes drained, you pop open the battery hatch or detach the current pack and slam in a fresh battery before resuming. During moments of downtime you can put the drained batteries on the charger that you have squirreled away somewhere. This way you stay wireless and charged with zero fuss, and if you have enough batteries, zero downtime.
Even within the era of budget photo and video cameras you’d be able to do this. When it comes to my own JVC camcorder and Canon IXUS 100 IS point-and-shoot camera, both offer this feature, even if the battery swapping experience doesn’t feel as premium as with the Nikon D7200 DSLR and its EN-EL15 batteries that is used for more serious occasions. Swapping batteries with the DSLR in particular is as easy as swapping SD cards, which is to say a matter of seconds.
One might get the idea here that the main reason to stuff a pouch cell somewhere inside the device is mostly a cost-saving measure, as it omits the battery terminals and ejection mechanism for the pack.
Another reason why having a built-in battery with a multi-thousand-Euro DSLR would be a terrible idea beyond the insanity of having to ‘charge the DSLR’, is that the battery will be dead long before even the warranty on the DSLR has expired, especially if you are an avid shooter. Even if you do not use a device that much, the fact of the matter is that lithium-ion cells begin to degrade as soon as they have been manufactured. This may be acceptable in a €1,000+ smartphone when people buy a new one every other year anyway, but becomes a problem when you’d like to use a device for much longer.
A good summary of the how and why of lithium-ion batteries (LIB) can be found in this IEEE review article by Wiljan Vermeer et al. from 2021. The three main aging mechanisms are:
There are multiple ways in which each type of aging can occur, with most requiring the cell to be charged and discharged, as this inflicts mechanical and other types of stress. When it comes to storing LIBs, we enter the territory of calendar aging. This has an irreversible and reversible component, the former being impacted by three components: the state of charge (SoC), temperature, and time.
What this tells us is that although you can affect LIB calendar aging, it’s a pretty inevitable aspect of their chemistry. This is true even in the case of the lithium-polymer (LiPo) LIB type batteries with its polymer electrolyte. This effectively means that charging the battery in a device to 80% instead of 100% will give it some more life, but you’d have to drop down to 50% or less to see the big gains. It’s also highly advisable to keep the battery relatively cool, which is where fast-charging is a terrible idea, especially as the resistance of the battery goes up due to aging.
While the exact mechanisms behind calendar aging are still being investigated, it’s likely that the layer that forms at the electrochemically unstable electrolyte-electrode interface (SEI) restructures to prevent the transfer of lithium ions, effectively increasing the measured resistance via the CL aging path.
In addition to calendar aging you have the charge-discharge cycle-based aging mechanisms, which not only affects the SEI, but also causes mechanical expansion of the graphite anode material, which leads to both the LLI and LAM aging paths. When you then add in the typical charging method for gadgets like smartphones using a LIB-based powerbank, you end up with double the charge-discharge cycles over simply slotting in a fresh battery.
Beyond larger electronic devices, pouch cell LIBs are now integrated in countless more gadgets, from lamps to Bluetooth speakers. To address the sheer volume of these built-in LIBs, the EU’s Battery Regulation will begin to enforce its removability and replaceability requirements starting on 18 February of 2027.
The batteries which we discussed in this article fall under so-called ‘portable batteries’, meaning that it weighs less than 5 kg and is not used for an electric vehicle. These are required to make it possible for the end user to replace and remove, all without damaging or destroying the battery or the device, and without requiring any special tools. There are some partial safety-related exceptions where a professional can do said replacement, while a full exception is limited to a number of very specific device categories.
What exactly the fallout of this change will be remains to be seen, with manufacturers likely starting to adapt their products throughout 2026. Devices like smartphones, game controllers, but also Bluetooth speakers, wireless mice and portable game consoles will all be affected, so it’ll be interesting to see what approach we will see here.
Perhaps most of all what it might mean for standardization of cells and batteries, as every device that’s put on the market in the EU must have spare batteries available for reasonable cost for five years after it stops being sold. Clearly this would be cheaper if the same battery just got used for decades, somewhat like the veritable AA cell and today’s 18650 and similar formats.
The process of standardization is a rough one, with sometimes the legislature leaning into the issue after consultation with a requirement, as with USB-based chargers. Other times the market simply picks something that’s readily available and does the job. One example of this is the Nokia BL-5C battery and its variations, which was quite prevalent due to Nokia using it for its phones and other platforms like the N-Gage. Consequently third-party manufacturers made their own compatible versions for use in a wide range of devices.
While the BL-5C is still fairly large, at 53 mm x 34 mm and a thickness of 6 mm, point and shoot cameras as well as action cameras feature a range of smaller batteries, with the Canon NB-4L as used in the IXUS point and shoot cameras providing more than 750 mAh in a 35 mm x 40 mm package and a similar 5.9 mm thickness. The third-party replacements that I got of the NB-4L claim to provide 1,200 mAh, as modern LIBs tend to have more capacity within the same form factor due to more refined manufacturing.
Interestingly, even rechargeable AA-sized cells aren’t limited to NiMH chemistry any more, with Li-ion options now available yet still providing the 1.5 V one would expect. This does require a bit of electronics in the cell, and results in them having a capacity that’s similar to that of NiMH AA cells, while suffering all the aging issues of any other LIB in addition to the limited number of charge cycles. Assuming that the 1.2 V of NiMH cells is acceptable, then devices could accept AA or AAA NiMH cells.
Of note here is that none of this means that having a power input port for charging the battery or cell inside the device itself is no longer possible or allowed. Depending on the device manufacturer, the new EU regulations should mean little difference for the end user, other than having the option to pop open each device to extract and replace the battery. This could mean that wireless mice and Bluetooth headsets will soon feature an alternative to sticking in that charge cable and have the device be mostly useless until its built-in battery has soaked up sufficient juice.
Although this is an EU-only thing, it’s likely to come to every other part of the globe as well.

  the EU’s Battery Regulation will begin to enforce its removability and replaceability requirements starting on 18 February of 2027.

Good.
My previous wireless headphones got 15 years of use by swapping out worn NiMH batteries, until I sat on and broke them. My present wireless headphones will become useless after 5-6 years, because the manufacturer explicitly told me when I asked them, that it would become a risk if I continue using them after the built-in lithium cells wear out. I paid good money for these headphones with the option to plug in a wire to continue use when the batteries go empty, which would at least let me use them for longer, but that’s a moot point if they might catch on fire while I’m wearing them.
Embedded lithium batteries = planned obsolescence.
FWIW, my wife’s wireless headphones have USB port failure before battery failure :)
I replaced the battery and earpads on my wh-1000xm3 about a year ago. Was like 30$ with tax and shipping.
If it’s a semi-popular model, you will likely be able to buy replacement batteries for them for $10-20.

  Embedded lithium batteries = planned obsolescence.

Only in some cases – or there embedded and then EMBEDDED devices.
As loads of devices with inbuilt battery area really easy to change when you need to – for instance I understand the latest revisions of the Steamdeck have improved the battery adhesive that made removing the old battery very hard in the first batch and all you need to get into one of those is a smaller Philips screwdriver. Though i suspect by the EU’s definition that will mean it actually doesn’t have to change at all – and frankly it shouldn’t need to as the battery will last you a good long while.
Then you get the wireless earbud type things where as a rule the only way to get into them at all is destructively as whatever method used to put them together is one way. I’d suspect your headphones are probably more towards the steamdeck side of things, as most of the headphones I’ve seen while annoying to work on can be worked on if you are careful.
I remember the Panasonic model “I” mobilephone” you got 2x battery packs and a third empty pack that you loaded with regular AA penlight batteries.
I think i want to see a lot of the changes this article recommends but it really comes down to usage.
A professional camera needs to be usable for the entire duration that you can afford to staff it.  You can tag-team cameramen in shifts, one operator after another, and run it 24/7, so you need to be able to refresh the battery on that same schedule.  But my phone, i never use it like that.  I charge it about once every 4 days.
But then i get to re-purposing phones, and suddenly i care again.  A phone that is unused for a while will puff up.  A phone that sits on the charger 24/7 will usually roast its own battery.  A phone that you’ve removed the battery from will refuse to power on.  A phone that’s been re-purposed as a traffic monitoring camera needs a powerbank to have many hours of always-on, just like a professional camera does.
Of all those, the one i resent the most is the inability to turn on once the battery has been removed.  Almost every single repurposing project runs into that one.  The original battery needs to be thrown out and the new use case is compatible with tethering to AC or to a powerbank, but i just can’t do it (easily).  I hacked my Nook to hang on the wall without a battery, but i guess my hack was braindead somehow because it turns itself off about once a week, complaining that there’s no battery.
Sigh.  Anyways, anything is better than a flashlight with replacable AA batteries that nonetheless fails when the batteries run dry because they spew lye all over the contacts, and/or gets physically wedged in there so it destroys the thing to pull them out.
i already have a multi-chemestry charger on my desk that can handle 18650s. sticking on a battery management circuit isn’t that difficult. ive seen a couple methods. the first, the one i use, little strip pcbs that you can spot weld to either end through zinc tabs and put a heat shrink over it. this makes them not quite cylindrical and requires a little bit of clearance and a strip of kapton tape for insulation. other method is an end cap circuit which can either be integrated into the cell itself or as a press fit add-on. depending on which is used may add some length to the cell. though im pretty sure factories could integrate then in the accepted form factor without too much retooling of the lines.
im not sure how that works in multi-cell packs. parallel packs would probibly be easier to do and use a simple management board, but if you need a series pack then you need some balancing which may not be available in simple single cell bmses. when you have a bunch of cells which may be differently aged and at different levels of charge you add a whole new layer of potential failure modes, and this time the industry can buck the blame to user error rather than design flaws.
IMHO, another case where “everything is integrated” is a terrible idea. Integrated things fail integratively, ie, as one unit in one move.
It’s been a long road from “batteries included” to “batteries not included” to “batteries embedded” (for no good reason other than making things fail permanently at whatever moment they decide to fail).
Invent me a tiny pico-fusion-reactor embedded in a car already. The one I got laughed at at the other topic Z-Pinch fusion reactor with all the fuel it needs for the life of an EV. Better yet, a Z-Pinch fusion reactor that can power a house for a family of four, ready set go, EV that can power a small house, TVs, driers, whatever.
Cell phones are last century invention, btw. Time to move forward to something else, better, cheaper, say, houses built by AI “agents” on designated spot, overnight, zero labor costs, only the cost of raw materials and delivery (by automated trucks). Similar local AI “agents” should be making the said “raw materials” locally, not from overseas, and delivering them to all willing, DIY crowd, whomever. While at it, replace pointless congress politicians with people-controlled humanoid robots that could not be commanded by Big Bad Corporations, presto, problem solved, zero salaries, zero spending, endless profit for average Sam. If I don’t like what one of those robots is saying/doing, I remote to it and shut it off (or reprogram the way I need it to work to represent ME, actual human).

  zero labor costs

That’s already the case, or close to. For many items you use every day, labor costs are under 10%. But then the retail cost is not. You see, when people don’t earn money by making things, they make money by selling things, and many more people can join in that game hand-in-hand, demanding all sorts of payments along the way, or turning the products into services…
Or, to put it otherwise, even when robots make things, the cost of people doesn’t go away.
The people will find ways to earn the money to buy the products, whether that’s by adding their cost on top of the price, or by demanding money from the government which then taxes the products to pay it. What that means, you’ll be paying for both: the robots and the people.
It’s a far better idea that people make the products rather than sit idle and invent make-work to get paid.

  IMHO, another case where “everything is integrated” is a terrible idea. Integrated things fail integratively, ie, as one unit in one move.

Most things fail in the same fashion, even with hot swappable battery the device “fails” if you don’t have a good battery at hand because it still requires it work. The car is broken if one of the brakes is locked open/closed, the spark plug fouled etc.
The only thing that really matters is where it falls on the design for servicing or design for forced obsolescence sliding scale. With a small side question of expected lifespan – there is no point in definitively short lived devices being built to last a few centuries with proper maintenance if the need for them is only to live a few hours, and if something really should last many years it better be built to get whatever maintenance it will need.
Good luck making AirPods with replaceable batteries and still retaining their ear-slug form factor.
All legislation has consequences.
On one hand, yes, great idea.
On the other hand, unfortunately people buy cheap crap, and unless the EU can magically halt the flow of dangerously badly made 18650 cells (good luck; they haven’t so far. Their rules only apply to people who want to comply, and increasingly only to certain US companies…) then this seems like a recipe for more house fires when people inevitably get cheap offbrand crap batteries and abuse them.
My elderly neighbor had a cheap chinese radio with solar cell built-in. It worked until its tiny 6V lead-acid battery became worn. He asked me to repair it. After looking for a matching battery I told him, cost of new battery will be higher that buying a new radio of the same make and model.
He then went to a local bazaar and bought some cheap no-name 18650 cell. He asked me to solder it instead of that lead-acid battery. I refused and warned him about that “upgrade” because: this radio doesn’t have a proper charging circuit for lithium cells which creates a risk of fire; I don’t have a spot welder needed to make proper connections to the cell’s terminals.
He then got angry, said something something you university kids don’t know anything and decided to do it himself, using transformer soldering iron from early 1990s.
Two weeks later his summer home burned down. He never spoke to me again.

  On one hand, yes, great idea.

Not sure it really is, trying to treat a problem without actually really dealing with the whole problem – the bit that we want is repairable products that will last a suitably long time and targeting just the battery is not really likely to change that very much if at all, as if the point of being obnoxious on the access for replaceable batteries was planned obsolescence as they know they can get away with it and get you to buy another one there are plenty of other ways to get that result.
And depending on just how much the zealot in the folks interpreting the rules comes out…
Not to mention the selective nature of actually applying such things to imports as you note.
I have a full set of perfectly good last-generation cordless power tools. When the manufacturer went to the new Li batteries they changed the connector. They do make an adapter ($40 each!) so I went that route and switched to the newer batteries. The new ones aren’t as good as the hold NiCads but mostly I get new ones for Christmas sometimes so it hasn’t yet put me off entirely.
.
That said I bought a generic variable power adapter and will harvest an old NiCad pack for the packaging and fab me up a “cordless to corded” adapter that no one seems to make for some reason. It’s in the long ToDo pile on the overflowing workbench.
I want a smartphone that takes a couple 18650s, finally an excuse to make the phone thick enough to have good camera lenses without having them poke out the back.
Good camera lenses?
Perhaps ‘better camera lenses’.
An amazing lens on a CCD imperceptible to the human eye!
At those scales amazing refers to the feat of manufacturing the thing, Not the quality of the sensor reading input.
Embedding batteries is not a new thing – it’s been done since the 70s. Especially for devices that were supposed to be portable but power hungry like early calculators. And they’ve been dying just as long. Heck, cordless phones were some of the biggest offenders of embedded batteries where you had to use soldering irons to change them. Or suicide batteries were common in arcade machines. And plenty of devices had coin cells embedded that died after 15 years, some embedded in equipment costing tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars. And once those died your expensive equipment was useless.

The human condition includes a vast array of unavoidable misfortunes. But what about the preventable ones? Shouldn’t the United States provide for the basic needs of its people?
Such questions get distinctly short shrift in the dominant political narratives. When someone can’t make ends meet and suffers dire consequences, the mainstream default is to see a failing individual rather than a failing system. Even when elected leaders decry inequity, they typically do more to mystify than clarify what has caused it.
While “income inequality” is now a familiar phrase, media coverage and political rhetoric routinely disconnect victims from their victimizers. Human interest stories and speechifying might lament or deplore common predicaments, but their storylines rarely connect the destructive effects of economic insecurity with the ways that corporate power plunders social resources and fleeces the working class. Yet the results are extremely far-reaching.

“We have the highest rate of childhood poverty and senior poverty of any major country on earth,” Sen. Bernie Sanders has pointed out. “You got half of older workers have nothing in the bank as they face retirement. You got a quarter of our seniors trying to get by on $15,000 a year or less.”
Such hardship exists in tandem with ever-greater opulence for the few, including this country’s 800 billionaires. But standard white noise mostly drowns out how government policies and the overall economic system keep enriching the already rich at the expense of people with scant resources.
This year, while Donald Trump and Republican legislators have been boosting oligarchy and slashing enormous holes in the social safety net, Democratic leaders have seemed remarkably uninterested in breaking away from the policy approaches that ended up losing their party the allegiance of so many working-class voters. Those corporate-friendly approaches set the stage for Trump’s faux “populism” as an imagined solution to the discontent that the corporatism of the Democrats had helped usher in.
While offering a rollback to pre-Trump-2.0 policies, the current Democratic leadership hardly conveys any orientation that could credibly relieve the economic distress of so many Americans. The party remains in a debilitating rut, refusing to truly challenge the runaway power of corporate capitalism that has caused ever-widening income inequality.
The Democratic establishment now denounces Trump’s vicious assaults on vital departments and social programs. Unfortunately, three decades ago it cleared a path that led toward the likes of the DOGE wrecking crew. A clarion call in that direction came from President Bill Clinton when, in his 1996 State of the Union address, he exulted that “the era of big government is over.”
I still have a page I tore out of Time magazine in December 1996, weeks after Bill Clinton won re-election. The headline said: “Ex-Investment Bankers and Lawyers Form Clinton’s Economic Team. Surprise! It’s Pro-Wall Street.”
Clinton followed those instantly iconic words by adding, “We cannot go back to the time when our citizens were left to fend for themselves.” Like the horse he rode into Washington — the Democratic Leadership Council, which he co-founded — Clinton advocated a “third way,” distinct from both liberal Democrats and Republican conservatives. But when his speech called for “self-reliance and teamwork” — and when, on countless occasions throughout the 1990s, he invoked the buzzwords “opportunity” and “responsibility” — he was firing from a New Democrat arsenal that targeted “handouts” and “special interests” as obsolete relics of the 1930s New Deal and the 1960s Great Society.
The seminal Clintonian theme of “opportunity” — with little regard for outcome — aimed for a wide political audience. In the actual United States, however, touting opportunity as central to solving the problems of inequity obscured the huge disparities in real-life options. In theory, everyone was to have a reasonable chance; in practice, opportunity was then (and remains) badly skewed by economic status and race, beginning as early as the womb. In a society so stratified by class, “opportunity” as the holy grail of social policy ultimately leaves outcomes to the untender mercies of the market.
We need your help to stay independent
Two weeks before Clinton won the presidency, Time magazine reported that his “economic vision” was “perhaps best described as a call for a We decade; not the old I-am-my-brother’s-keeper brand of traditional Democratic liberalism.” Four weeks later, the magazine showered the president-elect with praise: “Clinton’s willingness to move beyond some of the old-time Democratic religion is auspicious. He has spoken eloquently of the need to redefine liberalism: the language of entitlements and rights and special-interest demands, he says, must give way to talk of responsibilities and duties.”
Clinton and the DLC insisted that government should smooth the way for maximum participation in the business of business. While venerating the market, the New Democrats were openly antagonistic toward labor unions and those they dubbed “special interests,” such as feminists, civil-rights activists, environmentalists and others who needed to be shunted aside to fulfill the New Democrat agenda, which included innovations like “public-private partnerships,” “empowerment zones” and charter schools.
While disparaging advocates for the marginalized as impediments to winning the votes of white “moderates,” the New Democrats embraced corporate America. I still have a page I tore out of Time in December 1996, weeks after Clinton won reelection. The headline said: “Ex-Investment Bankers and Lawyers Form Clinton’s Economic Team. Surprise! It’s Pro-Wall Street.”
That was the year when Clinton and his allies achieved a longtime goal — strict time limits for poor women to receive government assistance. “From welfare to work” became a mantra. Aid to Families with Dependent Children was out and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families was in. Just like three years earlier, when he was able to push NAFTA through Congress only because of overwhelming Republican support, Democratic lawmakers were divided and Clinton came to rely on overwhelming GOP support to make “welfare reform” possible.
The welfare bill that Clinton gleefully signed in August 1996 was the flip side of his elite economic team’s priorities. The victims of “welfare reform” would soon become all too obvious, while their victimizers would remain obscured in the smoke blown by cheerleading government officials, corporate-backed think tanks and mainstream journalists. When Clinton proclaimed that such landmark legislation marked the end of “welfare as we know it,” he was hailing the triumph of a messaging siege that had raged for decades.
Across much of the country’s media spectrum, prominent pundits had long been hammering away at “entitlements,” indignantly claiming that welfare recipients, disproportionately people of color, were sponging off government largesse. The theme was a specialty of conservative columnists like Charles Krauthammer, John Leo and George Will (who warned in November 1993 that the nation’s “rising illegitimacy rate … may make America unrecognizable”). But some commentators who weren’t right-wing made similar arguments, while ardently defaming the poor.

Newsweek’s star writer Joe Klein often accused inner-city Black people of such defects as “dependency” and “pathology.” Three months after Clinton became president, Klein wrote that “out-of-wedlock births to teenagers are at the heart of the nexus of pathologies that define the underclass.” The next year, he intensified his barrage. In August 1994, under the headline “The Problem Isn’t the Absence of Jobs, But the Culture of Poverty,” he peppered his piece with phrases like “welfare dependency,” while condemning “irresponsible, antisocial behavior that has its roots in the perverse incentives of the welfare system.”
Such punditry was unconcerned with the reality that, even if they could find and retain employment while struggling to raise families, what awaited the large majority of the women being kicked off welfare were dead-end jobs at very low wages.
During the 1990s, Bill and Hillary Clinton fervently mapped out paths for poor women that would ostensibly make private enterprise the central solution to poverty. A favorite theme was the enticing (and facile) notion that people could rise above poverty by becoming entrepreneurs.
Along with many speeches by the Clintons, some federal funds were devoted to programs to help lenders offer microcredit so that low-income people could start small enterprises. Theoretically, the result would be both well-earning livelihoods and self-respect for people who had pulled themselves out of poverty. Of course, some individual success stories became grist for upbeat media features. But as the years went by, the overall picture would distinctly be one of failure.
In 2025, politicians continue to laud small business ventures as if they could somehow remedy economic ills. But such endeavors aren’t likely to bring long-term financial stability, especially for people with little start-up money to begin with. Current figures indicate that one-fifth of all new small businesses fail within the first year and the closure rate only continues to climb after that. Fifty percent of small businesses fail within five years, and 65% crumble within 10 years.
Promoting the private sector as the solution to social inequities inevitably depletes the public sector and its capacity to effectively serve the public good. Three decades after the Clinton presidency succeeded in blinkering the Democratic vision of what economic justice might look like, the party’s leaders are still restrained by assumptions that guarantee vast economic injustice — to the benefit of those with vast wealth.
“We must start by challenging the faith that public policy, private philanthropy and the culture at large has placed in the market to accomplish humanitarian goals,” writes historian Lily Geismer.
“Structural problems require structural solutions,” Sanders wrote in a 2019 op-ed piece, “and promises of mere ‘access’ have never guaranteed black Americans equality in this country… ‘Access’ to health care is an empty promise when you can’t afford high premiums, co-pays or deductibles. And an ‘opportunity’ for an equal education is an opportunity in name only when you can’t afford to live in a good school district or to pay college tuition. Jobs, health care, criminal justice and education are linked, and progress will not be made unless we address the economic systems that oppress Americans at their root.”
But addressing the root of economic systems that oppress Americans is exactly what the Democratic Party leadership, dependent on big corporate donors, has rigorously refused to do. Looking ahead, unless Democrats can really put up a fight against the pseudo-populism of the rapacious and fascistic Trump regime, they are unlikely to regain the support of the working-class voters who deserted them in last year’s election.
During this month’s federal government shutdown, Republicans were ruthlessly insistent on worsening inequalities in the name of breaking or shaking up the system. Democrats fought tenaciously to defend Obamacare and a health-care status quo that still leaves tens of millions uninsured or underinsured, while medical bills remain a common worry and many people go without the care they need.
“We must start by challenging the faith that public policy, private philanthropy, and the culture at large has placed in the market to accomplish humanitarian goals,” historian Lily Geismer writes in her insightful and deeply researched book “Left Behind: The Democrats’ Failed Attempt to Solve Inequality.” “We cannot begin to seek suitable and sustainable alternatives until we understand how deep that belief runs and how detrimental its consequences are.”
The admonitions in Geismer’s book, published three years ago, cogently apply to the present and future. “The best way to solve the vexing problems of poverty, racism, and disinvestment is not by providing market-based microsolutions,” she pointed out. “Macroproblems need macrosolutions. It is time to stop trying to make the market do good. It is time to stop trying to fuse the functions of the federal government with the private sector… It is the government that should be providing well-paying jobs, quality schools, universal childcare and health care, affordable housing, and protections against surveillance and brutality from law enforcement.”
Although such policies now seem a long way off, clearly articulating the goals is a crucial part of the struggle to achieve them. Those who suffer from the economic power structure are victims of a massively cruel system, being made steadily crueler by the presidency of Donald Trump. But progress is possible with clarity about how the system truly works and the victimizers who benefit from it.

    Unsure of which piece of fitness tech is worth it? This is what the experts have to say.
  
There are countless pieces of fitness technology on the market today, making it challenging to determine which is best suited to your specific needs. Though I've tested many of these products over the years as CNET's resident fitness expert, I was curious to see what other experts recommend to their clients. That's why I reached out to certified personal trainers and physical therapists with the question: What is your number one favorite piece of fitness technology? This is what they recommended. 
Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source on Chrome.
A massage gun is a helpful tool to have on hand if you’re looking for recovery relief. I’ve tested many massage guns and have some personal favorites. Certified personal trainer, running coach and massage therapist at Knead Massage, Amanda Grimm recommends investing in one, especially if you exercise regularly. 
“Regular use of a massage gun will reduce your recovery time between training sessions, allowing you to train more consistently and with more intensity,” she says. Additionally, massage guns can help improve your range of motion, so you’re prepped to take on any workout. 
“The most obvious advantage that my clients report is decreased muscle soreness in the days after a tough session,” explains Grimm. Taking your recovery seriously also has its advantages. The faster you feel recovered, the faster you can return to your next workout.
If you’re new to using a massage gun, Grimm recommends using it before and after a workout for just a few minutes at a time. “Using a massage gun on a slower speed pre-workout allows us to target the major muscle groups that we're going to be working, boosting the blood flow and increasing the available range of motion,” she explains. 
For post-workout, Grimm advises targeting the main muscle groups you focused on during your workout. “Using a medium intensity setting for one to two minutes will help flush out excess fluid and inflammation and kick-start the recovery process,” she says.
Grimm's favorite massage guns include the Renpho R3 Mini Massage Gun and the Theragun Pro. “I like the Renpho R3 because it’s affordable and compact, making it a good choice to pop in your gym bag,” she says. She notes that it’s powerful for its size and price and features multiple speed settings, making it a versatile little tool.
The Theragun Pro is her preferred professional-grade massage gun that she uses with all her clients. “The Theragun Pro is packed with great features, including an impressive 16mm amplitude (which is basically the depth of each ‘hit’ into your muscle tissue) and fantastic ergonomic design, with a rotating arm and really comfortable handle,” she says. This is also CNET’s best massage gun pick, which we recommend for serious athletes. 
The Apple Watch SE 3.
As someone who enjoys running, I’ve always liked tracking my runs on an Apple Watch because it’s easy to read and seamlessly connects with my iPhone. Personal trainer, fitness coach and sports dietitian Umo Callins of Well Rooted Health and Nutrition, based in Oklahoma City, also swears by the Apple Watch. 
“I like the different workout options it has to track, and I recommend fitness watches to my clients who don’t mind having something on their wrist and benefit from data,” says Callins, adding, “I find that my data-driven clients are more consistent with their lifestyle and physical activity when wearing fitness watches.”
The latest Apple Watch Series 11 has added an FDA-cleared hypertension alert feature, improved battery life and sleep tracking. Callins likes that the Apple Watch shows her activity trends on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. Additionally, on days she isn’t as active, it nudges her to get moving. “I also like that it syncs to my Oura Ring, which helps with learning about how my body recovers from day to day, my sleep patterns and overall readiness, which is a major part of what dictates my workouts,” she adds. 
I’ve tested walking treadmills previously and appreciate that they take up minimal space and allow you to multitask. Certified personal trainer, registered dietitian and owner of One Pot Wellness, Wan Na Chun swears by her under-desk treadmill. “As someone who works from home, a walking pad helps me stay active instead of sitting for long periods,” she says. 
Chun also recommends walking pads to clients, who have loved how simple they are for incorporating more daily movement. This is because the walking pad makes staying active more accessible, regardless of weather or busy schedules. Chun particularly enjoys using the Kingsmith Walk and Work walking pad and says she’s been using it for years while taking calls, reading or doing work on her computer. 
Chun recommends that clients use a walking pad as a low-impact option to help them get steps in primarily, but says it shouldn’t be their only form of exercise. “An under-desk treadmill is meant to complement your structured workouts by keeping the body active in small and sustainable ways throughout the day,” Chun explains. She says that, on average, she can easily clock in about 5,000 steps daily at a slow pace and adds, “I particularly find it helpful during the winter months when I’m less active outdoors because of poor weather conditions.”
The Whoop 5.0 band.
If you’re serious about your recovery and want to track that data, Ed Gemdjian, general manager and certified personal trainer at The Gym Venice, recommends the Whoop band. Gemdjian specializes in working with clients age 40 and older. He says, “It gives clear daily readiness for work and training by combining heart rate variability, resting heart rate and sleep quality.” This allows him to use the data provided by the device to match the training load to recovery for his clients. ”This is especially valuable for our over-40 clients who thrive with smart progression and appropriate recovery,” he adds.
Gemdjian understands the importance of sleep and being well recovered, and the Whoop offers him better insight into his clients’ habits. “We review sleep metrics and provide sleep hygiene coaching to address common non-medical issues such as inconsistent bedtimes, caffeine timing and screen use before bed,” he says. The Whoop is a good screenless wearable option that provides the wellness data you need without getting in the way during sleep or when you’re in the gym.
A DEXA scan can give you insights into your fitness progress.
If you have access to a DEXA scan or an InBody scan, these are some of the best ways to track your progress. This type of assessment is usually done in a gym or a practitioner’s office that carries this type of equipment, as it’s not available to consumers. The DEXA scan is considered the gold standard for measuring everything from bone mineral density (it’s mainly used for osteoporosis screenings), lean muscle mass, fat mass, hydration levels and much more. 
It gives you the closest accurate data about your body versus hopping on a scale that simply weighs you. Gemdjian uses these tools with his clients to get a baseline at onboarding and then rechecks every eight to 12 weeks to see if there have been any physiological changes. “We coach to trends, not single numbers, so if skeletal muscle mass is up and visceral fat is down, we know we are on the right track even if body weight has not moved much,” he explains."

Overnight, Valve released a new patch for Counter-Strike 2 and one small change to how cosmetics work has crashed the entire CS skins market, with some items listing hundreds of dollars of value in just a few hours. 
The patch notes for Counter-Strike 2 were headlined by the return of the Retakes mode and some map changes, but hidden towards the bottom was a new feature related to skins. Now players can trade in five StatTrak Covert items, which while rare, do not typically run into the crazy money some high value skins do, and in exchange receive a StatTrak Knife, which were some of the most expensive items available. You can then also trade in five regular Covert items, which again are not typically super high end, and receive a regular Knife item or a regular Gloves item, which typically have carried higher prices. 
This is now a guaranteed way to secure some of the rarer cosmetic items in Counter-Strike 2, something that has not really been possible before, and as a result a lot of players have taken Valve up on the offer. This has obviously had a major impact on the prices of a lot of items, and the overall market. 
While most of the items that can be used to trade up to get a knife or gloves have risen in price, the prices of the knives and gloves has absolutely tanked, with some losing around 70% of their value in the last 24 hours. 
The move is somewhat surprising, given Valve can make a ton of money by taking a cut of any skin sales on their community marketplace system, but this could actually be a smart move for the company, given a lot of high value items such as knifes and gloves are typically traded on external sites where Valve does not get a cut. By destroying the price of those items, there is less incentive to trade them elsewhere and instead do it on Steam, giving Valve a cut they would otherwise miss out on. 
There is also some speculation that this could be the start of a wider change to the CS skins economy, with Valve potentially looking to move away from loot boxes, which are becoming increasingly regulated across the world, and move to other systems instead. This follows a new type of Counter-Strike 2 case released earlier in the year that lets you unlock it and see the item inside for free, but requires you to pay a set price to actually get the item, rather than gambling on what it inside the box when you buy it.

The U.K.'s competition watchdog has flexed its muscles in the mobile app market, slapping ""strategic market status"" on Apple and Google.
In a widely expected move, the Competition and Markets Authority has imposed the designation on each of the companies' mobile platforms, covering operating systems, app distribution, browsers and browser engines on smartphones and tablets.
It's a move that's been on the cards since the beginning of this year, when the U.K.'s new digital markets competition regime came into force.
And it means that the CMA can now consider ""proportionate, targeted interventions"" to make sure that mobile platforms are open to effective competition, and that consumers and businesses that rely on Google and Apple can be confident that they're being treated fairly.
""The app economy generates 1.5% of the UK’s GDP and supports around 400,000 jobs, which is why it’s crucial these markets work well for business so they can invest, innovate and drive the growth this country needs,"" said Will Hayter, executive director for digital markets at the CMA.
""Apple and Google’s mobile platforms are used by thousands of businesses right across the economy to market and sell products and services to millions of customers, but the platforms’ rules may be limiting innovation and competition.""
Interventions might include, for example, giving users the clear option to switch to a rival website for purchases, notification of all mergers and acquisitions, and regulation of how search engines and apps are ranked and presented.
The decision has been welcomed by the Coalition for App Fairness (CAF), which represents 80 app developers and SMEs including UK-founded Checkatrade, Spotify, Epic Games, and Match Group. It's been campaigning for changes to the app market for some time.
""The CMA’s investigations found that Apple and Google hold monopoly power over the mobile app ecosystem—and now is the time for strong, enforceable conduct requirements,"" said global policy counsel Gene Burrus.
""This decision must now lead to the necessary remedies to spark effective competition in app stores and growth in the UK economy. This includes giving developers the ability to communicate freely and directly with their users about better offers and services, and opening new distribution channels for apps. Only then will consumers see lower prices and have genuine choice.”
However, the Computer & Communications Industry Association isn't quite so keen, claiming that consumers are perfectly happy with the choices they've already got—and that similar decisions in other countries have made things worse for consumers.
""The lack of guardrails in the new regulatory regime and the opaque and often closed-door designation process we have seen thus far will mean enormous uncertainty for companies innovating and investing in the UK,"" said Matthew Sinclair, the CCIA UK’s senior director.
""It is vital that the CMA takes a more careful approach when considering conduct requirements and responds to the clear steer from ministers to prioritize investment and growth.""
In response to the decision, Google pointed out that that the CMA's own figures show that 91% of UK consumers are ‘satisfied’ or ‘very satisfied’ with their Android mobile devices.
More than two thirds of UK Android devices come with a non-Play app store preloaded, it said, and Chrome browsers are installed on 70% of UK Android devices.
""This decision is disappointing, disproportionate and unwarranted,"" said Oliver Bethell, senior director for competition at Google.
""The UK’s new digital markets regime was introduced with the promise of being pro-growth and pro-innovation, with the CMA emphasizing that its work would be highly targeted and proportionate. In this context, we simply do not see the rationale for today’s designation decision.""
Apple has been approached for comment."

Renowned forecaster Gary Shilling, who predicted the US housing market's collapse in 2008, has told Business Insider that stocks could crash 30% amid ""extreme speculation"" in financial markets.
Shilling, who earned a 16-fold return by partnering with hedge fund manager John Paulson to bet the housing bubble would burst, said there was a ""tremendous amount of speculation"" but that such hype ""never appears to be extreme"" in the moment.
The president of A. Gary Shilling & Co. and former chief economist of Merrill Lynch, who has previously warned of a market crash and impending recession, only for stocks to keep climbing to record highs, told Business Insider, ""It's only in retrospect, after the bubbles break, that you can look back and say, 'Boy, that was really out of hand'.""
Shilling, 88, said he was worried about the concentration of investor cash in the Magnificent Seven stocks — which account for more than a third of the total value of the S&P 500 — and high-risk assets such as cryptocurrencies.
""These are not the guts of the economy, these are the flourishes,"" Shilling said about AI stocks and crypto. ""It's what you typically get when you get extreme speculation at the end of the cycle.""
One of the Mag 7, Nvidia, has grown 13-fold over the past five years to become the world's most valuable company with a $4.4 trillion market capitalization. Apple and Microsoft have more than doubled their market values in the same period to over $3.8 trillion each. The most popular crypto, bitcoin, is up more than eightfold over the same period and hit a record high of $126,000 earlier this month.
Looking back at the major bear markets since World War II, Shilling said a ""30% decline in the S&P 500 is pretty much the norm."" A crash of that scale would take the benchmark stock index from a near-record high of about 6,700 points to around 4,700 points, erasing all of its gains since the start of 2024.
Shilling said the signals from ""harbingers"" such as the Leading Economic Index and the Treasury yield curve are ""very reminiscent of a forthcoming recession,"" but a downturn could arrive anytime from a ""couple of months to a couple of years"" from now.
The veteran forecaster said the job market is ""deteriorating"" and there were ""limits"" on how much debt consumers could rack up as living costs soar. ""People can't continue to spend indefinitely,"" he said.
Shilling said there was nothing to suggest a downturn would be ""particularly spectacular."" He added he hasn't seen any ""really big extremes"" such as the ""dot-com nonsense"" or the ""huge imbalances"" in subprime mortgages during the mid-2000s housing bubble that preceded a global financial crisis.
He said the ""longer it takes to get there, and the more speculation there is, and the more conviction that we're never going to have another downturn, then the worse it's likely to be.""
Shilling shrugged off concerns that the dollar would cease to be dominant in global trade and commerce, fueled by countries such as Russia and India shifting away from the reserve currency. ""What could replace a dollar?"" he said. ""There really is no alternative.""
He said that China's desire to control the yuan would forestall its wider adoption, and Europe's slow growth would hamper the euro, setting the stage for the dollar to remain the ""world's currency.""

86,2025-10-23,"A White House dinner about the project included many tech and crypto companies.
While the Trump administration has yet to release a full list of donors contributing to the planned construction of a White House ballroom, a picture of potential donors and companies funding the project is beginning to emerge. 
President Donald Trump again reiterated in the Oval Office on Wednesday afternoon that the ballroom is being ""paid for 100% by me and some friends of mine,"" referencing donors. ""The government is paying absolutely nothing."" 
Trump also appeared to increase the cost estimate by $50-$100 million, telling reporters during his remarks on Wednesday the price tag for the new venue was ""about $300 million"" -- more than the $200-$250 million estimates previously given. 
Earlier this month, the Trump administration released a list of people and companies who were expected to attend a dinner at the White House about the construction project. 
While no full list of donors has been released, the names of some companies scheduled to attend the dinner released by the White House largely come from the tech and crypto industries, including Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta and Microsoft, along with Coinbase, Ripple and Tether. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, two tech and cryptocurrency investors, were also on the list. 
Some companies have already reaped lucrative contracts during Trump's second term, including Microsoft and Google which landed contracts for their AI and cloud tools, while Amazon Web Services received potentially up to $1 billion in cloud-credit incentives. 
The crypto industry at large has seen major benefits under Trump through policies and executive orders, with Trump's own family amassing billions through crypto ventures during his second term.
Other companies, like Palantir and Lockheed Martin, have billions in contracts with the Trump administration, including the Defense Department.
""We're also working with the military on it because they want to make sure everything is perfect,"" Trump said Wednesday evening of the ballroom construction project. ""And the military is very much involved in this. They want to make sure everything is absolutely beautiful."" 
While the White House has not been transparent about how exactly the project will be paid through donations, the money appears to be going to the project in different ways. 
For example, according to court documents, Google's parent Alphabet noted in a recent legal settlement reached with Trump after he was banned from YouTube following Jan. 6, 2021, that it would be contributing $22 million to help build the White House ballroom. 
The settlement noted that the $22 million will be contributed on Trump's behalf ""to the Trust for the National Mall, a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt entity dedicated to restoring, preserving, and elevating the National Mall, to support the construction of the White House State Ballroom."" 
Paolo Tiramani, CEO of a construction company and a donor on the White House list, donated $10 million in stock to the Trust for the National Mall, his company confirmed in a statement.
Donations for the ballroom are made to the Trust for the National Mall, a nonprofit that supports the National Park Service and is dedicated to the restoration of the National Mall and the White House and Presidents Park.
The financial director of Trump's 2024 campaign, Meredith O'Rourke, is leading the donor effort for the ballroom, sources told ABC News.
The Trust's role in the project is to manage donations while the National Park Service and the White House are leading the design and construction. 
The renovation project is more extensive than Trump had previously let on. 
A preservation group has asked the White House to pause the ballroom project, but the White House expects the entire East Wing to be demolished as soon as this weekend as part of the renovation.

Morocco Set As Country Of Focus For 2026 Berlinale‘s EFM

	Morocco will be the country in focus at the 2026 edition of the Berlinale’s European Film Market (EFM). The market said the choice was a reflection of the country’s growing footprint as an international location, bolstered by a 30 percent cash rebate, as well as its bubbling local cinema scene led by the likes of Nabil Ayouch, Faouzi Bensaïdi, Asmae El Moudir, Halima Ouardiri and Maryam Touzani. “The Moroccan film and media landscape has reached a new level of international visibility,” said Tanja Meissner, Director of the festival’s industry-focused Berlinale Pro department. “It combines a strong national cinema with an openness to international collaboration, offering high production value, skilled professionals and distinctive locations. These factors, along with targeted support mechanisms, make Morocco one of the most compelling focus countries in recent years.”  The EFM previously put the spotlight on Mexico, Canada, Norway, Chile, the Baltic States, Italy and Spain. The market will take place from February 12 to 18, 2026 as part of the 76th Berlinale.

I’ve written a lot about the AOL–>AT&T–>Time Warner–>Discovery mergers simply because I think they perfectly encapsulate the pointless, destructive incompetence at the heart of modern media consolidation, and the cannibalistic nature of Wall Street’s obsession with illusory quarterly growth propped up by smoke, mirrors, and complex accounting. 
Ever since the original AOL Time Warner merger back in 2001, an endless wave of pointless mergers promised no limit of innovative “synergies,” but instead resulted in more than 50,000 layoffs, shittier product, higher prices, the death of a ton of well-loved brands and IPs, decades of chaos, a decline in quality journalism, and a bottomless well of shit. 
All so some overpaid execs could nab some tax breaks and short-term stock boosts and put “savvy dealmaker” on their resume — before failing upward to the next bad idea.
Mass U.S. media is the purest form of enshittification. And because nobody in this chain of dysfunction is financially incentivized to learn from experience, we’re about to do it all over again.
Time Warner has formally announced that it’s once again up for sale. The most likely buyer? Larry Ellison’s nepobaby son David, who just bribed the President so he could buy CBS and turn it into a right wing propaganda mill (he’s also likely a new co-owner of TikTok). If Ellison wants Time Warner, it’s estimated that it will cost somewhere around $60 billion:
“David Ellison’s mission: grab Warner Bros Discovery before it splits. The freshly minted media mogul behind Paramount is considering various options, including possibly bypassing the board of the HBO and CNN owner and going straight to shareholders instead. To tempt them will probably cost about $60 billion.”
Ellison is on an acquisition spree (CBS, CNN, TikTok) trying to build a major modern media giant with a decidedly right wing bent (see the whole Bari Weiss fracas). Which isn’t great for a media and journalism environment already dominated by right wing billionaires trying to blow smoke up their own asses. 
I’d like you to play a little game with me. Pluck any of the hundreds of stories of Time Warner’s latest likely sale from the newswires, and see if they there’s any mention of the disastrous recent history of Time Warner Discovery and AT&T’s mergers under the leadership of CEO David Zaslav. Or the terrible real-world impact this sort of consolidation always has on market health, labor, or consumers. 
You (usually) won’t see it because consolidation creates a media that’s too broken and feckless to honestly report on itself. Instead you get a lot of journalistic-simulacrum that kind of mimics the look and style of journalism, but is just as hollow as as a jack-o-lantern. 
Time Warner will be sold, again. The resulting debt will result in all manner of cost cutting from the acquiring company to pay off unmanageable debt (see: CBS already firing employees en masse). The executives responsible will profit from short term stock boosts and tax breaks, but will be nowhere to be found when layoffs abound, prices, soar, customers flee, and the whole thing starts to unravel. Again. 
But however bad past media mergers of this type have been, you should prepare for everything to get much, much dumber now that the U.S. government has eviscerated whatever was left of regulatory independence and our already flimsy dedication to antitrust reform.
Despite what Matt Stoller types promised during the last election season, The Trump administration isn’t even bothering with America’s usual half-assed pretense at caring about corporate power. His FCC is gutting whatever was left of media consolidation limits across all sectors. His courts are making it so serious corporate accountability (of any kind) is effectively now legally impossible. 
That’s going to result in all manner of massive, harmful deals we couldn’t have imagined previously across telecom, media, and tech, as oligarchs try to goose earnings and dominate the entirety of modern media. With zero functional regulatory oversight. In a country controlled by unhinged zealots. 
What could possibly go wrong?

So HBO-Max-MAx-Super-Duper-HBO-Max-Again-Whatever-The-Name-Is-Now is going to get even worse?
I remember when I thought “Well, Discovery can’t possibly be as bad as AT&T; at least they’re a TV company, not the phone company.”
Sure learned my lesson from that one!
I wish I had a few billion laying around so I could buy it and just tell people to make good content and don’t worry about its political stance or who it offends.
No group or single person should have that much power or concentrate that much wealth. That’s where the problems come from, sadly.
But you’ll go out of business because Netflix makes crap and is hogging the audience. Turns out people love crap. I have no faith that “quality” will lure them away. If that were true, why doesn’t AppleTV have 300M subscribers and Netflix have 40M instead of the reverse?

  Netflix makes crap and is hogging the audience. Turns out people love crap.

People have been saying that about other networks for a very long time, such as Fox in the 1990s (“Fox turned into a hard-core sex channel so gradually I didn’t even notice”). And about “reality” television in general, shortly thereafter.
But, at least, for all the talk of “disaster” and so on, probably nobody’s gonna die from this, and there aren’t gonna be billions of dollars in insurance payouts. It seems like an exaggeration when we’re only talking about entertainment; specifically about one shitty company getting a little shittier. In my view, we might as well let them all merge into Consolidated Shit Inc.; delaying their death doesn’t actually help the public, and the people working on shows might do better once the current monopsonistic market is obviously defunct.
Wasn’t this already done in Idiocracy?  Well, if we are going that way, I’m looking forward to seeing the next supreme court case!
If this merger happens, Ellison is going to burn thru a lot of daddy’s money and end up with a mess in a few years.
The issue is, Warners is sketchy but salvageable while Paramount-Skydance is just badly off. A loser in the streaming wars, IP is mediocre, all those cable and broadcast assets are losing value fast.
Jamming sketchy and beyond-sketchy companies together is just going to result in a very sketchy company. You can’t synergy your way past the basic problem, that Netflix changed all the rules, destroyed the lucrative cable and broadcast businesses, helped make the theatrical business a lot tougher (only the top blockbuster franchises need apply), and destroyed physical media.
Meanwhile, social media and YouTube have destroyed the old Discovery type middling “documentary” content business as well as news. So Ellison is going to have two albatrosses on his hands: CBS and CNN. I bet he blows it with both because it’s unclear whether there’s a way to save any of the old broadcast or cable news businesses. The audience has evaporated except for old people headed for the boneyard and the advertisers don’t want them.
The upside is, maybe he’ll blow daddy’s money making a lot of entertaining content for us but nobody should be investing in this very iffy plan.
“When” not “if”.
To be fair, Matt Stoller no longer thinks the Trump administration will do any kind of antitrust.
On the negative, he is dumb enough to think there was originally and then there was an internal coup at the FTC rather than the intention all along.

Comfort Systems USA (NYSE:FIX) operates as a competitor to Quanta Services (NYSE: PWR) in the Construction & Engineering sector, and has:
1) A lower valuation (P/OpInc) when compared to Quanta Services stock2) Yet it shows greater revenue and operating income growth
This discrepancy between valuation and performance suggests that purchasing FIX stock may be a better option than investing in PWR stock
Investing in a single stock can be precarious, but a well-rounded, diversified strategy carries significant value. If you are looking for potential gains with reduced volatility compared to holding a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio (HQ) – HQ has surpassed its benchmark, which incorporates the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap index, achieving returns of over 105% since its launch. Effective risk management is essential – imagine how long-term portfolio performance could improve if you included 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto alongside HQ’s performance metrics.
 
Key Metrics Compared
 
OpInc = Operating Income, P/OpInc = Price To Operating Income Ratio
However, do these statistics capture the complete picture? Read Buy or Sell PWR Stock to determine whether Quanta Services still possesses an advantage that withstands scrutiny. For context, Quanta Services (PWR) specializes in providing contracting services worldwide, concentrating on electric power infrastructure design, construction, maintenance, aviation, emergency restoration, and various engineering and technical services.
This is only one method to assess investments. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio analyzes significantly more factors and aims to mitigate stock-specific risk while offering upside potential
Is The Discrepancy In Stock Price Temporary?
One approach to determine whether Quanta Services stock is currently overpriced relative to other stocks is to compare how these metrics stood across companies one year ago. More specifically, if there has been a significant reversal in trend for Quanta Services over the last 12 months, there is a possibility that the current discrepancy might correct itself. Conversely, sustained underperformance in revenue and operating income growth for Quanta Services would reinforce the conclusion that its stock is pricey compared to its competitors, potentially delaying any correction.

Other Metrics Worth Evaluating
While buying based on valuation can be appealing, it should be assessed thoroughly from various perspectives. This multi-factor evaluation is precisely how we design Trefis portfolio strategies. If you are looking for upside with a more stable experience than individual stock ownership, reflect on the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, accumulating over 105% returns since its inception.

 Tesla's monthslong upward run has slowed. That has investors contemplating what's next for the stock with a vote on a huge new pay package for its chief just around the corner.

 Shares of the EV maker and would-be AI giant wavered between gains and losses Thursday afternoon, after the company last night turned in third-quarter financial results that included some upbeat news—a return to year-over-year quarterly sales growth, for example—but also earnings per share that came in lower than Wall Street analysts expected. Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk used the conference call to restate his longer-term vision, but investors are showing some signs of wariness.

 The stock has pulled back about 3% from its highs earlier this month, cutting into the year-to-date gains the stock had managed after climbing off spring lows. Meanwhile, how to think about Tesla—as a carmaker with global ambitions, a trade on Musk's aspirations, or something in between—is a familiar topic for investors. In the wake of the Q3 results, the takes of bullish and bearish analysts detail the latest subjects in the debate.

The Tesla stock ride has always meant some volatility, and today is no exception. The stock initially slipped before making a comeback in recent trading, indicating at least some short-term wariness about what price investors should be willing to pay to be part of Elon Musk's vision.
 At Wedbush, analyst Dan Ives—one of the Street's big Tesla bulls, with a $600 price target that is nearly 60% above the Visible Alpha average near $378 and roughly 40% higher than Wednesday's close—says the focus was as much on autonomy, robotaxis, and Optimus robots as car sales. (Musk last night said Tesla's AI strategy is at an ""inflection point."")

 ""We continue to believe Tesla could reach a $2 trillion market cap in early 2026 in a bull case scenario and $3 trillion by the end of 2026 as the golden AI chapter takes hold at Tesla,"" Wedbush wrote. (Tesla's current market cap is around $1.4 trillion.)

 JPMorgan's analysts have a $150 price target on the shares—among the lowest tracked by Visible Alpha—even as they cite ""bold"" products, ""visionary leadership,"" and a sense that ""technology and execution risk seem substantially less than was once feared."" The analysts cut their earnings-per-share estimates through 2027, citing concerns about spending and operating expenses.

 ""Expansion into higher volume segments with lower price points seems fraught with greater risk relative to demand, execution, and competition,"" they wrote.

 The next big milestone for Tesla is due early next month, with shareholders set to advance on an incentive-laden pay proposal that could make Musk a trillionaire. Some proxy firms are urging shareholders to vote against the package; on its X account, Tesla says Musk ""is the CEO that can make this ambitious vision a reality.""

Australia’s tiny house movement has found its perfect ambassador in the Harper, a stunning 20-square-meter dwelling that redefines what small-scale living can be. Created by Gold Coast-based Black Clay, this compact home proves that downsizing doesn’t mean downgrading when it comes to style and comfort.
The Harper stretches eight meters long and 2.5 meters wide, built on a robust triple-axle steel trailer designed for full transportability. What immediately strikes visitors is the exterior’s sophisticated blend of curved Decobatten aluminum and Colorbond steel cladding. This combination creates a timber-like aesthetic that demands attention while requiring minimal maintenance.
Designer: Black Clay







Step inside, and the Harper reveals its true character through carefully selected materials and thoughtful design choices. Architectural birch plywood lines the interior walls, creating warmth against the rich timber oak flooring. The kitchen serves as the home’s centerpiece, occupying 2.5 meters of prime real estate with Caesarstone benchtops and Laminex cabinetry in Porcelain Blush and Coolum Sand finishes that add subtle sophistication.
Living spaces flow naturally throughout the Harper’s interior, with the built-in lounge featuring hidden storage drawers beneath the seating. The bedroom continues the home’s commitment to both comfort and style, incorporating a queen-size bed base with additional storage underneath and subtly curved walls that create an enveloping sanctuary feel. Floor-to-ceiling windows throughout flood the interior with natural light and create seamless connections to the outdoors.







The bathroom showcases modern design sensibilities with full tiling and a striking concrete basin, while environmental consciousness runs throughout the Harper’s design. Earthwool insulation in walls and ceiling ensures energy efficiency, and full off-grid options cater to those seeking complete energy independence. This sustainability focus aligns with the growing desire for more intentional living that respects environmental boundaries.
Black Clay founders Justin and Rachel have positioned their company around creating “thoughtfully designed tiny homes built for people to enjoy in beautiful environments.” Priced from around US$77,500, the Harper represents a significant investment that delivers luxury finishes and thoughtful design typically associated with much larger homes. The Harper tiny house demonstrates that small-scale living can embody sophistication, comfort, and environmental responsibility, offering a compelling vision of downsized luxury for those ready to embrace intentional living.


The Harper’s versatility extends beyond personal use, positioning it perfectly for the growing short-term rental market and luxury retreat sector. Property investors are increasingly recognizing the potential of high-end tiny homes as Airbnb offerings, where guests seek unique accommodations that provide both novelty and comfort.
The Harper’s sophisticated design and premium finishes make it an ideal candidate for such ventures, capable of commanding premium nightly rates while offering guests an immersive experience in minimalist luxury. Its transportable nature also allows owners to relocate their investment to capitalize on seasonal tourism patterns or changing market demands.

Valve has taken a sledgehammer to the Counter Strike 2 skins market in a ""small update"", which allows players to trade five regular Covert skins for a fairly rare cosmetic for your knives and gloves.
That might not sound like a big deal, in fact, it probably sounds like a nice way of allowing casual players to cycle out older skins they don't like for something fancier. Here's the rub: Counter Strike 2 skins are tradable on the Steam market, and knife / gloves skins have historically sold for some serious money.
To understand why, you need to know the primary method of earning skins. In Counter Strike 2, players open weapon cases for skins. These are for the most part loot boxes containing weapon skins, and the rarest golden prize you can get from these cases are knife and gloves skins. Different weapon cases can give different varieties of knives and gloves, for example the Prisma 2 case drops the Stiletto knife with a random camo on it.
So prior to the small update, if you wanted a really cool looking knife, you had to pay real money for these weapon cases and try your luck on getting a knife. Alternatively, you could buy a knife you wanted. For reference a knife I like - the Stiletto Slaughter - sold for roughly £671 on October 9.
However, Fast forward to today, and that same knife sold for as low as £222. That's because of the update. You can now trade up five covert rarity skins for a knife, which has suddenly increased the supply of knives on the market, thus leading to a sudden drop in price across the board for knives.
As a result, on a macro level, the entire Counter Strike 2 skin market cap has dropped by 28.11 percent according to CS2 market analytics website Price Empire. In other words, that's almost $2bn in less than a week. All because Valve made acquiring certain cosmetics in its popular game easier.
So, that's a shocking figure, but is this a good thing? It certainly depends on what position you're in. If you're a normal player with a few cool skins, and have felt priced out of getting a knife skin due to the pricey market surrounding them, this is certainly a great update for you. It's not so great if you're someone who invested money into Counter Strike 2 cosmetics rather than, y'know, stocks, a savings account, etc. In fact, it's potentially devastating for people who decided to invest a chunk of their wealth into Counter Strike skins over the years.
So pour one out to the Counter Strike 2 players who have found their inventories drop by like 30% plus, and if you've got an old Counter Strike account you've not opened up in a while, why not boot the game back up and see if you can get a fancy knife!

99,2025-10-23,"A landmark case in the UK concerning Apple’s App Store practices has just been decided, with a London tribunal ruling against the company in a move that could cost Apple up to $2 billion.
Sam Tobin writes at Reuters:
Apple abused its dominant position by charging app developers unfair commissions, a London tribunal ruled on Thursday, in a blow which could leave the U.S. tech company on the hook for hundreds of millions of pounds in damages.
The Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) ruled against Apple after a trial of the lawsuit, which was brought on behalf of millions of iPhone and iPad users in the United Kingdom.
The CAT ruled that Apple had abused its dominant position from October 2015 until the end of 2020 by shutting out competition in the app distribution market and by “charging excessive and unfair prices” as commission to developers. […]
The case had been valued at around 1.5 billion pounds ($2 billion) by those who brought it. A hearing next month will decide how damages are calculated and Apple’s application for permission to appeal.
Apple has already said it will appeal the ruling, which the company said “takes a flawed view of the thriving and competitive app economy”.
The estimated $2 billion in damages that might be enforced is expected to combine several different factors.
Per Reuters:
We will keep you posted on any further developments with the case, including Apple’s appeal and the actual damages when they are calculated next month.
