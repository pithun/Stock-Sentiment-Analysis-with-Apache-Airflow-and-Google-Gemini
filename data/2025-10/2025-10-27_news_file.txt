0,2025-10-27,"I talked to the scholars who literally wrote the book on tech bubbles—and applied their test.
AI may not simply be “a bubble,” or even an enormous bubble. It may be the ultimate bubble. What you might cook up in a lab if your aim was to engineer the Platonic ideal of a tech bubble. One bubble to burst them all. I’ll explain.
Since ChatGPT’s viral success in late 2022, which drove every company within spitting distance of Silicon Valley (and plenty beyond) to pivot to AI, the sense that a bubble is inflating has loomed large. There were headlines about it as early as May 2023. This fall, it became something like the prevailing wisdom. Financial analysts, independent research firms, tech skeptics, and even AI executives themselves agree: We’re dealing with some kind of AI bubble.
But as the bubble talk ratcheted up, I noticed few were analyzing precisely how AI is a bubble, what that really means, and what the implications are. After all, it’s not enough to say that speculation is rampant, which is clear enough, or even that there’s now 17 times as much investment in AI as there was in internet companies before the dotcom bust. Yes, we have unprecedented levels of market concentration; yes, on paper, Nvidia has been, at times, valued at almost as much as Canada’s entire economy. But it could, theoretically, still be the case that the world decides AI is worth all that investment.
What I wanted was a reliable, battle-tested means of evaluating and understanding the AI mania. This meant turning to the scholars who literally wrote the book on tech bubbles.

Sandra Upson channels the spirits of an entire generation of AI founders.
In 2019, economists Brent Goldfarb and David A. Kirsch of the University of Maryland published Bubbles and Crashes: The Boom and Bust of Technological Innovation. By examining some 58 historical examples, from electric lighting to aviation to the dotcom boom, Goldfarb and Kirsch develop a framework for determining whether a particular innovation led to a bubble. Plenty of technologies that went on to become major businesses, like lasers, freon, and FM radio, did not create bubbles. Others, like airplanes, transistors, and broadcast radio, very much did.
Where many economists view markets as the product of sound decisions made by purely rational actors—to the extent that some posit that bubbles don’t exist at all—Goldfarb and Kirsch contend that the story of what an innovation can do, how useful it will be, and how much money it stands to make creates the conditions for a market bubble. “Our work puts the role of narrative at center stage,” they write. “We cannot understand real economic outcomes without also understanding when the stories that influence decisions emerge.”
Goldfarb and Kirsch’s framework for evaluating tech bubbles considers four principal factors: the presence of uncertainty, pure plays, novice investors, and narratives around commercial innovations. The authors identify and evaluate the factors involved, and rank their historical examples on a scale of 0 to 8—8 being the most likely to predict a bubble.
As I began to apply the framework to generative AI, I reached out to Goldfarb and asked him to weigh in on where Silicon Valley’s latest craze stands in terms of its bubbledom, though I should note that these are my conclusions, not his, unless stated otherwise.
In 1895, the city of Austin, Texas, purchased 165-foot-tall “moonlight towers” and installed them in public hot spots. The towers were equipped with arc lighting, which burned carbon filaments. Spectators gathered to stare up in awe as ash rained down upon them.
With some technologies, Goldfarb says, the value is obvious from the start. Electric lighting “was so clearly useful, and you could immediately imagine, ‘Oh, I could have this in my house.’” Still, he and Kirsch write in the book, “as marvelous as electric light was, the American economy would spend the following five decades figuring out how to fully exploit electricity.”
“Most major technological innovations come into the world like electric arc lighting—wondrous, challenging, sometimes dangerous, always raw and imperfect,” Goldfarb and Kirsch write in Bubbles. “Inventors, entrepreneurs, investors, regulators, and customers struggle to figure out what the technology can do, how to organize its production and distribution and what people are willing to pay for it.”
Uncertainty, in other words, is the cornerstone of the tech bubble. Uncertainty over how the stories entrepreneurs tell about an innovation will translate into real business, which parts of a value chain it might replace, how many competitors will flock to the field, and how long it will take to come to fruition. And if uncertainty is the foundational element to a tech bubble, alarm bells are already ringing for AI. From the beginning, OpenAI’s Sam Altman has bet the house on building AGI, or artificial general intelligence—to the point where he once addressed a crowd of industry observers who asked him about OpenAI’s business model, and told them with a straight face that his plan is to build a general intelligence system and simply ask it how to make money. (He has since moved away from that bit, saying AGI is not “a super useful term.”) Meta is aiming for “superintelligence,” whatever that means. The goal posts keep on moving.
In the nearly three years since AI took center stage in Silicon Valley, the major players, with the exception of Nvidia, whose chips would likely still be in use post-bust, still haven’t demonstrated what their long-term AI business model will be. OpenAI, Anthropic, and the AI-embracing tech giants are burning through billions, inference costs haven’t fallen (those companies still lose money on nearly every user query), and the long-term viability of their enterprise programs are a big question mark at best. Is the product that will justify hundreds of billions in investment a search engine replacement? A social media substitute? Workplace automation? How will AI companies price in the costs of energy and computing, which are still sky-high? If copyright lawsuits don’t break their way, will they have to license their training data, and will they pass on that additional cost to consumers? A recent MIT study made waves—and helped stoke this most recent wave of bubble fears—with a finding that 95 percent of firms that adopted generative AI did not profit from the technology at all.

Who is Ed Zitron? What is Ed Zitron? How is Ed Zitron? Tommy Craggs profiles the man, the myth, the hater.
“Usually over time, uncertainty goes down,” Goldfarb says. People learn what’s working and what’s not. With AI, that hasn’t been the case. “What has happened in the last few months,” he says, “is that we've realized there is a jagged frontier, and some of the earliest claims about the effectiveness of AI have been mixed or not as great as initially claimed.” Goldfarb thinks the market is still underestimating the difficulty of integrating AI into organizations, and he’s not alone. “If we are underestimating this difficulty as a whole,” Goldfarb says, “then we will be more likely to have a bubble.”
AI’s closest historical analogue here may be not electric lighting but radio. When RCA started broadcasting in 1919, it was immediately clear that it had a powerful information technology on its hands. But less clear was how that would translate into business. “Would radio be a loss-leading marketing for department stores? A public service for broadcasting Sunday sermons? An ad-supported medium for entertainment?” the authors write. “All were possible. All were subjects of technological narratives.” As a result, radio turned into one of the biggest bubbles in history—peaking in 1929, before losing 97 percent of its value in the crash. This wasn’t an incidental sector; RCA was, along with Ford Motor Company, the most high-traded stock on the market. It was, as The New Yorker recently wrote, “the Nvidia of its day.”
Why is Toyota valued at $273 billion while Tesla is worth $1.5 trillion to investors—when Toyota shipped more cars than Tesla last year, and brought in three times as much revenue? The answer is tied to Tesla’s status as a “pure-play” investment in electric (and to a lesser extent, autonomous) cars. In the 2010s, Elon Musk harnessed all the exciting uncertainty around EVs to tell a story about a future free of internal combustion engines that was so alluring that investors were willing to bet enormously on a volatile startup over proven workhorses. A pure play company is one whose fate is bound to a particular innovation panning out, about which entrepreneurs might tell more exciting and fantastic stories, and you need them for a bubble to inflate. They’re the vehicle through which narratives turn into material bets.
So far this year, according to Silicon Valley Bank, 58 percent of all VC investment has gone to AI companies. There aren’t a ton of obvious pure-play investments available to retail investors—another criteria for pumping up a bubble—but there are some big ones. Nvidia is at the top of the list, having staked its future on building chips for AI firms, and becoming the first $4 trillion company in history in the process. When a sector is seeing a lot of pure plays, according to Goldfarb and Kirsch’s framework, it’s more likely to overheat and have a bubble. SoftBank has plans to sink tens of billions of dollars into OpenAI, the purest AI play there is, though it’s not yet open to retail investments. (If and when it finally is, analysts speculate that OpenAI may become the first trillion-dollar IPO.) Investors have also backed pure-play companies such as Perplexity (now valued at $20 billion) and CoreWeave ($61 billion market cap). In the case of AI, these pure-play investments are especially worrying, because the biggest companies are increasingly bound up with one another. Nvidia just announced a $100 billion proposed investment in OpenAI, which in turn relies on Nvidia’s chips. OpenAI relies on Microsoft’s computing power, the result of a $10 billion partnership, and Microsoft, in turn, needs on OpenAI’s AI models.
“The big question is how much of that is in the private markets, and how much of that is in the public markets?” Goldfarb says. If most of the money is in private markets, then it’s mostly private investors who would lose their shirts in a crash. If it’s mostly in public markets, such as stocks and mutual funds, then the crash would bleed regular people’s pensions and 401(k)s. And guess what: It’s increasingly creeping into public markets. (Many market watchers have also been pointing to the rise of private credit as an increasing source of systemic risk, as more small investors have been able to dump their money into opaque deals over the past year.) Either way, the sums are huge. As of late summer 2025, Nvidia accounts for about 8 percent of the value of the entire stock market.
Twenty-five years ago, on March 10, 2000, the stock market hit a milestone: The tech-heavy Nasdaq reached a then-high of 5,132 units. At the time it appeared to merely be continuing its rapid ascent—it had risen an astonishing 86 percent in the previous year alone—buoyed by an investor gold rush for internet companies like eToys, CDNow, Amazon, and, yes, Pets.com.
Today, hordes of novice retail investors are pumping money into AI through E-Trade and their Robinhood app. In 2024, Nvidia was the single most-bought equity by retail traders, who plowed nearly $30 billion into the chipmaker that year. And AI-interested retail investors are similarly flocking to other big tech stocks like Microsoft, Meta, and Google.
Most of the investment thus far is fueled by institutional investors, but along with Nvidia and the giants, more pure-play—and more risky—AI startups like CoreWeave are going public or preparing to go public. CoreWeave’s March IPO was initially seen as lackluster, but it’s been on the rise since, as another way for retail investors to push money into AI.
As Goldfarb points out, everyone is something of a novice investor when it comes to AI, because it’s such a new field and technology, because there’s so much uncertainty, because no one knows how it’s going to play out. What makes today different from 100 years ago, Goldfarb and Kirsch note in the book, is that anyone can get in on the action. A hundred years ago, stocks were simply too expensive for most working people to buy, which sharply limited the capacity to inflate bubbles (though that didn’t stop the Depression from happening). Now there are stocks of every size and stripe available to purchase with a tap on a Robinhood app; and with the casino-ification of the economy, the breakdown of a meaningful regulatory apparatus to rein in all of the above—well, it has all come just in time to give novice investors a vehicle to sink their savings into the vague promise of superintelligence.
In 1927, Charles Lindbergh flew the first solo nonstop transatlantic flight from New York to Paris. The aviation industry had been underwritten by government subsidies for a quarter of a century by then, but the flight made news around the world. It was the biggest tech demo of the day, and it became an enormous, ChatGPT-launch-level coordinating event—a signal to investors to pour money into the industry.

Imagine, with Paul Ford, a world where AI is hilariously, horrifically boring.
“Expert investors appreciated correctly the importance of airplanes and air travel,” Goldfarb and Kirsch write, but “the narrative of inevitability largely drowned out their caution. Technological uncertainty was framed as opportunity, not risk. The market overestimated how quickly the industry would achieve technological viability and profitability.”
As a result, the bubble burst in 1929—from its peak in May, aviation stocks dropped 96 percent by May 1932.
When it comes to AI, this inevitability narrative is probably the easiest and clearest one to mark as a huge affirmative on the bubble matrix. There’s no bigger narrative than the one AI industry leaders have been pushing since before the boom: AGI will soon be able to do just about anything a human can do, and will usher in an age of superpowerful technology the likes of which we can only begin to imagine. Jobs will be automated, industries transformed, cancer cured, climate change solved; AI will do quite literally everything. Add in the industry narrative that we have to “beat” China to AGI, and thus must not regulate AI at any cost, and you have even more fuel on the fire.
“Is this a good story?” Goldfarb says. “The answer is profoundly yes.”
What aviation would be good at—moving people from one place to another, much more quickly than was possible with cars, trains, or horses—was clear enough early on. This is what elevates AI bubbledom to another level: The promise of AI, to investors, is nearly infinite. It’s beyond uncertain. It’s unknowable. And we should note that AI arrived after much of a decade of near-zero interest rate policy that led Silicon Valley investors to place bets on companies with little to speak of when it came to business models, but boasting big narratives. Uber, the poster child startup of the era, founded in 2009, did not post a profitable year until 2023. And the AI narrative is ‘Uber for X’ on hallucinogenic steroids. Different parts of the AI story, whether it’s, say, ‘AI will cure cancer’ or ‘AI will automate all jobs’, appeal to investors and partners of every stripe, making it uniquely powerful in its bubble-inflating capacities. And so dangerous to the economy.
It’s worth reiterating that two of the closest analogs AI seems to have in tech bubble history are aviation and broadcast radio. Both were wrapped in high degrees of uncertainty and both were hyped with incredibly powerful coordinating narratives. Both were seized on by pure play companies seeking to capitalize on the new game-changing tech, and both were accessible to the retail investors of the day. Both helped inflate a bubble so big that when it burst, in 1929, it left us with the Great Depression.
So yes, Goldfarb says, AI has all the hallmarks of a bubble. “There’s no question,” he says. “It hits all the right notes.” Uncertainty? Check. Pure plays? Check. Novice investors? Check. A great narrative? Check. On that 0-to-8 scale, Goldfarb says, it’s an 8. Buyer beware.

Imagine this: Just as a new generation enters the job market, a crisis rocks the world and permanently alters the economic landscape, forcing the young people starting out on their career journeys to learn the new rules of a different era. For both millennials and members of Gen Z, that description may hit close to home. Both generations were smacked with global turmoil right as they were launching their careers.
For millennials like myself, there was the financial system's implosion in 2008. Our parents lost houses, we lost our college funds, and graduated into the worst job market in at least half a century.
For Gen Zers, it was a pandemic. COVID wrecked many of your college years, and sky-high inflation ate into your meager student budgets. Now, you're out in the real world, right as the pool of entry-level jobs starts to dry up, thanks to technological change, high interest rates, and chaotic tariff policy.
Every generation has its war stories from its formative years. Gen Xers had to process 9/11 and the bursting of the tech bubble. Baby boomers dealt with their own bout of inflation and painfully high interest rates in the 1970s. But the past two upheavals felt particularly burdensome for the young generations trying to stand on their own two feet for the first time.
Today, the burden is on Gen Z after a brutal handful of years for our wallets, and society in general. Forty-eight percent of Gen Zs don't feel financially secure, according to a Deloitte survey released in June 2025, and more than 80% said their financial futures and day-to-day finances add to their anxiety and stress.
Gen Z, I hear you. I've been you. And I know there's a way through.
In these uncertain times, I'm not here to pile on the ""brainrot young people"" tropes or to deliver half-baked advice on how to write an effective résumé using ChatGPT. Instead, I want to provide perspective based on what we've learned time and time again over history. The US economy has gone through its fair share of triumphs and challenges, and it can feel like the deck is stacked against those of you trying to strike out on your own. But with the right conditions and careful planning, there's no doubt that all you Gen Zers out there will eventually have your moment.
Let's get one thing straight, Gen Z: you're not crazy for feeling worried about your prospects. A pandemic, political instability, social media brain rot, and two stock market crashes. Oh, and the threat of AI taking over the world and stealing all of our jobs.
Amid all of this, we've endured an economy constantly out of balance thanks to an inflation jump not seen in four decades and the slow-motion contraction of the job market. That affordability crisis? It's absolutely a thing. There was a 17-month period between 2021 and 2023 in which paycheck growth didn't keep pace with the surge in prices. Those are just averages, too. We all know the pain of higher prices was felt more acutely depending on where you've worked and what you've purchased. Essentials like housing have become a much greater burden: Rent prices have grown faster than paychecks for much of the past 15 years, and the typical mortgage payment is almost double what it was before the pandemic.
These days, paychecks are outpacing inflation again — an environment in which American households and businesses tend to thrive. But now unemployment is nipping at our heels. Especially yours, Zoomers. If you're in your early 20s, your job market prospects have soured much more quickly than for older Americans. The unemployment rate for 20 to 24 year olds is 5.6 percentage points higher than for 25 to 54 year olds (often referred to as the prime age unemployment rate because it covers a large portion of workers) — a gap so wide it's rarely seen outside economic crises.
People have been quick to point fingers at AI taking your entry-level jobs, too. Perhaps the most dispiriting part, your prospective employers are heralding this new technology not as an economic catastrophe but as a long-term structural change in how the world works and a long-term barrier to gaining on-the-job experience. And then there's Wall Street's gaslighting. Sure, society feels like it's ripping at the seams, but the stock market is trading at record highs. The dissonance between markets and large chunks of the economy is striking. Put it all together, and a bunch of you are probably feeling like you can't get off the mat. Psychologically and financially.
I didn't go through the exact same experiences you did. My senior prom wasn't canceled over a deadly virus. I didn't graduate over Zoom, and my biggest worry on social media was trying to make a new friend's top 10 ranking on MySpace. But as a millennial who graduated from high school in the depths of the financial crisis, I've felt some of the same feelings you have — even if the circumstances were drastically different.
I wasn't in the unluckiest cohort of millennials, though I wouldn't say I had it easy. I graduated from college in May 2013, when the unemployment rate for 20- to 24-year-olds was 13% — down from a then-record high of 17% for the class of 2010, but well above the current young adult unemployment rate of around 9%. I was also too young to open a brokerage account in the depths of the crisis, so I wasn't scarred forever by the pain of losing huge sums of money. Many millennials were, though. My generation is notorious for missing out on some of the best years for the stock market in recent history, simply because we couldn't — or wouldn't — invest. Our cash holdings in early adulthood were significantly higher than our Gen X predecessors, and we're the generation that brought you a thick distrust of Wall Street.
Yet I was still burned by the nasty side of risk before I was even able to start investing. My mom lost her part-time accounting job at a homebuilder after it was revealed that her company had been swindling money from customers and subcontractors. My dad was an electrician, and his business suffered under the strain of the housing market meltdown. Back then, I swore I'd never start a business. A few years later, I was tossing my résumé to anyone who would listen because I knew I needed a job ASAP. I lucked out with a great first job in one of the world's best newsrooms — an opportunity that materialized from an internship. Many of my peers weren't as fortunate, but they eventually found jobs over time.
This is where I start to turn toward the sunnier news — and offer a bit of advice. Sometimes, time is all you need to heal an economic wound. You could certainly say that was true in the 2010s. Markets stopped falling, and the government stepped in to stem the economic bleeding. The unemployment rate for all ages slowly decreased over the decade, eventually reaching a 55-year low in 2019. Millennials finally felt confident enough to start investing in their 30s, catching the middle of one of the stock market's longest rallies in history — the S&P 500 nearly quadrupled from 2009 to 2020. Interest rates stayed near zero for most of the 2010s, opening the door for millennials to buy their first homes toward the end of the decade. Homeownership rates for Americans under 35 turned around in the summer of 2016, just as unemployment fell to 4% and 30-year mortgage rates reached 3.3%. And in the hot job-market days of 2022, paycheck growth for 16-24 year olds compared to all prime-age workers hit a 25-year high.
The comeback hasn't been perfect, though. Economic growth was sluggish and wages were anemic in the 2010s, which undoubtedly limited the pace of millennials' progress. Companies stopped investing in their businesses in favor of stock-boosting initiatives such as buybacks, which benefited investors more than workers. The 2010s were marked by rampant distrust of institutions, ultimately sowing the seeds for the instability we're witnessing. Millennials are still far behind Gen X and Baby Boomers in homeownership when calibrating for age, according to ApartmentList calculations of Census Bureau data.
It's easy for us older folk to step back and tell you to suck it up. Mountains of data tell us the economy ebbs and flows over time, and cycles of joy and pain are the heartbeat of the stock market. We all know words ring hollow when you're out of a job and financial stability feels unattainable.
But remember how cyclical the economy — and your fortune — can be. AI, like other technologies, may prove to be a boon for society rather than a downfall. Its cannibalization of entry-level jobs may be overstated. Sure, you could find some evidence of companies automating roles, but the slowdown in hiring looks to be more than in AI-concentrated fields. This looks more like your run-of-the-mill job market slump, something we've encountered plenty of times in history.
Economists are split on what's happening — and what comes next. Stanford researchers claim AI is already gobbling up entry-level jobs at a noticeable rate, while Yale Budget Lab analysts argue there's no evidence of this in employment and unemployment data. MIT researchers have found that a vast majority of AI implementations in businesses fail to generate profits, and a Harvard Business Review study found that AI output is actually harming worker productivity.
Everybody seems to be grasping for narratives, which appears to be a natural human response during a time of drastic change. Add in a revolutionary technology, and the noise is deafening. Right now — as it was in the late 1990s — it's hard to put a finger on what forces will prevail over the next decades. But if AI proves to be like every other technological breakthrough, it'll help us become better at our jobs and lead to lower unemployment. Yes, even if it takes years.
You can't just wait for the economic tide to pick you up, though. If we really are coming under AI's technological grip, you'll want to focus on skills that humanize you. Become a commodity in an increasingly homogenous world. Focus on empathy, communication, and strategy to set yourself apart. On the financial side, learn to be an owner, not an employee. While you initially need to make money to have money, the days of climbing the corporate ladder are long gone.
Take the last five years. The average worker's paycheck grew by 5% each year, slightly faster than the 4% growth in prices. But if you invested in a hypothetical, no-fee S&P 500 fund, you would've made 15% annual returns on your money.
This isn't a call to quit your job and become a day trader. But it is a sign of how much owners have been rewarded by technology's boon to profits and corporate America's changing incentives.
In this age of AI and rampant automation, wage growth could keep losing ground to capital appreciation, and ownership becomes even more important for your path to wealth. Especially if you think a robot could take your job.
Humans are incredibly resilient, and so far, Americans have always dug themselves out of challenging times.

The ""Google Guys"" have got their groove back.
Larry Page and Sergey Brin are the world's second- and third-biggest wealth gainers this year as of Friday's close, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows.
The Alphabet cofounders have respectively grown $58.5 billion and $53.8 billion richer in just under 10 months, outpacing Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's $52.5 billion gain and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's $47.4 billion gain. The pair only trail Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison's $151 billion increase.
Page and Brin are now worth $227 billion and $212 billion each, ranking them fifth and sixth on Bloomberg's rich list — not far behind Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in fourth with a $247 billion fortune.
They hold significant leads over the rest of the top 10: LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault, former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, Huang, and PC pioneer Michael Dell have net worths between $150 billion and $200 billion.
Page and Brin are worth a combined $439 billion, a figure that rivals the $451 billion fortune of the planet's richest person, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. Their joint fortune also exceeds the market capitalizations of some of America's biggest and best-known companies, including Costco at $413 billion and Bank of America at $385 billion.
Google's creators have seen a sharp upturn in their fortunes since the summer. In late July, Page and Brin had gained less than $5 billion each since the start of the year, putting their net worths at around $170 billion and $160 billion respectively.
They've both grown over $50 billion richer since then, thanks to Alphabet stock surging 35% in the past three months to record highs of above $260 a share. Page and Brin each own around 6% of the $3.1 trillion conglomerate, which counts Google, YouTube, Waymo, and DeepMind among its businesses.
Alphabet shares surged in September after a federal judge ruled in an antitrust case that Google wouldn't have to sell its Chrome browser or Android operating system, removing a major overhang from the stock. Alphabet shares also jumped last week after the company struck a huge deal with Anthropic, assuaging fears it could become an also-ran in the AI race.
Buzzy partnerships, multibillion-dollar contracts, and forecasts of rapid growth have spurred investors to bet big on AI giants such as Oracle and Nvidia, driving up their stock prices and enriching their largest shareholders. Alphabet's Page and Brin are the latest beneficiaries of the boom.

The right speaker can bring life to any party, and even make those weekend solo sessions way more enjoyable. But you donât have to spend big to get quality, room-filling sound paired with a solid battery life. If youâre in the market for a good Bluetooth speaker that doesnât cost an arm and a leg, weâve got good news.
The Anker Soundcore 2 portable Bluetooth speaker is now down to just $28 on Amazon, after a massive 38% discount. This deal only applies to the Black color, but some other options are discounted as well. Just note that the discount is a limited-time one, so we recommend acting fast to grab it. The retailer might be pushing the price back up sooner than you think!

The build is truly portable and comes with a basic, no-fuss design. Youâll find all the controls at the top, so getting the party started is fairly simple. Youâre getting dual 6W neodymium drivers that blast rich sound that captures all the highs and lows well. The BassUp technology offers more depth at all volume levels. You can crank it all the way up or keep it low-key for a self-care night. Either way, youâll get clear sound without distortion.
The Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity offers a stable 66-foot range, which translates into clearer sound even when youâre not super close to the speaker. Prefer keeping things wired? Thereâs a built-in AUX port for plugging your devices. The battery life is just as solid; youâre looking at about 24 hours of playtime on a single charge. For reference, thatâs going roughly 500 songs without worrying about plugging it in. Everyoneâs favorite playlists get a chance!
The speaker is also rated for IPX7 waterproof, so it can handle a few splashes and light rain easily. You can take it to the beach, hang by the pool, or even bring it into the bathroom for a private shower concert. It also supports wireless stereo pairing, meaning you can pair two of these for bigger, wider sound if youâre planning to host larger gatherings.
All things considered, this is a great speaker for anyone looking to boost sound on a budget. Itâs compact and easy to carry, plus it offers superior sound. Anker has made it outdoor-friendly, so it can handle dust and water quite well. Itâs down to just $28 right now, and definitely worth grabbing while the dealâs still live.

7,2025-10-27,"When the AI bubble bursts, the nerds will do their best work.
Suddenly, and not long ago, our dearest tech industry leaders began to suggest caution. Sam Altman said that AI is in a bubble “for sure,” albeit one formed around “a kernel of truth.” Mark Zuckerberg said an AI bubble “is quite possible,” though “if the models keep on growing in capability year over year and demand keeps growing, then maybe there is no collapse, or something.” Even Eric Schmidt is saying to calm down about artificial general intelligence and focus on competing with China.

Whatever you do, don’t ask Katie Drummond if AI can report the news.
The question everyone wants an answer to is: How will the bubble pop? Will we wake up and realize that we don’t really want to talk to LLMs anymore? Will someone find a way to build AI tools at one-thousandth the price, letting a thousand ChatGPTs bloom? Are we going to check the news one day and see those photos of stock traders yelling to each other on the floor of the exchange as tech companies’ stock prices blink bright red? My answer is: I have no earthly idea. But I really, really hope that, someday soon, AI becomes … normal.
I love normal technologies. They come with manuals. They change periodically, but you can build craft and professional skills around them. Bubble technologies change constantly, and there is always a threat that they will either destroy society (bad) or make everyone besides you wealthy (worse). There are many ways to forecast when a technology is becoming normal—price-to-earnings ratios and other boring stuff. The metric I use is the C/B ratio: conferences to blogging. If people are steadily attending conferences about a subject, it is not normal yet. If they’re mostly blogging about it, it is. I made this up, but I assure you it’s predictive.
I work with AI all day long, and right now there are so, so many conferences and gatherings and not that many good, boring technical blog posts. The tech industry loves conferences, because our product is so abstract that it’s hard for us to figure out where we sit in the nerd-chimp hierarchy. This is why VC firms are so often sponsoring get-togethers; they allow for pheromonal exchanges and dominance displays, usually enacted with PowerPoint. Invoke the Chatham House Rule if you’re feeling naughty.
People sometimes talk about the golden age of blogging but less about why people blogged: No one had money, and nothing is cheaper than putting words online. When the money flies to money heaven, and the startups become enddowns, the conference budgets are often the first thing to go. Nerds still want to talk their nerd talk, though. That’s when they start posting—it’s the only way to figure out who you are. Eventually, AI’s C/B ratio will start to tip blogward.
Not yet, though. We may have a ways to go. The globalized economy has become, out of expedience and greed, a world-spanning suspension bridge, hung off a few giant anchorages like OpenAI and Nvidia and Google, bolstered by promises of planetary AI transformation—and if one of those anchorages were to falter, just a little, and the promises fail to materialize, maybe the cable would sag and the whole bridge would crumble, and all the AI startups (including mine) would fall into the sea. Constantly anticipating this is just one of the many things that has made 2025 so fun.
I know I should dread this. But maybe when the crash comes it’ll look like the dotcom crash: A Pets.com or two gets razed to the ground, but the new infrastructure remains, and we humans spend years—decades—weaving it into our systems. I was there for the dotcom crash. I could barely make rent, but it was delightful. I attended tech salons at people’s apartments. The price of admission was a six-pack. I switched to Linux and no one cared. I blogged day and night, as free as a bee. All I could do was read O’Reilly books, learn to code, and hang with friends. What a slice of heaven. And tech became less magical—more normal, more boring. Not driving culture, but reflecting it.
What will it be like when AI is normal and boring? Well, the magic show will be over. You won’t have those moments of awe and wonder, like when ChatGPT told you dogs in Slovenia can talk, or Dall-E showed you your first sexy Pikachu. Yes, giant companies will continue to have the biggest and best AI, and they’ll still use it primarily to enhance the shopping experience and sell banner ads frictionlessly. And yes, we’ll continue to see tons of glazed AI-generated videos showing large-breasted human-cat hybrids abandoning their crying kittens. I’m sure we’ll see tremendous advancements in breast generation.

Brian Merchant consults the tea leaves (and tech historians) for hype levels.
But then there’s everything else. We nerds have to learn how to teach people about LLMs, about how to put guardrails on AI projects and not just count on OpenAI to do it for us. We’ll have to ship products, and make smarter chatbots, and help people use these tools in good ways, even as other people are using ChatGPT to automate their dating lives. We’ll have to figure out where vibe coding is good and where it’s dangerous. And we’ll have to do it all while the world melts, both cognitively and glacier-ly, knowing that AI is contributing to that melt. On one side you’ve got these new human-impersonating machines that spew words, images, videos, and sounds by the millions per minute, and on the other you’ve got 8 billion agitated primates with access to weapons. The entire human commons is about to become a Superfund site, and the people who made the mess will move on to quantum computing. Once the frenzy fades, there’s just going to be a lot to do, and less sovereign wealth with which to do it.
Nobody with a mutual fund is likely looking forward to that day, and people without mutual funds definitely aren't. But, in one way, I am. Because it’s when the real nerds can come out. These are the nerds who love the tech, who hack around on the weekends. But since there are no conferences, and no one else wants to hear about it, they start a little newsletter—not a “10 important links” newsletter but a “10 extremely long paragraphs on obscure subjects” newsletter—or jump on open source projects and start fighting among themselves, which is one of the greatest forms of entertainment. I have hope and faith in weirdos doing weirdo things. I want to see people use AI to create new human languages and then start speaking them with their friends, or figure out how to run an LLM on a digital greeting card. I hope people share what they learn as they go. When the bubble is big, every idea feels like a billion-dollar idea. I yearn for cheap ideas from strangers.
I’ve felt so alienated from tech over the past couple of years. Part of it is the craven authoritarianism. It dampens the mood. But another part is the monolithic narrative—the fact that we live in a world where there seem to be only a few companies, only a few stories going at any time, and everything reduces to politics. God, please let it end. Give me glut, give me mess, give me a million incomplete open source projects and a billion Saturday-night blog posts about how to play with these toys. Lord, fill my feed reader. People often wonder how to get back to the vibes of the early, heady days of the internet. It’s easy: Crash the global economy and leave lots of young people with keyboards and spare time. Make it boring. That’s what’s interesting.
The good news is that right now I think we’re on our way. After AI is normal, a few conferences will go on, of course—often scruffier, in lesser venues. It’ll still be a huge industry, just not the only industry. People will still have the same light in their eyes. They’ll stand up with their undesigned, clunky decks, and say: Look what I made! And it’s not money.

Google’s latest AI feature, Voice Translate, has officially gone live for some Pixel 10 users in The Netherlands. The feature quietly started rolling out this week, with a Pixel 10 Pro owner reporting on Reddit that they can now enable Voice Translate during a phone call.
Voice Translate is one of the standout features introduced with the Pixel 10 series, powered by the new Tensor G5 chip. What sets it apart from previous translation tools is how it works seamlessly during live phone calls. When enabled, the feature listens to your voice, translates what you say into the recipient’s language, and then reproduces it in your own voice.
The person on the other end doesn’t need a Pixel — they simply hear your translated message naturally, as if you were speaking their language. At the same time, you hear their translated response in your language, creating a surprisingly fluid two-way conversation.
All of this happens on-device, meaning translations don’t rely on Google’s servers or an internet connection. The translation models are processed locally through Tensor G5’s AI cores, which keeps the process private, fast, and secure. This also means no call audio or transcripts are uploaded or stored in the cloud.
Once activated, users can manually select their preferred languages, download necessary language packs, and start using Voice Translate by tapping the “Call Assist” button during a call.
While users in the Netherlands seem to be among the first to receive the feature, German Pixel 10 owners have yet to see it appear in their settings. Oddly enough, Google's support page for the feature lists German as one of the official languages supported, alongside French, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish.
Several users in Germany have confirmed on Reddit that Voice Translate remains missing. Some speculate that this may be due to Google’s gradual rollout across Europe. It’s not uncommon for Google to roll out experimental AI features in phases, especially when dealing with voice-based technologies that must comply with local regulations.

The move: Qualcomm stock surged Monday, rising 22% to a high of $205.55. The stock is up 23% year-to-date. 
Why: Qualcomm announced that it will roll out a new line of products built for the AI data center boom.
In a statement released on Monday, it said the AI200 and AI250 accelerator cards, specialized chips designed to help AI systems operate with more efficiency, would arrive in 2026. The product lineup also includes new server racks for AI data center processing.
Qualcomm highlighted the abilities of the A1200 as a powerful chip with the ability to help tech companies deliver stronger results from both large-language and multimodal models at low cost.
The company is optimistic that its new technology will integrate into the growing AI infrastructure market, helping companies scale their operations
""Our rich software stack and open ecosystem support make it easier than ever for developers and enterprises to integrate, manage, and scale already trained AI models on our optimized AI inference solutions,"" stated Durga Malladi, Qualcomm's senior vice president and general manager.
What it means: After lagging behind more prominent chipmakers such as Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, Qualcomm will finally be in a position to compete with its much larger peers.
The announcement of its new AI hardware comes at a time when multimodal models that can understand video and audio commands as well as text are in full focus. 
Qualcomm's new chips and racks could prove pivotal in the AI boom's next phase, particularly if they can deliver on the company's promise of delivering the low total cost touted in its announcement.
OpenAI recently illustrated the growing demand for multimodal models when it rolled out its new Sora app, a text-to-video platform that quickly rocketed to the top of the Apple App Store, overtaking both ChatGPT and Google Gemini.
Qualcomm may be in a position to benefit from the soaring demand for chips that can help power new models. For investors, this also means that between Qualcomm, AMD, Nvidia, and Broadcom, the roster of AI hardware makers has steadily broadened after a period of Nvidia dominating the space.

Jonathan Tobias likes his job in tech, in part because it allows him to work remotely.
Signing on from home means it's only a five-minute walk from his Brooklyn apartment to day care pickup.
""I'm definitely lucky,"" he told Business Insider.
Tobias, 39, also knows his employer's allowances are increasingly rare. After years of talking up flexibility and work-life balance, leaders across industries are taking a firmer approach — mandating office attendance, tightening performance metrics, and pushing AI-driven productivity.
""It's very much an employer-driven market, which allows for businesses to behave like this,"" said Alex Bouaziz, cofounder and CEO of the HR and payroll platform Deel, referring to measures like return-to-office orders.
Yet CEOs reasserting control could risk overstepping, corporate observers warn. Workers might be hugging their jobs now, but prioritizing control over trust could backfire by damaging morale, engagement, and, ultimately, retention, they say.
Many CEOs are ""demanding more"" from workers these days, Rajesh Namboothiry, senior vice president at the staffing firm ManpowerGroup, told Business Insider. That might mean asking people to work longer hours or clock in over the weekend.
""They're seeing this efficiency boost as a one-way,"" he said of CEOs.
Leaders know they can ""push the envelope"" a bit more, he said, because the labor market is tighter than only a few years ago, when both corporate veterans and job-hoppers could win big pay hikes. Now, Namboothiry said, some CEOs are saying, ""'OK, this is the new normal.'""
It makes sense that in a tighter labor market, CEOs can enact stricter rules. Yet Namboothiry said that driving too hard could further erode worker engagement, which is at its lowest level in more than a decade in the US, Gallup reports. Beyond that, there's a concern about workers quitting when the job market eventually gets stronger, he said.
Given the widespread economic uncertainty and the impact of AI, some leaders might argue that it's reasonable for CEOs to exert more control over their workforce, said Marlo Lyons, an executive coach and host of the podcast Work Unscripted.
""Employers are simply trying to regain predictability in an unpredictable world, using structure and technology as tools for control,"" she told Business Insider.
However, that control can come with a price. Employees who see their employer as ""unempathetic"" report greater rates of workplace toxicity and mental health issues, reports Businessolver. This can reduce productivity and increase instances of workers calling in sick, according to the employee benefits company.
""We tend to have a very strong memory for the things that have happened and the way we've been treated when times are tough,"" Dion Love, a labor market strategist at the research firm Gartner, told Business Insider.
Workers might also remember what their employers didn't do, such as helping train them to use AI. In a recent EY survey of about 400 US executives at large companies, only about one in four respondents said investing in their workers in the next few years was a primary concern.
Employers need to educate workers about AI, said Dan Kaplan, managing partner and head of the HR practice at the consulting firm ZRG. Otherwise, he told Business Insider, employees who worry that AI will take their jobs are likely to resist adopting it. ""You're afraid this is the enemy,"" Kaplan said, even as CEOs themselves embrace the technology.
Gartner's Love said that bosses who navigate this moment skillfully have a chance to ""flip the script"" in an employers' market by investing in workers and offering greater opportunities for employees for career development, for example.
While many employees might have little choice but to accept CEOs' stepped-up demands, some workers have a better chance at calling the shots. For in-demand talent, like machine learning specialists, there is still ""legit competition,"" said Matt Martin, CEO and cofounder of Clockwise, which uses AI to optimize workers' calendars.
He said that money flowing into AI firms could prompt some workers who are dissatisfied with their bosses' demands to consider joining these growing companies.
In-demand employees are also more likely to balk when companies mandate things like RTO — and flee for more flexible employment, Deel's Bouaziz said. That's benefited his remote-first company, he said.
When Tobias, the tech worker in Brooklyn, posts about corporate life on social media, he sometimes hears people say that pre-pandemic office norms, such as having little say over where you work, are a thing of the past.
Yet as more CEOs tighten the reins, he expects those days are making a comeback — at least at some companies. Workers early in their careers could feel the pressure the most, he suggests.
That ""could harden them and get them used to the corporate world — or it can eventually backfire,"" Tobias said.

Lenovo’s official website rarely offers meaningful discounts, and finding premium laptops marked down more than 20% feels like winning a small lottery. The real clearance action happens on Amazon, where manufacturers quietly offload inventory at prices that make you question if there’s a typo. The Lenovo Ideapad Slim 3 with an Intel Core i7-13620H processor, 40GB DDR5 RAM, and 1TB PCIe SSD has crashed to an all-time low of $799 on Amazon, down from its typical $2,999 price tag. That’s a staggering $2,200 discount and a massive 73% savings that transforms a high-end business laptop into something accessible for students.
See at Amazon
The Intel Core i7-13620H is the 13th generation Intel processor which is a hybrid model that comes with 10 cores: 6 performance cores and 4 efficiency cores. The processor has the efficiency cores perform simple tasks in the background so that actual tough tasks requiring processing are attended by the performance cores for both speed and smooth functioning when using the CPU. The performance cores operate at a speed of 2.4 GHz, boosting to 4.9 GHz when additional processing is needed for activities such as video processing or calculations involving numerous formulas in a Microsoft Office sheet.
The 16 threads through its 10 cores allow it to run multiple apps at once without causing the system to come to a standstill. Open your Chrome browser with 30 tabs, use your Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Slack, Spotify and other apps running in the background, and still, it will respond better than budget-friendly systems that only come with a dual-core or quad-core processor. The 24MB cache helps it access frequently used resources without having to wait for the systemâs storage for that access.
Memory configuration makes a substantial difference in real-world performance, and 40GB DDR5 RAM puts this laptop in workstation territory. DDR5 represents the newest memory standard with significantly higher bandwidth than DDR4 and allows faster data transfer between RAM and the processor. This capacity handles memory-intensive workflows like running multiple virtual machines for software development, editing 4K video footage with effects layers, working with large datasets in Excel or data analysis software or keeping dozens of browser tabs active without performance degradation
The 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD has more than enough storage for operating systems and files, besides offering read transfers at a rate of 3,500 MB/sec and write transfers at a rate of 3,000 MB/sec on average for PCIe v3.x speeds. This results in Windows launching in a few seconds, applications launching almost instantly, and the time for file transfers being dramatically faster than hard drives or SATA SSDs.
The display has a 15.3-inch screen with a resolution of 1920×1200 pixels. The added vertical resolution (when compared to 1920×1080 Full HD) is beneficial for professionals like programmers or document writers, where every pixel matters. The display employs an IPS display type that boasts excellent viewing angles and color accuracy regardless of the angle, and its 300-nit luminance helps it remain visible in brightly lit environs or near windows.
Connectivity also features contemporary standards, so that Wi-Fi 6 enables faster wireless throughput than its predecessor, Wi-Fi 5. The Bluetooth 5.2 standard takes care of wireless peripherals such as computer mice and headphones for greater range and lower latency. Connect options include requirements for everyday use, such as two USB-A jacks for connecting legacy accessories, a USB-C port that can provide Power Delivery for faster chargingÂ along with DisplayPort output for computer displays, an HDMI 1.4 output for presentations, a headphone jack, and access through SD-card slots that benefit photographers for camera transfers.
At $799 with a 4.5-star rating from nearly 1,000 buyers, this deal delivers specifications that typically cost $1,500-2,000 even on sale.

We all use multiple devices every day; for both work and play. Our phones keep us connected, laptops handle the typical 9-to-5, and tablets come in handy for some on-the-go productivity. But juggling chargers for everything? Thatâs where it can get messy.
Carrying separate blocks and wires for all your devices is inconvenient. Things get bulky fast, and thereâs no guarantee youâll find a spare outlet for each device when youâre not at home. The solution? An efficient, but safe-to-use multi-port charger that works well with a range of devices. The 3-port Anker Prime charger does a great job at that, and you can now grab it for just $110 on Amazon, after a nice $40 discount. The only catch? This deal is limited to Prime members. Non-Prime members can still get it at the regular price of $150, or wait it out for another future drop.
See at Amazon
Youâre getting three charging ports and a total output of 160W. It can deliver up to 140W from a single port, which is great for power-hungry devices like MacBooks. When using all three, the power gets split up depending on the devices youâre juicing up. For example, it can deliver 70W + 70W + 20W when youâre charging two laptops at once, or 100W + 30W + 30W if you want to prioritize one main device, while also powering two more.
Thereâs a smart display on top, which gives you an insight into exactly how much power is being delivered to each device in real time. For more custom modes, you can connect the charger to the Anker app via Bluetooth. It lets you customize your control, plus switch charging modes as per your needs.
Compactibility is impressive. It plays nicely with just about everything, including iPhones (12 through 17 Series), iPads, MacBooks, AirPods, Apple Watch, Samsung Galaxy phones, and even Steam Deck, ThinkPad X1, etc. And despite all this power, the charger stays compact and lightweight. Itâs no larger than an AirPods Pro case, meaning you can toss it into your backpack and carry it around without feeling like youâre carrying something heavy. ActiveShield 4.0 monitors temperature 120 times per second to prevent overheating, so safety wonât be a concern either.
Altogether, this efficient charger replaces three with one. It fits into your hand, and still packs enough power to juice all your essentials quickly at the same time.

Developer IQHQ made one of the hot real estate bets of the pandemic era when it acquired the triangular-shaped office building in Redwood City, California, for $164 million in late 2021.
The San Diego-based landlord planned to raze the property at 10 Twin Dolphin Drive and erect a trio of lab buildings on the 15-acre site catering to the life sciences sector. At the time, the industry was booming as it played a leading role in combating COVID.
IQHQ has put the property up for sale this month, the firm confirmed to Business Insider.
The offering is the latest sign of retreat in a once-soaring segment of the real estate market, as life sciences properties across the country face record vacancy rates and tenants in the sector struggle with funding challenges that could drag on for years.
""We routinely evaluate our portfolio for opportunities to recycle capital by selling land assets that may not be strategic to IQHQ at this point in time,"" an IQHQ spokeswoman said in a statement.
The sector's problems have also been reflected in the stock market, where shares of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, a large public life sciences real estate company, have tumbled from a record high of about $220 per share in late 2021 to roughly $80 today.
Chief among the ongoing disruptions is a pullback in federal research funding, which is critical to the ecosystems of startups that eventually fill commercial lab spaces. The National Institutes of Health, which doles out the majority of federal money to the life sciences sector, is running roughly $5 billion behind on grant awards this year compared to 2024, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Venture capital, another key source of funding for the industry, has also pulled back. Life sciences companies raised $24.9 billion in venture investment through September, putting 2025 on pace for the lowest venture haul since before the pandemic, according to PitchBook.
Compounding the situation is a building boom in recent years that has left the market oversupplied just as leasing activity has slowed.
""Cycles in the past, you might see dips in venture funding, but federal funding remains stable — or there might be record layoffs occurring, but venture funding and research funding remains high,"" said Travis McCready, the chair of the real estate services firm JLL's global life sciences advisory practice. ""This is the first cycle I can think of in my professional history where all of the black squirrel events are happening at the same time.""
The average vacancy rate for life sciences spaces in leading markets across the country has ballooned from 6.6% in 2022 to 27% today, according to JLL — a record level. That number exceeds the 22.5% average vacancy for office space nationally, according to JLL, an area of the commercial real estate market that has grabbed attention for its headwinds.
Unlike the office market, where new buildings are outperforming, brand-new labs have been a focal point of the brewing problems. Projects completed between 2022 and 2024 have a 48% vacancy rate, according to JLL, demonstrating how newly delivered real estate to the sector has been met with moribund demand.
Boston, the Bay Area, and San Diego, which are the top three life sciences markets, have been beset with once-unthinkable vacancies, in part, because they were magnets for new construction in the sector. About 51.7 million square feet of the roughly 70.8 million square feet of life sciences space built in the last five years in the US was erected in those three markets.
According to JLL, Boston and San Diego now have a 33% availability rate, a statistic that measures the total amount of space landlords are marketing to potential takers, and the Bay Area's availability rate is 35%.
Even incubators, collaborative and multi-tenanted spaces that are usually resilient to downturns because they cater to larger constellations of small users, have begun to feel the strain.
Louis Kassa, the CEO of the Baruch S. Blumberg Institute, which operates incubator spaces in Doylestown, Pennsylvania and Philadelphia, said the nonprofit has delayed plans to expand both facilities because of budding vacancies.
The space in Doylestown, called the Pennsylvania Biotechnology Center, has grown steadily since opening more than a decade ago to about 150,000 square feet today and has never had appreciable vacancy, Kassa said.
Now, about 16% of its lab space is empty, Kassa said, and it has delayed plans to enlarge the facility by about 38,000 square feet. In Philadelphia, it leases almost 100,000 square feet from the large landlord Brandywine Realty Trust at an office property known as Cira Center. That space, called B+labs, has also accrued vacancy and Kassa said the Blumberg Institute has similarly postponed plans to take another floor.
In Doylestown, Kassa said that four tenants had recently been denied Small Business Innovation Research, or SBIR, grants from the NIH, which is a division of the US Department of Health and Human Services.
""What's really ironic is the MAGA platform — and I don't want to get too political — is make America great again,"" Kassa said. ""Well, we are great in science. And what's going on this past year is basically been cutting the legs out from science. It's disheartening.""
Mike Carnes, vice president for emerging company development at NCBiotech, a state-sponsored life sciences support initiative in North Carolina, said that 10 startup companies in the state had been recently rejected for about $15 million in SBIR funds. In 2024, a total of $124.5 million in NIH funding was awarded in the state.
President Trump's executive budget, meanwhile, has proposed cutting NIH funding by 40%.
""The many decadeslong, stable partnership between the federal government and academia to reliably and continually advance science and scientific progress has really been interrupted in ways that we've not seen before,"" Heather Pierce, the senior director for science policy and regulatory counsel at the Association of American Medical Colleges, said.
She added that the research funding plays a large role in the health of the life sciences sector.
The ""seeds of the exploratory research that may eventually move to a commercial product,"" often come out of academic research funded by federal money, she said.
Venture capital has also pulled away from life sciences.
Kassa, the head of the Blumberg Institute, said that much of the venture capital flowing into life sciences was favoring larger, more established companies over speculative startups — a concerning sign for future life sciences space demand.
""There are some investments being done, but it's mostly larger rounds for more advanced companies and technologies,"" Kassa said.
In 2020, Spear Street Capital, a San Francisco-based real estate investor, purchased a 500,000-square-foot building at 705 Mt. Auburn Street in Watertown, Massachusetts — one of the nation's top biotech hubs — for about $300 million. The lab space has sat largely vacant ever since.
John Grassi, the CEO of Spear Street, said the ecosystem of smaller life sciences firms was a ""little engine driving things"" by taking space and incentivizing larger firms in the sector to follow suit.
He's now hoping the space can be ""converted to alternative uses,"" including the growing application of AI to life sciences functions or even drug manufacturing, he said.
He didn't want to specify exactly how he was planning to pivot his strategy for the property, but said he was optimistic.
""Hope springs eternal, correct?"" Grassi said.

Desktop towers eat up precious desk space, generate noise and cost more than they should. Mini PCs solve all three problems by delivering full Windows performance in a package smaller than a hardcover book. The GMKtec G10 with Windows 11 Pro pre-installed offers a compelling alternative to Apple’s Mac Mini if you need Windows instead of macOS: Amazon just dropped this 512GB mini PC to an all-time low of $189 instead of $299, and gives you real desktop power for less than a basic Chromebook.

The AMD Ryzen 5 3500U is driving the G10 and it is a 64-bit processor that features four cores and comes from AMDâs Zen+ architecture. This quad-core processor has a processing speed of 2.1 GHz and requires only a 15W thermal design power so that it is energy-friendly for use every day. This processor can further scale up to speeds of 3.7 GHz when it comes to single-threaded activity for smooth performance for users when it comes to web browsing, document processing, and video streaming.
The integrated Radeon Vega 8 has a processing speed of up to 1.2 GHz and uses the system memory along with the CPU. The unified memory allows for faster processing by avoiding the lag that comes when the CPU has to access different memories which makes it efficient for graphics processing. The Vega 8 processor has around 35 percent better graphics processing compared to Intel N-series, such as N100 or N150, used in entry-level mini-computers.
The GMKtec G10 is shipped with 16GB of DDR4 SDRAM running in dual-channel mode, and it has two 8GB SO-DIMMs installed. The use of dual-channel mode increases the bandwidth from the CPU to the Ram by two times that of the single-channel mode setup. Users can upgrade the RAM to a maximum of 64GB by replacing the two installed SO-DIMMs, although 16GB will suit any user. The computer comes preinstalled with a 512GB SSD drive and has a PCIe 3.0 connection for faster access.
This small enclosure is turned into a productivity powerhouse by its triple display support: The Radeon Vega 8 Graphics can handle a total of three 4K displays simultaneously using its HDMI 2.1 display port, display port, and USB-C display port. The maximum recommended resolution for each display support is 4K, and the refresh rate is 60Hz, ensuring that there are no motion or text artifacts. This feature is particularly beneficial for stock market professionals requiring simultaneous access to different market feeds, designers requiring access to images, and any user requiring maximum display space.
The 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet port provides speeds that reach up to 2500 Mbps, well over double that supported by 1 Gigabit, the average standard found on computer ports. This will provide faster access times for larger file transfers through your home network which makes it easier to stream video without buffering. The added boost offered by the faster connection will also shine when accessing NAS storage, servers or using home networking software tools like pfSense or Untangle.
Windows 11 Pro is installed and activatedÂ so thereâs no waiting around for activation codes. The Windows 11 Pro comes with various features, such as Remote Desktop, allowing connection to the mini PC from another computer, BitLocker, used for encryption to protect your files, and Hyper-V, used for creating virtual machines.
Make sure you don’t miss that deal, it’s one of the most affordable ways to get a decent Windows computer.

It's easy to see why celebrities and influencers find brand building alluring. In the most successful cases, it ends with a celebratory exit, a nine-figure check, and, for some, the title of billionaire.
But aspiring entrepreneurs, beware: The founder mindset is risky, and many creators walk away with almost nothing.
""Ninety-seven percent of creators and celebrities should not be launching their own brands,"" Scott Van den Berg, the founder of HotStart VC, which invests in influencer brands, told Business Insider. ""They don't have a strong enough audience to actually create a billion-dollar company.""
Despite this, many creators — including MrBeast and Emma Chamberlain — have chosen to start their own ventures in recent years. A typical formula goes like this: Launch a brand, use your following to help it blow up, and then hope to cash in on your equity when the company is sold or goes public.
The desire to own something, rather than promote other brands, stems from the ""creator anxiety"" of relying too heavily on advertising and brand deals to make money, said Eric Bogard, CEO of talent-firm UnderCurrent Management.
However, betting on yourself presents its own drawbacks. Take the example of Logan Paul and KSI, two big-name YouTubers who launched Prime Hydration three years ago. The brand skyrocketed to success in its first year, but has since floundered in some markets — and may provide a cautionary tale.
In looking back on our reporting on failed influencer businesses and conversations with industry insiders, a clear theme emerged: It's often better to skip founder mode. Savvy influencers can negotiate for short-term revenue via royalties or marketing commissions, and worry less about equity.
""The math you want to always be doing is, is this equity potentially worth 10 times more than what I would charge to post about it?"" Bogard said.
Bogard's advice is to opt for a healthy mix of equity and royalties.
Take his client Landon Bridges, a food influencer and comedian who launched a hot sauce brand called Lava Sauce in March.
While Bridges had some equity, his pay was more focused on a royalty for each bottle sold, Bogard said, who helped launch the hot sauce brand via UnderCurrent's product studio, Viral Goods.
So when Bridges said in April that he'd sold 600 bottles in 48 hours, propelling the product to the top 10 hot sauces on Amazon, he wasn't just celebrating a sales milestone — he was celebrating a payday.
The rollout of beverage brand Prime presents a clear case for why creators could be better off opting for some royalties over just equity.
The brand had a meteoric rise. In 2023, its first full year in operation, it generated $1.2 billion in sales, according to court documents. Grocery stores and bodegas couldn't keep it in stock, and a black market formed on playgrounds, with tweens reselling the colorful bottles at a profit.
If Paul and KSI had a deal like Bridges' one, they could have cashed in on the upside via 2023 royalties. Even a straight endorsement deal with some sponsored videos could have been a sizable payday.
But the creators went the founder route, opting for equity instead of royalties, two people with direct knowledge told Business Insider. KSI and his management team, Proper Loud, owned 25% of the company, one of them said.
It's possible that the cofounders were able to cash out a portion of their equity via a private sale, as some startup employees do with their stock options in private markets.
KSI, Paul, and representatives for Prime did not respond to requests for comment.
The strategy they employed had a huge potential payout. Owning a significant stake in Prime could pay off if the company went public or was acquired. But waiting for a financial outcome like that could take years, and it is certainly not a guarantee in the highly competitive beverage industry.
Meanwhile, Prime's initial momentum has fallen off.
While total revenues for 2024 are not public, Prime sales in the UK — a key market that, in 2023, represented more than 10% of the company's total — fell about 70% from £112 million (about $149 million) to £33 million (roughly $44 million), according to June filings.
Consumer interest in its brand has moderated, the company wrote. Last year, Prime was hit with a lawsuit from one of its suppliers that alleged sales were ""falling well below"" expectations due, in part, to a series of lawsuits and ""fading social media buzz.""
Once a brand loses its heat, the downward spiral often continues, as the influencers become less motivated to promote the product, Van den Berg said.
""Other things will come by that make them a lot more money directly, and then slowly these businesses die,"" Van den Berg said.
The celebrity brand graveyard is littered with once-promising companies that have gone south, from Arielle Charnas' Something Navy to Addison Rae's Item Beauty.
On the other end of the spectrum are sponsorship deals, which are the foundation of the influencer industry. In these deals, an influencer posts about a brand on Instagram or TikTok in exchange for a fee. They usually don't get any ownership in return.
Eighty-four percent of marketers said they work with creators on sponsored content compared to 16% for product collaborations, according to a July survey from the influencer-marketing firm Linqia.
The tactic isn't as sexy as launching a product, but it's reliably propped up the industry for years.
Then there's the middle path, which predates the age of the influencer. It's what made some of the most famous celebrity spokespeople, from Michael Jordan to George Foreman, so rich.
Groundbreaking for moving away from the low-risk, fixed-reward endorsement model — appear in a commercial, earn a check — these stars earned a cut of the sales they drove, whether it was a pair of Nike sneakers or an electric grill.
For many creators, a combination of these models may be the best bet.
""You want your partnerships that are paying you fees, and those keep the lights on,"" Bogard said. But if you're in a comfortable position with brand partnerships and other revenue, then you have the luxury to pursue being an entrepreneur and ""getting some equity in a company you really believe in,"" he said.
Look at Alix Earle's recent deal with soda brand Poppi. The TikTok star promoted the brand — posting content, shooting a commercial, and making her own flavor — in exchange for a fee and equity. That equity ended up being valuable when the brand was sold to Pepsi for almost $2 billion. But even if there hadn't been a deal, she would have earned something.

Amazon plans to cut as many as 30,000 corporate jobs starting Tuesday morning, according to a new report from Reuters that cites three unnamed people familiar with the matter.
Amazon has 1.5 million employees globally (1.2 million in the U.S.), but about 350,000 of those are corporate positions, according to Reuters. Cutting 30,000 corporate jobs represents almost 9% of Amazon’s total corporate positions.
The Reuters report cited overhiring from the pandemic as the impetus of the cuts, but not everyone seems convinced by that argument, given the fact that companies have had plenty of time to tinker with their staffing since the onset of covid in 2020. The last massive job cuts at Amazon saw 27,000 people let go in late 2022.
Analysts on CNBC debated what was behind the news on Monday, with two other likely culprits: the rise of AI and President Donald Trump’s extreme tariffs. There was strong debate for and against the case that the reported job cuts were coming due to AI, but nobody seems to really know yet. Amazon didn’t immediately respond to Gizmodo’s questions about the Reuters report emailed Monday.
The case of tariffs is easier to make, given the fact that President Trump has been so erratic in implementing them, slapping foreign goods with historically high import taxes. Just this weekend, Trump announced an additional 10% tariff on Canada because he was upset about an ad purchased on U.S. airwaves by the premier of Ontario that featured old footage of President Ronald Reagan warning against tariffs. Trump claimed the ad was AI-generated, which isn’t true.
The New York Times reported last week that Amazon has ambitious plans for robotics that will help it grow without expanding its workforce. The goal is to automate 75% of Amazon’s operations, according to the report, which could mean that it won’t have to hire 600,000 new workers it would’ve otherwise needed by 2033.
Automation has always caused job losses over the past century, whether it’s physical machines in factories or software that can improve the efficiency of white collar workers. But the hype around AI has created a new cycle in the 2020s that has everyone holding their breath. Will generative artificial intelligence prove to be a massive job killer, or will workers adapt to other positions, and things will become more efficient?
Nobody knows where it will go, obviously, even as many people predict that the AI bubble is about to burst. Anyone who knows how things will play out (and has some money to burn) has the potential to earn some big bucks in the weeks and months ahead. Some big names are reporting earnings this week, including Amazon (Thursday), Alphabet (Wednesday), and Microsoft (Wednesday).
Wall Street liked the news on Monday that Amazon was cutting jobs, as it often does. The stock closed up 1.25%. The DOW, S&P 500, and NASDAQ all closed at record highs.

20,2025-10-27,"Following another week of intensive and lethal Russian bombardment of Ukraine's cities, a composite image has been doing the rounds on Ukrainian social media.
Underneath an old, black-and-white photo of Londoners queuing at a fruit and vegetable stall surrounded by the bombed-out rubble of the Blitz, a second image - this time in colour - creates a striking juxtaposition.
Taken on Saturday, it shows shoppers thronging to similar stalls in a northern suburb of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, while a column of black smoke rises ominously in the background.
""Bombs can't stop markets,"" reads the caption linking the two images.
The night before, as the city's sleep was interrupted once again by the now all-too-familiar booms of missile and drone strikes, two people were killed and nine others injured.
The implication is clear. Rather than destroying public morale, Russia's dramatic ramping up of attacks on Ukrainian cities is conjuring a spirit of resilience reminiscent of 1940s Britain.
When I visited the market - with the black fumes still billowing from the missile strike on a nearby warehouse - that sense of fortitude was evident.
But there was plenty of fear, too.
Halyna, selling dried prunes and mushrooms, told me she saw little cause for optimism.
""In my opinion, according to the scriptures of the saints, this war hasn't even started yet.""
""It will get worse,"" she added. ""Way worse.""
A shopper who told me she had felt her house tremble from the force of the blast was still visibly shaken by the experience.
Inspiring memes about blitz-spirit are all very well, but for Ukraine the far bigger question is not how to endure this war, but how to stop it.
And with President Donald Trump proclaiming his powers as a peacemaker and pushing that question back to the centre of global politics, another term from that same period in history is once again looming large – 'appeasement'.
The question of whether Ukraine should fight against or negotiate with an aggressor has been there since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014.
But more than three years after it launched its full-scale invasion, the war is entering a new phase, and that word has re-entered the global debate.
On the battlefield, fighting has reached a brutal stalemate, and Russia is now increasingly targeting Ukrainian cities far from the front line.
Its aerial attacks – using ballistic missiles, explosive-laden drones and glide bombs – have gone from an average of a few dozen each day last year to nightly, and often run into the many hundreds.
What the Kremlin insists are ""military and quasi-military"" targets now regularly include Ukraine's civilian rail stations, passenger trains, gas and electricity supplies, and homes and businesses.
According to UN figures, almost 2,000 civilians have been killed this year, bringing the total since the start of the war to more than 14,000.
As well as the human toll, the financial burden is rising exponentially, with the cost of the air defence systems significantly higher than that of the waves of cheap drones being sent to overwhelm them.
Just over a week ago, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky set off for his meeting in Washington with President Donald Trump in optimistic mood.
The US, he believed, was running out of patience with Russia.
But he was wrong-footed by a surprise Trump-Putin phone call while en route, and subsequent talk of another summit between the two leaders in Budapest.
Zelensky's own exchange with Trump in the White House was reportedly a difficult one, with the US president once again repeating his old talking points.
Framing the conflict as little more than a fight between two men who didn't like each other, Trump insisted they needed to settle the war along the existing front line.
Warning of the risks of escalation, he also refused to grant Ukraine the use of the long-range Tomahawk missiles to strike deep into Russia.
Gregory Meeks, a senior Democrat on the US House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, called Trump's strategy ""weakness through appeasement"".
Meanwhile, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk wrote on X that ""appeasement never was a road to a just and lasting peace"".
Although the comments from the Ukrainian president were slightly more guarded – having learned the hard way not to criticise Trump too strongly – they implied the same meaning.
""Ukraine will never grant terrorists any bounty for their crimes, and we count on our partners to take the same position,"" Zelensky wrote on social media after arriving back in Kyiv. 
With Russia making it clear that it wasn't anything like as ready as the US president had hoped to end the fighting - vowing instead to advance on even more territory - the planned summit was put on ice.
Washington promptly sanctioned Russia's two biggest oil companies – a sign, perhaps, of growing impatience with Putin. 
While the economic impact to Russia is likely to be minimal, it represents a major shift in Trump's foreign policy, having previously said he would not impose sanctions until European nations ceased buying Russian oil.
Even if that is the case, it's clear that a large gulf remains between the US and European view of how to end the conflict.
It was on firmer ground that Zelensky found himself a few days later, meeting various European leaders in Brussels and later in London.
More sanctions packages were agreed and progress was made towards using Russia's own frozen assets to fund Ukraine's war aims, though ultimately no final agreement was struck.
Speaking alongside Zelensky in Downing Street on Friday, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer promised he would work with his European partners to help provide more long-range weapons to take the fight onto Russian territory.
With hindsight, it's easy to mock Britain's policy of appeasement during the 1930s. Indeed, some did so even then.
""You could always appease lions by throwing Christians to them,"" Harold Macmillan, a future prime minister and opponent of the policy, once said.
""But the Christians had another word for it.""
And yet we sometimes forget that the man most associated with the policy, then-prime minister Neville Chamberlain, enjoyed significant support from the US, which shared his deep fear of repeating the horrors of the World War One.
President Trump appears to harbour similar fears today.
The risk of a widening war with a nuclear armed state is not to be taken lightly, as Ukraine increases the effectiveness and frequency of its strikes on Russian oil depots and, in some instances, its power grid.
The Russian leader knows this, warning recently that the use of foreign supplied Tomahawks could prompt a response that was ""serious, if not staggering.""
But few Ukrainians I've spoken to this week have any doubt that the lesson of history holds true.
""Russia only stops when it's washed in its own blood,"" said Yevhen Mahda, a professor at Kyiv's National Aviation University.
""Ukraine has proven this. The sooner the West understands, the better for us all.""
At the market, surrounded by gourds and carrots grown in his own garden, Fedir said he had also been jolted awake by the power of the nearby missile strike.
""Putin understands only force,"" he said. ""We need to destroy their airfields and their factories that produce these shells, bombs and missiles.""
The greater risk, he suggested, lies in concessions, negotiations or appeasement – call it what you will – that, however well motivated, only serve to further embolden an authoritarian power.
""Does Europe think he will calm down after Ukraine,"" he asked. ""If he takes Ukraine, he'll carry on.""

Samsung is getting ready to take a big step with its hardware. After leading the foldable market with the Galaxy Z Fold and Z Flip, the company plans to reveal its first tri-fold smartphone later this week. But according to a recent rumor, the launch will be limited, and the U.S. probably won't get it right away.
The Korean tech giant is set to pull the wraps off the Galaxy Z TriFold at the APEC CEO Summit in South Korea, happening October 28–31. This launch marks the company’s jump into a completely new device category, featuring a dual-hinge setup that lets the phone fold twice.
The Galaxy Z TriFold will feature a dual-hinge in-folding design, meaning both sides fold inward toward the main display. When closed, the phone looks like a typical smartphone with a 6.5-inch cover display, but once unfolded in stages, it can expand to 8 inches and, fully opened, stretch to a massive 10-inch screen.
 



Early reports suggest Samsung has been refining the hinge durability and optimizing the display software to ensure seamless transitions between folded modes. Under the hood, the TriFold is rumored to run on last year’s Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset rather than Qualcomm’s latest processor.
The price will put this phone firmly in the ultra-premium range, with estimates around 4 million won, or about $2,780. To reduce risk, Samsung is reportedly limiting the first batch to about 50,000 units, which makes sense since this is still an experimental product.
Unfortunately for foldable enthusiasts -- and despite recent rumors to the contrary -- I think it's very unlikely that Samsung will release its first trifold beyond Korea, the greater Chinese market (including Singapore & Taiwan), & possibly the UAE. I'd love to be wrong, though.October 26, 2025
The biggest twist in the story? The Galaxy Z TriFold might not even make it to the United States, contrary to previous reports. Instead, it will debut in select regions, including South Korea, China, Singapore, Taiwan, and the UAE, as per reliable leaker Evan Blass on X.
The tri-fold concept is as ambitious as it is untested, and Samsung seems to be treating it as a high-end showcase instead of a product for everyone. As the company moves into this new area, people will be watching to see how the TriFold performs in real life, including its hinge strength, battery life, and how well Android works with the changing screen sizes.

Until just a few short weeks ago, the AirPods Pro 2 were Apple’s end-all, be-all wireless earbuds, with thousands of glowing reviews and millions of units sold. Now that the AirPods Pro 3 are officially on the market, the Pro 2 earbuds might have just morphed into something even better â a terrific buying opportunity, if this Amazon deal taking 32% off their price is any indication.
It’s not like the quality of the AirPods Pro 2 have taken a sudden turn for the worse. They still have the H2 chip at their core to create incredibly efficient noise cancellation, spatial audio with head motion detection, and the world’s first hearing test and FDA-cleared hearing aid features in consumer wireless earbuds. The only thing that’s changed in the couple of months since they were supplanted at the top of the Apple food chain is the price, which just got a lot more friendly.
See at Amazon
The H2 chip was a massive game-changer not just for the AirPods, but for the entire wireless earbud market. It literally doubled the noise cancellation power of the original AirPods Pro, and did so by increasing the number of times it analyzed external sounds to an incredible 48,000 per second. With that kind of noise-cancelling power, you can completely tune out the outside world and enjoy you playlists, podcasts, and audio books â a true luxury when you’re on a long flight or stuck in a crowded environment.
It’s also easy to let enough of the world back in to keep yourself aware of your surroundings by switching the AirPods Pro 2 into adaptive transparency mode, which is a wise personal-safety suggestion when you’re a pedestrian in a heavily trafficked area, or on a run or walk while alone.
Another innovative feature of the AirPods Pro 2 is the fit test, accessible in the Bluetooth settings of your iPhone or iPad. By playing different tones to determine the quality of the seal between your ear and the AirPods, you discover which of the four different sizes of silicon tips is the right one for you to enjoy your AirPods Pro 2 to the fullest.
One area where the fit of the AirPods Pro 2 just dramatically improved is your budget, thanks to this 32% off Amazon deal that makes the AirPods Pro 2 a truly outstanding buy at just $170. Perhaps we should be thanking the AirPods Pro 3 for dropping in time to make their legendary predecessors one of the better pre-Black Friday tech deals that we’ve seen.

That's not bad advice, but it's a bit simplistic, especially if you already have a mortgage.  A better answer is: it depends.

I just bought a house in March. Any listing where the home was already vacated (95% in my case) the listing was AI-augmented with furniture that would not exist when I went to tour the home.
This has nothing to do w/renting; it's everywhere.

 The real property is completely empty, and the luxury furniture is a product of virtual staging. I... don't care? I'm going to look at the house in person anyways. If they aren't staging it in real life, it isn't going to look great. It's nice seeing how it might look on a video, but that's not how anyone is going to make their final decision.

My concern is the opportunity to lie.An empty room is tough to gauge the size of (even in person).A staged room, with a bed and dresser gives you a better idea of how spacious or not spacious the room is, and how you might furnish it. This is valuable information when forming an opinion about the house and its suitability.
Realtor photos  already have a fisheye problem with a lot of the pictures and video as they trying to show more of the room at once which causes scale to be tough to determine.
Add AI staging to that and it is even more problematic, because they can stage it with furniture that isn't scaled correctly. I've seen some AI staging where things are just scaled wrong, like the bedroom dresser is only 4"" deep, and couches are sunk into walls. But its not obvious to look at it. Or there's two cars in the garage but they're 15% smaller than they'd actually be so it looks more spacious. OR there's two large couches with a large coffee table between them with a fireplace off to the side, and room to walk around it all and then you realize that either the fireplace is 8 feet high and 12 feet wide and the ceilings are 25' high ... or the furniture is scaled to 25% actual size.

I have a friend who recently sold their house and the agent staged it by having them take out about 80% of the furniture (and into storage) to make the house look even bigger.  What remained wasn't really practical for actual living, but I guess it offered enough for the imagination.  I had never seen the house look so bare.

I discovered a listing for a vacant lot where they had used AI to show what the lot would like if you were to build a house on it.  The listing helpfully stated ""House not included"".
No idea if the house they showed would have met zoning requirements in the area, and I doubt the listing agent did either.
I'm pretty sure we won't be able to avoid this in the next few years.
Glad I'll never be in the market for a home and that I have at least one realtor I trust available to me.
I don't think anyone assumes a house is furnished unless the listing explicitly states it's furnished. That isn't really scummy. That's just making it easier for you to see yourself in the house. What is scummy, though, are the listings where they use their little AI tool to materially alter the appearance of the run down crackhouse they bought at a state tax sale for $378 and flipping it completely untouched for $750,000 hoping you're one of those foreign investors that just wants to buy up some real estat 
I'll agree that it's fiction created by an AI (probably), but not that it's what it meant by slop.  Not unless it's very carelessly done.
What it *is* is AI generated deceptive advertising.

26,2025-10-27,"Update: An Apple spokesperson provided 9to5Mac with the following statement regarding today’s decision:
“We’re pleased the Court recognized the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate the alleged harm to consumers and decertified the class. We continue to invest significantly to make the App Store a safe and trusted place for users to discover apps and a great business opportunity for developers.”
Last year, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers gave the go-ahead to a class action accusing Apple of monopolizing the iPhone app market. Today, she reversed that decision. Here are the details.
This case is particularly complex, as some aspects of it date back to the release of the original iPhone. But in a nutshell, the overall argument should be very familiar at this point: Apple allegedly maintains a monopoly over iOS app distribution by forcing users to purchase apps exclusively through the App Store, leading to higher prices.
After years of procedural back-and-forth, including multiple motions, appeals, and the consolidation of overlapping antitrust complaints, the case ultimately landed before Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, who declined in 2022 to certify it as a class action.
Then, in 2024, she reversed her own decision, once the scope “was narrowed to include only Apple account holders who spent $10 or more on app or in-app content,” as Reuters reported at the time.
Today, however, she reversed her decision yet again, following Apple’s successful challenge to the plaintiffs’ damages model, which the company argued had multiple errors and was incapable of showing classwide harm.
From Reuters:
Rogers said the plaintiffs failed to provide a model “capable of reliably showing classwide injury and damages in one stroke” by matching Apple accounts to consumers, while limiting the number of “unharmed” consumers in the class.
She ruled after an expert hired by Apple found “alarming” errors in the plaintiffs’ model.
These included that named plaintiff Robert Pepper and supposed claimant “Rob Pepper” were different people despite sharing home addresses and credit card information.
They also included the lumping together of more than 40,000 payment records for people whose first name was “Kim,” but who otherwise had nothing in common.
When asked about today’s decision, a member of the plaintiffs’ legal team said they were “of course disappointed” and would review their next steps. Apple did not respond to Reuters’ request for comment.

When you buy a pair of glasses, it’s often not a matter of if, but when something happens to them. That “something” could be a lot of things, like leaving them at a bar, or a friend’s house, or literally anywhere that isn’t the glasses’ case or your pocket. But arguably just as bad as losing glasses is breaking them or scratching them. In most cases, that might mean a simple (if expensive and inconvenient) trip to an optician, but what if your glasses are smart?Â What if it’s not a lens you’re fixing but an entire geometric waveguide screen?
The answer to that question is that you’re kind of out of luck, at least if a recent teardown from iFixit is any indication. According to the repair mavens over there who recently tore down Meta’s Ray-Ban Display smart glasses, 2025’s hottest pair of screen-having smart glasses are basically impossible to fix. That’s not surprising for a lot of reasons. For one, the smart glasses use a lot of novel tech, particularly when it comes to the actual making of the glass in the lens.
According to iFixit, making the lenses requires stacking up “layers of coated glass,” then cutting them with a “diamond wire saw,” and then grinding them “very precisely.” It doesn’t take an engineer to fill in the gaps here; these are sophisticated lenses and not something that can be easily popped in and out at will. And things get especially complicated when you consider a screen has to be projected through them.
Meta’s Ray-Ban Display use a novel waveguide tech for the screen, called geometric waveguides, as opposed to the diffractive waveguide tech in other smart glasses. This type of waveguide tech is sharper and creates less of a halo glow effect in the lenses. More specifically, to cut down on those visual artifacts, the display in the Meta Ray-Ban Display use “tiny mirrors” that reflect light as opposed to splitting it. All of these choices combined make for really advanced smart glasses that feel leaps and bounds better than others on the market in terms of sharpness, brightness, and ease of use. The downside is, it also makes them expensive and difficult to repair.
Again, that’s not surprising when you’re buying a product in a nascent category, but if you’re spending $800 on a pair of smart glasses that can be easily scratched or broken (just like any pair of glasses can), you’d probably be more at ease knowing that you can go swap out a lens or other parts. But as iFixit writes in its teardown, “Donât expect your local optician to be able to replace a lens in these for you.”
For me, what’s even more of a bummer than the lenses is the fact that the battery seems to be difficult to replace, too, and maybe unnecessarily so. Meta uses a new battery this time around in the Meta Ray-Ban Display, which extends battery life to up to 8 hours by its estimation, but iFixit says copious use of glue and lack of clips in the plastic make it difficult to replace. And putting the arms back together, even if you manage to pry them apart, is a whole different story.
In case you’re wondering, the standard warranty for the Meta Ray-Ban Display is one year, and it covers defects in materials or manufacturing, but it doesn’t apply to damage that happens accidentally or inevitable wear and tear. So, I would be very careful to put the smart glasses back in their case, no matter how tempting it may be to slide them in your pocket or throw them in a purse.
On one hand, it’s a bummer to see that such an expensive gadget is so hard to repair, but until the infrastructure is built out to repair smart glasses, that’s just how it’s going to be. In Meta’s defense, I highly doubt other purveyors of smart glasses with screens in them will be much better. Most of them are based overseas in countries like China, which adds layers of difficulty in terms of coordinating and dealing with repairs through the manufacturer. For now, it looks like fixing your smart glasses just isn’t an option unless you consider spending $800 on a brand new pair when yours get damaged a “fix.”

 Arcade1Up Pac-Man Countercade 
 $150 
Amazon has dropped the price on the Arcade1Up Class of '81 Countercade to $150. This was the original price for the countertop arcade machine, but for the past few months the retailer has listed it for $168 more often than not. This combo Ms. Pac-Man and Galaga machine was restocked in late August after being sold out since last holiday season. At the end of September, Amazon restocked Arcade1Up's Pac-Man Countercade for $150; this model had been sold out since early April.
Both of these miniature cabinets include three preloaded Namco arcade classics, 7-inch, vertically oriented displays, and full-size arcade controls. Just like last year, we'd expect these budget-friendly machines to be popular this holiday season. The same can be said about Arcade1Up's new Classic Special Edition Arcade Cabinets themed around Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, and Mortal Kombat. This trio of standing arcade machines offers a more affordable alternative to Arcade1Up's Deluxe series.

Take a closer look at the Class of '81 and Pac-Man Countercades below. We've also included a roundup of all Arcade1Up machines in stock now, including the aforementioned Classic Special Editions, Deluxe Cabinets, Head-to-Head Tables, and more.
The Class of '81 Countercade has a 7-inch, vertically oriented LCD screen surrounded by Ms. Pac-Man artwork on the left and Galaga artwork on the right. Despite the compact form factor, Arcade1Up Countercades have full-size controls. This one has a red ball-top arcade stick, two yellow buttons, a red button, and switches for power and volume. The marquee, side panels, and control deck have Class of '81 art icons and logo art.
As mentioned, the machine has three arcade classics developed by Namco:
The full dimensions for the machine are 8.7 x 9.4 x 13.11 inches, and it only weighs 6.3 pounds. Though designed to be played on a flat surface like a desk or countertop, it's light enough to rest on your lap while you're on the couch. You don't even need to be near an outlet, because the Class of '81 Countercade can be powered by the included Micro-USB cable or four AA batteries (not included).
If you hate Micro-USB as much as we do, grab this charger kit with four AA batteries for $13. 
Unlike Class of '81, the Pac-Man Countercade has maintained its original $150 MSRP since it was first restocked about a month ago.
The Pac-Man Countercade originally launched last November. It has the same core design as Class of '81, just with a classic Pac-Man theme and a trio of Pac-Man games:
 
Arcade1Up's Countercades are solid little machines, but if you want the best countertop arcade, we'd highly recommend the Evercade Alpha Bartop Arcade. The Mega Man and Street Fighter editions are no longer available, but Blaze Entertainment is releasing an Evercade Alpha Taito Edition on November 12. Though substantially more expensive ($260), the Alpha is a higher-quality machine with 10 preloaded games and support for the massive Evercade cartridge library. Check out our Evercade Alpha review from last year to read more about the impressive arcade machine.

 $260 | Releases November 12 
The Classic Special Editions are throwbacks to Arcade1Up's early cabinets you'd see on display at your local Walmart and Target stores. Priced at $334, these 4-foot cabinets have 15.6-inch displays and 13 preloaded games. Adults who plan on using these cabinets should either purchase an adjustable barstool or the $59 riser that's sold separately. Even with the riser included, the Classic Special Editions are $393--roughly $100 to $200 less than the Deluxe Editions.
 Arcade1Up Classic Special Edition Arcade Cabinets 
 Ms. Pac-Man, Mortal Kombat, and Pac-Man Machines for $334. 
Arcade1Up's Deluxe Cabinets don't require a riser because they are typically 61 inches tall (just over 5 feet). Other upgraded features include 17-inch displays, light-up marquees, and faux coin doors on the front. Deluxe Cabinets usually retail from $500 to $600. As of October 27, there are a handful of $500 cabinets, including Golden Tee 3D, NBA Jam, and Class of '81. The $600 cabinets include the ones with light guns--Big Buck Hunter Pro and Terminator 2--or a racing wheel (The Fast & the Furious).
Arcade1Up recently launched a new Ms. Pac-Man machine in its Head-to-Head Arcade Table line. The table has a light-up control deck and joysticks/buttons on each side of the 17-inch LCD screen. The $600 Ms. Pac-Man Arcade Table comes with 12 games:

This special-edition system plays real Atari 2600 and 7800 cartridges and comes with a yellow wireless joystick and Pac-Man: Double Feature, a cart with a newly developed version of Pac-Man and the original 2600 release. Extra joysticks themed around the Ghost Gang are available to preorder separately, as are three additional Namco classics on cartridge, including Galaga and Dig Dug. The Atari 2600+ Pac-Man Edition launches October 31.

Oracle (ORCL) has stumbled before. It's stock plunged > 30% in span of less than 2 months in 2025, wiping out billions in market value, and erasing massive gains in single correction. If history is any guide, Oracle (ORCL) stock isn't immune to sudden, sharp downturns.
Cloud Market Share Lag: OCI's 3% market share (Q2 2025) trails AWS (30%), hindering long-term dominance despite OCI revenue growing 54% to $3.3B in Q1 FY26.
Specialized DB Erosion: Snowflake's $4.395B FY25 product revenue guidance and Databricks' $100B+ valuation show strong growth in specialized data platforms, challenging Oracle's 9.7% relational DB share.
Generative AI Race: The $62.72B GenAI market (2025) is fiercely competitive. Oracle's Q1 FY26 AI-driven RPO hit $455B, yet others innovate rapidly in AI-native platforms.
Single stock can be risky, but there is a huge value to a broader diversified approach. Strategic asset allocation and diversification helps you stay invested. Did you know investors who panicked out of the S&P in 2020 lost significant upside that followed? Trefis High Quality Portfolio and Empirical Asset Management's asset allocation approach are designed to reduce volatility so you can stay the course.
It certainly assists in managing risk if the fundamentals are strong. For more information on ORCL, read Buy or Sell ORCL Stock. Here are some significant numbers to consider.
*LTM: Last Twelve Months
When assessing the risks for Oracle, it becomes clear that even robust companies can suffer during market downturns. During the Dot-Com Bubble, ORCL dropped approximately 77%, which is considerable. The Global Financial Crisis caused its value to decline about 41%, and the Inflation Shock resulted in a similar 40% reduction. Even minor sell-offs like the 2018 Correction and the Covid Pandemic triggered declines of nearly 19% and 29%, respectively. Strong fundamentals are crucial, but when the market shifts, Oracle's historical performance indicates that it is not immune to significant losses.
The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a proven track record of consistently outperforming its benchmark that includes all three — the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. What is the reason? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered better returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; they provide a smoother investment journey, as illustrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics."

Eli Lilly (LLY) shares have surged by 16% over the last month and are currently priced at $825. U.S. pharmaceutical stocks have done well of late, as large drugmakers such as Pfizer and AstraZeneca signed drug pricing agreements with the Trump Administration to cut prescription drug prices and boost domestic manufacturing investments. 
This has raised hopes for a sustainable sector recovery, and there has been speculation that Eli Lilly might follow by signing a similar deal, supported by its commitment of over $50 billion toward domestic manufacturing expansion.
Our algorithm-driven multifactor analysis indicates that this may be the ideal moment to purchase additional shares of LLY stock. Overall, we maintain a favorable outlook on the stock, and a target price of $1074 seems achievable. We are convinced that there is not much to fear in LLY stock considering its solid Very Strong operational performance and financial health. Therefore, in spite of its Very High valuation, the stock appears Attractive but Volatile.
Here is our evaluation:
LLY stock has made notable gains recently and we find it appealing but unstable at this point. While this may seem like an opportunity, substantial risks exist in depending on a single stock. Conversely, there is significant advantage to a more diversified strategy, which we adopt with the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Trefis collaborates with Empirical Asset Management – a wealth management firm based in the Boston area – whose asset allocation methods yielded positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P experienced a decline of over 40%. Empirical has integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio into this asset allocation strategy to deliver clients improved returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; providing a smoother experience, as reflected in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
Let’s examine the details of each of the evaluated factors, but first for a brief background: With $741 Bil in market capitalization, Eli Lilly offers pharmaceuticals globally, focusing on treatments for cancers, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and associated autoimmune disorders.
[1] Valuation Appears Very High
This table emphasizes how LLY is valued against the broader market. For additional information, see: LLY Valuation Ratios
 
[2] Growth Is Very Strong
This table illustrates how LLY is growing relative to the broader market. For further insights, see: LLY Revenue Comparison
[3] Profitability Appears Very Strong
This table showcases how LLY's profitability compares to the broader market. For further details see: LLY Operating Income Comparison
[4] Financial Stability Looks Strong
[5] Downturn Resilience Is Strong
LLY has demonstrated greater resilience than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. We evaluate this based on both (a) the extent of the stock's decline and (b) the speed of its recovery.
2022 Inflation Shock
2020 Covid Pandemic
 
2008 Global Financial Crisis
 
The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has consistently outperformed its benchmark, which includes all three indices – S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; resulting in a more stable experience, as demonstrated by the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

33,2025-10-27,"The Samsung Galaxy A36 was designed for budget-conscious buyers.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

There's no shortage of cheap Android phone deals these days, and this next entry is an especially budget-friendly option. Right now, Best Buy will give you up to $140 off the already affordable Samsung Galaxy A36 5G when you have them connect it to your carrier for you, or $40 off if you prefer to do it yourself. This brings the price point down to just $260 with activation, marking a solid deal for anyone who prefers to buy their phone outright instead of utilizing a payment plan.
The Galaxy A36 was launched alongside the A26 and A56 earlier this year, with all three offering an economy price point for a few subtle downgrades. The A36 sports a decent-looking, 6.7-inch AMOLED display, and either 128GB or 256GB of storage—though this deal is for the base-level option.
The phone is available in colors dubbed Awesome Lime, Awesome Black, and Awesome Lavender, and they're all eligible for the discount at the time of writing. While you certainly shouldn't expect a premium phone out of the A36, it's still a good option for the price point, and definitely worth consideration at this sale price.
Samsung Galaxy A36 5G (128GB): $399.99 $259.99 with activation at Best Buy
Samsung's affordable Galaxy A36 just got hit with up to $140 off for Best Buy's spooky season sale, so long as you let them connect the device to a carrier for you. If you don't, or you don't have Verizon or T-Mobile, you can still save $40 on the 128GB configuration of the phone.
Price comparison: Amazon - $359.99 | Samsung - $359.99
✅Recommended if: you're looking for a chance to get a decent phone for under $300, and you aren't looking for anything too fancy; you want a phone that comes with six years of OS and security updates, without paying a premium price tag; you want a phone that has decent rear- and front-facing cameras.
❌Skip this deal if: you need a device with industry-leading performance speeds; you'd rather save money on an expensive phone month-to-month by going with a carrier payment plan; you need a phone with a headphone jack.
The Samsung Galaxy A36 5G certainly wouldn't be grouped in with the best Android phones on the market, but that's really not what it's meant to be anyway. It offers a budget-friendly alternative to some of the maker's mid-range and premium-level phones, without compromising too much in the way of hardware or performance.
For starters, it's backed by 6GB of RAM and a Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 Octa-Core processor, and this particular deal is for the 128GB storage option, though Samsung also offers a 256GB version. It also has a 5,000mAh battery, fast charging speeds of up to 45W, and a 6.7-inch AMOLED display that gets the job done. As for cameras, it includes a 12MP selfie cam, a 50MP regular rear-facing lens as well as an 8MP ultrawide.
All in all, it seems like a pretty decent pick for the price point, especially if you let Best Buy handle activation for you.

    Do you love the design of Nothing's phones, but dislike the price? The Nothing 3A Lite might be the perfect device for you.
  
Nothing's Phone 3a Lite is coming this week.
British tech company Nothing is best known for its retro-inspired transparent technology design, but it's never been the most affordable option on the market. That looks set to change this week, with the company set to unveil the Nothing 3A Lite on Wednesday.
Nothing says that this will be its first entry-level smartphone, and it will incorporate the transparent design elements seen across the company's range of phones and headphones. We've been given our first glimpse of what looks like the back panel of the phone in a photo from Nothing, but we'll have to wait until Wednesday at 1 p.m. GMT for the full reveal.
The addition of the 3A Lite to Nothing's phone lineup follows on from the launch of the Nothing Phone 3 (the company's ""first, true flagship"") this summer, and the mid-range 3A and 3A Pro back in the spring. For the first time, the company will offer smartphones that range from budget to high-end in price, meaning that there should be something for everyone.
The Nothing Phone 3A Lite is an ""interesting prospect,"" said CNET Editor at Large Andrew Lanxon, who reviewed the all three of the existing phones in the 3 series. ""Nothing's phones are already budget-focused, with the existing Phone 3A coming with a low to midrange price tag,"" he said. ""I'll be keen to see just how much cheaper Nothing can make its phones, while still offering a pleasant everyday user experience.
""Crucially, they should still offer long software support periods to increase the shelf life -- and thereby reduce the overall carbon footprint,"" he added. ""Value should not come at the expense of longevity""
Nothing currently offers six years of Android support with the Nothing Phone 3, which falls short of the seven years Google offers with its latest Pixel phones. The company alsorecently  killed off its flashy Glyph interface -- I personally think the replacement is better -- and has increasingly been emphasizing its original use of AI as a selling point for its phones."

KLA (KLAC)’s stock soared by nearly 80%, driven by substantial revenue growth and increasing margins, as investors place significant bets on its momentum in AI and semiconductor capabilities. The reasons behind this surge show a unique combination of tech demand and market dominance—analyzing this demonstrates why the rally could just be starting.
What’s occurring here? The stock increased by 79%, triggered by a 24% increase in revenue, a 19% rise in net margin, and a 20% increase in valuation multiple. Let’s take a look at how recent actions ignited these profits.
Before diving into the specifics of events that caused the stock surge, here’s what market wisdom suggests: Individual stocks can be risky, but a broader diversified strategy holds substantial value. Strategic asset allocation and diversification allow you to remain invested. Were you aware that investors who panicked and exited the S&P in 2020 missed out on significant gains that followed? Trefis High Quality Portfolio and Empirical Asset Management’s asset allocation approach aim to minimize volatility, enabling you to remain on course.
Our Current Assessment Of KLAC Stock
Opinion: We currently view KLAC stock as appealing yet volatile. Why is that? Explore the complete story. Read Buy or Sell KLAC Stock to learn what informs our current perspective.
Risk: A useful method to assess risk with KLAC is to examine its most significant declines during major market downturns. The stock dropped approximately 73% during the Dot-Com crash and 75% during the Global Financial Crisis. Even during more recent events like the 2018 correction and the Covid pandemic, it fell by over 30%. Last year's inflation shock caused a decline of around 40%. Thus, while KLAC showcases strong fundamentals, it is evident that no stock is immune when markets take a serious turn for the worse.
Consistently selecting winners is a challenging endeavor - especially considering the volatility connected with an individual stock. Instead, Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which comprises 30 stocks, has historically outperformed the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why is this the case? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; offering a smoother experience, as seen in HQ Portfolio performance metrics."

2025 appears to be the year of new products from Samsung. After experimenting with the Galaxy S25 Edge earlier this year, Samsung released its first XR (extended reality) headset earlier this month. Very soon, it may unveil its most hyped device of the year in the form of the triple-folding smartphone. And, as per recent reports, we may not have to wait much longer to witness this new marvel.
As per industry sources, Samsung’s tri-fold is set to make its official appearance as early as this week. The Korea Herald reports the (supposedly named) Galaxy Z TriFold will be unveiled at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) CEO summit, scheduled to take place in the Gyeongju province in South Korea.
While the summit is scheduled to take place between October 28 and 31, the report does not specify the exact date of the reveal or discuss the details of the actual availability of the tri-fold. However, reports from last month, which also indicated a similar launch timeline, suggested the unveiling at the summit would be followed by an official launch early in November, with the device hitting the shelves in the following weeks. Without a confirmation from Samsung, we’re not confident about those details.
Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority?
Meanwhile, leaker Evan Blass recently claimed that the tri-fold may be limited to specific markets, including Korea, China, Singapore, Taiwan, and potentially the UAE. It implies that, contrary to earlier reports of a US launch, Samsung could skip releasing the foldable in Western markets. However, we’d love to be wrong about it.
It was also previously reported that Samsung is preparing to pilot the new design with a mere 50,000 units. That may be imperative as the handset is set to be priced way above any other model it sells. As per recent estimates, it could be priced around 4 million won (~$2,780).
Besides the phone’s peculiar design, little is known about its specifications, though rumors hint at what to expect. Foremost, the Samsung tri-fold foldable is expected to use last year’s Snapdragon 8 Elite rather than the newer and better Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. The foldable is also likely to feature a 200MP camera — just like the Galaxy Z Fold 7.
We expect the foldable to run a special version of One UI 8 optimized to run up to three apps concurrently in portrait mode. The phone (it feels unfair to call it one, though!) is also confirmed to fold inwards — in a square C shape, which is distinct from the Huawei Mate XT’s zig-zag fold.

Here’s why we believe JM Smucker (SJM) deserves your attention.
Free Cash Flow Yield is defined as free cash flow per share divided by the stock price. Why is it significant? When a company generates a substantial amount of cash per share, it can be utilized to drive additional revenue growth, or simply paid out in dividends or used for buybacks to benefit shareholders. For some context, JM Smucker offers a variety of branded food and beverage items, including coffee, peanut butter, specialty spreads, pet food, and cooking ingredients through well-recognized consumer brands.
Investing in a single stock can carry risks, but a more diversified strategy such as the one we utilize with the Trefis High Quality Portfolio offers substantial advantages. Trefis collaborates with Empirical Asset Management – a wealth manager based in the Boston area – whose asset allocation methods achieved positive returns during the 2008-09 period, at a time when the S&P declined by more than 40%. Empirical has integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio within this asset allocation strategy to offer clients better returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; providing a more stable ride, as highlighted in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
But do these figures convey the complete picture? Read Buy or Sell SJM Stock to determine if JM Smucker still possesses an advantage that stands up to scrutiny.
This is just one perspective on stocks. Trefis High Quality Portfolio takes a broader view and is tailored to mitigate stock-specific risks while allowing for upside potential.
The statistics below derive from a high FCF yield selection strategy between 12/31/2016 and 6/30/2025. The figures are calculated based on monthly selections, under the assumption that a stock once chosen cannot be selected again for the subsequent 180 days.
That being said, SJM is not immune to market downturns. It experienced a decline of about 40% during the Dot-Com Bubble and nearly 38% amid the Global Financial Crisis. The 2018 Correction and Inflation Shock resulted in a drop of around 31-32%. Even the selloff due to Covid caused a nearly 20% decrease. Strong fundamentals do not completely eliminate risks. When markets decline, even stable stocks can sustain significant losses.
Consistently identifying winners is not an easy endeavor – especially considering the volatility tied to individual stocks. Instead, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has demonstrated a solid history of outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four years. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with diminished risks compared to the benchmark index; a smoother investment experience, as reflected in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics."

Shopify (SHOP) shares have surged 21% in the last month and are currently priced at $172.95. Our algorithm-based multi-factor evaluation indicates that it may be advisable to lower exposure to SHOP shares at this time. Our main concern lies in the current valuation, as a price point of $121 may not be unattainable. We believe there is minimal risk in SHOP stock given its overall Strong operational performance and financial standing. However, due to its Very High valuation, the stock seems Relatively Expensive.
Here is our analysis:
SHOP stock has increased significantly lately, making it appear relatively expensive at this time. Although this might seem like a chance, there are substantial risks associated with investing in a single stock. Conversely, a broader diversified strategy, as practiced with Trefis High Quality Portfolio, offers considerable value. Additionally, contemplate how the long-term performance of your portfolio could be enhanced by including 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto alongside equities.
Let’s delve into the details of each of the factors evaluated, but first, for a quick overview: With a market capitalization of $224 Bil, Shopify delivers a global commerce platform that enables merchants to showcase, manage, promote, and sell products across various sales channels.
This table illustrates how SHOP is growing in comparison to the broader market. For further details see: SHOP Revenue Comparison

SHOP has performed worse than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. This assessment takes into account both (a) the magnitude of the stock's decline and, (b) the speed of its recovery.

However, the risks are not confined to significant market crashes. Stocks can decline even during favorable market conditions—consider events such as earnings announcements, business updates, and outlook changes. Review SHOP Dip Buyer Analyses to understand how the stock has bounced back from sharp declines in the past.
The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a history of consistently outperforming benchmarks that include all three—S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. Why is this the case?

Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) stock merits your attention. Why? Because it offers  high margins at a discounted price. Here are some details.
Although revenue growth is beneficial, this should not be viewed purely from a growth perspective. Pricing power and high margins yield consistent, predictable profits and cash flows, which lower risk and enable capital reinvestment. The market typically rewards this.
The stock has been underperforming of late due to ongoing generic competition affecting sales of its older drugs as well as mixed earnings guidance. The company’s legacy product revenue continues to decline amid pricing pressures and policy headwinds. That said, positive trends include promising clinical data and FDA priority review for newer treatments, as well as strong growth momentum in its cardiovascular and hematology drug pipelines.
For a brief background, Bristol-Myers Squibb offers biopharmaceutical products globally, focusing on hematology, oncology, cardiovascular, immunology, fibrotic, neuroscience, and COVID-19 treatments, including Revlimid for multiple myeloma.
Do these figures reveal the complete picture? Check Buy or Sell BMY Stock to determine if Bristol-Myers Squibb continues to maintain its competitive edge.
Investing in a single stock involves risks, but a broader diversified approach, like the one we implement with Trefis High Quality Portfolio, offers significant value. Our strategy extends beyond just equities. A portfolio comprising 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto, in addition to equities and bonds, is expected to yield higher returns in the next 1-3 years while providing better protection in the event of a 20% market downturn. We’ve analyzed the data.
Stocks Like These Can Outperform. Here Is Data
Here’s how we select these stocks: We focus on stocks valued at over $10 billion in market capitalization and filter out those with high CFO (cash flow from operations) margins or operating margins. Additionally, we consider only those stocks that have experienced a significant decline in valuation over the past year.
Listed below are statistics for stocks that follow this selection strategy since 12/31/2016.
But Consider The Risk
That said, BMY is not immune to significant downturns. It dropped approximately 44% during the Dot-Com bubble and 43% during the Global Financial Crisis. The 2018 correction and Inflation Shock also had a severe impact, causing declines of over 35%. Even the Covid pandemic reduced the stock's value by roughly 31%. Strong fundamentals are important, but when the market shifts, BMY can still sustain considerable losses.
The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which consists of 30 stocks, has a proven record of consistently outperforming its benchmark that includes all three indices – the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000.

43,2025-10-27,"If you've ever seen a mechanic draw a tiny line on a spark plug before changing it, they're not performing witchcraft — they're indexing it. The idea is simple. Most standard types of spark plugs have a ground strap — that little metal arm that arcs over the center electrode. When the spark plug fires, that strap can either help or hinder the flame kernel. Point it toward the intake valve, and you're giving the spark a clear path to ignite the air-fuel mixture. Face it the wrong way, and you're blocking the flame kernel. Spark plug indexing won't do much in a stock car, but in high-rpm, high-compression builds, it's a whole different story – this minor tweak can mean a smoother burn, cleaner emissions, and a few extra horsepower. 
Combustion is all about timing and flow. When the spark ignites the air-fuel mixture, the flame expands outward. If the electrode blocks that path, you get a tiny disturbance. This is not a major issue for daily driving, but in a tuned or high-compression engine, it translates to lost potential. After all, when you're chasing smoother combustion and better efficiency, even a degree or two of spark angle matters.
Before threading in a spark plug, the mechanic will mark where the ground strap sits, and install it in the position of the intake valve. If it's not pointing toward the intake valve, they'll use a different indexing washer to alter how deep the plug sits. Finally, they tighten and torque the plug to the correct spec, and double check if the ground strap is aligned to the intake valve position. It's kind of painstaking. It's almost ridiculous. And yet, in the world of combustion perfection, it matters.
The goal is to create consistent flame propagation. In a tightly packed, high-compression engine, any inconsistencies in the position of an indexed performance spark plug can influence detonation, knock resistance, and ignition timing. Some dyno tests -– like those shared by Vivid Racing -– show marginal power increases of around 1-2 hp, which is negligible for daily cars. But in racing, that little added horsepower is something.
This is also why indexing is more common in performance or boosted builds than in stock engines. Turbocharged setups, for instance, are particularly sensitive to combustion efficiency. Engineers know this too, which is why newer spark plugs, like NGK, are already ""indexed."" Still, for many garage tinkerers, marking and rotating plugs remains a badge of pride –- a nod to an era when performance was earned with a wrench and patience."

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

 




Soon to come
The Samsung Galaxy S26 will overhaul the base-model Galaxy for 2026, adding a fresh design and long-overdue improvements. There will be a larger display, a new chip, and a revamped rear camera system. 
 




The starter Android
Google was the first to add Qi2 magnets, making the base Pixel 10 a surprisingly-great alternative to iPhones. It also gained a telephoto camera lens and other improvements, stepping up to Samsung's level. However, Samsung will have a chance to respond with the Galaxy S26 series. 
Samsung is expected to launch a new lineup of Galaxy phones early next year, and rumor season is officially underway. At this stage, we're not even sure what Samsung's base-model Galaxy for 2026 will be called — it could be the Samsung Galaxy S26 or the Galaxy S26 Pro. Either way, we do know there will be a 6.3-inch handset arriving just in time to compete with the Google Pixel 10.
Google recently launched the Pixel 10 series, challenging competitors like Samsung in major ways. Specifically, an upgraded camera system and Qi2 magnets put the ball in Samsung's court to respond with the Galaxy S26. If you're in the market for a base-model Android flagship, you'll likely be choosing between these two phones in a few months.
Let's preview how the Galaxy S26 will stack up against the Pixel 10 in a speculative comparison, based on the rumors and leaks available.
 



Samsung is expected to debut the Galaxy S26 series sometime early next year. For reference, the Galaxy S25 lineup was revealed on Jan. 22 and became available for purchase the following month, on Feb. 7, 2025. However, recent rumors suggest Samsung may push back the launch date to either February or March.
We expect to see at least three models, including the base variant, which could be called the Galaxy S26 or Galaxy S26 Pro.
It's unclear whether Samsung will raise the base model's price next year. The current Galaxy S25 starts at $799 and ships with 128GB of storage. If Samsung cuts the lowest tier and ships the Galaxy S26 with 256GB of storage as standard, a price hike could come with that change. The company could also tweak configuration options to make 512GB or 1TB versions available.
Meanwhile, the Google Pixel 10 was revealed on Aug. 20, 2025, and became officially available on Aug. 28. The smartphone is priced at $799 for the base model with 128GB of storage, and a 256GB configuration costs $100 more. You can pick from Indigo, Lemongrass, Frost, and Obsidian colorways.

Samsung is rumored to be caving to consumer trends that show buyers prefer larger phones. The Galaxy S26 will reportedly sport a 6.3-inch screen, matching competitors like the Google Pixel 10.
As a result, the Galaxy S26 may be bigger than its predecessor, measuring 149.3 x 71.4 x 6.96mm according to leaked CAD renderings. This shift could also add weight to the device, but at 162 grams, the Galaxy S25 was already undercutting Pixels in terms of heft.
The Galaxy S26 will reportedly look familiar compared to recent Samsung phones, but will take special inspiration from the newest models, like the Galaxy S25 Edge and Galaxy Z Fold 7. It may have a raised, oval-shaped camera platform that will house the three rear camera lenses. This will slightly change the phone's appearance without deviating from Samsung's typical Armor Aluminum chassis and frosted glass back.
 



If the rumored Galaxy S26 measurements hold, the Pixel 10 would be larger in every dimension. The current Pixel 10 measures 152.8mm x 72mm x 8.6mm, making it one of the largest and thickest 6.3-inch phones on the market. It's also one of the heaviest, weighing 204 grams and almost certainly outweighing the Galaxy S26.
The Pixel 10's display is a 6.3-inch Actua OLED panel with a 1080 x 2424 resolution. It supports a variable refresh rate from 60Hz to 120Hz and has a maximum brightness of 3,000 nits.
By comparison, the Galaxy S26 may bring a 6.3-inch Dynamic LTPO AMOLED 2X panel with 120Hz refresh rates and HDR10+ support. The Galaxy S25 only offered 2,600 nits of brightness, but it's possible Samsung elevates this on the Galaxy S26 to better compete with the Pixel 10.
 



The Pixel 10 has a glossy back and a pill-shaped camera bar at the top, which protrudes noticeably from the rear. Both phones have an IP68 durability rating against dust and water ingress.
 



Hardware and performance may be the biggest differentiators between the Samsung Galaxy S26 and the Google Pixel 10.
While we don't know exactly how the rumored Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 ""for Galaxy"" might perform in the Galaxy S26, we do know that the current Snapdragon 8 Elite already beats the Tensor G5 in the Pixel 10. The Tensor G5 may be better optimized, but Snapdragon chips have proved to be the winner in raw performance, gaming, and AI processing of late.
That doesn't invalidate the Pixel 10's performance improvements. The Google Tensor G5 chip is the best Google system-on-a-chip yet, with a CPU that's 34% faster on average and a TPU that's up to 60% more powerful. It's worth noting that the Pixel 10 feels snappy in daily use for most tasks, but gaming is still a major pain point.

There are also some notable omissions on the Pixel 10, like no support for UFS 4.0 storage on the base configuration, and a downgrade to Wi-Fi 6E. The Galaxy S26 may support Wi-Fi 7 and may even upgrade Bluetooth connectivity to match the Pixel 10, which is stellar for longevity. As both phones will likely get seven years of full OS upgrades, these specs might matter down the line.
 



This generation, Google added a telephoto camera to the Pixel 10, bringing 5x optical zoom to the base model by way of a 10.8MP lens. That brings the total number of rear cameras on the Pixel 10 to three. Although the other sensors are tweaked, the system is still great, with a 48MP main lens and a 12MP ultrawide camera.
Samsung is rumored to upgrade the cameras on the Galaxy S26 for the first time since the Galaxy S22. It's unclear how big an improvement these changes would bring, but we're expecting to see a new primary shooter and an upgraded 50MP ultrawide camera. Crucially, the telephoto lens is tipped to remain the same, which would give the Pixel 10 the edge.
 



We're entering a great time to be in the market for the best Android phones. Following a few years of iterative upgrades, Samsung and Google are starting to challenge each other to make better smartphones. Google just shipped the Pixel 10 with a telephoto lens for the first time, matching the Galaxy S25. Soon, the Galaxy S26 is expected to add magnetic Qi2 support for the first time, matching the Pixel 10.
Regardless of whether you pick the Pixel 10 now or choose to wait for the Galaxy S26, you're going to get an excellent handset. However, rumors and leaks point to the Galaxy S26 being the one to beat. It'll have a larger display, upgraded camera sensors, Qi2 magnets, and a Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip that could run laps around the Pixel 10.
It's worth noting that the Samsung Galaxy S26 is still some months away. With a January or February (or March) 2026 release window, you'll have to be patient if you want to wait for the next crop of Samsung flagships.
 




The one to beat
Samsung is expected to respond to the Pixel 10's success by adding full Qi2 magnetic support, better cameras, and even more performance. If the price is competitive, it'll be hard to beat the Galaxy S26's rumored improvements.
 




For Google fans
The Google Pixel 10 is the starter Android phone, with plenty of exclusive features and a great MagSafe, Qi2, and Pixelsnap accessory ecosystyem. It does lack power and polish in some areas, which might make some buyers want to wait for Samsung's launch.

CrowdStrike stock (NASDAQ: CRWD) has experienced an impressive performance, increasing by 10% in just the last week and hitting a peak of $522 on October 23, 2025. This surge has brought its year-to-date gains to an impressive 50%.
The recent upward trend is primarily due to a series of analyst upgrades and increased price targets. This favorable sentiment follows the company's robust performance and strategic developments showcased at its recent Fal.Con event in September.
With the stock currently valued around $520, investors are enjoying significant gains. The key question now is: After this remarkable rise, is CRWD stock still a worthwhile buy?
While there are minimal fundamental concerns regarding CRWD stock, we view it as a costly choice at its current trade price of approximately $520. The major concern is that its current valuation seems very high.
We arrived at this conclusion by comparing CRWD's present valuation with its operating performance over the past few years and its current and historical financial conditions. Our examination of CrowdStrike across essential metrics—Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience—indicates that the company maintains a strong operating performance and financial situation, as elaborated below.
That said, if you are looking for upside with reduced volatility than holding an individual stock like CRWD, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has significantly outperformed its benchmark—a mixture of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has delivered returns exceeding 105% since inception. Why is this the case? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded better returns with less risk than the benchmark index; providing less of a roller-coaster experience, as reflected in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
Let’s confront the obvious issue first – valuation. When evaluating the price per dollar of sales or cash flow, CrowdStrike appears extraordinarily expensive.
These ratios imply that investors are paying a substantial premium for anticipated growth. The question arises whether that growth can warrant such elevated valuations.
Here’s where the narrative takes an intriguing turn. CrowdStrike's revenue growth has been nothing less than impressive, making a strong argument for why investors might accept those elevated multiples.
This persistent high-growth trajectory in the crucial cybersecurity sector indicates that CrowdStrike has discovered a successful model. The company continues to outpace the wider market significantly.
This is where CrowdStrike's story becomes more intricate. In spite of remarkable revenue growth, conventional profitability metrics reveal a troubling situation.
This contrast suggests that CrowdStrike is investing heavily in growth while generating solid cash flows. The company seems to be focusing on expanding market share over immediate profitability.
Despite challenges to profitability, CrowdStrike's balance sheet is robust and offers essential flexibility for its growth strategy.
What contributes to the strength of the balance sheet? The financial stability metrics are outstanding:
This financial robustness enables CrowdStrike to persist with aggressive investments without being concerned about funding limitations.
Assessing CrowdStrike's performance during downturns aids in understanding its resilience as a long-term investment.
CrowdStrike tends to undergo more dramatic fluctuations but demonstrates substantial recovery capacity, likely due to the vital role of cybersecurity services. Check out our dashboard on – How Low Can CRWD Stock Really Go – for more information.
Additionally, investing in a single stock without thorough analysis can be perilous. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has surpassed its all-cap stock benchmark (the combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to deliver strong returns for investors. Why is this? The quarterly rebalanced mixture of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks has provided a proactive method to capitalize on favorable market conditions while mitigating losses during downturns, as outlined in RV Portfolio performance metrics.
CrowdStrike poses a classic conflict between growth and value. The company merges outstanding growth with robust financial stability, categorizing it as a high-quality business. However, its current valuation around $520 seems excessive, even for a firm with such remarkable fundamentals. Naturally, we could be mistaken in our evaluation, and investors might continue to be willing to pay 30 times or more for CRWD stock revenues. Nonetheless, investors should also consider the associated risks. We believe that waiting for a more favorable entry point may be the better option, as the existing price seems to reflect a lot of anticipated future success."

When I packed up my apartment in Dublin to move back to Delhi, I thought the hardest part would be saying goodbye to friends, the café that had become my go-to for breakfast, and my favorite museums.
Instead, the hardest part was arriving back home.
A year in Dublin wasn't a lifetime, but it was long enough to change me. Although my experience wasn't perfect, I got to study at my dream university and travel to places in Ireland I had only ever seen in movies.
Still, the housing crisis, high rent, and uncertain job market made staying feel impossible. So, in 2024, I headed back to the Indian city where I'd spent most of my childhood.
I expected Delhi to feel loud, comforting, familiar — basically, the way it always had. Instead, I felt disconnected from my surroundings. Part of this was because I couldn't stop comparing it to Dublin.
Delhi has always been a part of me, even when I wasn't living there. I spent most of my teenage years and early 20s in Mumbai and Bangalore, but I still visited Delhi often.
Finally, at 24, I moved back to Delhi for four years. It felt like home, but I rarely felt the same sense of excitement and awe that comes with living in a new place. By the time I left for Dublin at 28, I was excited to try somewhere new.
In Dublin, I walked everywhere, got lost on purpose, and discovered things I never would've noticed if I were rushing through. Every day felt like a mini adventure.
Living like that made me realize how much I craved novelty — and I wondered if maybe, my home city could surprise me if I learned to look at it differently.
So, I decided to try an experiment. I'd get to know Delhi the way I had once gotten to know Dublin: like a tourist.
First up, I decided to revisit India Gate. As a kid, it had been the backdrop for school picnics, family outings, and those unhurried summer days.
I thought I might sit on the lawns and have a picnic, a habit I'd picked up again in Dublin. So much had changed since my childhood — the lawns were empty, picnics were no longer allowed, and a food court had taken their place.
Beneath those changes, though, India Gate carried the same warmth I remembered.
Still, I wandered through the monument, and when a photographer offered to take my picture, I couldn't resist. It felt oddly fun to do something so touristy in my own city.
After India Gate, I headed to Lodhi Garden, a park I've always loved and one that also holds memories of some of my earliest dates with my boyfriend.
This time, a friend suggested I visit the garden during golden hour. I walked slowly, watching the light shift across the centuries-old tombs and stone arches, and the garden felt more beautiful than I'd ever remembered.
In Dublin, I made a point to explore every new-to-me corner of the city. If I happened to walk by a cute café, a bookstore, or a little shop, I went inside and let small discoveries unfold around me.
Because I was new to the city, I didn't worry about schedules or routines — I just followed my curiosity, and loved how even tiny finds could feel exciting.
Meanwhile, in Delhi, there were many places I'd passed countless times and never visited. One of these was Faqir Chand and Sons, the city's oldest bookstore, tucked inside the bustling Khan Market.
This time, I decided to go in. The walls were stacked with books in that charmingly chaotic way only old bookstores seem to manage, and walking in felt like discovering another layer of Delhi.
My dream had been to stay longer in Dublin, so leaving wasn't easy — but the harder part was learning to feel at home again in Delhi. 
Slowly reconnecting with the city made the transition easier.
Delhi will always be my home, but having moved around so much, I know I'm not done exploring. I still dream of living in smaller cities, ones that mix my favorite parts of Dublin with the lively, slightly chaotic energy I've always known at home.
I learned that Delhi hadn't changed much in the year I was away, but I had. Exploring the city with a new lens helped me find a version of it that was both fresh and home.
It taught me that every place holds surprises if you're open to noticing them, and I'm excited to carry that curiosity into the next city I call home.

Here is why we believe Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) stock deserves attention: It is expanding, generating cash, and is available at a considerable valuation discount. Let’s examine the figures.
Free Cash Flow Yield is calculated as free cash flow per share divided by stock price. Why is this important? If a company generates a substantial amount of cash per share, it can be utilized to support further revenue expansion, or simply distributed as dividends or repurchased to benefit shareholders. For some context, Abercrombie & Fitch functions as a specialty retailer providing apparel through its Hollister and A&Fitch brands, with around 729 stores located throughout Europe, Asia, Canada, the Middle East, the US, and other international sites.
Individual stocks can be volatile, but there is significant value in a more comprehensive, diversified strategy. Strategic asset allocation and diversification enable you to remain invested. Were you aware that investors who panicked out of the S&P in 2020 missed out on substantial gains that came afterwards? Trefis High Quality Portfolio and Empirical Asset Management’s investment strategy are crafted to minimize volatility so you can maintain your investment course.
But do these figures reveal the entire story? Read Buy or Sell ANF Stock to determine if Abercrombie & Fitch still possesses an advantage that remains solid.
The following statistics stem from a “high FCF yield with growth and discount” selection strategy since 12/31/2016. The statistics are computed based on selections made on a monthly basis, and assume that once a stock is selected, it cannot be re-selected for the following 180 days.
That being said, ANF isn’t immune to significant declines. It plummeted 83% during both the Dot-Com Bubble and the Global Financial Crisis. The inflation shock also severely impacted it, causing a near 70% drop. Even smaller shocks, such as those in 2018 and during Covid, resulted in declines of over 50%. Strong fundamentals are important, but when the market shifts, ANF demonstrates it can still experience serious setbacks.
However, the risk is not confined to large market downturns. Stocks can decline even when the overall market is performing well – consider events such as earnings reports, business updates, or changes in outlook. Read ANF Dip Buyer Analyses to learn how the stock has bounced back from sharp declines in the past.
Consistently picking winning stocks is a challenging endeavor – especially given the volatility tied to individual stocks. Instead, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which comprises 30 stocks, has historically outperformed the S&P 500 over the past 4 years. Why is this the case? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded better returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; thus avoiding extreme fluctuations, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics."

Beating the market is hard. But if you’d followed the missives of President Trump and his team this year, you might have found a cheat code.
On Monday, GameStop ($3.8 billion in revenue) shares opened trading more than 2% from their prior close, more than double the S&P 500’s early gain. The move came after the White House on Sunday shared a GameStop social media post celebrating the “Halo” series coming to PlayStation for the first time. The official account added a photo of Trump as the game’s hero and wrote, “Power to the Players.” It wasn’t a stock tip, but traders seemed to take it as one.
The same morning, Argentina’s markets took off following the results of the country’s midterm elections in which President Javier Milei, a candidate heavily endorsed by Trump, and his Libertarian party expanded its control of Congress. The Global X MSCI Argentina ETF, with about $620 million in assets, jumped 18% in early trading. Throughout October the U.S. Treasury had spent more than $1 billion buying pesos to sure up the South American country’s notoriously volatile currency.
Neither the GameStop nor the Argentina actions came with explicit endorsements to buy assets, but the effect was the same. Anyone who took the heavy-hint made money in short order. Those moves added to a growing list of rallies that have followed what can be construed as market tips from the Trump administration. Some like touting Tesla’s stock and the President saying it was a good time to buy were direct, raising ethical questions. Others, like GameStop and Argentina, required reading between the lines.
It’s not unusual for a president to move markets. They’re the most powerful person in the world, and policy (or even hints of policy changes) alone can shift trillions. What’s less common is doing it through what looks feels like a WallStreetBets post. When the George W. Bush administration took over mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in September 2008 to calm the housing crisis, the S&P 500 jumped nearly 3% at the open of the next trading day.
That’s how it usually works. Markets react to policy, not to what stocks a president or cabinet member seems to favor.
In March, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick went on Fox News and told viewers to “buy Tesla.” The company’s shares had been cut in half since December after a wave of vandalism and political backlash following Elon Musk’s role in the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency initiative. The shares have rallied since, climbing about 80% since Lutnick’s interview.
A few weeks later, Trump himself helped move the market. In early April, the President announced sweeping new global tariffs that sent stocks tumbling. A little more than a week later, he posted on Truth Social that it was a “great time to buy.” Hours after that, he temporarily paused many of the tariffs. The S&P 500 jumped 9.5% that day, its third biggest single-day gain this century. The sequence drew questions about whether officials had traded ahead of the announcement, though no evidence has surfaced that anyone did.
On October 22, Energy Secretary Chris Wright called oil a bargain. He told Fox News that prices were low and that the U.S. would gradually start rebuilding the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The very next day, the Trump administration rolled out new sanctions against Russian oil companies. Oil prices soared by 5% on the news.
All of this has raised familiar questions about where enthusiasm ends and influence begins. Some ethics experts say none of this meets the definition of insider trading. As Bloomberg’s Matt Levine told NPR, the key test is whether someone trades on “material nonpublic information” that’s obtained improperly. Public comments don’t qualify. Still, Levine and others noted that while it may not be illegal, it’s hardly routine for government officials to promote private investments.
Whether it’s luck or something more nefarious, the record speaks for itself. The Trump trade has been a winner.

Intuit is Autodesk’s peer within the Application Software sector and offers:
1) A lower valuation (P/OpInc) relative to Autodesk stock2) However, it surpasses Autodesk in revenue and operating income growth.
This disparity between valuation and performance may indicate that purchasing INTU stock is more advantageous than buying ADSK stock.
There are other factors to consider as well. Intuit holds a strong position in the financial software market, which is seeing major gains from the growing adoption of AI. Its business is predictable and less affected by economic cycles, since tax and accounting demand remains steady. In contrast, Autodesk operates in the design and engineering software sector, which is more sensitive to economic fluctuations and competitive innovation pressures.

For context, Autodesk (ADSK) offers 3D design, engineering, and entertainment software, including solutions for civil engineering applications such as land development, transportation, and environmental projects, which are distributed directly and through resellers worldwide.
This is merely one method for assessing investments. Trefis High Quality Portfolio analyzes a broader range of factors and aims to mitigate stock-specific risks while allowing for potential upside.
Is The Discrepancy In Stock Price Short-Lived?
A potential approach to evaluate whether Autodesk stock is currently overpriced compared to other tickers would involve examining how these metrics compared among companies exactly a year ago. In particular, if there has been a significant reversal in Autodesk's trend over the past 12 months, it could indicate that this current discrepancy may soon be resolved. Conversely, an ongoing underperformance in revenue and operating income growth for Autodesk would support the conclusion that the stock is indeed overpriced relative to its competitors, and this situation may persist.

Here is why we believe Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) stock is worthy of consideration as a value investment. It is presently trading nearly 38% lower than its one-year peak, and is also being traded at a price to sales multiple that is beneath the average for the past three years. Nonetheless, it possesses reasonable fundamentals for its current level of valuation.
There are other trends worth noting too. Regeneron’s core approved medicines, such as Dupixent - an anti-inflammatory therapy used for eczema, asthma, and other allergic conditions - and Eylea, a leading eye treatment for macular degeneration and diabetic eye disease, hold strong market positions. The company’s pipeline spans multiple therapeutic areas including oncology, rare diseases, immunology, and allergies, with several drugs in late-stage trials offering meaningful future growth potential.
To provide some context, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals develops innovative medicines on a global scale, which includes therapies for eye diseases, atopic dermatitis, asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis through processes of discovery, development, manufacturing, and commercialization.
Investing in a single stock can be risky; however, there is significant value in a broader, diversified approach that we adopt with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Let us pose this question: Over the past 5 years, which index do you think the Trefis High Quality Portfolio has outperformed – the S&P 500, S&P 1500 Equal Weighted, or both? The answer could surprise you. Discover how our advisory framework helps stack the odds in your favor.
 
 
Yet, do these figures represent the complete picture? Check Buy or Sell REGN Stock to determine if Regeneron Pharmaceuticals still possesses an advantage that holds true under scrutiny.
Stocks Like These Can Outperform. Here Is Data
Presented below are statistics for stocks with a similar selection strategy applied between 12/31/2016 and 6/30/2025.
But Consider The Risk
That being said, REGN is not immune to significant declines. It dropped nearly 69% during the Dot-Com crash, around 58% in the Global Financial Crisis, and 48% during the 2018 correction. Even the more recent shocks—the Covid pandemic and inflation surge—experienced declines of around 25-27%. While the stock maintains solid fundamentals, significant losses can still occur when the market experiences turbulence.
However, the risk is not restricted to severe market downturns. Stocks can decline even in stable market conditions – consider events such as earnings announcements, business updates, or changes in outlook. Read REGN Dip Buyer Analyses to see how the stock has bounced back from sharp declines in the past.

Microsoft’s pivot to multiplatform gaming has hit a new and irreversible milestone with the news that the next Halo game, and each one that follows in the future, will be coming to PlayStation. To defend this seismic shift in a decades-old strategy, the executives in charge of Xbox have been throwing shade at the notion of exclusivity and reframing the console war in broader terms.
On the eve of announcing Halo: Campaign Evolved for PS5, head of Microsoft content and studios Matt Booty reportedly told The New York Times that today’s gamers don’t really care which devices they play games on. âOur biggest competition isnât another console,â he said. âWe are competing more and more with everything from TikTok to movies.â
âWe are all seeking to meet people where they are,â Booty added.
It’s a sentiment Microsoft has been pushing ever since it’s “everything is an Xbox” marketing pitch began rolling out late last year. Having failed at being the number one console to game on, Xbox is pivoting to trying to reach players wherever they already are, whether that’s on PS5 and Switch 2 or TVs and smartphones.
“I want Xbox to act like every other form of entertainment, where you can access it wherever you want, wherever you are,” Xbox President Sarah Bond told Mashable last week.
She continued,
You look at Call of Duty, you look atÂ Minecraft, you look atÂ Fortnite, you look atÂ Roblox. That’s actually what’s really driving community in gaming. That’s where people gather and they have experiences. And the idea of locking it to one store or one device is antiquated for most people. You want to be able to play with your friends anywhere, regardless of what they’re on. And we’re really leaning into that with this experience.
This isn’t the first time someone at Microsoft has poured cold water on the idea of keeping games like Halo exclusive. CEO Satya Nadella was critical of the role they play in defining the gaming landscape back during his 2023 FTC trial testimony over the acquisition of Activision Blizzard.
“If it was up to me I would love to get rid of the entire exclusives on consoles, but thatâs not for me to define especially as a low share player in the console market,” he said at the time. “The dominant player there [Sony] has defined market competition using exclusives, so thatâs the world we live in. I have no love for that world.”
Why has Xbox changed if Sony hasn’t? While Microsoft execs champion the company’s new “play anywhere” philosophy, Bloomberg reports that mandates for much steeper profit margins at Xbox are the main driver of this multiplatform sea change. After all, how does putting an Unreal Engine 5 remake of a 25-year-old game on PS5 help Microsoft convince people to stop scrolling on their phones and pick up a controller instead?
If Booty’s line about TikTok sounds familiar, it’s because it’s borrowed from something ex-Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime said seven years ago. “My competitive set is much bigger than my direct competitors in Sony and Microsoft,” he said back before he retired. “I compete for time. When I do that, I have to be creative and innovative in order to win that battle.â
Nintendo weathered the threat from Netflix by doing the opposite of Microsoft: doubling-down on exclusive games and convenient dedicated gaming hardware. The tech giant now appears to be taking the inverse approach: multiplatform games and more expensive devices.
The ROG Xbox Ally X is a $1,000 handheld that Microsoft keeps hinting is a blueprint for its future hardware. Bond also recently said the next-gen Xbox will be “very premium” and very high-end, even though its games will seemingly all be available everywhere else. We’ll see how each of those approaches pans out over the next console generation.

Apple’s new-product drops are huge events, and understandably so. The debut of a new Apple device like the M5 laptop sends thousands and perhaps millions of people to stores to be the first to have it. But the more economical reaction is to start watching the price of the device it’s replacing: in this case, the M4 line of laptops. Sure enough, those prices are coming down â Amazon is now selling the 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro for just $1,600.
It’s not like the M4 MacBook Pro is some kind of dated or outmoded device â it debuted exactly one year ago, with all the bells, whistles, and accompanying hype we’re now seeing for the M5 models. And that hype has been totally justified â the average Amazon review of the M4 MacBook Pro is a stellar 4.8 out of 5 stars.
See at Amazon
Apple products in general and MacBooks in particular have made their bones for years thanks in no small part to their exceptional design. Frankly, they’re just really good-looking machines. That of course would wear off quickly if they didn’t have anything going for them under the hood, but that’s never been the case with the MacBooks.
The display is where the true beauty lies with the M4 MacBook Pro, because it’s a 14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR screen with up to 1600 nits of peak brightness that is simply stunning. Creative work like photo and video editing will never look better, nor will your streaming or video calls. There’s also never any worry about lag or glitching out, because the M4 chip and its integrated graphics driver are designed to deliver peak visuals.
Everything else in and about the M4 MacBook Pro is either Apple’s very latest tech and features, or close enough to it to still be about the best laptops on the market. First and foremost is Apple Intelligence, the advanced artificial intelligence assistant that is the perfect combination of power, speed, and security â not even Apple can see your searches or search history. When you start exploring Apple Intelligence, you won’t want to stop, and with the M4 MacBook Pro’s battery life extending almost 24 hours on a single charge, you won’t have to.
There’s no shame in your game if you’re a one-generation-ago shopper, especially when that previous-gen tech is only a year old and possessing nearly all of the features of its successor model. That’s the deal that presents itself with the M4 MacBook Pro, because it’s worth every penny of its newly reduced $1,600 Amazon price.Â

Deckers Outdoor (DECK) stock should be on your radar. Here’s why – it is currently trading in the support range ($82.59 – $91.29), levels from which it has rebounded significantly in the past. Over the past decade, Deckers Outdoor stock attracted buying interest at this level three times and subsequently achieved an average peak return of 59.2%.
But is the price movement sufficient on its own? It certainly helps if the fundamentals are solid. For DECK, read Buy or Sell DECK Stock to evaluate how compelling this buying opportunity may be.
Investing in a single stock can be risky, yet there is significant value in a more diversified approach that we employ with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Additionally, consider what your portfolio's long-term performance might look like if you included 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto alongside equities.
Here are some quick data points for Deckers Outdoor that should aid decision-making:
While the stock has declined this year due to mixed earnings and margin pressures from rising tariffs and higher selling expenses, there are several positives, including strong brand momentum from the high-growth Hoka and Ugg footwear lines, expanding international opportunities, and a solid financial foundation. Over the last quarter, Ugg sales rose 10.1% and Hoka sales grew 11.1% to $634.1 million.
For a quick background, Deckers Outdoor offers footwear, apparel, and accessories for casual and high-performance use, distributing through department stores, specialty retailers, and operating 140 retail locations worldwide as of March 2021.
What Is Stock-Specific Risk If The Market Crashes?
However, DECK is not exempt from significant declines. It decreased by 44% during the Dot-Com crash and suffered a staggering 77% drop during the Global Financial Crisis. Even the 2018 correction resulted in a decline of over 26%. The Covid sell-off cut approximately 55%, and the inflation shock reduced it by nearly 49%. Strong fundamentals are important, but when turmoil strikes, DECK is no exception.
Yet the risk is not confined to major market crashes. Stocks can decline even when markets are performing well – consider occurrences like earnings reports, business updates, or outlook adjustments. Read DECK Dip Buyer Analyses to learn how the stock has bounced back from sharp declines in the past.
The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a history of successfully outperforming its benchmark, which encompasses all three – the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices.

BigBear.ai's stock has soared 76% in 2025, largely due to meme stock traits and retail investor interest in its ""AI"" branding, despite a sharp 18% Q2 revenue decline and a 16-fold increase in net losses.The company faces significant financial challenges, including a high 13x price-to-sales ratio, intense competition, and analyst views of being 20-24% overvalued, making its upcoming Q3 results on November 10th critical for its future.
Shares of BigBear.ai have soared 76% in 2025, according to the Wall Street Journal.
This raises a simple question: With revenue plunging and losses soaring, why are shares of this provider of decision software for national security going up so much? 
The company has some traits of a meme stock – rising as retail investors seek to squeeze short sellers who borrow stock hoping to repay the loan at a lower price. 
Bulls are benefiting from superficial positives – the company has ‘ai’ in its name and appears to compete in the same market for government data analysis as does Palantir. 
There is also some genuine good news – such as a contract to deploy BigBear’s software in military exercises and national security and a partnership with Tsecond, a Silicon Valley startup, to create a battlefield AI solution for AI-enabled data solutions, noted Forbes.
The bears – who look at the company’s double-digit revenue declines, enormous losses, high dependence on a few government contracts, lofty valuation, and high volatility – also seem to have an excellent case.
After BigBear.ai’s disappointing second quarter 2025 report, the stock is likely to move significantly following its November 10 third quarter results come to light. Wall Street sees the stock as about 20% over-valued.
Read on to learn more about the company’s history, recent performance, bull and bear cases, and what analysts are saying.
In August BigBear.ai saw a bright future ahead following the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The legislation provides more than “$170 billion in supplemental funding to the Department of Homeland Security and $150 billion to the Department of Defense for defense technology,” directly aligning with BigBear.ai’s capabilities, CEO Kevin McAleenan said in a company release.
The company declined a request to comment. “BigBear.ai is currently in the 'quiet period’ before we announce our 3Q numbers on November 10th - so, as I’m sure you’ll appreciate, we are unable to comment,” noted an October 27 email from a company spokesperson.
BigBear.ai was formed in 2020 by a private equity firm that merged two companies and took the combined company public in December 2021. 
More specifically, AE Industrial Partners acquired systems integrator NuWave and data analytics firm PCI Strategic Management and took them public through a merger with a Special Purpose Acquisition Company, according to a company statement. 
Since then, the stock – roughly 18% of whose float is sold short – has lost about 25% of its value and now holds a stock market capitalization of nearly $3.1 billion.
BigBear.ai’s second quarter performance and prospects disappointed investors – sending the stock down 20%. Revenue has been declining in 2025 – falling 18% in the second quarter to $32.5 million, noted the company’s statement. 
Management cut its full year revenue forecast 22% to a ranged between $125 million and $140 million, noted a company release. This implied a 15% to 20% drop in revenue from 2024 – a big disappointment from the company’s original 7% revenue forecast, according to BTCC Academy.
Profitability has also deteriorated.  BigBear.ai’s net loss soared nearly 16-fold to $228.6 million – roughly 61% of which was due to a fair-value loss on convertible note derivatives. The company’s adjusted earnings before interest taxes, depreciation, and amortization more than doubled to $8.5 million, BTCC Academy noted.
The bull case for BigBear.ai stock hinges on the chance for short-term increases based on a heavily shorted stock with limited publicly-traded shares going up on any sliver of good news in the $70 billion (2030 forecast) market for AI defense applications, BTCC Academy wrote.
For example, when positive news, shorts rushing to cover can fuel price spikes. For example, on October 24, nearly 293 million shares traded – roughly three times the normal volume -- on the Tsecond contract news, reported Coin Central.
BigBear.ai has won contracts in civilian infrastructure. For instance, on September 11, the company introduced its veriScan biometric system at Nashville International Airport and on October 23 expanded to Chicago O’Hare – cutting international arrival processing from 60 seconds to 10 through the company’s facial recognition software, CoinCentral wrote.
Finally, BigBear.ai claims a solid backlog and a $390 million cash balance which could offset losses. The company – which raised cash recently – reports a $380 million contract backlog and hints at “several larger awards in the pipeline,” noted CoinCentral. While this backlog provides some revenue visibility, the actual funding and timing remain uncertain.
The biggest reason for BigBear bulls is momentum. The company is among 2025’s top-performing AI stocks with a devoted following of retail traders, according to Yahoo! Finance. 
The bear case for BigBear.ai includes inconsistent and declining revenue, significant losses, low margins, high valuation, and customer concentration.
While most of these negatives were mentioned above, three others are worth noting: high valuation, competitive threats, and recent insider selling – followed by which the company promoted its interim CFO to CFO.
BigBear.ai’s stock is way overvalued – selling at a price-to-sales ratio of 13. This figure does not make sense in light of the company’s declining revenues. What’s more, the valuation is 3.8 times the S&P 500’s price-to-sales ratio of 3.43, according to Multipl.
BigBear.ai competes in the AI defense market against much larger competitors such as Palantir – with revenue in the billions of dollars – and Anduril Industries as well as established contractors such as Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, noted CoinCentral.
Finally. there has been significant insider selling. Indeed the company’s former CFO Notably, on August 27, 2025, then-interim CFO Sean Ricker sold 11,980 shares of the company, according to GuruFocus. On October 14, Ricker was appointed CFO, noted a company filing with the SEC.
BigBear.ai stock is over-valued according to Wall Street. The average price target from three analysts is $5.83, according to TipRanks, making the company’s current price of $7.22 – 24% too high.
Optimists such as Rick Orford believe the company’s cash reserve and backlog give it the tools to eventually turn the corner, and they don’t want to miss out on a potential future “multi-bagger,” if BigBear successfully scales or adds a big contract or new technology partner, noted TipRanks. 
I would avoid this stock."

Meta is reorganizing its metaverse unit and shifting an executive who led the efforts to its AI division.Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth told employees on Monday in an internal memo, which was seen by Business Insider, that Gabriel Aul, who led products for its virtual worlds, Meta Horizon, and Ryan Cairns, who is in charge of Meta's virtual reality hardware, will now lead the company's metaverse bets.""The priority of the metaverse work remains unchanged, and it continues to be a companywide priority,"" Bosworth wrote in the memo. ""We've proved our thesis to the industry, and we continue to see competitors enter this space to try and catch up to us, so we need to continue to press our hard-earned advantage.""Vishal Shah, who helped lead its metaverse bets over the past four years, announced in another memo that he's transitioning to Meta Superintelligence Labs, according to a copy of the memo seen by Business Insider. Shah said he's taking on a new role as vice president of AI products in the Products and Applied Research unit within MSL and will report directly to Nat Friedman, one of MSL's leaders.
The reorganization of the metaverse team comes as the company's total investment in mixed and virtual reality is set to top $100 billion this year.
Meta confirmed the move with Business Insider.
Last week, Meta cut 600 jobs in its AI division, MSL, and also laid off employees in its risk organization, telling workers that their roles are being replaced by AI.

When a stock sports a dividend yield above its own historical average, one of two things has happened. 
The company may have raised its dividend – usually a good sign. Or, the dividend yield may have gone up because the stock’s price went down. That suggests there’s been bad news, but it hints at a possible bargain. 
Some investment professionals seek out stocks whose dividend yield is above their own normal level. Probably the best-known practitioner of this approach was the late Geraldine Weiss, who wrote a book called Dividends Don’t Lie. 
I wrote a column about the Geraldine Weiss approach in September 2024. The five stocks I selected returned 23.4% in the ensuing year, beating the Standard & Poor’s 500 at 17.6%. Those figures are total returns, both price gain (or loss) and dividends.
 Bear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn’t be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn’t predict the future.
 I’d like to give Weiss’s approach another try. Here are four stocks that look good to me now, based on her method. 
 The infamous Enron Corp., which went down in the flames of accounting fraud in 2001, has several surviving children. One is EOG Resources Inc. (EOG); the initials once stood for Enron Oil & Gas. 
Based in Houston, EOG produces the equivalent of more than one million barrels of oil a year. Its mix is about 31% natural gas and 69% oil and natural-gas liquids. 
Over the past ten years, EOG’s typical dividend yield has been about 1.8%. Today the yield is 3.7%. Geraldine Weiss fans, take note. 
EOG has been increasing its dividend rapidly in recent years. In 2019 the dividend was $1.01 a share. In the past four quarters the payout has been $3.77. 
Molson Coors Beverage Co., a brewer based in Golden, Colorado, has averaged a 2.5% dividend yield over the past decade. Today the stock yields 4%. 
The shares have done miserably over the past ten years, losing close to half of their value. Many investors think that beer is a buggy-whip industry. U.S. beer sales have been declining, and imports are grabbing an increasing share of a shrinking pie. 
Sensibly, Molson is trying to diversify away from beer, offering hard cider, hard seltzer, canned cocktails and energy drinks. 
These days, many investors think of Novo Nordisk AS (NVO), which is based in Denmark, primarily as a weight-loss drug maker. I, however, think of it primarily as a leader in diabetes medications. 
The stock peaked at about $147 last year, and has descended all the way to $53 as Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY) has moved to the front in weight-loss drugs. After its fall, Novo Nordisk shares yield 3.3%, well above the ten-year median of 1.9%. 
The company’s net profit margin is above 35% and its return on stockholders’ equity is about 81%. Even if those figures decline some, I think the stock is a bargain, selling for about 14 times earnings. 
Based in New York City, Interparfums Inc. makes and sells perfume and cologne under a wide variety of licensed brands, such as Coach, Karl Lagerfeld, Montblanc and Van Cleef & Arpels. Its dividend yield has normally been about 1.7%. Now it’s 3.2%. 
The stock has declined, partly because sales and earnings growth have slowed, and perhaps partly because investors fear a recession. It peaked at about $158 five years ago, and now sells for around $96. 
 I think the decline is overdone. Growth was still pretty good in the past year, with sales up 7% and earnings up 17%.
 My maiden column discussing Geraldine Weiss’s approach was encouraging, as three of my five picks beat the S&P 500’s return, and all five were profitable. 
 The best performer was UGI Corp. (UGI), which distributes natural gas, propane and electricity, mostly in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. It returned 43% (including dividends). 
 Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA) attracted a takeover offer from a private equity firm, Sycamore Partners. It returned more than 37%. 
 Also beating the index, but by a narrower margin, was Magna International Inc. (MGA), a Canadian auto parts maker. Considering the trade frictions (and other frictions) between the U.S. and Canada, I’m pleasantly surprised. 
US Bancorp. (USB) and Greif Inc. (GEF.B) returns 10% and 4% respectively, trailing the index. 
Disclosure: I own Novo Nordisk personally and for most of my clients. Katharine Davidge, my wife and a portfolio manager, owns EOG personally and for clients. "

Kenvue (NYSE:KVUE), the consumer healthcare spin-off from Johnson & Johnson, has experienced a significant decline in its stock price in recent months. The shares are currently priced around $15, which is more than 65% lower than their highs in 2023, as investors contend with legal uncertainties, management changes, and slowing sales growth. The question is whether this decline represents a worthwhile long-term buying opportunity or a potential value trap.
If you're looking for an upside with lower volatility than owning an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. This portfolio has reliably outperformed its benchmark, which consists of a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes, achieving returns greater than 105% since it was established. Additionally, see: What’s Happening With PLUG Stock?
The selling pressure began earlier this year when Kenvue issued cautious guidance, indicating lower-than-anticipated profit growth due to currency challenges and a decline in demand for cough and cold products. The company also underwent a leadership change, with CEO Thibaut Mongon resigning as part of a broader strategic review. Legal issues have further impacted sentiment: Kenvue is named alongside Johnson & Johnson in a lawsuit in the U.K. concerning alleged asbestos contamination in baby powder, bringing back investor concerns related to J&J’s ongoing talc litigation. Moreover, negative news connecting Tylenol — one of Kenvue’s most recognized products — to developmental problems in children has unsettled retail sentiment, despite the fact that the claims remain unverified.
However, beneath this turmoil, Kenvue’s core fundamentals remain solid. The company controls one of the most robust consumer health portfolios globally, featuring brands such as Tylenol, Motrin, Neutrogena, Aveeno, and Listerine. These brands enjoy wide global recognition, strong pricing power, and consistent demand even during economic downturns. Kenvue generates over $1.6 billion in annual free cash flow, has moderate debt levels, and maintains operating margins around 17%, providing it with the financial flexibility to navigate short-term challenges.
Valuation also appears attractive following the recent decline. With a market value of approximately $27 billion, Kenvue trades at a lower valuation than competitors such as Haleon and Procter & Gamble’s health division. Although earnings growth in 2025 is expected to be modest, a forthcoming strategic update from management could boost sentiment if it indicates credible plans for margin improvement or streamlining the brand portfolio.
Nonetheless, investors should manage their expectations. The legal and reputational issues will not disappear quickly, and the departure of the CEO introduces uncertainty regarding execution. Until the courts provide clarity on liability and the new leadership presents a long-term strategy, the stock may struggle to see a significant re-rating. The short-term trajectory could remain turbulent, especially if new lawsuits or political scrutiny arise.
Overall, Kenvue appears fundamentally undervalued, yet faces sentiment challenges. For long-term investors looking for stable cash-flow exposure in the consumer healthcare sector, the current dip may be appealing — as long as one is prepared to endure additional near-term volatility. In the near term, a more cautious approach might be to wait for a clear indication of a market bottom and a more transparent direction from management. However, over a 12- to 24-month outlook, Kenvue’s brand strength and cash flow generation suggest that this sell-off could ultimately represent a buying opportunity rather than a permanent decline.
To mitigate stock-specific risk while gaining exposure to upside, consider exploring the High Quality portfolio, which has reliably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its establishment.  Why is that? On average, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; offering a more stable experience as illustrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics."

Apple just launched the AirPods Pro 3 last month, but here’s the thing: you probably don’t need them. With the AirPods Pro 2 now available on Amazon for just $169 instead of the original $249, you’re looking at a serious bargain that makes way more sense than dropping $249 on the latest model.
The core reason people buy premium earbuds like these is simple: they want crystal-clear sound that blocks out the chaos around them, from noisy commutes to distracting coworkers. The AirPods Pro 2 absolutely nail that experience with Apple’s H2 chip delivering twice the noise cancellation of the original AirPods Pro, and the differences with the Pro 3 are honestly minimal for most users. Apple is clearing out inventory, so stock won’t last forever.
See at Amazon
The engine that powers these earbuds is the Apple H2 chip which analyzes audio at an incredible rate of 48,000 times per second to adjust the active noise cancellation. This also implies that instead of merely reducing noise, the earbuds will continuously monitor the environment around you so that they can remove any noise that disrupts your concentration or entertainment. The custom-designed driver, along with the amplifier, has resulted in clear, accurate sound that combines smooth highs and deep, resonant bass that does not exhibit any distortion.
Active noise cancellation on the AirPods Pro 2 will remove up to twice the background noise that the original AirPods Pro remove. This feature combines two microphones that listen for background noise outside and an additional microphone pointing inside your ear to monitor any noise that still manages to seep through. Then, using its H2 chip, it generates noise that cancels it out so that it doesn’t reach your eardrum.
The âTransparency mode,â on the other hand, presents an opposite scenario when thereâs a requirement for you to remain conscious of the surroundings. The same mic setup allows the entry of background sounds seamlessly so that you can conduct conversations or listen to road traffic without having to remove the earbuds from your ears. The âAdaptive Audio,â rolled out via software enhancements, combines noise-cancellation technology and âTransparency modeâÂ depending on the surroundings in use.
This allows for a personalized spatial audio system that tracks the userâs head dynamically. The system can use the true depth camera found in an iPhone to adjust the sound output based on the userâs different hearing characteristics. The sound will seem to emanate from specific locations in space while watching movies and music since it will remain stationary regardless of how the userâs head moves.
The four pairs of silicone tips that came along with the AirPods Pro 2 will provide a secure, comfortable fit that also helps create an acoustic seal. The acoustic seal is important for both noise-cancellation and bass. The free Ear Tip Fit Test can be found in your iPhone settings and can also help you figure out what size tips you need by testing how well it seals inside your ear canal. The unit has an IPX4 rating which means that itâs resistant to both sweat and water splashes.
Battery Life gives you up to six hours of listen time using ANC or up to 30 hours total using the USB-C MagSafe charging case, and can charge for five minutes to listen for an hour when you need a quick boost. The charging case has a speaker that plays sounds that, using the Find My app, can lead you to it, and also has a U1 chip that helps Precision Finding for location tracking.
With a price tag of $169, the AirPods Pro 2 provide tremendous value in relation to its competitors.

65,2025-10-27,"After a decisive win by La Libertad Avanza (LLA), international bonds and local stocks jumped while the peso strengthened against the US dollar.

Argentina’s bonds, stocks and currency are surging after President Javier Milei’s party won an overwhelming victory in a Sunday midterm election, a key requisite to keep economic reforms on track and a United States financial backstop in place.
On Monday, international bonds rallied between 9 and 13 cents each, local stocks jumped over 20 percent and the peso strengthened some 6 percent to the dollar, halving its initial rally.
Official results in Argentina’s Sunday legislative elections show voters strongly backed Milei’s free-market reforms and deep austerity measures, with inflation falling sharply since he took office nearly two years ago.
The unexpectedly strong showing came after the US pledged a combined $40bn to support Milei – a $20bn central bank swap line and a potential $20bn loan facility – and implied the backing was contingent on Milei’s reform agenda.
“His victory was so, so much larger than expected,” said Thierry Larose, portfolio manager at Vontobel Asset Management. “Previously he was in a state of survival, and now he’s … in a very strong position to try to form tactical alliances and push some reforms that were completely out of reach.”
The president’s party, La Libertad Avanza (LLA), received 41.5 percent of the vote in Buenos Aires province compared with 40.8 percent for the opposition Peronist coalition, according to official results. The province has long been a Peronist stronghold, marking a dramatic political shift. Nationally, LLA took over 40 percent of the vote, a much better-than-expected result.
 

 
“Critically, Milei’s victory speech was notably moderate and cooperative, signaling willingness to work with non-LLA legislators on reforms,” Christine Reed, emerging market fixed income portfolio manager at Ninety One, said in a note.
The country’s international dollar bonds were pushing against historic highs posted earlier this year, with the 2038 maturity up 13 cents to 73 cents on the US dollar.
US-listed shares of Argentine companies also surged, with financial shares rising up to 50 percent and the Global X MSCI Argentina ETF adding 20 percent, after falling 10 percent year-to-date through Friday. Stocks traded on US exchanges jumped 34 percent.
The peso initially strengthened as much as 13 percent to the dollar at 1,320 per greenback and was last 5.8 percent stronger on the day at 1,410.
The currency’s strength makes sense, especially with the backdrop of US support, according to Matthew Graves, portfolio manager for emerging markets debt at PPM America.
“The government has some breathing room now, and can take next steps from a position of relative strength,” he said. “We still think the FX bands are better used as a tool to facilitate a transition to more of a true managed-float FX framework. Investors will be keen to understand what this path might look like, and how it will facilitate a more rapid accumulation and rebuild of FX reserves.”
Argentina’s assets have been on a roller coaster ride since Milei’s party suffered a wider-than-expected defeat in a provincial vote in Buenos Aires last month.
 

 
The peso had weakened some 25 percent since mid-April’s partial scrapping of foreign exchange controls, and close to 30 percent since the start of the year. On Friday, it touched a record closing low of 1,491.50 per dollar.
Argentina’s international dollar bonds were among the worst-performing emerging market high-yielders this year to Friday, after having returned over 100 percent to investors in 2024
The local stock benchmark last month touched its lowest in a year. While it has since risen more than 20 percent, it is down nearly 30 percent from a record high set in January.
Now, the stronger position for Milei’s party in the legislature will encourage more investment, investors have said, as electoral risk recedes. It also boosts hopes for reform-minded candidates even in the next general ballot in 2027.
“The midterms yesterday just give a longer horizon for potential foreign investments, both in financial assets and in real assets,” said Graham Stock, senior sovereign strategist with RBC BlueBay Global Asset Management.
While some still anticipate a reform to the foreign exchange framework that would encourage the accumulation of reserves, with a wider band or a free float of the peso among the options, confidence in Milei’s reform outlook could naturally strengthen the currency, RBC’s Stock said.
Carmen Altenkirch, an emerging markets sovereign analyst at Aviva Investors, said the results could kick off a “virtuous cycle” in which locals begin selling dollars again.
“I think a stronger exchange rate is feasible,” Stock said, adding that depleted dollar reserves were a key weakness.
“They need to take advantage of peso strength to buy up dollars and build those reserves up, which they can do with the current regime,” he said.

66,2025-10-27,"For anyone who’s joined us for previous years, you’ll know that badge hacking and modification are core to the Hackaday Supercon experience. While you’re of course free to leave the badge completely stock, we encourage attendees to tear it apart, learn how it works, and (hopefully) rebuild it into something unique. There are even prizes for the best hacks.
As such, every decision about the badge’s hardware and software is made with hackability in mind. It’s why we always try to add an expansion port to the badge and, in recent years, have leaned into MicroPython to make it easier for attendees to modify the code.
But one thing that’s been largely missing in previous badges is aesthetic customization. Sure, you could strip out the firmware and write something entirely new, or hang some oddball peripheral off the side of the thing, but ultimately it still looked like the badge we gave you at the door. That’s because, at the end of the day, the badges are just PCBs. Short of designing your own enclosure (which has certainly been done), every badge looks the same. That is, until now.


This year’s badge is unique among Supercon badges because it isn’t just a PCB. It’s actually a stack-up of two PCBs! That might not sound like much of a distinction, but in this case, the front board has no electrical function — its only purpose is to hold the keyboard membrane against the dome switches on the rear PCB. The only reason we made it out of a PCB in the first place is that it was convenient and cheap at the scale we needed. But if those weren’t concerns, it could just as easily have been 3D-printed or cut out with a laser or a CNC router.
While the necessities of running two hacker cons on opposite sides of the planet within a couple of months of each other meant we needed to think at scale, attendees are free to do whatever they want between now and when they get their badges on Friday. Want to carve a front panel out of aluminum on your CNC? Awesome. Perhaps laser-cut some thin plywood and give it a nice stain for that old-school look? We love it. Want to see what that fancy multi-material 3D printer you’ve got is capable of? So do we.
Want to make the 2025 Hackaday Supercon badge your own? Just head over to the “hardware/mechanicals_and_models” directory in the badge’s GitHub repository and you’ll find STEP, DXF, and SVG versions of the front panel. We’re eager to see some wild and wonderful front panels, but there are a few things to keep in mind:
If you’ve got other questions or need some assistance, leave a comment below or check in on the #badge-hacking channel in the Hackaday Discord server. See you at Supercon!

Good sound matters most during the moments when music becomes the backdrop to your life. Game day gatherings with friends, cooking marathons in the kitchen, cozy living room hangouts during these cold months or even impromptu dance sessions when your favorite track comes on. You need a speaker that can keep up with your energy without constantly dying or worrying about spills.
The Beats Pill has been a favorite for years, and Amazon just dropped it to an all-time low of $99 instead of the original $149. This iconic capsule-shaped speaker is being cleared out at a price that makes sense for what you get.
See at Amazon
The 2024 Beats Pill went through a complete internal redesign focused on one goal: bigger, cleaner sound. At the core sits a reengineered racetrack woofer that uses stronger neodymium magnets to drive 28 percent more motor force compared to the previous Beats Pill Plus. This increased power lets the woofer displace 90 percent more air volume, which translates directly into deeper bass that you can actually feel. The woofer’s innovative structure includes ridges and contours designed to minimize low-end distortion even when you crank the volume to maximum.
The tweeter is encased in its own secure compartment to provide additional support that helps prevent unwanted vibrations. The tweeter’s compartment allows it to produce clear highs and full-bodied middle tones without disruption from the motion of the woofer. The speaker unit itself is tilted at an angle of 20Â°, ensuring that sound waves reach your ears instead of the floor or any piece of furniture in front that could absorb them. This feature allows Pill to perform better than its 8.6-inch size by sounding larger.
Bluetooth 5.3 increases connectivity functionality when compared to the previous version and offers quicker pairing, greater range and more stable connectivity. The Beats Pill comes equipped with Class 1 Bluetooth and offers the range advantage that standard Bluetooth speakers lack. This allows you to move from room to room or outside without having to worry about the sound suddenly cutting off. The speaker has quick pairing capabilities for both iOS and AndroidÂ so it will automatically recall your device for easy reconnecting. The Find My and Find My Device integration feature for both iOS and Android also assists in tracking the location of the speaker using your smartphone.
Battery life has also improved to reach an impressive 24 hours of playback at 50 percent volume which is double what the previous model offered. With the improved battery life, the speaker can last through an entire day without requiring a recharge. Fast fuel charging has also improved functionality and offers up to two hours of playback time when charged for only 10 minutes if you need to leave for an important engagement.
The IP67 rating is also a serious level of protection for resisting the elements: This level of certification allows the speaker to withstand immersion beyond 1m for 30 minutes without any issue, while still blocking ingression from dust. The added sealing helps resist ingress from sand, dirt, and water. The silicone grips securely on smooth surfaces, making it resistant to slipping, and the lanyard cord allows for effortless carrying.
At this price point, the Beats Pill are among the best portable Bluetooth speakers on the market.

Ken asks:
I was reading on Reddit about the performance of the latest Google Pixel, and now I am more confused than ever. It sounds like a lot of people consider the Google Tensor a mid-range processor that underperforms where it counts. It's time for me to buy a new phone, so I was wondering what you thought.
Is the Tensor just a mid-range Samsung copy, or is it a good processor?

Thanks
Oh boy, talk about opening a can of worms!
I know what you mean and have seen the arguments for and against the Pixel line of phones, including those centered around a recent article saying it's the consumer's fault for not understanding why Google uses the Tensor SoC.
What do I think? Well, I think the whole thing is the result of a valid question that has turned into two-sided fighting on the internet for fighting's sake. People love to attack what they don't have and defend what they do, and that's never helpful. It's not really our responsibility to understand why companies make the decisions they make, only to buy what we think offers the best value.
 



What everyone needs to remember is that Google didn't decide to design a chip and use it for no reason. The company also isn't trying to win any social media arguments about chip wars. It wants to further its business model — that's eyeballs on the internet — and is using its own line of products to help make it happen.
Of course, it would love to have a profitable phone division and make money there, too. That means getting more out of a product than was spent to build it, ship it, and market it. While people arguing at Reddit may draw some attention, it's not ever going to dictate Google policy.
A few short years ago, Google needed the Tensor if it wanted to start this phone AI trend. Google needed an engine that could power what nobody was trying to do, and the Tensor was the answer.
Raw performance (outside AI processing) or graphics benchmarks were never major factors, so Google went cheap. It worked, and sales of Pixel devices, as well as user response, have been on a nice upward trend.
 



That was then, this is now. MediaTek and Qualcomm both sell smartphone chips that do everything Google needs today, and Apple's chip can handle more than the iPhone ever could. These chips are only going to get better, too. Google doesn't have to have a specific and proprietary NPU design inside its phone chips in 2025, like it did in 2021.
But if doing so means things can be ""good enough"" when it comes to smartphone things or games, while being great when it comes to AI and saving a lot of money building it all, why not continue?
Google could use the latest Snapdragon chip to deliver the same AI performance while enabling more of those smartphone tasks — or, better yet, longer, more immersive gameplay. That would cost a lot more because that chip isn't cheap.
 



Remember, a Pixel 10 Pro XL starts at $1,199. While that's an absurd amount of money to charge for a phone (in my opinion), it's the new price for a big fancy flagship phone. That's about what you're going to pay for an iPhone 17 Pro Max or a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.
You should buy the model that works well for what you want it to do. Don't worry about what other folks are buying or why, because it won't affect your own experience. Google is the one that needs to manage the balance between price, AI possibilities, and performance in other areas, while your job is easier: buy what you like.
The Pixel 10 is powered by Google's custom Tensor G5 chipset, which was manufactured by TSMC using a 3nm process.
Tensor G5 provides a 60% more powerful TPU (compared to the Pixel 9) and 34% faster on average CPU (compared to Tensor G4), promising better performance and enabling more on-device AI capabilities for the Pixel 10 series.
More on-device AI processing means less data has to be sent to the cloud to make features work. This not only protects your data but it also means features run more efficiently and use less battery.
Google positions the Tensor as a flagship chipset, even though it uses it in its mid-range Pixel A-series phones to improve performance and AI processing. Benchmarks also reveal that CPU and GPU performance still lag behind competitors, while excelling in AI performance.
 




All the AI you could need
It's the same price as other popular flagship phones, but it's the best phone you can buy when it comes to AI capabilities today and the immediate future. Not built for pure performance, it still has a lot to offer.

A strike at Boeing's F-15 and F/A-18 factories in the Midwest is stretching into its third month, prolonging one of the longest walkouts in company history.
About 3,200 workers at three Boeing facilities in Missouri and Illinois have been on strike since early August, boycotting work at the plants that build and maintain the US military's F-15 Strike Eagle, the F/A-18 Hornet, and some missile technologies.
The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union said on Sunday that its members have voted to reject Boeing's latest contract offer, adding that the offer ""disrespects"" the skilled workers who keep America's arsenal flying.
The union also said that the disruption ""continues to threaten military readiness.""
""Boeing claimed they listened to their employees — the result of today's vote proves they have not,"" said the union's president, Brian Bryant. ""Boeing's corporate executives continue to insult the very people who build the world's most advanced military aircraft — the same planes and military systems that keep our servicemembers and nation safe.""
""It's well past time for Boeing to stop cheaping out on the workers who make its success possible and bargain a fair deal that respects their skill and sacrifice,"" Bryant added.
Union leaders have pushed Boeing to raise retirement contributions, offer wage increases that keep pace with inflation, and match the $12,000 ratification bonus the company granted to commercial airplane workers in the Pacific Northwest who went on strike last year.
The union said that the new arrangement would have cost Boeing an additional $50 million over four years, which is ""about half the cost of a single F-15 fighter jet that IAM Union members produce.""
Boeing said on Sunday it was disappointed by the latest outcome and that the vote was narrowly decided.
""The union's statement is misleading since the vote failed by the slimmest of margins, 51% to 49%,"" Boeing said in a statement. ""We are turning our focus to executing the next phase of our contingency plan in support of our customers.""
The company added on its website that it was increasingly hearing from workers ""who want to cross the picket line"" and ""understand the value"" of their offer.
Boeing said its latest counteroffer includes a general wage increase of 24% over five years, added vacation and sick leave, a retention bonus of $1,000 after four years, and Boeing stock of $3,000 that vests over three years.
It also offered workers a ratification bonus of $3,000.
Boeing and the union did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.
The strike's continuation comes just days before Boeing is expected to report on its third-quarter earnings on Wednesday.
Its defense, security, and space business contribute to roughly a third of the company's revenue, and places Boeing among the US federal government's largest military contractors.
The company faced another, far larger strike last fall, which involved 30,000 of its machinists in the northwestern US who rejected their labor contract. That strike lasted seven weeks and ended in early November 2024.
In an earnings call in July, Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg said the scale of this latest strike was ""much, much less"" than last year's.
""I wouldn't worry too much about the implications of the strike. We'll manage our way through that,"" Ortberg said.
The company said on its website that production across all St. Louis sites in Missouri is continuing with its non-striking employees. The company's St. Louis facility, as its primary military aircraft manufacturing hub, is expected to be a key site for building the new sixth-generation F-47 air superiority fighter.
The striking machinists also work on the T-7A Redhawk, a training fighter jet, and the MQ-25 Stingray, a new aerial refueling drone for the US Navy that is still in testing.
The picketing also coincides with an effort by Boeing to burnish its image after a series of major safety incidents affecting its commercial airliner business.
The manufacturer has been weighed down by three high-profile crashes since 2018 involving its 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner aircraft, as well as an infamous mid-flight door plug blowout in January 2024.
The Trump administration's awarding of the F-47 contract to Boeing was seen as a major victory for the planemaker amid its reputation struggles.

Elon Musk could leave Tesla as CEO if his proposed $1 trillion pay package is not approved, Board Chair Robyn Denholm has warned.
The appeal was sent in a letter to shareholders of the electric car company on Monday. It comes ahead of Tesla’s November 6 annual meeting, when shareholders are expected to vote on the proposed pay package, the largest of its kind.
Tesla’s board has faced repeated criticism for not acting in shareholders’ best interests, and governance experts and advocacy groups have questioned its independence and oversight of Musk’s influence.
The proposed performance-based plan was designed to retain and motivate Musk to continue leading Tesla for at least another seven and a half years, Denholm said in the letter.
 

 
Musk’s leadership is “critical” to Tesla’s success, she said, and warned that without a plan that properly incentivises him, the company could lose his “time, talent and vision”. Musk’s role is vital as Tesla seeks to become a global leader in artificial intelligence and autonomous technology, she said.
The proposed package would grant Musk 12 tranches of stock options tied to ambitious targets, including a market capitalisation of $8.5 trillion and milestones in autonomous driving and robotics.
Denholm’s letter portrays the package as necessary to align Musk’s incentives with shareholder value and long-term growth, also urging investors to re-elect three long-serving directors who have worked closely with him.
Tesla’s board has been under scrutiny for years over its close relationship with Musk. A Delaware court earlier this year struck down his 2018 pay deal, finding it was improperly awarded and negotiated by directors who were not fully independent.
Last week, Proxy firm Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services urged shareholders to vote against the pay package. Proxy advisers often sway major institutional investors, including the passive funds that hold large stakes in Tesla.
Despite the letter, Tesla stock is on the rise. At 11am in New York (15:00 GMT), it is up 3.1 percent.

 Qualcomm is joining the competition to supply chips for AI data centers. 

 Qualcomm (QCOM), which has largely focused on chips for mobile phones, laptops and other consumer devices to date, on Monday unveiled two AI accelerator chips for data centers: the AI200, which is set for release in 2026, and the AI250, which is planned for 2027.

 Shares of Qualcomm were up more than 13% in recent trading, pacing gainers in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. With Monday's gains, they've added about one-quarter of their value in 2025.

Qualcomm's expansion into the market for data center chips comes as a growing number of companies look to capitalize on booming demand for AI with products catering to data centers. The share prices of many of those companies have surged, helping power the broader stock market to record highs.
 The move marks a big step for Qualcomm, which said that it will be committed to a data center roadmap with an annual cadence for major releases or updates going forward.

 It could also mean more competition for leading AI chipmakers such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), with several analysts suggesting in recent weeks that they see Nvidia's dominant market share diminishing over time as competition and demand grows.

 Shares of Nvidia were up 2.5% in recent trading amid a broader market rally, while AMD shares were up slightly after hitting an all-time high at the open.

 From Matthew Graham at Mortgage News Daily: Mortgage Rates Perfectly Flat to Start The WeekMortgage rates fell to the lowest levels in a month last Tuesday and barely budged through the rest of the week. Now, at the start of the new week, the average lender is perfectly unchanged from last Friday. This means there are only a small handful of days with meaningfully lower rates going all the way back to late 2022.

As the government shutdown continues, the bond market (which dictates rates) continues missing out on the bulk of relevant economic reports that normally help guide momentum throughout the month. [30 year fixed 6.19%]

Shares of GameStop surged more than 7% in premarket trading early on Monday morning after the White House boosted a social media post made by the video game retailer with an AI-generated meme of President Donald Trump. 
The retailer’s X account, which regularly posts memes about video game culture, made one such post on Saturday night, declaring that the “console wars” were over after Microsoft announced plans to release the flagship Xbox game “Halo” on rival Sony’s PlayStation 5.
On Sunday night, the White House’s official X account reshared GameStop’s X post, featuring an apparent AI-generated image of Trump saluting the American flag outside the White House while donning the armor of Halo's protagonist, the Master Chief.
The White House post is captioned “Power to the Players,” GameStop’s official slogan.
The White House’s “Rapid Response” X account also chimed in on the meme, suggesting that this was the ninth war Trump had stopped—echoing the president’s claims that he has ended eight wars since taking office.
The GameStop account has since responded with its own meme posts depicting Trump and Vice President JD Vance in the Halo universe.
In pre-market trading early on Monday, GameStop’s share price rose to $25.03, up 7.4% from Friday. The popular meme stock has been volatile so far this year, and its price is down 25.65% since the start of 2025.
The tongue-in-cheek post made by GameStop on Saturday declared that the “console war” began in the early 2000s, “with the release of Halo: Combat Evolved as an Xbox-exclusive title,” and it has now ended. Last week, Microsoft announced that it was remaking the first entry in Xbox’s flagship sci-fi shooter franchise under the title “Halo: Campaign Evolved,” which will release in 2026. Aside from Xbox and Windows, the remake will also be available on Sony’s PlayStation 5, making it the first Halo title to hit Microsoft’s rival console. Big flagship first-party titles like Halo are usually exclusive to the publisher’s own platform, but Microsoft has been moving away from this model as its Xbox consoles have struggled to compete with the PlayStation 5 and Nintendo’s Switch 2 in sales. During the announcement, Xbox also said that future Halo titles will also be released on PlayStation. 
According to our estimates, GameStop CEO and Chairman Ryan Cohen—who owns nearly 8.2% of GameStop shares—has a net worth of $5.3 billion.

                Argentina's President Javier Milei celebrates after winning in legislative midterm elections in Buenos Aires,  Argentina, Sunday, Oct. 26, 2025.

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina — Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei won decisive victories in key districts in midterm elections Sunday, clinching a crucial vote of confidence that strengthens his ability to carry out his radical free-market experiment with billions of dollars in backing from the Trump administration.
In the election widely seen as a referendum on Milei's past two years in office, his upstart La Libertad Avanza party scored over 40% of votes compared with 31% for the left-leaning populist opposition movement, known as Peronism, exceeding analysts' projections.
Milei, a key ideological ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, said his party and allied blocs picked up 14 seats in the Senate and 64 in the lower house of Congress on Sunday, bolstering the government's support in the legislature enough to uphold presidential vetoes and block impeachment efforts.
At La Libertad Avanza headquarters late Sunday in downtown Buenos Aires, a beaming Milei hailed the election sweep as a mandate to press forward with his spending cuts and introduce ambitious tax and labor reforms. The results also automatically position him as a candidate for reelection in 2027.
""The Argentine people have decided to leave behind 100 years of decadence,"" Milei exulted as his supporters cheered, referring to a succession of Peronist governments that brought Argentina infamy for its inflationary spirals and sovereign debt defaults.
""Today we have passed the turning point. Today we begin the construction of a great Argentina.""

                A woman holds a banner reading in Spanish, ""Trump or homeland,"" outside former President Cristina Fernandez's home, where she is serving a six-year house arrest sentence for corruption, after polls closed during legislative midterm elections in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Sunday, Oct. 26, 2025.

Perhaps never has an Argentine legislative election generated so much interest in Washington and Wall Street.
Trump appeared to condition a $20 billion currency swap deal with Argentina's central bank and an additional $20 billion loan from private banks on a good showing for Milei in national midterms, threatening to rescind the assistance for the cash-strapped country in the event of a Peronist victory.
""If he wins we're staying with him, and if he doesn't win, we're gone,"" Trump said after welcoming Milei to the White House earlier this month.
Those contentious comments added to mounting pressure on Milei, who has scrambled to avert a currency crisis since the Peronist opposition won a landslide victory in Buenos Aires provincial polls last month. Argentina's bonds and currency nosedived as markets sensed that the public was losing patience with Milei's reforms and that the midterm race would be tight.
To stem the run on the peso, Milei burned through billions of dollars in foreign exchange reserves to shore up the peso. In an extraordinary move, the U.S. Treasury then came to the rescue, selling dollars to help meet soaring demand for greenbacks and finalizing the credit line.
In the end, the Peronist alliance performed poorly, underscoring how weak the once-dominant movement has become in the Milei era, largely as a result of internal divisions. Markets were widely expected to rally on Monday.
""For foreign investors, this outcome is a relief because it shows that the Milei program can be sustainable,"" said Marcelo J. García, the America's director for the geopolitical risk consultancy Horizon Engage.
""It leaves the opposition weakened and fragmented, just as it was when Milei won the presidency in December 2023,"" Garcia added.
The Peronist coalition has struggled to channel rising public anger with Milei's painful austerity measures into a new political strategy after delivering the economic shambles that the chain saw-wielding outsider inherited in late 2023.
Trump, while on his way to Japan on Monday, posted on Truth Social that Milei was ""doing a wonderful job"" after his party beat expectations in midterm elections.
""Our confidence in him was justified by the People of Argentina,"" Trump wrote.
Milei responded to Trump's post, calling him ""a great friend"" of Argentina and thanking him for ""trusting the Argentine people.""
The results showed Milei's young libertarian party gaining support across the country — including in some surprising corners that have long been under the sway of Peronism.
In the closely watched Buenos Aires province, a Peronist stronghold home to nearly 40% of the electorate, La Libertad Avanza eked out a razor-thin victory Sunday. Just last month, the Peronists beat Milei's party there by a whopping 14 percentage points.
Axel Kicillof, governor of Buenos Aires province and the most influential elected official in the Peronist opposition, criticized Trump for putting his thumb on the scale.
He warned that the billions of dollars in financial aid from the U.S. Treasury and investment banks would do nothing to help ordinary Argentines squeezed by Milei's cuts to subsidies or forced out of business by a contracting economy.
""I want to make it clear that neither the U.S. government nor JP Morgan are charitable societies,"" he said. ""If they come to Argentina, it is for nothing other than to take a profit.""
With Milei's efforts to deregulate the economy and scrap tariffs winning over Argentina's powerful agriculture sector, La Libertad Avanza also swept Santa Fe, which dominates soybean production and processing, and Córdoba, another powerhouse farming province.

Despite Milei's new momentum, experts caution that the irascible president still needs to court political allies to see through his agenda. Given the limited number of seats up for grabs in this election, it was mathematically impossible for Milei to secure a majority in either house.
""This victory is necessary, but not sufficient to maintain control of Congress,"" said political consultant Sergio Berensztein. ""The government must build a broad and effective coalition with like-minded forces.""
Seeking to capitalize quickly on Sunday's results, Milei said he called the country's powerful provincial governors to accelerate agreements on long-term economic reform.
Sunday's outcome will also test public patience for Milei's cost-cutting measures in the coming months. Although Milei's budget cuts have significantly driven down inflation — from an annual high of 289% in April 2024 to 32% last month — the price increases still outpace salaries and pensions.
The electorate appears increasingly polarized between beneficiaries of Milei's reforms and those who say they're struggling to make ends meet like never before.
In the financial district of Puerto Madero, luxury car dealerships report sales surging since Milei scrapped import restrictions. Streets bustle with bankers who praise the president for ending a yearslong ban on selling dollars online. Fine restaurants serve Argentine oil executives who gush about his efforts to draw foreign investment.
But at a soup kitchen on the other side of Argentina's Riachuelo River, Epifanía Contreras, 64, said she feels like she's bearing the brunt of the cutbacks.
""You can't live on 290,000 pesos a month with today's inflation,"" she said, describing how her $200 monthly pension has shriveled in value since Milei cut cost-of-living increases. ""The situation is getting worse and worse.""
Reflecting widespread public resignation, electoral authorities reported a turnout rate of just under 68% Sunday, among the lowest recorded since the nation's 1983 return to democracy. Voting is compulsory in Argentina.
""I vote out of obligation, nothing more,"" said Matías Paredes, 50, a real estate broker whose foreign clientele vanished with Milei's strong exchange rate. ""None of these figures inspire optimism. We're just choosing the lesser evil.""

18-year-old Lance Yan recently made his location on X to ""Waterloo | SF.""
The University of Waterloo student founded Clice, an AI startup. Yan recently visited the Bay Area to raise capital. He can also stay at a hacker house when he visits, he told Business Insider, which justified the bio change.
""If you're trying to raise, and a VC sees you're based in SF, they could be like: 'Instead of calling me, just meet me in person,'"" Yan said. ""The negotiations would come smoother.""
Yan said that he wanted to associate himself with San Francisco's startup culture — something many tech hopefuls can relate to. As the city booms with AI money, so does its online cachet. Tech hopefuls can tout San Francisco on social media in an effort to get closer to investors, build connections, or manifest success.
Business Insider spoke with tech workers about why San Francisco fever is spreading online — and how they're inching closer to the city, digitally.
When I called 35-year-old Margin founder Cathleen Turner, her X bio listed both Los Angeles and San Francisco. She had recently spent over a month in the Bay Area, where she told people that she was ""strongly considering moving.""
Turner said that investors were ""overindexing"" on signals. ""A lot of SF investors, they will not take someone seriously if someone has not moved,"" she said.
San Francisco, long a tech mecca, is on the up-and-up once again. The city's real estate market is experiencing a boom period, and local hiring is surging in part due to AI. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang declared over the summer that the city was ""back.""
Toki Hossain, a 28-year-old working in developer relations in Vancouver, noticed that people online would ""go to SF once and change their location forever."" He said he wondered if he should do the same for his coming trip.
The following week, Hossain hosted a Canadian diaspora night in San Francisco. He kept his location as Vancouver, but posted a photo of San Francisco's trolleys on arrival.
24-year-old a0.dev cofounder Seth Setse lives in San Francisco. He said he's noticed a younger crop of X users claim his city as home: college students.
Interns will move to the Bay Area for the summer, change their bios, and leave their listed city as San Francisco for the following year, Setse told Business Insider. It's for clout on ""tech Twitter,"" he said; the interns want to ""engage with other people in SF and get more people to respond to them.""
San Francisco fell out of favor among some in tech during the pandemic; tech leaders and VCs criticized local politicians. Some de-camped to Austin or Miami. Others who left during the pandemic have since moved back.
27-year-old Snoofer founder Antonio Song said he never wanted to move to the city. Thanks to his X feed, he now has ""real big FOMO,"" he said.
22-year-old cyber engineer Jack LaFond loves his city: Tampa. He's noticed that when some tech people visit San Francisco, they often bash their home cities online.
""People see the all-or-nothing side of SF and think that, by denouncing their own city and pledging allegiance to SF, that will put them ahead in a cohort of tech people,"" LaFond said.
Many of these SF flaunters online appear to come from one spot: the University of Waterloo.
The university has a strong tie to Silicon Valley thanks to its co-op program. In 2014, a Riviera Partners study found that the UWaterloo ranked third among the most hired candidates for Silicon Valley engineering jobs, behind UC Berkeley and UCLA. The city itself is also one of Canada's tech hubs.
23-year-old Gale cofounder Haokun Qin said that online San Francisco allegiances were ""very pronounced in Waterloo culture."" Qin saw someone change their LinkedIn location for a remote internship at a San Francisco-based company, he said.
Clice's Yan described the structure at Waterloo: study for four months, intern for four months, and do it all over again. He's planning to do his internships in the Bay Area, ""so basically I'm spending 50% of my time in Waterloo and 50% of my time in SF,"" he said.
Yan said that San Francisco was a ""heavenly land"" for Waterloo students. The philosophy on campus was ""Cali or bust,"" he added.
Dreaming of the Bay goes far beyond Waterloo's campus, though.
Caleb Jephuneh's location on X is ""2025: moving to Silicon Valley."" The 24-year-old founder of Therabot from Nairobi, Kenya, said that he had ""outgrown"" his city.
""Putting it there, someone else who has an easier way can actually help me move to San Francisco,"" he said. ""It's more of a manifestation.""

‘Where the hell is the market risk?’
– Scott Bessent, United States Secretary of the Treasury
 
Whenever I hear policymakers point to rising markets as proof that their “policies are working,” it makes my Spidey-sense tingle. It should do the same to yours.
The current moment in time feels especially confusing. Crosscurrents of all-time highs in stocks, gold, Bitcoin, and real estate are offset by a range of aggressive – and potentially problematic – policies.
What’s an investor to do amongst all of these conflicting drivers?
My advice: Think about this moment in the broadest terms. Understand that where we are today is dependent upon where we came from and the route we took to get here. Recognize that two seemingly contradictory things can be true at the same time – markets can hit all-time highs in the face of policy decisions that are risky, but have worthy goals, while simultaneously seeming increasingly reckless, or raising the possibility of a recession, market crash, or worse.
Think back to January 2025:
-Markets had been enjoying a robust move upwards since bottoming in March 2009, with all indices breaking out to new all-time highs in 2013. The 2020 pandemic brought a 34% crash and an immediate “V-bottom” Q1 and Q2 of 2020.
-Massive fiscal stimulus during the pandemic (and afterward) on top of ZIRP’s ultra-low rates (until 2022) was highly constructive to higher equity and real estate prices.
-Artificial intelligence had been around for decades, grew rapidly in the 2010s, but it exploded after the introduction of ChatGPT in November 2022. That saw a massive surge in AI-related CapEx.
Oh, and the newly elected president, known as a fan of deregulation and tax cuts. Of course, the market entered 2025 hot as a pistol. The circumstances at the start of this year were so robust that well-regarded economists claimed there was a “0% chance of recession in 2025.”
Boiling the Frog: Since the year began, both the substance of policy and the implementation style have given investors pause. Liberation Day was a disaster, sending stocks into freefall. The only thing that halted the crash was the 90-day pause. That gave investors time to get used to a fairly radical tariff policy, unlike anything seen since the 1930s. The impact was muted (so far) because imports of goods are a relatively modest share of the overall economy.
There are lots of positives occurring, and these include:
Positives
All-time Highs Stocks, Crypto, Housing and Gold
Robust Economy
Tax Cuts
Lots of Capital availability
Mortgage Rates are falling
S&P500 Profits at all-time highs
Deregulation
Artificial intelligence will make companies more efficient
Private credit is broadly available
Inflation has off its 9% highs to 3%
The Federal Reserve is Cutting (ST) Rates
But there seems to be just as many negatives, and they are accumulating:
Negatives
Tariffs are an inflationary drag on economy;
They Alienate Allies and Trading Partners
Deficits continue to widen
Inflation remains sticky above 2% target
On/Off Policies Discouraging (Non-AI) Capex
Non-farm payrolls have fallen to barely positive
Firing Head of BLS (Kinda Legal?) and Fed Governor (Not Legal?)
Rollout of Tariffs was sloppy and poorly planned
Sending troops into cities divisive (perhaps illegal?)
Exec Branch Tariffs are unconstitutional (Article I, Section 8)
Challenge to Judicial Review and Rule of Law
US Population to have annual decrease for 1st time in history
Shut down amid political paralysis
Sentiment is extremely negative
I continue to see strong market gains and robust profits, even as economic activity decelerates and signs of stress appear.
As I noted in February of 2025, the odds of an avoidable, self-inflicted policy error continue to rise. For now, all-time highs in prices and profits outweigh all my other concerns.
But at a certain point, the frog will be boiled, and despite all of the positives, eventually, a mistake will lead to the trend cracking. Until then, we can only watch the data and wait…

Asian equities had a strong day, as most markets rose more than 1% after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the US Trade Representative, and China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng reached a “preliminary consensus” following two days of negotiations.
The underlings have teed up an agreement for the big bosses Trump and Xi to sign on Thursday in South Korea. China’s Renminbi (CNY) rallied versus the US dollar to 7.10 per US dollar. In addition to easing trade tensions, another factor was the 15th Five Year Plan’s emphasis on AI, technological independence, and semiconductors, as growth stocks led gains in both Hong Kong and Mainland China.
Hong Kong volumes were higher, though not significantly, in an indication of the skepticism of trade talks, despite the China underweight in many portfolios. Hong Kong’s most heavily traded stocks were mega-cap growth stocks, led by Alibaba, which gained +3.15%, Tencent, which gained +2.90%, CATL, which gained +1.45%, and BYD, which gained +1.63%. Meanwhile, semiconductors outperformed, and non-ferrous metals rebounded (precious metals and metals and mining subsectors), due to reports saying that Mainland gold dealers will hike gold prices despite weakness in the spot price.
Biotech contract research organization WuXi AppTec gained +4.07% (2359 HK) in Hong Kong and +2.73% in Mainland China (603259 CH) on Q3 financial results that beat analyst expectations, with revenue up +15.3% year-over-year (YoY) and net income up +82.9% YoY.
Like in Hong Kong, growth stocks, sub-sectors, and stock exchanges all outperformed led by technology hardware, semiconductors, software, non-ferrous metals, and healthcare.
The 2025 Financial Street Forum kicked off, as PBOC President Pan Gongsheng, Li Yunze from the China Bank and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC), China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) Chairman Wu Qing, and Foreign Exchange Administrator Zhu Hexin all gave keynote speeches. Gongsheng’s speech reiterated easy financial conditions, stating that the central bank will “…continue to adhere to a supportive monetary policy stance, implement appropriate loose monetary policies, comprehensively use various monetary policy tools, provide short-term, medium-term and long-term liquidity arrangements, and maintain relatively loose social financing conditions.”
The CBIRC head stated the agency will focus on “expanding domestic demand. We will strengthen the supply of funds for major projects and boost consumption expansion and upgrading. ”

Industrial Profits increased in September, according to an official data release overnight, up +21.6% YoY, which brought the year-to-date (YTD) YoY increase to +3.2%, bolstered by a strong September move by high tech manufacturing, which increased +8.7% YoY.  Not a factor in today’s trading but noteworthy.
Sunday’s New York Times Business Section included an article titled “Will Silicon Valley’s China Obsession Pay Off?” by Li Yuan. The article included this sentence: “Part of the reason American tech leaders amplify China’s capabilities, or its threat, is to pressure Washington into squeezing their Chinese peers with tariffs and regulation, and to win federal funding. By framing China’s rise as an existential challenge, they can push the government to pour money into their industries. The more they can alarm U.S. politicians and the public, the greater their leverage, and the more power they ultimately gain.”  There are far more industries that this thesis could be applied to, other than technology, which ironically has many companies that are dependent on China for a good chunk of their revenue.

Former Ford CEO Mark Fields said on Friday that demand for EVs in the US will slowly pick up again after the Trump administration axed federal EV incentives in September.
""You're going to see, obviously, a pullback given that the federal incentives have come off, but I think you're going to see gradual growth in the EV market,"" Fields, 64, said in an interview with CNBC.
Fields said that in the long term, consumers will lean toward clean energy vehicles instead of combustion-engine vehicles because ""oil is a non-renewable resource."" 
""So you're going to see these grow over time, but it's not going to be at the pace that the automakers thought,"" Fields said. ""That's why you're seeing these big impairment charges that both Ford and GM and others have taken.""
On October 14, General Motors said in an exchange filing that it was taking a $1.6 billion charge ""based on a planned strategic realignment of our EV capacity."" The automaker said it expected the ""adoption rate of EVs to slow"" after federal EV incentives expired on September 30.
""I think you're going to see more going forward as the industry adjusts to a new demand curve, if you will, for EVs,"" Fields continued.
Representatives for Fields did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.
Under the Biden administration, EV buyers could receive a $7,500 consumer tax credit when they bought a new EV and a $4,000 credit for a used EV. The Trump administration ended both schemes.
Fields was Ford's CEO from 2014 to 2017. He joined the company in 1989 after graduating with an MBA from Harvard Business School. Before becoming CEO, Fields held various senior leadership positions and was Ford's chief operating officer from 2012 to 2014.
Earlier this month, Fields said US automakers had overestimated consumer demand for EVs and ""went full bore"" into making them.
""What was an advantage, at least they thought at the time, has now probably turned into a bit of an albatross as the market take-up of EVs is going to be lower, at least in the near to medium term, than they plan for,"" Fields told CNBC in an interview that aired on October 14.
Former Tesla president Jon McNeill took a different view from Fields. McNeill was Tesla's president for global sales and marketing from 2015 to 2018. He said in an interview with CNBC on October 2 that the expiry of federal EV incentives won't slow down the US EV market.
""In Europe, France and Germany in particular rolled subsidies off a couple of years ago, and what happened after that, surprisingly, was the market continued to grow,"" McNeill told CNBC.
""The market's established, and we're probably ready to have a market that can grow without subsidies,"" he added.
Ford's current CEO, Jim Farley, said at a conference in Detroit on September 30 that the pullback on federal EV incentives could halve US EV sales.
""In the near term, I believe EV adoption will now only be about 5% of the US market, but this is going to grow, especially for affordable EV vehicles,"" Farley said in an earnings call on October 23.
Ford's shares are up nearly 40% year to date.

85,2025-10-27,"The numbers did not compute.
Even before Terry Rozier dropped out of the 2023 NBA game in which he's accused of rigging his statistics, computers at an ""integrity monitor"" firm flagged a flood of bets that did not match a mathematical model of how this game should go. The company, now called IC360, alerted the NBA and sportsbooks about the unusual bets coming in on Rozier's performance.
The investigation that led to the arrest of the Miami Heat point guard and dozens of others for illegal gambling started with math. It ended Oct. 23 with Rozier charged with manipulating his performance in that 2023 game so that gamblers in the know could win tens of thousands of dollars.
Beep. Boop. Busted.
Federal authorities allege more than $200,000 poured in betting that Rozier would turn in a below-average performance in that game after Rozier told another defendant he would drop out of the game early with an injury. Rozier played 9 minutes, 34 seconds for the Charlotte Hornets in the game against the New Orleans Pelicans before leaving with an injury and finished under his usual totals for points, assists and 3-pointers.
Earlier this year, similar mathematical models flagged unusual betting on individual pitches thrown by Cleveland Guardians pitchers Emmanuel Clase and Louis Ortiz. Both were placed on indefinite leave.
Detection starts with prediction. 
""When you do the odds compiling, you have a predicted model for how you expect the game to go,"" said Chris Rasmussen, who teaches sports integrity at the University of New Haven and has spent years investigating sports betting fraud for the World Lotteries Association.
Based on the data behind the teams and players in the game, the model expects certain points for those players and predicts “expected behaviors.” When real-world betting behavior starts to deviate from the model’s prediction, that’s when “we are starting to look,” Rasmussen explained. “Why does it deviate, and how much does it deviate, and what's going on?”
Bookmakers, the businesses or platforms that take bets on sporting events, often work with integrity monitors like IC360 that analyze sports and betting data across the market and flag unusual activity.
“It’s not necessarily the sportsbook’s job to prove cheating,” said Frank DiGiacomo, an attorney who practices law in gaming, sports betting, and lottery. “Their obligation is to flag a situation and report it.” Then, state regulators could launch investigations with law enforcement.
The monitoring model analyzes expected behavior and tracks outliers, numbers outside the expected range, whether they come from events in the game itself or from people placing unexpected bets on it. Then the model signals when it detects something more than luck at work.
A new account placing a maximum bet immediately raises red flags. ""That's really weird,"" Rasmussen said. A new bettor would probably place $10, $15 or $20 in a new account, he said, not thousands of dollars.
Similarly, if an existing account that typically bets $50 on certain games suddenly places a $1,000 bet, that outlier behavior could trigger an investigation.
“Of course, you can be lucky one time,” Rasmussen said. “But if you keep being lucky, there’s probably something in it.”
Since the Supreme Court overturned the federal ban on sports betting in 2018, 39 states plus Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico have legalized some form of sports gambling.
With hundreds of thousands of bookmakers today, Rasmussen said cheating in sports betting is harder to catch because there are more betting opportunities. While bettors once could only bet on major games, they can now bet on games from college sports to eSports, and there are more ways to hide.  
""The criminals are working 24/7,"" he said, ""and we in law enforcement and so on are working ... not the same as the criminals.""
Rasmussen emphasized the importance of human monitors to identify cheating, even though algorithms and artificial intelligence can process vast amounts of data. 
""You still need a human behind,"" he said. ""You really need to understand the betting market... You need to understand what prop bets, the handicap, and so on mean, and you need to understand that there's also the local aspect… There’s a difference from Chicago to LA to New York.""
Prop bets, which stand for proposition bets, allow bettors to wager on specific events or outcomes within a game rather than the final result—betting on who scores first, for example. Or whether Terry Rozier performs under his average stats. Or whether Louis Ortiz will throw an outside slider.
To DiGiacomo, the sports betting lawyer, a ""fundamental trust that the games are fair and results are fair"" is the core of the sports betting industry.
""Otherwise, people will not bet if they think the match is rigged,"" he said.
If a gaming operator fails to notify a regulator, the consequences can be warnings, fines, and ultimately losing their license. ""Licenses are their lifeblood, so operators take that seriously,” DiGiacomo said.
The same goes for players, but the consequences can be severe and career-ending. Given the salaries professional athletes could earn today, ""losing years or perhaps being banned from a sport is a significant financial penalty, probably, I would assume, more significant than what they could win on a bet,"" he added.
With Rozier's arrest making headlines, athletes ""will certainly, or should certainly"" know that they're not going to be able to get away with the regulated sports betting system, DiGiacomo warned.
""It's a sad day for sports and for sports betting,"" he said. ""But I would say, this is the system working.""

While campaigning for president, Donald Trump made a stop at the Bitcoin 2024 conference to establish himself as the candidate who would fight for the rights of Bitcoin users and embrace this new financial technology. However, âShitcoin Presidentâ is a more apt representation of his actions thus far.
Just this past week, Trump pardoned Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng âCZâ Zhao, who had been serving prison time due to the crypto exchangeâs relaxed approach to anti-money laundering enforcement. Prior to the pardon, Binance made a $2 billion deal that also involved World Liberty Financial, which was co-founded by members and affiliates of the Trump family. The deal is expected to lead to tens of millions of dollars in revenue for the Trump familyâs crypto project. According to a Financial Times investigation, Trump-affiliated crypto companies have made $1 billion over the past year.
On top of that, several major entities in the crypto industry, such as Coinbase and Ripple, were also included in a list of donors to Trumpâs White House ballroom project that was released this week.
Of course, the TRUMP memecoin was also launched around the same time Trump was inaugurated as the 47th President of the United States, along with a MELANIA memecoin that launched a few days later. A recently filed lawsuit claims that Melania Trump was used as âwindow dressingâ for a scam perpetrated by other parties.
The TRUMP memecoin was part of a controversy regarding access to the president, as a Trump-attended dinner was held for the top holders of the memecoin earlier this year. On top of that, the TRUMP chart does not look good for those who bought the memecoin around the time of the inauguration.
Trumpâs activities in crypto are mostly par for the course when it comes to that industry, as what started as a way of decentralizing the global, digital financial system with Bitcoin has evolved into much of the same sort of centralized, rent-seeking profiteering found in the legacy banking system. While there have indeed been some measures implemented by the Trump administration that benefit Bitcoin, itâs clear that the crypto-grifting and stablecoin focus has overshadowed those policies related to the original peer-to-peer digital cash system.
Under the Trump administration, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has made it easier for banks to deal with crypto assets like bitcoin (it was just announced that even JPMorgan will accept bitcoin and ether as collateral for loans) and the cypherpunks were thrown a bone with the release of political prisoner and convicted Silk Road operator Ross Ulbricht. This is in addition to a variety of other pro-Bitcoin stances that have been supported by executive order, but not yet enshrined by congressional legislation. That said, there has been a lot of additional crypto baggage that has come along with these positive developments for Bitcoin.
While the Biden Administration was perceived by the crypto world as far too anti-Bitcoin for much of its reign (until a sharp reversal near its end), the pendulum has now perhaps swung too far in the opposite direction, where crypto grifting and centralized rent-seeking via stablecoins and decentralized-in-name-only blockchains are too easily embraced.
Crypto people should consider the possibility that Gary Gensler isn't all that bad and they've fallen for propaganda from the likes of Coinbase and Ripple.
Do you think these crypto companies want to fight for you or exploit you?
— Kyle Torpey (@kyletorpey) January 14, 2025

Crypto exchanges and token issuers claimed they were fighting for the rights of crypto users when supporting the Trump campaign, but the reality is these centralized entities also had a clear financial interest in making sure the speculation built around memecoins, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and stablecoins was allowed to continue.
The acceptance of this sort of activity has become so blatant that there are worries that Sam Bankman-Fried (of FTX collapse infamy) could also receive a pardon, which is being resoundingly rejected by even the crypto industry as a bad idea. Prediction market Kalshi currently puts the odds of an SBF pardon this year at 14%.

hereâs my take

Much of the rhetoric from the Trump White House has been focused on the use of blockchain technology to continue the economic dominance of the United States and the U.S. dollar via stablecoins. The popular use of stablecoins in the developing world is seen as a way to increase demand for U.S. treasuries, which have become less popular as the growing national debt remains an unresolved issue. Major purveyors of stablecoins regularly keep U.S. treasuries in their reserves to back the stablecoins, so increased demand for stablecoins means increased demand for US debt. This focus on continued dollar dominance is reflected by the fact that the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act has already been signed into law.
While former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler was routinely mocked by crypto users and industry leaders for his stance on the emerging market during his time at the regulatory agency, many of those who are mainly focused on Bitcoin have pointed out that the current regime is in many ways worse due to the perceived acceptance of unsavory crypto projects and increasing centralization in the ecosystem.
Here is an insider's written account of the power structures controlling Ethereum — through Vitalik, his inner circle, the massive premine, and the Ethereum Foundation.

WhenÂ searching for a signal amid the noise surrounding crypto under the Trump administration, the reality is that the desires of Bitcoin enthusiasts are being ignored. There are still no legally enshrined protections for open-source developers and node operators, and no tax exemption on bitcoin use in payments, which wouldÂ put it on equal standing with foreign currencies. Even the status of the often-touted Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, which is not necessarily viewed positively by all Bitcoin proponents due to the inherent centralization of custody involved, remains unclear.
That said, the passage of a crypto market structure bill, which may include some of the above-mentioned protections for Bitcoin users, is still expected to occur this year. Itâs still the first year of Trumpâs second term in office, but the administration will need to change course if it wants to be remembered for embracing Bitcoin rather than shitcoins.

Today, in the Calculated Risk Real Estate Newsletter: Final Look at Housing Markets in September and a Look Ahead to October Sales
A brief excerpt: After the National Association of Realtors® (NAR) releases the monthly existing home sales report, I pick up additional local market data that is reported after the NAR.  This is the final look at local markets in September.

There were several key stories for September:

• Sales NSA are down 0.2% YoY through September, and sales in 2024 were the lowest since 1995!

• Sales SAAR (seasonally adjusted annual rate) have bounced around 4 million for almost 3 years.

• Months-of-supply is above pre-pandemic levels (this is the highest level for the month of September since 2015).

• The median price is up 2.1% YoY, and with the increases in inventory, some regional areas will see further price declines - and we might see national price declines later this year or in 2026.

Sales at 4.06 million on a Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate (SAAR) basis were at the consensus estimate.

Sales averaged close to 5.32 million SAAR for the month of September in the 2017-2019 period. So, sales are about 24% below pre-pandemic levels.
...
In September, sales in these markets were up 7.8% YoY. The NAR reported sales NSA were up 8.2% year-over-year in September (close).

Important: There were one more working days in September 2025 (21) as in September 2024 (20). So, the year-over-year change in the headline SA data was lower than the NSA data suggested (there are other seasonal factors).
...
 More local data coming in November for activity in October! There is much more in the article.

Last week, Valve released an update to Counter-Strike 2 that crashed the value of many of the rarest skins in the game, wiping billions of dollars off the entire ecosystem overnight. However, that might not be the end of the story, with many expecting another market crash to arrive in the coming days. 
The update last week that resulted in the massive market crash allowed Counter-Strike players to trade in five lower value items and in return get one higher value item, such as a knife or gloves, which have always been some of the rarest items in the game. This obviously tanked the value of the knifes and gloves you could now get, with many players crafting them and choosing to sell on the Steam Marketplace immediately. 
This created a massive increase in volume of trades on the Steam Marketplace, as players looked to buy items they needed to trade up, and players purchased rare knifes and gloves as soon as they became available. However, with many of these items still going for hundreds of dollars despite the crash, some will have been looking to cash out on external sites to get real money from their items rather than Steam cash. Any items that were sold on an external platform will have a seven-day trade cooldown, which will now expire in the coming days. 
There is a consensus among traders on forums that once the seven-day trade cooldown on these new items clears, prices could once again drop as many more items that were snapped up during the market instability are relisted. That should start to happen late on Thursday, and another price drop could be incoming. 
However, there is some potentially good news for those holding skins, as many people who are expecting another price drop are preparing to buy items on Thursday as the prices drop. If enough people do this, there could be a jump in price thanks to the rise in demand. This obviously depends on what the market does, but one thing is for sure, there is likely more market instability coming towards the end of this week. 
While the CS skins economy has recovered slightly over the weekend, many Counter-Strike 2 fans are still angry over the loss in value of some of their rarest items. There has never been a change quite like this in the world of CS, so exactly how this will play out remains to be seen, although it seems unlikely that the market will recover anytime soon. "

 Another bank is getting gobbled up.

 Huntington Bancshares (HBAN) has become the latest financial firm to snap up a smaller bank with its planned $7.4 billion all-stock purchase of Cadence Bank (CADE). Shares of Cadence advanced about 3% Monday, while Huntington's fell 4%. The KBW Nasdaq Regional Banking Index was recently edging lower on an upbeat day for stocks broadly.

 Huntington joins Comerica (CMA), PNC Financial Services Group (PNC), and Pinnacle Financial Partners (PNFP) on a list of recent multibillion-dollar financial-services deals. Comerica was bought by Fifth Third, PNC purchased FirstBank, and Pinnacle acquired Synovus.

 The Huntington-Cadence deal, expected to close in the first quarter of 2026, gives Cadence investors 2.475 shares of Huntington stock for every share they own, which values Cadence shares at $39.77 based on Huntington’s Friday close. That’s a 9% premium to Cadence’s price to finish last week. 

Huntington Bancshares is expanding its footprint with a $7.4 billion planned all-stock acquisition of Cadence Bank, boosting its presence in Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, and Arkansas. The deal joins recent multibillion-dollar mergers involving Comerica, PNC, and Synovus as regional banks continue to combine.
 Ohio-based Huntington said the merger with Houston- and Tupelo, Miss.-based Cadence will give it substantial deposit market shares in Dallas, Houston, and all of Texas. In addition, Huntington will become the largest bank in Mississippi and a top 10 bank in both Alabama and Arkansas by deposits.

 In total, Huntington will have locations in 21 states, and 12 of the top 25 metropolitan statistical areas in the U.S. CEO Steve Steinour said the move is “an important next phase of growth” for the bank. 

 Shares of Cadence Bank are 10% higher year to date. Huntington Bancshares shares are down 4% for the year.
