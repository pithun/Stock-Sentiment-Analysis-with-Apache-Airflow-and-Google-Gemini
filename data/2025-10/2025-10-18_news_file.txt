Sometimes when you get the bag, you are also, literally, getting the bag.
The secondhand market is a bright spot for luxury. The global resale market is growing three times as fast as the firsthand market and is expected to reach as high as $360 billion by 2030 — up from between $210 billion and $220 billion today — according to a report by BCG and Vestiaire Collective released this month.
Handbags reliably drive luxury secondhand sales. The nearly 8,000 respondents to BCG and Vestaire's survey said that an average of 40% of their handbags were purchased secondhand — an outsize share, given that, on average, 28% of their total closets were purchased secondhand.
""A classic handbag is a classic handbag is a classic handbag,"" Lara Osborn, the SVP of merchandising and fulfillment at luxury secondhand retailer Fashionphile, told Business Insider. She said that bags tend to be more evergreen in style than clothing or shoes, handle wear better, and are generally one-size-fits-all.
They also tend to hold their value, something customers are ""now trained to think about,"" Osborn said.
Many seek out handbags with original packaging — down to the tissue paper — and authentication materials, knowing that will make it easier to resell them down the line, she said.
According to the BCG and Vestaire survey, 41% of secondhand sellers offload their pieces to recover residual value, and 62% sell so they can shop more.
While a select few handbags can be resold at a price higher than their retail value — marking a true return on investment — most customers, Osborn said, aren't looking for that when they ""invest"" in a bag.
A shopping win is ""when you can buy, use, and enjoy it, and sell it at some point and get a big portion of your money back,"" she said. ""You own a piece of capital that you can apply to something else; it's money in your closet, sitting and waiting to be spent.""
The bags most likely to retain their value are also among Fashionphile's top-selling. These are generally considered ""safe styles"" and ""heritage icons,"" according to Fashionphile's 2025 Ultra-Luxury Resale Report.""
""The appetite is just for timeless, classic,"" Osborn said. ""I'm not going to look out of place carrying this in a year, two years, three years.""
These are three of Fashionphile's top-selling evergreen bags that will add capital to your closet.
Fashionphile's top-shopped bag of the year is the Louis Vuitton Speedy.
The nearly 100-year-old style has been a reliable staple for decades, Osborn said. It comes in a number of sizes and iterations, something which fuels a collector's mindset — and continued purchasing.
""It's like, oh, here's the newest version,"" she said. ""Are other people collecting it? And then you start to think, 'I'm supposed to do that too.'""
The Speedys available on Fashionphile range in price from $615 to $12,875. The top-handle style, purchased new from Louis Vuitton, starts at $1,920.
Originally designed by Karl Lagerfeld in the 1980s, Chanel's classic Flap bags are iconic: the double C clasp and a chain strap laced with leather. Not only was it the second most-purchased bag overall at Fashionphile this year, but it was also popular across all generations.
Elements of the style have since extended to wallets and smaller crossbody bags, which are among Fashionphile's top-sellers in their respective categories.
The Double Flap commands a higher price point than the Speedy. On Fashionphile, it ranges from $2,080 to $33,075, and purchased from Chanel, the Flap bag starts at $5,500.
With Louis Vuitton and Chanel, Hermès rounded out Fashionphile's top brands of the year.
While the more expensive Birkin and Kelly are the most famous styles from the French house — and can often command more on the secondhand market than at retail — the Evelyne was the brand's top seller at Fashionphile and is a practical evergreen option.
""It's a really popular city bag,"" Osborn said. ""That's another one where you could buy it at full price plus tax and wear it a little bit and probably get most of your money back.""
At Fashionphile, the Evelyne ranges in price from $1,720 to $5,095. Only one Evelyne is listed for purchase on Hermès' website, at $2,425.

If you’ve been around LEGO collecting for any amount of time, you know the deal: Star Wars sets are the crown jewel of the entire catalog, the most popular licensed theme LEGO has ever produced, and discounts? They’re about as rare as finding a mint condition Boba Fett mini-figurine at a garage sale.
That’s what makes this current Amazon deal so unique: The Millennium Falcon 25th Anniversary edition just hit an all-time low of $67, down from $84. This is a commemorative piece celebrating a quarter-century of LEGO Star Wars magic, and seeing it at this price is the kind of opportunity that doesn’t come around often.
See at Amazon
There are 921 pieces in the set and the final product is an accurately detailed replica of the Millennium Falcon exactly as it appeared in the first movie, A New Hope. All the important details are there: the celebrated cockpit where Han and Chewie plotted the movie’s famous narrow escapes, the satellite dish that’s almost as iconic as the ship and those cannons mounted cheek by jowl to blast TIE fighters to pieces. Details are incredibly fine giving the mid-scale size of the build: you can’t quite hide them away but they’re not so big that they’re nothing but eye candy.
The included stand isn’t just functional: it tilts the Falcon at a dynamic angle that makes it look like it’s banking through an asteroid field or making the jump to light speed. The stand features a nameplate and a commemorative LEGO Star Wars 25th Anniversary brick, and turns this from a simple model into a proper collectible piece. At 5 inches high, 9.5 inches long, and 7.5 inches wide when mounted, it strikes that perfect balance between being substantial enough to showcase and compact enough to find a home on a bookshelf.
The set itself provides that elusive LEGO experience adults seek: substantial enough to be compelling over the course of multiple building sessions but not so gigantic that it’s a months-long affair like the 7,500-piece Ultimate Collector’s Edition. It’s included within LEGO’s Starship Collection, an individual line aimed specifically at adult builders who want display-worthy models but not furniture-sized builds. Over the course of several pleasant evenings, the 921 pieces come together to provide that calm and focused building experience that’s become one of the key attractions of adult LEGO sets.
For the price, it’s an affordable way to get into Star Wars collecting if you’re new to the franchise or an automatic purchase if you’re an existing fan. As a gift set, it’s perfect, the box presentation is high-end and the ages 18+ warning is an indication the set is aimed at adult sensibilities. At an all-time low price, this won’t be around long, so now’s the time to make the jump if you’re looking at this Falcon.

This week, the world's leading financial institutions were acting like bad roommates. All it took was one multibillion-dollar ""cockroach"" for everyone to start pointing fingers and assigning blame.Two years ago, Blackstone's President Jon Gray said private credit was in a ""golden moment,"" and it has since become the hottest corner of Wall Street. There have always been private credit critics, but a deluge of digs from industry watchers turned the spotlight back on the so-called shadow lenders, challenging their shining narrative and raising uncomfortable questions about potential contagions.It kicked off on Tuesday, when Jamie Dimon, Wall Street's bluntest banking billionaire, said something he ""probably shouldn't say,"" about the bankruptcies of auto parts giant First Brands and subprime auto lender Tricolor during JPMorgan Chase's earnings call.""When you see one cockroach, there's probably more,"" Dimon said, after the bank disclosed a $170 million loss related to Tricolor.And even though Dimon clarified that Tricolor, a company that offered financing for used cars to customers with limited or no credit history, is not typically what one would consider private credit (and may even involve fraud) and that there are ""early signs"" that there may be ""some excess"" in this 15-year credit bull market more broadly, many of the biggest private credit players took the comments from their longtime critic personally.Blue Owl co-CEO Marc Lipschultz suggested that the focus on private credit may be a result of some people in the industry having their own ""meaningful, parochial interests"" to protect in the face of private credit's growing popularity, which is eating their lunch.""Blackstone's market cap exceeds the market cap of most financial institutions in the world today,"" he said at the CAIS Alternative Investment Summit conference. ""It's not as if that's not coming from someone, and of course, those people don't like it.""When the interviewer, Bloomberg TV's Dani Burger, suggested ""those people"" might be Dimon, Lipschultz smirked. He suggested that the focus on private credit in these cases is an ""odd kind of fear-mongering.""
On Thursday, two regional banks, Zion Bancorp and Western Alliance, revealed losses in their own lending books, which has added to fears that the credit ecosystem might be under threat.
And critiques of private credit continued to pile up from there.
A study by business school academics at Johns Hopkins and UC Irvine claimed the industry's returns are ""illusory"" and fail to beat the market, or make the lack of liquidity worthwhile. And at the International Monetary Fund's annual meeting, the organization's head, Kristalina Georgieva, told reporters that the significant growth of non-bank lending has her organization ""urging more attention to the non-bank financial institutions,"" which are less regulated than banks.
""You are asking the question that keeps me awake every so often at night,"" she said.
Jeff Hooke, an adjunct instructor at Hopkins, told Business Insider that his study doesn't suggest that private credit is about to cause a crisis, but it's not favorable to the industry's narrative either.
""I don't see a few bankruptcies as a prelude to contagion,"" Hooke said. ""What my colleagues and I concluded is simply that the value that private credit claims for its asset class is simply not there.""
Private credit, shorthand for non-bank lenders that have moved in to offer the loans that banks stopped underwriting after the Great Financial Crisis, has grown immensely since the bottom of the crisis.
They're not just competing with banks on risky loans, but also writing multi-billion-dollar loans to investment-grade clients, a practice known as direct lending. Already booming before interest rates began to rise in 2022, the segment became the star of the investment world, offering high returns while banks pulled back.
Some of the private equity industry's most famous firms now actually manage more debt than private equity, with Blackstone managing $407 billion in non-real estate credit and $389 billion in private equity as of Q2 of this year. Apollo is even more lopsided, with $690 billion in credit assets and $150 billion in equity strategies. It's gone from a sleepier sidekick of the private equity investment world to a destination career for many future Wall Streeters.In a report titled ""Has the Golden Age of Private Credit Lost its Shine?"", private market investors Hamilton Lane asked whether the good days are over. Its analysis suggested that there's still ""room to run"" in the golden age, but the fact that they have to answer concerns shows that questions abound.Glenn Schorr, an analyst for Evercore who covers JPMorgan and large alternative investing firms, said that a few bankruptcies are not the same as an impending financial crisis, and that some people may have ""misread"" Jamie's comments.
""Every indication from bank commentary, from alternative asset firms' commentary, and from Moody's head of private credit, tells you that we're not seeing signs of a turn in credit,"" Schorr said.
""Make no mistake about it, that does not mean there will be zero loss,"" he added. ""If defaults go up 1% to 2%, one person might say 'big deal — 2% defaults are low'. Other people can say defaults have doubled.""
When Apollo CEO Marc Rowan was asked at a conference on Tuesday about the two bankruptcies, he said that it ""does not surprise"" him that there are some ""late-cycle accidents."" He suggested that the ""competitive market"" may have led some to take ""shortcuts.""
Rowan implied that this may be a sign of where the market stands, rather than a sign of any imminent concerns about the overall public or private credit markets. Other executives were more explicit in defending private credit.
""What's interesting is both of those were bank-led processes,"" Blackstone's Gray said at the same conference. He said he does not think ""this was a canary in the coal mine."" The firm is reporting results next week and may expand on this further then.
Also at CAIS, Carlyle Group CEO Harvey Schwartz noted that neither bankruptcies are related to ""what you think of as direct lending or the traditional private credit market.""
And while the big publicly traded alternative investment providers have taken a beating due to credit concerns, banks have had their own set of woes.
Jefferies, which holds debt tied to First Brands, saw its stock slump as questions mounted on what went wrong — though it clawed back some ground Friday.
Zions Bancorp dropped 11% Thursday after revealing a $50 million loss on two commercial loans, and Western Alliance slid 10% after disclosing a lawsuit alleging a fraudulent credit line to Cantor Group V LLC. Both stocks have since recovered.
To hear the private credit industry tell it, there aren't nearly as many cockroaches in their own loan books.
""We've been a little surprised by the First Brands, Tricolor sell-off and buzz because when we look at our credit portfolios, we actually see pretty healthy portfolios relative to almost any metric that you can look at,"" Kipp deVeer, co-president of Ares, said during a panel at CAIS.
Maybe shadow banks aren't so shadowy after all, they said.
""Private markets get referred to often as sort of like the shadow,"" Carlyle's Schwartz said during his panel. ""I've never seen a shadow this bright ever in the history of time.""

XRP experienced one of its sharpest derivatives market resets this month as billions in open interest were wiped out within days.
XRP currently trades at $2.35, up over 6% in the last 24 hours, after an extremely volatile week that saw the asset plunge from $2.50 to $2.20. Despite the rebound, XRP remains down 25% over the past month and trades nearly 39% below its all-time high of $3.84.
According to data from CryptoQuant, the recent move represents a full-scale market reset, as speculative positions were purged across the board. Between October 6 and October 18, total Open Interest (OI) in XRP futures crashed 65.5%, falling from $2.9 billion to just $1 billion.




This represents a massive $1.9 billion in liquidations and capital outflow from the derivatives market. Meanwhile, Binance, the largest venue for XRP futures, bore the largest chunk of the wipeout as its OI plunged from $1.32 billion to $480 million.

Interestingly, analysts at CryptoQuant describe the move as a long squeeze cascade, where the initial price drop triggered forced liquidations of overleveraged long positions, compounding sell pressure and driving the market lower in a feedback loop.
The 4-hour XRP chart reveals a falling wedge pattern, typically a bullish reversal formation. After testing the lower trendline near $2.20, XRP has begun to consolidate toward the upper boundary of the wedge, currently hovering around $2.35.
Immediate resistance lies at $2.50, a breakout above which could open the path toward $2.75 and $3.10. Meanwhile, support levels remain at $2.10 and $1.90; a breakdown below could reignite bearish momentum toward $1.70.

On the other hand, momentum indicators are neutral with RSI at 44.48, indicating mild recovery potential. The MACD is flattening near zero, and CMF (+0.04) hints at slow capital inflow after heavy outflows.
CryptoQuant analysts call this a “market full reset,” indicating that the market now stands at a healthier baseline. Despite being at a major crossroads, XRP remains one of the best crypto to buy in 2025, gaining more than 300% in the past year.

The $1.65 trillion chip giant Broadcom cut staff earlier this week.
The cuts on Thursday affected staff largely in sales, as well as customer success, account management, and solutions, according to LinkedIn posts and a person familiar with the matter. 
It's unclear how many roles were affected.
Broadcom has been making rolling cuts at the company, including at software firm VMware, which it acquired in late 2023. VMware's workforce has been slashed by roughly in half, Business Insider reported earlier this year. Broadcom has also been increasing prices on VMware's products. 
Broadcom has benefited from the AI boom by designing chips to power the technology. It first reached a trillion-dollar market cap late last year. On Monday, it inked a strategic agreement with OpenAI for 10 gigawatts of custom AI accelerators.
Broadcom did not respond to a request for comment.

The defense primes have a fresh challenge on their hands: A US Army that's tilting ever more toward a start-up-friendly, fast-moving procurement system.
US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll said on Monday that the military needs to rapidly overhaul its procurement processes and reduce its dependence on the largest defense contractors.
""We cannot f---ing wait to innovate until Americans are dying on the battlefield,"" Driscoll said in his remarks at the annual meeting of the Association of the United States Army in Washington.
""We must act now to enable our soldiers. Our window to change is right now, and we have a plan to do it. We will set the pace with innovation, and we will win with silicon and software, and not with our soldiers' blood and bodies,"" he added.
Driscoll told meeting attendees that the military will be announcing changes to the way equipment is purchased ""in just a matter of weeks."" He added that a Silicon Valley approach, which combines ""venture capital money and mentorship with startup culture,"" would be ""absolutely ideal for the Army.""
""We are going to completely disrupt the system that held the Army back for decades and lined the primes' pockets for so long,"" Driscoll said.
""We will break down barriers until we measure acquisitions, not in years and billions, but in months and thousands,"" he added.
Representatives for the US Army did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.
Prime defense contractors are companies that have direct contracts with the government. They include major aerospace players such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing, as well as arms makers like General Dynamics.
Since taking office in February, Driscoll has called for a revamp of the military's procurement processes. Driscoll served in the Army from 2007 to 2011 and was an officer with the Army's 10th Mountain Division in Iraq.
In an interview with Business Insider in April, Driscoll said Washington has ""optimized for nearly everything other than the soldier in their decision-making.""
""What has occurred is a hollowing out of a lot of the tools that we have given our soldiers,"" Driscoll said.
During an appearance on the ""TBPN"" podcast in May, Driscoll said he would consider it a ""success if in the next two years, one of the primes is no longer in business, and the rest of them have all gotten stronger.""
The largest arms makers have the expertise to design classified systems to the military's needs and the advanced manufacturing to build them at scale in the US. They often rely on subcontractors to integrate the sophisticated systems and their computerized displays and controls.
These projects face an inherent strain: They must be built rapidly enough for current missions but with sufficient capability to remain effective in a war that could be decades into the future.
It's a lengthy process that has been consolidated to a smaller number of major companies since the end of the Cold War. And it is this system that the Defense Department wants to widen to new players and speed up.
Silicon Valley titans, who specialize in rushing new digital services to the market, have also criticized the defense establishment.
""The Pentagon recently failed its seventh consecutive audit, suggesting that the agency's leadership has little idea how its annual budget of more than $800 billion is spent,"" Elon Musk said in an op-ed he cowrote with biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy for The Wall Street Journal in November.
Musk and Ramaswamy wrote the op-ed as co-leaders of the White House DOGE office. Ramaswamy left DOGE in January, and Musk left in May.
In the US, some major weapons developments by primes have been marked by severe delays. This includes Lockheed Martin's F-35 program, which was mired in controversy, delays, and rising costs. The United States Government Accountability Office in 2023 said the program that builds three versions of an advanced stealth fighter was ""more than a decade delayed and $165 billion over its original plans.""
Jets still arrive late. In 2024, all of the F-35 Lightning II stealth fighters delivered came late, with an average delay of 238 days.
Other big projects involving primes that are facing delays include Boeing's KC-46 Pegasus aerial-refueling tanker and the US Navy's Virginia-class submarine program with General Dynamics Corp. and Huntington Ingalls Industries.
Driscoll did not elaborate on what a new procurement system looks like, and the Pentagon has gutted its weapons testing office that independently assesses programs. The US military would likely still need many of the products made by primes. They are often the most advanced items a military buys, which is why they can be more vulnerable to issues than when companies work on smaller systems or single components.
Many US defense contractors lack commercial sales, making them wholly dependent on government spending. Huntington Ingalls Industries, for example, is the only American shipbuilder with the facilities and expertise to build nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.
An F-35, for example, has thousands of parts, and is a multinational project, with parts coming from allies like the UK and the Netherlands.
The defense market may be most open to new players in software and expendable drones, where barriers to entry are much lower.
Ukraine, hailed by allies as successful at manufacturing small drones to defend itself against Russia, still wants the big-ticket items like armored vehicles and missiles from allies, with its less-powerful assets alone unable to do much more than keep Ukraine on the defensive.
But its fight has still inspired Western industry. A host of new defense companies have emerged in response, and many major Western defense contractors have initiated new partnerships to acquire cutting-edge technology, work more efficiently, and address capacity gaps.
Jerry McGinn, the director of the Center for the Industrial Base at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Business Insider that while startups could make inroads into arms manufacturing, it will be difficult for them to beat the incumbents.
McGinn was the principal deputy director in the Office of Manufacturing and Industrial Base Policy at the Department of Defense from 2015 to 2018, where he oversaw acquisition policy.
""You've got to have a strong technical workforce, so there are significant barriers to entry there, but you have seen companies get involved,"" McGinn said.
""The big example, of course, is SpaceX and Blue Origin. They disrupted the space launch business by coming in with their model, but it is hard to do,"" he added.
Driscoll's calls for quicker industry processes are in line with those of Silicon Valley and the views of US allies abroad.
And Driscoll's push for cost-cutting means the market will adjust accordingly, says McGinn.
""If the government says, 'We want more commercially oriented drones that they're simple to make, that cost a hundred thousand dollars or less,' companies are going to do that, and some companies that may not be competitive for them, they won't bid,"" he said.
""This is very much a monopsony, where the government sets the market. The companies are going to be competitive, and they are going to try to respond. They will partner with other companies to make themselves more competitive,"" he added.
In May, Meta announced it is partnering with the defense technology startup Anduril to build next-gen extended reality gear for the US military. Anduril said the project was ""funded through private capital, without taxpayer support,"" and would ""save the US military billions of dollars."" This program has suffered from years of delays and problems.
Meta's CTO, Andrew Bosworth, described the collaboration as a ""return to grace"" for Silicon Valley's ties with the military.
US allies have said the West needs to take a startup mindset to weapons development and testing.
While not rejecting the primes, many European defense leaders have said they want a shakeup. Militaries across the continent are buying from smaller, newer companies as well as the big players.
The UK's armed forces minister, Luke Pollard, in May said that ""Ukraine's battlefield successes stems not just from great technology but also from their extraordinary ability to fail, learn, and iterate rapidly.""
Pål Jonson, the defense minister of Sweden, a NATO member and Ukraine ally, told Business Insider in February he was inspired by the Defense Innovation Unit in Silicon Valley, which helps companies and the US Department of Defense work together to field new technology at scale.
He said that using Silicon Valley as inspiration helped Sweden develop swarm drone technology in less than a year — a project that, he said, traditionally could have taken five years.
CSIS's McGinn said defense officials should not see startups as a silver bullet to their procurement issues. Relying on a mix of both startups and traditional defense firms will better ""contribute to the Army's success,"" he added.
""This is not about choosing only Silicon Valley companies. We need all kinds of companies to help support the Army and other parts of the Department of War,"" McGinn said.

8,2025-10-18,"With iPhone Air, Apple reintroduced the MagSafe battery pack. It’s $99, and optimized specifically for iPhone Air. It’s rather slim, though it’s rather weak in capacity – making Qi2 alternatives all the more interesting. We’ll be delving into the top options on the market, just in case you want a MagSafe battery for your iPhone without spending $99, or aren’t buying the iPhone Air.
Since Apple opened up the MagSafe standard as Qi2 last year, third parties have been able to make MagSafe chargers with support for 15W of charging. Prior to that, third parties only offered 7.5W with the initial Qi standard.
Another interesting fact: Apple’s iPhone Air MagSafe battery only supports up to 12W of charging, despite the iPhone Air supporting up to 20W of charging with MagSafe. That actually means third-party options are stronger in the charging speed department. We’ll be delving into those.
First things first is the Anker Nano Power Bank. This one is the mid-range option on the list, but it comes first because I’ve had tons of hands on time with it and can speak with first-hand experience with how thin it is, as well as how premium it feels. The form factor is rather remarkable, and likely serves as the closest alternative to Apple’s MagSafe battery. Read my full review here.
It charges your devices at 15W thanks to Qi2, offers 5000mAh of capacity, and runs cooler than the competition. Normally $54.99, it’s available for just $45.99 with today’s sale. You can pick one up in black or white.
While I haven’t personally spent time with this battery bank, I have spent enough time with other Baseus products to know that this will likely be a good option. It’s the cheapest option on this list, coming in at just $22.99 currently. It’s similarly thin to the Anker one, while offering 5000mAh of capacity.
Main caveat here is the fact that this doesn’t support Qi2, so you’ll be limited to 7.5W of charging speed. That could be rather annoying if you’re trying to recharge your phone in a pinch, though you can also use a USB-C cable for 20W of wired charging if it truly comes down to it. It comes in four colors: Cosmic Black, Rose Pink, Natural Titanium, and Space Gray.
This UGREEN option isn’t as thin as the others, but it’s here for good reason. It offers 10000mAh of capacity, and it also supports Qi2.2. That enables it to recharge devices at up to 25W, and isn’t yet widely supported on the market. You’ll need an iPhone 16 or later to utilize Qi2.2.
If form factor isn’t your biggest concern, and you just want the most battery capacity in a MagSafe battery, this is the best choice. Just like all of the other options, it also supports 30W wired charging through the USB-C port, faster than others on the list – and it also has a built in USB-C cable if you need it.
This one is the most expensive option in the list, but it’s also the most capable. It’s available on Amazon for $69.99. There’s also a neat display that allows you to check its capacity.

										Featuring two built in cables, a built in display, multiple ports, a 25,000mAh capacity, and up to 100W of output - this is one of the best battery banks for recharging your entire Apple ecosystem on the go.									

										Despite a new version reportedly being around a corner, I still personally believe AirPods Pro 2 are a great deal. They're already equipped with USB-C, and continually gain new software features. With them consistently going on sale, it's a great purchase to make. Features like Adaptive Audio are incredible.									"

GE Aerospace (NYSE: GE) is set to announce its earnings on Tuesday, October 21, 2025. Historical data from the past five years indicates that GE stock has generally responded positively to its earnings announcements. The stock has experienced a positive one-day return in 60% of the cases following the announcement. The median positive movement has been 5.1%, with the highest single-day gain recorded at 8.3%.
For traders focused on events, while the actual results compared to market consensus and expectations will determine the immediate response, knowing these historical patterns can enhance trading probabilities.
There are two main strategies to apply this information:
The consensus forecast for the upcoming report anticipates earnings of $1.46 per share on revenues of $10.39 billion. This represents an expected increase from the same quarter last year, which had earnings of $1.15 per share on sales of $8.94 billion.
In terms of finance, GE Aerospace holds a current market capitalization of $319 billion. Over the past twelve months, the company generated $42 billion in revenue, showcasing strong profitability with $7.9 billion in operating profits and a net income of $7.8 billion.
That said, if you are looking for growth with less volatility than owning an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark, which includes a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes, achieving returns greater than 105% since its inception. Why is that? Collectively, the stocks within the HQ Portfolio delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; resulting in a more stable investment experience, as reflected by the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Some insights regarding the one-day (1D) post-earnings returns:
Further data for the observed 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns following earnings are compiled alongside the statistics in the table below.
A strategy that is relatively less risky (though not effective if the correlation is low) is to comprehend the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns following earnings, identify a pair with the highest correlation, and execute the appropriate trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D demonstrate the highest correlation, a trader may position themselves “long” for the next 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Here is some correlation data based on a 5-year and a 3-year (more recent) history. Please note that the correlation 1D_5D refers to the relationship between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns.
Investing in a single stock without thorough analysis can be perilous. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has surpassed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to yield robust returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly adjusted mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offered an adaptable way to capitalize on favorable market conditions while curtailing losses during market downturns, as outlined in RV Portfolio performance metrics."

The combination of a gold stock with a low price-earnings ratio is hard to resist for a certain type of value investor.  The precious metals sector this year is outperforming most high P/E tech and social media stocks. Many gold and silver stocks still look classically cheap -- with P/E’s that remain far below that of the market as a whole. 
The basic understanding of this phenonmenon among analysts is that interest rate cuts lead to inflation and gold is considered the inflation hedge of choice. Other factors such as the economic effects of tariffs also lead to precious metals investing. Beyond that, increased fear of world events benefits the sector.
Fortuna Mining:
Based in Vancouver, this gold and silver miner operates in its home country as well as in Peru, Argentina and West Africa. The market capitalization is $2.67 billion. The price earnings ratio is 16. The debt-to-equity ratio is .16. Earnings this year are up 77% and up over the past three years by 19%.
Fortuna’s price joined in the Friday metals sell-off and dropped 8.52%. This, after it had blasted up on Wednesday and Thursday to that new 52-week high near $9.75. The stock dropped below the red-dotted uptrend line that had connected the early August low with the September dip.
Despite the slide, the price remains above the uptrending 50-day moving average and well above the uptrending 200-day moving average. Note that Friday’s selling volume is diminished from the previous session.  
Harmony:
The South African mining company has a market cap of $12.46 billion. This year’s earnings are up 115%. The price-earnings ratio is 15.84. The debt-to-equity ratio is .04. Harmony pays a dividend of 3.46%. HSBC Securities in early October upgraded its opinion of the stock from “hold” to “buy.”
The price peaked on Thursday at just above $22 and spent Friday giving back about three days worth of gains - finishing the day down 8.86%. Nevertheless, it remains above uptrending 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The relative strength indicator (RSI, below the price chart) has dropped out of the “overbought” zone. 
Iamgold:
 
Market cap is $7.68 billion for this Toronto-based miner with operations in North America and West Africa. The price-earnings ratio is 9.66. Market cap is $7.68 billion. The debt-to-equity ratio is .35. Earnings are up 49% this year. The stock trades at 2.24 times its book value.
Friday’s slide of 8.74% comes the day after hitting a new high the day before at near 14.75. The red-dotted uptrend line that connects the early August dip with the October low remains intact. Despite the big sell-off, the stock continues to trade well above both the uptrending 50-day and 200-day moving averages. 
 
Newmont:
This is the gold miner with the biggest market cap: $99.71 billion. That factor results in Newmont receiving the most attention from Wall Street, whether it’s noticed by artificial intelligence programs or actual human beings. The price-earnings ratio is 16.30. The company offers investors a 1% dividend.
Down 7.63% on Friday, the stock remains above that red-dotted uptrend line connecting the mid-June drop with the August dip, the September dip and the earlier-in-October dip. The price trades above uptrending 50-day and 200-day moving averages, despite the sudden pre-weekend plunge.

12,2025-10-18,"Xiaomi's smartphone lineup can be a little confusing at times, and this year, it's more confusing than ever. For example, the company launched the Xiaomi 15T this September and then immediately took the wraps off of the Xiaomi 17 series. Even more confusing is the fact that while ""T"" series phones are often positioned as slightly lower-cost than its non-T variants, the Xiaomi 15T Pro has some features that weren't available on the Xiaomi 15 Ultra.
Of course, the devices are available in different markets, which clears up some of the confusion. At its so-called ""sub-flagship"" price-point, is the Xiaomi 15T Pro worth buying? Or should you go for something else? I put the phone to the test to find out.
The Xiaomi 15T Pro is yet another flat-edged smartphone that takes a lot of inspiration from the iPhone. That's not a bad thing. The phone looks refined and sleek, with color-matched materials on the frame and back. It doesn't have a unibody design, but it almost looks like it. The phone is available in a few different colors, including Mocha Gold, Black, and Grey. I have the Mocha Gold option and I really like the look of it. It has a matte aluminum frame with a matte fiberglass back, and it looks and feels premium.
On the back you'll find a large square camera module in the top left-hand corner which houses the three camera sensors. Everything else about the phone is more or less standard. There's a volume rocker and power button on the right edge and a USB-C port on the bottom. There's an optical fingerprint sensor built into the screen, and while it's perhaps not as high-tech as the ultrasonic sensors built into some of Xiaomi's other phones, it still worked quickly and accurately.
The phone is reasonably durable, too. The front glass is Gorilla Glass 7i, and the device has an IP68 rating, which means that it should survive accidental submersion in water. As a whole, the Xiaomi 15T Pro looks premium and offers a nice feel. It's comfortable to hold, too, thanks to the slightly rounded edges. And it has a great-feeling, precise haptic feedback system, which is always nice to see.
On the front of the phone, you'll find a 6.83-inch AMOLED display, with a 144Hz refresh rate and a 3,200-nit peak brightness. It offers a reasonably high resolution, sitting in at 1,280 x 2,772, resulting in a pixel density of 447 pixels per inch. As a whole, the screen looks excellent. It may not be as bright as the displays in some of Xiaomi's other recent phones, but it still looks very bright and I found it easy to see content both indoors and outdoors, even in direct sunlight.
The only downside to this screen is the fact that it's not an LTPO panel, which means it can't quite adjust its refresh rate as dynamically as some other devices. It can still change refresh rate based on the content on the screen, but instead of being able to ramp up or down anywhere between 1Hz and 144Hz, it can switch between 30Hz, 60Hz, and 120Hz modes. None of this impacts how the screen looks, thankfully, but it does impact how much energy the screen uses. Still, rest assured, you're getting a great-looking screen on the Xiaomi 15T Pro. It's bright and vibrant and feels nice and smooth.
Under the hood, the Xiaomi 15T Pro is powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 9400 Plus coupled with 12GB of RAM. It's not MediaTek's most powerful chip. For now, that title goes to the Dimensity 9500, but it's still a great performing processor that can handle everything you can throw at it in 2025.
The phone also has Xiaomi's so-called 3D Ice Loop cooling system, which is a vapor chamber system that's larger on this phone compared to previous-generation ones. That should help it perform better for longer. I still found that it could heat up during extended gaming sessions, but that's largely to be expected. And to be fair, I was certainly trying to push the phone to its limits. It still handled these gaming sessions perfectly well, and it never skipped or froze during multitasking either.
To be clear, the phone won't perform quite as well as a device with the Dimensity 9500, nor one with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. It also lags behind smartphones with the latest generation Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite. In terms of raw performance, it beats the Pixel 10 series, though, so expect it to perform somewhere in between the Pixel 10 and the Galaxy S25. While you may not really feel any lags in performance right now, as the phone ages, you may find that it starts to slow down sooner than an even better-performing phone would.
On the back of the Xiaomi 15T Pro, you'll find a triple camera system made up of a 50-megapixel main camera, a 50-megapixel periscope telephoto camera with 5x optical zoom, and a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera with a 120-degree field of view. Generally speaking, the images captured by the device looked stunning. In well-lit environments, images were bright and vibrant while remaining relatively accurate. Xiaomi is still working with Leica for the color science of its photos, and you can choose between a few different profiles. I mostly stuck to the default Leica Authentic profile.
With its 5x optical zoom, I found that the telephoto camera produced excellent results too. Sometimes, telephoto cameras that zoom this far can result in a gap between the main camera and telephoto camera where you can see how digital zoom is used at 4x or so. Thankfully, images zoomed at 4x still looked quite good, even though they of course did use digital zoom. I did find that the camera was a little inconsistent when it came to colors — images taken with the telephoto camera looked a little different than those taken with the main camera.
The phone lets you zoom at up to 100x and uses generative AI to add more detail to images taken past 20x. I found that it did a pretty good job at delivering a final image that stayed true to what was in the actual scene. Though, of course, at the maximum 100x zoom, things do look a little funky.
The ultrawide camera is pretty good, too, though perhaps not quite as impressive as the main and telephoto cameras. I'm still able to capture pretty vibrant shots most of the time, and I was still able to capture as much detail in low light. That, of course, is a pretty niche situation, and the main and telephoto cameras still did a good job when it came to low-light photography. As a whole, the camera system built into the phone is excellent.
The Xiaomi 15T Pro is powered by a 5,500mAh battery, and I found that it was able to get me through a full day of even heavier use. But if you're expecting a multi-day battery, you may be disappointed. Again, the battery is perfectly fine, and if you remember to charge up either overnight or at some point during the day, you probably won't have any issues with it. It's just not as long lasting as some of the phones with larger batteries.
The device supports 90W wired charging, which is very fast, and that means that you should be able to fully charge in around 36 minutes. It also supports 50W wireless charging with a Xiaomi HyperCharge wireless charger, but it can also work with a Qi wireless charger.
As usual, one of the biggest things holding the phone back is its software experience, but it's not terrible. The phone runs Xiaomi's HyperOS 2, running on Android 15. Like other Xiaomi phones, you'll get things like a separate control center and notifications shade, and you can choose between having an app drawer or all your apps on home screens. It's obviously a stylized look, and you'll have to decide for yourself if you like it or not.
What you probably won't like is the amount of bloatware on the device. You'll get a range of additional apps pre-installed out of the box, including things like AliExpress, Amazon Music, TikTok, and LinkedIn. There are also duplicate apps, like Google's Files app and Xiaomi's File Manager. Some of these can be deleted — like LinkedIn -– but others can only be hidden from your home screen. Still, the software generally looks and feels perfectly fine. There's a lot going on, but it still felt relatively responsive, which is always helpful.
The Xiaomi 15T Pro has a lot going for it. With a sleek design, a great camera, and solid performance, there's really nothing bad about it. Sure, it doesn't quite compete with more expensive devices -– but it also shouldn't have to. At around 800 euros, there are other alternatives, but rest assured the Xiaomi 15T Pro is an excellent phone overall.
The competition to the Xiaomi 15T Pro largely varies depending on your region. This phone is mostly built for Europe, and in Europe, it competes with the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE, which I would argue has better software. It's also worth considering the Realme GT7 Pro, which will perform better than the Xiaomi 15T Pro. That said, if you're looking for a great camera, solid performance, and sleek design, the Xiaomi 15T Pro may be the phone for you.
Yes. It's a great phone at a good price."

RTX (NYSE: RTX) is scheduled to announce its earnings on Tuesday, October 21, 2025. Traditionally, RTX stock has exhibited a pattern of a negative one-day return in the aftermath of its earnings announcements. Throughout the last five years, the stock has decreased on 55% of the days immediately succeeding an earnings release. These negative returns have an average value of -1.6%, with a maximum one-day drop recorded at -10.2%.
For traders focused on events, recognizing these historical trends can serve as a significant advantage, although the immediate stock response is greatly influenced by how the actual outcomes line up with market expectations and consensus.
There are two main strategies to capitalize on this information:
The market consensus predicts RTX will reveal earnings of $1.41 per share with sales totaling $21.32 billion. This stands in contrast to the results from the same quarter last year, which reported earnings of $1.45 per share on sales of $20.09 billion.
Financially, the company holds a current market capitalization of $211 billion. In the past twelve months, RTX generated $84 billion in revenue, reporting $8.3 billion in operating profits and a net income of $6.1 billion.
However, if you are looking for potential upside with reduced volatility compared to holding individual stocks, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has significantly outperformed its benchmark—a composite of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indices—and has generated returns exceeding 105% since its inception. What is the reason for this? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; it is a smoother ride, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Additional data for recorded 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns after earnings are summarized along with the statistics in the table below.
A relatively lower-risk strategy (although not effective if the correlation is low) involves examining the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns post earnings, identifying a pair that demonstrates the highest correlation, and executing the appropriate trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D exhibit the highest correlation, a trader could position themselves as “long” for the next 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is favorable. Here is some correlation data based on a 5-year and a 3-year (more recent) history. Note that correlation 1D_5D refers to the correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and the subsequent 5D returns.
Investing in a single stock without thorough analysis can be perilous. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stock benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to deliver robust returns for investors. Why is that?

3M (NYSE: MMM) is set to release its earnings on Tuesday, October 21, 2025. This report holds significant importance for traders, especially those who utilize event-driven strategies.
In the past five years, 3M’s stock has shown a balanced response to earnings announcements, with an even division of positive and negative one-day returns after the results. In 50% of cases, the stock recorded a positive one-day return, averaging 4.8%. On the other hand, in the remaining 50% of cases, it faced a negative one-day return with an average of -2.8%. This historical trend indicates a considerable level of volatility and an absence of a consistent upward or downward trend following earnings.
For the upcoming third quarter of 2025, consensus predictions expect earnings of $2.07 per share on revenue of $6.26 billion. This contrasts with the earnings per share of $2.14 from the same quarter last year, even though current sales are projected to surpass the previous year’s $6.07 billion.
While the actual financial results and their comparison to consensus and expectations will significantly shape the stock’s immediate response, grasping these historical patterns can offer crucial insights for event-driven traders. There are two main strategies to contemplate:
From a fundamental standpoint, 3M currently possesses a market capitalization of around $81 billion. Over the past twelve months, the company generated $25 billion in revenue. It exhibited operational profitability with $4.8 billion in operating profits and a net income of $3.9 billion.
That said, if you are seeking an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has significantly outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster experience, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

A few observations regarding one-day (1D) post-earnings returns:
Additional information for observed 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns following earnings are presented along with the statistics in the table below.
A relatively less risky approach (though not effective if the correlation is weak) is to comprehend the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns after earnings, identify a pair that displays the highest correlation, and perform the suitable trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D exhibit the strongest correlation, a trader can position themselves “long” for the following 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Below is some correlation data derived from a 5-year and a 3-year (more recent) history. Note that the correlation 1D_5D relates to the correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns.
Investing in a single stock without thorough analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to deliver robust returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided an adaptive way to make the most of improving market conditions while minimizing losses during downturns, as elaborated in RV Portfolio performance metrics."

Philip Morris International (NYSE: PM) is set to release its earnings report on Tuesday, October 21, 2025. Evaluating the previous five years of data, Philip Morris stock has shown positive one-day returns after earnings announcements in 55% of cases. The median positive return recorded was 2.5%, with the highest one-day positive return hitting 10.9%.
For event-driven traders, while the actual outcomes compared to consensus and expectations are crucial, recognizing these historical trends can offer a strategic edge. Two main strategies can be utilized:
Analysts expect Philip Morris to announce earnings of $2.10 per share along with sales of $10.66 billion. These projections exceed the results from the same quarter last year, which reported earnings of $1.91 per share on sales of $9.91 billion.
From a fundamental perspective, the company currently has a market capitalization of $243 billion. Throughout the last twelve months, Philip Morris generated $39 billion in revenue, attaining $14 billion in operating profits and a net income of $8.2 billion.
That being said, if you are looking for potential gains with reduced volatility compared to holding an individual stock, you might consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its launch. Why is this the case? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; providing a smoother ride, as highlighted in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) is expected to release its earnings on Tuesday, October 21, 2025. Analyzing data from the past five years, Coca-Cola stock has shown a pattern of positive one-day returns following earnings announcements, occurring 67% of the time. The median positive return noted was 1.3%, with a maximum one-day positive return of 4.7%.
For traders who focus on events, while the actual results against consensus and expectations are essential, recognizing these historical trends can provide a strategic edge. There are two main strategies to take into account:
Analysts anticipate Coca-Cola to report earnings of $0.78 per share with sales reaching $12.41 billion. This compares to last year’s quarter's earnings of $0.77 per share on sales of $11.95 billion.
From a fundamental viewpoint, the company currently has a market capitalization of $291 billion. Over the past twelve months, Coca-Cola generated $47 billion in revenue, reporting $14 billion in operating profits and a net income of $12 billion.
That said, if you are looking for potential gains with lower volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns greater than 105% since its inception. Why is this the case?

    Commentary: Realme collaborated with Warner Bros. Discovery to launch the limited-edition phone. It's artistic, innovative and exciting all at once.
  
Game of Thrones was a cultural phenomenon in its prime, and it still seems to generate plenty of interest. That's why, six years after the show ended, Chinese phone-maker Realme has collaborated with Warner Bros. Discovery to give us a phone that appears to have come straight out of Westeros. Instead of just adding a theme to the UI or a couple of design changes, the two companies have transformed a midrange smartphone into a unique collector's piece.
Unlike modern smartphones, the Realme 15 Pro Game of Thrones Limited Edition screams premium (and royal) from its packaging. It's filled with Easter eggs from the show. You get a walnut wood-textured gift box with metallic edges, which features eye-catching design elements like the sigils of all nine houses of Westeros and a GOT metal nameplate.
I was already amazed with the packaging, but wasn't ready for what was to come.
Opening the box reveals a stunning 3D Iron Throne, designed to hold the phone. Once you look past that over-the-top craftsmanship, you're led to an inlaid map of Westeros with introductions to Houses Stark and Targaryen. It evokes the grandeur and drama that GOT fans would expect.
Lifting the right side of this flatly laid box reveals the phone, while the left side houses customized accessories and more Easter eggs, including a UV-treated letter whose text is only visible when exposed to sunlight. And that's not even the best part.
The SIM-ejector tool is my favorite. It's styled to look like the pin worn by the King's Hand.
My favorite is the customized SIM-ejector tool, which is inspired by Tyrion Lannister and styled to look like the King's Hand pin. Other phone accessories include a case, an 80-watt charger and a USB-A to USB-C cable. Plus, there are a few stickers and four postcards with portraits of Daenerys Targaryen, Jon Snow, Arya Stark and Tyrion Lannister.
The Realme 15 Pro Game of Thrones Limited Edition features some striking visual elements. It has Westeros house sigils engraved under the glass housing of the now-extended camera module, with dragon claws digging into the two bottom corners.
Each camera lens sports a gold accent ring with different engravings. The main lens is engraved with House Stark's iconic ""Winter is Coming,"" while the chroma sensor ring below features House Lannister's ""Hear Me Roar."" Moving toward the bottom of the camera module, you'll find another elegant ""Fire and Blood"" engraving. 
Too much text can sometimes lessen the charm of a design, but not on this phone. The black-and-gold themed camera island has so many details and, surprisingly, none of them grabs attention from the other.
The Realme 15 Pro Game of Thrones Limited Edition also features a 3D-engraved House Targaryen sigil on its lower back. Its gold accent offers a stunning contrast to the rest of the back's black color, and is only accentuated by the matte finish on the gold side frame. Every time I pick this phone up, I pause and look at it for a bit. You can admire this design all day long.
As if that wasn't enough, Realme made a color-changing back panel. Its black leather transforms into a vivid red color when exposed to temperatures of 44 degrees Celsius (111 degrees Fahrenheit) or higher. As it cools, the panel returns to its original black. It's super cool to see the color-changing effect in action. The phone is IP68 and IP69 rated, so you don't need to worry about water getting through.
This immersive experience continues as you switch on and set up the phone. Realme's GOT-themed design language extends to its UI, including a Targaryen house sigil on the fingerprint unlock, two unique camera filters (Northland and Kingdom), custom icons and Light and Fire-themed live wallpapers.
As for the specifications, it's identical to the regular Realme 15 Pro. So, you get a 6.8-inch AMOLED screen with support for a 144Hz refresh rate. It's easily legible outdoors.
The new Realme phone is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 chipset, paired with 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. It packs a 7,000 mAh battery with support for 80-watt fast charging, which is rated to charge the phone from 20% to 100% within an hour. 
Despite the big battery and screen size, this special edition Realme phone weighs under 200 grams. It might not seem like a huge deal on paper, but it's one of the most comfortable-to-use big phones, in my experience. It's also slimmer than many mainstream flagship phones. For context, it measures 7.84mm, which is less than the iPhone 17 (7.95mm) and Google Pixel 10 (8.6mm). Doing this with a hint of luxury makes it an excellent value proposition.
The Realme 15 Pro Game of Thrones Limited Edition is a spectacular mix of artistry, innovation, drama and grandeur. It sports the right amount of extravagance and practicality to be a collector's item as well as a day-to-day phone.
Realme is only making 5,000 units of this special-edition device, and it's now available to purchase in India, though it's currently out of stock. The Realme 15 Pro Game of Thrones Limited Edition doesn't get a huge price bump over the regular model. It remains attainable at 44,999 rupees (approximately $510), which is a great price when you account for all the unique extras. "

The laptop market is drowning in hundreds of models, each claiming to be the perfect fit and honestly, it’s exhausting trying to figure out which one actually delivers daily performance without unnecessary extras. If you need a powerful machine that handles real work without drama, this Dell Inspiron 15.6-inch touchscreen laptop (16GB RAM, 1.25TB Storage) checks every box, especially at its current price: Dell rarely drops discounts below 30 percent on its own site, but Amazon just slashed this model to an all-time low of $699, down from $1,999. That’s a 65 percent reduction on a laptop built for people who actually use their computers for more than checking email.

The 13th Gen Intel Core i5-1334U processor is where this notebook diverges from budget laptops. This is the 10-core processor with hybrid architecture: two performance cores that operate between 1.3GHz and 4.6GHz to handle intensive jobsÂ and eight efficiency cores that work between 0.9GHz and 3.4GHz to handle background processes.
The 12MB cache memory keeps often-used data on hand for quick grab and go, and eliminates the time your processor spends searching through RAM. Practically speaking, it means you can be on video conference calls and working on spreadsheet edits, churning out presentations and keeping hundreds of browser tabs open without the system grinding to an unresponsive crawl.
The 16GB DDR4 RAM provides you the working memory you need to handle heavy multitasking. RAM is where programs youre currently running live, and more room means more smooth-as-silk performance when youre running several programs. Storage is provided by the lightning-fast 1TB M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD. PCIe NVMe SSDs are the fastest consumer storage tech available and cut boot times and file copies by orders of magnitude over old hard drives or earlier SATA SSDs. The system comes with an included second 256GB SD card to boost overall storage to 1.25TB to accommodate massive media libraries.
The 15.6-inch FHD touchscreen uses WVA panel technology. This ensures colors stay consistent when viewed from the side whcih is crucial during collaborative work sessions. The 1920 x 1080 resolution delivers sharp text and detailed images while the anti-glare coating reduces eye strain during long work sessions and makes the screen readable in bright environments. The narrow border design maximizes screen real estate without increasing the laptop’s footprint, keeping it portable while maintaining a comfortable viewing area. Intel Iris Xe Graphics handles visual processing and offers smooth performance for video playback.
The Realtek Wi-Fi 6 card has faster speeds and better performance in busy networks compared to Wi-Fi 5, which is essential for video conferencing and cloud office collaboration. Bluetooth accommodates wireless mice, headphones, and keyboard. Port options are USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A and Type-C to transfer data quickly, USB 2.0 to connect to previous accessories, HDMI 1.4 to connect an external monitor, headset jack, and SD card slot. The bundled 8-in-1 docking station accommodates more connectivity with additional USB ports and SD slots and an RJ-45 ethernet connector to remain connected by wire and output the HDMI signal to an external monitor.
Windows 11 Professional is available in S Mode to limit installations to Microsoft Store applications for increased security. S Mode can be switched off permanently if traditional desktop applications are required. The keyboard is full size and has the familiar 10-key numerical keypad to handle spreadsheet work and data entry.
With these specifications at $699, you get hardware worth $1500 to $2,000 even on sale.

Is an AI-generated video of a politician technically a deepfake if the words theyâre saying are their own?
By any reasonable definition, yes, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee published just such a deepfake of Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on its X account on Friday:
Week 3 of the Schumer Shutdown:
""Every day gets better for us."" pic.twitter.com/1qeNKhvcfI
— Senate Republicans (@NRSC) October 17, 2025

The ad, which is labeled as AI-generated, depicts Schumer saying six words he did actually say: âEvery day gets better for us,â but the quote originally comes from a text interview with Schumer published in Punchbowl News. After saying these words in the video, Schumerâs digital mouth peels into a nightmare grin like Jim Carrey in The Grinch.
âThese are Chuck Schumerâs own words,â NRSC communications director Joanna Rodriguez told The Associated Press, adding that âvideo is a way for voters to see and hear it themselves.â Reading the quote aloud in a scary voice and putting it onscreen in red text is a more traditional way of doing this in political ads.
The video is vaguely cinematic, with heavy bokeh. Savvy internet content consumers probably would not mistake this for an off-the-cuff-remark taken from a TV news clip, or a smartphone video taken by a congressional reporter. It looks more like a stock photo of Schumer hastily animated with a quick-and-dirty online tool like Googleâs Veo 3.
Thatâs not to say thereâs nothing to worry about. According to a famous genre of viral video, Facebook users in their 60s and older fall for much less plausible AI trickery all the time.
The X rules state âYou may not deceptively share synthetic or manipulated media that are likely to cause harm.â The âlikely to cause harmâ phrasing leaves room for interpretation, particularly since the video has only received 364 reposts and 414 likes on X at the time this was published.
In the original interview, Schumer is essentially saying his partyâs messaging around the government shutdownâan attempt to focus the publicâs attention on healthcareâis going well. He even reiterates this in slightly longer form: âBut every day weâre getting better and better as the message sinks in more and more deeply.â
We reached out to Senator Schumer for comment, and will update if we hear back.

The wait might be finally over as Samsung is set to host another virtual Galaxy event to unveil its new AI-focused devices as well as Android's XR platform.
In a press release to Android Central, Samsung said that users should prepare for the Galaxy event ""Worlds Wide Open."" This event is set to take place next week on October 21 at 10 pm ET (7 pm PT). It will be streamed on Samsung's main site, as well as its YouTube channel. At the heart of the matter, we have what the company is preparing to talk about: Project Moohan, otherwise known as Samsung's first XR headset.
Samsung says that Project Moohan will ""blend everyday utility with immersive new experiences, unlocking a whole new dimension of possibility and setting a new benchmark for XR.""

Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold was caught under a heavy dark cloud this week, or a white cloud (pun intended). Zack Nelson, the host of the 'JerryRigEverything' channel on YouTube, put the Pixel 10 Pro Fold through his infamous durability test. And things got pretty ugly, with Google's latest Fold pretty much exploding and smoking during the bend test.
Here's what happened: the first time he bent the device in reverse, it pretty much snapped in half at the antenna lines on top. However, when he tried to bend the device further, the battery almost instantly gave out and began smoking.
According to Android Central's Jerry Hildenbrand, this was caused by something called the thermal runaway. It occurs when something causes a spot in the battery to heat up, such as the excessive pressure from the bend test. Which created ""a self-sustaining chain reaction that heats adjacent spots until everything becomes hot enough to burn.""

The word on the street is that Samsung has reportedly cancelled its Edge variant, as its predecessor didn't fare well in the market. According to recent reports, people weren't as interested in buying the ultra-slim Galaxy S25 Edge due to several underlying reasons. While we don't know for sure what caused it, we assume that its hefty price tag and the battery capacity could've pushed for this to happen.
This has led Samsung to reportedly cut production and offer heavy discounts on the device. Which means we won't be seeing it in the Galaxy S26 lineup, as a Samsung executive said that the slim Edge line is unlikely to return. This means that there may not be a line-up reshuffle after all, and that Samsung could be sticking to its usual base, Plus, and Ultra trio.

Android 16's next beta just about landed before it was pulled from the servers due to a boot loop issue. But here's what users can expect to see when the stable version drops.
The beta version supposedly makes it easier to add app shortcuts directly to the home screen. While this isn't a new feature, Google has just made it easier to create a shortcut with a ""+"" button beside each shortcut, making it more obvious that they can be pinned to the home screen.
Some smaller tweaks include a Live Caption shortcut that has been added directly to the volume control menu, and the icons for the microphone, Google Lens, and AI Mode in the home screen search bar are now slightly larger for better visibility.
Those are some of the biggest stories from this week. Meanwhile, here are some other stories that are worth catching up on:

31,2025-10-18,"Owning property is extremely expensive these days. Basically unattainable to many Americans. Some buy homes with the hope of flipping it and selling it for much more than they paid. The only problem with this technique, however, is that many of these flippers have no professional idea what they are doing.
 
So if you're on the market for a home, (lucky!) it's important to also hire a good home inspector. Sure you can spot a hole in the wall or a puddle on the basement floor. But home inspectors find all the violations that will actually end up costing you more if you do end up buying the house. Take Inspector Noah, a house inspector who posts some of this craziest inspections on his TikTok. One that he recently posted was showing a $370k home that was renovated by the realtor who was also listing the house. Feels like a conflict of interest, but whatever… Good thing he was able to go through it, because that $370k house would've quickly turned into costing someone something closer to over half a million!

When you buy a home, it's important to get it inspected first, because the violations the inspector finds will cost you to fix. So you can either negotiate down in price to compensate for those repairs or have the homeowner repair those violations before selling so it doesn't cost you more to fix them. If not, like this house, you might be thinking you're getting a good deal, but really you're getting swindled. 
 
Like this house that had countless violations and even fake wood floors installed ON TOP OF CARPET. Like, who does that??

32,2025-10-18,"For a certain generation, there is nothing quite like the DVD era, which exploded in the early 2000s. Gone were the days of ""be kind, rewind"" when VHS ruled the world. Instead, movies could be viewed at home with ease and in crystal clear quality not seen before on the home media market. It was a big deal. For younger folks out there who have largely grown up in the streaming era, this might sound meaningless. That goes double for the notion of a DVD screensaver.
Again, for those who owned a DVD player in the 2000s, there was nothing quite like the simple appeal of a DVD screensaver. ""The Office"" even had a famous intro gag all about it in season 5, with the show's characters watching the DVD logo hoping it will go exactly into the corner of a TV screen while their boss Michael Scott (Steve Carell) is holding a meeting. Be it in a classroom or just because one left the DVD player on at home after watching a movie, these screensavers were a part of cinema at this time, oddly enough.
It's something that Google has since decided to immortalize with a hidden Easter egg within the popular search engine. Google regularly does things like this, having even included a pretty brutal Thanos tie-in around the time ""Avengers: Endgame"" hit theaters. For those looking for a little blast from the past, here's how to access Google's DVD screensaver Easter egg.
Those who wish to see Google's DVD screensaver Easter egg for themselves can follow a series of very simple steps to get there. First, head over to the Google.com homepage, then type ""DVD screensaver"" into the search bar. And that's pretty much it!
After these steps are taken, the Google logo will move away from its usual location at the top lefthand side of the screen and begin bouncing all over the screen, not unlike the DVD logo on DVD players from years past. The logo will also change color, which is something that these DVD player menu animations also did when they were left to do their thing. It's a pretty accurate little blast from the past and a reminder of the good ol' days when it comes to DVDs, which began roughly around 1997 when ""Twister"" became one of the first movies ever released on DVD.
One important note for anyone looking to chase down this bit of early 2000s nostalgia: The Easter egg in question only works on desktop devices. It won't work on mobile devices, meaning if you try it on your phone or tablet, it's going to be a disappointing experience. But next time you're on your laptop or desktop computer, feel free to give it a go.
For anyone seeking a little more old school DVD action, a visit to BouncingDVDLogo.com might do the trick. Not to spoil the surprise, but it pretty much does exactly what the URL promises. Enjoy.
This whole notion of a DVD screensaver menu really is a throwback to a different time. Now, when we turn on our smart TVs, it's usually a screen populated with endless tiles for various streaming services, representing bottomless pits of viewing options. In some ways better and in some ways worse, the era of seeing these DVD screensavers was a simpler time.
What's interesting is that these DVD screensavers actually had a function purpose when they were created. As the Hacker News forum once pointed out, ""The bouncing logo wasn't just for fun, but was important to prevent screen burn-in on CRTs. If you had a static image on a CRT for a long time, it could damage the phosphor. Sometimes you could even see the image when the screen was off!""
These days, the DVD market isn't what it once was, even though it's far from dead. Streaming dominates viewership, but the advent of Blu-ray and 4K Ultra HD discs has managed to capitalize on the collector's market thanks to viewers who not only want to preserve their favorites but also watch them in the highest quality possible when they please. As a result, classics are regularly remastered in 4K these days to entice the small but loyal patrons of the physical media market to open up their wallets.
The heyday of DVDs is very far in the rearview mirror, though. Not only are these DVD screensavers largely a thing of the past, but even the robust bonus features that once made home media in general worth it are disappearing rapidly. In that way, this Google Easter egg is truly a reminder of a better time for many hardcore movie and TV fans out there."

    If you want to declutter your kitchen, start by getting rid of these unnecessary tools.
  
Let's be honest, you bought at least five of these gimmicky tools. It's time to let them go 
Let's be honest: your kitchen drawers are a graveyard for ""life-changing"" gadgets you bought to make cooking easier, but now they just sit there collecting dust. All those special slicers and holders aren't making you a better cook; they're just taking up space.
So, how do you know what's actually worth keeping? I asked professional chefs, and they all had the same advice: stick to the basics. You don't need a drawer full of single-task gimmicks. A great knife, a sturdy cutting board, and one reliable pan can do it all. It's time to master the real tools and ditch the junk.
To separate the essential from the superfluous or downright useless, we asked culinary pros to share the tools they swear by and the gadgets they'd skip. Their advice will help you avoid falling for flashy products and instead invest in items that you'll reach for every single day. When decluttering your kitchen, you'll have to make some tough decisions but we're here to help.

Celebrity chef, restaurateur
Masaharu Morimoto shared his pick for the most overrated kitchen tool.
Chef Morimoto encourages beefing up your knife skills to make thin and uniform vegetable slices.
Why: ""While it brings good slices, mastering proper knife skills gives you more control, precision and safety in the long run. Mandolins can be bulky, hard to clean and risky if you're not extremely careful. Relying too much on a mandolin or tools like a two-in-one apple cutter or a tomato corer can hold you back from developing real technique. Taking the time to learn how to handle a sharp chef's knife or Japanese blade will help you in almost every recipe."" 
What to try instead: Mac 8-inch Japanese chef knife.
Lead chef-instructor Institute of Culinary Education, Los Angeles
Culinary instructor Eric Rowse knows a gimmicky kitchen tool when he sees one.
Why: ""These look like a weapon for Wolverine wannabes; it's meant to help you hold a whole onion and ""chop"" it. Instead, cut the onion in half to create a flat surface so it won't roll away. If you're trying to cut rings, save the $14 and stick a fork in the root and hold the fork.""
What to try instead: Learn to properly slice an onion the old-fashioned way.
Save your money -- and some dignity -- and skip the onion goggles.
Why: ""A waste of money as they don't form a great seal around the eyes to prevent the sulfur compounds from getting to your eyes and making you cry. Keep your knife sharp and open a window or turn on a fan instead.""
What to try instead: CNET's Peter Butler shares tips for cutting onions without crying.
Glass, stone and metal boards are OK for serving but when slicing and dicing, wood is the way to go.
Why: ""Cutting on hard surfaces is bad for your knives; instead, go for wood or poly.""
What to try instead: Our list of the best cutting boards features plenty of knife-safe options. 
Two forks are all you need to successfully shred chicken.
Why: ""I can't think of anyone needing a tool devoted to shredding chicken outside a restaurant and even restaurants don't use it. This item only has one purpose so I'd skip it.""
What to try instead: Two forks.
Why: ""I love thyme but hate stripping it. When I was young I got suckered into believing this tool would help me … It's been sitting in my cupboard, laughing at me for almost a decade now.""
What to try instead: For heartier herbs like rosemary and thyme, just use your fingers to slide down the stem, opposite to how the leaves grow.
Instant read meat probes work fast and don't require a fussy Bluetooth connection.
Why: ""These are a great tool but can be very expensive. I can see myself losing, breaking, dropping, accidentally throwing away or dropping it in the coals.""
What to try instead: ThermoPro's Lightning Instant Read Thermometer
Cookbook author and lifestyle expert
Cookbook author Peter Som didn't hold back when asked about his least favorite kitchen tools.
A manual can opener is cheaper, works great and is less likely to break.
Why: ""Most of us grew up with an electric can opener permanently stationed on the kitchen counter, like it was a vital appliance. But truthfully, they're more nostalgia than necessity. They take up space, can be a hassle to clean and often struggle with irregularly sized cans. A good manual opener is compact, reliable and gets the job done without needing an outlet or a user manual.""
What to try instead: Oxo's soft-handled can opener.
Personal chef to Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union and author of Love: My Love Expressed Through Food
Richard Ingraham avoids certain kitchen tools when cooking for celebs like Dwayne Wade and Gabrielle Union.
Why: ""A knife and spoon do the job just as easily and the specialized tool rarely fits all avocado sizes properly. It's a one-trick pony that clutters drawers.""
What to try instead: A good paring knife like this $35 Wusthof
Separating an egg by hand isn't so difficult that it requires hardware.
Why: ""A tool just for separating yolks is unnecessary for most home cooks."" The only exception may be this one, and even that is just for yolks. Err, I mean yucks.
What to try instead: Cracking an egg and using the shell halves or your fingers works just as well. 
Why: ""Rolling garlic cloves in a silicone tube may work but requires storing a single-purpose gadget.""
What to try instead: Smashing garlic cloves with a chef knife is quicker and more reliable.
Chef Ingraham says skip the scissors on pizza night.
Why: ""A pizza cutter or knife works better and faster. These scissors are gimmicky, awkward to clean and take up more space than they're worth.""
What to try instead: KitchenAid's stainless-steel pizza wheel. 
Why: ""They're hard to clean and don't offer a huge advantage over a sharp chef's knife. Plus, they tend to crush delicate herbs more than slice them.""
What to try instead: Made In's 8-inch Chef Knife.
Why: ""Boiling eggs in a pot is straightforward and flexible. The electric version just adds clutter unless you boil eggs constantly and hate using a stove.""
What to try instead: This 1-minute hack for making poached eggs in the microwave.
A good butter knife works just as well and requires less space and maintenance. 
Why: ""It slices sticks of butter into pats … but why? A knife works instantly and you don't have to load and clean a plastic gadget for it.""
What to try instead: Williams Sonoma breakfast butter blade.
Why: ""It's a plastic disc with holes to tell you how much spaghetti to cook. Just eyeball it or learn the rough weight by experience. It's not worth the drawer space.""
What to try instead: A kitchen scale for precise measurements.
Why: ""Often clogs, sprays unevenly and requires constant cleaning. A small spoon or brush does the job with less frustration.""
What to try instead: World Market's olive oil cruet.
A sharp vegetable peeler is all you need to skin a batch of potatoes.
Why: ""Takes up a surprising amount of space and peels slower than a regular peeler. Plus, it's overkill unless you're peeling dozens of potatoes at once.""
What to try instead: Oxo's Swivel peeler.
Why: ""Sold as a safer way to slice bagels but takes up a ton of space and is awkward to clean. A serrated knife does the job just fine.""
What to try instead: Opinel's 8-inch bread knife. 
Executive chef, Kellogg's Diner
Jackie Carnesi
There's a reason pro chefs don't use oven mitts.
Why: ""Oven mitts are the most useless item in a home kitchen. A sturdy kitchen towel does the same job, and odds are, it's more likely to be washed regularly. I don't know many people who wash their oven mitts frequently enough ... it seems many have deemed it an item that doesn't warrant regular cleaning. It does.""
What to try instead: Stock a plethora of kitchen towels."

36,2025-10-18,"A diabetic child from Chennai was rushed to the ICU, severely dehydrated. His parents had done everything right — or so they thought. They had given him a tetra-pack “ORS” drink after he began vomitting and passing loose stool. By the time he reached the hospital, his condition had spiralled into an emergency.
In another part of the country, a young girl recovering from burn injuries suddenly became critical because of dehydration. Her caregivers, too, had been faithfully administering a store-bought “ORS” product.
The common thread in both stories? Packaged, flavoured drinks that claim to be “ORS solutions”.
For years, the Hyderabad-based paediatrician, Dr Sivaranjini Santhosh, has been collecting stories like these — heartbreaking accounts from parents, colleagues and anxious relatives who reach out to her through her social media platforms. Her aim has been to ensure that children with diarrhoea do not end up consuming flavoured, sweetened beverages in place of the genuine Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS), a landmark discovery in medicine pioneered by Dr Dilip Mahalanabis.
On Wednesday, the country’s food regulator issued an order banning all beverages from using the term ORS in their trademarked name, withdrawing an earlier order allowing the term with disclaimers. “Over the last decade or so, several tetra-pack products claiming to be ORS have entered the market without actually adhering to the sugar and salt ratios needed for a person to effectively absorb the water they are drinking,” Dr Santhosh told The Indian Express.
A CRUSADE THAT BEGAN EIGHT YEARS AGO
Her journey started with educating people on social media around eight years ago — she saw children coming to her clinics who were severely dehydrated despite being given what the parents assumed was an ORS solution.
But she knew that was not enough. These products were not only giving children excess sugar; they were actively harming their health. “Even if a product carries the warning ‘not ORS’ — which many of the new products do not — people still think that it is an ORS solution because that’s what the brand name suggests. It misleads people into choosing products that can actually worsen the diarrhoea in children and may even lead to deaths if timely medical intervention does not happen,” said Dr Santhosh.
“ORS is a medical product that has saved millions of lives. Around 13 per cent of the deaths in children under the age of five years happen because of diarrhoea and ORS is an effective tool for preventing these deaths. There is a fixed formula for how much glucose, sodium chloride and potassium chloride should be present in the ORS solution. This formula is such that the sugar and salt actually pull water with them into the body and rehydrate a person. Any excess sugar will actually pull the water back into the gut and worsen the diarrhoea,” she explained.
 
 
A post shared by Dr Sivaranjani Santosh (@drsivaranjanionline)
 
A LONG LEGAL BATTLE
In her eight-year long journey to ensure that people are not misled, she went to the Telangana High Court, wrote to the Union Health Minister and the Prime Minister. “I knew I had to stop this when I saw severely dehydrated children coming into my clinics, when my colleagues reported that children ended up in ICUs because they were given these tetra-pack solutions that did not really help.”
But there were several ups and downs. At first, she did not even know who she should reach out to. “Being a medical product, I assumed that the drug regulator (Central Drugs and Standards Control Organisation) would regulate these products. When they wrote back to me, I was surprised to find out that it was actually the food regulator.”
Dr Santhosh also wrote to medical associations to discontinue sponsorships from these products. “I was isolated, people would talk behind my back. Even my family at times thought whether it was worth it — these were big companies like Johnson and Johnson, Dr Reddy’s that I was taking on.” She also found out that the Indian Paediatric Association continued to have stalls of some of these drinks at their events.
A MATTER OF ETHICS
At one point, she considered giving up. But she knew she would not be able to live with herself. She said her college, JIPMER Puducherry, had taught her to be ethical and she knew she had to keep going.
Then came an April 2022 order where the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) restricted the use of the term ORS, but the relief did not last long. “Within months, there was another order that said that the companies could continue to use ORS in their names as long as they carried a warning stating that it was not an ORS solution. Even that order was not implemented properly. Newer products entered the market that did not carry the warning either,” said Dr Sathosh.
Her struggle came to fore earlier this month when she posted a video about the deaths of children in Madhya Pradesh after consuming tainted syrup. She asked a simple question — how could doctors alone ensure the safety of children when regulators kept allowing harmful products to enter the market. She asked how many children would have to die for the regulator to take action on the ORS solutions.
WHAT FSSAI SAID
And, finally, the FSSAI on Wednesday banned the use of ‘ORS’ in these beverage names.
“It is hereby clarified that, upon further review, the use of the term ‘ORS’ in the trademarked name or in the naming of any food product otherwise-whether fruit-based, non-carbonated, or ready-to-drink beverages-even when accompanied by a prefix or suffix, constitutes a violation of the provisions of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 and the regulations made thereunder,” the order said. This will come into effect immediately, meaning these products cannot be sold anymore.
“We have won,” said Dr Santhosh.

37,2025-10-18,"The 34-year-old has stopped providing snacks and baked goods for her office
Getty
 A 34-year-old woman stopped giving her coworkers baked goods after disapproving of the nickname they gave her.

 In a post on Reddit, the woman shared that she regularly brought homemade cookies or banana bread for the people in her office.

 “People seemed to appreciate it, until recently,” the woman shared. “Last week, a coworker joked that I was ‘the office mom.’ Everyone laughed, but I felt weird about it. Then another guy said, ‘You should bring snacks more often, Mom.' ""

Getty
 The woman told them, “You can call me (my name) not mom.” They laughed at her, and someone told her not to be so ""uptight.""

 The comment was the straw that broke the camel's back, so she ""stopped baking. Simple as that.""

 ""The next Monday, one of them asked, Where are the muffins? I said, 'Didn’t feel like being the office mom this week,'"" she recalled. ""It got quiet after that.""

 “Now I’m being told I’m ‘making things awkward’ and ‘overreacting.’ I didn’t yell or anything. I just stopped doing free labor that suddenly came with a nickname I didn’t like. Am I overreacting for pulling back?”

 People in the comments supported the woman for setting a boundary with her coworkers. 

 “No. Good for you. You didn't overreact,” one person commented. “You asked nicely for the nickname to be dropped, and they decided to ignore you and not care about your feelings. Baked goods are a treat, not a right, and certainly not for anyone by passing your feelings and calling you something you've said you don’t like.”

 Another person added in their own experience, writing, “makes all the sense in the world to me. But then I’ve also been the one bringing in baked goods. It is always interesting to me how amazingly rude people think that defending their inconsiderate actions by saying, ‘oh, come on. You are overreacting. Don’t be so uptight.’ As opposed to, ‘I apologize for being so rude,’ is going to convince the person they insulted to continue to be generous with them. They had their chance. No banana bread for them.”

Neon lights flicker, woks sizzle, and the aroma of grilled skewers fills the air. What began as a Southern California phenomenon inspired by the vibrant street markets of Asia is now poised to go national.
FoodieLand, America’s largest food festival producer, just got even bigger. The company has officially acquired 626 Night Market—the original and largest night market in the United States—uniting two cultural powerhouses that have shaped how the real foodies of America experience food, community, and creativity.
“FoodieLand was founded on the idea that food festivals can bring people together through culture, creativity, and shared experiences,” said Julie Christine, CEO of FoodieLand. “626 Night Market has always embodied that same spirit. It helped introduce the night market concept to America and inspired an entire generation of food lovers and entrepreneurs.”
Founded in 2019, FoodieLand has rapidly become the nation’s premier destination for culinary discovery and cultural celebration. Designed as a gathering place for friends and families, its immersive festivals bring together the best local chefs and global flavors, celebrating community through delicious food, live music, games, and unforgettable experiences.
With over 250 vendors, 1.6 million annual attendees, and events in 18+ cities nationwide, FoodieLand continues to redefine what large-scale food festivals can look like in America.
Julie said the acquisition is about growth with purpose. “Acquiring 626 Night Market is about carrying that legacy forward. We want to make sure it continues to grow while staying true to its roots,” she explained. “This partnership allows us to expand its reach, share its cultural story with more communities, and strengthen our long-term vision of connecting people across the country through food and culture.”
Meanwhile, 626 Night Market, founded in 2012 in Southern California, has become a landmark cultural event and the most recognized night market in the country. Hosting more than ten events annually across California and Nevada, it showcases hundreds of food vendors, small retail pop-ups, artists, entrepreneurs, and live performers.
Inspired by the bustling open-air markets of Asia—from the legendary street food stalls of Bangkok and Chiang Mai to Taipei’s Shilin and Seoul’s Gwangjang markets—626 Night Market helped pioneer the modern American night-market movement. Known for its colorful lights, sizzling skewers, bubble tea, and fusion dishes that draw hundreds of thousands of attendees each year, it celebrates the vibrant intersection of cuisine, creativity, and community that defines the Asian night market experience.
“626 Night Market has always represented the vibrant energy of Asian night markets, where culture, community, and creativity come together,” Julie said. “FoodieLand will preserve that authenticity by keeping its name and brand intact, working closely with local communities, and continuing to highlight the small business owners and creators who represent its cultural roots.”
While many acquisitions risk diluting what made an event special, FoodieLand insists the opposite will happen here. Julie emphasized, “Scaling nationally doesn’t change its identity; it allows more people to experience the culture and creativity that made it special.”
Both brands have long been launchpads for small businesses, chefs, and creators who rely on festival exposure to build loyal followings.
“Both FoodieLand and 626 Night Market have always been platforms for small businesses and emerging chefs to grow,” said Julie. “This acquisition strengthens that mission by giving independent vendors more visibility and access to larger audiences.”
Beyond the business deal, the move signals a broader shift in America’s relationship with global street-food culture.
“626 Night Market brought the energy and creativity of Asian night markets to America and inspired a new generation of food lovers and new businesses,” Julie noted.
“Over the next decade, we see this movement continue to grow and evolve by blending global flavors and local talents that bring the community together. FoodieLand’s role is to build on this foundation by supporting local businesses, celebrating diversity, and inspiring the next generations of food creators.”
That community-first approach extends to how FoodieLand curates its vendor lineup—a meticulous process balancing local flavor and innovation.
“We look for vendors who bring creativity, authenticity, and a real passion for what they do,” said Julie. “We want every event to reflect the community around it, so we curate a diverse mix of small businesses, local vendors, local talents, and emerging artists. Vendors who care about the guest experience and who put love into what they serve always stand out.”
To Julie, the magic of FoodieLand lies in storytelling through food.
“Definitely Famous Pudn! Their banana pudding is legendary. It’s artisanal and small-batch, and you can really taste the care and quality in every bite. Once you have a bite, you’ll understand why they’re popular,” she said.
“They served it with crispy fried chicken and the flavors were incredible. I also had the Honolulu Sushi Taco—they fry nori into a light, crispy taco shell, layer in warm rice, and fill it with marinated salmon and tuna. It’s such a creative twist on the classic taco and a perfect example of how our vendors serve original ideas to the community.”
Julie continued, “Another favorite of mine is Fallow Ground Matcha. They use over six grams of Japanese ceremonial matcha in each serving, and it’s our go-to way to start the day. We can’t go a day without that matcha foam. It’s one of those small rituals that’s become part of our festival routine.”
When it comes to vendor success, Julie says it’s not just about the food—it’s about the feeling.
“The vendors who stand out are the ones who create an experience around their food and bring something truly unique—dishes or concepts you won’t find at a county fair or a neighborhood restaurant,” she explains.
“They combine creativity, presentation, and personality in a way that draws people in. Success at our festivals isn’t just about serving great food. It’s about creating excitement and connection. The vendors who thrive are the ones who make guests feel part of something memorable, whether through a signature dish, a great story, or the energy they bring to their booth.”
And for loyal festival-goers, the team plans to keep things familiar but fresh.
“Our guests love seeing their favorite vendors, but they also come ready to discover something new,” said Julie. “We balance that by rotating vendors between locations and introducing new talent, dishes, and activations each season. Every event has its own mix of returning favorites and first-time participants, so guests always get a unique experience no matter how many times they visit.”
With this acquisition, FoodieLand isn’t just expanding its footprint—it’s expanding the definition of what an American food festival can be: a celebration of creativity, community, and cultural connection that continues to evolve with every bite."

Google just quietly killed something you may never have used or heard of: Privacy Sandbox. You should grieve this death anyway, because the implications are grim.
This basically means six yearsâ worth of work toward ending third-party cookies in Chromeâwhich might have ultimately made cookies obsolete across all major browsersâhas amounted to nothing.
Reading between the lines of Googleâs bureaucratic language aimed at not alienating advertisers, Privacy Sandbox seems to have been a Hail Mary effort to shift away from the invasive cookies that track us all online, with their famously murky and seemingly coerced approach to consent.
The dream was a built-in Chrome system that would have allowed the data used for ad customization to live on your device. This system would have used AI to sort you into relevant groups of users with certain traits. Had it worked, advertisers would have still been allowed to target you with ads, but without tracking you as an individual.
Needless to say, it would have also put an end to those awful pop-ups.
But according to an announcement Friday by Anthony Chavez, the Google VP in charge of the Privacy Sandbox initiative, “low levels of adoption” have led Google to âretireâ a long list of Privacy Sandbox technologies. AdWeek then managed to get confirmation that this long list of dead sub-projects also spells the end of the broader initiative. Google will be âmoving away from the Privacy Sandbox branding,” according to a spokesperson quoted by Adweek.
This is especially depressing for cookie haters because after years of delays, early last year, it was starting to look like Google was making major progress. Last January Google ended cookie support for about 30 million Chrome users, and the following month it rolled out a privacy-focused preview version of the Android operating system, aimed at speeding adoption of the new ad regime. With about 65% of the browser market share at the time, mass adoption of the Privacy Sandbox system in Chrome could have signaled to advertisers that the cookie era was over.
And apparently, it never took. In April of this year, it became clear that a Google-led effort to end cookies was on the ropes when Chavez wrote that Google would maintain its âcurrent approach to offering users third-party cookie choice in Chrome,â and that it would ânot be rolling out a new standalone prompt for third-party cookies.â This latest announcement is the final nail in the coffin of Googleâs cookie-free internet plan.
We reached out to Google to find out if this means Google is shifting to full-throated support of third-party cookies, or switching to another alternative plan. Weâll update if we hear back.
But with Privacy Sandbox completely gone, itâs clear that somewhere along the line, the long deferred plan fizzled. Individual tracking of users is a load-bearing structure of the free, ad-supported internet, and thatâs not about to change.

10/18 update below. This post was originally published on October 17
Bitcoin has suddenly dropped toward $100,000, accelerating a sell-off that hit the bitcoin price last week and sparked fears of a wider crypto crash.

The bitcoin price has plunged under $105,000 per bitcoin for the first time since June, with traders fearful a huge bitcoin price crash could be just around the corner as the combined crypto market loses $600 billion in just over a week.
Now, as Tesla billionaire Elon Musk breaks his silence on bitcoin, traders are scrambling to predict just how low the bitcoin price could go after it hit an all-time high of around $126,000 earlier this month.

“Some analysts are wringing their hands, thinking bitcoin could drop into the $90,000s or $80,000s,” Lark Davis, the author of the Wealth Mastery newsletter, wrote in an emailed note.
10/18 update: The bitcoin price rout has led to a serious bull market warning, with traders fearful the bitcoin “flash crash” has sapped confidence in a recovery.
“Now that we have broken down below $108,000, I am ready to make the call as to whether we are … looking for a move up to $145,000, or  … we have seen the highs in this market,"" John Glover, the chief investment officer of Ledn, said in emailed comments. ""Here’s my call: The bull run in bitcoin is over.”
Glover, whose bitcoin price prediction could see bitcoin “retest” its all-time high of just over $124,000, has warned the bitcoin crash will drag bitcoin and crypto markets lower through 2026.
“I firmly believe that we have finished the five wave move higher, and we will now commence a bear market that will last into late 2026 at a minimum,” Glover said. ""My expectation is that the bear market will see us trading down to $70,000 to $80,000, and potentially lower. The bear market target will become clearer as we watch the price action unfold in the coming months.""
Meanwhile, other bitcoin price and crypto market analysts have warned “panic selling” could cause extreme volatility in coming weeks.
“The way markets are reacting now is a mix of panic selling, stops triggering, and selective inbound bids as buyers try to pick bottoms,” David Siemer, the chief executive of Wave Digital Assets, said in via email. “We’re probably not seeing a full systemic crash but we are entering an environment where a break below major support levels (e.g. for bitcoin around $100,000) could lead to another leg down.”
However, Siemer is hopeful the bitcoin price and crypto market can stage a rebound before 2026, with a coming Federal Reserve pivot to a more dovish stance opening up the flow of cash into bitcoin and crypto.
“I remain cautiously optimistic for recovery in the fourth quarter,” Siemer said. 
""If we get relief on trade policy, more regulatory clarity, and signs the Fed may pivot, those catalysts could help stabilize the market and restore confidence. I expect a choppy rebound initially, with bitcoin and ethereum leading, and then momentum may expand into strong alts. But any sustained recovery will require cleaned out leverage, fresh capital inflows, and macro tailwinds lining up.”
The sudden bitcoin price sell-off follows a bitcoin price “flash crash” last week, triggered by fears U.S. president Donald Trump is about to reignite the U.S. trade war with China.
“The crypto market resumed its decline on Friday, falling 5% in 24 hours to $3.57 trillion,” Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro, said in emailed comments.
""This time, it looks more like a painful reflex after the events of a week ago. But this is an even more dangerous dynamic because we are not seeing a slip in a thin market, but rather a massive sell-off in search of a new bottom. We will closely monitor market dynamics at the 200-day moving average of $3.5 trillion, where there could be a sharp rebound at the end of June or a further decline in March.""

The bitcoin price has dropped as gold has surged to fresh all-time highs, damaging bitcoin’s reputation as “digital gold.” 
""Bitcoin is now down 32% priced in gold since its August high,"" Peter Schiff, an investor and gold bull who’s known for his opposition to bitcoin, posted to X. “This bitcoin bear market will be brutal. HODLers, sell your fool's gold now and buy the real thing, or have fun going broke.”
The bitcoin price has rocketed over the last year, climbing as U.S. president Donald Trump embraces bitcoin and crypto, Wall Street sees huge demand for its record-breaking bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the so-called “debasement trade” hits the U.S. dollar and other currencies."

A recent 10X Research report has estimated that retail investors lost about $17 billion due to their exposure to Bitcoin treasury companies.
The losses reflect a broader decline in investor enthusiasm for Digital Asset Treasury Companies (DATCOs). Firms such as MicroStrategy and Metaplanet have seen their stocks tumble in tandem with Bitcoin’s recent price slump.
According to the report, many investors turned to these DATCOs to gain indirect exposure to Bitcoin. These firms typically issue shares at a premium to their underlying Bitcoin holdings, using the raised capital to buy more BTC. 
10x Research noted that the strategy worked well when Bitcoin’s price rose, as stock valuations often outpaced the asset’s spot gains. However, as market sentiment cooled and Bitcoin’s momentum faded, those premiums collapsed.
As a result, investors who bought during the frenzy of inflated valuations have collectively lost about $17 billion. The firm also estimated that new shareholders overpaid for Bitcoin exposure by roughly $20 billion through these equity premiums.
These numbers are unsurprising considering BeInCrypto previously reported that global companies have raised over $86 billion in 2025 to buy cryptocurrencies. 
Notably, this figure surpasses the total US initial public offerings this year.
Yet, despite this massive inflow, the performance of Bitcoin-linked equities has recently lagged behind the broader market.
For context, Strategy’s (formerly MicroStrategy) MSTR stock has fallen more than 20% since August. Tokyo-based Metaplanet, according to Strategy Tracker data, also lost over 60% of its value during the same period.
At the same time, their market-to-net-asset-value (mNAV) ratios, once a measure of investor confidence, have also deteriorated.
MicroStrategy now trades around 1.4x its Bitcoin holdings, while Metaplanet has slipped below 1.0x for the first time since adopting its Bitcoin treasury model in 2024.
“Those once-celebrated NAV premiums have collapsed, leaving investors holding the empty cup while executives walked away with the gold,” 10x Research stated.
Across the market, nearly one-fifth of all listed Bitcoin treasury firms reportedly trade below their net asset value.
The contrast is striking given that Bitcoin recently hit a record high above $126,000 this month before pulling back after President Donald Trump’s tariff threats against China.
Still, Brian Brookshire, head of Bitcoin strategy at H100 Group AB, argued that mNAV ratios are cyclical and do not reflect long-term value. H100 Group AB is the largest Bitcoin-holding firm in the Nordic region.
“Most BTCTCs trading near 1x mNAV have only arrived there within the past couple weeks. By definition, not a norm…even for MSTR, there is no such thing as a normal mNAV. It’s a volatile, cyclical phenomenon,” he said.
Nonetheless, analysts at 10X Research said the current episode marks “the end of financial alchemy” for Bitcoin treasuries, where inflated share issuance once created the illusion of limitless upside.
Considering this, the firm stated that these DATCOs will now be judged by earnings discipline rather than market euphoria.
“With volatility falling and the easy gains gone, these firms face a hard pivot from marketing-driven momentum to real market discipline. The next act won’t be about magic—it will be about who can still generate alpha when the audience stops believing,” 10X Research concluded.

47,2025-10-18,"Speaking at a Citadel Securities event on October 6, the Nvidia CEO blamed U.S. export controls and said the company now assumes no revenue from China in its forecasts.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said last week that the company’s share of China’s advanced AI accelerator market has collapsed from roughly 95% to zero as US export controls continue to bite. The comment came during a live interview at Citadel Securities’ Future of Global Markets 2025 event in New York on October 6, in which Huang said, “At the moment, we are 100% out of China,” adding, “We went from 95% market share to 0%.”
A full video of the interview was published on YouTube this week by Citadel Securities and marks the first time Nvidia has publicly quantified the scale of its retreat. Huang didn’t name specific products, but his remarks point squarely to Nvidia’s data center GPU line, which has faced rolling waves of export restrictions since October 2022. The company’s China-focused A800 and H800 parts were rendered noncompliant by export prohibitions in 2023, while a newer design — the H20 — has faced licensing hurdles of its own.
“I can’t imagine any policymaker thinking that’s a good idea, that whatever policy we implemented caused America to lose one of the largest markets in the world to 0%,” Huang said of the outcome.
Nvidia has previously disclosed that China represented between 20% and 25% of its data center revenue — a segment that generated more than $41 billion in its most recent financial results, representing a 56% year-over-year increase. While that figure includes cloud customers across a wide range of workloads, AI infrastructure remains the company’s growth engine. A prolonged clampdown could reshape both demand and supply chains.
The US government has tightened controls over AI accelerators sold to China as part of a broader strategy to limit Beijing’s access to cutting-edge semiconductors. But Huang’s comments highlight how quickly the dynamic has shifted on the ground. “In all of our forecasts… we’re assuming 0% for China,” he said. “If anything happens in China… it will be a bonus.”
Nvidia’s cautious guidance comes amid signs of deeper fragmentation in the AI stack. China’s hyperscalers and AI labs have increasingly turned to domestic silicon or alternative hardware in response to the export curbs, accelerating efforts to localize compute infrastructure. That’s a trend Huang flagged earlier this year, when he warned that blanket restrictions could spur the development of competitive substitutes.
While Huang said that he has hopes that Nvidia’s business can return to China in the future, the company has effectively written off the country for the moment.

Generally speaking, we like monthly dividends better than quarterly payouts. I mean, why wait 90 days to get paid when “every 30” is possible?
Here’s another great thing about monthly divvies—they often have big fat annual yields attached to them.
For example, today we are going to discuss a batch yielding between 8% and 19.8%. On a modest $500,000 in savings, these monthly machines will dish between $40,000 and $99,000 per year!
If we randomly select a few monthly dividend payers, chances are we’ll earn (way!) more. Here’s the difference between the stock market’s monthly dividend stocks and the major indices:
Dividend heroes or yield traps? Let’s look at this four pack in more detail.
We’ll begin with a rarity among rarities—Sabine Royalty Trust (SBR).
Royalty Trusts are among the most passive income vehicles on the market. They exist to own shares in income generated from natural resources (crude oil, natural gas, minerals, etc.), which they turn around and pay back to unitholders, less costs, in the form of distributions. Sabine Royalty Trust, for instance, receives Sabine Corporation’s landowner royalties, overriding royalty interests, minerals, production payments, and more from proved but undeveloped oil-and-gas properties in six states, predominantly in the Permian Basin.
How central are distributions to royalty trusts’ existence? Here’s the first paragraph from the first page of SBR’s most recent earnings report:
Who can argue with a business that has no debt, pays a generous monthly distribution that by nature has to be covered, and has run laps around the broader energy sector?
Well, there are a few oddities we must address.
Sabine Royalty Trust won’t be with us forever, for one. While it technically has no termination date, the company was established to fizzle away one day. Its asset base was established in 1983, and those assets are fixed—SBR can’t acquire new ones, so when their current assets are depleted, they’re gone. The trust itself would likely terminate shortly before that. SBR will terminate if there are two successive fiscal years in which Sabine’s gross revenues from royalty properties are less than $2 million per year, or if unitholders vote for a closure.
Because SBR only collects royalties, it’s extremely sensitive to commodity prices, so it can be far more volatile than the energy sector. The distribution isn’t predictable, either—over the past five years, distributions have ranged between 2.7 cents per share and $1.14 per share. Those distributions aren’t tax-efficient, either; they’re considered ordinary income, so we’re taxed at our marginal rates.
Capital Southwest Corp. (CSWC) is a business development company that provides capital to lower middle market firms with EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of between $3 million and $25 million. Its current portfolio stands at 122 firms—roughly 90% of its deals are first-lien loans, 9% are equity, and the rest are a sprinkling of second-lien and subordinated debt.
The blessing and (more so at the moment) curse of many BDCs is that they deal in a high percentage of floating-rate debt, which is outstanding when rates are rising, less so when they’re declining. And the stock market being what it is, sometimes the connection isn’t perfect—BDCs can just as easily trade on expectations for policy as it can the policy itself:
However, in CSWC’s case, some Fed pain now might be a blessing in disguise.
The BDC industry is a difficult one that, as a whole, tends to lag the market. But a few individuals stand out, and CSWC is one of them, clobbering its peers and outperforming the S&P 500 over the long term. It’s internally managed (so external managers aren’t bleeding fees from it), it has moderate leverage, the dividend is well-covered and, as of summer 2025, those dividends are paid on a monthly basis. Most of its high dividend is attributable to its regular dividend, but CSWC kicks in supplementals that account for another percentage point or so of yield.
So why would lower rates be a blessing for a company that wants higher rates? They won’t be—at least not for Capital Southwest. But they could provide a little relief for prospective buyers who don’t want to pay the current 21% premium to net asset value (NAV) for shares.
Another BDC, PennantPark Floating Rate Capital (PFLT), which targets midsized companies that generate $10 million to $50 million in annual EBITDA.
PFLT effectively invests us in more than 190 portfolio companies spread across over 110 PE sponsors. It’s also a “value-added” BDC that lends its expertise in specific industries, hence its portfolio focus on five categories: health care, software and technology, consumer, business services and government services.
And the name pretty much says it all. PennantPark Floating Rate does about 90% of its funding through first-lien debt, almost all of which is floating-rate in nature. (The remaining 10% is made up of equity co-investments and joint venture equity.)
Like with CSWC, it’s clear that rates are the straw that stirs PFLT’s performance.
I’ve previously looked at PFLT and noted that its dividend coverage was getting tight. It’s getting tighter, too, with the dividend outstripping NII across a few quarters over the past year-plus. A dividend reduction is at least in the realm of possibility, though management believes that joint venture growth (including a new JV, PennantPark Senior Secured Loan Fund II) and additional leverage can help it meet its NII needs. Wall Street may be a little skeptical; PFLT trades at a 20% discount to NAV.
REITs are well-known for their above-average dividends, but if we want to test the upper limits, we want to look at mortgage REITs.
Most REITs are equity REITs, which own (and sometimes operate) physical real estate. But mortgage REITs purchase stacks of paper with a business model that goes something like this:
And whereas you can commonly find nice yields in the mid-single-digits among equity REITs, it’s extremely common to find double-digit yields in the mREIT space.
Orchid Island Capital (ORC) is one such mREIT dealing in agency residential mortgage-backed securities (read: Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, etc.), including fixed-rate pass-through securities, interest-only securities and inverse interest-only securities. It’s externally managed and advised by Bimini Advisors. And its yield is in the stratosphere, currently just shy of 20%.
We discussed another mREIT with a rising dividend a couple weeks ago, and I mentioned that “Generally speaking, the Federal Reserve’s easing should be a boon for mREITs, including the potential for improving originations in the residential space.”
In fact, you can see ORC’s improving health over the past two years or so as the rate environment has improved.
Orchid Island’s long-term total return since its 2013 initial public offering is bad enough. But the massive dividend papers over a trainwreck of a price performance, with shares off 90% since that IPO. The declines have been so precipitous that just a few years ago, ORC had to initiate a 1-for-5 reverse stock split; without it, shares today would trade for less than $2.
And as the chart above shows, ORC has no compunction about reducing its dividend at the drop of a hat.

    Scientists trained an AI model to identify avocados at perfect ripeness, saving you from throwing away rotten ones.
  
Food waste is one of the most critical global issues and this AI-driven app aims to mitigate that. 
Avocados are delicious, good with a variety of meals and nutrient-dense. But I don't buy them anymore. Without a doubt, I've pitched whole avocados more than any other produce. Why? Because there's seemingly only a 15-second window between when the avocado is rock hard and complete mush. And I always miss it. 
But those days may be numbered and it's shockingly thanks to AI. 
Researchers at Oregon State University and Florida State University have developed a smartphone-powered AI that can tell exactly when an avocado is perfectly ripe. Using more than 1,400 iPhone photos of Hass avocados, the team trained a deep-learning model that can predict firmness, the key sign of ripeness, with over 90% accuracy. The AI analyzes subtle cues in texture, color and shape that most humans would miss.
""Avocados are among the most wasted fruits globally due to overripeness,"" said Luyao Ma, an assistant professor at OSU. ""Our goal was to create a tool that helps consumers and retailers make smarter decisions about when to use or sell avocados.""
Food waste is one of the most critical global issues. Nearly a third of everything grown, harvested and produced for human consumption never makes it to the table and goes to waste. In the US, federal agencies have pledged to cut that loss in half by 2030, a goal that calls for innovation across the food system, such as an app that can tell you when it's time to eat a fruit. 
""Avocados are just the beginning,"" Ma said. ""This technology could be applied much more broadly, helping consumers, retailers and distributors make smarter decisions and reduce waste.""

Home » BMW X5 Conquers 2025 Rebelle Rally, Wins Bone Stock Class
   Horatiu Boeriu  
 October 18, 2025  /  2 minutes read
After eight long days and nearly 1,700 miles across the California and Nevada desert, the BMW X5 has claimed first place in the Bone Stock category and second overall in the X-Cross class at the 2025 Rebelle Rally. Behind the wheel were Rebecca Donaghe and Rebecca Dalski, BMW of North America’s Product Manager, who guided a nearly factory-stock X5 through one of the toughest navigation challenges in North America.

The Rebelle Rally isn’t about speed. It’s about accuracy, endurance, and teamwork. Over eight days, competitors use only maps and compasses to find hidden checkpoints scattered across vast stretches of desert. GPS devices are banned. Getting one bearing wrong can mean hours of lost time — or missing the day’s goal entirely.
From October 11 to 17, the two Rebeccas piloted their BMW X5 xDrive40i across every type of terrain the desert could throw at them: dunes, rocky washes, dry lakebeds, and gravel tracks. The event tests not only driver and navigator but also the durability of the vehicles they bring.

The X5 competed in the Bone Stock category, where teams are allowed almost no modifications. Aside from off-road tires in the original size, a roof rack, and essential recovery gear, this X5 was the same as one built in Spartanburg, South Carolina. Power came from the familiar 3.0-liter inline-six engine with xDrive all-wheel drive and a mild-hybrid system producing 375 horsepower.
That setup — plus drive modes like xSand, xGravel, xSnow, and xRock — was enough to carry the team through some of the rally’s hardest sections, including the infamous “Dunes Day.” Staying on pace through deep, shifting sand required careful throttle work, momentum, and a steady hand.
For Dalski, the rally was a hands-on way to experience BMW’s engineering in conditions few customers will ever face. As navigator, Dalski relied entirely on analog tools — compass, ruler, and map — while Donaghe focused on the driving.

BMW’s Rebelle program has grown steadily in recent years. In 2023, an X2 M35i finished second in its class. The following year, an X3 M50 carried the brand’s colors through another strong showing.

Oppo Android Rumors

Oppo launched the Find X9 and Find X9 Pro yesterday, and today we already have a fresh rumor out of China regarding the upcoming Find X9s.
The Find X8s, its predecessor, came out in April, so we should expect a similar timeframe for the X9s' arrival on the market as well. The Find X9s is said to be a compact flagship, and the X8s boasts a 6.32"" screen so maybe the X9s will have a similar size.
Despite its petite dimensions, the Find X9s will still pack a 7,000 mAh battery, which would be a significant jump up from its predecessor's 5,700 mAh cell.
The Find X8s was powered by MediaTek's Dimensity 9400+ SoC, so if MediaTek releases a Dimensity 9500+, then surely that will be inside the X9s. The X9s is expected to launch alongside the Find X9 Ultra, and perhaps the Find X9s+ too if history repeats itself.
The Find X9s' design will be very heavily inspired by that of the Find X9, so don't expect anything new in that department.

Well, considering when new SoC are released (few weeks ago) then I'd say Samsung is few months late with their Galaxy. 
Just a rumor making phone equal or better than best flagship of 2025 which is Xiaomi 15 ultra and same specs but size of 6 inch device with a 7000 mAh cell is impossible. 
Find x9 global releasing this or next month depend on region. S26Ultra may released next year. This x9s will be released before galaxy 8flip.

It has been a pretty quiet week in the US market as far as smartphones are concerned, but Apple did unveil the M5 chipset and launched three new products with it. But let’s start with phones and with no new launches, we turn to the usual suspects.
The Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge has reportedly been canceled, to be replaced with the Galaxy S26+ - a phone that was once rumored to have been canceled itself. So, the Galaxy S25 Edge may remain Samsung’s thinnest phone for a while. It’s not as capable as its S25+ sibling, but at least it’s a lot cheaper.
Here’s the Samsung Galaxy S25+ for reference. You can check out our head-to-head article for an in-depth look at how the S25+ and S25 Edge compare.
The Nothing Phone (3) is another experiment with a questionable outcome – Nothing is trying to break into the flagship market. It certainly has its strengths, but it’s not up to competing with the top models from other makers. It is cheaper than those phones, though, so things like the LTPS display and average battery life don’t hurt as much. And it still has a versatile triple 50MP camera, a mostly clean UI, good speakers and the 6.67” 120Hz OLED display is pretty bright.
You can accessorize it with the Nothing Headphone (1), which has the same white and transparent look (though black and transparent is an option too). These are fairly heavy, but offer excellent sound quality and active noise cancellation. The build quality is great too.
Alternatively, the CMF Headphone Pro are much more “normal” looking and are a lot cheaper – even with the discount on the Headphone (1), these are less than half the price. We are working on a review for the CMF headphones, but the first impressions are great.
The Motorola Razr 2025 has been at $600 for a while now and this week is no different. This discount is no longer good enough.
The Motorola Razr+ 2025 uses some older hardware (it’s a re-release of the Razr Ultra 2024 but with an improved IP rating), but now it has a hefty discount that puts it at the same $600 price point as the vanilla Razr 2025. With the Plus model you get a Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 and faster UFS 4.0 storage (vs. Dimensity 7400X and UFS 2.2) plus a 50MP 2x telephoto camera (vs. 13MP 120° ultra-wide). The battery is smaller (4,000mAh vs. 4,500mAh) but has a slight lead in charging (45W wired vs. 30W, wireless charging is 15W on both phones).
There’s always the new Ultra, which has settled at the $1,000 mark. The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 beats its predecessor (and thus the Plus) with a Snapdragon 8 Elite and a larger 50MP sensor in the main camera (1/1.56” vs. 1/1.95”). It also has a bigger, faster battery – 4,700mAh with 68W wired and 30W wireless charging.
Of course, the Ultra competes with the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip7, which has a small price advantage. Note that this year the US model uses the same Exynos 2500 as the models for the rest of the world. The 50MP main camera has a similarly-sized 1/1.57” sensor and it is joined by a 12MP ultra-wide module. The 4,300mAh battery is slow to charge at 25W over a wire and at 15W wirelessly.
You could save some money by going with the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip7 FE. This is another re-release of a 2024 model, though Samsung changed the chipset – gone is the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 of the Z Flip6, replaced by an Exynos 2400. You can read more about how the Z Flip7 FE compares with the Z Flip7 for a closer look at what you are giving up to save $124 by picking the FE model.
The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold7 has a solid $400 discount, which places it $200 below its rival, the newly-launched Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold. We haven’t reviewed the Pixel yet, but we’ve done the rest of the Pixel 10 series and we can already tell you that the Tensor G5 is no match for the Snapdragon 8 Elite (yes, the Z Fold7 uses the Qualcomm chip, unlike the Z Flip7). The Pixel foldable is also thicker (10.8mm vs. 8.9mm) and heavier (258g vs. 215g), though it does have a larger battery (5,015mAh vs. 4,400mAh).
As we mentioned in the opening paragraph, Apple introduced the M5 chipset and it upgraded the iPad Pro 11” and 13” models with it. They also use other Apple chips – the N1 and C1X – so they have Wi-Fi 7 connectivity. Additionally, the USB-C port now features Adaptive Sync (variable refresh rate) up to 120Hz when hooked up to a compatible display (check your TV, a lot of OLEDs support this).
Apple also revamped the MacBook Pro with a new 14” model. However, this one uses Broadcom chips for wireless connectivity, so it only has Wi-Fi 6E. New chipset aside, the new Apple MacBook Pro 14” is largely the same as its M4 predecessor.

Imagine an EDC knife so thin it disappears in your pocket (or even your wallet), yet feels as solid and capable as a full-sized tool. That’s the engineering marvel behind Vosteed’s Parallel series. With a thickness of just 0.28 inches and a weight barely brushing 2.36 ounces, this knife shatters expectations of what an EDC blade can be, while titanium handles, crackle textures, and new blade geometries add futuristic flair to a minimal, stealthy form.
Vosteed dropped three new Parallel configurations this year, and they’re worth paying attention to. Two variants run S35VN steel with what they’re calling “Crackle” finishes (Arctic Crackle in silver-gold, Iridescent Crackle in full rainbow), and a third introduces the line’s first tanto blade in 154CM with a Destroyer Grey titanium treatment. GearPatrol has been all over these releases, and for good reason: the Parallel keeps selling out faster than Vosteed can restock them. When a knife this slim packs a crossbar lock and actual usability, people notice.
Designer: Vosteed In-house Design

The Parallel measures 7.04 inches open with a 2.9-inch blade, putting it right in that sweet spot for daily tasks without feeling like you’re lugging around a combat folder. The handle sits at 4.13 inches, and here’s where things get interesting: that 0.28-inch profile (7.1mm if you prefer metric) makes this thinner than a pack of gum. For context, The James Brand’s Ellis Slim, which made waves for its own minimalist build, clocks in at 8mm. Vosteed went thinner and somehow kept a full-strength locking mechanism. That’s the kind of engineering that makes you stop and wonder how they pulled it off. Titanium handles keep the weight down without sacrificing durability, and the ambidextrous crossbar lock means lefties and righties get equal treatment. Dual thumb studs, reversible wire clip, triangle lanyard hole: all the functional bits are present and accounted for.

The blade geometry choices tell you a lot about how Vosteed sees this knife being used. The reverse tanto on the S35VN models balances slicing performance with tip strength, giving you a point that can handle detail work without being as fragile as a drop point or as aggressive as a full tanto. It’s the kind of blade shape that works equally well opening Amazon boxes, cutting paracord, prepping food at a campsite, or handling light prying tasks you probably shouldn’t be doing with a folder anyway. The full tanto on the 154CM variant leans harder into piercing and controlled cuts, with that reinforced tip and angular geometry that excels at puncturing tough materials. Both shapes sit at 2.9 inches, which means you’re working with enough blade length to be useful without crossing into territory that makes HR nervous if someone spots it clipped to your pocket at the office. The satin and brushed finishes on the S35VN models keep maintenance straightforward, while the stonewashed and coated options hide wear better if you’re rougher on your gear.

The Parallel targets a specific type of user: someone who wants a legitimate tool but refuses to tolerate pocket bulk. If you’re the kind of person who evaluates every item in your carry by weight and volume, who resents unnecessary thickness in wallets, flashlights, and knives, this design makes sense. It appeals to minimalists who still need cutting capability, urban carriers who value discretion over tactical presence, and gear nerds who appreciate engineering solutions to design constraints. The slim profile means you can stack this with other EDC items without creating an uncomfortable lump, and at 2.36 ounces it won’t drag your pocket down or require constant readjustment. That said, if you have large hands or prefer a fuller grip, the 4.13-inch handle might feel less substantial than chunkier folders. The titanium scales provide durability without the heft of G10 or micarta, but they also lack the texture and warmth those materials offer. Vosteed built this for people who prioritize portability and precision over hand-filling comfort, and that trade-off is deliberate, calculated, and completely transparent in the design language.

We start with fawning over the Arctic Crackle – a visual direction we haven’t really seen in EDC before. You’ll see Damascus patterns, anodized finishes, maybe even some heat-treated rainbow ones, or glow-in-the-dark variants… but this crackle finish is truly eye-catching and unique. Vosteed achieved this through precision laser engraving alone, no anodizing trickery or color-shifting coatings. The silver titanium base gets etched with golden crackle patterns that catch light differently depending on angle, giving the handle a constantly shifting presence. According to their own product notes, they ran “numerous trials adjusting beam intensity and engraving sequences” to nail the look. That level of obsessive iteration shows in the final product. The effect mimics fractured ice or dried earth, organic yet meticulously controlled. It’s the kind of texture that photographs well but feels even better in hand, adding grip without aggressive jimping or rubberized inserts.

The Iridescent Crackle goes harder on the visual drama. Rainbow anodizing meets black crackle laser work, creating something that looks like it belongs in a cyberpunk prop collection. This one uses controlled voltage anodizing combined with laser engraving to lock in the color spectrum permanently. It’s loud, unapologetically flashy, and probably polarizing depending on your aesthetic tolerance. If you carry gear as a form of self-expression, this variant leans all the way into that philosophy. If you prefer your tools to blend into the background, the Arctic or Destroyer Grey options offer more restraint.

Speaking of the Destroyer Grey: this is the tactical-minded variant with a tanto blade. The 154CM steel gets a grey titanium coating for added surface hardness and wear resistance, plus that low-glare finish that’s become standard in hard-use knives. The tanto geometry brings a reinforced tip and angular lines suited to piercing and controlled cutting tasks. Vosteed positions this as the “tactical clarity” option, and the grey-on-grey colorway backs that up. It’s utilitarian in the best sense, form following function without excess decoration. The coating does double duty as protection and aesthetics, which is the kind of practical design choice that doesn’t need marketing fluff to justify itself.

All three variants use that same slim titanium frame and crossbar lock, which raises an obvious question: how does a lock mechanism this robust fit into such a thin package? Crossbar locks typically require more internal real estate than frame locks or liner locks. Vosteed clearly did the math on material tolerances and load distribution to make this work. The lock bar runs horizontally behind the blade tang when open, and titanium’s strength-to-weight ratio allows for thinner stock without compromising structural integrity. It’s a clever bit of problem-solving that lets the Parallel stay competitive with slimmer designs that use weaker locking systems.

Pricing sits at $129 for the 154CM tanto and $169 for the S35VN variants. That puts the Parallel in a competitive bracket with other premium EDC folders, though arguably on the lower end given the materials and engineering involved. S35VN is a proven performer with excellent edge retention and corrosion resistance, while 154CM offers solid durability at a slightly lower price point. Both steels handle daily cutting tasks without fuss, and both sharpen reasonably well when the time comes. You’re not dealing with exotic super steels here, which honestly works in the knife’s favor. Practical, proven, reliable.

The Parallel delivers on the promise of minimal carry without the usual compromises. Thin knives often sacrifice lock strength, blade length, or handle ergonomics to hit their size targets. Vosteed kept all three intact while adding legitimate style options that go beyond basic black or stonewashed finishes. Whether that matters depends on how you view your EDC gear, but the engineering speaks for itself regardless of finish preference. A 7.1mm folder with a crossbar lock and titanium construction is worth attention, and the fact that it keeps selling out within hours of dropping suggests the market agrees.

67,2025-10-18,"Last week's massive crypto crash didn’t just hit traders, it also wiped out millions in stolen funds held by hackers who, caught in the panic, misplayed the market with disastrous timing.
Blockchain sleuth Lookonchain has tracked at least six wallets linked to known hackers that lost more than $13.4 million after panic-selling ether ETH$3,868.71 during the downturn.
These hackers panic-sold 7,816 $ETH($29.14M) at $3,728 during the market drop, losing another $3.37M! In total, 6 hacker wallets have lost over $13.4M recently from buying high and selling low on $ETH! https://t.co/OMoK1lw40Ohttps://t.co/LPrQauiW5C pic.twitter.com/D58dGXjJ9W
The hackers in question appear to be part of a group of cybercriminals who have recently engaged in cryptocurrency theft. The mention of ""6 hacker wallets"" losing over $13.4 million suggests a coordinated effort, possibly linked to a known hacking syndicate.
The sell-off began when one wallet offloaded 7,816 ETH at $3,728 per coin, a move that coincided with the steepest part of the crash. As prices dropped further, five more wallets followed suit, contributing to the broader market dump.
However, rather than holding the sold assets in stablecoins or attempting to launder the ETH, the hackers rebought the same amount — 7,816 ETH — at $4,159 as the markets bounced back, locking in another round of losses.
By Oct. 18, blockchain analysis revealed that the total loss from these trading missteps reached $13.4 million.
Given the scale of the funds (about $29 million in the latest transaction alone), these hackers are likely sophisticated actors with access to advanced tools for exploiting vulnerabilities in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, exchanges, or smart contracts.
The hackers' trading patterns during volatile market conditions suggest that while they're experienced in exploiting the ecosystem's players, they react to market swings like any other over-leveraged trader would: with poor timing and emotional decision-making.
Lookonchain labeled the behavior as “panic selling,” while some crypto observers even joked that the attackers might be “great hackers, terrible traders.”
However, the hackers likely acquired those funds through hacking. So while the losses are real, the funds were likely not earned but stolen. 
Blockchain analysts believe the ETH originated from earlier attacks, meaning the hackers were trading with assets they hadn’t bought in the first place.
In that sense, the losses may not hurt in the way they would for ordinary traders. 
Think of it this way: someone finds a suitcase of cash, gambles it poorly, and walks away empty-handed. They’re worse off than before but not out-of-pocket, since the money they lost wasn't theirs in the first place. 
Maybe the hacker group should've just stuck with hacking and maybe start looking for a portfolio manager for criminals. Still, the missteps reveal something about the current state of the crypto landscape. Even sophisticated attackers can falter under pressure. 
There's another possibility out there. While they were 'terrible traders', they may also have been laundering their ill-gotten gains through these trades, strategically dumping tainted funds during the panic to then buy back clean funds, even if at a loss.
As one X poster said, ""It's a form of money laundering. While they are puking, on the other side, they are buying. Then they reverse after it rises. Loose the stolen money, earn on fresh money.""
The Oct. 10 market correction affected traders across the board, triggered by a combination of macroeconomic pressures and thinning liquidity in decentralized markets that led to a $500 billion slump.
While hacks and exploits are usually viewed in isolation, last week’s developments show how on-chain markets, by design, apply the same rules to everyone: whether they’re retail traders, whales, or hackers.

69,2025-10-18,"The native token of the BNB Chain, BNB, climbed more than 3% in the last 24 hours, as a mix of institutional momentum and strategic selling shaped its trading session entering the weekend.
The token rallied from $1,056 to $1,087, peaking at $1,131 in early morning trading before pulling back slightly. It’s outperforming the wider crypto market, which rose 2.43% in the last 24 hours, based on the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index.
Profit-taking near resistance levels could be the cause of the late dip. Trading volume hit 204,000 tokens, almost three times the daily average, underscoring active participation from market players, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model.
Behind the price action is a wave of growing adoption. Coinbase recently added BNB to its list of assets being considered for full platform support after the launch of the exchange’s new “Blue Carpet” initiative.
On top of that, China Merchants Bank International (CMBI) tokenized its USD money market fund on the BNB Chain, issuing two tokens, CMBMINT and CMBIMINT, for accredited investors.
BNB Chain, the blockchain that BNB powers, also hit a milestone with over 3.6 million daily active addresses last week, according to DeFiLlama, the highest in its history.
Corporate accumulation has also grown, with Hong Kong-listed investment bank China Renaissance reportedly planning a $600 million to build a BNB-focused treasury.
Still, BNB remains 17% below its all-time high of $1,370. The token's recent volatility, marked by a $79 intraday spread range, suggests traders are struggling to price-in rising demand against broader market unease.

• Large holders liquidated $74 million in Dogecoin amid broader market declines due to tariff concerns.
• Trading volumes peaked at 1.4 billion, establishing strong support near $0.18.
Dogecoin stabilized Friday after early volatility saw price drop to $0.176 before recovering into a tight $0.18–$0.19 range. The session’s 7% swing came amid renewed macro jitters and reports of large whale liquidations totaling over $74 million.
What to Know• DOGE traded between $0.176 and $0.189 through Oct 17, 06:00 – Oct 18, 05:00 UTC, a 6.7% range.• Trading volumes topped 1.4B during the 07:00–08:00 UTC selloff, setting strong support near $0.18.• Large holders reportedly offloaded 360M DOGE ($74M) as broader crypto markets dropped 6% on tariff headlines.• Price rebounded steadily to close around $0.186, forming higher lows across afternoon sessions.• Futures positioning remained mixed as traders weighed Fed policy signals against inflation risks.News BackgroundThe morning dip tracked cross-market weakness following the Trump administration’s 100% tariff declaration on Chinese imports — a move that sent risk assets lower across Asia. DOGE faced early liquidation pressure but found stability as whales and market makers absorbed supply near $0.18. Analysts noted a heavy concentration of bids around that level, suggesting accumulation rather than capitulation. Meanwhile, derivative funding rates normalized after a brief spike in short positioning, indicating sentiment is stabilizing.Price Action Summary• Sharp decline from $0.188 → $0.176 at 07:00 UTC on >1.4B volume — the day’s capitulation move.• Recovery through mid-session saw DOGE reclaim $0.184–$0.187, consolidating for remainder of the day.• Final hour (04:22–05:21 UTC): test of $0.1853 low met with 10.5M volume spike, followed by steady bounce to $0.1862.• Resistance persisted at $0.188–$0.189 zone with multiple failed breakout attempts.• Tight late-session range ($0.1860–$0.1862) and declining volume signal positioning pause ahead of catalysts.Technical Analysis• Support – $0.175–$0.180 remains a critical accumulation zone; buyers defended lows with high conviction.• Resistance – $0.188–$0.190 marks upper consolidation band; breakout could target $0.20+.• Volume – Peak activity at 1.4B; volume compression late session supports equilibrium formation.• Pattern – Narrow band consolidation following morning flush indicates volatility coil.• Momentum – RSI neutral near 49; MACD flattening — neither trend dominant yet.What Traders Are Watching• Confirmation of $0.18 as a short-term base ahead of weekend sessions.• Renewed whale flows — whether accumulation continues after $74M disposal.• Potential rotation into meme assets amid ETF optimism next week.• Fed commentary on tariffs and liquidity impact on speculative flows.• Breakout above $0.19 as trigger for retest of $0.20–$0.21 zone.

XRP is showing renewed strength after weeks of steep declines, emerging as the day’s top performer among major cryptocurrencies.
According to BeInCrypto data, the token climbed more than 4% in the past 24 hours to trade near $2.38, rebounding from a $2.25 low on October 17. Notably, this was its weakest price level since early July.
Blockchain analytics firm Santiment reported that XRP’s recovery coincided with a sharp rise in mid- to large-sized holders.
According to the firm, the number of wallets holding at least 10,000 XRP has reached an all-time high of roughly 317,500. This increase suggests that investors used the recent pullback to accumulate rather than exit.
📊 XRP's price has rebounded back a modest +5.3% since its bottom 12 hours ago. A good long-term sign is   the amount of mid to large stakeholders continues to grow. There are now an all-time high ~317.5K wallets with at least 10K $XRP.🔗 Chart link: https://t.co/iI8L53Ue7a pic.twitter.com/qOom9t876s
Notably, this pattern mirrors previous accumulation phases observed since November 2024, when XRP first broke above $1. 
Since then, each XRP price correction has been followed by renewed buying pressure from investors who are increasingly confident in Ripple’s ecosystem and long-term roadmap.
At the same time, open interest in XRP futures has fallen sharply to $3.49 billion, according to CoinGlass data. This is its lowest level since June.
Market analysts noted that the decline in leveraged positions signals reduced speculative activity and a shift toward more defensive investor behavior. 
Historically, such declines in open interest often coincide with market bottoms, where selling exhaustion gives way to recovery phases.
Beyond on-chain signals, Ripple’s corporate strategy may also be fueling market optimism for the digital asset.
This week, reports emerged that the firm is preparing a $1 billion Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) company to manage and accumulate XRP as part of its long-term reserves.
Ripple has spent roughly $3 billion on acquisitions of major firms, including Metaco, Hidden Road, Rail, and GTreasury, over the past two years. These purchases aim to build an integrated corporate finance stack for the token and its Ripple USD (RLUSD) stablecoin.
Adding to this positive outlook, speculation is mounting that the US Securities and Exchange Commission could soon approve an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). 
Indeed, the anticipation has driven a spike in applications for leveraged XRP ETF products. This surge highlights both renewed institutional interest and a growing appetite among investors for higher-risk exposure.
Together, these developments point to a deep belief in XRP’s resilience and Ripple’s long-term strategic vision of bolstering the token’s global adoption.

Microsoft ended official support for Windows 10 last week, which means an entirely new population has been forced to move to Windows 11, or be left behind.

According to IT Media, shops in Tokyo's bustling Akihabara area are suddenly experiencing a meteoric rise in Windows 11 demand, alongside one other oddity — optical drives.
Yes, disc drives are apparently back in fashion in Japan as interest in switching to Windows 11 has ""peaked"" and only continues to increase there. People upgrading to the new operating system want to likely keep their physical media collection accessible, which has made disc drives a commodity. Unfortunately, they're out of stock pretty much anywhere, especially if you're looking for an internal Blu-ray drive (BD-R), which are a tier above the standard DVD-R options... but even those are scarce.
 



""Many people may prioritize writing speed and want an internal drive. With external drives, there's inevitably a limit to how fast they can be,"" says Dospara Akihabara Main Shop, a popular computer parts vendor in the region. Another retailer explained how internal disc drives are largely overlooked now since most modern PC cases don't have slots for proper optical drives. In pursuit of cleaner aesthetics and SSDs becoming mainstream, it doesn't make sense to account for the heat dissipation of an internal drive, especially with power-hungry GPUs.
There's little sense of urgency in upgrading from Windows 10 to 11, compared to how quickly people adopted Windows 10 when its predecessors became outdated. Still, the demand to carry over physical media support, especially in the age of perpetual licensing, seems to be more alive than ever. People building new systems solely for the reason of getting on board with Windows 11 are now in the market for disc drives, which is likely the main driver behind this sudden trend.
Another shop in Akihabara, TSUKUMO eX., highlighted how ""There are quite a few people who want to install an optical drive in their machine in a Windows 11 environment, just like they did in Windows 10,"" corroborating that even if the West has generally moved on, Japan still loves its discs.

77,2025-10-18,"In the second hall, there were many booths and not just the ones that were indie or hardware related. There were also middleware companies and many other services, such as vendors proposing AI models to speed up asset creation and more stuff in that field. As I was walking around, what caught my attention very quickly was the Alibaba Cloud booth. Everyone knows the company that is behind AliExpress, but maybe some of you are not aware that they also are an AI model powerhouse, with very effective teams developing models under the Qwen and Wan brand names. Those are very advanced models and they also happen to be frequently released as open weights, so that you can run them on your own hardware if you have what it takes.

I had a conversation with one of the employees at the booth who could tell me a bit more about what’s happening in more details.
Let me just preface this by saying that is all hearsay and that I have no proof of everything I have heard. But at the same time, the person I talked to seemed to speak honestly so I don’t think the following was just some of exagerated bullshit.
First, the team(s) behind the Qwen models are apparently in the hundreds of engineers (most of them probably AI specialists responsible in one way or another of the training preparation, the testing, and the deployment of such models). Because they had issues with ByteDance (the company behind TikTok) poaching employees from Alibaba, now whoever is working on AI models and what they are actually doing in such capacity has become a major secret business, and even Alibaba employees themselves cannot get this information from their internal employee listings. The competition is ruthless!
When you want to develop AI models, one of the biggest problem to solve is access to large amounts of compute. Alibaba has access to Nvidia processors, not the H100 or H200 which are not allowed to be sold to China at the moment, but they can still get their hands on H20 GPUs, and some other models while it lasts.

Recently China has announced that they will be blocking imports of Nvidia GPUs altogether. In any case, the person at the booth could tell me that Alibaba has already developed and rolled out their own compute chip internally (which seems to be running on a 7nm lithography), that they can use to replace Nvidia (at least for inference). Note this is recently corroborated by other sources, such as this article from SCMP. For training, Nvidia GPUs are still better at this stage.
When I asked about the important topic of CUDA and PyTorch compatibility, he mentioned that they already have developed their own CUDA-like support, that is not 100% compatible, but works well enough for their internal uses at Alibaba.
I wondered if they were going to enter the market for GPU or compute cards since they have such capabilities internally, and it seems like they have no such intent. In any case, China is catching up and it may very well be that in a few years they mostly don’t need Nvidia anymore to develop, train and run their own AI models. That would be the first country to be able to be independent from Nvidia in that regard.
As we were talking he was showing me the preview version of WAN 2.5 (that had just came out the previous day!) and that is already able to generate videos up to 10 seconds, with sound at the same time!

You can try WAN 2.5 online directly on the Alibaba site (and avoid the hundreds of spammy sites that pretend to give you free access…)
Video generation is already very impressive compared to what we had 1 year ago. But it is still very limited, generating anything beyond a few seconds to make some kind of movie is just very hard to produce at this stage. But… 2 years, 5 years from now? Who knows.
Alibaba also offers some game streaming capabilities. Basically game streaming as a service, where you don’t have to rely on the usual vendors, but use the existing Alibaba infrastructure instead (and their GPUs if needed). It seems that their stack runs on Linux. Their key competitive advantage was apparently fairly low latency (I could see a demo of a 2D game running off that service) and reduced cost compared to other services.
While they could not tell the actual name of that company, there is apparently a fairly big Japanese company which is providing such game streaming services in Japan, leveraging the Alibaba Cloud infrastructure. I would not be surprised since there are many players in that space.
They have a whole array of services aimed at the Gaming category, such as content distribution, game server management, and streaming as we have just alluded to.
However, my counterpart at the booth mentioned that game streaming is not as popular of a concept as it was a few years ago, so it does not make headlines as much these days.
This is going to be a recurring theme. China was everywhere at the TGS 2025. Usually it was about outsourcing, but more and more they are becoming key players in many areas. In AI models, in gaming, and soon new challengers in the semi-conductor business. TSMC is still ahead, but the question is for how long… In terms of infra and services, Alibaba Cloud is probably a minor player worldwide compared to AWS, but AWS is so expensive and so predominant that this whole business needs a lot more competition.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

TeamGroup has announced its new T-Force Z54E, a PCIe 5.0 SSD designed to trade blows with the best SSDs on the market. Notably, the Z54E isn't just another PCIe 5.0 drive but the first retail SSD to launch with Phison's high-performance E28 SSD controller, setting it apart from the competition.
The E28 controller signifies a substantial advancement over its predecessor, the E26 controller. Utilizing TSMC's 6nm process technology, the E28 delivers enhanced performance and superior power efficiency. Furthermore, the E28 serves as Phison's response to Silicon Motion's SM2508, which has been expanding its presence within the PCIe 5.0 market segment. With the introduction of the E28, Phison endeavors to reestablish its position as the leading manufacturer of PCIe 5.0 controllers.
The Z54E will be one of many consumer PCIe 5.0 M.2 2280 drives employing the Phison E28 controller. TeamGroup does not specify the particular type of flash memory used in the Z54E, only indicating that it is constructed with ""high-density 3D TLC NAND flash."" If an inference must be made, it is likely to utilize a 232-layer NAND, suggesting that TeamGroup may potentially be sourcing the flash from Micron or YMTC.

The Z54E delivers sequential read and write speeds up to 14,900 MB/s and 14,000 MB/s, respectively, in its 4TB and 2TB configurations. The 1TB model, representing the lowest capacity SKU, operates with a sequential write speed approximately 300 MB/s lower. TeamGroup has not disclosed the random performance metrics for the Z54E. The drive is equipped with a DRAM cache; however, the capacity has not been specified by TeamGroup. Additionally, the company has not released the random performance figures for the Z54E.
Endurance performance on the Z54E is not too bad. The 1TB model is rated for 600 TBW, a figure that is subsequently doubled as capacity increases. The endurance levels are comparable to those of competing drives, such as the Sandisk WD Black SN8100 and Samsung 9100 Pro.
The Z54E will be equipped with TeamGroup's patented ultra-thin graphene heatsink to enhance heat dissipation. It appears that the company is not providing a version incorporating its T-Force Dark Flow active SSD cooler on this occasion. Considering that the E28 draws a maximum of approximately 7W, the Z54E is likely adequately cooled without the need for a chunky active cooling solution.
TeamGroup supports the Z54E with a limited five-year warranty. The company did not disclose the pricing or availability; however, we have contacted them for further information. We will provide updates to this report once the company responds.

Artificial intelligence is changing finance in a big way. Firms are trying to figure out how to get a competitive edge, and keep it, as previously impossible tasks and analysis become not just possible, but in many cases, easy.
Presumably, individuals are trying to do this, too. The best example is probably market forecasting. If you know a way to prompt an AI to successfully predict stock activity, Burton Malkiel’s “random walk on Wall Street” becomes – well, something else.
Here’s how writers explain it at AI Edge Daily, where there’s a roundup of related articles on financial change in the AI era.
“For those who want to invest but don’t have the time (or knowledge) to do it manually, AI is stepping in. Robo-advisors like Betterment, Wealthfront, and even some newer blockchain-based platforms now use AI to optimize portfolios based on user goals and market conditions. Instead of paying high fees to a traditional advisor, users can access diversified portfolios, automatic rebalancing, and tax-loss harvesting — all powered by algorithms. In 2025, AI doesn’t just manage investments; it adjusts them proactively based on risk profiles, financial goals, and real-time data.”
But beyond just market predictions (which is huge) there are other innovations to apply, too: banks are using AI for fraud detection, financial planning, and high-frequency trading (maybe another flavor of market manipulation, but with its own bailiwick), not to mention compliance, and customer-facing tasks.
So, in this scenario, how do companies stand out in finance?
Forbes CCO Randall Lane interviewed a panel on just this question. Rishi Nair of Diddo, David Cushman of HFS, and Orby CEO Bella Liu discussed how things are changing, and what strategies are likely to win the day.
Nair spoke on the value of personalizing services.
I think that … the reason that we love social media companies so much is because of the incredible personalization that each one of those companies has on ourselves,” he said. “I think that as personalization gets extrapolated into different companies, and we're able to have our own experiences, wherever we're interacting with technology, that's when you can start saying that this technology knows me, this technology is able to really get where I'm coming from, and having that sort of relationship with what I'm being able to use and where I'm going allows me to trust the technology a lot more. Personalization is trust, at the end of the day.”
Liu pointed out the necessity of the human in the loop, noting the fundamental flaws of fully autonomous solutions in finance.
“You have to have the human actually touch the process,” she said. “You cannot really have AI agents just go around autonomously and do the work.”
Later, Cushman addressed questions about the current trajectory of AI in the markets.
Companies, he noted, tend to get stuck in what he called “pilot purgatory,” unable to move toward full deployment and next steps.
“It's about between 5% and 12% that get out of that,” he said, “so we're talking about the firms that are actually making an impact with AI. I think of those, we're now going to see quite a significant uptick in their uptake of AI, because there's a small group of those firms, they tend to be firms that have already been through a significant scale (of) digital transformation, and … they trust firms that they've done those digital transformations with, and they're now ready to invest in the next (way).”
Balancing the ideas of trust and speed, the panel talked about how to bring solutions to market, how to develop projects, and ultimately, how to listen to users.
Liu tied the concept of risk mitigation to experiences she cited with users where the users want to “slow” the program down, in order to better understand its operations.
“When we work with AI, to infuse AI in some of the workflows, you enter data into a lot of different systems, and the AI actually can do a really good job, like sometimes even about 100% accuracy,” she said. “And you can (make) the AI agent run very fast, just to automate those soul-crushing data entry jobs for you.”
However, she noted, even though the speed is more efficient, in some contexts, users want it to run slower.
“In the user research, what we learn is that the users actually prefer you to slow down the AI agents, so they can exactly see how the AI is entering the data, step by step,” she said. “And they can follow along,  they feel that they can intervene when there's a potential for mistake, and then they are fully in control as a human. So the users actually are happier that way.”
“As long as there's an agentic flow to make the hairiness not suck as much as it does, that's where AI can be really useful,” Nair added. “I think using the AI agent after a human, or some human in the loop has said, ‘Yes, I want you to do this,’ or ‘yes, this is exactly how I want you to do this,’ and then that is done 100% … I think it's just the human in the loop that leads to trust.”
Watch the video for the rest, including how the panel, led by Lane, ponders how companies get “alpha” with products and services, leveraging AI to its potential. This is big stuff, and will determine how the AI rush shakes out among companies. When the panel discussed the likely position of incumbents, for example, some pointed out that although these traditional firms might not be as versatile or quick to innovate, they will have an edge in terms of the auspices of an industry. Liu pointed out how the incumbents will have the “domain experience,” and, often, a customer base.
So what are the moats? What will competitive development look like? This panel helped me to build a road map, when it comes to the impact of AI in these kinds of markets. Stay tuned for more."

Recent crypto market volatility, including the dramatic sell-off that occurred following announcements from the White House indicating renewed and enlarged trade tariffs between the U.S. and China has had significant implications for the crypto investing marketplace. Seasoned investors might be used to higher levels of volatility, but with the recent entrance of many TradFi players to space, a new batch of institutional and retail players alike are being exposed to how volatility can work to both the upside and downside. Debate and discourse have dominated headlines as to what specifically caused the recent dramatic sell-off in cryptoassets, but a few facts remain true.
Firstly, a trader using a smaller exchange (Hyperliquid) placed a large one-way bet on the market dropping substantially within minutes of the announcement coming from the White House that kicked off the market turmoil. While these remain allegations and suspicions at this time the facts remain that the size, timing, and one-way directionality of the position indicate higher-than-normal certainty for such a large unhedged position. Secondly, as larger institutions have developed and deployed crypto and other on-chain products and services, the risk tolerance of these newer investors may be lower than more veteran players, which might have compounded the sell-off. Lastly, is that large scale sell-offs do still trigger additional liquidations and margin calls, such as the issues that occurred at Binance during the sell-off, leading the firm to reimburse customers in excess of $400 million. 
Taking all of that into account, let’s also take a look at a few lessons and takeaways that crypto investors should understand as the market works through this most recent bout of volatility.
An initial appeal of cryptoassets, especially for institutional investors and professional traders, was that the asset class often moved in a counter-cyclical manner that provided a hedge against volatility in other market sectors. More recently however this dynamic has changed as bitcoin and other assets have become more firmly entrenched in the risk-on asset category. Specifically as geo-political headlines around tariffs and other such issues have caused risk-on assets (many stocks), crypto has reacted in a similar manner.
While not surprising – as more traditional investors and institutions have allocated capital to crypto it makes sense that trading patterns will begin to mirror the wider marketplace – it does change the investment thesis that has long underpinned the crypto sector. As cryptoassets, including but not limited to bitcoin itself, trade more closely in alignment with other sectors, investors and advocates alike will need to adjust.
Crypto becoming a risk-on asset is not a negative, but it is a change that investors need to build into models. 
Alongside the influx of institutional investment and interest that has piled into the crypto market since early 2024 there have been other developments. The rapid proliferation and growth of spot ETFs like those for bitcoin and ether – as well as the potential for dozens more once regulatory operations resume at full capacity – also ties into another important change. Hedging trades, investments, and market positions is a tried-and-true tool in the institutional toolbox, and unlike previous crypto bull markets the current one is dominated by those very same institutions. Retail investors, HODLers, or less experienced investors may not utilize these tools, but that is rapidly changing.
Following the flash crash put options for both bitcoin and ether – the two cryptocurrencies that still dominate the trading volume and dollar-value by a large degree – surged as investors sought to obtain protection against further downside. Algorithmic programs developed to monitor such activity took these moves as signs of further downside risk, further amplifying what already was a dramatic and widespread downturn. The very same hedging instruments that are used to protect against volatility and downside risk, in this case, led to increased liquidation of on-margin positions, which in turn pushed prices lower at an accelerated rate before stabilizing.
Institutions bring institutional trading tools, and the crypto market needs the maturity to process, digest, and analyze what these signals mean. 
An important, yet potentially painful lesson that crypto investors and advocates alike are beginning to learn is that – even with substantial policy progress and tailwinds permeating the marketplace, the success of crypto investments is not guaranteed. Even as TradFi institutions deploy products and services, states such as Wyoming launch state-backed tokens, and the U.S. federal government pivots to a pro-crypto position, market volatility and external forces can still wreak havoc on portfolios. Headlines are one thing, but market realities, leverage, algorithmic trades cascading upon one another, and risk appetite continue to dominate what happens in the day-to-day or the crypto sector.
Crypto is maturing, and with that maturity will come learning opportunities, some of which will be bumpier than others; investors and policymakers alike should view this positively.

Samsung and Apple, two of the world's leading smartphone manufacturers, believed that there was a big market for slim phones in 2025. The former beat its biggest rival to the market by launching the Galaxy S25 Edge earlier this year. 

It has only been a couple of months since Apple came out with the iPhone Air. However, it appears that the device isn't selling as well as the company might have hoped, a reality that Samsung is all too familiar with.

There have been reports since the Galaxy S25 Edge was released that the device isn't selling well, even as it was expected that the slim model would ultimately replace the “+” model in Samsung's flagship lineup. 

Perhaps the sales weren't good enough to justify making that significant change. It's now being reported that Samsung has cancelled the Galaxy S26 Edge altogether, meaning that this has the possibility of becoming a one-time device. 

Despite launching to much fan fair, it appears that the iPhone Air isn't selling that well either. Japan's Mizuho Securities has said in a note to investors that Apple is planning to cut the production of the iPhone Air.

It's not that people don't like Apple's new phones. The firm claims that both the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are seeing higher sales than last year's models, but the Air is lagging behind. Apple is now reportedly planning to cut the iPhone Air production by one million units this year.

Whether Apple goes the Samsung routes and kills the device entirely for next year remains to be seen, but it's clear that these rivals may have overestimated their customers' desire for phones that don't offer much else other than being very slim.

A well-followed pseudonymous analyst on X (known as Pentoshi) said Friday he started a small position in HYPE, Hyperliquid’s native token, and will add only if prices drift lower.
In his Oct. 17 post, he wrote that he “nibbled” on spot HYPE below $34, filling about 20% of the position he ultimately wants. Spot means he bought the token itself without leverage, which removes the risk of forced liquidations. He said he’d “load up” nearer $28 and “go hard” sub-$30, a scale in approach that spaces buys across levels instead of committing all capital at once.
The setup, he stressed, sits inside a broader downtrend. By “lower highs,” he means each rebound is failing beneath the prior peak — a classic bearish structure that often resolves with another leg down. When he says there’s “broken market structure,” he’s pointing to damaged support zones and thin order books after last week’s volatility, conditions that can exaggerate moves and produce whipsaws. The takeaway: keep size small, avoid trying to nail an exact bottom, and assume dips can overshoot.
Pentoshi also flagged a potential supply overhang from an unstaking queue. On networks that allow staking, previously locked tokens periodically unlock; if a chunk of those coins is sold rather than restaked, short-term sell pressure can rise. He said he doesn’t know whether a quarter, a third, or less will hit the market, so he’s leaving resting bids below current price and letting the market come to him instead of chasing strength.
He added that a recent ether trade that strayed from his rules “burnt” him a bit — even if a bounce helped — so he’s playing defense: smaller sizing, pre-set bids, and minimal micromanagement of this position in the near term.
Hyperliquid is a decentralized exchange that runs on its own chain and is used mainly for perpetual futures — derivatives with no expiry. Its token, HYPE, serves as both governance and economic stake: holders can vote on upgrades, stake for rewards, and benefit from mechanisms that link trading activity and fees to the token’s value. In short: Hyperliquid is the venue; HYPE is how users share in its growth.
According to CoinDesk Data, just prior to publish time, HYPE was around $36.32, up 2.1% in the past 24 hours.

When competition heats up, the first thing to remember is that most SaaS markets aren’t natural monopolies—they’re oligopolies. That means you’re not going to kill your competitors, and they’re not going to kill you, unless you let them.  But product-market fit isn’t static.
Are You Getting More Competitive, Or Less Competitive?  Just Hitting the Plan Might Not Be Enough

Your existing customers are your best defense and offense. If they’re happy, they won’t churn, even if your competitors have a better product. Get on a plane, visit your top customers, and show them love. Host customer dinners, conferences, or anything that builds loyalty and community. Happy customers will not only stick around but also advocate for you, which is invaluable when the market gets crowded.
If you’re losing deals because of specific feature gaps, don’t panic. Be analytical. Build what you need to close those gaps step-by-step. Communicate clearly with prospects about what’s coming and when. Some will wait for you, and others will believe in your roadmap. This won’t double your growth overnight, but it will improve your win rates over time.
What’s the one thing you can do that’s 10x better than your competitors? At EchoSign, we won deals early on because we were the only cross-platform e-signature solution, and later because of our ease of use and localization. These features gave us a competitive edge for years while others played catch-up. What’s your equivalent? If you don’t have one, build it.
The 10x Feature is Real.  At Least, for a While.  What’s Yours?

You might not want to hear this, but it’s often is the end the only real answer.   If your competitors are pushing hard, you need to push harder. That might mean squeezing out an extra 10-20% growth by remixing your team, optimizing processes, or just plain hustling.  And moving on from execs and team members that don’t want to.  It’s painful, but it can make a huge difference in the long run. Over five years, growing at 100% YoY instead of 85% can mean doubling your business.
Don’t let the competition distract you. Focus on your strengths, your customers, and your roadmap. Most companies lose because they panic, not because they’re out-competed. Stay focused, stay calm, and execute relentlessly.

98,2025-10-18,"ByMichael Foster,
Contributor.
I’m regularly struck by something American investors always seem to take for granted: The many choices we have available to gain financial independence.
And investors in closed-end funds (CEFs) make the most of these choices. These high-yielding funds kick out 8%+ dividends on average, and the portfolio of my CEF Insider service, which helps investors make the most of CEFs, pays even more, with its 18 holdings paying a rich average yield of 9.4%.
Plus, these funds offer stock-like upside, which makes them pretty much tailor-made for delivering financial freedom.
We’ll sketch out how two specific CEFs can help you find your way to an earlier, richer retirement in a bit. But first, back to that embarrassment of choices I mentioned a second ago.
Back in my 20s, when I was studying to get my PhD in Europe, I was told I had to pay into the national pension fund, and I would get that money back when I qualified for it. At that time, I qualified at 62, which seemed absurd—nearly 40 years for me (a severely underpaid academic!) to get back money I desperately needed today.
But as it turns out, I was lucky.
Europe’s mandatory retirement age is rising. Denmark, which currently has the oldest retirement age in Europe at 67, is raising that to 70. Germany, where a normal retirement age is currently 66, is discussing raising that to 73.
Whether you like the life of a worker or not, I’m almost certain that you like having the ability to choose that life without having to worry about governments changing the rules on you mid-game.
This lack of choice pushed me away from Europe in my 20s and led me back to America. Here’s what I found when I returned.
This chart shows that the average American household has gone from $200k in savings in the 1980s to $1.2 million now—and, no, that isn’t due to inflation. That $200k in savings would be $535k in 2025 dollars, so more than half of the jump to $1.2 million is due to actual value being created.
Of course, that wealth isn’t going everywhere. While all households have gotten richer on average, the top 0.1% of the population is attracting a greater proportion of overall wealth in the US, now near 14%.
The ethics of this aside, it’s clear that the households that have more wealth now have more choices—about when to retire, where to live, what lifestyle to adopt and so on.
In a way, it seems like Europeans have too little choice and Americans have so much that retirement investing can be tough for individual investors to navigate without either taking undue risks or locking themselves into weak returns.
This is where CEFs come in, with their focus on assets from well-established companies. Plus their high yields almost act like a “mini-pension,” boosting your income without leaving you at the whim of the government.
This is the way I viewed CEFs in my late 20s, when I began using their high dividends to get the income I needed to make the choices I wanted. I still view them this way.
And in addition to their big dividends, these funds often chalk up strong returns, too, thanks in large part to their discounts to net asset value (NAV, or the value of their underlying portfolios). As these discounts—which only apply to CEFs, by the way—shrink, they put upward pressure on the fund’s price.
And the best part is that CEFs are easy to buy, trading on public markets just like stocks.
Consider the first CEF we’re looking at today, the Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX). It’s one of the oldest funds in the world, tracing its history back to the 19th century (and is a current CEF Insider holding, too).
This one is about as blue chip as it gets, with stocks like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon.com (AMZN) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) among its top holdings.
What’s more—and this is the key part—ADX trades at an 8.3% discount to NAV as I write this, and that discount is in the sweet spot, cheaper than it was a few months ago but carrying momentum as it steams toward par.
ADX has been paying dividends since before the Great Depression, and its 8.3% dividend yield is fully covered by the 13.3% total NAV return (or the return on its underlying portfolio) it’s enjoyed over the last decade. Moreover, ADX has delivered a 5,340% return to its shareholders, with dividends reinvested, since the late 1980s, when US household wealth just started to meaningfully tick higher.
That kind of performance—coming our way at a discount and with an 8.3% dividend—is exactly what we want from our “mini-pension,” and ADX delivers.
But, as I said, we do have choices here. And ADX isn’t the only US-stock-focused CEF that delivers a large income stream and has withstood the test of time.
Another is the General American Investors Company (GAM), which was launched in 1927 and yielded an impressive 9.4% to investors in 2024. GAM also holds large caps, with Alphabet (GOOGL), Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) and Apple (AAPL) among its top holdings.
And, like ADX, this fund’s market price–based return has been strong over the last decade—though not quite as strong as ADX—with a 14.4% annualized return.
Moreover, GAM’s 9.3% discount sounds like a good deal, but that’s near its smallest-ever level, so we’re not rushing out to buy the fund today. But it is worth watching, and gets tempting when that discount drops to double digits.
But the larger point remains: With high-yielding CEFs like these, we can start generating a meaningful income stream we can choose to use however we like.
