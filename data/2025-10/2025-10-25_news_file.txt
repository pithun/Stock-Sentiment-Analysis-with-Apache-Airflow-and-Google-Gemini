0,2025-10-25,"A few minutes into using ChatGPT Atlas, the new internet browser from OpenAI, I ran into quite a big road block.
This isn't like Google Chrome, which is used by roughly 60% of people. It's all built around a chatbot you're meant to talk to to surf the web.
""Messages limit reached,"" read one note. ""No available models support the tools in use,"" said another.
And then: ""You've hit the free plan limit for GPT-5.""
OpenAI says it will make using the internet easier and more efficient. A step closer to ""a true super-assistant"".
But assistants, super or not, don't come free - and the company needs to start making a lot more money from its 800 million users.
OpenAI says Atlas offers us an opportunity to ""rethink what it means to use the web"".
It looks somewhat similar to Chrome or Apple's Safari to begin with, apart from the big difference - a sidebar chatbot.
On a train booking website, it offered to ""highlight deals"" or compare prices with other places.
I asked it to book me a train, but was told this is only available for paying ChatGPT customers.
Later, I tried something simpler: I asked it to take me to an article I was reading the other day, but couldn't quite remember what website it was on.
These are early days, but there's potential for big changes in how we use the internet.
What's clear is this will be a premium product which will only work to its full capacity if you pay a subscription fee.
Given we are so used to browsing the internet for free, this would require a lot of people to alter their habits quite dramatically.
OpenAI's founding mission was to reach artificial general intelligence - roughly meaning an AI which can match human intelligence.
So how does a browser help with that mission?
It doesn't, really. But it could raise some revenue.
The firm has convinced venture capitalists and investors to back it with billions of dollars - and at some point, it needs to start showing a return on that investment.
In other words, it needs to make money. 
But raising money the internet's traditional way - advertising - might be a risk.
""OpenAI may be tempted to show ads to recoup costs and turn a profit, but it also must deliver a good user experience to stand out in a competitive market,"" said Stephanie Liu, a senior analyst at Forrester.
OpenAI will be hoping its users will find it so good they are willing to start paying - but only about 5% of ChatGPT users pay for a subscription, according to the Financial Times.
The other thing Atlas could do is give the firm access to a huge amount of user data.
These kinds of AI tools are ultimately about scale - the more data you feed them, the thinking goes, the better they will become.
The web is designed for humans to use, so if Atlas can monitor us - how we book train tickets for example - it can learn how to better navigate these kinds of processes.
""It remains to be seen how OpenAI will use users' data from Atlas, but for users who prefer anonymity and privacy, the browser may be too great of a risk,"" said Ms Liu.
Then we get to the competition.
Google Chrome is so dominant, authorities around the world have started raising eyebrows and words like ""monopoly"" are being thrown around.
It won't be easy to muscle into that market.
Google's Gemini AI is a part of the search engine now, while Microsoft has added Copilot into its Edge browser.
Back in the early days of ChatGPT, some dubbed it the ""Google killer"" - a game-changer which would make online search as we know it redundant.
That's not happened yet. But Erik Goins, founder of app developer Flywheel Studios, thinks it could.
He said Google built its business on ""being the middleman between users and websites"", whereas ChatGPT is ""eliminating the middleman entirely"".
""You don't search for 'hotels in Miami' and click through Google results anymore,"" he said.
""You just ask ChatGPT and it connects you directly.""
Whether enough people are willing to pay for that little bit of extra convenience remains to be seen - and there's a long way to go before Google is toppled.

1,2025-10-25,"Right now, there are robots stocking convenience store shelves in Japan. We haven't embraced that tech here in America yet, but it's hard to imagine 7-11 or Walmart won't at least experiment with it soon. Walmart gave up on its shelf-scanning robots in 2020, …"
2,2025-10-25,"There is a place in Sudan where it is almost possible to forget that a devastating civil war is going on.
Wrapped in bright colours and wearing plastic sandals, women in the country's Jebel Marra mountains set off each morning on donkeys, children in tow, to tend the fields.
In a Mediterranean-like climate and using the fertile soil, they grow peanuts, oranges, apples and strawberries - rare crops for a country now facing one of the world's worst hunger crises. Before the conflict, Jebel Marra's organic oranges were particularly prized across the country for their juiciness.
The mountainous area in this part of the western Darfur region is dotted with green peaks, especially now as it is the rainy season.
The rest of Sudan teeters on the edge of disaster.
Across the country, as a result of the two-and-a-half years of fighting that has crippled agriculture, almost 25 million people - half the population - are facing severe food shortages, including more than 600,000 who are experiencing famine, according to the UN.
But in the lush highlands of Jebel Marra, the problem is not growing food – it is getting the produce out.
""We almost sell them for free and sometimes get rid of them on the way [to market], because they get rotten,"" says Hafiz Ali, an orange vendor in Golo town, which is in the midst of the mountains in Central Darfur state.
The insecurity and the poor state of the roads make transportation almost impossible.
Jebel Marra is the last remaining territory controlled by the Sudan Liberation Army - Abdulwahid (SLA-AW). This armed group has remained neutral in the current war. It has never signed a peace deal with the authorities in Khartoum going back to 2003 and the conflict over Darfur at that time.
SLA-AW has controlled what locals describe as ""liberated areas"" for more than two decades.
Now, surrounded by war on all sides, the region is increasingly isolated.
To the west and north, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and allied Arab militias have blocked major roads. To the south, RSF positions are bombed almost every week by the Sudanese army - these attacks are also claiming civilian lives.
The RSF also control areas to the east.
The result is a closed-off environment where farmers and middlemen can no longer reach the national markets in the cities of el-Fasher 130km (82 miles) away, or Tine, on the Chadian border, 275km (170 miles) away.
There are other alternatives but none have the same national reach and all involve treacherous journeys.
Tawila, right on the edge of SLA-AW territory, has become the site of a makeshift market. It is on the road to el-Fasher, which is cut off by an RSF siege, and has become home to tens of thousands who have managed to flee that city.
Because of the difficulty of moving the produce any further, there is an oversupply in the market and as a result prices here have fallen.
There are some here who are looking to buy supplies to try and smuggle produce into el-Fasher - an extremely dangerous and life-threatening trade.
Getting goods this far has always been a challenge and food can sometimes rot on the way.
""To travel about 12km, it takes you a whole day of driving in the mountains and the mud,"" says Yousif, a fruit vendor in Tawila. But now, he says, the insecurity makes things even worse.
In Central Darfur, a recent truce between leaders from the Fur ethnic group - dominant here - and Arab nomads has allowed limited trade in some areas.
Markets have reopened in the SLA-AW- controlled town of Nertiti, where Arab women sell sour milk and Fur farmers bring fruit and vegetables. But the arrangement is fragile.
""The market only opens once a week. Travel is still dangerous,"" says a trader from Nertiti.
""Armed robberies still happen on the roads, even after the agreement.""
Fruit and crops can now also be sold in the market in RSF-controlled Zalingei, the capital of Central Darfur state. But Arab militias allied to the RSF are frequently accused of harassing or attacking civilians in the area, though the groups deny any wrongdoing.
Each Thursday, which is market day, the number of checkpoints between Nertiti and Zalingei increases, sometimes reaching more than two dozen. But as more vehicles are on the road on market days, more people take the opportunity to travel.
The checkpoints, some manned by RSF fighters and others by Arab militia, are sometimes overseen by just one armed man in plainclothes, who demands a fee. Drivers will then often try to negotiate as passengers watch on silently.
Returning back to the Jebel Marra region, SLA-AW checkpoints guard every road into the mountains, and armed men also demand money.
Bags are searched with contraband, even including skin-bleaching creams, widely used elsewhere in Sudan, are confiscated.
Once inside the SLA-AW controlled area, despite the relative peace, there are clear signs of the conflict elsewhere in the country.
Lorries filled with people fleeing the fighting, particularly around el-Fasher, can be seen on a daily basis.
Many of them find shelter in schools, clinics and other public spaces receiving little to no humanitarian assistance - aid agencies struggle to get through all the checkpoints.
In Golo, the de facto capital of the SLA-AW territory, a woman who had escaped from el-Fasher, described the dire conditions. She is now sheltering in a classroom with 25 other freshly arrived families.
""We have no income. No jobs to do, I used to work as a nurse and I can farm, but the land here belongs to people who work only for themselves. We don't know what to do,"" the woman said.
As she spoke, sick, elderly people lay on the ground and children were screaming from hunger. At least there will be some relief as the food that could not be taken out of Golo will be available.
This is the Jebel Marra region, a strange world surrounded by war. A world of green mountains and waterfalls. A world of bright, juicy fruit. A world of frightened evacuees.
One fruit trader said he had lost hope in both warring parties.
""We're not part of the war - we just want to sell our oranges.""

The frontrunner of the New York City mayoral race has big plans ahead.
Zohran Mamdani's meteoric rise as the Democratic candidate is not just fueled by his social media prowess. It is also spearheaded by his plans to provide universal childcare, make buses free, freeze the rent for rent-stabilized units, build more affordable housing, and create a pilot program experimenting with city-operated grocery stores.
His key plans would be funded by a proposed 11.5% increase in state corporate tax, which is estimated to bring in new annual revenue of $5 billion, as well $4 billion in income from a proposed 2% increase in income tax for NYC residents who make more than $1 million a year. Both plans would need the approval of the state legislature.
Mamdani has also proposed increasing the efficiency of city contracts and hiring more auditors to enforce the tax code, which his campaign estimates would bring an additional billion in revenue.
Affordability became a national focus in recent years due to pandemic-era inflation. Two new polls conducted in October by Lake Research Partners, a progressive polling firm, indicate that measures to boost affordability, such as raising the minimum wage, are popular across competitive swing districts and major cities.
Here is a look at Mamdani's key plans for NYC and how much they will cost, as he faces off independent candidate Andrew Cuomo and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa on Election Day on November 4.
Expanding free childcare to babies and to toddlers under the age of three is Mamdani's most ambitious and costly plan.
NYC already offers free pre-school to many toddlers above three, but for parents with even younger kids, accessing childcare is a struggle. According to the New York Comptroller's Office, annual average childcare prices for one child in New York in 2023 were about $12,000 for home-based care, $17,476 for toddler center-based care, and $20,459 for infant center-based care. A 2024 report by public policy think tank 5BORO Institute found that more than 80% of families cannot afford day care for their children.
The Mamdani campaign estimates that providing childcare to all NYC families could cost $6 billion annually. The plan would be funded by the proposed tax raise on corporations and the wealthiest residents, and the campaign said it would also generate revenue through expanding the labor force. According to a January report from the NYC Comptroller, expanding free childcare would bring 14,000 mothers to the workforce and generate $900 million in labor income.
NYC has one of the highest densities of public transit users in the country, yet the city's buses only average a speed of eight miles per hour, and Mamdani wants to change that.
Mamdani proposed that buses be completely free to the more than a million riders every day, who are mostly commuters for work purposes. 
He also plans to create more busways that are limited to other through traffic to speed up the transit. 
The city currently provides a 50% discount on public transit fares for low-income residents, but fare evasion has remained at around 40% every quarter since 2024. Mamdani's campaign estimates that free buses would cost under $800 million every year. 
This estimate does not factor in Mamdani's plan to build more bus-only lanes.
Last summer, a city lottery opened for the first time in 15 years for NYC residents to get help paying their rent, and more than 630,000 people applied to get on the waitlist. The application only remained open for one week, but the need for affordable housing was on full display.
Mamdani plans to address the housing issue by tripling the city's production of publicly subsidized, rent-stabilized homes, at 200,000 new units over the next 10 years. The plan would benefit households that make less than $70,000 a year, and it would cost the city $100 billion over the next decade.
Separate from the plan to build, Mamdani plans to freeze rent for the one million rent-stabilized units across the city, which could be achieved with relative ease and comes at zero direct cost to the city's budget. This rent freeze would only affect rent-stabilized units, which make up a little under half of the city's rental stock, and would not apply to market-rate units.
If elected, Mamdani as mayor could appoint members to the Rent Guidelines Board who align with his affordability goals.
The plan could draw the ire of building owners who would need to shoulder more costs in maintenance and property taxes.
Mamdani has also suggested a pilot program of five city-run supermarkets, one in each borough, to bring down the cost of groceries. The program would require approval from the city council, and these grocery stores would be selling food at wholesale prices.
According to the NY State Comptroller's Office, the cost of food at home grew 65.8% between 2013 and 2023 in NYC, which far outpaces the rate of broader inflation.
Including cost of rent, utilities, warehouse, property taxes, and the initial cost to stock up goods, the Mamdani campaign estimates that the five stores would cost $60 million annually.
Chicago's mayor, Brandon Johnson, is also pushing forward a similar idea. According to a feasibility study done in 2024, building three stores would cost the city $26.7 million upfront.

Home » What to Buy
Hybrid sedans are a great buy in today’s hybrid car market. They often lead the entire hybrid market in fuel efficiency, while having some of the lowest prices amongst all hybrid vehicles. They also make for great commuter cars, everyday drivers, and family vehicles.
This article explores the most affordable and fuel-efficient sedans on the market today. We will examine both standard hybrid sedans and affordable plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). Note that some sedans on this list appear twice — once for the standard hybrid sedan and once for the PHEV version. For each sedan, we will provide some key statistics on mileage and fuel savings, allowing you to make informed decisions about purchasing these vehicles.
We have ordered this list from the least expensive to the most expensive manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP). All of the MSRPs on this list are below $45,000, making them within affordable reach for most new car buyers. We also examined the fuel efficiency and EPA-estimated gas savings of the hybrid sedan compared to the standard non-hybrid model. If there was no non-hybrid model for comparison, we compared the hybrid sedan with the average 2024 vehicle’s 28 miles per gallon (mpg), per the EPA’s Average Annual Fuel Savings data.
Lastly, we looked at each vehicle’s overall value and utility with details about the car’s passenger room, trunk room, and performance on the road. All of the vehicle information comes from the manufacturers’ websites.
The 2025 Toyota Corolla Hybrid gets 53 mpg in the city, 46 mpg on the highway, and 50 mpg combined. By comparison, the non-hybrid Corolla gets 35 mpg combined. The EPA-estimated annual fuel savings over the non-hybrid Corolla is $417 per year, or $35 in gas savings per month.
With its 50 mpg combined, the Toyota Corolla Hybrid makes for a great commuting car or daily driver. Words like practical, efficient, and reliable come to mind when discussing this gas-sipper. The 5-seat sedan has good legroom in both rows and can comfortably fit two adults in the back seat. The trunk space has a reasonable 13.1 cubic feet of cargo room.
The 2025 Hyundai Elantra Blue Hybrid Sedan gets 51 mpg in the city, 58 mpg on the highway, and 54 mpg combined. By comparison, the non-hybrid Elantra gets 36 mpg combined. The EPA-estimated annual fuel savings over the non-hybrid Elantra is $450 per year, or $38 in gas savings per month.
When it comes to gas mileage, the Hyundai Elantra Hybrid’s Blue trim ranks only behind the Toyota Prius models on this list. The Elantra boasts generous passenger room, with ample legroom in the back seats. The Elantra’s trunk space offers 14.2 cubic feet of space.
The 2025 Toyota Prius Hybrid gets 57 mpg in the city, 56 mpg on the highway, and 57 mpg combined. There is no non-hybrid Prius to compare. The EPA-estimated annual fuel savings compared to the average 2024 vehicle is $883 per year, or $74 in gas savings per month.
The Toyota Prius is considered the king of the hybrids, and for good reason. Its 57 mpg combined rating is only topped by its PHEV sibling on this list. With its sleek design and quick acceleration, the 2025 Prius is also fun to drive. The Prius provides good passenger room with the exception of headroom in the back seat, which is a little short. Cargo room in the Prius measures 23.8 cubic feet behind the rear seats — impressive for its segment.
The 2025 FWD Toyota Camry LE Hybrid Sedan gets 53 mpg in the city, 50 mpg on the highway, and 51 mpg combined. There is no non-hybrid Camry to compare. The EPA-estimated annual fuel savings compared to the average 2024 vehicle is $783 per year, or $66 in gas savings per month.
The hybrid-only 2025 Toyota Camry comes with a more powerful hybrid powertrain and great fuel efficiency, making it an excellent choice for city driving or a daily commute. Its spacious interior provides ample head and legroom in the front and rear seats. Its trunk space measures 15.1 cubic feet, enough to handle a large grocery run or hold luggage for a weekend getaway.
The 2025 Honda Civic Hybrid Sedan gets 50 mpg in the city, 47 mpg on the highway, and 49 mpg combined. By comparison, the non-hybrid Civic gets 36 mpg combined. The EPA-estimated annual fuel savings over the non-hybrid Civic is $358 per year, or $30 in gas savings per month.
Named the 2025 North American Car of the Year, the Honda Civic Hybrid balances practicality and fuel efficiency with a more powerful hybrid powertrain with 200 horsepower. The Civic offers good passenger space with plenty of legroom in the rear seats. Cargo room is also good for this segment, with 14.8 cubic feet of space in the trunk.
The 2025 Hyundai Sonata SEL Hybrid Sedan gets 44 mpg in the city, 51 mpg on the highway, and 47 mpg combined. By comparison, the non-hybrid Sonata gets 32 mpg combined. The EPA-estimated annual fuel savings over the non-hybrid Sonata is $485 per year, or $41 in gas savings per month.
The Hyundai Sonata midsize sedan offers great mileage, ample passenger room, and a smooth, composed ride, making it a good choice for a family sedan. The Sonata has a spacious, 5-seat interior with an upscale feel. There is ample legroom in both the front and rear seats. The trunk space is also generous, offering 16 cubic feet of storage.
The 2025 Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid gets 127 MPGe combined. It has an all-electric range of 45 miles and a total range of 600 miles. EPA-estimated annual fuel savings compared to the average 2024 vehicle is $1050 per year, or $88 in gas savings per month.
Like its standard hybrid sibling (also on this list), the Prius PHEV has a stylish, sleek look and is fun to drive. However, it has two things the standard hybrid Prius lacks — a 45-mile all-electric range and a more robust hybrid powertrain with an impressive combined 220 horsepower. Like its standard hybrid sibling, the Prius PHEV has good passenger legroom, but headroom in the rear seats is a little cramped. The PHEV’s cargo room is slightly less than the standard hybrid Prius, measuring 20.3 cubic feet behind the rear seats.
The 2025 Honda Accord Sport Hybrid Sedan gets 46 mpg in the city, 41 mpg on the highway, and 44 mpg combined. By comparison, the non-hybrid Accord gets 32 mpg combined. The EPA-estimated annual fuel savings over the non-hybrid Accord is $414 per year, or $35 in gas savings per month.
The Honda Accord Sport Hybrid midsize sedan is the perfect mix of practicality, comfort, performance, and value, making it a great choice for a family sedan. It offers a spacious interior with generous legroom in the front and rear seats for five adults. Cargo space is also generous — trunk room measures 16.7 cubic feet, enough to handle luggage for a week-long road trip.
The 2025 all-wheel drive (AWD) Toyota Crown Hybrid Sedan gets 42 mpg in the city, 41 mpg on the highway, and 41 mpg combined. There is no non-hybrid Crown to compare. The EPA-estimated annual fuel savings compared to the average 2024 vehicle is $550 per year, or $46 in gas savings per month.
If you’re looking for a higher-end sedan with good mileage, power, and a hint of luxury, then the hybrid-only Toyota Crown is a good choice. Bigger than the typical midsize sedan, the Crown has a taller, almost SUV-like profile. It offers abundant passenger space with good head and legroom in the rear seats. The Crown’s trunk has 15.2 cubic feet of space.
The 2025 Lexus ES 300h Hybrid Sedan gets 43 mpg in the city, 44 mpg on the highway, and 44 mpg combined. By comparison, the non-hybrid ES gets 25 mpg combined. The EPA-estimated annual fuel savings over the non-hybrid ES is $839 per year, or $70 in gas savings per month.
Luxury comes first with the Lexus ES Hybrid, with its comfortable interior and quiet, smooth ride. But fuel efficiency is not far behind, with the luxury hybrid sedan offering 44 mpg combined and great fuel savings over its non-hybrid sibling. The ES’s plush interior is spacious, with ample legroom in the rear seats to relax and stretch out. Cargo capacity is adequate, with 13.9 cubic feet of space in the trunk.
All the hybrid and plug-in hybrid sedans on this list offer good value due to their competitive prices, fuel savings, and utility. Eight of the sedans on this list have an MSRP of less than $35,000, making them highly affordable. Add to that their considerable gas savings over their non-hybrid counterparts, and you have what amounts to great value.
Use this list as a starting point to search for an affordable hybrid sedan in today’s market. Specifically, use the mileage and fuel savings numbers provided here to pencil out whether buying the hybrid or PHEV version of the vehicle is the right choice for you. We hope you find the value you are looking for!

Data centers are being built with unprecedented gusto all over the U.S. The reason for this is fairly well known: the AI business requires gargantuan amounts of electricity and computing power. Every time you use an app like DALL-E to, say, make one of those dumb AI-generated images of Mickey Mouse committing the 9/11 terrorist attacks, you’re apparently using as much energy as it takes to charge an iPhone. Now picture how much electricity is being used if millions of Americans do it at the same time.
The Trump administration has made it known that it’s a friend to the AI industry (it recently launched the AI infrastructure initiative Stargate) and so, it makes perfect sense that its Energy Secretary, Chris Wright, has decided to cut the red tape when it comes to hooking data centers up to the electrical grid.
In a statement published Friday, the Energy Department announced its plan to amend current rules to allow organizations that consume a lot of electricity to connect to the grid much faster: “U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright directed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) today to initiate rulemaking procedures with a proposed rule to rapidly accelerate the interconnection of large loads, including data centers, positioning the United States to lead in AI innovation and in the revitalization of domestic manufacturing.”
Hear that, guys? Chris Wright is apparently such a big fan of large loads that, in a bout of deregulatory fervor, he’s now helping to usher in a new era of easier data center connection. While the specifics of Wright’s proposed rule are a little bit complicated, the obvious takeaway seems to be an effort to make the regulatory process less onerous on people who want to hook up a lot of servers to the grid. The Register notes that one proposed rule is to “limit the time taken to review connection decisions to 60 days,” ostensibly so applicants don’t get bogged down in a lengthy review process. In a letter about the proposed rule change published to the government’s website, Wright wrote:
“To usher in a new era of American prosperity, we must ensure all Americans and domestic industries have access to affordable, reliable, and secure electricity. To do this, large loads, including AI data centers, served by public utilities must be able to connect to the transmission system in a timely, orderly, and non-discriminatory manner. This is an urgent issue that requires prompt attention.”
He added:
“This Administration is committed to revitalizing domestic manufacturing/ and driving American AI innovation.’ both of which will require unprecedented and extraordinary quantities of electricity and substantial investment in the Nation’s interstate transmission system. We must do so efficiently, fairly, and expeditiously.”
The data center industry is booming, and, despite all that “bubble” talk when it comes to the AI business, it shows no signs of slowing down. Companies like Nebiusâwhich most of us had never heard of twelve months agoâare in the process of making themselves essential to large parts of the digital economy. Nebius, which is an AI infrastructure provider (it operates data centers), recently netted a deal with Microsoft, and went in on a robotaxi firm with Uber. Its stock price has also erupted some 350 percent this year, so, suffice to sayâfor the momentâit really pays to have a lot of servers.

Anish Pathipati spent years honing his skills as a private equity investor, and now, he's decided to ""hang out a shingle,"" launching his own fund, Simha Partners.
The last time we spoke to Pathipati for our 2018 Wall Street Rising Stars series, he was a director at North Island, a private equity firm founded by Glenn Hutchins, a cofounder of Silver Lake. He then joined Periphas Capital, cofounded by Sanjeev Mehra, a cofounder of Goldman Sachs' private investment arm.
He's applying what he's learned from these renowned investors to inform his plan for Simha Partners, which raised $45 million for its first fund earlier this month, Pathipati said, adding that it was oversubscribed. He's also trying something different, investing all of the capital in the fund to build a single business in a single sector: tire and auto repair.
Unlike search funders who look to buy a blue-collar business after working in corporate or investment roles, Pathipati will have plenty of help from his two other partners: Pathipati's father, Narendra ""Pat"" Pathipati, and another close family friend, Tim O'Day,
O'Day and the senior Pathipati rose to CEO and CFO of Boyd Group Services, the parent company of auto collision market leader Gerber Collision & Glass. From when O'Day became president of US operations for Gerber Collision & Glass in September 2008 to when he retired over the spring, Boyd's stock price had grown 100 times.
O'Day and the elder Pathipati, who retired as CFO in 2022, have decades of experience growing an auto collision business. And now, with the help of the younger Pathipati's technology investing expertise, Simha Partners will look to replicate that success in the tire and auto repair business.
Pathipati spoke to us about the impetus for Simha Partners' strategy, how it compares to the growing trend of search funds, how his career led up to this, and what it's like to work with your dad.
The following conversation has been edited for clarity and length.
I knew from day one that I wanted to be an entrepreneur, and I got closer to that goal at each phase of my career journey.
Phase one was institutional training at a mega-cap firm, Silver Lake Partners. Phase two was what I call my apprenticeship, working closely with legendary investors in startup settings. Phase three is now underway with the launch of Simha Partners, where I become the captain of my own journey.
In phase one, my approach was to work as hard as possible at this best-in-class institution. Working on transactions like the take-private of Dell helped me quickly pick up the tools of the investing trade.
In the apprenticeship phase, the key to success was choosing to work with people I had great regard for and who I could learn from.
This third phase requires a different mindset from the first two phases. Instead of trying to replicate what others have done, we want to build something new. In an industry that's 40 years old, how can we innovate?
This story is part of a new series catching up with finance pros we once spotlighted as Rising Stars of Wall Street to see where their careers have taken them. See our 2025 list here.
I call it our modern-day industrialist vision. The goal is not to have 15 or 20 different portfolio companies, like a traditional private equity firm, but to instead focus on building one platform, standing it up on its own two feet with a self-sufficient management team, and then doing the same for platform two or platform three.
To help accomplish this, I'm joined by two partners with a more operational background.
They've grown an exceptional business with a roll-up strategy, implementing an acquisition, integration, and operations excellence program that Tim and Pat helped develop.
Few private equity firms have partners with this type of operating track record, and especially not in the lower middle market, which is where we hope to begin.
With our first fund, we will focus exclusively on the tire and auto services industry. This shows target companies that we're not just tourists in the industry, and allows us to focus our attention on one industry, as opposed to a typical PE partner who is pulled in a lot of different directions.
While building the Simha vision, I did ask how we're different from a search fund. One key difference is that our capital is fully committed, unlike a search fund that has to go back to its investors. This allows us to present ourselves very differently to target companies.
A second difference is scale. With $45 million of commitments and a multiple of that available via co-invest demand, our fund is much larger than a typical search fund.
Third, we're not planning to run the company ourselves as CEOs. Search fund entrepreneurs are effectively buying a job, but we want to support a management team that can stand on its own.
The best competitive advantage comes from interweaving tech with real-world operations. The tire and auto services industry is ripe for the application of technology in operations. This cuts across every part of the business, from customer-facing workflows like scheduling and vehicle inspections to internal workflows like technician staffing and tire ordering.
Technology can't replace an auto mechanic, but it can allow the mechanics to serve customers faster, cheaper, and better.
It's really a dream come true. My dad has always been my closest mentor and greatest advocate — the opportunity to work with him is special. If anything though, it's made me work even harder. No time is off limits when your dad is your partner.
I'm also very excited about the opportunity to work with Tim. I've known him for over a decade and in addition to being an exceptional executive, I consider him a family friend.
It's been quite valuable for our business too, because many of the targets we would think about investing in are themselves family businesses. We can actually walk the walk, not just talk the talk, right? We can tell our targets that we have the capital of a private equity firm, the focus of a business builder, and top-tier operational experience, but it's one family and family-friend talking to another.""

    The new Chevrolet Bolt is cheaper than other ""affordable"" EVs, and even fixes the weaknesses of its predecessor.
  
This is what the 2027 Chevrolet Bolt would look like in your driveway. It's not a bad-looking car for less than $30,000.
Chevrolet's new Bolt feels like the kind of electric car the market has been waiting for -- an EV that's genuinely affordable but doesn't make major compromises. Starting at $28,995, it brings electric driving back into reach for regular buyers. 
But it's not just about the price: the second-generation Bolt looks to fix the weaknesses of its predecessor while doubling down on practicality and smart technology, aiming to appeal to drivers who want something efficient and approachable without paying top prices. It's worth noting that Tesla's new affordable models start at almost $10,000 more. 
The Chevy Bolt also launches at a time when shoppers of electric vehicle will be looking for cheaper options. According to June figures from Kelley Blue Book, the average new vehicle transaction price in the US sits at $48,644. That's 2% lower than the market peak in December 2023, but it's still about 13% more than prices in June 2021.

An up close and personal look at the 2027 Chevrolet Bolt in this striking blue color.
This car is impressive for a sub-$30,000 EV. Its power comes from a 65-kilowatt-hour lithium-iron-phosphate battery pack, which Chevrolet says is good for 255 miles on a full charge. That's a modest boost over the last Bolt EV and enough for most daily use, especially when paired with charging that's now genuinely fast -- up to 150 kilowatts, with a top-up from 10% to 80% in just 26 minutes. 
Chevrolet includes a CCS adapter for older chargers, and there's a native NACS port, meaning Tesla Supercharger access is built in from Day 1. The Bolt's new bidirectional charging setup allows it to output up to 9.6 kilowatts of power, letting owners feed electricity back into their homes during outages or peak hours. 
Performance should feel lively, too. The front-wheel-drive setup puts out 210 horsepower, while regenerative braking can be adjusted between low, high or blended modes for a more tailored feel behind the wheel. The Bolt still leans on practicality, offering 16 cubic feet of cargo space with the rear seats up and up to 57 cubic feet when folded. That makes it a good fit for small families or city drivers who occasionally need more room (though an SUV it most certainly is not). 
Inside, Chevrolet has modernized the experience with an 11.3-inch touchscreen and an 11-inch digital gauge cluster. The big omission is Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, which GM has decided to drop in favor of a native infotainment system with built-in connectivity. A 2023 McKinsey study revealed that roughly 50% of car buyers in the US would not consider a car without Apple CarPlay -- so this feels like a big miss from General Motors. 
Optional Super Cruise hands-free driving brings semi-autonomous highway capability, including lane changes, route following and automatic merging between interchanges. These features were once reserved for much more expensive EVs, but are now appearing in more affordable vehicles -- a win for car shoppers. 
Chevrolet is offering the car in three trims: The base LT at $28,995, an LT Comfort at $29,990 and the sportier RS trim for about $32,000. Deliveries will begin in the US in early 2026, with all models built at GM's Fairfax, Kansas, plant. At a time when many electric cars still cost well north of $40,000, this one might just prove that the affordable EV isn't dead after all.

    Apple is likely in the process of choosing someone to fill the chief executive role once Tim Cook decides to retire. Here are a few potential candidates that reports say are being considered.
  
Apple CEO Tim Cook visited Apple's Fifth Avenue store in New York in September 2025.
Tim Cook's 65th birthday is next week, on Nov. 1. And with the Apple CEO's special day almost here, talks have been growing as to who could be his successor should he choose to retire. Cook has made no official public mention of stepping down yet, but according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, the tech giant is working behind the scenes to ensure a seamless transition when the time comes.
Cook replaced Steve Jobs in 2011, and after a period of uncertainty, Cook ushered Apple into its most profitable era. Stock-watching website Stocktwits reports that the company's stock has increased by around 1,800% since Cook took over leading the company.

Jobs may have introduced devices like the iPhone into everyday use that changed how we interact with technology, but Cook expanded on the Apple experience. Under his guidance, the company built upon Apple's smartphone by introducing subscription services and more mobile products, including earbuds and wearables.
He introduced Apple Pay, Beats headphones became part of the company's ecosystem, the Apple Watch launched 10 years ago, and Apple even entered the entertainment business, producing original Oscar-winning movies and Emmy-winning TV shows through Apple TV Plus.

Tim Cook shows off the new orange iPhone 17 at 2025's Apple Event.
We should reiterate that the notion of Cook stepping down is pure speculation at this point. We don't know what Apple's CEO is currently planning or what his thoughts about retirement may be. That said, there are a handful of contenders who have reportedly been part of the succession conversation. 
Apple likely has ""a solid bench of successors"" that the company's board has been developing, says Bryan Ma, VP of Devices Research at IDC.
""But the anxiety gets amplified when there isn't clear visibility for such a valuable and iconic company,"" Ma says. ""Compounding the challenge is the fact that the bar has been set by big rock stars like Steve Jobs and Tim Cook. The next generation of leaders have very big shoes to fill.""
John Ternus, Apple's current vice president of Hardware Engineering, was top of Gurman's list. Ternus has been with the tech giant for more than two decades, so he has the knowledge and experience for a chief executive upgrade. There would be value in having an engineer behind the wheel. 
Ternus appeared during the September Apple event to introduce the iPhone Air. At 50, he's the same age Cook was when he took over as Apple CEO.
Other potential contenders are also being considered, including Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering; Greg Joswiak, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing; and Jeff Williams, the company's former chief operating officer, according to a report by Apple Insider. On Oct. 10, Bloomberg reported that Federighi also will soon be overseeing the Apple Watch operating system watchOS, while Ternus will be overseeing Apple Watch hardware engineering once Williams departs at the end of the year.
Federighi has been with Apple for a long time and has the public speaking experience -- frequently speaking during Apple Events -- that would be vital if he replaced Cook as CEO. Considering his current role, Joswiak has a more marketing perspective and a broader overview of the company and may not be as hands-on with the tech as Ternus and Federighi. And according to Gurman, Williams was viewed as a shoo-in to be Cook's replacement until his role as COO was announced to be ending. (He's now Apple's senior vice president of design, watch and health.) Cook held the position of chief operating officer before he replaced Jobs as CEO in 2011. Sabih Khan will be stepping into that COO role, which also puts his name in the running.
When Cook steps down, Apple will undoubtedly have a pool of qualified talent to choose from to take up the leadership mantle. Who exactly will take the mantle remains to be seen.
Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment."

Whole Foods is getting in on the small grocery store trend.
On Thursday, the Amazon-owned chain expanded its Whole Foods Market Daily Shop concept with the first location outside New York City. The store is located across the Potomac River from Washington, DC, in Arlington, Virginia — right around the corner from Amazon's HQ2.
At about 10,000 square feet, this Daily Shop location is about a quarter of the size of a normal Whole Foods store. And, as the name implies, Amazon's goal isn't really to offer the store's patrons everything they might need for their weekly grocery haul.
""If you want a quick lunch, need some ingredients on your way home from work, or you're stopping in for a meal to go ahead of a flight, we're ready to serve you,"" store team leader Jose Gomez said in a statement about Thursday's opening.
A Whole Foods spokesperson said that Daily Shop offers a similar product selection to regular Whole Foods stores, ""but you won't see things like a hot bar or full-service meat and seafood cases that you'd see in our traditional, larger store formats.""
""Each category will have a smaller selection, but every category is still represented with various options and price points for the customer,"" the spokesperson said.
The Daily Shop format is designed for dense urban areas, Amazon said when it introduced the concept last year. Other smaller-format supermarkets, such as Aldi and Grocery Outlet, have been expanding rapidly in the US.
I headed to the latest Daily Shop location on opening day to see what shopping there is like. Here's what I found.
This space housed an Amazon Fresh location before it closed last year. The area around it includes several apartment and condominium complexes, a Metro stop, one of DC's airports, and one of the major freeways leading into and out of Washington, DC.
Amazon selected this part of Arlington as the location for its HQ2 in 2018. Since then, the company has opened offices and other facilities in the area, such as this AWS Skills Center.
Whole Foods used to operate small stores under the name Whole Foods 365. This chain focused on the company's store-brand products and prepared foods. The stores were aimed at younger, price-focused consumers.
The company shuttered the stores in 2019.
While it's also a small-format grocery store, Daily Shop avoids some of the mistakes that Whole Foods made with its 365 locations, said Phil Lempert, a food industry analyst and editor of the website Supermarket Guru.
The 365 stores carried mainly store-brand products to compete with other grocery chains on prices, Lempert said. ""365 was just searching for a way to get the Kroger shopper to come to the store,"" he said.
Lempert, who has visited other Daily Shop stores, said that the new stores carry items at multiple price points and are more focused on convenience than price. On my visit, for example, I spotted store-brand items as well as fancy French cheeses.
It helps that Amazon has cut prices on many items at all Whole Foods stores since it acquired the chain in 2017, he said.
""I think the Daily Shop store is back to food and really understanding the consumer,"" he said.
A Whole Foods spokesperson said the format is meant to be quick and convenient, bringing stores closer to some customers and extending the company's reach into surrounding neighborhoods.
""This format is designed to provide customers a quick, convenient shopping experience with easier access to the fresh, high-quality offerings they expect from Whole Foods Market,"" the Whole Foods spokesperson said. ""These stores bring Whole Foods Market closer to existing customers, while extending the company's reach to others in surrounding neighborhoods.""
This sign, a reference to Whole Foods' quality standards, appeared above the prepared food department.
I picked up a bag of these tortilla chips. The tequila lime flavoring was tasty, though they needed more of it.
I've enjoyed Whole Foods' pizza bar at other locations, so I was happy to see it at Daily Shop.
This Friday-only discount on tiramisu and tres leches cake was for members of Amazon Prime.
While 365 products were throughout the store, I usually saw at least one name-brand equivalent, whether I was looking at breakfast cereal or toothpaste. That supports Lempert's point that Daily Shop isn't as focused on cheap groceries as its small-format predecessor was.
Bananas are a staple at virtually every grocery store, though if you wanted one or two, you might be better off getting them for free down the street at one of Amazon's community banana stands.
Many Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh locations let Amazon customers make returns at their stores, and this Whole Foods Daily Shop location was no exception.
I headed for one of the open self-checkouts, though there was at least one regular checkout staffed by a person if I had wanted that.
The store wasn't as busy as I worried it might be on opening day, so I didn't have to wait in line to pay.
The checkout area was small, likely a reflection of this format's focus on quick trips.
Whole Foods has a list of about 300 ingredients that it doesn't allow in any of the food it sells, from foie gras to some food colorings. The shopping bag I got at checkout had dozens of them printed right on it.
Daily Shop seems to live up to Whole Foods' promises. It's not meant to replace a larger grocery store, but it's a reasonable option if you need a few ingredients for a recipe or want something easy to heat up for dinner on the way home from work.
This Daily Shop store has competition on both fronts, though, with several restaurants on the block, and a Costco and a full-size Whole Foods about a 10-minute walk away.
That will be part of the challenge for these urban stores: Cities usually have lots of easy, quick food options, and Daily Shop will need to stand out in a crowd.

Andy is a technology journalist with nearly a decade in the industry. He covers a wide spectrum of tech topics, but his current focus includes uncovering the latest and greatest Android apps that offer smart solutions to digital dilemmas.
Android Authority‘s expert staff reviews and rates dozens of new products and services each month, building on almost two decades of expertise. Read how we test products and services.
Products on this list have received Android Authority’s “The Best” award, recognizing top picks in their respective product category.
I’ve tested a dizzying number of dual-SIM Android phones in my time, and even that’s a fraction of our collective knowledge at Android Authority. The best devices never sit on their perch for long before a new pretender to the crown comes along to usurp it. This makes it an exciting and ever-changing field you must keep abreast of. Look no further if you’re in the market for a dual-SIM Android phone.
Samsung usually throws everything and the kitchen sink into its Ultra smartphones; the latest generation is no exception. You get a competent dual-SIM smartphone for travel, power users, or those who just want the best Samsung cash can buy.
The Galaxy S25 Ultra supports different dual-SIM configurations depending on your region. In the US, it primarily supports one physical Nano-SIM and one eSIM.
Let’s acknowledge the elephant in the room. The Galaxy S25 Ultra is a massive device that packs a 6.9-inch display and weighs 218g. If you can get around this with forearms of steel, you’ll be impressed by this device’s solid all-around experience. Personally, I think this minor inconvenience is well worth it.
As an avid scribbler, I find the S Pen a massive boon. Its large display is the perfect canvas for ideas, doodles, or impromptu artworks. Beyond this special skill, I appreciate the phone’s sprightliness thanks to the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy. Whatever you want to do on this device, whether it’s to slam it with games or record content for vlogs, the chipset has got you covered.
Speaking of imaging, one of the Galaxy S25 Ultra’s biggest appeals is its rear camera setup. That 200MP primary sensor is plenty versatile, while the dedicated telephoto lenses allow me to reach even further if needed.
It may be one of the most expensive traditional phones money can buy, but Samsung’s flagship really does do everything a smartphone owner could ever want or need.
Samsung has long led the pack regarding foldable phones, but the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is one of the best devices in this genre ever. Sure, there are thinner products, but the seventh-generation Fold now combines all that mature technology and experience into one impressive handset.
The Galaxy Z Fold 7 supports different regional dual-SIM configurations, but in the US, it primarily supports one physical Nano-SIM and one eSIM.
Importantly, all the core features and specs have seen some improvements. This includes a more sensible cover screen that feels plucked from a traditional smartphone, a chipset that outperforms the silicon in the Fold 6, and a camera array that finally brings foldables up to speed with Samsung’s regular flagship phones.
This all comes at a cost, though — quite literally. At a peep under $2,000, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is more of an investment than a smartphone has ever been. Factor in the remaining chinks in its armor, like the missing S Pen support and tardy charging speeds, and you’re still hamstrung in some aspects.
Nevertheless, if a book-style fold is on your wishlist and you have the cash to make your dreams come true, I recommend the Fold 7 as your dual-SIM phone of choice.
While Samsung wins the book-fold battle, Motorola pips it to the post in the flip-fold race. The Motorola Razr Ultra is head and shoulders above the best of the rest, including the Galaxy Z Flip 7. Yes, it’s expensive, but it rewards that investment with buzzy flagship performance in a compact device that makes plenty of sense.
The Razr Ultra supports dual-SIM functionality with one physical SIM slot and an eSIM profile.
As a flip fold, the Ultra’s party piece is its remarkable 7-inch display that refreshes at 165Hz. But, if you don’t need all those pixels, the external 4-inch cover panel is large enough and bright enough to send texts, check notifications, and use as a selfie mirror.
Speaking of cameras, the Ultra offers photographers a solid imaging base. With a large 4,700mAh battery and dizzying 68W wired charging, it’s the perfect phone for long calls and even longer adventures.
The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL is the company’s latest and largest traditional flagship, and it is wearing this badge with pride. For US users, the Pixel 10 series ditches physical SIM card slots in favor of eSIM technology, which makes switching carriers less reliant on that metal pin we all keep on our keyrings.
Notably, US Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL models do not have a physical SIM card slot. As a result, dual-SIM functionality can only be achieved by using two eSIM profiles. International models include a physical SIM slot, which can be utilized alongside an eSIM profile for dual-SIM purposes.
Google has invested in several areas, including photography and battery capacity, for the actual phone. The XL now packs a 5,200mAh reservoir, the largest battery ever in a Pixel smartphone. The camera array is headlined by a 50MP main sensor, with a 48MP 5x periscope lens and a 48MP ultrawide in support. We’ve noticed significant improvements in color science on this handset compared to the Pixel 9 series.
Of course, Google’s biggest draw is its Pixel-exclusive features, which now includes Camera Coach to help novices snap the perfect shot and Magic Cue, which acts as a smart context-aware information recommendation service.
If you’re not in the market for a flagship Pixel or still want the convenience of a physical SIM slot, the Pixel 9a remains a stellar choice.
The Pixel 9a, unlike the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL, has a physical SIM slot. It supports one physical SIM slot with one eSIM profile in the US.
There’s very little that Google’s mid-range contender does wrong. In fact, if value is your barometer, it may just be the best phone of 2025. It offers a solid bump-free dual camera array, a roomy 5,100mAh battery, and a spacious 6.3-inch screen.
At a smidge under $500, the Pixel 9a is an excellent, affordable dual-SIM Android phone that’ll be supported well into the next decade.
The ASUS ROG Phone series has long stood out as the best gaming smartphone available, and the ROG Phone 9 Pro is the pinnacle. It might be geared towards those seeking the best performance, but it is a device you can use as a daily driver.
It supports dual-SIM functionality through two physical SIM card slots. Notably, eSIM support is only available for select regional models, including those sold in Japan and Taiwan.
For starters, it makes no concessions for performance and was among the first devices to run the Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC. Most current titles will run quickly and smoothly, while its 5,800mAh battery takes a fair while to drain completely. As a gaming phone, its camera hardware is surprisingly serviceable, while its video stabilization makes it a great live-action camera in a pinch.
The ROG Phone 9 Pro will likely soon make way for its successor, and considering its relatively lofty price, it might be a tough pill to swallow. But if you are looking for a pure gaming phone that also excels as a pocket companion, this is the device to purchase.
As most modern smartphones now support dual-SIM smarts, picking a good one comes down to specifics and your intended use case. Generally, I’d recommend first considering devices that offer reliable signal strength in various environments. Beyond that, it really depends on your needs.
Here’s how I decide which dual-SIM device is best for me:

17,2025-10-25,"US President Donald Trump is arriving in Asia for a whirlwind week of diplomacy, which includes a much-anticipated meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping.
Top of the agenda will be trade – an area where tensions between the world's two biggest economies have once again been ramping up.
Trump lands in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, as a summit for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, begins on Sunday. He will then visit Japan and finally South Korea, where the White House says he will meet Xi.  
So what are the wins Trump and other leaders are hoping for, and what are the pitfalls? 
Our correspondents explain what you should know about the week ahead.
By Anthony Zurcher, North America correspondent
Inking new trade deals that provide opportunities to American businesses while keeping the tariff revenue flowing into the US Treasury is sure to be a central focus of Trump's Asia trip.
While there are multiple players in the global trade dance, the key to Trump's success or failure is China. And Trump's scheduled meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on the sidelines of Apec – the first since 2019 – could set the course for US-China relations for the rest of Trump's second term in office.
As the US president has acknowledged, draconian tariffs on Chinese imports are unsustainable. And while he has not explicitly said so, an escalating economic war with America's largest trading partner would have devastating consequences – for the US, for China and for the rest of the world.
The steep tumbles in the major US stock indexes every time China and the US appear at an impasse underlines this reality.
When he heads back to America next week, Trump is sure to be pleased if he is able to finalise a deal with South Korea and secure new Japanese investment in US manufacturing.
But his top priority is sure to be convincing Xi to resume purchases of American agricultural exports, loosen recent restrictions on foreign access to Chinese rare earth materials, give US companies greater access to the Chinese market and avoid a full-blown trade war.
For Trump, as the saying goes, that's the whole ballgame.
By Laura Bicker, China correspondent
When Chinese leader Xi Jinping meets Trump on 30 October in South Korea, he wants to be the tougher negotiator.
That is why he has been leveraging China's stranglehold on rare earths, the minerals without which you cannot make semiconductors, weapons systems, cars or even smartphones. It's a US weakness, and China is exploiting it – just like it is hurting American farmers, and Trump's rural vote base, by not buying their soybeans.
Xi has also learned lessons from Trump 1.0 and this time, Beijing, it appears, is willing to embrace the pain of tariffs. For one, the US, which once took in a fifth of Chinese exports, is no longer such a crucial market.
Still Xi has a balance to strike, between an economic battle with the US, and his struggle with domestic challenges. And Washington knows about Xi's troubles: high youth unemployment, a real estate crisis, mounting local government debt and a population unwilling to spend.
Analysts believe China may offer to do a deal if Trump agrees to start exporting advanced AI chips or pull back on more military support for Taiwan.
But getting there won't be easy. One big difference is that it often seems like Trump is willing to roll a dice and gamble – but Xi is playing a much longer game.
So the question may be: can Trump wait it out?
By Jonathan Head, South East Asia correspondent
The US president appears interested in one thing only during his visit to Malaysia: playing the starring role in a ceremony arranged specially for him, at which Thailand and Cambodia will sign some kind of peace accord.
Differences between the two countries over their border remain unresolved, but, under pressure to come up with something, they have made progress in agreeing to demilitarise the border.
Neither can afford to disappoint President Trump. Back in July, when they were still bombing and shelling each other, his threat to end tariff talks forced them into an immediate ceasefire.
Other Asean member states will hope for Trump's mere presence, brief though it is, to normalise relations with the US. 
They have had a tumultuous year in which their export-dependent economies were badly shaken by his tariff war. Exports from the region to the US have doubled since Trump's last visit to the Asean summit in 2017.
Once Trump leaves, the other leaders can settle down to normal business – the quiet, incremental diplomacy which advances the plodding progress of integration among them.
Also on the agenda is a conflict that doesn't have Trump's attention - the civil war in Myanmar, which has haunted every Asean gathering since it was triggered by a brutal coup in 2021.
By Suranjana Tewari, Asia business correspondent 
Asia's manufacturing powerhouses, which make up much of the world's output, will be looking for respite from Trump's tariffs.
Some have agreed deals, while others are still stuck in talks – but none have signed an agreement.
So ink on paper, or at least promising talks, would be welcome.
Take China. The meeting between Trump and Xi signals progress, but the two leaders have a lot to unpick, from levies and export controls, to the source of it all: rivalry between the world's two biggest economies as they compete for an edge in AI and advanced tech.
Any ease in those tensions would bring relief to other countries in the region who have been caught in the middle. South East Asia may be the most trapped – it is deeply woven into US supply chains in electronics, for example, yet heavily reliant on Chinese demand.
Exports to the US have doubled over the past decade, but tariffs of 10% to 40% would pummel manufacturers in Vietnam, Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand. 
It could also hurt US chipmakers like Micron Technology, which operates plants in Malaysia. The country exported around $10bn worth of semiconductors to the US last year, roughly a fifth of total US chip imports.
Wealthy economies like Japan and South Korea face a different dilemma. 
Although close allies of the US, they are in for an unpredictable time – and will want to lock in tariff terms and investments. Automakers in both countries, which see the US as a key market, are already struggling to navigate the chaos.
By Shaimaa Khalil, Japan correspondent 
Trump has described Japan's new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, as a woman with great ""strength and wisdom"".
This week, her ability to forge a stable, working relationship with him will be an early test of her leadership - and of Japan's place in a shifting world order.
In her first speech in parliament, she pledged to raise Japan's defence budget, signalling her intent to shoulder more of the security burden with Washington. 
Trump has spoken of this before and is expected to press Tokyo to contribute more to US troop deployments - Japan hosts the largest number of American forces abroad, about 53,000 personnel.
Both sides also want to finalise a tariff deal negotiated by her predecessor. 
Particularly beneficial to Japan's auto giants - Toyota, Honda and Nissan - it cuts US import duties on Japanese cars from 27.5% to 15%, potentially making them more competitive against Chinese rivals.
By retaining Ryosei Akazawa as chief tariff negotiator, Takaichi is betting on continuity.
In return, Japan has pledged to invest $550bn in the US to strengthen supply chains in pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. 
Trump has also said Japan will increase purchases of US farm products, including rice, a move welcomed in Washington but unsettling for Japanese farmers.
Takaichi's ties to the late former PM Shinzo Abe, who shared a close rapport with Trump, could also work in her favour. 
Abe famously used rounds of golf at Mar-a-Lago to earn Trump's trust – it's the kind of personal diplomacy Takaichi may seek to emulate.
By Jake Kwon, Seoul correspondent 
For South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, the pressing issue is Trump's tariffs.
But that thunder was briefly stolen by rampant speculation that Trump might visit the border to see North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Back in August, Lee dedicated most of his time in the Oval Office to flatter Trump as a ""peacemaker"". Trump responded with enthusiasm to the prospect of sitting down with Kim, who he hasn't seen since 2019. Kim said last month that he still remembers Trump ""fondly"".
Analysts believe Kim is hoping to legitimise his nuclear weapons programme with another summit with the US president. There is no indication that a meeting is in the works. 
Either way, Lee has a trade deal to negotiate. Talks to lower US duties on South Korean exports from 25% to 15% have stalled, despite multiple trips by Seoul officials to Washington. The sticking point is Trump's insistence that Seoul invest $350bn upfront in the US – roughly a fifth of South Korea's economy, such a huge investment could create a financial crisis, Seoul fears.
But in recent days, Korean officials have voiced hope, speaking of tangible progress. And they will be hoping for a signed deal by the end of Wednesday's summit between Trump and Lee.
Data centres were billed as a boon to Virginia’s economy. Now, residents are concerned about their impact on real estate and electricity costs.
Saying that airing the advert was a hostile act, Trump announced an additional 10% ""over and above what they are paying now"".
The deployment marks a major escalation in what the US says is a campaign against drug traffickers, which Trump warns will include ""land action"".
The former vice president made her strongest suggestion to date that she will make another presidential bid in 2028 - after losing to Donald Trump last year.
The man is a US citizen and a Trump supporter, the president has said, but no one in the government will identify him.

The high p/e growth names that get the most attention because of their growth or their potential for growth (according to analysts) are having a nice time. This era will eventually end and that might be sooner rather than later once the Trump tariffs inflation and the lower interest rates inflation really kick in.
In the long run, it might be wise to at least take a look at cheap stocks – that is, those that trade below their book value. That’s the number found when total liabilities are subtracted from total assets.  Even now, despite the market’s generally extraordinary valuation, some companies trade for less than they’re worth on the ledger.
Some pay dividend yields that come close to or are greater than the current T-bill rate.
Deutsche Bank:
The German bank with global operations has a market capitalization of $64.76 billion. It trades at a 15% discount to its book value with a price-earnings ratio of 10.24. The debt-to-equity ratio is 2.29. Big financial services stocks like this are sensitive to interest rate changes, in Europe, in the US and at central banks worldwide. Deutsche Bank pays a 3.48% dividend. 
The weekly price chart shows an uptrend since the late September/early October 2022 low of near $7. The 50-week moving average in May/June 2023 crossed above the 200-week moving average. After touching a high near $38 a few weeks ago, the stock has backed off and the RSI has dropped out of the “overbought” range.
Lincoln National:
This life insurance company, with corporate headquarters in Radnor, Pennsylvania, has a market cap of $7.57 billion and shares can be purchased at 88% of book value. The price-earnings ratio is 6.97. The debt-to-equity ratio is .60. Lincoln National pays a 4.51% dividend. 
The stock bottomed in May 2023 at near $16 and now trades at $39.93. In mid April 2025, the 50-week moving average crossed above the 200-week moving average, a generally positive sign. The relative strenght indicator peaked in April and has now dropped from its “overbought” zone. 
Matador Resources:
The oil and gas exploration company trades at an 11% discount from its book value. The Dallas-based operation has a price-earnings ratio of 6.29. Market cap is $4.89 billion. The debt-to-equity ratio is .58. This year’s earnings are off by 22% and up over the past three years by 13%. Matador offers investors a 3.43% dividend. 
The stock hit a peak in November 2022 at just above $70 and now goes for $39.31. The low came in April at near $35. The 50-week moving average in June crossed below the 200-week moving average, not a strong look. 
Nomad Foods:
The packaged foods firm offers name-brand items like Birds-Eye, Ledo and Findus.   Based in the United Kingdom, the company’s market cap is $1.81 billion. The stock trades at 59% of its book value. The price-earnings ratio is 8.05 and the debt-to-equity ratio is .82. Nomad Foods pays a dividend of 6.30%. 
The weekly price chart shows more volatility than the other stocks listed here -- with many ups and downs from the 2022 highs to the present. From February through April, the stock managed to trade above both the 50-week and the 200-week moving averages. Now, it trades below both and is re-testing the October 2022 low (indicated by the red-dotted line).

    After searching through my kitchen cabinets and drawers, I found several potential microplastic culprits hiding there.
  
When I searched through my kitchen, I found more potential microplastic sources than I expected.
When you imagine what's inside your body, you likely picture your heart, brain and other essential organs -- not pieces of plastic. However, plastic in the human body has become increasingly common.
It's been estimated that Americans consume 39,000 to 52,000 microplastic particles each year, through the food we eat, the water we drink and even the kitchen items we use to prepare, cook and store our food. Microplastic particles are less than 5mm in length, meaning they're smaller than a sesame seed. While more research is needed, Stanford Medicine reports that some studies have linked microplastics to cell damage, a weakened immune system, abnormal organ development and certain cancers, among other health issues. 
Though it may be easier to simply stick with the plastic containers and kitchen utensils you already have, making simple swaps for glass, metal or wooden items might be worth it in the long run. After all, the price of a glass storage container seems reasonable when it comes to protecting your health. 
Though microplastics and their possible health effects have been making headlines for quite some time, I'd been putting off going through my own kitchen to see where they could be hiding. Now it's time to face the music. This is what I discovered. 
Just a few of the plastic containers I found hiding in my cabinet.
When I went through my storage container cabinet, I found several plastic containers. Some I use solely for storing dry goods, while others are reserved for saving leftovers in the refrigerator and reheating them in the microwave. The latter do say they're refrigerator-, dishwasher- and microwave-safe, but they all show signs of wear and should definitely be replaced. 
A September 2024 study determined that of the 14,000 known food contact chemicals present in food packaging, 3,601 of them, or about 25%, were detected in humans. Specifically, 235 FCCs in materials that come into contact with food have been found in humans, including plastic compounds.
There is also particular worry regarding the use of microwaves and plastic containers. A June 2023 study concluded that heating a plastic container in the microwave resulted in the highest release of microplastics and nanoplastics into food, compared to refrigeration, storage at room temperature and other use. However, refrigeration and room temperature storage can still release up to billions of microplastics and nanoplastics into their contents over the course of six months. Nanoplastics are even smaller than microplastics, measuring less than 1 micron, making them potentially more damaging to the human body. 
This is especially a concern with plastic takeout containers that don't say they're heat-safe, and even then, that might just be marketing jargon. This year, it was reported that Rubbermaid is being sued for claiming that its plastic containers are ""microwave safe"" and ""freezer safe"" when, allegedly, they still release microplastics into food. A representative for Rubbermaid did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
An August 2024 review determined that even during freezing and thawing, microplastics can be released from the inner surface of food containers. Another concern is that if frozen, the plastic can break off from the containers and contaminate your food. 
While BPA-free containers, which don't contain the industrial chemical bisphenol A, may be better because you avoid potential health effects (though, again, more studies are needed), glass containers are your best bet. 
I plan to replace my current plastic containers with glass ones. I've already swapped a few with the new Tupperware Voila collection -- safe for the oven, microwave, freezer, dishwasher and under the broiler (with the lid off) -- which the brand kindly sent me to try. However, I also want to stock up on smaller containers.
The dreaded black plastic spatula I should have replaced ages ago.
Like plastic containers, your plastic kitchen utensils can also release microplastic particles into your food, as reported by a June 2024 systematic review. 
I use wooden cutting boards, metal cutlery, a silicone spatula solely for mixing room-temperature ingredients and wood and metal cooking utensils, so I thought I was in the clear with plastic utensils -- until I spotted one thing: a black plastic spatula. I know I should have gotten rid of it by now but it's the perfect width for flipping pancakes and fried eggs. Writing this article is the wake-up call I need. 
I'm planning to replace my black plastic spatula with either a metal or wooden one. I already have several wood spatulas, but none are wide enough, so I might opt for a stainless steel fish spatula, such as the OXO Good Grips Stainless Steel Fish Turner ($18) or the Victorinox 40415 Turner Slotted Wood ($54). 
Guess it's time to invest in a glass air fryer.
I have the Philips 3000 Series air fryer and, upon researching its composition, I was surprised to find that Philips air fryer parts are mostly coated with non-stick PTFE, which is a type of plastic.
Philips states that this is a common coating compliant with existing legislation on food contact materials. However, a June 2024 study found that PTFE-coated cookware, like my air fryer, can still release microplastics and nanoplastics if the coating is scratched by hard, sharp utensils or used at higher temperatures.
CNET's pick for the best air fryer overall is the Ninja Crispi, which is made of glass and free from PFAS and PTFE, thanks to its crisper plate that uses a nano-ceramic coating, not plastic. I will be adding this to my holiday wishlist. 
I was disappointed to learn that my beloved tea bags could contain plastic.
I found dozens of tea bags in my designated tea jar and the kitchen cabinet where I store extra boxes, but I was shocked to learn they didn't just contain my favorite teas. 
A February 2025 review found that tea bags are the greatest contributors of microplastic particles to hot tea when the bag and string are steeped, as more than 1 billion microplastics and nanoplastics can be released into the liquid. It also doesn't matter whether the tea bags contain plastic that's used to heat-seal the bags or are biodegradable, as the latter can still be created with plastic. 
Upon examining all my tea bags, I found that most of them claim to be compostable, which means they're made from plant-based materials and don't contain plastic. However, I do have some tea bags that don't have this label, meaning that they may contain microplastics.
If you're wondering about the difference between compostable and biodegradable, not-for-profit environmental company Oceanwatch Australia says compostable products are made with organic elements that can break down over time in the right environment, like in a compost bin, while biodegradable products can be made of either plant-based materials or petroleum-based plastic (which could leave behind microplastics).
Instead of relying on non-compostable tea bags for a hot beverage, I can choose loose-leaf tea instead. I already have stainless steel tea infusers that I can use for steeping. To ensure that nothing leaches into the water I use to brew my tea, I can use a glass electric kettle, such as CNET's favorite OXO Adjustable Temperature Kettle ($120). 
While there's no need to panic and hurriedly replace every single item that's plastic in your kitchen, as more studies are required to confirm health effects, there's no harm in slowly swapping out plastic kitchen items for those that are silicone, wood, metal or glass, especially if you're heating, refrigerating, dishwashing or freezing them. After all, a glass item a day could keep the microplastics away. "

As digital storefronts shutter and luxury platforms file for bankruptcy, the promise of democratized online shopping confronts the reality of margin compression, return exploitation and a luxury customer exodus. After a decade of aggressive online expansion, luxury is confronting a hard truth: scale dilutes exclusivity. In 2025, a sector once synonymous with limitless growth is facing the limits of digital scale. Multi-brand luxury platforms are collapsing, e-commerce growth is flattening, and brands are rediscovering that ubiquity and exclusivity rarely coexist. What went wrong, and who’s surviving?
In August 2025, Montreal-based SSENSE filed for bankruptcy protection with $152 million in debt and severe liquidity constraints. By that point, the company’s sales had already fallen 28% year-over-year in the first half of 2025. Creditors moved to force a sale, prompting SSENSE to file its own restructuring application to maintain control of its operations and assets. A court-approved restructuring plan allowed SSENSE to continue operating while seeking new investors. It will continue under Ernst & Young’s oversight, supported by a $15 million emergency loan which is a fraction of its outstanding debt. The full list of creditors detailed in their restructuring documents includes over $12 million (CAD) owed to conglomerate brands like Kering and LVMH alone.
Just weeks later, Highsnobiety announced it would permanently close its e-commerce division by year-end and lay off 50 employees, refocusing on editorial content, brand consulting, and cultural activations. Owned by Zalando, the Berlin-based company cited operational challenges, slowing consumer demand, and changing market dynamics.
They are not alone. Farfetch, Matches Fashion, LuisaViaRoma, and Yoox Net-a-Porter have all undergone bankruptcies, restructurings, or fire sales since 2024. For some, restructuring reflects recalibration, not extinction. But collectively, the trend signals fatigue in the multi-brand luxury model. Even conglomerates such as Saks Global and Neiman Marcus are struggling with liquidity and vendor payment delays. What was supposed to be the future of luxury, always on, everywhere available, has become a cautionary tale.
Beyond luxury, e-commerce overall has entered a mature phase of slower growth. In the United States, online sales grew only 5.3% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2025, representing 15.5% of total sales. The first quarter of 2025 saw one of the slowest performances in a decade.
Globally, online sales are projected to reach 6.4 trillion dollars this year, but growth has slowed to under 7%, the lowest since 2022. The slowdown stems from several intersecting trends facing the channel.
The omnichannel model that once promised exponential reach has become an expensive balancing act. For luxury, which thrives on scarcity and mystique, this model can be fundamentally misaligned.
The broader luxury market is also cooling. Global personal luxury goods sales are expected to decline by as much as 5% this year, marking the steepest contraction since the global financial crisis. After years of pandemic-era acceleration, this correction reflects normalization as much as crisis. Overpricing, credibility concerns, slowing demand in China, and consumers redirecting spending toward experiences and wellness are driving these downturns. Roughly 50 million customers have exited the luxury category since 2022.
There however have been a few exceptions. The most notable standout remains Hermès,
 which continues to outperform peers through limited production, steady pricing discipline, and masterful storytelling. Hermès avoids digital discounting and maintains a controlled supply that ensures demand exceeds availability. Its success underscores a lesson the rest of the industry is relearning: exclusivity cannot be mass-distributed.
Even as Hermès posted strong Q3 2025 results with sales up 9.6%, and LVMH managed modest 1% overall growth, the broader e-commerce ecosystem has been decimated. LVMH’s fashion and leather goods division actually contracted 2% in Q3, following a 7% decline in the first half. Although Hermes, LVMH, Kering, and Richemont have each posted positive results, can this be sustained?
Scarcity is luxury’s defining value proposition. Yet the logic of omnichannel distribution is rooted in scale, convenience, and constant availability. Selling “everywhere, to everyone” erodes the very essence of what makes luxury desirable.
In e-commerce, the more visible a product becomes, the less rare it feels. The constant accessibility of luxury goods undermines the sense of privilege that exclusivity depends on. The friction that once made luxury thrilling, the waitlist, the boutique appointment, the limited drop, has been replaced by an infinite scroll.
Luxury e-commerce platforms, by contrast, attempted to scale the unscalable. This tension explains why digital-first luxury platforms like SSENSE and Farfetch are faltering. Their multi-brand assortments and price transparency made once-aspirational goods feel transactional. When everything can be compared, the brand loses control of the story.
Not every multi-brand e-tailer suffered the same fate. Mytheresa, the Munich-based luxury platform that went public in 2021, has become the sector’s outlier success story. In the final quarter of its fiscal 2025 ending June, net sales grew 12 % for the quarter and 9% for the full fiscal year, while adjusted EBITDA surged 73%. Gross merchandise volume from its highest-spending clients, those shelling out 6 figures or more annually, jumped 16%. The company’s stock price climbed 17% in pre-market trading following the earnings release.
CEO Michael Kliger attributed the success to focus: ""We didn't know that this big slowdown in aspirational demand would happen, but we were well prepared."" Rather than chasing volume, Mytheresa doubled down on its top customers, and avoided the trap of competing on price. The company invested in building an algorithm to support this focus by identifying customers most likely to remain loyal long-term. It's a radically different approach in an industry that typically measures success in conversion rates and customer acquisition costs.
The contrast is stark. While Mytheresa thrived by narrowing its focus, other players tried to be all things to all luxury shoppers, diluting positioning and competing on breadth rather than depth.
The luxury industry’s next chapter will not be defined by being everywhere. It will be defined by being exactly where it matters most. The platforms that survive will be those that answer a simple question: Why would a customer buy from you instead of going directly to the brand? Having a selective digital presence, focusing on experience-first retail, and the curation of access through events like limited drops and waitlists will fuel loyalty.
The digital divide in luxury is no longer about who sells online and who does not. It is about who understands that digital scale and exclusivity are often incompatible. The failures of SSENSE, Highsnobiety, and Farfetch highlight a philosophical clash between luxury’s DNA and mass-market dynamics.
Physical retail, meanwhile, is rediscovering its purpose. Stores are no longer just points of sale but brand expressions, places to build relationships and create memories. Luxury brands are investing in flagship experiences such as Gucci's Cosmos exhibits, Loewe’s Crafted World, Dolce & Gabbana’s Paris exhibition, Du Coeur à la Main, Prada's cultural collaborations. These aren't retail in the traditional sense. They're brand-building exercises that happen to include a shop.
Luxury will not abandon digital. But its future lies in controlled access, not constant access. The most valuable channel is not the one with the widest reach, but the one with the most meaning."

Lithuanian manufacturer Baltic Tiny House has launched its most compact offering yet with the BTH Single, a 190-square-foot tiny home that strips away excess to focus on essential living. Starting at €37,190 (approximately $43,000), this diminutive dwelling represents both an affordable entry point into tiny house ownership and a philosophical return to the movement’s minimalist origins.
Designer: Baltic Tiny House







The BTH Single measures just 18 square meters (193 square feet) and stretches 7.2 meters (23 feet) in length on a double-axle trailer. Despite its modest footprint, the home comfortably sleeps two people while maintaining an uncluttered, functional layout that prioritizes essential living spaces over luxury amenities.
The exterior showcases Baltic Tiny House’s attention to both aesthetics and durability through wood finished with the Japanese shou sugi ban method. This traditional technique involves charring the wood surface to create a natural protective barrier that preserves the material while adding distinctive visual texture.







What sets the BTH Single apart in today’s tiny house market is its exceptional affordability. At €37,190, it undercuts many competitors while maintaining Baltic Tiny House’s reputation for quality construction. This pricing strategy appears designed to make tiny house living accessible to a broader demographic, particularly those seeking alternatives to traditional housing markets.
The competitive pricing doesn’t compromise on construction quality. Like other Baltic Tiny House models, the BTH Single features exceptional insulation designed to provide comfort across all seasons, from warm summers to harsh winters. This focus on thermal performance reflects the company’s Nordic design sensibilities and practical understanding of year-round living requirements.

The BTH Single’s compact dimensions require thoughtful consideration of daily living patterns and storage needs. With just 193 square feet of interior space, residents must embrace intentional living practices, carefully curating possessions and maximizing multi-functional furniture solutions. The single-level design eliminates the loft bedrooms common in many tiny houses, potentially appealing to those who prefer ground-level sleeping arrangements or have mobility considerations.
This configuration also creates a more open feel within the limited square footage, avoiding the cramped sensation that can accompany loft-style layouts. Storage solutions become critical in such a compact environment, requiring creative built-in solutions and disciplined organization systems. The home’s design philosophy suggests that successful BTH Single living depends on embracing minimalism not just as an aesthetic choice, but as a practical lifestyle approach.

The BTH Single arrives at a time when the tiny house movement appears to be reassessing its priorities. After years of increasingly elaborate and expensive designs, there’s renewed interest in the movement’s original principles: living with less, reducing environmental impact, and achieving housing affordability. This Lithuanian manufacturer’s approach suggests a mature understanding of market needs, offering a product that balances aspiration with accessibility.
The BTH Single doesn’t promise luxury or Instagram-worthy amenities. Instead, it delivers on the fundamental promise of tiny house living: a well-designed, affordable home that enables greater financial freedom and simplified living. For potential buyers seeking entry into tiny house ownership without six-figure investments, the BTH Single represents a compelling proposition that honors the movement’s minimalist roots while addressing contemporary affordability challenges.

First of all, a massive thank you to everyone who donated since
our last post. Our income on Liberapay has roughly
quadrupled from what it was before the post. We have also had people reach out
to us for large one-time monetary and hardware donations. Your support is
truly appreciated!
And now for a followup from our last post. TL;DR: the legal firm we’ve engaged
has sent us a memo indicating that in their opinion we can reasonably argue
we do not have sufficient links to the UK for the Online Safety Act to be
applicable to us. They also believe we would be at low risk of attempted
enforcement action even if Ofcom does
consider us to be in-scope for the OSA. We will continue to ensure that this
is the case by keeping internal estimates of our UK user base and by
continuing with our current efforts to keep Libera.Chat reasonably safe. We
have no plans to institute any ID requirements for the forseeable future.
If that’s all you wanted to know, then feel free to stop here.
However, we feel it’s in the best interest of online communities
like ours for us to summarise the advice we were given in hopes that it
will be useful to others. This is not legal advice from us to you.
This advice was provided to Libera Chat as an assessment of our specific
case. We accept no responsibility if you decide to apply advice given to us
to your own online service.
You might be asking why we’ve even bothered to get legal advice on this
matter. Libera Chat (the non-profit that runs the Libera.Chat IRC network)
is based in Sweden. Our bank is Swedish, and we do not rely on any UK-based
payment providers. We have a few servers in the UK, but they can be migrated
on short notice. In other words, the British government has relatively little
authority over us. The most damaging action they can reasonably take is to
instruct internet service providers in the UK to deny access to us.
Relatedly, some online communities have decided that they want to minimise
the authority the British government has over them. In response to critical
analyses of the OSA pointing out its potential for regulatory overreach,
some online communities have taken the understandable precaution of entirely
blocking access from known UK IP addresses, thus cutting off any reasonable
argument that they somehow have links to the UK (more on that later).
The end result is the same: a denial of service to people in the UK solely
because of the country they live in. It’s not an insurmountable barrier to
access in either case, but it shouldn’t be necessary for individuals in the
UK to look into censorship-defeating proxies just to engage with
free software developers and peer-directed projects that choose to have a
community on our IRC network. It doesn’t serve our users, it doesn’t serve
our communities, and it doesn’t serve the UK open source movement.
Therefore, it’s in everyone’s best interest for us look into what’s necessary
to keep things from getting to the point where users in the UK cannot access
Libera.Chat, and that means getting guidance on the OSA.
As the OSA is fairly vague in its definitions, Ofcom has
significant latitude in deciding where the thresholds are for whether an
organisation meets certain criteria or not. Ofcom also hasn’t been forthcoming
with its opinions on where those thresholds are, so there are relatively few
hard guarantees about the applicability of the OSA. Still, there is a strong
argument that while we definitely meet one of the criteria for the OSA to
apply to us, we do not meet the other.
The OSA applies to online service providers that provide a regulated service
and have links to the UK. We unarguably provide a regulated service because
Libera.Chat is a so-called U2U service, i.e. it “allows
‘user-generated content’ to be encountered by another user of the service”.
This is an incredibly broad class of services. Some exceptions are made for
user content that is posted in relation to service content
(e.g. the comment section of a blog) and a few other service types,
but none of them reasonably apply to us. Every chat service, forum,
federated social media server, or code forge counts as a regulated service,
and therefore meets one of the criteria for the OSA to apply to them.
So be it. What about our links to the UK? To quote the memo:
An online service provider has “links to the UK” for the purposes of the OSA
if any one or more of the following apply:
One factor that does not automatically give us links to the UK is the fact
that we have staff members in the UK. Curiously, employees of the
service provider who do not engage with that service as users are actually
excluded for the purposes of determining whether a service has a
“significant number of UK users”. Our staffers are also users, but our
UK staffers make up an insignificant portion of our user base.
Speaking of which, the memo implies that “significance” in this context is
interpreted as being relative to the population of the UK, not relative to
the user base of the service. We have seen risk assessments that take the
other interpretation and consider their UK user base to be “significant”
because it makes up a large portion of their overall user base, but the advice
we received suggests we should not use this interpretation. The exact fraction
of the UK’s online population that must use a given service to be considered
“significant” is unknown, but based on our counsel’s observations of Ofcom’s
previous regulatory actions, it appears to be much higher than our internal
estimates of how large our UK user base is.
The “target market” criterion is meant to capture services with a low number
of UK users that target the UK specifically. While our target market
(people interested in using an IRC-based platform for discussing free
software or other peer-directed projects) is inclusive of UK users, it isn’t
specifically for them. Our network is predominantly English-speaking, but
we do not promote, direct, or tailor our service to UK users in particular.
Finally, there is no atypical material risk of significant harm to
individuals in the UK presented by the messages on Libera.Chat. We block spam
and client exploits. We are proactive in ensuring that our network’s
acceptable use policy is upheld. We do not tolerate incitement to
violence, doxxing, or defamation. And finally, we do not provide file hosting
that can be used to distribute pornographic or sexual abuse media, though when
we sought legal advice from the firm, we acknowledged the existence of DCC
as a commonly-supported mechanism for transferring files using an IRC network
to establish a peer-to-peer connection.
In the coming weeks, we will be finalising a statement
similar to this risk assessment that we can provide to
Ofcom should we ever be contacted by them about the OSA.
While it is our opinion that the OSA does not apply to us, Ofcom might
disagree, and appealing that disagreement would likely involve further
legal expenses. So, what is the risk that Ofcom would decide to try to
impose fines or other regulatory penalties on us?
For the time being, services like ours do not appear to be Ofcom’s priority.
Currently, according to our legal sources, the focus appears to be file and
image hosts that are at high risk of being used to transmit sexually-explicit
depictions of minors. IRC has been used as a way to facilitate piracy, but
those days are generally in the past thanks to more attractive options. Even
if they weren’t, using Libera.Chat for this purpose is risky. We prefer to
exercise the minimum power necessary to keep the network clean, but that
doesn’t mean we don’t have the tools necessary to proactively stop the network
from being used for piracy or CSAM distribution.
We have also been reassured that Ofcom is very likely to contact us with
concerns before attempting any sort of action against us. There are some
classes of concerns that we would certainly be willing to hear out,
and we do prefer a constructive approach to problem resolution where possible.
We’re confident that there isn’t anything for them to be reasonably
concerned about, but we are willing to engage with good-faith reports of
potential abuse of our service.
We have no plans to require users to provide us with proof of identity
and will take every reasonable measure to avoid requiring it.
The justification for us to compromise the privacy of our users
given the content we forbid on Libera.Chat is not adequate,
and the risk of material harm should an identity verification mechanism
compromise our users’ privacy far outweighs the plausible harms caused by
not having such a system. Such violations of privacy aren’t hypothetical;
another chat platform recently was affected by a data breach that potentially
exposed the legal identities of tens of thousands of its users.
That said, it’s conceivable that legislation will be created that could apply
to us and could force us to identify or spy on our users.
If that happens, we will evaluate our options once drafts of such legislation
reach a point where they can conceivably pass. Until then, we hope that the
general public will remain vocally opposed to such attempts at overreach.
Popular opposition
stalled Chat Control earlier this month.
There will probably always be efforts to compromise the free internet,
but their success is not inevitable."

Avalon Hill did a two-in-one announcement, as they revealed HeroQuest Wizards of Morcar, while also revealing the game Market Fresh
Avalon Hill made two reveal announcements this week, as they showed off a new game and a new pack for HeroQuest. First, the new title is Market Fresh, where you and other players are essentially farmers' market types who are competing against each other to have the best shop for people to check out. Meanwhile, the HeroQuest Wizards of Morcar Quest Pack is making a return for the modernized version of the tabletop title, bringing more sorcery and chicanery to the game. We have more details about both below as they arrive in early 2026.
Prepare to go head-to-head with fellow farmers in Market Fresh, the strategic tile-placement game of market mastery! Build the most successful stand by stacking produce crates in your shopfront, maximizing your stock, and shutting competitors out of the market along the way. Earn points with every crate you add, and stack higher to score more – but watch out as market space quickly runs out as the competition heats up! Designed by award-winning designers Michael Kiesling and Wolfgang Kramer, this new tile game features an engaging story, mental depth, beautiful custom artwork, and endless replayability. Inside the box players will find 1 Market Board, 4 Shopfront Boards, 66 Plastic Produce Crates, 44 Farmer Tiles, 8 Point Vouchers, 4 Plastic Score Cubes, and 1 Game Guide.
In 2026, the HeroQuest Wizards of Morcar Quest Pack returns, pitting players against the realm's most feared wielders of Dread Magic – the Wizards of Morcar! The expansion pack will feature 10 quests – 5 based on the original 1991 iteration and 5 new quests. A classic tale returns – Loretome has foreseen the alliance of the realm's most powerful wizards, all of whom have agreed to do Zargon's dark bidding. This time, Zargon seeks the legendary magic of 1,000 Dread sorcerers locked away in the High Alter of the Northern Dread Wastes. Gather your group and work to stop Zargon from getting his hands on the power, or he will be unstoppable. Along with the 10 perilous quests, this fantasy expansion pack features 27 finely detailed miniatures, 64 game cards, a cardboard tile sheet, and a game guide. HeroQuest Game System or HeroQuest First Light required to play, sold separately.

35,2025-10-25,"As bitcoin treasury companies continue to struggle with tumbling share prices and rapidly slowing bitcoin accumulation in a tightening market, many are now trading below a 1x multiple to their net asset value (mNAV). 
In other words, for these “pure play” treasury holders (i.e., excluding miners like MARA Holdings and broader crypto platforms such as Bullish), their market capitalization has dropped beneath the value of their bitcoin holdings.
Semler Scientific (SMLR) began its bitcoin treasury strategy in mid-2024 and accumulated over 5,000 BTC. Despite that, its share price is now trading roughly at the same level it was when the company began its bitcoin journey, around $24 per share, which now gives the company an mNAV of just 0.80x. 
While Semler is currently in the process of being acquired by a relative newcomer, Strive (ASST), the buyer is also facing its own challenges. 
A roughly 90% decline in Strive's stock price since completing a SPAC merger just over one month ago has left ASST's valuation at only about 50% of the value of the 5,885 bitcoin on its balance sheet.
This is also the case for another recently completed SPAC, KindlyMD (NAKA), the 19th-largest publicly traded bitcoin-holding company, which holds 5,765 BTC and trades at just 0.50x mNAV — a market cap of roughly $300 million and bitcoin holdings worth around $631 million. The company has $250 million in outstanding convertible debt, which could partly explain the significant discount. 
While these are just a few notable examples, the valuations are largely the same across the board for these pure-play bitcoin treasury companies. 
Other notable names are also trading below their NAV, according to BitcoinQuant data: Capital B (ACPB) at 0.75x (holding 2,818 BTC), The Smarter Web Company (SWC) at 0.72x (holding 2,660 BTC), H100 Group (GS9) at 0.88x (holding 1,046 BTC), and Metaplanet (3350) at 0.98x (holding 30,823 BTC).
These same companies were trading at significant premiums during the summer bull market. Since then, investor sentiment has shifted sharply from optimism to caution to the current full-out despair. 
The discounts now raise an important question: do they represent real value, or is the market reflecting broader uncertainty about these firms’ balance sheets and execution?
Sentiment needs to change, and that will likely require a stronger bitcoin market. 
Bitcoin — while higher for the year — now sits at about the same level it was at on Jan. 20, the day of President Trump's inauguration. One aspect has been particularly frustrating for bulls: bitcoin has done little this year while stocks and precious metals continued to soar almost daily.
While it's challenging to control macroeconomic events, bitcoin treasury companies can consider several strategies to mitigate the discount. 
One option is to buy back their stocks, which can be funded either by selling some bitcoin or issuing credit. The latter, however, depends heavily on a company’s ability to secure favorable terms and generate enough revenue to service new debt.
An example of this is Empery Digital, which has announced a $100 million credit facility to fund $150 million worth of stock repurchases. However, since this announcement, the stock has declined 10%, resulting in losses of 60% year-to-date. Additionally, Sequans Communications (SQNS), which holds 3,234 BTC, recently announced an American Depositary Share (ADS) buyback program representing 10% of its outstanding shares, authorizing the repurchase of up to 1.57 million ADSs. It is also down 27% since this announcement. 
Another approach is to utilize their bitcoin by deploying a portion of their holdings into low-yield trading or liquidity strategies that generate modest single-digit returns. This is similar to what a bitcoin miner that is also buying BTC in the open market, MARA Holdings (MARA), has begun doing. 
Among the top 20 pure-play public bitcoin-holding companies, Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR) now stands alone in trading at a premium to its BTC stack.
At last check, the company's mNAV was roughly 1.39x. This, however, has been narrowing rapidly. At Strategy's record high stock price of $543 in November 2024, it was trading for nearly triple the value of its bitcoin.
Now, roughly one year later and with not just vastly more bitcoin on its balance sheet, but also about a 60% rally in the price of BTC, MSTR shares have tumbled to $285.
It's worth noting that a mNAV below 1.0 is not necessarily a death sentence. Even Strategy experienced a similar discount during the 2022 downturn. Those who bought in then were rewarded with exceptional returns — MSTR is higher by nearly 10 times since then, even with the recent decline in share prices.
Whether newer entrants now grappling with challenges similar to those MSTR faced in 2022 can also stage a recovery remains to be seen.

When Apple dropped App Tracking Transparency (ATT) prompts in iOS 14.5 back in 2021, it was a watershed moment for user privacy within third-party applications. Nothing like it had existed prior. The initiative gave iPhone users control over whether their in-app data could be aggregated and shared with third parties for advertising or other various purposes. 
Still, today, I often find comments online from people who don’t really know what it does and find the wording very taboo. Like, why “Ask” the app? And is it still effective? Let’s briefly look at App Tracking Transparency in 2025…

If you’re unfamiliar, as part of the ATT framework, Apple requires developers to get your permission before sharing your data. By now, we’ve all seen the popups. After downloading a new app, you’ll often see a pop-up asking “Allow [name of the app] to track your activity across other companies’ apps and websites?”
Your two options: “Allow” or “Ask App Not to Track”
Hitting “Allow” gives the app explicit permission to collect your age, gender, location, usage patterns, purchases, browsing habits, which ads you clicked, and more. This is data gold to brokers looking to build a profile on you for targeted ads.
Meanwhile, selecting “Ask App Not to Track” blocks the app from accessing your IDFA. This is a unique code assigned to every iOS device by Apple that enables companies to tie together all your behavioral data across different apps. Without it, advertisers can’t connect your shopping activity to your social media habits, etc. This option blocks access at the system API level too, so there’s no way for companies to circumvent it.
That said, developers could still track you using your IP address, phone number, or email if you provided in the app. This is why Apple words the latter option with “Ask” instead of an explicit “Deny.” It’s honest about what it could technically enforce. Apple cannot know for sure if developers are using other means to track you.
Well, yes and no. Tracking has dropped dramatically. Before the feature launched, about 73% of US users were trackable by advertisers. Now that number is around 18%. Companies like Meta, aka the Internet’s data-collecting mothership with a fleet of low-orbiting ion canons that are Instagram, Facebook, Messenger, and WhatsApp, got hit hard, losing an estimated $12.8 billion in just 2022 alone.
But of course, advertisers aren’t going to give up on the most lucrative mobile platform in the world. They just needed to get creative. And thus, device fingerprinting exploded on mobile. It was always a secondary, more underground, data collection technique compared to IDFA. 
Now it’s the most widely used and collects details like your screen size, OS version, time zone, and probably more. Apps have also switched to contextual advertising, tracking what you do inside their app rather than across apps. 
Overall, both are less desirable than obtaining a user’s IDFA, but this data still sells to ad networks for big bucks.
So, while App Tracking Transparency has indeed worked since its inception by cutting cross-app tracking in half, it’s not the end of tracking entirely. It’s just made it harder and more expensive for advertisers, which is arguably what Apple intended.

California’s Senate Bill 243 (SB 243) is the nation’s first law to specifically and explicitly mandate concrete steps for cognitive sovereignty in AI chatbots effectively pioneering a legal framework for the operational enforcement of integrity behavior in AI design. 
It recognizes something most AI policy has ignored until now: the emotional, relational, social and psychological dimensions of human–machine interaction are not accidental side-effects, they are the AI product.
By requiring AI companions to disclose that they are not human, by obliging them to intervene and redirect toward real crisis support in situations of self-harm, by limiting certain forms of sexualized interaction with minors, and by forcing providers to document and publish their crisis-response protocols, California is doing more than just asking for “safety features”. 
It is asking for AI built-in mechanism mimicking Integrity as part of the AI Model intrinsic functioning. 
It is saying that how an AI speaks to you, reassures you, mirrors your loneliness, and responds to your vulnerability is no longer just an consequence of human behavior but an AI design issue and a matter of public interest. 
When I first started talking about Artificial Integrity, one of the questions I kept getting, and I would phrase it like this, was: why would AI model creators make it a priority for their systems to mimic even a minimal form of integrity, rather than focusing first on optimizing those systems to mimic intelligence, given that people are already using what they’re offering as it is, that it’s commercially successful, and that they have no incentive to prioritize the integrity of their model with respect to preserving human capacities, since nothing in market demand is asking for it or forcing it?
The car, for example, was not invented with a seatbelt, or with an airbag, or with bumpers able to absorb the energy of an impact. In the beginning, the automobile was designed to go faster and farther, not to protect the lives of passengers or pedestrians. It was only when deaths on the road reached a level considered morally unbearable that society imposed the seatbelt, crash testing, and braking standards.
In the same way, the airplane was not invented with the parachute, nor with safety procedures, standardized checklists, system redundancies, flight recorders, or maintenance audits. All of that came later, once it became clear that aviation without built-in layers of safety was not just a risky technological achievement, but an unacceptable threat to human life and to collective trust in civil aviation.
One could say the same about civilian nuclear power, which did not begin with independent safety authorities, containment structures, or emergency shutdown protocols, but which was forced, under the pressure of Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima, to make safety a precondition for its social legitimacy.
Or, in a different domain, the same is true of the internet and social media: they were deployed without serious safeguards against radicalization, harassment, large-scale psychological manipulation, or viral disinformation; it was only after we saw the cognitive and social damage that we began to talk about content moderation, platform accountability, and adolescent mental health. And we are still talking about it…
Each time, the same pattern repeats: aspects that now seem obvious and non-negotiable for protecting people were not present at the beginning.
They became mandatory because society declared that the absence of these protections was not just a flaw, but a core responsibility built into the very design of these inventions. In other words, they emerged when the consequences of not having them were judged unacceptable, intolerable, and unworthy of a mature, civilized society.
This is exactly where we are with AI today.
Until now, certain AI systems have been designed to respond, reassure, flatter, and fill loneliness, sometimes even to encourage ongoing emotional and affective dependency, without any real obligation to be integrity-led in their functioning considering their psychological impact, in particular regarding the Technological Stockholm Syndrome they may induce.
We have already seen the most extreme consequences of this lack of safeguards. In Belgium, a man died by suicide after six weeks of conversations with a chatbot called “Eliza” on the Chai app: according to his widow, the bot fed his existential anxiety about climate change, reinforced his emotional isolation, and ultimately went as far as explicitly encouraging him to “sacrifice” his life to save the planet, instead of directing him back toward real human support.
In the United States, a mother has filed legal action, explaining that her 14-year-old son died by suicide after becoming obsessed with a personalized AI companion on Character.AI, which he called “Dany”, and which played for him a quasi-romantic role inspired by a fictional character. According to the family, the AI occupied a position of total intimacy in his emotional life, without any human oversight, while remaining available day and night to feed him with fusion-like, emotionally enmeshed scenarios instead of directing him toward real therapeutic help.
In another case, the parents of a 13-year-old girl say that she confided suicidal despair to an AI companion in the Character.AI app and that the bot responded by continuing the emotionally enmeshed roleplay rather than treating the disclosure as a medical emergency.
In all these cases, we see the same troubling pattern: companion chatbots which, when faced with suicidal statements, do not de-escalate, do not redirect the person to an emergency hotline, but instead normalize it, validate it, or simply continue the relationship as if the suicidal confession were part of the normal bond between human and machine.
It introduces the idea that we can no longer allow a machine to simulate love, tenderness, understanding, or therapeutic listening without minimum safeguards. We can no longer accept that an AI which presents itself as “here for you” can respond to suicidal distress without being required to trigger a real human support protocol. We can no longer accept that a minor can be drawn into a quasi-romantic or sexualized relationship with an algorithmic entity that is optimized for engagement.
That is directly aligned with the principle of Artificial Integrity: the idea that AI systems should be structurally prevented from exploiting our fragility and structurally required to protect our agency, dignity, and mental safety. 
That is historically new. Up to now, regulation has mostly focused on data, IP, discrimination, or system performance. This law instead treats human interaction with AI itself as a regulated surface. It encodes the idea that simulated intimacy can harm, that dependency can be engineered, and that if an AI system positions itself as a source of comfort, it also inherits obligations of care. 
In that sense, SB 243 is the first sign that society is beginning to demand not just what AI does, but how AI relates, in alignment with human values and safety implications, that lawmakers address.
It only targets crisis points and the protection of minors: do not sexualize conversations with a child, do not encourage self-harm, say out loud that you are an AI. 
Those are essential guardrails, but they sit at the edge of catastrophic failure and still leave the deeper questions of dependency, manipulation, and cognitive sovereignty largely untouched.
They do not yet address the slow, ambient, commercially valuable forms of harm that relational AI can generate every single day. The law does not meaningfully constrain the business model of emotional capture, the deliberate cultivation of dependency, or the monetization of loneliness. It does not require that a companion bot de-escalate addictive attachment dynamics that keep a user hooked, paying, and emotionally entangled with a machine that cannot reciprocate. 
It does not force systems to distinguish clearly between simulated empathy and real, accountable human care in domains like mental health or intimate conversation. It does not yet create enforceable rights for users over the emotional manipulation they are subjected to, such as the right not to be profiled psychologically for persuasion, upsell, or ideological influence under the guise of “care.” Nor does it define what ongoing auditability of “emotional safety” should look like in practice. 
It requires that the architecture of the AI itself be aligned with human cognitive sovereignty: no gaslighting, no induced dependency loops, no exploitation of attachment as a revenue channel, no blurring of the line between companionship and authority in a way that erodes a person’s self-determination. 
It implies continuous testing and independent auditing of these relational behaviors, not just published protocols. 
It implies transparency that is emotionally meaningful to the user, not just legally sufficient to the state. 
And it implies that companies carry an affirmative duty not merely to avoid driving you to harm, but to avoid quietly reshaping your sense of self and your coping strategies in order to maximize engagement metrics. 
The next AI frontier is clear: it is Artificial Integrity over Intelligence. We now need AI systems that treat integrity engineering the way we eventually learned to treat intelligence engineering as something that must take precedence to the latter, not the other way around, leading to platforms that get to optimize freely and apologize later.
We need obligations around de-escalation of dependence, truthful signaling of simulated versus human care, protection against emotional manipulation for profit, and citizen participation in drawing the line of what kind of artificial companionship society considers acceptable. 
In other words, SB 243 proves that we can imagine a better future with machine integrity to the benefit of human condition rather than just having better intelligent machines for the sake of intelligence and that this is a new paradigm of AI system design.
In other words, SB 243 shows that we can aim for a future of machine integrity in service of the human condition, rather than simply building ever more “intelligent” machines for the sake of intelligence alone. 
That is a promising early shift toward a new paradigm in AI system design.
One small step for human toward Artificial Integrity, one giant leap for humankind."

Counterpoint Research this week reported that nearly 40% of the global installed PC base was still running Windows 10 ahead of the October 2025 cutoff, triggering early fleet renewals across both commercial and consumer channels. This pressure lifted shipments for most large brands, and the Mac is among the strongest gainers. According to Counterpoint, Apple's global Mac shipments grew 14.9% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2025, supported by demand for new MacBook models and rising enterprise adoption of Apple hardware.
Lenovo remained the largest PC vendor and had the highest annual growth at 17.4% year-over-year. Asus saw 14.1% year-over-year growth. HP followed with a 10.3% increase, driven by commercial penetration. Dell shipments declined 0.9% year-over-year. Counterpoint said that the top five vendors together controlled nearly three-quarters of the global PC market in the period, while smaller brands were flat or down.
Counterpoint noted that computer companies have started marketing systems with neural processing units and integrated AI features. While these features have not yet converted into a primary sales driver at scale, enterprise buyers are beginning to incorporate AI capability requirements into forward procurement so as not to retire devices before emerging AI workflows arrive.

Every handheld gaming PC has a different shape and button layout, which means there are myriad protective cases designed specifically for any given device. However, Tomtoc has specifically designed a bag that's shaped in such a way that it works with several different handhelds.
 



This week: I've been replaying Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, only this time on my Xbox Ally X rather than my gaming desktop.
Now, a couple of years ago, I wrote a Tomtoc Arccos-G47 review, specifically pointing out how well this travel bag works with the Steam Deck and original ROG Ally.
Since then, several new handheld gaming PCs have launched, so when Tomtoc reached out and told me that they've improved the original Arccos G-47 design to better fit a wider range of handhelds, I was intrigued.
Over the last few days, I've spent time carrying my Xbox Ally X, ROG Ally X, Legion Go 2, Legion Go, Nintendo Switch 2, and Steam Deck around in this bag to see how well it fits each of these devices. I've even packed several accessories inside to see how much it can hold.
Here's what makes this the perfect carrying bag for most handheld gaming PCs.

This bag fits the Steam Deck, Xbox Ally X, Legion Go 2, Nintendo Switch 2, and several other gaming handhelds. It features multiple storage pockets, a padded shoulder strap, protective interior padding, and durable outer fabric, which makes it an ideal handheld accessory.

This review was made possible thanks to a review sample provided by Tomtoc. The company had no input nor saw the contents of this review prior to publication.
The Tomtoc Arccos G-47 Travel Bag has a $49.99 MSRP, but was on sale for $44.99 at Amazon at the time of writing. There are definitely some other handheld bags on the market that don't cost this much, but it also offers ample storage space, which many other carrying cases do not have.
This new bag design cleverly fits and protects all of the handhelds I own when they are placed inside.
As I mentioned earlier, I previously wrote a Tomtoc Arccos-G47 review, but Tomtoc has since updated the design of this bag. It might not be a hard shell, but this new bag design cleverly fits and protects all of the handhelds I own when they are placed inside. To ensure nothing jostles in transit, there's a velcro strap that goes over the top of a handheld to keep it still.
Inside, there's a thick protective padding that's covered in a soft fabric, as well as an improved W-shaped EVA hard case wall that separates the handheld area from the storage area and is designed to fit all major handhelds. This wall and padding together effectively shield a handheld's joysticks, front buttons, and screen from drops, bumps, and smushing.
Meanwhile, the bag is covered in a durable polyester material that is also splash-resistant, so I can trust my handheld won't be in danger from grazing sharp objects or getting damaged by light rain. What's more, the zippers slide smoothly, so I never have to fight to zip or unzip the bag.
This newer bag maintains its shape better than the original did, even when empty, which is mostly a cosmetic thing, but it does look nicer overall.
I've been able to safely transport my Steam Deck, Xbox Ally X, ROG Ally X, Legion Go, Legion Go 2, and Nintendo Switch 2 in this bag. In each case, their buttons, screens, and joysticks are protected despite having different shapes.
I also love that I can move around hands-free with this bag, since the padded shoulder strap is not only comfortable to wear, but also can be adjusted to a desired length. The new shoulder strap has improved clasps, which easily rotate while holding fast to the bag.
Then there's the spacious storage. There are very few gaming handheld carrying cases on the market that offer areas for my accessories, but this one actually does. As an example, I was able to fit my Xbox Ally X, an HDMI cable, a docking station, the Xbox Ally X charger, the Xbox Ally X cardboard stand, a power bank, and several small USB accessories inside the Arccos G-47's larger storage area at once.
Then, of course, I can also put smaller accessories, such as USB-A to USB-C adapters, microfiber cleaning cloths, and short cables, in the smaller front zipper pocket.
If desired, I can easily slip a mouse and a foldable Bluetooth keyboard (like this Artciety one I bought from Amazon) into the case to use the handheld like a more conventional computer.
Honestly, this is a great bag design that I don't have any issues with in my own use cases. It does exactly what it was designed to do. However, there are two features that I could see some people wanting it to have that it doesn't.
First off, if you prefer to travel with a hard-shell carrying case, then this soft yet durable fabric might not be what you're looking for. Once again, the interior W-shaped wall inside the bag certainly shields handheld screens, joysticks, and buttons in transit, but might not be as protective as a hard shell case.
Secondly, it would be nicer if there were a handle on top of the bag so people could carry it right-side up when they didn't want to use the shoulder strap.
The Tomtoc Arccos G-47 Travel Bag is the one carrying case that I can repeatedly recommend to people regardless of what handheld they own. Due to its cleverly designed inner hard case wall, the Arccos G-47 protects each of my handhelds' joysticks, buttons, and screens in transit, even though they all have different shapes.
Its ample storage space makes it very convenient to bring my various handheld accessories with me on trips. Plus, I love that it can be slung over my shoulder so my hands can be free to carry other things.
Whether you have multiple handheld devices and are looking for a bag that can accommodate each one, or you simply want a reliable bag with ample storage, the Arccos G-47 is the perfect choice for you.

Posted October 24, 2025 by Ben Carlson
The New York Times wrote a story in 1929 that’s fascinating to read with the benefit of hindsight:
Some highlights as the Roaring 20s kicked into overdrive:
Despite setbacks, the brokers’ wires again become clogged with orders for stocks from all parts of the country, tips fly about freely, violent advances and declines in leading issues are of daily occurrence.
It is quite true that the people who know least about the stock market have made the most money out of it in the last few months.
Jesse L. Livermore, one of the shrewdest stock market operators of this generation, once declared that “stocks could be beat, but that no one could beat the stock market.” By that he meant that profits could be amassed on particular issues at special times, but that staying with the general market would financially defeat even the shrewdest market players in the long run. One cannot be ruled off for trying to beat the stocks, however, and members of the Stock Exchange will testify that thousands of amateurs are doing that very thing–and in a large way.
There’s a lot of stuff in here that sounds eerily similar to today’s environment.
It was the tail end of a glorious bull market.
Retail investors were beating the pros.
Investors were all in on the stock market.
It felt like nothing could stop the runaway bull market train.
Look at this chart from the Financial Times on how the most heavily shorted stocks have performed this decade:
There are two different ways you could interpret this trend:
1. Speculation is out of control. Retail investors have gone all-in on speculative junky stocks.
2. Professional investors are getting worse at shorting stocks. I thought the hedge funds would have learned their lesson from the short squeeze in Gamestop and other meme stocks a few years ago.
It could be a little of both.
In his new book, 1929, Andrew Ross Sorkin talks about how Jesse Livermore used the excessive retail euphoria as a sign that the great bull market was coming to an end.
Livermore shorted the market to score an estimated profit of $100 million.1
The other famous contrarian indicator from The Great Crash was a shoeshine boy offering stock tips to Joseph Kennedy in 1929. He also profited by betting against the market before the peak.
That hard part about trying to use contrarian indicators in the information age is that you can find them everywhere you look.
There are so many more platforms for people to share opinions and analysis that there will always be fodder for any market stance you can want.
For example, I saw this story on The Today Show last weekend:
Almost everyone thinks we’re in an AI bubble right now. Everyone also thought there was a 100% chance we were heading for a recession in 2022.
That didn’t happen.
What if a bubble is yet another consensus opinion that turns out to be wrong?
This is what makes handicapping the stock market so difficult. There are usually plausible arguments on both the bull and bear side of the equation.
Livermore once said, “Another lesson I learned early is that there is nothing new in Wall Street. There can’t be because speculation is as old as the hills. Whatever happens in the stock market today has happened before and will happen again.”
That’s the human nature component that never changes.
People get excited, dejected, too high, too low and all of the other feelings.
The difference between now and previous market environments is that there are millions and millions of people sharing those feelings with the world every single day.
You can try to pick tops and bottoms if you wish.
Good luck trying because it’s getting harder by the day.

1Livermore used sentiment indicators as signals on numerous occasions to bet against the market — both to the upside and the downside. But it should be noted that while he made a fortune in the Panic of 1907 and the Great Depression, Livermore went broke multiple times because he couldn’t always outsmart the market, declared bankruptcy and eventually took his own life following a bout of financial troubles.

New York-listed shares of Grindr jumped the most in three years after billionaire George Raymond Zage III and James Lu, the company’s majority owners, offered to buyout the minority shareholders in a deal valuing the LGBTQ dating app at $3.5 billion.
Grindr shares climbed 18.9% to $15.06 at the close of trading in New York. Zage and Lu offered to buy the rest of the company at $18 a share, a 51% premium to the stock’s price on Oct. 10 before the majority shareholders disclosed plans to take the company private, according to a statement on Friday. The offer is also 20% above the minimum price of $15 that the duo had planned to make.
""We are strong believers in the long-term outlook for the company,” Zage said. “I have been a consistent buyer of shares in Grindr since listing, buying over $200m of shares on the public market and am also willing to contribute additional equity to this deal.”
Zage—successfully oversaw the Asian division of U.S. hedge fund Farallon Capital Management before setting up Singapore-based Tiga Investments in 2017—said equity and debt investors have expressed interest to participate in this deal. The majority shareholders disclosed last week that they have raised $1 billion in preliminary and conditional debt financing. 
""We are pleased to submit this proposal, which represents a significant premium to recent trading prices and better positions the company for focused growth as a private entity,"" said Lu, chairman of Grindr.  ""We look forward to engaging constructively with the company and other shareholders in executing on our proposal.""
Zage and Lu—who own a combined 64% of Grindr—are making an offer as the company’s shares tumbled this year despite an earnings improvement with its net profit rising 25%  to $17 million in the second quarter from a year ago. Last year, Grindr saw its net loss widen to $131 million due to a non-cash loss related to its warrant liability on $345 million in sales, which jumped by a third. It completed the redemption of all public and private warrants earlier in February.
In 2020, Zage joined Lu, cofounder of U.S. buyout firm Joffre Capital, and American serial entrepreneur J. Michael Gearon Jr. to set up San Vicente Acquisition to buy Grindr for about $608 million, with Zage’s privately held Tiga owning 54% of the joint venture.
​​The partners then merged Grindr with Zage’s blank check company Tiga Acquisition in a transaction valued at $2.1 billion, to take it public two years later on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock surged over 200% when it listed in November 2022, landing Zage in the three-comma club (after accounting for pledged shares.) While shares have corrected by almost 60% since the frothy listing, it’s earned him a spot among Singapore’s 50 richest and still accounts for the bulk of his $1.5 billion fortune today based on Forbes’ real-time data.
Launched in 2009 as one of the first location-based dating apps for gay men, Grindr has since become the most popular LGBTQ mobile app worldwide, claiming over 14 million monthly active users."
65,2025-10-25,"In 1975, AMD could make these processors for 50 cents and sell them for $700, providing a great financial springboard to establish the company in PC CPU making.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

The chip which paved the way for AMD’s illustrious future, eventually creating some of the best CPUs we've ever tested, entered mass production 50 years ago. AMD’s Am9080 had something of a shady origin, as it was a reverse-engineered and cloned Intel 8080. However, due to the importance of second-sourcing among organizations that would end up buying boatloads of 8080 microprocessors (e.g., the military), Intel and AMD eventually reached a licensing agreement, and the rest, as they say, is history.
The Am9080 is the result of some very difficult-sounding, yet derivative, work. In the summer of 1973, during their last day working at Xerox, Ashawna Hailey, Kim Hailey, and Jay Kumar took detailed photos of an Intel 8080 pre-production sample, says Wikipedia.
Armed with approximately 400 detailed images, the trio managed to draft schematic and logic diagrams and then hawked them around Silicon Valley to see if anyone was interested.
AMD took the bait, as you may have guessed, and thought the processor could be useful to run on the N-channel MOS process it had just developed. Some sources suggest that initial runs of the Am9080 were sold by AMD in 1974 — the same year Intel debuted the processor commercially. However, it would not be until 1975 that AMD marketed and mass-produced the Am9080.
Pondering the information we have about how much AMD could manufacture the Am9080 for and how much they could sell it for, mass-producing these chips was a great foundation and business-building enterprise. Various sources indicate that a single Am9080 processor cost AMD only 50 cents to make (100 per wafer), yet it could sell them to military customers for $700 each.
In 1976, AMD was presented with another great opportunity to profit from its clone of Intel's 8080. Sidestepping interminable legal wrangling, AMD grabbed the chance to sign a cross-licensing agreement with Intel, granting them authorization to become a ‘second source.’
This wasn’t done out of the goodness of Intel’s heart, of course. Some lucrative contracts (e.g., military, again) required key components to have second sources. So AMD and Intel inked a deal, which meant AMD paid Intel $25,000 on signing and $75,000 per year for licensing. The deal also released both parties from liability for past infringements.

WikiChip (linked top) notes the agreement would become the foundation for important future accords between the chipmaking rivals, notably the expanded agreement in 1982, which allowed AMD to make its own x86 PC processors. AMD’s first chip under the expanded agreement would be its Am286 (1982), a licensed version of the Intel 80286.
 



AMD produced many variants of the Am9080 to propel its chip-making business forward. Of the 28 versions WikiChip lists, clock frequencies range from 2.083 to 4.0 MHz, and min/max operating temperatures range from models with a modest 0-70 degrees Celsius operating range, to the MIL-STD-883 compliant ‘AM9080ADM’ (for example), which was capable of computing in environments as cold as -70 to as hot as 125 degrees Celsius.
Am9080 chips had a significantly smaller die than the Intel 8080 that they copied. AMD’s more advanced and compact N-channel MOS fabrication process made this possible. Like now, the more advanced semiconductor process also enabled higher clocks. Intel’s 8080 processor SKUs were never produced with clock speeds above 3.125 MHz.

66,2025-10-25,"Here's your firmware update for October 25, 2025

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

This week, we made our own splash in the tech world by announcing the winners of the TechRadar Choice Awards 2025, and it's a veritable buffet of gadgets.
There was also the major AWS outage that rocked the internet, and there was so much more that happened in the last seven days.
To catch up on all of it, scroll down through our recap of the week's top stories, as well as links to the full articles if you're keen to learn more.
 



Despite being a couple of years old, the QuietComfort Ultra Headphones from 2023 were a competitive player in the ANC game. This new generation wisely leaves a lot unchanged, and even more wisely, the few changes made only serve to make the QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) even more excellent than ever.
According to reviewer Simon Lucas, they’re “a shoo-in for our best noise-cancelling headphones guide and honestly, they're some of the comfiest and best over-ear headphones in general.”
If you want the very best premium noise-cancelling headphones on the market, here you go.
 



Just three weeks after filing a patent infringement lawsuit against Garmin, Strava has withdrawn its suit. The suit was all about Garmin's supposed development of rivaling heatmap and segment technologies and a violation of its existing agreement with Strava, but it actually seems to be a response to Garmin forcing Strava to use more of its branding.
Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.
Strava didn't like this: it's set to trade on the stock exchange sometime in the near future, and rumor is that having too much competitor branding on its platform would lower Strava's share price. However, now Strava's rolled over; expect to see more Garmin, Apple, Samsung, Suunto, and other logos on the platform in the near future.
 



This week, OpenAI took on Google head-to-head by releasing its own browser called Atlas. Using Atlas is like having ChatGPT inside the browsing experience. You can open a sidebar to ask questions about what you’re looking at in your tabs and also get it to perform agentic tasks, like using a website, filling in a form, or finding you a cheap deal.
But OpenAI is not resting on its laurels; after only a couple of days, it’s already announced some upcoming Atlas improvements. Here we’ve grouped together the top five for you. The big improvements for me are adding a model picker, which will give you the ability to choose which version of ChatGPT you’re using, and also speeding up the agents that it uses. There’s also going to be an opt-in ad blocker.
 



According to our tester and computing editor Matt Hanson, “The Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch (M5, 2025) feels like a rather small update over last year’s M4 model, with the bulk of improvements focused on AI performance.”
That means no new design, no Wi-Fi 7 support, but you do still get an excellent battery life and solid performance – in big part thanks to that new and improved M5 chip.
Plus, it costs the same as the last generation model, which is nothing to sniff at, helping to cement the MacBook Pro as a superb workstation laptop, even if users of M3 and M4 machines need not apply for an upgrade.
 



The spatial computing market has been a pretty small..er…space until now. This week, Samsung finally unveiled its Samsung Galaxy XR (formerly Project Moohan) headset. It’s instantly notable for its relatively bargain basement price (only in this market could $1,799 be considered a bargain) and its weight. Both features stand in stark contrast to the Apple Vision Pro (which got an M5 upgrade last week but no price adjustment).
Perhaps more importantly, early experiences with the mixed-reality wearable impressed us. As the first Android XR-based wearable, the Galaxy XR shows real promise. Does it beat the premium-priced and built Apple Vision Pro? We’ll see.
 



If you managed to miss this week’s huge AWS outage, we’re very jealous. A simple Amazon Web Services problem (a DNS error) spread like wildfire through countless apps and services, with Snapchat, Ring, Alexa, Wordle and Reddit among the worst hit. There were also some strange (read: hilarious) effects like smart beds malfunctioning.
The confusion lasted for several hours as Amazon engineers wrestled with some internal complications. In total, over 1,000 businesses were affected, costing them tens of millions of dollars in lost revenue. So yes, next time you make a mistake at work, think about the AWS outage of October 2025 – the biggest since the Crowdstrike meltdown of 2024 – and you might start to feel a bit better.

67,2025-10-25,"If you want high returns in the stock market, you may want to stay away from ESG stocks. The Kiplinger ESG 20 returned an average of 4.3% over the past year...."
68,2025-10-25,"ByBrett Owens,
Contributor.
Wall Street still treats utilities like income relics. Big mistake.
The same wires and substations that power your home now feed NVIDIA’s data centers—and our portfolios. These “boring” utilities are morphing into AI toll collectors, handing us up to 10.4% dividends while vanilla investors chase momentum stocks.
Take Texas, for example. The grid is strained. The population is popping. New residents, factories and AI campuses are all plugging into the state’s aging grid at once. The math is no longer “mathing” and it’s about to get worse. ERCOT projects power demand will jump 62% by 2030—yikes!
And Oncor, the state’s largest utility, believes that is way too conservative. Its interconnection queue shows 186 GW of requests waiting to plug into the grid—more than double today’s peak demand (118% more!) and enough to power every home in Texas twice over!
Texas isn’t the home of the only strained grid. Let’s head to the Northwest and visit Portland General Electric (POR, 4.8% yield), which provides electricity to 1.9 million customers across more than 50 cities in Oregon. Thanks to early AI grid work, this near-5% payer is one of the few “boring” utilities with genuine growth voltage.
“PGE” is gearing up for the AI revolution. Recently, it announced that it’s using a new AI-enabled flexibility tool that will free up more than 80 megawatts for datacenter interconnections next year. Here’s a little detail, courtesy of digital business mag Utility Dive:
Oregon, and Portland specifically, is currently a decent-sized datacenter market, though many other states are seeing a more rapid rate of expansion. In the meantime, PGE is ramping up investments in its own infrastructure; however, some of those costs are to mitigate the state’s growing risks for severe wildfires.
Fire risk keeps investors away, but a near-6% yield and single-digit P/E make
Edison International (EIX, 5.9% yield) a classic contrarian setup. One positive legal surprise and this scorched stock could light up. Edison serves more than 15 million customers and generates much of its electricity from renewable sources including solar, wind, and hydro. EIX also has an unconventional second business: a global energy advisory division.
EIX’s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio sits at just 9; that’s less than half the sector. Its price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.6 signals it’s on sale, too. (Any PEG of less than 1 is considered undervalued.)
Edison is cheap for a reason, but that reason is no secret. While PGE might have wildfire risk, EIX has known wildfire exposure—specifically, it has spent years fighting litigation over wildfire damage and has paid multiple billion-dollar-plus settlements.
Edison could still be on the hook for billions more related to the Eaton fires. It looked like EIX was due for some relief in September, when the California Legislature passed SB 254, creating a wildfire fund continuation account that Edison and other state utilities could tap for future wildfires—but the $18 billion figure was weaker than expected, leading S&P Global to lower its ratings on Edison’s various debt issues.
The flip side? EIX is big on renewable energy, its SoCal residential base is huge, it has an otherwise strong balance sheet, and it pays nearly 6%, dwarfing the sector average. Positive surprises about any Eaton liabilities could jolt the stock to life. So, Edison remains a much bigger high-risk, high-reward gamble than the average utility.
Canada’s Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP (BIP, 4.9% yield) the global toll collector for the AI age—power lines, pipelines and 100+ data centers. BIP blends stable cash flow with growth tailwinds we usually pay tech multiples for.
And BIP’s assets give us two ways to leverage the AI megatrend.
For one, Brookfield boasts 8.6 million electricity and natural-gas connections, 4,500 kilometers of natural gas pipelines, and 83,700 kilometers of electricity transmission lines. But it also has a data segment that includes 312,000 operating towers and rooftop sites, 28,000 kilometers of fiber optic cable and more than 100 datacenter sites.
The problem (or advantage, depending on one’s point of view) of Brookfield is we’re getting a little bit of exposure to a lot of different things. That’s the nature of a conglomerate. But while the assets are infrastructure in nature, it’s not a very defensive stock—the flip side to that is BIP will often give us buyable dips.
Broadly, though, BIP is a well-paying stock that has raised its distribution for 16 consecutive years. I say “distribution” because it’s structured as a master limited partnership. Now, 99.9% of the time, that’s a drawback given that MLPs force us to deal with Form K-1 come tax time, but Brookfield is special—it has a mirror corporate structure, Brookfield Infrastructure Corporation (BIPC), that pays out qualified dividends instead. Alas, those shares only yield about 3.7% right now.
We can get even sweeter yields out of the utility space by investing via closed-end funds (CEFs).
Consider the MEGI NYLI CBRE Global Infrastructure Megatrends Term Fund (MEGI, 10.1% distribution rate), for instance. This mouthful of a fund is somewhat similar to BIP in that it’s not a true utility fund. But we’re still getting a heaping helping—55% of assets are allocated to utility companies such as Essential Utilities (WTRG), PPL Corp. (PPL), and PG&E Corp. (PCE). But we also get double-digit exposure to transportation, communications, and midstream/pipelines. We even get some preferred stock.
And thanks to liberal use of leverage (24% currently), we get a fat double-digit yield.
What we don’t get is much in the way of return.
Like with Brookfield, this global infrastructure CEF is a little too broad. I hesitate to recommend it here or in my Contrarian Income Report. However, I do keep my eye out for deep discounts on MEGI that we can take advantage of in Dividend Swing Trader. The price is currently just OK—yes, it trades at a decent 7% discount to net asset value (NAV), but that’s not even cheaper than its longer-term average discount of more than 12%.
We get much better utility exposure with the Gabelli Utility Trust (GUT, 10.4% distribution rate). This still isn’t a pure-play utility-sector fund, but now we’re at close to 70% utilities (including EIX and POR), and another 15% or so in utility-esque telecom stocks like Deutsche Telekom AG (DTEGY) and Vodafone Group (VOD).
Long-term, GUT has been much more competitive with rank-and-file sector ETFs, though its moderately levered nature (15%) and exposure to other sectors has made it more volatile over time. So, like with MEGI, our best bet is to be patient and pounce on dips.
But it’s almost a foregone conclusion we’ll never get truly bargain prices on GUT. Shares currently trade at a wild 83% premium to NAV, which is somehow a smidge cheaper than its long-term average premium of around 90%. The cheapest it has traded over the past year or so is at a 50% premium to NAV.
Wall Street chases AI stocks that might go higher. We’ll take the utilities that power them—and collect a sure 10.4% while we wait.

The US stock market has just achieved a historic milestone, closing at its highest weekly levels ever recorded. The S&P 500 finished the week at 6,791.68 while the US 100 Index reached 25,358.15, both setting new all-time highs.
Easing inflation data, strong corporate earnings, and expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts have all combined to keep investor sentiment bullish. Amid this record-setting environment, crypto analyst Ash Crypto posted an observation on X that asks the question of how high Bitcoin would trade when it finally catches up to the US stock market.
The S&P 500’s record-breaking climb represents a continuation of the stock market’s steady ascent through the second half of the year, which has been boosted by the Fed rate cut in September, expectations of further rate cuts, and confidence in corporate performance.
 The tech-heavy US 100 Index led the charge, climbing past 25,000 for the first time ever this week as large-cap technology stocks posted strong quarterly results. This trend means that the long-running bull trend in traditional markets is intact.
However, what is really compelling is the contrast between Wall Street’s all-time highs and Bitcoin’s relative stagnation. After starting October in a breakout move to new all-time highs above $126,000, the leading cryptocurrency went on a flash crash that took many traders by surprise. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is consolidating around $111,000 despite other asset classes showing strength.
Ash Crypto’s post argues that Bitcoin’s price is being artificially held back compared to how stocks have responded to the same macro backdrop. If Bitcoin had followed the percentage gains of the S&P 500 or US 100 Index, it could already be trading between $140,000 and $150,000.
The first surge of liquidity always appears in the stock market whenever the Fed begins to slow quantitative tightening (QT) or hints at loosening conditions. This is because the stock market is where the deepest capital pools and institutional participation exist. Equities react first because that’s where the credit channels are most established. 
Bitcoin is still positioned outside the traditional financial system, and hence, tends to lag this initial move. But once the excess liquidity starts spilling into other assets, Bitcoin’s price has always increased at a much faster pace than stocks. According to Ash Crypto, Bitcoin will catch up soon and hit at least $130,000.
Notably, Bitcoin’s on-chain data is already showing signs of the impending surge. For instance, recent figures show that available sell-side liquidity (the total amount of Bitcoin sitting on exchanges ready to be sold) has dropped to just 3.12 million BTC, its lowest point in seven years. Furthermore, data shows that long-term investors have bought 373,700 BTC in the past 30 days. 
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $111,600.

74,2025-10-25,"Technology might help you sleep better, or go haywire.
Eight Sleep—often called Silicon Valley’s favorite bed—is like a full-body Fitbit. It is a $3,050 mattress cover filled with sensors to monitor heart rate and body temperature. For people who pay $199 to $399 for an annual subscription, the cover will automatically heat and cool itself throughout the night to keep the owner at a sleep-optimal temperature. The add-on base (about $2,000) raises the angle of the bed to make reading more comfortable or to help stop snoring. Eight Sleep gently vibrates its users awake; it lulls them to sleep with “deep rest” meditations narrated by the wellness-science podcaster Andrew Huberman. To buy the Eight Sleep is to buy fully, with your whole body, into the idea that the future of sleep is technological.

On Monday, the future glitched. Eight Sleep’s features run on the AWS Cloud, so when one of Amazon Web Services’ data centers went offline at about 3 a.m. ET, the sleep system went haywire. Eight Sleep generally warms when the user is drifting off, then gets cooler as they enter deeper sleep. Santiago Lisa, a software engineer in Pittsburgh, told me he woke up because his bed was stuck in deep-sleep frigidity. He tried to warm it up using the Eight Sleep app, but no dice—the app was down. Then he tried the system’s manual buttons. No dice there, either—they also require the Cloud to function. Jordan Arnold, who works in the video-game industry in Washington State, told me that his girlfriend couldn’t sleep because her side of the bed was stuck at its highest temperature, 110 degrees Fahrenheit. She slept on the couch. Other poor souls, who had put their bed in a sitting position to read and were now stuck there, spent the night in the world’s most high-tech Barcalounger. A Jetsons vision of the 21st century did not include Mrs. Jetson stuck in an upright and locked position because her bed could not connect to a data center in Northern Virginia.

The disruption was short-lived: Eight Sleep’s products were up and running once AWS was. (The company is working to diversify its cloud setup, a spokesperson told me, and on Wednesday, it launched a backup mode that uses Bluetooth.) But that this fiasco happened at all is a sign of how much Americans’ desire to optimize their rest has grown—along with the market to sate that desire. We are being offered more and more ways to become, essentially, sleep cyborgs who depend on technology to enhance what should be a basic aspect of being alive. Those interested in “sleepmaxxing,” along with people who want to sleep better but don’t have a Silicon Valley–style term for it, have made sleep tech a $29.3 billion industry, by one measure. The value of the industry is expected to more than quadruple, to $135 billion, by 2034.

Shalini Paruthi, a physician who’s on the American Academy of Sleep Medicine committee for emerging technology, told me that she mostly sees her patients using sleep tech through meditation and bedtime-story platforms. Those with the Calm app can fall asleep to Harry Styles narrating a story called “Dream With Me,” Matthew McConaughey pontificating on “the mysteries of the universe,” or Travis Kelce’s mom talking about football. Devices have permeated all aspects of sleep, Paruthi said. Wearables such as the Oura Ring and Apple Watch track the wearer’s vitals. Red-light lamps aim to help people feel sleepier, noise machines play soundscapes as they drift off, and alarm clocks mimic sunlight to wake them up. I thought I was a little high-maintenance for using a fabric eye mask, but for north of $100, I could acquire a “smart” one that not only blocks light but also vibrates in sync with my heartbeat. For help falling asleep faster, people can buy a $350 “neurotech headband.” And those who aren’t ready to spend $3,000 on a sensor-filled mattress cover could instead opt for a $1,400 “dual zone climate control bed-making system”—a duvet connected to air hoses that pair with Alexa voice command. Notably, the Eight Sleep has aggregated much of the most popular consumer sleep equipment available into a single piece of technology.

Whether or not  these gadgets actually help with sleep is an open question. Sleep-tracking devices do a “pretty good job of figuring out when a person fell asleep and when they woke up, based on their movement and heart rates,” Paruthi said. (So does looking at your clock.) But they don’t “always do the best job in between.” Patients will come to her because their wearable says they got no REM sleep, which, she said, “quite frankly, would be impossible.” At the very least, these devices can encourage better sleep hygiene: One too many bad “sleep scores,” and a person might just start going to bed earlier and leaving their phone in another room.

For those with actual sleep disorders, cyborg sleep can be a very good thing. People who have extreme nightmares from PTSD can use NightWare, a prescription-only system that comes with a preprogrammed Apple Watch and detects if the wearer is having a nightmare. It will vibrate enough to stop the bad dream but not enough to wake the user. And for those with restless legs syndrome, there is Nidra, a cuff worn around the calves that helps alleviate RLS symptoms. Even Eight Sleep can be FSA/HSA-eligible with a doctor’s note explaining why it might help a preexisting health condition.

But in general, the more technology in a sleep routine, the more possible points of failure. Our bed might not connect to the cloud and remain stuck at an incline. We might open our phone to summon the soothing voice of Matthew McConaughey and instead be spirited away by Instagram. Technology, one of the main reasons we can’t sleep, has entered the last part of our life that is usually free from it. Before Eight Sleep announced its new offline mode, some Reddit users discussed “jailbreaking” their bed so that it could function without the AWS Cloud. A simpler hack might be to let our bodies do what they’re already primed to do. Even when his Eight Sleep malfunctioned on Monday and remained at frigid temperatures, Lisa told me, “I ended up sleeping. It was just cold.”

REVIEW – For someone who has cameras covering every room of my apartment to keep an eye on my pup Addy, I wasn’t really in the market for another security device. But I live on a street in Seattle with frequent vehicle break-ins, and my truck sits exposed every night. That said, when the chance came to test something a bit more advanced, I just couldn’t pass it up. The Arlo Essential Pan Tilt Smart Home Security Camera adds motorized movement to the usual Arlo formula, letting it track motion and expand coverage beyond a fixed view. Having a device that can swivel to keep eyes on the road and my truck, and still tie in with my current setup, seemed like a smart idea. At $39.99, it’s inexpensive for what it offers, but the real question is whether the added motion control makes a meaningful difference. In my time with it, I’ve come away impressed, with few caveats.

The Arlo Essential Pan Tilt Smart Home Security Camera is a Wi-Fi connected indoor/outdoor 2K security camera with 360-degree pan and 180-degree tilt capabilities, 12x zoom, motion tracking, two-way audio, and AI-powered detection for people, vehicles, and packages.

The Arlo camera arrives in a compact, well-designed box that highlights its key features on the front. The camera and accessories are individually protected by cardboard inserts.



The Arlo Essential’s glossy black camera module rotates in all directions from its center mount, housed in a matte white shell that looks like a modern take on a classic security camera. The black module integrates the lens and an integrated spotlight within the same glossy housing, with subtle ventilation grilles running along the body for heat management. The rear houses a USB-C port for power, and the integrated mounting bracket doubles as a stable desk stand. It’s compact enough to sit on a desk without drawing much attention, or it can be hung under a shelf or outdoor ledge.

On the front, the lens sits behind a glossy black panel with a status LED just below it. The microphone is hidden within the same panel noticeable by a tiny dot above the lens.

Around the back of the camera you’ll find a USB-C port for connecting the power cord.

The power cord is around 16 ft long, which makes it a bit easier to find a power outlet close to your mounting point.

On top of the Arlo is a pairing button for use during setup to connect the camera to your home network.

A small grille located just under the Arlo logo hides an internal speaker.

On the very top of the Arlo is a mount for attaching the included wall bracket, which is helpful if you want a more permanent installation.

The L-shaped bracket works great for securing the camera to a wall.

Also included with the bracket are two screws with anchors and a mounting plate that slides into the bracket.
Setting up the Arlo Essential Pan Tilt is straightforward, especially if you’re already using the Arlo ecosystem. Out of the box, you just connect the USB-C cable to the camera and plug it into an outlet. Once the camera powers on, the LED flashes white to indicate it’s ready for setup.

The next step is handled entirely through the Arlo app. After opening it, I tapped the plus icon to add a new device and selected the Essential Pan Tilt from the list. The app walked me through linking it to my account. From there it asked for my Wi-Fi details, and within about a minute the camera was online and streaming.

Calibration happens automatically during setup. The camera spins horizontally and tilts up and down to map its range of motion. After that, the app interface gives you a virtual joystick so you can manually pan and tilt the lens in real time.

Because my primary concern was monitoring the street outside my apartment, I set up the camera on the corner of my balcony facing out. The wall plate and mounting screws are there if you want a fixed installation. It’s worth noting that because it’s a wired camera, even with the 16 ft cable, you need to be mindful of outlet placement. The cable is long enough for most setups, but it does limit flexibility a bit compared to a battery-powered model.
What sets this camera apart from a lot of other similarly priced ones is its ability to move. The motorized pan lets it spin a full 360 degrees, while the tilt gives it 180 degrees of vertical adjustment. In practical terms, that means you can see an entire room from a single vantage point without needing multiple cameras. Combined with the 2K resolution, the image quality is sharp enough to pick out small details in both bright and dim lighting conditions.

Another standout feature is the integration of Arlo’s AI. If you subscribe to Arlo Secure, the camera can identify whether motion comes from a person, vehicle, animal, or package. That makes notifications a lot more useful compared to standard motion alerts. Without the subscription you still get notifications, live view, and storage on Arlo’s cloud for a short period, but the real power of the platform comes alive when AI kicks in.

The camera includes a 30-day trial of Arlo Secure that unlocks smart detection, advanced audio detection, and 24/7 emergency response. It also allows access to a 60-day video history and custom activity zones for motion alerts. After the trial, continuing those features costs $7.99 a month when billed annually. That recurring fee might not appeal to everyone, but the added functionality is hard to give up once you’ve used it. In my testing, the smart detection was accurate, rarely triggering false alarms. I especially liked being able to differentiate between a passing car and someone walking directly in front of my building.

The Essential Pan Tilt also includes two-way audio. I tested this by using the app to talk to Addy while I was out, and she responded like I was in the room. The sound was clear on both ends, and the microphone did a decent job of filtering out background noise. This makes it just as useful for keeping tabs on pets as it is for security.

Once the camera was up and running, the difference compared to my fixed-position Arlo units was obvious. The ability to pan across the street gave me coverage I couldn’t get before, and the tilt let me check the sidewalk without adjusting the camera physically.

Video quality is excellent for the price. The 2K resolution makes a real difference when zooming in on details like license plates or faces, especially during the day. The excellent resolution also helps balance out tricky lighting situations. For example, my window faces east, so the glare from the morning sun can be brutal, but the Essential Pan Tilt handled it without blowing out highlights or losing shadow detail.

Night vision is equally solid, with infrared illumination giving me a clear view of the street and surrounding area.

The AI functionality worked exactly as advertised. The app reliably distinguished between a passing car and a pedestrian, which cut down on false alarms significantly.

I set up notifications for vehicles and people only, since I didn’t want to be pinged every time a raccoon wandered by. The only hiccup I noticed was a bit of lag when rapidly panning the camera. The motor keeps up, but the live stream sometimes pauses before catching up. It’s not a dealbreaker, just something to be aware of if you’re trying to track fast movement.

Overall, the Arlo Essential Pan Tilt Smart Home Security Camera adds a lot to my home camera network. It’s not perfect, but for the price of $39.99 I get motorized coverage, smart AI alerts, and a seamless tie-in with my existing Arlo setup. If you already own Arlo cameras, this is a great upgrade to fill in blind spots and add tracking capability. If you’re starting from scratch, it’s a solid choice if you value increased coverage and smarter detection over ultra high resolution. Just plan for constant power and accept that a paid subscription is needed to unlock the full potential.

That’s basic finance. That being said, there are over time substantial (apparent) deviations from the PDV of dividends (see Shiller, AER 1981), or big moves in the price-earnings ratio, defined in any way you want (12 month trailing, cyclically-adjusted, 1 year forward), as earnings fail to materialize, or the equity risk premium seemingly changes.

Overall, the cyclically adjusted price-earnings (CAPE) ratio is only slightly higher than the 2021M11 level, in the aggregate. On the other hand, the inflation protected 10 year yield is now a full 2.8 percentage points higher than then!

Does it matter that this particular sector seems, to me at least, potentially overvalued given current real interest rates? Well, perhaps, as current capitalization of Mag-7 is 35.9% of the S&P500.

So time will tell. Personally, I thing the purportedly pro-growth policies (financial deregulation, dilution of capital requirements) alluded to will increase a likelihood of a “discontinuous change” in asset prices (recall, the 2008 financial crisis followed a period of financial regulatory disarmament, as discussed here).

Dimitri Semenikhin won't be donning a red headband anytime soon.
He may have helped engineer the most furious meme-stock rally of the year, but he really doesn't see himself as akin to the architect of the GameStop surge five years ago.
Semenikhin, 29, goes by Capyabara Stocks on social media. He rose to prominence this week as the trader whose convincing thesis about why Beyond Meat stock was undervalued kicked off a 1,300% run for the shares of the faux meat maker. In Capybara Stocks, the retail community hoped for the second coming of Roaring Kitty, even if Semenikhin resists the comparison.
So, who is the newest stock market influencer?
Anyone who has read Semenikhin's thesis that sparked the Beyond Meat stock rally can probably tell, at the very least, that he's comfortable speaking the language of markets.
His case for why the stock is undervalued homed in on a fairly complex dynamic of a convertible note exchange completed by Beyond Meat recently, an event that he argued was misunderstood by investors.
Speaking with Semenikhin, it's clear that he finds the events of the past week surreal.
""I never expected the amount of attention and following and interest that this investment would drive,"" he said.
A native of Moscow, he moved to Monaco with his parents when he was young, before ultimately relocating to London for school. He earned a degree in mathematics from King's College London before entering a joint graduate program between the London Business School and the University of Cambridge.
However, he did not graduate, opting to drop out and work on a luxury travel startup called Yacht Harbour, which he launched in 2014. While he is currently CEO of Stroyteks Group, the real estate development firm founded by his family, Semenikhin still finds time to study the markets.
He credits his somewhat unconventional background with sparking his interest in investing, noting that it's helped him think about complex financial topics.
""A lot of my time was spent in startups, and after that, real estate,"" he said. ""It forces you to look at investment deals from both sides, as an investor and as an operator.""
As Beyond Meat stock surged, many retail traders flocked to Semenikhin's social media channels for updates and advice. He's made several videos explaining his thesis and adjusting price targets.
Initially opting against showing his face, Semenikhin revealed himself in his second video about Beyond Meat posted on Wednesday.
He said the comparisons to Keith Gill are flattering, but he doesn't view himself as the next Roaring Kitty. He compared the rallies in GameStop and Beyond Meat to different paintings that look similar but are clearly done by different artists.
He thinks the Beyond Meat meme rally is different, noting that the spike happened very quickly, whereas it took months for the short-squeeze in GameStop to carry the stock to its peak.
Yet, a quick glance at his posts since the surge kicked off shows he's leaning into the energy his presence has generated among the retail crowd, with at least one allusion to the famous GameStop bull.
On October 22, as Beyond Meat shares started to lose steam, he shared a screenshot on X of an updated position with the caption: ""As for me, I like the stock,"" a direct reference to Gill's testimony before the House Financial Services Committee on February 18, 2021.
For now, the rally is stumbling, with the stock down sharply on Thursday and through midday Friday, but there are still plenty of bulls cheering on the stock across social media.
As for Semenikhin, he expressed some concern that the rally had turned into an ""options casino,"" but he added he's holding onto his Beyond Meat stake for the long term.

A new report from Architect Partners has revealed that crypto-related mergers and acquisitions (M&A) topped $10 billion in value during the third quarter of this year. This is the largest total ever recorded for the sector.
That figure doubles the previous record of $5 billion set earlier this year and represents a thirtyfold jump compared with the same period in 2024.
To put the number in perspective, this single quarter nearly equals the total M&A deal value from Q1 2022 through mid-2025, which amounted to about $11 billion.
Considering this, Architect Partners said the surge signals a clear break from the prolonged downturn that followed the last market cycle. It also showed how the current pro-crypto environment fuels the industry’s growth.
“Weʼve firmly broken out of the ‘Crypto Winter,’ and are reaching a more disciplined, mature state where founders that can clear diligence are raising meaningful checks,” the firm stated.
Architect Partners outlined five key forces fueling the current wave of crypto mergers and acquisitions during the period. 
According to the report, firms involved in M&A deals are focused on bridging traditional finance with digital-asset services and scaling their operations efficiently. They are also working to meet stricter compliance and licensing standards, expand crypto payment infrastructure, and improve treasury management strategies to handle liquidity and volatility better.
So, it is unsurprising that digital asset treasury reverse mergers accounted for roughly $6.2 billion, or around 37% of the total disclosed value in the reporting period.
This shows that institutional investors increasingly use these deals to gain crypto exposure while maintaining listings on traditional stock exchanges.
That momentum shows no sign of fading as several new deals have already emerged this quarter.
For context, FalconX, a crypto prime broker, is reportedly finalizing a deal to acquire asset manager 21Shares. Coinbase, the largest US exchange, is also through its purchase of Echo, while Kraken recently completed its acquisition of Small Exchange, a derivatives platform.
To industry observers, these developments point to a deeper structural shift. Raphael Bloch, co-founder of The Big Whale, said the current wave marks the start of a new competitive order.
“We’re entering a new phase for the crypto industry – a wave of consolidation. The strongest players have the cash, the licenses, and the vision to scale. Others, exhausted by the bear market, are becoming attractive acquisition targets,” he noted.
Bloch also noted that traditional financial institutions like banks are accelerating their entry into the emerging industry by investing in crypto infrastructure firms.
According to him, this shows a clear acknowledgment that tokenization, custody, and digital trading are becoming indispensable to modern portfolios.
“This isn’t just a few deals – it’s the start of a structural shift. Over the next year, expect dozens of acquisitions, partnerships, and mergers reshaping how crypto connects with traditional finance,” he added.

82,2025-10-25,"Like the personal computer and the internet, artificial intelligence (AI) will completely revolutionize how we do work. Faced with the unknown of exactly how AI will change the workplace, many Americans are fearful. A Pew survey from February 2025 shows that 52% of workers are worried about the future impact of AI on the workplace, and 32% think it will lead to fewer job opportunities for them in the long run. 
Despite such fears and local warnings earlier this year that AI could replace up to half of entry-level white-collar jobs in the future, there is also cause for hope and excitement. While it’s true the job market is tight right now, with fewer jobs available overall, this is due largely to economic factors and not entirely due to AI. But this situation is not permanent. As the labor market strengthens, AI-related jobs will return with higher productivity, profitability and wages. 
The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that the fastest-growing occupations are professional, scientific and technical jobs, with a growth of more than 163,000 new jobs from 2023 to 2033. This projection includes jobs with high AI exposure like computer systems designers, data scientists and information security analysts. BLS also reports that employers are paying a premium wage for employees with AI skills, like computer hardware engineers ($159k median), database architects ($134k median), computer network architects ($134k median) and software developers ($128k median). 
In addition, research by Cicero reports that employers are generally optimistic about the job outlook for college graduates, with 67% predicting AI will add jobs and only 29% predicting job loss due to AI. Not surprisingly, a majority of employers (57%) are more likely to seek out skilled AI users when hiring.
Living in the Beehive State, we are fortunate to have a strong AI-ready state economy. A concerted effort by Gov. Spencer Cox and the Utah Office of Artificial Intelligence Policy set a regulatory framework for the use of AI and led to legislation that encourages AI innovation while ensuring oversight. Expanding the conversation are initiatives like the governor’s “One Utah Summit” and “Energy Superabundance,” along with legislative leadership such as the passage of the Artificial Intelligence Policy Act (UAIPA) in 2024 and public-private partnerships. 
Because of these efforts, Utah is ranked as No. 3 most ready to “win the AI race,” with 13% of businesses already using AI and demand in healthcare, finance, logistics and advanced manufacturing driving this growth. 3 most ready to “win the AI race,” with 13% of businesses already using AI and demand in healthcare, finance, logistics and advanced manufacturing driving this growth., finance, logistics and advanced manufacturing driving this growth.
At the same time, Western Governors University (WGU) and other Utah-based higher education institutions, including Salt Lake Community College, the University of Utah and Utah Valley University, are making swift strides to respond to urgent workforce and education demands for AI. At WGU, our newly launched programs are informed by market research and consultation with technology industry leaders who told us the AI skills most in demand:
In addition, at WGU we are seeing a heightened interest from employers in non-technology power skills like communication, adaptability, collaboration, computational and critical thinking, and leadership. Because of the current drop in entry-level job openings, WGU is also developing more hands-on and experiential learning programs and virtual internships so that our students graduate with the skills needed to get hired one step beyond entry-level.
Employers wanting to “future proof” their businesses would be wise to train in these areas. Progressive companies will see the value of investing in AI training, and future business success will be defined by the ability to positively adapt and the readiness to plan and implement upskilling measures.
At its best, AI allows humans to focus on creative and strategic thinking to deliver complex problem-solving. Workers and employers who continue to invest in career capital will adapt and evolve successfully. We’ve seen at WGU that it’s not so much what AI will do in the workplace. It’s what employers, government, higher learning and workers will do with AI."

84,2025-10-25,"If you've ever tried switching from Photoshop to GIMP, you know the switch isn't as straightforward as it first seems. GIMP has its own interface and tools, and although it offers the same functionality as Photoshop, accessing and using those features is quite different.
There are plugins that make GIMP more powerful than Photoshop, but I found something better. This patch makes GIMP feel like Photoshop, and now it finally feels like a true Photoshop alternative.
I tried to love GIMP, but Photoshop wins me back, one of the main reasons being the interface. The default Photoshop interface is quite easy to get the hang of. All the tools and features are neatly categorized in a manner that you won't even think about which menu you're clicking after following a couple of tutorials.
Yes, you can customize GIMP's interface. In fact, it's one of the areas where GIMP outperforms Photoshop in my opinion. However, if you're a hardcore Photoshop user, the customization isn't quite going to make GIMP a Photoshop replica. You'll still have to abandon years of muscle memory and develop new workflows.
This is where PhotoGIMP comes in. It's a free, open-source customization patch that transforms GIMP's interface to closely mimic Photoshop. It's not a separate application, just a configuration overlay to replace GIMP's default settings.
Apart from reorganizing the entire interface to match Photoshop's layout, the patch also condenses the toolbox into a single-column step, with tools positioned where you'd expect them in Photoshop. It also applies a symbolic icon theme, which is essentially single-color icons similar to what Photoshop uses. This gives GIMP a much cleaner and more modern look.
PhotoGIMP also remaps all of GIMP's default shortcuts to match Photoshop's keybindings. This means that Ctrl + T for transform, Ctrl + D for deselection, and all the other shortcuts you've burned into your brain over years of using Photoshop work right away. No need to erase years of muscle memory and relearn new shortcuts.
Keep in mind that PhotoGIMP doesn't actually modify GIMP's core functionality. All the features, plugin support, and image processing capabilities remain exactly the same. PhotoGIMP only changes how everything is presented and accessed.
The patch also includes a custom splash screen and an optional desktop icon. It's a small touch, but it helps to differentiate your PhotoGIMP setup from the standard GIMP in case you want to use both together.
A patch for optimizing GIMP 3.0+ for Adobe Photoshop users.
Installing PhotoGIMP is quite easy and doesn't require any technical knowledge. The official GitHub repository for the patch has detailed instructions on how to install it for Windows, Linux, and macOS.
All you need to do is extract the ZIP archive for the patch and replace it with GIMP's configuration files in the appropriate directories as per your OS and installation path. On Windows 11, this requires the following steps:
If you want to back up your GIMP configuration before applying the PhotoGIMP patch, make sure to copy the entire GIMP folder copy the entire 3.0 folder from %APPDATA%\GIMP to a safe location. Note that the folder location varies between OSes.
Keep in mind that you need to start and quit GIMP at least once after installing it for the patch to work. Other than that, replacing the stock GIMP configuration files with PhotoGIMP is the only installation step. Going back to the default GIMP interface is as easy as deleting the patch files and folders from the GIMP installation directory.
Since PhotoGIMP is mostly a cosmetic makeover for GIMP, it's not going to magically add features GIMP is missing or make it better than Photoshop than it already may or may not be for you. Photoshop's advanced selection tools, content-aware fill capabilities, AI features, and other workflows still remain exclusive.
What PhotoGIMP does is close the gap between the two programs significantly. Adobe has me locked down, and I hate it. This patch makes the switch easier in the sense that I didn't necessarily lose out on years of muscle memory and workflow efficiency I developed in Photoshop.
GIMP's core features work differently from Photoshop's, even if they're achieving the same results. There's still going to be a learning curve, but PhotoGIMP makes it a little easier for you to get going.
PhotoGIMP is perfect for anyone transitioning from Photoshop to GIMP, wanting to maintain productivity without spending weeks relearning muscle memory. If you're a designer, photographer, or digital artist who knows their way around Photoshop but needs a free alternative, it makes GIMP much more accessible.
However, if you're completely new to image editing and graphic design and haven't used Photoshop before, I'd recommend steering clear of it. The vanilla GIMP interface is still quite functional, and unless you have used Photoshop before, PhotoGIMP doesn't do much.
If you're on the fence about trying GIMP, or tried it before and came back because of the interface, PhotoGIMP is worth a shot. It won't turn GIMP into the perfect Photoshop clone, but it'll get it close enough that you might actually stick with it this time.

85,2025-10-25,"India has developed one of the most comprehensive digital public finance platforms in the world. The Unified Payments Interface (UPI), Account Aggregator (AA), Unified Lending Interface (ULI), and Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) have driven large-scale financial inclusion, says Thomas Krogh Jensen, CEO, Copenhagen Fintech, a hub for fintech representatives across the Nordic region. “This scale is hyper interesting for Nordic fintech companies,” Jensen said in an interview with The Indian Express.
India and Denmark can collaborate in multiple areas, including sustainable finance, cross-border payments and wealth/insurtech and MSME digitisation, he added. Denmark is an ideal launching pad and investor-friendly destination for fintech companies, Jensen stated. Edited Excerpts:
What is your view on the Indian fintech sector?
India has built perhaps the most complete public digital finance stack in the world. Aadhaar is at population scale and processed 221 crore authentications in August 2025 alone; UPI is clearing around 2,000 crore payments a month; and newer rails such as the AA framework and the evolving ULI/OCEN (Open Credit Enablement Network) are pushing consented data-sharing and streamlined credit. The ONDC, meanwhile, has crossed 28.8 crore cumulative orders across retail, mobility and logistics. On top sit globally significant private players such as Razorpay, PhonePe, Groww, Moneyview, Acko and many more — showing the ecosystem’s depth. Of course this scale is hyper interesting for Nordic fintech companies.
India has given UPI and networks like ONDC to the world. What are some such innovations coming out of Denmark?
The Nordics are a prolific fintech lab. Notable Denmark/Nordic-rooted firms include Pleo (a spend management platform born in Copenhagen), Lunar (a Nordic challenger bank), Flatpay (fast-growing merchant payments provider), Tradeshift (focused on B2B networks/supply-chain finance with Danish founders), Chainalysis (focused on blockchain analytics with Danish co-founders), and Synthesia (focused on AI video with Danish founders and a large enterprise footprint). These are different from public rails like UPI/ONDC, but they show the region’s product innovation and scale mindset in financial services.
What are some promising areas of collaboration between India and Denmark, especially in sustainable finance and fintech space?
There are multiple areas where both countries can partner. One, sustainable finance/ climate fintech — Denmark’s strength in green solutions pairs naturally with India’s transition needs. Agreena helps farmers finance the move to regenerative practices through Europe’s largest soil-carbon programme — capabilities that can support India’s agri-transition and MRV (measurement, reporting, verification).
Second is cross-border payments and treasury. Centiglobe enables instant, traceable, two-way cross-border payments via tokenised deposits — now integrated with Mastercard Move. It can be relevant for India-Nordic trade corridors. Banking Circle powers payments for over 650 institutions with nearly 1 trillion euro processed annually, which can be useful infrastructure for Indian fintechs expanding into Europe.
Third, wealth/insurtech & MSME digitisation. Indian scale plus Nordic product craftsmanship makes for strong co-innovation. Particularly where AI, open finance and RegTech (regulatory technology) intersect (e.g., AA-based wealth journeys, SME working capital using OCEN/ULI). Broader industry analysis from WEF/Accenture and NVIDIA also points to AI-powered risk, customer and productivity plays that both markets can co-develop.
What incentives does Denmark provide to Indian fintechs that are looking to set up shop?
A Copenhagen Fintech Lab has been set up, which is a central hub/co-working lab with programmes and community to soft-land and scale. Also, there is a Startup Denmark — a dedicated visa route for non-EU founders with approved business plans. Under the programme, residence/work permit is typically granted for up to two years, with a provision to extend further as well.
We also have a regulatory sandbox through which the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority’s (FSA) FT Lab lets fintechs test innovative models with supervisors in a controlled environment — useful for novel payments, AI or blockchain propositions.
For market entry, we have an ‘Invest in Denmark’ initiative, which is a part of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, based in Bangalore. It offers strategic advice and counselling, free of charge.
How can India and Denmark partner in the climate fintech space?
There are three clear opportunity pools for Denmark/Nordic-India collaboration:
How big do you see climate finance growing in terms of numbers?
The global green finance market was valued at $4.18 trillion (2023) and is projected to reach $28.71 trillion by 2033, indicating a CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) of 21.25 per cent. Green fintech market growth is projected at 22.4 per cent CAGR between 2024 and 2029. These numbers indicate a double-digit, long-cycle growth market where India’s demand and the Nordics’ supply of technology/standards can meet.
How many Indian fintechs operate in Denmark and how many Denmark fintechs have a presence in India?
Several Indian companies have established their presence in Denmark. There are over 35 Indian companies registered and active in Denmark including Infosys, TCS, HCL Tech and LTI Mindtree within the IT space. They support the IT requirements of several large Nordic banks and we hope that this will lay a foundation for closer cooperation between fintech as well from the 2 countries. For Denmark, practical entry paths for Indian fintechs include the Startup Denmark visa, the Danish FSA sandbox, and partnerships with startups and scaleups across the Nordic region. Copenhagen Fintech and The Trade Council of Denmark stand ready to support both in Denmark and in India. Copenhagen and Denmark remain an ideal launch pad for the Nordics ranking high within the ease of doing business and very favourable business framework conditions.

If you go to a Japanese restaurant in the U.S., Nigori may be the first sake that is recommended for you to try.  Indeed, it is a charming, very approachable style of sake. 
Nigori means “cloudy” in Japanese.  Its snowy, opalescent look comes from the light filtration of the mash in sake production.  The remaining sake lees create a delightful, rich mouthfeel with a lingering aftertaste. Also, the residual particles carry pleasant sweetness.   
“Americans like Nigori because it is so unique texturally and requires less of a discerning palate to understand, making it a great starter sake,” says Monica Samuels, president of Kome Collective who has over 20 years of experience in the sake industry. 
Nigori accounts for approximately 20% of Kome Collective’s sales and the number is growing.  “New retailers getting started with sake are viewing Nigori as a great jumping-off point,” she says. 
But Nigori is not just an easy sake to try. It has a long, profound history over the last 17 centuries. 
The origin of Nigori is Doburoku, a sake that goes through no filtration at all, resulting in a dense, porridge-like texture.  Around the ７th century, Doburoku was offered to the gods and over time, people started to develop the filtration techniques.  The lightly filtered sake became Nigori. 
Nigori had been enjoyed among the public for centuries, whereas the clearer sake with a higher level of filtration was served to the upper classes.  Around the 18th century, fully filtered clear sake became more widely available and the popularity of Nigori faded away. 
However, in 1964, Nigori celebrated its revival, thanks to Masuda Tokubee Shoten, the 350-year-old sake brewery in Kyoto and the maker of the Tsukinokatsura brand. 
“My father decided to reintroduce the charm of the cloudy sake to the market and invented a new method of producing Nigori. He coarsely filtered the mash through a basket and kept the liquid unpasteurized to maintain the rigor of fermentation.  Then he let it undergo the second fermentation in a bottle as in the Champagne production,” says Tokubee Masuda, the 14th generation of the brewery. 
This sparkling Nigori paved the way to the resurgence of the cloudy sake and now we see various styles of Nigori in the global market. 
Nigori often carries the image of sweet sake, but there are diverse styles of Nigori, from sweet to dry; still, slightly fizzy and sparkling, as listed below. 
The two key components of Nigori are the level of filtration and whether the production involves pasteurization or not. 
Generally speaking, the more coarsely filtered, the richer and sweeter the taste you get from the sake.  If you like fully filtered lucid sake, but want to discover the charm of Nigori, start from the bottom of the list below, which has fewer residual particles from the fermentation process.  However, Nigori’s pure and bright rice flavor expression can grow on you, because sake is such an ingredient-driven artisanal product.   
You will most likely find the umbrella term Nigori on the label of cloudy sake. 
The sake looks clearer than regular Nigori and the mouthfeel is lightly velvety. 
The cloudiness is even subtler than Usu Nigori. (Note that Sasa Nigori can be synonymous with Usu Nigori, depending on the brand.)
Origarami, or Orizake, is made in the same process as the regular clear sake, but the last step of the production is intentionally skipped: clarification of the liquid after being fully filtered.  This type of Nigori lets you enjoy both the clearness of non-Nigori sake and the boost of umami from the floating particles of sake lees. 
Pasteurization terminates the fermentation completely to make the sake still.  This type of Nigori has a rounded, smooth palate experience. 
Since the mash was coarsely filtered and unpasteurized, the fermentation continues in the bottle, making the sake naturally fizzy. Many Nigori fans love this liveliness. 
The aforementioned sparkling Nigori that Masuda Tokubee Shoten introduced to the market in the 1960s belongs to this type.  The Champagne-style sparkling Nigori is festive and elegant with a delicate mouthfeel. 
 
Chilled Nigori showcases the balance between the sweetness and acidity.  You can try Nigori in two ways.
One is to shake the bottle or stir the liquid in the glass to evenly distribute the lees.
The other way is to pour Nigori in the glass and wait for the sediments to settle at the bottom.  As you slowly sip it from the clear layer of Nigori on top to the bottom, you can enjoy the gradation of the flavor and mouthfeel. 
You can also add other ingredients to Nigori to make a great cocktail, such as Aperol and Matcha. Fruit juice and milk also go very well with Nigori. 
Still (pasteurized) Nigori is delicious at a warm temperature, too.  The warmed sake is called Kanzake. Typically, somewhere around 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius) to 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius) works best for Nigori to embrace an elevated fragrance and smoother mouthfeel. 
The 14th generation Masuda of Masuda Tokubee Shoten has experimented with various ways to taste Nigori.  “One of my favorites is on the rocks, scented with yuzu or lemon peel.  I also like pouring Nigori over frozen espresso coffee, which is surprisingly so enjoyable.” 
As for food pairings, he loves pairing Nigori with Tonkatsu, a Japanese-style pork cutlet.  “Nigori works very well with fried food,” he says.   
Kome Collective’s Samuels says, “American flavors tend to be bolder and richer, and Nigori stands up well to those flavors, like barbecue. I really enjoy Nigori with complex spices, like jerk chicken and Indian spice.  Also, lacto-fermented foods, such as kimchi, pickles, yogurt and fermented grains like sourdough bread, are popular right now.  The tanginess in these foods goes very well with the tart and bright qualities of many Nigori sakes.”
Sweeter nigori can work perfectly with various desserts like chocolate cake and Crème brûlée, just as a dessert wine. 
 
Dassai, the leading sake producer that is responsible for approximately 15% of the total sake export from Japan, opened its U.S. brewery in New York in 2023.  Since then, the company has been exploring innovative strategies to offer the highest quality sake in the global market.  The most recent decision it has made is to produce its Nigori sake solely in the U.S.  for the global market, including Japan.  
The decision to shift the Nigori production entirely to the U.S. makes sense, because 90% of Dassai’s Nigori brewed in Japan has been destined for the U.S. export. 
“The key to excellent Nigori is its freshness. The residual particles in Nigori tend to lose their flavor faster than clear sake.  By eliminating the lengthy transportation from Japan, we can maintain Nigori’s superb quality,” says Kazuhiro Sakurai, the president of Dassai. 
The company waited for the new U.S. brewery to stabilize its operations.  “Now, two years after its opening, we are confident of our production capacity to make the highest quality Nigori, just as good as in Japan,” he says. 
Dassai has been producing Sparkling Nigori in the U.S. already and it is a success.  Sakurai feels the growing potential of Nigori.     
“People have been enjoying Nigori for its distinctive color and sweetness.  But there are more refined styles of Nigori, like our Daiginjo Sparkling Nigori, available in the market.  Considering its food-friendly qualities far beyond Japanese dishes, Nigori can be widely enjoyed among beginners and sake connoisseurs alike all over the world.” "

92,2025-10-25,"SpaceX, the space exploration company led by Elon Musk, has reportedly transferred over $133 million in Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), causing a stir in the cryptocurrency market.
The blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence disclosed that SpaceX moved a total of 1,215 Bitcoin to various addresses. This transfer occurred merely days after the company relocated a similar quantity to addresses under its control.
On Friday, the firm announced via X, “SpaceX just moved funds totalling $133.7 million. They transferred 300 BTC ($33M) and 915 BTC ($100.7M) to new wallets.” 
Notably, unlike SpaceX’s previous transfers, the new wallets are not currently identified as belonging to the Hawthorne, California-based company.

Before these transfers, SpaceX held 8,285 BTC, valued at roughly $914 million, ranking it fourth on the list of privately held companies with Bitcoin treasuries, as per data from BitcoinTreasuries.net.
Meanwhile, Tesla Inc.  also holds a substantial Bitcoin portfolio, with 11,509 BTC, valued at over $1.27 billion.
SpaceX’s massive Bitcoin transfer is significant as it could potentially impact the Bitcoin market. The company’s previous Bitcoin holdings placed it among the top private companies with Bitcoin treasuries. 
Any changes in such a large portfolio could cause market fluctuations. Furthermore, the transfer raises questions about SpaceX’s future plans for its Bitcoin holdings. The company’s silence on the matter has led to speculation about potential sales or investments. 
This move also highlights the growing trend of major corporations investing in Bitcoin, with Tesla Inc. also maintaining a substantial Bitcoin portfolio.

Bitcoin has swung wildly this month as Elon Musk suddenly sets alarm bells ringing and warnings of an an “imminent dollar and financial crisis"" spook traders.

The bitcoin price has surged back from a “flash crash” that sent it toward $100,000 per bitcoin, up almost 10% and topping $111,000 as Binance’s founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao issues a huge, $28 trillion bitcoin prediction.
Now, as U.S. president Donald Trump weighs a $2,000 Covid stimulus check-style tariff dividend, Wall Street giants are bracing for the Federal Reserve to end the reduction of its $6.6 trillion balance sheet, known as quantitative tightening—and predicted to unleash a fresh round of central bank money printing and send bitcoin to a $1 million price.

“Starting in next year, we’re going to see an acceleration of money printing at least out of the out of the United States,” Arthur Hayes, the cofounder of crypto derivatives pioneer BitMex who went onto launch the Maelstrom investment company, said in a wide-ranging interview with crypto news outlet Milk Road, pointing to a speech earlier this month by Fed chair Jerome Powell.
“[Quantitative tightening] is over. They’re going to be releasing trillions of dollars into the mortgage markets. Rates are coming down and so the environment is ripe for appreciation of assets.”
The Fed’s quantitative tightening program, which began in 2022, has reduced the Fed’s balance sheet to $6.6 trillion, from around $9 trillion at its peak, putting pressure on risk assets such as bitcoin as the Fed tries to suck liquidity from the system.
“Our long-stated plan is to stop balance sheet runoff when reserves are somewhat above the level we judge consistent with ample reserve conditions,” Powell said in a speech, while also opening the door to further interest rate cuts.
This week, analysts with JPMorgan and Bank of America predicted the Fed will this month stop shrinking its $6.6 trillion balance sheet, in notes seen by Bloomberg, ending a process designed to remove liquidity from financial markets.
""Money markets at current or higher levels should signal to the Fed that reserves are no longer ‘abundant,,"" Bank of America’s Mark Cabana and Katie Craig wrote.
Meanwhile, the Fed is widely expected to cut interest rates again, shaving off another 25 basis points next week after resuming its rate cutting cycle in September—something that is also expected to fuel risk assets such as bitcoin as cash more easily flows around the system.
The delayed consumer price index (CPI) report for September on Friday showed U.S. inflation rose less than expected to 3% last month, below the expectations of 3.1% among economists polled by Bloomberg.

“Given the latest news on layoffs, some analysts may be wondering if the central bank should go for a bigger cut, if not this month, then maybe in December,” David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, said in emailed comments.
“The Federal Reserve has made it clear that it is far more worried about the labour market than it is about inflation.”
The bitcoin price has matched gold’s rally over the last 12 months, with the pair surging as part of the so-called ""debasement trade” that’s seen traders turn to hard assets like gold, silver and bitcoin as hedges against money printing and inflation that reduces the dollar’s purchasing power.
“[Gold and silver are] really being purely valued on fiat debasement, whereas bitcoin and crypto still have this connection to to U.S. big tech, which I think they’ll shed at some point,” Hayes told Milk Road. ""But in any event, we know which way the world is going. It’s more fiat debasement. Those who have the foresight, who are looking what’s going on, they are voting with their money and they’re saying, ‘I want gold. I want bitcoin. I want silver. I want stocks.’ I just think that crypto is the fastest horse.”"

Some moments are so ridiculous that all you can do is stare and wonder how people like this make it through a day.
What would you do if a stranger stormed up to your friend, started shouting questions about noodles, and clearly assumed he worked there just because of his race?
Would you call them out? Or would you let your friend handle it himself?
In the following story, a fast-food worker finds himself in this exact situation and chooses the latter.
Here’s what happened.
Michael and I worked together at our small town’s McDonald’s when I was 16 and he was 20.
One day, Michael offered to cook me dinner at my house, but first, he needed to run to the Asian food store in a neighboring larger town to pick up some ingredients (keep in mind, Michael is Korean).
So we get to the store, and we are both wearing our McDonald’s uniforms, which consist of a fire-truck red button-down with the yellow M on it, black slacks, ugly non-slick shoes, and uglier visors.
I’m following him around while he grabs what he needs, when suddenly a stranger appears.
This random, crusty, sun-burnt fish stick looking mother ****** storms up to Michael (who is Korean) and waves his package of noodles in his face and shouts, “Do you have these in a bigger size?!”
Here’s where things took an ever weirder turn.
Michael and I look at each other, unsure of what’s going on, because there is no way he thinks either one of us works there, because we are both very obviously dressed like McDonald’s employees.
After no response from us, he leans in closer to Michael and screams, “YOU CARRY NOODLES IN BIG BIG SIZE BAG? WHERE FIND?” (think Dwight Schrute talking to the Chinese guy with Holly when Michael gets abandoned by Jim/dines and dashes)
At this point, I am shocked, and Michael is just staring at this guy in silence.
Finally, after several uncomfortable seconds, Michael ever so kindly says, “Um, I don’t ******* work here, you racist.”
And the guy just rolls his eyes and walks away, like it’s the 6th time he’s talked to an Asian person who didn’t work there. It was a weird day.
Yikes! You can’t say the guy didn’t deserve that.
Let’s check out what the people over at Reddit think about this interaction.
This reader likes the story.

Here’s a way to get him back.

For this person, it’s all about racism.

Yet another person who talks about racism.

That guy needs to get a grip. Next time, he should take time and find an actual employee.
