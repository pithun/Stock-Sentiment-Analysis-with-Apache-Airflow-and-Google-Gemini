Until recently, a $100 billion net worth granted entry to the world's most exclusive club. Soaring fortunes in the AI era have made $200 billion the new number to beat.
Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and Alphabet cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are each worth over $200 billion, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows.
They're individually worth more than some of America's biggest companies: PepsiCo, Uber, Walt Disney, and Intel were valued around $200 billion each at Thursday's market close.
Luxury tycoon Bernard Arnault, the LVMH CEO, is close to rejoining the elite club, as his fortune has swelled by around $18 billion this year to $194 billion. Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang could be knocking on the door soon, as their fortunes stand at $181 billion and $176 billion, respectively, as of Thursday's close.
The six existing members of the $200 billion club are collectively worth around $1.7 trillion, led by two men in leagues of their own: Musk on $457 billion and Ellison on $317 billion.
For a sense of scale, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, one of the world's biggest companies with around 400,000 employees, generated $371 billion of revenue last year and has a $1 trillion market value.
The half-dozen individuals have grown $330 billion richer as a group this year, with Ellison up $124 billion, Page up $76 billion, and Brin up $70 billion as of Thursday. At the start of this year, only Musk, Bezos, and Zuckerberg were worth more than $200 billion, the rich list shows.
The ultra-exclusive club has doubled in membership within 10 months because of the immense buzz around AI, which has boosted the stock prices of Big Tech companies and the fortunes of their largest shareholders.
Oracle has surged 54% year to date, lifting the value of Ellison's roughly 40% stake in the enterprise-software giant. Alphabet has jumped 49%, meaning Brin and Page's stakes of around 6% each are worth more than ever. The upshot is that all three have crossed the $200 billion mark, with Ellison blowing past that point.
Huang and Ballmer also own pieces of AI-leading firms. Nvidia, which briefly became the first $5 trillion company on Wednesday, has seen a 51% stock surge this year. Shares of Microsoft, which recently crossed $4 trillion in market value before retreating, are up 25%.
Those stock surges have added $62 billion and $34 billion to Huang and Ballmer's respective fortunes this year, propelling them closer to $200 billion each.
There's no guarantee that the AI stock boom will keep pushing the ultrawealthy's fortunes higher, but if it does, the $200 billion club could get a lot more crowded.

Manage your relationships like you manage your stock portfolio.
That's the advice that Andrew ""Boz"" Bosworth, the CTO of Meta, gave in a blog post this week about what he described as managing your ""emotional economy.""
""Imagine each person in your life as a publicly traded security,"" Bosworth, who has been at Meta since 2006, wrote. ""You're heavily invested in a few — your parents, your partner, your manager. You hold small positions in many others, like coworkers or acquaintances. And then there are people you have no stake in at all — strangers on the street, commenters online, passing critics.""
Bosworth said how much influence someone has over our sense of self-worth should be proportionate to how much we've emotionally invested in them.
""When a guy on the street insults your shirt, it shouldn't register any more than a stock you don't own crashing,"" he said. ""But most of us don't run our emotional portfolios so rationally.""
Bosworth said most of us grant others ""emotional equity"" in our lives that they haven't earned. Instead, he said, we should be putting emotional investments into relationships that actually deliver returns.
He wrote: ""Manage your emotional economy like any other portfolio: diversify wisely, invest intentionally, and don't panic when the market dips.""
Bosworth, who regularly shares advice on his personal blog, said his goal is to share what he's learned over his career, and that most of the lessons he learned ""the hard way.""
Bosworth did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Meta reported Q3 earnings on Wednesday, with its stock declining 9% in after-hours trading following the call.

Mark Zuckerberg's net worth just took a tumble.
The Meta CEO dropped two spots on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index after the company's quarterly earnings report sent its stock sliding. Zuckerberg lost around $29.2 billion overnight, leaving him with $235 billion.
The drop pushed him to fifth place on the index, below Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Alphabet's Larry Page.
Page's net worth increased to $244 billion as Alphabet's shares rose 2.5% after the company beat earnings estimates, buoyed by robust growth in Google Cloud and Search.
Bezos' fortune fell by about $6.6 billion. Meanwhile, Amazon's stock jumped more than 13% on Thursday after the company reported huge growth in the third quarter, including in its cloud business, Amazon Web Services.
Zuckerberg's fortune has taken hits in the past when earnings spooked its investors. Meta shares plunged about 24% in 2022 after the company missed earnings targets and Zuckerberg pledged to pour billions more into building the metaverse. The metaverse bet wiped out about $100 billion from his wealth at that time.
Investors have been jittery about Meta's big AI spending plans. Meta said on Wednesday it could spend $70 billion to $72 billion on AI capital expenditures in 2025, up from its previous guidance of $66 billion to $72 billion. Meta CFO Susan Li said spending will climb even higher in 2026 as Meta invests in data centers, cloud services, and salaries for the growing ranks of AI researchers and engineers hired for Meta Superintelligence Labs.
Mark Zuckerberg faced a flurry of questions in a call with analysts on Wednesday about how Meta is spending the billions it's pouring into AI.
When JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth asked about Meta's soaring costs, Zuckerberg said pouring money into AI was the smart play, even if the company ends up overshooting.
​​In what he called the ""very worst case,"" Meta would have ""pre-built for a couple of years,"" taking on some depreciation costs before eventually growing into the extra capacity, Zuckerberg said.
That was better than being caught short on compute when the next wave of AI breakthroughs arrives, he added.
After the earnings report was released, Meta's stock plummeted nearly 9%.
As of Thursday evening, Meta's stock had fallen more than 11%.
Zuckerberg did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.
Microsoft's stock prices also dropped on Wednesday following its earnings announcement. The software giant reported a record $34.9 billion in capital expenditures last quarter, up from the $24.2 billion the quarter before. The company also said spending could increase in 2026.
Shares of Microsoft fell 3% at intraday lows on Thursday.
Peter Berezin, chief market strategist at BCA Research, said the stock declines in Meta and Microsoft were a ""yellow flag"" for the AI trade. In a recent note to clients, he said a possible warning for the AI trade could be when a major tech firm announces plans to spend more on capex, only to see their stock prices fall.
Berezin told Business Insider on Thursday that he expected to see that play out across the sector in the future, which would mark a clearer warning that the AI hype is starting to deflate.
""When Zuck comes out and says, we're making all these investments based on the best-case scenario for AI because we don't want to be left behind — that's dangerous, right? Because if you don't get that best-case scenario, you are going to have pretty significant write-offs,"" Berezin said.

Amazon just posted its third-quarter earnings and it turns out it was a phenomenal quarter for the e-commerce giant, despite recent layoffs.
The company giant raked in $180.2 billion in sales in the three months ending Sept. 30, up 13% from the same period last year. Its cloud business, AWS, reported its largest year-over-year growth since 2022, climbing 20% to $33 billion. The company’s stock even popped 13% in after-hours trading following the report.
So why, with the company performing so well, did Amazon just slash 14,000 corporate jobs and hinted that more cuts could be on the way?
Fortunately for us, CEO Andy Jassy was asked to comment on the layoffs during the company’s earnings call Thursday evening. However, he was quick to downplay any connection to AI.
âWhat I would tell you is, you know, the announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it’s not even really AI driven, not right now at least,â Jassy told investors. âIt’s culture.â
He went on to try to make the case that the companyâs rapid growth over the last several years added more people, layers, and complexity to its operations. This quick growth, in turn, slowed decision-making and weakened ownership for workers at the frontlines.
Jassy said Amazon is now committed to operating like the world’s largest startup in order to move more quickly during what he called the major “technology transformation happening right now.â
The memo sent to laid-off employees earlier this week hit a lot of the same points Jassy made. But it also directly named the big tech shift, AI, that he had been hinting at, even as he claimed it wasnât driving this round of layoffs.
“This generation of AI is the most transformative technology weâve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). Weâre convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business,â wrote Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, in the memo.
Still, these job cuts also come as Amazon, and the rest of Silicon Valley, is seemingly betting it all on AI.
Jassy said on Thursday that the companyâs AI and cloud infrastructure added more than 3.8 gigawatts of power capacity in the past 12 months and is expected to add another gigawatt this fourth quarter.
And future cuts may not be limited to corporate workers. The New York Times reported last week that Amazonâs automation team expects that by 2027, the company could avoid hiring more than 160,000 U.S. workers it would normally need. Overall, Amazonâs robotics team has an ultimate goal to automate 75 percent of the companyâs operations, according to internal documents obtained by The New York Times.

Mobileye is a sponsor of ""Inside Self-Driving: The AI-Driven Evolution of Autonomous Vehicles."" This article was specially created for Mobileye.
The autonomous vehicle market is experiencing rapid growth, driven by technological advancements and infrastructure investments. But scaling up depends on making the vehicles safe and ready for drivers and riders.
During the virtual event, ""Inside Self-Driving: The AI-Driven Evolution of Autonomous Vehicles,"" presented by Mobileye, a panel of experts from across the autonomous industry, discussed how the technology is transforming and how automakers, tech innovators, and policymakers are collaborating to make the vehicles safe and scalable.
Across two sessions, they examined the state of AV technology and infrastructure, as well as customer perception and adoption.
Scaling AV technology depends on proving to users and regulators that the vehicles are safe, said AI expert Dr. Deborah Berebichez, kicking off the first session covering Mobileye's collaboration with Lyft.
For consumers, AVs have been something of a novelty, said Stephen Hayes, vice president of autonomous, fleets, and driver operations at Lyft. To change that, he said, companies like his need to educate users about the technology, emphasize its safety, and ensure that riders' experiences with AVs are ""delightful,"" so that they opt in for future autonomous trips.
Demonstrating that AV crash rates are lower than human drivers' is a key data point for regulators, said JJ Jungwirth, executive vice president of autonomous vehicles at Mobileye. It's also important to show that the technology ""never sleeps"" — it's surrounded by sensors and cameras that ""react in milliseconds,"" much faster than humans, he said.
Also, regulators should understand that special lanes or other infrastructure aren't necessary for roadways to accommodate AVs, Jungwirth said.
Partnerships are also crucial, Hayes emphasized. ""The market opportunity here is enormous. More players are realizing that we can go further by finding partners that have very complementary skill sets.""
AVs are ready to accommodate drivers and passengers, and are in the phase where ""full autonomy has gone from the science project into an actual product,"" said James Philbin, head of autonomy at Rivian, during the second session, which focused on how cities, automakers, and regulators are making the technology work for everyday people.
There are significant AV deployments in certain cities, such as San Francisco, and Philbin said he expects that to scale up quickly. He believes the next phase will involve incorporating more personally owned self-driving vehicles.
One challenge is integrating AVs into existing transportation networks as the technology expands, said Charlie Tyson, technology activation director of Michigan's Office of Future Mobility and Electrification. This is something Michigan is currently working on, he said.
The goal is to get drivers more comfortable with AVs and normalize using them, Philbin says. He expects AV taxis to become ubiquitous in the coming years and personal vehicles to have more autonomous features.
Tyson adds that the public needs more opportunities to ""experience the technology."" He said pilot projects in Michigan revealed that nearly all AV riders would take another trip in an AV and recommend it to their peers. However, they felt less comfortable without a human safety driver.
""I don't think the trust issue is going to be a persistent one,"" Philbin said. ""As people get more used to those high levels of autonomy, they'll expect more autonomy in their vehicles.""
AV makers are working to advance the technology, such as ensuring the vehicles adapt to harsh weather conditions and high-population densities, and collecting data on how people drive in these situations, Philbin said.
Ultimately, Tyson said the industry is focused on debunking the biggest myth about AVs: that the technology isn't ready for everyday consumers or that it's unsafe.
""I think it's just the opposite,"" he says. ""Let's get these vehicles out there, and let's allow people to experience them.""

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with 28-year-old Jen Baik, a former Google employee who left the company to focus on AI safety. The following has been edited for length and clarity.
My first two years at Google, working as a product operations manager for Google Meet, were magical in a way I could have never imagined. The job was challenging, and I got to collaborate with some of the best people I've ever encountered.
It was perfect on paper, but something was missing. As time went on, being on the outskirts of the suffering I knew was happening in the world while growing money felt jarring. It was like being in Disneyland every day: the massage rooms, unlimited food, and other perks. But at some point, you get sick of Disneyland.
I've always been keen on mission-driven work. Growing up, I wanted to be a therapist, a teacher, or work at a nonprofit. After college, my goal was to pay off my student loans and build a safety net for my parents. I started my career in consulting at Accenture, working on tech strategy, which was challenging and interesting.
After being in the workforce for a bit, effective altruism came into the picture because of how comfortable I knew my life was, despite the fact that so many others lacked resources. I wished I could take less of what I had and give it to someone who needed it more, and I was searching for an analytically driven understanding of how to work to alleviate suffering.
At Google, I served as co-lead of a grassroots effective altruism club, where we coordinated discussions, wrote a newsletter, and encouraged people to make use of the $400 that the company gives employees to make a holiday donation.
Leaving was one of the most difficult decisions I've ever had to make. But after paying off my loans and saving up for my parents, I gave myself permission to take a chance on myself — even as it meant walking away from a six-figure job and unvested equity that could've amounted to the purchase of a house one day.
I originally got into effective altruism through a global health and development lens, but AI safety sprang up on me last year after reading Scott Alexander's ""AI 2027,"" which posits a scenario where artificial superintelligence could disempower humanity. I also like Tristan Harris' arguments about how AI could cause worse harms than social media.
I think AI is going to change everything, and I want to be a part of working toward pathways that can lead to human flourishing and autonomy.
Without the rise of AI, I probably would've stayed at Google. I tried switching to AI-related roles internally, but it's competitive to transfer, and I ultimately felt like I could effect a greater change outside.
For my next chapter, I'm moving from New York to San Francisco to live in an intentional community. I want to focus on inner work and effective altruism — learning and being in the trenches. I'd like to offer support to Charity Entrepreneurship, which incubates evidence-backed charities, and plan to apply to the BlueDot Impact AI safety program.
I've lived in intentional communities before, and even started my own. That's the vision I have for my life. It's like a found family: the serendipitous conversations that can arise, cooking for one another, the community that compounds around aligned values.
Spending-wise, I don't expect my lifestyle to change all that much without income. I have enough runway for a year, and another lever of longer-term savings after that. Plus, I tend to be pretty frugal, and wealth accumulation has never been a goal.
Before leaving a couple of weeks ago, my parents begged me to stay at Google, and friends warned me about the job market. Some were jealous, and some thought I was crazy. But even though it was really hard, I knew I didn't want my life to follow the default path.

7,2025-10-31,"Following yesterday’s quarterly report, Apple saw a welcome bump in its stock price. But as markets opened and the day progressed, investor sentiment appeared to shift slightly. Here are the details.
During the last few days, most tech companies had rather momentous earnings reports. Meta’s stock dropped 12%, Amazon saw a 9.5% jump, and PayPal erased the 11% it gained after announcing a partnership with OpenAI just hours before.
Apple, on the other hand, saw a more muted reaction, with shares up today about 2% in pre-market trading, following yesterday’s announcement. But that slight optimism was short-lived, as the stock dropped 2.5% in the first minutes of trading, slipping below yesterday’s close.
The rest of the session saw modest swings, with the stock crossing above and below the flat line several times before closing down 0.38% at the bell.
Given the sharp swings seen across other tech stocks during the week, and investor sentiment going into the results with uncertainty around iPhone demand, Apple’s AI challenges, and the regulatory pressure surrounding the company’s operations, it is possible that many investors saw today’s uneventful session as a relief, despite the 0.38% drop.
Still, as we head into what Apple is already projecting as its biggest quarter ever, it will be interesting to see whether that optimism carries over to Wall Street.
How do you think Apple’s stock will do this quarter? Let us know in the comments.

8,2025-10-31,"Newly stripped of his ""prince"" title, Andrew is moving from his Windsor mansion, Royal Lodge, to the Sandringham estate in Norfolk, it is understood.
Formal notice was given to surrender the lease at the Royal Lodge on Thursday, and the move will take place as soon as possible.
The historic, sprawling estate spans approximately 31 sq miles (80 sq km) of gardens - making it around the same size as Nottingham or Brighton and Hove.
It was bought as a private country retreat for the future Edward VII when he was Albert, Prince of Wales in 1862, and has since been passed down from monarch to monarch.
The estate itself covers several residential villages and hamlets, and includes 15 sq miles (40 sq km) of farmland.
The main building - Sandringham House - is thought to have more than a hundred rooms, including a ballroom.
It remains a country retreat for the Royal Family and is where they traditionally gather at Christmas.
Andrew will be moving some 140 miles (225km) north-east of his Windsor mansion - and away from senior royals like King Charles III and Queen Camilla, who reside in London, and the Prince and Princess of Wales in Windsor.
Some assumed Andrew would move from Royal Lodge to another property on the Windsor estate, Frogmore Cottage for example, royal biographer Robert Hardman told the BBC.
""But no,"" he said, ""he's off the estate, he's out of Windsor, he's out of royal Berkshire - he's been sent up the M11 to the royal equivalent of Siberia to sit in Sandringham for the rest of his life.""
""This is - some might say brutal, others might say definitive.""
Sandringham is a private estate - not an official royal residence - and it is understood the King will be privately funding Andrew's accommodation there, and that it will not be directly funded by the taxpayer.
The Palace has not yet said exactly where on the estate Andrew will live, or when he could move.
But royal sources have said it will not be immediate, and instead be ""as soon as possible and practicable"". 
Here is a look at some of the options on the estate.
Originally known as Bachelor's Cottage, York Cottage is about a quarter of a mile from the main house.
It has its own set of stables and kennel buildings, according to Historic England, and overlooks one of two man-made lakes on the estate.
There were reports ahead of Prince Harry's marriage to the Duchess of Sussex that the pair might have been gifted the use of York Cottage by Elizabeth II for use as a country home, but no such plan was ever confirmed and the move never materialised.
It has reportedly been used as an office and accommodation for staff in recent years.
The birthplace of Diana, Princess of Wales and her childhood home, Park House was rented by the Spencer family for many years.
In 1983 it was gifted to Leonard Cheshire, a disability charity, which used it to run a 16-bedroom hotel for the disabled, their carers and family.
The charity planned a £2.3m refurbishment before the pandemic hit, but announced in 2020 it would not go ahead with the proposal and said instead that it was working with the Sandringham estate to exit the lease.
Another option is the Gardens House, which was once the residence of the head gardener on the Sandringham estate.
The Edwardian house has six bedrooms and three bathrooms, is dog-friendly and is one of two properties on the estate available to the general public as a holiday let.
Its grounds hold a working sawmill and organic farm.
It was put on the market in July at a weekly price of £4,110. It is not unusual for royal residences to rent out property to holidaymakers - with eight cottages and lodges available for hire at Balmoral Castle in Scotland.

Another possibility is The Folly - a three-bedroom, two-bathroom lodge built in the 1800s.
Complete with a turret and a wraparound balcony, it has been used as a hunting lodge and a place to take afternoon tea.
Also listed as a holiday let to the public, it is said to have room for six guests - a change from the 30-room Windsor mansion Andrew will be vacating.
Given the lodge's ""grandeur"", Majesty Magazine's managing editor Joe Little told the BBC earlier this year, there is a ""a heightened awareness that the privately owned royal estates are actively striving to bolster"" the Royal Family's revenue streams.
This is one option that is understood to have been ruled out.
The farmhouse, described as ""small and intimate"" by former housekeeper Teresa Thompson, has strong associations with Andrew's parents.
His father, the late Duke of Edinburgh, chose the secluded property as his permanent home when he retired from public life in 2017.
He and the late Queen already regularly stayed there in preference to opening up Sandringham House when it was just the two of them.
Anmer Hall was gifted to the Prince of Wales and Catherine, Princess of Wales as a wedding present by the late queen in 2013 - so this may be an unlikely choice.
They spend much of the school holidays in the 10-bedroom, Grade II*-listed house, which is about 2 miles (3km) east of the main Sandringham house.
The Georgian property dates back to about 1802, but some parts are much older - and it has formed part of the Sandringham estate since 1898.
Some people in Carrickfergus suggest exchanging Prince Andrew Way for the name of another royal.
The language of Buckingham Palace's statement is ""very brutal"", royal historian Kelly Swaby tells the BBC.
Stripping Andrew of the title 'prince' is colossal, says the BBC's royal correspondent Sean Coughlan.
The relatives of the late Virginia Giuffre, who accused the royal of sexual abuse, say she would be ""proud"".
The dramatic move follows weeks of intense scrutiny over his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

The US stock market is flying high right now, but some experts are ringing alarm bells. NVIDIA and other AI giants continue to smash records, while nervous analysts warn that all the hype could come crashing down. If you’re trying to stay one step ahead of the next swing in sentiment, Google’s latest tool might come in handy.
The company has added a new earnings experience to the Google Finance beta, bringing live audio streams, instant transcripts, and AI-powered summaries that explain the key takeaways from company results. It’s the latest addition to the redesigned Finance page that Google began testing in August.
Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority?
Google product lead Rose Yao announced the rollout on X, saying, “earnings season just got a major upgrade.” You can browse an upcoming earnings calendar or pick a stock from your watchlist to jump into the new Earnings tab. Whether you follow the live audio there or read the summary after, there are AI insights that update in real-time with market data and analyst reactions.
You’ll also see a quick breakdown of quarterly results, comparisons with previous earnings, and how each company performed against revenue and EPS estimates. It’s a shortcut to understanding the implications behind these financially dense events, and it’s available now to everyone using the Google Finance beta in English in the US.
After adding AI Q&A and advanced charting earlier this year, this feels like another step in Google’s attempt to make Finance a genuine market-tracking hub. Given the current state of the economy, it’s not a bad time to start paying attention.

Michael Burry is back with a bang.
The investor of ""The Big Short"" fame posted on X for the first time since April 2023 on Thursday. He shared a still from the movie of actor Christian Bale, who portrayed Burry, staring at a computer screen in disbelief.
""Sometimes, we see bubbles,"" he wrote. ""Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play.""
That's a reference to the 1983 movie ""WarGames,"" in which an AI runs thousands of simulations of nuclear exchanges between the US and Soviet Union and discovers they all end in mutual destruction.  ""A strange game,"" the supercomputer says. ""The only winning move is not to play.""
Burry's pinned post suggests he sees unsustainable levels of speculation in markets that he expects to end in devastation, and he's decided that steering clear of the AI boom, instead of betting on or against it, is the only winning strategy.
Immense buzz over AI has boosted Big Tech stocks such as Nvidia; its shares have surged over 1,200% since the start of 2023, propelling it to an unprecedented $5 trillion market value this week, and helping to catapult the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes to record highs in recent days.
Burry updated his profile name to ""Cassandra Unchained,"" referring to the priestess in Greek mythology who was cursed to make accurate prophecies but never to be believed. He also changed his bio to read: ""One ready to share what I know.""
Echoing his return to the social media platform in November 2021, Burry once again changed his header image to ""Satire of Tulip Mania,"" a painting by Jan Brueghel the Younger that ridicules the Dutch tulip bubble in the 1600s.
Sometimes, we see bubbles.Sometimes, there is something to do about it.Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play. pic.twitter.com/xNBSvjGgvs
Burry is best known for predicting and profiting from the collapse of the housing bubble in the mid-2000s. His contrarian wager was immortalized in the book and film ""The Big Short.""
He's also famous in financial circles for frequently predicting market crashes and recessions, investing in GameStop long before it became a meme stock, and betting against Elon Musk's Tesla, Cathie Wood's flagship Ark fund, Apple, microchip stocks including Nvidia, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 in recent years.
Notably, in the summer of 2021, he sounded the alarm on the ""greatest speculative bubble of all time in all things"" and cautioned buyers of meme stocks and cryptocurrencies that they were careening toward the ""mother of all crashes.""
Burry's dire warnings caught Musk's attention in late 2021, when the world's richest man labeled him a ""broken clock."" The Scion Asset Management chief also sent shockwaves through Wall Street in early 2023 with a single-word post: ""Sell.""
However, Burry ceased posting to his primary account's 1.4 million followers shortly afterward.
Burry appeared to grow more optimistic in the second quarter of this year, when his hedge fund swapped bearish put options on six stocks for bullish call options on nine stocks, per its latest portfolio update. The notional values of those positions were $186 million and $522 million, respectively.
At the end of March, Scion held seven positions, including puts on Alibaba, JD.com, and Nvidia, as well as a direct stake in Estée Lauder. Three months later, it held 15 positions, including calls and direct stakes in Estée Lauder and Lululemon, and calls on Alibaba, JD.com, and VF.
""He has gone from a strong conviction bet on a sector fall to a broad-based bet the bull run will continue,"" Peter Mallouk, the president and CEO of Creative Planning, told Business Insider in August.
Scion didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

I told you in July that there have never been companies like these. I was talking about tech giants, including Apple, Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia. Most of the Magnificent 7.
After this week, I'm narrowing the group to three. Bernard Golden, a cloud industry veteran who literally wrote the book on the technology, calls this group ""AMG."" That's Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
These are the largest cloud providers by far. This business has reached a scale that the world has never seen before. It creates a powerful financial loop that builds momentum almost every quarter.
This is what makes ""AMG,"" or Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, more special than other tech giants.
Take Meta, for example. While it's also spending billions of dollars on data centers and technical gear, it doesn't have a cloud service, and therefore lacks a clear way to get a quick return on this heavy investment. This is part of the reason Meta shares slumped this week. CEO Mark Zuckerberg doesn't have a clear enough answer (yet?) for how all this infrastructure investment will pay off for Meta shareholders.
In contrast, AMG has an answer to these questions. On Thursday, Amazon reported $33 billion in cloud revenue and $11 billion of cloud profit. In just one quarter. That's a 35% profit margin, which is very healthy for a gargantuan operation in a competitive business.
The charts below show how unprecedented this AMG phenomenon is, courtesy of analysts at Barclays.
First up is capital expenditures. Everyone has done this chart this week, so it shouldn't be that surprising. It's still kinda shocking in terms of sheer dollars. AMG accounts for most of this:
Next up is AMG cloud revenue. The ramp here is stunning. Amazon Web Services is still the cloud boss.
Third chart: Growth rates. It's extremely rare for businesses of this size to continue growing at rates of 20% or more. While AWS lagged recently, it topped the 20% bar again in the third quarter, stoking a huge stock rally on Friday.
The final chart is my favorite. This shows the dollar growth rate of these AMG cloud businesses, or how much each company has added in dollar revenue over the preceding 12 months. It's a common metric on Wall Street known as TTM, or trailing 12 months.
This chart reveals which cloud giants have been growing the fastest in raw dollar terms (rather than % terms, which can sometimes make smaller cloud providers appear more successful).
The latest data shows that Microsoft Azure is growing the most, based on this dollar metric. And you can also see how AWS's growth rate has slowed, relatively speaking, since the pandemic boom:

1. There are a lot of empty seats; a lot.
2. The demo wasn't live, likely due to the huge failure of an event that the Meta one was.
3. They noted that you do all of this 'hands-free', likely an intentional knock at Meta's offering.
4. The examples were...odd. Who the fuck is going to be using this to shop for a fucking rug? Come on; give some real-life examples that are IMPORTANT. None of these were.
5. The entire presentation's style, across multiple different presenters,  was...exhausting...halting...jarring 
I'm more curious how the display works.  I had Google Goggles.  The display was nearly impossible to see and gave me a headache going crosseyed trying.  If the hardware can overlay well, and be easy to see, someone will write the software for it eventually.  If it can't, then no amount of software will work.
Really the glasses itself should be dumb.  Put all the smarts in a smartphone app with a plugin architecture.  Have it voice controlled where you say a keyword then parse your next sentence for a command 
The idea is that it's always on your face and hands free, and due to the location of the display you don't need to look down-  it overlays your normal field of vision with additional information (that's the entire point of AR).  But yes, other than overlaying your actual field of vision there's nothing it could do that a phone couldn't.

14,2025-10-31,"A second solid gold toilet is to be auctioned off, after the first casting was stolen from Blenheim Palace in 2019.
America, created by Italian conceptual artist Maurizio Cattelan, is a fully functional toilet, fashioned from more than 15st 13lb (101.2kg) of solid 18-carat gold.
The first version of the work was initially installed in a public bathroom at the  Guggenheim museum in New York in 2016 but hit the news again three years later when a gang of thieves stole it from Blenheim in Oxfordshire. 
Now the existence of a second golden toilet has been revealed, which is due to go under the hammer at Sotheby's in New York City on 18 November.
It is estimated more than 100,000 people used the first toilet while it was at the Guggenheim before it was moved and exhibited at Blenheim Palace.
It was there that in the early hours of 14 September 2019, five men smashed their way in, ripped out the £4.8m solid gold installation and fled in a stolen Volkswagen Golf.
The heist and the trial that followed made news across the world.    
James Sheen, 40, from Oxford, pleaded guilty to burglary and transferring criminal property in 2024. Michael Jones, 39, from Oxford, was found guilty of burglary in March. Both were both jailed earlier this year.
Fred Doe, 36, from Windsor, was also convicted of conspiracy to transfer criminal property and given a suspended sentence.
Sotheby's has revealed that Cattelan created three toilets in 2016, with work number two now up for sale.
The second version will be on display in a bathroom at New York's Breuer Building until it goes under the hammer.
The auction house described it as a ""cultural phenomenon"" and an ""incisive commentary on the collision of artistic production and commodity value"".
David Galperin, head of contemporary art at Sotheby's New York, said: ""America is Maurizio Cattelan's tour de force.""
""Holding both a proverbial and literal mirror to the art world, the work confronts the most uncomfortable questions about art, and the belief systems held sacred to the institutions of the market and the museum,"" Mr Galperin explained.
The auction house said that in a world first, the starting bid on the artwork would be determined by the exact price of its weight in gold when the sale begins.
That means, if sold at today's rate, bidding on the solid gold toilet would begin at around $10m (£7.6m).

Japanese newspaper The Sankei Shimbun and the Kyodo news agency are reporting thatÂ Super Sentaiâthe long-running tokusatsu franchise that paved the way for the ’90sÂ Power Rangers boom in the westâmay come to an end after 50 years.
Both reports (via Anime News Network) suggest that series owner Toei will end the series with the climax of the currently airing No. 1 Sentai Gozyuger, which began broadcast earlier this year, citing budgetary concerns, with profits from Super Sentai merchandise, as well as events such as movies and live show tours, failing to match the series’ production costs.
Gozyuger is the 49th series since the franchise began in 1975 with Himitsu Sentai GorengerâSuper Sentai has aired yearly almost entirely consecutively ever since, save for a single year, 1978, when Toei’s Spider-Man series took its place, part of a partnership with Marvel Comics that would see the publisher help fund several more Super Sentai series: Battle Fever J, Denshi Sentai Denjiman, and Taiyo Sentai Sun Vulcan.Â Gozyuger technically follows the 50th official Super Sentai team, as the 2018 series Kaitou Sentai Lupinranger VS Keisatsu Sentai Patranger featured two rival teams and is celebrating the franchise’s 50th anniversary.
Neither Toei nor TV Asahi, the network that currently airs Super Sentai, has publicly commented on the reports; however, rumors have circulated recently of a potential soft reboot and rebrand of the franchise, paving the way for a Super Sentai-esque series to take its place after Gozyuger. Although it’s not happened yet this year, it’s usually around November when the next Super Sentai series’ title emerges through trademark filings in Japan, which may reveal plans to move the series away from its current branding. Earlier this year, speaking toÂ Daily Sports Online, series producer ShinichirÃ´ Shirakura suggested that a new series was in development.
“I think Gozyuger is a program that retells the history of Super Sentai, including redefining the warriors of the past,” a machine translation of Shirakura’s comments reads. “That’s why the 51st series can’t just be an extension of that. I believe the program itself has to move on to the next stage… and we’re currently in the midst of building it!”
AlongsideÂ Kamen Rider, which has been running similarly since 1971 (albeit with an extended hiatus between 1989 and 2000),Â Super Sentai has been a staple of Japanese children’s television and is seen as a potential stepping stone for young actors looking to begin their careers in film and TV. Beyond its own legacy in its home territory, of course, Super Sentai will forever be linked to theÂ Power RangersÂ franchise in the west. The series, starting with 1992’s KyÅryÅ« Sentai Zyuranger, provided suit, creature, and mecha designs forÂ Power Rangers, as well as parts of its action footage, for decades.
That may change, with current Power Rangers owner Hasbro not having aired a series since 2023’s Power Rangers Cosmic Fury. A reboot of the franchise is currently in the works at Disney+, and just what potential relationship it may have withÂ Super SentaiÂ material remains to be seen. And inversely, shouldÂ Super Sentai end withÂ Gozyuger and begin with a new name or format, that could likewise open Toei up away fromÂ Power Rangers‘ global branding and begin to market the series more widely around the world, something it has struggled to do in comparison toÂ Kamen Rider recentlyâwhichÂ began offering U.S. simulcasts of its latest series, Kamen Rider Zeztz, for the first time in the series’ history this year.

In between trying to become the world’s first trillionaire, expanding his defense contracting business, fighting the “woke mind virus,” feuding with Sam Altman, and overseeing half a dozen tech companies, Elon Musk has somehow found the time to wade into the debate over whether it’s good or bad that a rogue Waymo robotaxi (by the company’s own admission) seems to have run over and killed a beloved bodega cat in San Francisco.
In case you somehow missed it, a cat was run over earlier this week, leading to ongoing anger against the reputed culprit (Waymo). The feline, whose name was KitKatâbut who also went by the moniker “the mayor of 16th street”âwas a longtime staple of Randaâs Market in the city’s Mission neighborhood. KitKat’s owner, Mike Zeidan, told The San Francisco Standard that his pet was hit by a robotaxi late Monday night. âHonestly, man, itâs difficult,” Zeidan said. “He was a one-of-a-kind cat. He brought joy to so many people. People loved him.â
Waymo seems to have admitted that its vehicle did, indeed, run over KitKat. âWe reviewed this, and while our vehicle was stopped to pick up passengers, a nearby cat darted under our vehicle as it was pulling away,â a company spokesperson told Gizmodo. âWe send our deepest sympathies to the catâs owner and the community who knew and loved him.â
On Friday, as a means of adding his two cents, Musk retweeted an account that had defended driverless cars as being a savior, not a killer, of neighborhood pets. â5.4 million cats are hit by cars every year in the U.S., and 97 percent of those cats die from their injuries,â @WholeMarsBlog wrote. âAutonomy will dramatically reduce that number.â
âTrue, many pets will be saved by autonomy,â Musk commented.
It’s great that Elon could take time out of his busy schedule to participate in the discourse around KitKat. Big picture, Musk is launching a robotaxi service, so we all know which dog he has in this fight. But the truth of the matter is, we don’t really know if autonomous cars would reduce the number of feline deaths.
One of the primary selling points for robotaxis has been that human drivers are notorious for running into things, crashing, and otherwise causing dangerous mayhem on America’s roadways. And it’s true that human drivers can be absurdly dangerous. That said, the jury is still out on whether robotaxis are actually that much safer than human drivers. Speed is a factor in a significant portion of traffic fatalities, and robotaxis have so far steered clear of those speeds. At the same time, there’s also the fact that, whether robotaxis are safer or not, part of living in a free society involves accepting a certain amount of risk attached to that freedom. Currently, anyone can get into a car and drive it where they want to go, regardless of what the software in the car is programmed to do. That won’t necessarily be the case in a world governed by robotaxis.

Happy Halloween! Keep an eye out for AI-inspired costumes tonight. (Just good luck trying to automate trick-or-treating!)
In case you missed it, I had a fantastic discussion with Eugene Kim and Aki Ito yesterday about the Amazon layoffs and its wider impact across corporate America. Luckily, you can watch a replay of the whole discussion here.
In today's big story, tech earnings have finally wrapped. Here's what you need to know.
What's on deck:
Markets: The former McKinsey executive who is Zohran Mamdani's bridge to NYC's C-suite.
Tech: Who got rich from Navan's IPO?
Business: The era of the never-ending layoff might be here.
But first, give me the CliffNotes.
If this was forwarded to you, sign up here.
If you blinked, you might have missed it.
Earnings season hit Big Tech, and there's a lot to unpack. (And a lot of AI spending going on.) Five of the world's most important companies provided updates on their businesses over the course of two days.
To quickly catch you up on how things shook out, here's a rundown on the main takeaways from Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft.
But first, a quick plug for my colleague Alistair Barr's newsletter. Tech Memo is a must-subscribe if you even have a slight interest in the industry, so do yourself a favor and click here.
Ok, let's dive in.
Alphabet: Hot on ChatGPT's heels.
Look out, OpenAI. Here comes Gemini. Google's chatbot now has 650 million monthly active users. That's about a 44% jump from just a few months ago.
Sure, it still trails the behemoth that is ChatGPT, which has a staggering 800 million weekly active users. But the growth shows Gemini is building momentum, and especially with the youths.
Josh Woodward, the VP of Google Labs who leads the Gemini app, told BI's Hugh Langley there has been a big demographic shift to younger users. That's thanks to its viral image editor Nano Banana.
Microsoft: Spend, spend, spend.
Spending big on AI infrastructure was already a massive theme in tech heading into earnings, and Microsoft certainly didn't stray from the path. An internal memo from CFO Amy Hood seen by BI's Ashley Stewart highlighted the company's record $34.9 billion infrastructure spending to meet AI demand this quarter.
Investors aren't necessarily buying it, as concerns are growing about whether all this money will lead to some ROI.
Meta: Oh, you think that's a lot of tech spending? Hold my beer.
Meta has never shied away from its intent to spend big on AI. That proved true this week when it bumped its estimate for infrastructure spend this year to between $70 billion and $72 billion. The number raised plenty of questions for Mark Zuckerberg.
Perhaps his answers didn't land quite the right way. Meta's stock tumbled more than 11% on Thursday.
Meta's commitment to AI is clear, but loyalty to a trend is a fickle thing at the tech giant. Remember the good old metaverse? It got zero mentions from Meta executives on Wednesday's call.
Apple: Big trouble in China.
The iPhone maker delivered an earnings beat, with revenue growing 8% year over year.
However, things weren't so bright in China, an important market for Apple. Revenue was actually down compared to a year ago, and it's not like 2024 was a banner year for Apple in the country either.
Amazon: Layoffs? What layoffs?
Only a few days removed from cutting 14,000 corporate employees, Amazon reported some big wins in earnings. There was huge growth, particularly when it came to its somewhat beleaguered cloud unit.
As for those layoffs, CEO Andy Jassy offered some clarity about the motivation. According to Jassy, it wasn't about AI or even cost savings. It was because they didn't fit the culture, he said.
1. Meet Zohran Mamdani's CEO whisperer. Former McKinsey executive and Ayn Rand fan Yasser Salem has become the democratic socialist candidate's bridge to New York's C-suite. Salem hopes to turn skeptics into partners and told BI that he has met with over 70 CEOs to discuss their concerns.
2. Hedge funds are on track for a banner year. Despite an array of macroeconomic headwinds, the industry is set to have its best annual showing since the pandemic, according to fund administrator Citco. Multistrategy funds are leading the way, with an average return of 19.3%.
3. JPMorgan wants everyone in its 300,000 workforce to become AI pros. America's biggest bank is rolling out a firmwide AI training push, but it'll affect different workers in different ways, chief analytics officer Derek Waldron said in an interview with McKinsey. The multi-pronged strategy is helping people get comfortable, he said.
1. Navan finally makes its (public) debut. The travel and expense management company has become the largest to test the IPO waters during a government shutdown. BI calculated the numbers — and these are the big VC winners.
2. Use AI, but don't depend on it. Many bosses are encouraging workers to lean in on AI, but some are also worried workers could forget how to do their jobs without it.
3. AI is starting to take a bite out of Wikipedia's traffic. Wiki reported its traffic is down 8% in the last few months when compared to the same time last year, and AI summaries and chatbots that aggregate its data are largely to blame. BI's Katie Notopoulos explores whether Wikipedia is in trouble or not.
1. The world's most important economic relationship just got a reset. Donald Trump and Xi Jinping emerged from their first IRL meeting in six years with warmth and progress. Beneath the diplomatic niceties, three major business takeaways stood out.
2. The rise of the rolling layoff. Companies like Amazon and Paramount Skydance have conducted multiple rounds of layoffs recently, leaving some employees relieved that they held onto their jobs but fearing they might be next. That can be pretty bad for morale and productivity. Here's why companies do it anyway.
3. Slop bowl stocks slump. Chipotle's stock fell 18% missing consensus Q3 revenue estimates. The fast-food chain revealed a significant decline in customer traffic among Gen Z and millennials, which prompted a reduced outlook. Competitors Sweetgreen and Cava also saw their stocks fall.

""Sorry, we used the wrong buzzwords & PHBese, making shareholders nervous. Therefore, we are issuing new buzzwords & PHBese to describe our shrinkage without directly admitting we are shrinking.""
This was meant for the Amazon article, not Adobe. I apologize.
Once you reach market saturation on ethically-licensed software, you can't grow, so you have to get everyone using a subscription to give the appearance of growth. At some point, though, everyone has ""upgraded"" to the subscription model, and you've once again slammed into the wall of no additional customers that need your product. It's all downhill from there. Rather convenient that this AI crap came around exactly at the time the companies that switched to subscriptions were at their saturation points and needed a new subscription to sell.
Also, Adobe has, in fact, been on the AI bandwagon, it's just nobody wants the crap.
and 12/1/25 they'll start charging for generative AI tools built into their new $750/year subscription plan. FUCK THOSE GUYS

I don't even watch tv anymore, but I think that if YouTube is issuing a credit, that's fair. Many cable providers don't even carry any of the Disney/ABC/ESPN channels anymore precisely because Disney charges too fucking much, mainly because they bundle a lot of very expensive shit into a package deal where most people only watch a fraction of it and just don't get their money's worth. Probably high time the whole industry tells them to go fuck themselves.

Disney does this every time it negotiates its contract, and it is always during Football season.  I used to work for Sling they did this to us twice while I worked there.


This is how live television actually works these days.  Disney has a pile of channels that they can't hardly give away.  Remember, we aren't talking about shows (although most shows don't matter either).  We are talking about channels.  When was the last time you channel surfed trying to find something on the air?

20,2025-10-31,"ABC, ESPN, and other Disney channels are no longer available on YouTube TV.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

YouTube TV and Disney are feuding over content rights, and the two sides failed to come to an agreement before the Oct. 30, 2025 deadline. As of now, all Disney channels are blacked out on YouTube TV, and that includes both live channels and recordings stored in your library.
The blackout affects 21 channels, all of which are now unavailable on YouTube TV, including big names like ABC, ESPN, and The Disney Channel. It follows warnings from YouTube TV and Disney last week that the channels would go dark if the deadline passed.
""Each time we renew our contracts with network partners, we advocate for fair pricing and greater flexibility to offer our subscribers the best possible live TV experience,"" Google said in a support document. ""Our current agreement with Disney has approached its renewal date, and we will not agree to terms that disadvantage our members while benefiting Disney’s own live TV products.""
Despite our best efforts, we have not been able to reach a fair deal, and starting today, Disney programming will not be available on YouTube TV. This means you will no longer be able to watch channels like ABC and ESPN or access recordings from these networks in your Library.October 31, 2025
Both companies took to social media to defend their positions, with the official YouTube TV account on X (formerly Twitter) saying it is ""committed to continuing to work with Disney to reach an agreement."" The blackout began during Scott Van Pelt's show on ESPN, who shared a link to keepmynetworks.com on his personal X account. The site encourages YouTube TV subscribers to contact Google and demand Disney channels.
 



""Unfortunately, Google’s YouTube TV has chosen to deny their subscribers the content they value most by refusing to pay fair rates for our channels, including ESPN and ABC,"" Disney said in a statement to Yahoo. The company also called out YouTube TV's parent company, Google, alleging it is using ""market dominance to eliminate competition.""
YouTube TV says that if it can't reach a deal with Disney and content remains unavailable for ""an extended period of time,"" it will offer subscribers a $20 credit.
Without a new agreement in place, their subscribers will not have access to our programming, which includes the best lineup in live sports – anchored by the NFL, NBA, and college football, with 13 of the top 25 college teams playing this weekend. With a $3 trillion market cap, Google is using its market dominance to eliminate competition and undercut the industry-standard terms we’ve successfully negotiated with every other distributor.
Google claims Disney is trying to benefit its own live TV streaming products, which compete with YouTube TV. Just this week, Disney closed its acquisition of Fubo, which will merge with Hulu with Live TV — immediately making Disney's live TV product the second-largest, trailing only YouTube TV.
Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android
Last week Disney used the threat of a blackout on YouTube TV as a negotiating tactic to force deal terms that would raise prices on our customers. They’re now following through on that threat, suspending their content on YouTube TV. This decision directly harms our subscribers while benefiting their own live TV products, including Hulu + Live TV and Fubo.
Disney channels will remain off YouTube TV until if and when a deal is reached, and this displaces the following stations: ESPN, ESPN2, Freeform, FX, FXX, Disney Junior, SEC Network, Nat Geo, Nat Geo Wild, Disney Channel, ESPNU, FXM, ABC News Live, ACC Network, Disney XD, Localish, ESPNews, ESPN Deportes (Spanish Plan), Baby TV Español (Spanish Plan), and Nat Geo Mundo (Spanish Plan).
YouTube TV successfully navigated similar negotiations with NBCUniversal, Fox, and Paramount over content rights in 2025. We'll have to wait and see whether it can do the same with Disney, and how long it might take to come to a resolution.

    Watching the NBA is very different this season and more difficult than in the past. Here's what you need to know.
  
After the flood of nostalgia from hearing Roundball Rock on the first NBA on NBC broadcast in more than two decades receded, NBA fans were likely left with a mix of confusion and frustration over the first 10 days of the season. There are more national broadcasts this year, but finding them is harder than it should be.  
This season, it's no longer as simple as flipping on the TV and searching two or three channels to find the game. To watch every national NBA game this season requires three separate streaming services. Life is hard enough; watching sports shouldn't increase this feeling. 
Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.
The 2025-26 season marks the first under the NBA's new media-rights deal, which will end the NBA on TNT era and bring games back to NBC. It also pushes the NBA into the streaming era with games appearing on Peacock and Prime Video each week of the season, as well as ESPN's new direct-to-consumer streaming service.  
Here's what you need to know about the new NBA media landscape and where to find which games on which nights on which streaming services.  
Victor Wembanyama has quickly become a must-watch talent, but figuring out how to watch or stream San Antonio Spurs games this season feels harder than it should be.
This season is the first in the new 11-year deal between the NBA and its three media partners: Disney (ABC/ESPN), NBCUniversal (NBC/Peacock) and Amazon (Prime Video). There will be 247 national broadcasts across this trio this season, which far outpaces last season's 172 national games. 
Last year, you just needed a single live TV streaming service like Sling or YouTube TV that had ABC, ESPN and TNT for the national broadcasts each week of the season. Now, with exclusive Peacock games and the Prime Video slate, that one-streamer convenience is as outdated as the midrange jumpshot. 
Here's the breakdown of the national broadcasts: 
Jalen Brunson and the New York Knicks will be part of a national broadcast a league-high 34 times this season. 
There will be a national NBA broadcast four nights a week all season long: 
Starting midseason after the NFL and college football seasons are over, the schedule will expand to every night of the week and weekend afternoons with these additions: 
One last item for NBA fans: the best studio show in sports, Inside the NBA, will make the jump from TNT to ESPN this season. The 21-time Emmy award-winning show will still be filmed in its Atlanta studio and will still feature Ernie Johnson, Charles Barkley, Shaquille O'Neal and Kenny Smith. What has changed is the show's schedule. Instead of weekly broadcasts, Inside the NBA will take place more sporadically around marquee regular-season matchups, Christmas Day games, and during the playoffs, including the conference finals and NBA finals. 
Led by league MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the Oklahoma City Thunder are favorites to repeat as NBA champions entering the 2025-26 season.
While you can watch many games on ABC, ESPN and NBC during the season with a cable TV or live TV streaming service, you'll miss out on the streaming-only games featured on Peacock and Prime Video.  
For full coverage, NBA fans will need to subscribe to a trio of streaming services: Peacock, Prime Video and ESPN for a combined total of $50 a month. (If you're already an Amazon Prime subscriber for the free two-day shipping and view it as a sunk cost, then ESPN and Peacock would cost you $41 a month.) 
NBA games are back on NBC for the first time since 2002. NBC and Peacock will broadcast 100 regular-season games, including exclusive Peacock games on Monday nights, and the All-Star Game. Doubleheaders will be shown on NBC and Peacock on Tuesday nights, with the earlier game shown on NBC in the Eastern and Central time zones and the later game shown on NBC in the Mountain and Pacific time zones. Starting on Feb. 1, NBC and Peacock will show NBA games on Sunday nights.
You can stream every NBA broadcast on NBC with Peacock's $11-per-month Premium plan. Read our Peacock review.
There's nothing new about having NBA games on ABC and ESPN, but this season you can watch these games without cable TV or a live TV streaming service thanks to ESPN's new direct-to-consumer streaming service.
For NBA fans, an ESPN Unlimited subscription will let you watch 80 regular-season games -- that includes games shown on ESPN and ABC. It will show Wednesday night doubleheaders throughout the season before adding Friday night doubleheaders and Saturday night and Sunday afternoon games starting midseason.
The ESPN Unlimited plan costs $30 a month (or $300 a year) and lets you stream all of ESPN's linear networks: ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, ESPNews, ESPN Deportes, SEC Network and ACC Network. You also get access to programming on ESPN on ABC, ESPN Plus, ESPN3, SECN Plus and ACCNX. Read our ESPN Unlimited review.
(There's also a $13-a-month ESPN Select plan, which is basically a rebranding of ESPN Plus. With it, you'll have access to thousands of live games -- think small college conferences, whose games you can't watch anywhere else -- but not the NBA.)
Prime Video will stream 66 regular-season games this season, mostly Friday night doubleheaders that will include the group rounds of the NBA Cup in-season tournament. It will also show knockout rounds and championship game of the NBA Cup as well as a Black Friday game and two global games in Europe (Jan. 15 in Berlin and Jan. 18 in London). Also in January after the NFL and college football seasons are over, Prime Video's NBA schedule will expand to include games on Thursday nights and Saturday afternoons.
Prime Video is included with an Amazon Prime subscription for $15 a month or $139 a year. You can also subscribe only to Prime Video for $9 a month. Read our Prime Video review.
If you're, say, a Celtics fan in Boston, a Knicks fan in New York or a Lakers fan in Los Angeles and care more about following your local team than watching national broadcasts, then you'll need to subscribe to a TV service that carries your team's regional sports network. Most RSNs are either part of the FanDuel Sports Network or NBC Sports Network. The two live TV streaming services with the most RSNs are DirecTV and Fubo.  
You can also subscribe to a FanDuel Sports Network RSN through Prime Video and an NBC Sports RSN via Peacock. Also, a handful of teams -- the Dallas Mavericks, Lakers, New Orleans Pelicans, Phoenix Suns, Portland Trail Blazers and Utah Jazz -- offer an in-market streaming option through NBA League Pass.  
Meanwhile, NBA League Pass remains the pick for serious fans who want to be able to watch every out-of-market game every night of the season. The basic plan with commercials costs $110 for the season. The premium plan costs $160 for the season and replaces commercials with the in-arena feed, adds the ability to download games and highlights for offline viewing, and lets you watch on up to three devices at once.

Novo Nordisk has launched a rival bid for U.S. obesity biotech firm Metsera, directly challenging an existing offer from Pfizer.
The move, announced Thursday, escalates the competition between the two pharmaceutical giants for a critical advantage in the highly lucrative weight-loss drug market. Novo Nordisk, already dominant with its blockbuster drugs Wegovy and Ozempic, bid up to $8.5 billion. This offer surpasses Pfizer's bid of $7.3 billion and includes a significant $6 billion upfront payment, with the remaining amount structured as later milestone payments.
See, Pfizer has shown impressive rallies, with its stock climbing more than 30% in less than two months during 2021. These rapid increases have provided investors with considerable returns. If similar drivers materialize, Pfizer shares could be set for another considerable rise, continuing its history of fast, strong rallies.
PFE stock may fluctuate. A balanced allocation doesn’t. Trefis’ Boston-based wealth management partner combines strategy and discipline to mitigate market noise.
It is certainly beneficial if the fundamentals are sound. For details on PFE, read Buy or Sell PFE Stock. Below are some important numbers.
Examining Pfizer’s stock during challenging periods reveals that risk is still a reality, even with robust fundamentals. The stock declined approximately 39% during the Dot-Com Bubble and dropped even further by 53% in the Global Financial Crisis. The corrections in 2018 and the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in decreases of about 24% and 29%, respectively. The inflation shock was particularly severe, leading Pfizer to plummet by over 53%. See – How Low Can Pfizer Stock Really Go – for more details. Therefore, even with the company’s strong standing, market downturns have severely impacted it. Quality is important; however, during significant sell-offs, few stocks manage to avoid considerable losses.
Investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics."

Corporate America has touted artificial intelligence as the start of a new era of productivity, but Goldman Sachs' latest report suggests job cuts are already on the horizon.
Goldman's analysis is based on a survey of 105 Goldman bankers, who service clients across various industries. It offers a behind-the-scenes look at how major US companies are actually utilizing AI and what that means for their workforces.
The survey found that companies are primarily turning to AI to boost productivity and revenue — not to slash costs — with nearly half of banking clients using the technology to drive growth. This compares with just one in five deploying it primarily to cut expenses.
Meanwhile, only about one in 10 firms has reduced head count so far due to AI, though nearly a third of bankers covering technology, media, and telecom clients report early signs of job pressure.
Still, the bankers expect AI to start trimming payrolls soon. They forecast a 4% reduction in head count over the next year, followed by a deeper 11% cut within three years.
""The relatively fast increase in expected adoption and head count reductions over the next three years highlights that AI impacts on the US labor market could arrive sooner than expected,"" wrote Goldman's analysts, led by chief economist Jan Hatzius, in a Thursday note.
About 55% of Goldman's bankers expect clients to rely on hiring freezes or natural attrition as AI reshapes roles, while 26% anticipate layoffs or broader restructuring.
Goldman's bankers also see the most significant potential for AI-driven reductions in head count in customer support, where 80% of respondents expect cuts as automation takes hold. Other positions at risk include those in administrative support, operations at 49%, and IT and engineering.
Goldman's report lands amid a wave of recent layoffs that underscore how quickly workforce reductions are spreading beyond traditional cost-cutting drives.
Earlier this week, tech giant Amazon cut 14,000 jobs with CEO Andy Jassy saying the cuts were driven by cultural fit — not cost savings or AI.
Still, the timing highlights how technology is reshaping hiring across sectors.
""The relatively high current and expected adoption rates for US corporates and meaningful expected head count reductions support our long-standing view that AI is set to have a transformative impact on the labor market and economy,"" they wrote.
Goldman's forecast for job losses reflects the rapid adoption of AI by companies.
Goldman's bankers report that 37% of clients are already using AI for regular production — significantly above the Census Bureau's recent survey, which showed a 9.9% adoption rate.
They expect the share of overall adoption to rise to 50% next year and 74% within three years, suggesting a rapid acceleration as AI tools become more embedded in day-to-day operations.
Yet many companies remain cautious. About 61% of Goldman's bankers said clients view AI as ""too early a technology"" to deploy widely, and 47% said firms lack the in-house expertise to build the right tools.

24,2025-10-31,"A nearly 12,000-square-foot mansion on the market in the exclusive Stone Creek Ranch community west of Delray Beach offers 2.5 acres of waterfront land, nine garage bays, and the extra rare amenity of being neighbors with actor, entrepreneur and former rapper Mark Wahlberg.
The opportunity to rub elbows with the A-list celebrity carries a $21.99 million price tag, which also includes the French Riviera-style six-bedroom, seven-bathroom home at 9303 Hawk Shadow Lane.
Described as a “rare infusion of architectural brilliance, natural beauty, and adrenaline fueled elegance”, the home has a private wing for the primary suite with dual bathrooms, an office, custom-designed boutique-style closets and European white oak floors.
The kitchen is anchored by a Calacatta Crema marble island. The ovens are Wolf. The views are of water, and the lighting fixtures are designed with Selenite crystals, which are promoted as having the power to remove negative energy and instill calmness.
The home is also across a small lake from the estate purchased by Wahlberg in October for a recorded $32.6 million. The multiple listing service shows the house sold for a total of $37 million, which can happen if other items such as furniture or artwork are included in the deal.  
Douglas Elliman agent Senada Adzem, who has completed more than a dozen sales in the private 37-home Stone Creek Ranch, is the listing agent for 9303 Hawk Shadow Lane. The home, dubbed Villa Ananda, was built in 2018 by owners who are car enthusiasts with an affinity for Lamborghinis.
While there are nine air-conditioned car bays, Adzem said expandable lifts could accommodate up to 18 vehicles. The arrival area of the home was also designed to handle race car carriers.
Adzem, who was also the listing agent for the home Wahlberg purchased, said Stone Creek Ranch has gained a reputation for being an enclave for the super-affluent, earning it the nickname “billionaires row.”
“It is attracting high profile businesspeople and celebrities, either in sports or entertainment, because of its privacy and security,” she said. “There are many billionaire residents in here whose names are not known and who own under opaque limited liability corporations to remain private.”
Villa Ananda has most recently been on the market beginning Sept. 16. Adzem said on Oct. 30 that she had shown the home to two celebrities and an affluent businessman. She declined to comment on their identities.
Billionaire hedge fund manager and New York Mets owner Steve Cohen owns a home in Stone Creek Ranch. Celebrity shoppers who have perused Stone Creek Ranch estates recently include singer-songwriter Alicia Keys and 2021 Super Bowl halftime performer The Weeknd, whose real name is Abel Makkonen Tesfaye.
Soccer star Lionel Messi also looked in Stone Creek Ranch before settling on a Fort Lauderdale home.
The community is about 8 miles from the beach and six miles from the Boca Raton Airport, but closer to private schools such as Pine Crest and Saint Andrew’s.
While Palm Beach County has a few areas dubbed ""billionaire's row"", including in the Town of Palm Beach, Stone Creek Ranch's increasing sales prices put it at the top of the market for homes west of I-95 and without ocean access.
In November 2024, a home dubbed Villa Spectre sold for $55 million off market, according to the listing agent, with a recorded deed reflecting a $36.8 million sale. The home next door, Casa Maranello, sold in January for $50.5 million per the multiple listing service with a recorded deed of $41.5 million.
Both homes were designed by Aldo Stark of Prestige Design Homes, who is reportedly working on a home in the community that will list for $75 million.
Other homes listed for sale as of Oct. 31 include one for $23 million and another for $47.5 million.
Villa Ananda at 9303 Hawk Shadow Lane was built in 2018 with gardens designed by Boca Raton-based landscape architect Krent Wieland. Instead of the ubiquitous palm trees, the grounds are planted with Italian cypress, roses, bougainvillea, and Japanese blueberry trees.
“The owners are big health and wellness fans,” Adzem said. “They were strategic and intentional when building the home.”

The same week that Nvidia became the world’s first $5 trillion company, significantly propelled by its AI-related investments and products, Meta’s stock had its worst day in three years because traders fear that Meta has overspent on AI. 
As CNBC reports, Meta shares dropped more than 11% on Thursday and have thus far dropped another 1.3% so far today, as of writing. At its bottom yesterday, October 30, Meta’s share price reached its lowest point in three years. 
Meta, like many tech companies, is frantically racing to improve its AI technology and tools. The stock market fears that Meta’s aggressive capital expenditures on AI are perhaps too aggressive and are arguably unlikely to pay off. 
During an earnings call on Wednesday, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended the company’s AI spending, which is a huge chunk of overall annual capital expenditures nearing $72 billion. 
“It’s pretty early, but I think we’re seeing the returns in the core business. That’s giving us a lot of confidence that we should be investing a lot more, and we want to make sure that we’re not underinvesting,” Zuckerberg said during the call. 
Meta is far from alone in its massive AI spending. CNBC notes that Alphabet, Google’s parent company, increased its projected expenditures to $93 billion, while Microsoft indicated that it also expects to spend more this year than in 2024. 
Although Meta had a disastrous day yesterday, its stock value is still up over 9.5% so far in 2025. 
Nonetheless, as MarketWatch wrote yesterday, “There’s an AI bubble.” There are many failed AI startups, and spending is unsustainable. 
However, MarketWatch argues that the biggest players, including Meta, are “essentially unassailable.” The economics publication claims that these companies are so big, and their core businesses so successful, that even “extended periods of disappointing AI returns” won’t sink the ships. 
This aligns, at least in part, with what Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said this week. As reported by Fortune, Powell claims that most of the AI-related spending is being done by successful companies with actual earnings, rather than speculative spenders. Powell says the AI bubble, if there is one, is not like the dot-com bubble.  
But massive companies have failed before, sometimes in catastrophic fashion. Whether investors’ worst fears may be realized, there is clearly a general uneasiness about how at least some companies, including massive ones, are approaching AI.

Zoetis (ZTS) stock warrants your attention. Why? Because it offers high margins – indicative of pricing power and the ability to generate cash – at a discounted price. Here is some information.
Though revenue growth is beneficial, this is not a perspective focused solely on growth. Pricing power and high margins facilitate consistent, predictable profits and cash flows, which mitigate risk and enable reinvestment of capital. The market tends to reward such characteristics.
For some background, Zoetis offers medicines, vaccines, and diagnostic products for animal health across a variety of livestock species, aimed at preventing diseases that impact the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and reproductive systems.
Do these figures, however, convey the complete picture? Check Buy or Sell ZTS Stock to determine if Zoetis maintains an advantage that is still relevant.
Would you prefer to purchase one stock that resonates with you, or construct a portfolio designed to excel through various market cycles? Our analysis indicates that High Quality Portfolio has transformed uncertainty in stock picking into consistent market outperformance. This portfolio is part of the asset allocation strategy employed by Trefis’ wealth management partner based in Boston – whose asset allocation framework generated positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P faced a decline of over 40%.
Stocks Like These Have The Potential To Outperform. Here Are The Facts
This is our selection method: We target stocks with a market capitalization exceeding $10 billion and then exclude those with elevated CFO (cash flow from operations) margins or operating margins. Additionally, we only consider stocks that have significantly decreased in value over the last year.
Below are the statistics for stocks subjected to this selection methodology since December 31, 2016.
However, Pay Attention To The Risks
ZTS is not immune to significant declines. It fell close to 17% during the correction in 2018, 36% amid the Covid pandemic, and nearly 47% in response to inflationary shocks. Even with strong financial fundamentals, the stock can suffer substantial losses when the market experiences downturns. High quality may cushion risks, but it doesn’t eliminate them.
Nevertheless, the risks are not restricted to major market crashes. Stocks can drop even when the market conditions are favorable – consider events such as earnings announcements, business updates, or changes in outlook. Read ZTS Dip Buyer Analyses to explore how the stock has bounced back from significant declines in the past.
The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which comprises 30 stocks, has consistently demonstrated outperformance against its benchmark that encompasses all three indices – the S&P 500, S&P Mid-Cap, and Russell 2000. What accounts for this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded superior returns with reduced risk when compared to the benchmark index; they offer a smoother investment experience, as illustrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics."
28,2025-10-31,"Apple is building up inventory for its first foldable iPhone in preparation for the device's launch next year, claims a Chinese leaker with proven sources within Apple's supply chain.
According to Weibo-based account Fixed Focus Digital, Apple is now stockpiling key components for its long-rumored foldable iPhone, which we are tentatively referring to as ""iPhone Fold."" The leaker did not elaborate, but Apple is likely securing supplies of advanced parts including foldable OLED displays, titanium frames, and complex hinge assemblies that reportedly combine several materials. 
The move suggests Apple is entering the crucial pre-production phase, where suppliers begin ramping output ahead of full mass production. Some of these components may have long lead times and high failure rates, so early stock-building helps reduce risk and smooth the eventual launch pipeline. 
Apple's foldable iPhone is reportedly similar in style to Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold, which uses a book-style folding mechanism, rather than the clamshell design of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip.
When folded, users will interact with a 5.5-inch outer display that is similar to a typical iPhone screen, while unfolding it will reveal a larger 7.8-inch iPad-style screen. The inner display is said to be virtually crease-free, with some sources claiming it features an under-screen camera. The outer screen is said to have a punch-hole camera, while authentication is handled by Touch ID integrated into the side button, rather than Face ID. There's also a dual-lens camera on the rear.
According to analyst Jeff Pu, the frame is made from a mix of titanium and aluminum. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has also said Apple is using multiple materials, but he believes the main ones are titanium and stainless steel. Kuo also believes some hinge components will be made from Liquidmetal for further durability.
The foldable ‌iPhone‌ is rumored to be as thin as 4.5mm when opened up, which would make it even thinner than the ‌iPhone Air, so titanium is likely being used to prevent bending issues‌. With display and mechanical engineering challenges unlike any current iPhone, Apple's logistical groundwork hints that its first foldable device may finally be nearing reality. The ‌iPhone Fold‌ is expected to be part of the iPhone 18 lineup, launching in September 2026.

Are we in a stock market bubble or not? Let’s tackle that question head-on, because it’s all we seem to be hearing about these days.
I’ll put my cards on the table: We’re not in a bubble. I’m going to show you why I’m still bullish on stocks at these levels. Then we’re going to play overwrought bubble fears with a “cornerstone” fund that’s beaten stocks over just about every timeline but is still cheap (and yields a rich 8%, too).
When it comes to stocks, the truth is, there’s a good reason why they keep rising: We’re in a booming economy.
Of course, you might not feel that way—many communities across America are suffering. Income inequality, crime, corruption—it’s a mess out there. Those are all serious problems, to be sure. But just as the stock market is not the economy, the stock market is not society, either, and those problems can co-exist with a rising market.
Stocks are rising because their moves are tied to one thing: earnings. And earnings are soaring.
Bloomberg recently reported on something we’ve been talking about for a while here at Contrarian Outlook and in my CEF Insider service: Earnings are growing as companies improve their profits through efficiency gains, some of which are driven by AI.
In fact, the earnings beats we’re seeing come from across the economy, from companies as diverse as General Motors (GM), Coca-Cola (KO), Morgan Stanley (MS) and, of course, tech names like Broadcom (AVGO) and Lam Research (LRCX).
While tech continues to be the top-performing sector, there’s good reason to expect that more and more gains will come from outside of tech, as new innovations spread from that sector into other parts of the economy.
This doesn’t mean we should simply avoid tech and buy the rest of the market. After all, tech’s earnings gains are the strongest out there and will likely remain so, although financials are a close second.
At a time like this, we want broad-based market exposure. But of course, as my CEF Insider members know, we do not want an index fund. Their paltry 1% yields are just plain unacceptable to us income investors.
Instead, we’re going with a closed-end fund (CEF) that invests in a broad range of S&P 500 stocks, but with a key difference: This one pays a rich 8% yield.
That would be the Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX), which holds tech darlings like Broadcom, as well as top performers from other sectors, like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM). Thanks to its well-crafted portfolio, ADX hasn’t just matched the stock market’s returns over the last decade—it’s beaten it.
This is why, at CEF Insider, we’ve been holding ADX for almost the entire time shown on this chart (and we would’ve held it for the entire time if CEF Insider had launched in 2015, rather than in 2017). This outperformance is great—but so is the dividend.
ADX has yielded around 9.5% over the last decade, thanks to the huge special payouts management issued at year-end. But in 2024, the fund changed its distribution plans, going with a more evenly spread payout tied to the fund’s net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio). Now, ADX’s regular distributions are more consistent and reliable.
The fund pays about 8% now, largely because the stock price is up over 13% in 2025 (as prices rise, yields fall). But its total return including dividends is 21.7% for the year, as of this writing, again far ahead of the S&P 500, at 16.6%.
In other words, this fund has outperformed over the short and the long term. Yet it still trades at a discount to NAV.
ADX’s discount is now 8.3%, but it was over 10% at the start of the year (and was around 12% most of the time before that). With the fund’s high yield, market outperformance and smartly built portfolio, this discount is likely to disappear, especially as more money comes into stocks as bubble fears fade.
If you buy ADX today, you can still lock in this discount, boosting your upside potential while also securing that healthy yield.

32,2025-10-31,"Black Friday is here early as the JBL Flip 7 hits just $109.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

With Black Friday comes a handful of Bluetooth speaker deals and other discounts, though Walmart is offering this next sale early. For a limited time, Walmart has cut $41 off the price of the JBL Flip 7 Bluetooth speaker, bringing it down to just $109.
The 7 is JBL's latest iteration of the Flip series, offering improvements to battery life and overall audio quality from previous generations. Arguably one of the largest benefits to the Flip is its size and shape, which is small and round enough to be portable, but large enough to boast a truly bass-forward sound that smaller speakers can't match. It stands at a little over 7 inches long and weighs about 3.21 pounds, while offering peak audio levels of 25W and up to 14 hours of battery life, according to JBL.
The unit charges using a USB-C port and features a water and dust resistance rating of IP68, making it perfectly suitable for most outdoor use cases. Beyond that, it also lets you access multi-band EQ settings using the JBL app, along with a durable design that's equally stylish. While this particular deal is available for the Blue and Red versions of the speaker, you can also get it in Black, Camo, Purple, or White for just a little bit more.
JBL Flip 7: $149.95 $106.72 at Walmart
Walmart is offering the JBL Flip 7 Bluetooth speaker for just $107 right now, marking $43 in savings from the normal purchase price. From its punchy, clear sound to the durable, yet portable build, the Flip series has been well-liked since its release, and this generation includes a handful of important improvements over the 6 and 5.
✅Recommended if: you're looking for a portable Bluetooth speaker that doesn't compromise audio quality; you want something that has water and dust resistance so it can be used for outdoor purposes like camping, hiking, and more; having a long battery life is highly important to you when it comes to buying a Bluetooth speaker.
❌Skip this deal if: you're looking for something even smaller or more portable like the company's Clip lineup; you'd prefer to go with a cheaper Bluetooth speaker, or you'd like to upgrade to one of the best Bluetooth speakers on the market and you have the extra budget to spend; you need something that has super fast charging capabilities.
The JBL Flip 7 is a solid Bluetooth speaker with a great shape, making it easy to get great audio quality on the go. The sound profile is both boomy, with added bass boost, and clear in the mid and high frequencies, making for an excellent portable sound that also boasts a long-lasting battery. JBL says you can get up to 16 hours of battery life with the Playback Boost setting, and for those who prefer to customize their audio, the JBL mobile app also features a multi-band EQ (though most devices now also include their own built-in EQ settings, if you prefer that).

    Commentary: Episode 2 takes an upsetting trip to the supermarket, and I'm still trying to figure out why it affected me so deeply.
  
Clara Stack stars in IT: Welcome to Derry.
IT: Welcome to Derry premiered its second episode on HBO Max today, two days earlier than scheduled, making your Halloween even sweeter. 
The prequel series, co-created by Andy and Barbara Muschietti (the duo behind 2017's It movie and 2019's sequel), takes audiences back to the Stephen King cinematic universe, where Pennywise, an extra-dimensional being that eventually takes the form of an evil clown, terrorizes the fictional town of Derry, Maine, every 27 years.
Episode 2, titled The Thing in the Dark, stays in 1962 and follows the small-town community as it deals with the shocking act of violence that wiped out a group of kids I thought were the show's main players.
The episode hones in on Lilly Bainbridge, the girl at the center of the story, and, unexpectedly, delivers one of the most unsettling scenes I've seen in a TV show this year.
It goes without saying that there are major story spoilers about the second episode of IT: Welcome to Derry below. If you've not watched it yet (HBO's cable channel won't air the episode until Sunday, Nov. 2), I suggest proceeding with caution. 
Thematically, IT: Welcome to Derry explores the corrosion of the American Dream -- the sinister underbelly lurking beneath its quaint Norman Rockwell veneer. The fantastic opening credit sequence makes that message clear, and it's on full display during a brief trip to the supermarket.
Lilly, like pretty much every child in Pennywise's orbit, is dealing with some semblance of trauma. Hers involves the death of her father, who died in a factory accident. It's 1962, and no one mentions seeking therapy. Instead, there are threats of shipping her off to Juniper Hill Asylum, which, if you're familiar with King's works, appears a lot in his literary universe.
From the moment she walks into the store, it's clear something is off. The further she wanders into the rows of canned goods and cereal boxes, it's obvious Pennywise is pulling the strings. Behind her, the aisles move, and quickly her trip to the market evolves into a nightmarish maze.
Clara Stack stars in IT: Welcome to Derry.
My Admiral Akbar brain told me it was a trap before the show did. As someone who once got lost in a supermarket, a terrifying childhood memory bubbled up and slapped me in the face.
There are two significant events that occur in this scene: First, the children who were murdered at the end of the first episode appear on boxes of cereal, and Pennywise's name is prominently displayed in big letters. Second, the evil entity appears in jars of pickles in the form of her dead dad. 
Let's go with the cereal thing first. 
Mascots first appeared on cereal boxes in the 1950s, and one that always stood out to me was Krinkles the Clown. He appeared on Post's Sugar Rice Krinkles. Like Bozo the Clown, this character proved popular with kids of that era. All you have to do is look at his face to see the resemblance to the dancing clown form Pennywise will eventually take.
For me, and so many from my generation, breakfast cereal is a portal to nostalgia. Memories of Saturday morning cartoons over bowls of Frosted Flakes are clear in my head. This was my safe space.
Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.
It feels like Pennywise is taking a page from Freddy Krueger's playbook. That blade-gloved nightmare first entered my world when I was still eating cereal in front of the TV, shattering that sense of safety I mentioned earlier. The supermarket scene in this episode of IT: Welcome to Derry captured that same unsettling vibe perfectly.
Like Krueger, IT takes pleasure in its victims' fear, and has wisecracks and one-liners to sprinkle atop the torture. Freddy was a notorious child killer, and as we've seen in Muschietti's updated take on Stephen King's classic, Pennywise's kid carnage is now more visceral, and no longer confined to off-camera moments.
All of the bad stuff in the series has happened in the dark, thus far. However, the horridness that befalls Lilly unfolds beneath the bright lights of the market, dismantling a place that normally represents safety and sustenance.  
Now, about those pickle jars. 
Lilly's father breaks from the glass, pieces himself into the shape of a slithering thing with tentacles and assaults the girl. It's brazen, disgusting and feels so (how should I put this?) 2025. 
She's left tearful on a floor full of shattered glass. Then, in the blink of an eye, it's not that at all. Everything goes back to normal, with a crowd of judgmental adults towering over the girl. Once again, Lilly's state of mind is called into question.
Through every iteration of Pennywise I've seen on screen, the ones that work the best take place in the past. IT: Welcome to Derry is an example of that, and somehow, the terrifying energy of our present-day real world is also there, lurking in the shadows. No one is safe in this city, and no punches are pulled on this show. All it takes is an innocent trip to the grocery store to nail that message home.
The rest of the season may be uneven in tone and pacing, but this scene is exactly the vibe I'd expect from any Pennywise story. Consider this five minutes very well spent."

Film photography is having a renaissance, but most point-and-shoots on the market are either vintage relics with unpredictable quirks or new models that miss the tactile magic of analog shooting entirely. For anyone who wants the joy of film with the reliability of modern tech, the search can feel endless and frustrating. Most cameras force you to choose between nostalgia and convenience, never delivering both at once.
The Analogue aF-1 camera bridges that gap by blending the best of both worlds into one compact package designed for modern film shooters. With classic looks, a fast 35mm f/2.8 lens, and digital features like LiDAR autofocus and automatic film handling, it’s a camera that makes every shot feel intentional and every moment easier to capture without the usual hassles. The aF-1 brings together decades of camera evolution successfully.
Designer: Analogue






The aF-1’s minimalist, matte-finished body is inspired by iconic compacts of the past like the Olympus Mju and Contax T series, but it’s newly manufactured with modern materials and a robust, splashproof build rated IPX4 for weather resistance. The 35mm f/2.8 lens with its 6-element Double Gauss optical design delivers sharp images and pleasing depth, while the Albada viewfinder and two-stage shutter make framing and focusing intuitive.







Its compact size and rounded edges make it easy to slip into a bag or pocket, ready for spontaneous street shots or travel adventures wherever creativity strikes unexpectedly. The splash resistance means light rain or coastal spray won’t stop you from shooting during outdoor adventures, and the robust build stands up to daily carry and occasional bumps without requiring excessive care or bulky protective cases.
The real magic is in how the camera mixes analog charm and digital reliability seamlessly throughout the shooting experience. LiDAR and Time-of-Flight sensors power fast, accurate autofocus from 0.5 meters to infinity, so you never miss a fleeting moment even in tricky light conditions where vintage cameras would struggle. The automatic film loader, advance, and rewind mean you can focus on shooting compositions, not fiddling with film mechanics.


The GN8 flash recycles in as little as half a second between shots, with physical toggles for Auto, Forced, Anti Red-eye, Nightmode, and Off modes, giving you full manual control in any lighting situation you encounter. The fast recycle time means you’re always ready for the next shot without waiting around impatiently, and the flash reaches up to three meters at ISO 100 for properly lit group shots.
The aF-1 uses standard 35mm film with DX-coded ISO support from 25 to 5000 and is powered by a widely available CR123A battery that’s easy to find anywhere in the world. The shutter speed ranges from 1/1000 to 4 seconds for creative flexibility across different lighting scenarios. A 10-second self-timer and focus/exposure lock add creative options for group shots or experimental long exposures during golden hour.

Shooting with the aF-1 is about slowing down and savoring each frame, but without the headaches of vintage gear that breaks or requires constant servicing and repair from specialists. The camera’s blend of analog feel and digital reliability makes film photography less intimidating and more rewarding for newcomers while giving experienced shooters the dependability they need for important moments worth preserving forever on physical film.

The budget laptop market has long been dominated by Chromebooks and entry-level Windows machines, but Apple may be about to crash the party. Reports indicate the tech giant is preparing to launch a $599 MacBook featuring the A18 Pro chip, offering desktop-class macOS performance at a price point that directly challenges competitors. If true, this could be Apple’s biggest strategic shift in the laptop space in over a decade.
The rumored device would mark a dramatic departure from Apple’s traditional pricing strategy, which has kept MacBooks firmly in premium territory. But with Chromebooks capturing the education market and budget Windows laptops satisfying casual users, Apple has watched from the sidelines as millions of potential customers chose competitors simply because the price of entry was too high. This move could change that calculus entirely.
Designer: Apple
The laptops could sport a colorful design, helping differentiate it from the more capable Air and Pro models.
The A18 Pro chip is the same processor that powers the iPhone 16 Pro, and Apple claims it delivers performance comparable to the M1 MacBook Air. That’s a legitimately capable chip for everyday computing tasks like web browsing, document editing, video streaming, and light photo work. You’re looking at a 12.9-inch display housed in what’s described as an ultra-thin, lightweight frame, with color options including silver, blue, pink, and yellow. The base model comes with 8GB of RAM, though there’s reportedly an option to upgrade to 16GB. It runs full macOS, which means you get access to the entire Apple ecosystem and software library, something Chromebooks fundamentally cannot offer.
But here’s where things get interesting, and where Apple’s compromises become obvious. No Thunderbolt ports. Limited external display support. That base 8GB of RAM is going to struggle with anything beyond basic multitasking. This machine is clearly designed for a specific user: students writing papers, casual users checking email and browsing the web, first-time Mac buyers who want to dip their toes into the ecosystem without dropping two grand. Apple isn’t trying to replace the MacBook Air or Pro with this device. They’re creating an entirely new category within their lineup, one that prioritizes accessibility over capability.

Spring 2026 puts this launch alongside the M5 MacBook Air, which will undoubtedly carry a higher price tag and more robust specs. Apple gets to segment their market cleanly: budget buyers get the A18 Pro MacBook, mainstream users get the M5 Air, and professionals stick with the Pro and Max configurations. Analysts are predicting this could boost MacBook shipments by up to 40 percent, which would be massive for a company that’s watched competitors dominate the sub-$700 laptop space for years.
There’s a real risk here that Apple cannibalizes their own iPad sales. Why would someone buy an iPad in the same price range when they could get a full laptop with macOS instead? The value proposition shifts dramatically when you’re comparing a tablet with accessories that cost more than this MacBook to an actual laptop with a keyboard included. Apple clearly thinks the trade-off is worth it, betting that bringing more people into the Mac ecosystem will pay dividends down the line when those users eventually upgrade to pricier models.

If you’re anything like me, you can’t watch anything horror-related without cracking wise to ease the tension while being genuinely unnerved by the terrors on display. That’s right, there are dozens of us annoying moviegoers (dozens!). And reading manga from folks like Junji Ito isn’t necessarily something you can do in one sitting on account of the relentlessly macabre body horror you can see through blinked eyelids in one ample sitting. So if you want to cozy up with a good manga this Halloween that’s less Zach Creggor Barbarian scary and more Weapons funny scaryâwith a hint of madcap Smiling Friends humor to ease the uneaseâDementia 21 is the perfect manga for you.
Dementia 21, created by Shintaro Kago, follows Yukie Sakai, a home health aide who prides herself on her services with the elderly. Yukie is all about making her clients smile; in turn, they reward her with top marks for her selfless, dedicated in-home living services, even if it puts her out in the process. In a short amount of time, all her hard work, verging dangerously close to toxic positivity, comes close to bearing fruit when she nearly cinches the rank of best live-in nurse at Green Net, a private elder care service company.
That is, until her co-worker gets a case of the evil eye and, after a tryst with their married boss, implores him to fudge the numbers to prevent Yukie from becoming a legend as the top scorer in the three months she’s had the job. While the boss can’t acquiesce to her request, he does move some things around to set Yukie up for failure by having all her clientele be senile old folks with supernatural powers.
It would be regressive to say that Dementia 21 is a more comedic vein of Ito-style horror. Kago’s absurdist, downright phantasmagoric work is simply too wild to be confined to such a blanket, generic point of comparison. From the first moment I cracked open the book, it was exceedingly apparent that Kago’s formative surrealist influences of Salvador Dali, Yasutaka Tsutsui’s black humor, and Akira creator Katsuhiro Otomo’s dense, detailed, and expressive art style were the creative cornerstones to the immediately arresting house of work he’s built for himself in Dementia 21.
The first volume is kind of a “kisou mangaka” (bizarre manga creator) and an “ero guro nansensu” (erotic grotesque) artist, blending sexuality, horror, and absurdity in a way that distorts reality through radical visuals and provocative themes, with laughs and gasps as the binding that holds its tales together. Does that mean she has to stop AI-powered dentures from creating a hivemind to take over the world or calm the political assassinations via pulley-delivered buckets in a series of sky-rise project nursing home visits? So be it.
To give you a taste of how all of the above emphatic gesturing plays out in the manga, I’ll regale you with some of my favorite misadventures of Yuki’s from its first volume.
An honorable mention to one of the tales in which Yukie is forced to drive with an elderly man who refuses to give up his license (been there). Thereâs no supernatural mumbo jumbo here, just absurdist humor out the wazoo. Yuki white-knuckles it as a passenger princess on a madcap highway adventure where her town has roads and laws that allow freeways for driving under the influence, heart attacks, toxic waste, and suicidesâall to Yuki’s absolute horror. Girlie just wants the patrol cop who keeps bothering them to get out of the lane if they don’t have any of those conditions and to pull them over. If not to revoke her geriatric road rage driver’s license, then at least to free her from this freeway nightmare.
But the first of my three favorite stories, in no particular order, starts with the ever-so-infectiously plucky and upbeat Yukie having to caretake a legally distinct geriatric Ultraman, using construction equipment to change his diapers and shovel gruel into a giant bowl. Things she manages well, all things considered, until his cosmic nemesis arrives one after another to challenge him in his old age. Their old-man loitering serves more as a nuisance to the townspeople, who ask her to find a way to move them right along without getting sidetracked, forgetting what they came for, and going off on non-sequiturs about nothing, wasting even more of everyoneâs time. It’s a banal, fashionable paranoia-type horror tale, but also funny and low-effort despite casually saying aliens also exist in this manga as a tone setter to the type of impossible tasks Yukie will have to undertake with a smile.
My second-favorite story sees Yukie endure a hellish nurse boot camp at the behest of her overbearing mother (who, of course, was once the best in-house nurse of all time). Disappointed that Yukie still hasnât won gold, she has her daughter black bagged and sent through the ringer at a rookie nurse bootcamp. After carrying mannequins through minefields and blistering blizzards, and under barbed wire fences (all without skimping on feeding and changing diapers), Yukie emerges as an elder care beast whose raison d’Ãªtre is house care. It gets so out of hand that she winds up being detained by the U.S. military to be deployed into enemy areas, giving them elder care to quell their need to fight, eliminating wars, and achieving world peace.
And my absolute favorite tale is one where Yukie has to take care of an old lady with dementia (just like the manga’s title!). While I, through Yukie, found the elderly lady’s family a bit annoyingly eccentric, doing too much to make sure she remembered them as her favorite grandchildren, it became apparent why they were being so irritating. The catch is that a world-ending supernatural gift also touches the old lady: if she forgets anythingâbe it a person or a conceptâthey’ll explode into a mist of viscera, which she does almost immediately upon meeting Yukie. “Who are you again?” Grandkids explode. “That’s a cute dog. Whose is it?” Pup popped. Her dementia powers get even more hyperspecific with what they destroy, removing the concept of toupees, “fake tits,” and “virgin,” and having folks combust like spent firecrackers.
It’s all a delightfully shocking misadventure that doesn’t necessarily get solved but worked around, thanks to Yukie digging in deep and giving it 110 percent, helping administer an anti-dementia drug that’s fast-tracked into her client like a dagger, bringing all the forgotten concepts and people back, but in a messed-up homunculus stitched together.
Speaking anecdotally, one aspect that makes discovering Dementia 21 such a breath of fresh air as someone whose whole deal is covering manga and anime and has gotten a touch tired of just thinking about shonen or gross-out horror is that I happened upon the manga by pure chance by checking out a local brick-and-mortar bookstore. No futzing with manga reading apps‘ payment services that feel increasingly like live service gatcha games nickel and diming users, limiting how many chapters they can get in a day before coughing up more dough to “rent” them for a limited time. Just old-school commerce for cheap (since this particular second-hand donation-based bookstore sold it for $13 against its market price of $30).
So if you’re more of the comedy-horror pastiche-indulging manga reader, be sure to check out Dementia 21 and have nosy passersby on the bus rubberneck over your shoulder at the wild bits of horror and slapstick comedy beaming out of its pages like I’ve been delighting in doing since picking it up.

Oracle stock (NYSE: ORCL) has dropped 7% in a day, currently priced at $257. This decline appears to be due to profit-taking after the stock had soared over 80% in the past six months, largely driven by the announcement of its five-year, $300 billion cloud computing contract with OpenAI.
Despite the dramatic single-day drop, Oracle's overall operational and financial performance remains strong. However, the key concern is the current valuation. Our comprehensive evaluation suggests the stock is Relatively Expensive due to this Very High valuation, potentially making a target price of $183 achievable. Given this valuation risk, we believe now might be the right moment to decrease holdings in ORCL stock.
Here is our evaluation:
Smart investing isn’t about forecasting; it’s about allocation. Observe how Trefis’ Boston-based wealth management partner approaches this. It has included High Quality Portfolio in its asset allocation strategy.
Let’s dive into details of each of the assessed factors, but beforehand, a quick background: With $726 Bil in market capitalization, Oracle offers cloud software applications, industry-specific solutions, application licenses, licensing support services, enterprise databases, software development instruments, and middleware.
This table shows how ORCL is valued compared to the broader market. For further details, see: ORCL Valuation Ratios
This table illustrates how ORCL's growth compares to the broader market. For additional details, see: ORCL Revenue Comparison
This table illustrates how ORCL's profitability compares to the broader market. For further details, see: ORCL Operating Income Comparison
ORCL has shown greater resilience than the S&P 500 index during different economic downturns. We evaluate this through both (a) the extent of the stock's drop and (b) the speed of its recovery.
Remember, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics."

Southern Copper (SCCO)’s stock skyrocketed by 57%, year-to-date, propelled not only by increased revenue and margin improvements but also by a rising P/E multiple that indicates renewed investor confidence. The reasons behind this surge include soaring copper prices, milestones achieved at Tia Maria, impressive earnings, and strategic cost and by-product initiatives—all hinting at a more complex narrative.
 
What’s unfolding here? The stock rose by 57%, driven by a 9.2% increase in revenue, an 8.4% improvement in net margin, and a robust 32% increase in the P/E multiple. Let’s explore the factors that contributed to these changes.
Before delving into the details of events that resulted in the stock increase, consider this insight from market wisdom: SCCO stock may be volatile, while a balanced allocation is not. Trefis’ Boston-based wealth management partner combines strategy and discipline to mitigate market fluctuations.
Reasons Behind the Movement of Southern Copper Stock
Our Current Assessment of SCCO Stock
Opinion: Presently, we consider SCCO stock to be fairly valued. Why is that? Explore the full narrative. Read Buy or Sell SCCO Stock to understand the factors influencing our current viewpoint.
Risk: A prudent way to assess risk for SCCO is to review its most significant declines during previous market distress periods. It experienced a nearly 79% drop during the Global Financial Crisis, 48% in the 2018 correction, approximately 46% during the Covid crash, and 43% during the inflation shock. Even in less severe downturns, the stock endured substantial losses. This indicates that despite strong fundamentals, SCCO is not immune to market downturns.
Consistently picking winners is challenging—particularly considering the volatility linked to a single stock. Instead, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a proven history of outperforming the S&P 500 comfortably over the past four years. What accounts for this success? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster experience, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Samsung Android Apple iOS Xiaomi vivo

A new report by Omdia is out today and it crowns Samsung as the winner of the smartphone sales game in the third quarter (July to September). The Korean company shipped 60.6 million devices for a 19% market share, growing 6% over Q3 2024.
Apple is second with 56.5 million shipments and 18% of the pie, growing 4% from the year-ago quarter. Xiaomi is in third with 43.4 million shipments, 14% market share, and a 1% growth year-on-year (YoY). Transsion (owner of Infinix, iTel, and Tecno) is in fourth with 28.6 million shipments, 9% market share, and the biggest YoY growth of the top five at 12%. vivo is fifth with 28.5 million shipments and 9% market share, having grown 5% from Q3 2024's numbers.
Samsung's growth was driven by the Galaxy Z Fold7 and Flip7, as well as the A07 and A17. Apple's base iPhone 17 ""outperformed launch expectations due to improved value proposition"". Xiaomi shipments in China declined after state subsidy programs ended, but growth in Asia-Pacific and other regions offset that. vivo remained strong in India, overtook Huawei in China, and kept growing across Asia-Pacific, Africa, and Latin America.
The entire market shipped 320.1 million units in Q3, a 3% increase year-on-year. Shipments in North America and Greater China declined YoY, while Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, and Africa recorded strong growth. In Africa, shipments grew by 25%, and Asia-Pacific grew 5%.
Interestingly, Omdia says the overall growth is driven by under $100 and above $700 devices, while the mid-range remains weak. In the near future, higher prices are expected for new devices, and this will hinder the growth of the low-end segment.

    Which ingredients are needed for a game to go viral on Twitch? At TwitchCon 2025, developers dished out details.
  
Games that go viral on Twitch focus on community. 
Sometimes it's easy to forget that Twitch got its start as a gaming-focused offshoot of Justin.TV. While games are still prominently showcased on the front page, it's the ""just chatting"" category that tends to dominate.
It could be why there was a limited selection of developers showcasing their games, compared to the many companies showcasing streaming hardware and technology at TwitchCon 2025. 
However, Twitch is still a video game streaming site at heart, and going viral on the platform can mean substantial riches for game makers.
Of the handful of developers present at the semi-annual Twitch convention in San Diego earlier in October, many were focused on communal experiences. It makes sense, given that in 2025, titles like Peak and Baby Steps, which intentionally use awkward controls for over-the-top reactions, dominated the platform.
It's impossible to predict which game might go viral on Twitch, but there are some trends among the successes to look out for. 
The venerable online shooter Fortnite is seen as a Twitch darling, remaining a top title eight years after release. Before it took over Twitch, Fortnite was a base-building game with crafting mechanics when it launched in 2017. Its developer, Epic Games, quickly released a new mode with a battle royale gimmick, similar to PUBG's popular model. It pits one player against 99 others, all vying to be the last one standing. That quick reaction to trends helped Fortnite succeed. 
Among Us, Minecraft and Escape from Tarkov are other examples of games that started off with one concept, only for the community to influence the design.
Of course, the underlying gameplay of all these hits had to be rewarding and enjoyable, but they also allowed for viral moments where players ""popped off"" with clutch plays, claiming victory from the jaws of defeat.
Speaking to me on the show floor of the massive, but sparsely attended, San Diego Convention Center, Virgil Watkins, design lead at Embark Studios -- makers of the upcoming extraction shooter ARC Raiders -- said that viral Twitch games need to have simple starting concepts.
""I think they incorporate a very simple game loop that you can pick up and play and understand very, very quickly, and then kind of discover the depths together,"" Watkins said. ""The biggest factor is the fact that you generate a lot of really funny stories.""
Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.
Among Us is a social deduction game where players have to identify imposters before they kill their crewmates on a virtual spaceship.
Video gaming is a big business. It's the largest entertainment medium, surpassing the movie and music industries combined, according to a 2024 report by Japanese advertising agency Dentsu. 
The global video game market is currently valued at $299 billion and is projected to reach $600 billion by 2030, according to Grand View Research. This includes casual online games, mobile games and big-budget console and PC titles. The allure of video game revenues has streaming services jumping in on the action, with both Netflix and Crunchyroll offering game downloads to subscribers. 
At the same time, the video game market is quickly becoming saturated. According to data from SteamDB, approximately 40 to 50 games are released daily on the online PC marketplace Steam, as reported by Kotaku. With the sheer glut of games being released on PC alone, critics, tastemakers and online streamers can help steer audiences toward what's worth playing. 
And if a game does take off on Twitch, it can mean wild riches for developers. 
When Among Us saw a flash of viral success on Twitch during the COVID-19 pandemic, it propelled the game to stratospheric commercial heights. While developer Innersloth hasn't released the exact numbers, based on sales data comparing mobile and PC platforms, it's estimated that the game has generated $105 million in revenue since its launch. That's excluding merchandising and other IP partnerships. It's a tremendous amount of money for the four-person development team at Innersloth, although the team has grown since.
What made Among Us work was its simple premise (a round-based murder mystery in space), its communal focus, and the silly visuals of cartoony blobs committing murder. It attracted gamers of all ages and led to never-ending scrolls of viral clips online. 
The developers I spoke to at TwitchCon all said they aren't intentionally trying to make a viral game for the online livestreaming platform, but they acknowledged they're taking cues from past successes. They aren't trying to copy the look and gameplay of prior hits. Instead, they want to replicate the thrilling novelty of viral moments that those games generated.
""I think discovery moments are an important feature, and what I mean by that is, if you always know what you expect to see, it's like watching a TV show for the third time,"" said Mac Reynolds, CEO and co-founder of Night Street Games, which is developing the title Last Flag. Reynolds is also the manager for the pop-rock band Imagine Dragons, in which his brother is the vocalist. 
Reynolds wants Last Flag to be filled with cool moments that dazzle player imaginations and force creative gameplay solutions in the heat of battle.
Generally speaking, for a game to take off on Twitch, experiences must be short, feature a level of randomness for a degree of surprise and have a lot of replayability. Esports titles like League of Legends or Overwatch 2 lend themselves well to Twitch success. Both are highly competitive games in which skilled teams can make fist-biting upsets.
""For me, the unexpectedness of the live experience is what makes it magical,"" Reynolds said.
TwitchCon 2025 booth for the game Task Time.
Releasing games in early access also helps. It's a way for developers to release incomplete games for audiences to test and invest in as they become more feature-complete. 
The ghost-hunting horror game Phasmophobia was released in early access in 2020 by studio Kinetic Games, yet it still doesn't have an official ship date. Despite its eerie veneer, which could suggest a more niche appeal, it has already reached 25 million total sales.
""The community kind of expects us to make all these massive changes,"" said Daniel Knight, managing director and lead developer at Kinetic Games. ""So we've completely changed the progression system over the early access. We've added so much, like more equipment, more maps, ghosts.""
While Phasmophobia isn't positioning itself as a ""live service"" game (where there's a steady stream of content and players are incentivized to continue returning to maximize their rewards), the team does have a roadmap to show players how the game will ultimately progress. 
""Because of early access, we're allowed to make these massive changes,"" Knight said.
Early access also dovetails into building a community during the development process, which helped games like Hades and Hades II establish a wide player base before their official release. It's these folks jumping in at the ground level that will likely champion the game upon release. 
For developers, maintaining a direct line of communication with their community is crucial, as it can help spread positive vibes and build momentum for the game online. 
The team over at Wired Productions knows this all too well. The developers are currently making the multiplayer party game Task Time, with veterans from studios Boneloaf and Mediatonic, the creators of Gang Beasts and Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout, respectively. Fall Guys, in particular, became a massive hit during the pandemic, selling 11 million copies within the first few months of its release and featuring prominently in Twitch streams for a time.
""We've already got a player base invested and they know who we are with, they know what the game is, and we know that we're listening to their ongoing thoughts,"" said Sam Clay, communications manager at Wired Productions. 
It's that dialogue that facilitates a deeper connection between player and developer. ""Everyone's invested -- the players become a part of the development as well,"" Clay said.
Another element helping games take off on Twitch is Integrations. This feature allows viewers to influence the game that streamers are playing through chat, giving the audience a say in their entertainment. There's an ever-growing list of these integrated games on Twitch. Task Time will be another title to look out for when it releases next year.
An upcoming title by Austin-based developer Sentinel Games, called Cure -- A Hospital Simulator, has some unique Twitch integrations. In the chat, you can become patients, turn into zombies and have certain actions with streamers, like subscriptions, follows and raids, appear in-game. It'll launch on Steam Early Access in November. 
Whether it be one-versus-99 games of tag, whodunnit-style bouts of Mafia or identifying specters in 20-minute increments, all games that have gone viral on Twitch include one thing: the unexpected. 
Each hit game brings something new to the table, remixing familiar elements to give players a novel experience -- and, more importantly, one they're not seeing alone.
Streamers and viewers want to experience uniquely fun moments together and be able to clip and share them with the rest of the internet. 
It's not too dissimilar from other forms of live entertainment, albeit instead of packing thousands of people into an auditorium, everyone's participating from their homes. 
Reynolds, who has attended his fair share of concerts over the years managing his brother's band, knows the power of communal entertainment all too well. 
""It's the magic of live music, it's the magic of livestreaming, the reason people go to concerts. The reason people follow something on Twitch is because it's happening right then, and you never know what that next moment's gonna be."""

Laptops that are specifically designed with gamers and creatives in mind usually donât come cheap. While the exact price depends on the configuration, most of the powerful options out there with solid graphics easily cross the $1,000 mark. Thankfully, that changes today.
Amazon has slashed the price of the latest 16-inch HP Elitebook (AMD Ryzen 5, 32GB DDR5 RAM and 1TB PCIe SSD) down to $859, after an unbelievable $1,540 discount on the retail price of $2,399. This is the lowest we have seen this machine drop to in a long while, and we donât expect the offer to be around for long. Itâs best to grab yours before itâs too late. Thereâs no telling if this discount will return for Black Friday or if the stock will even last that long.

Like most HP laptops, this machine comes in a sleek, lightweight build with a premium finish.

For power, youâre getting a 6-core AMD Ryzen 5 processor that can clock up to 4.9GHz; perfect for heavier workloads. Even better, itâs backed by 32GB of DDR5 RAM for some impressive multitasking, plus a 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD that offers much faster boot times than traditional drives. 1TB is also enough space to store all your essentials, from media content to work documents and games.
Connectivity-wise, it comes with Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 for wireless connections, plus a full selection of ports including HDMI 2.1, Ethernet, two USB-A ports, and two Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports.

Although Oracle experienced a decline of -6.7% in the past day, its counterpart Adobe might be a more favorable option. Regularly assessing alternatives is fundamental to a solid investment strategy.
The recent decline in Oracle stock comes amid concerns over growth and rising costs, as well as insider selling of the stock. While Adobe (ADBE) stock too has seen some volatility, it provides superior revenue growth during critical periods, enhanced profitability, and a comparatively lower valuation in relation to Oracle (ORCL) stock, indicating that investing in ADBE may be advantageous.
Investing in a single stock can be risky, but there is significant benefit in a wider, diversified approach that we adopt with the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. We extend our analysis beyond merely equities. Would a portfolio consisting of 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% cryptocurrency, in addition to equities and bonds, likely yield higher returns over the next 1-3 years and offer better protection in the event of a 20% market crash? We have analyzed the figures. 
ORCL delivers cloud software services, industry solutions, application licenses, license support, enterprise databases, software development languages, and middleware products. ADBE is a global software company that offers Creative Cloud subscription services and products in Digital Media, Experience, Publishing, and Advertising, catering to enterprise clients through direct sales and local offices.

Thereâs no shortage of laptops on the market, but finding one that can handle everyday work and entertainment without unnecessary extras or a high price tag can be tough. HP makes some of our favorite options out there, and Amazon is making it easy to treat yourself to one right now.
We just spotted the 17.3-inch HP flagship laptop going for $699, thanks to a massive 73% off its original retail price of $2,599. Thatâs over $1,800 in savings, and one of the steepest drops weâve seen on a full-size laptop packed with massive RAM (32GB) and storage (1TB). This is a limited-time offer, and while it hasnât been marked as a lightning deal, thereâs no guarantee itâll last through the week-end.

Salesforce (CRM) stock deserves a spot on your radar. Here is why – it is presently operating within the support range ($243.82 – $269.48), prices from which it has made substantial recoveries in the past. 
Over the last 10 years, Salesforce stock attracted buying attention at this level on 6 occasions and subsequently achieved an average peak return of 23.4%.
However, is the price movement sufficient on its own? It certainly bolsters the case if the underlying fundamentals align. For CRM Read Buy or Sell CRM Stock to evaluate how compelling this purchasing opportunity may be.

Following Amazon’s exceptional Q3 2025 earnings disclosed on October 30th, which saw the stock rise 12% in after-hours trading, the crucial question is: Is this the start of a significant surge that could elevate AMZN stock to $500 or more? It's certainly a possibility.
Amazon announced earnings per share of $1.95, exceeding the expected $1.57—a 25% surprise that caught Wall Street completely off guard. Revenue reached $180.2 billion, a 13% increase year-over-year, surpassing the $177.8 billion consensus forecast.
But here’s the real highlight: AWS revenue skyrocketed 20% to $33 billion, representing the strongest growth since 2022 and outpacing analyst predictions of $32.4 billion. This isn’t just about exceeding expectations—it’s about AWS demonstrating that it can compete with Microsoft Azure’s 40% growth and Google Cloud’s 34% growth in the AI era.
Why is this significant for the stock price? Because it directly tackles the primary issue hindering Amazon’s valuation. Before the earnings release, AMZN had only increased by 2.2% year-to-date while the S&P 500 gained 16%. Investors were concerned that Amazon was falling behind in the AI competition. These results show a different story.
In the following sections, we will explore how AMZN stock could potentially double from this point. However, if you’re looking for upside with less volatility than holding individual stocks like AMZN, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns over 105% since its inception. Why is this the case? In general, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; there’s less volatility, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
How is Amazon's AI strategy structured? Unlike competitors who rely on partnerships, Amazon is developing its own infrastructure empire. The company has just launched Project Rainier—an $11 billion AI data center in Indiana equipped with more than 500,000 Trainium 2 chips specifically intended for training Anthropic’s Claude models.
What differentiates this from Microsoft or Google’s strategies? Amazon is not just hosting AI—it is also manufacturing the hardware. AWS CEO Matt Garman indicated that the company spent nearly $100 billion in capital expenditures in the past 12 months. This vertical integration grants Amazon pricing power and margin growth that competitors find difficult to match.
Can AWS maintain growth of 20% or more? The evidence suggests it can. Demand for AI computing from enterprises is escalating more quickly than supply. Amazon has increased its data center capacity by 3.8 gigawatts in a year—more than any other cloud provider. With Anthropic set to utilize 1 million Amazon chips by the end of 2025, AWS has secured significant revenue predictability.
What is fueling Amazon's advertising growth? The figures present a compelling narrative. Ad revenue reached $17.7 billion in Q3 2025, reflecting a 22% year-over-year increase, building on the $56.2 billion annual run rate established in 2024. Amazon's distinctive role as both a retailer and a media platform offers unrivaled targeting capabilities that command premium pricing.
How does this stack up against other high-growth sectors? While AWS receives much of the attention, advertising serves as Amazon’s hidden growth driver. The introduction of ads on Prime Video broadened inventory while retaining the valuable e-commerce data that boosts the effectiveness of Amazon's ads. This dual revenue stream strategy resembles successful technology giants like Google. For more, see – Amazon’s segment financials.
And what about the main retail segment? Don't underestimate the foundation. Amazon's online store generated $247 billion in 2024, and $67.4 billion in Q3 2025, accounting for 37% of total revenue. This segment isn't declining—its consistent cash flow is fueling the high-margin AWS and advertising growth that elevates valuation metrics.
What needs to occur for Amazon to reach $500? Let’s analyze the scenarios. At the current price around $251 (post-earnings), Amazon is trading at approximately 35x trailing earnings. For the stock to double, we need either earnings growth, multiple expansion, or a combination of both.
Can earnings double within 2-3 years? The trajectory indicates it is plausible. With AWS growing at over 20% alongside improving margins, advertising revenue potentially approaching $90-100 billion, and AI efficiencies enhancing operations, there is a pathway to over $11 per share in earnings—double the 2024 figures.
Will the market accept premium multiples? This is where it becomes intriguing. If Amazon maintains its current 35x multiple on $11 earnings, that alone would elevate the stock to $385. However, companies driven by AI growth often command multiples of 40-50x. Applying a 45x multiple to $11 earnings would suggest a valuation of $495.
What about the revenue growth narrative? Amazon’s guidance for Q4 2025 of $206-213 billion in revenue indicates that the company is on track for $900 billion in annual revenue within three years. This level of scale, combined with margin expansion due to AI investments, underpins premium valuations.
Consider that investing in a single stock without thorough analysis can be risky. Explore the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has exceeded its all-cap stock benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to deliver robust returns for investors. Why is this? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks presented an adaptable approach to capitalize on favorable market conditions while minimizing losses when markets decline, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.
Amazon’s Q3 2025 earnings signify a potential turning point. The combination of accelerating AWS growth, booming advertising revenue, and substantial AI infrastructure investments creates multiple avenues for significant stock appreciation.
The calculations supporting a rise to over $500 aren’t speculative—they're based on sound business fundamentals. With AWS sustaining over 20% growth, advertising potentially reaching $100 billion, and AI fostering margin expansion across all sectors, Amazon possesses the revenue growth and profitability trajectory to justify premium valuations.
The primary catalyst is investor recognition that Amazon isn’t falling behind in the AI race—it’s constructing the infrastructure necessary to lead it. Project Rainier and the Trainium chip initiative provide distinctive advantages that competitors cannot easily replicate. For investors with a 2-3 year horizon, valuations in the range of $400-500 seem achievable."
51,2025-10-31,"Apple reported record earnings for the September 2025 period on Thursday, announcing it generated $102.5 billion in revenue, of which iPhone sales accounted for $49 billion. The iPhone 17 started selling on September 12 when online preorders went live. While the iPhone 17 accounted only for a portion of iPhone sales during the September quarter, the 2025 iPhone series will likely dominate the December quarter. In remarks to CNBC, Apple CEO Tim Cook said Apple expects revenue to grow by 10% to 12% in December compared to the December 2024 quarter. ""We expect iPhone revenue to grow double digits, year over year, and we expect that that would make the December quarter the best ever in the history of the company,"" Cook said, adding that demand for the iPhone 17 has been ""off the charts.""
The iPhone 17 models have been sold out online from the first day of preorders, and supply has remained constrained around the world since then. Cook even said as much to CNBC. BGR has been tracking the delivery estimates for all four new iPhones in several key Apple markets around the world since launch, relaying the shipping delays Apple's local online stores provide every Friday. As of the morning of October 31, some iPhone 17 models remain sold out online, showing delivery delays from several days to weeks, depending on the model and market.
Apple has caught up with demand in some markets, at least temporarily. Also, the base iPhone 17 model remains as highly coveted as the higher-priced iPhone 17 Pro Max in some markets.
On Friday, we looked at every storage and color combination for all four new iPhones in nine markets, including the U.S., Canada, U.K., France, Switzerland, Germany, Ireland, China, and Japan. The iPhone Air is in stock in all nine markets. The iPhone 17 Pro Max and the iPhone 17 have the biggest shipping delays, at 2-3 weeks each for the U.S. and Canada. Interestingly, the iPhone 17 Pro will ship within a week in both markets.
The European markets and China have seen the biggest stock improvements. All four new iPhones are available for online purchase in Switzerland, Germany, and Ireland. France has also seen improvements for the iPhone 17 Pro models compared to last week. Similarly, China saw major delivery improvements. All models are in stock, including the iPhone Air, which was sold out before. On the other hand, all three iPhone 17 models are now sold out online in Japan, a notable development since last Friday when the four iPhones had no shipping delays.
Our checks show that iPhone 17 demand is still high and stock can fluctuate from one week to the next. Apple seems to have caught up with demand in some markets, but things can change in a matter of days, as was the case with Japan this week."

What this means: On a weekly basis, Realtor.com reports the year-over-year change in active inventory, new listings and median prices.  On a monthly basis, they report total inventory.  For October, Realtor.com reported active inventory was up 15.3% YoY, but still down 13.2% compared to the 2017 to 2019 same month levels. 
Here is their weekly report: Weekly Housing Trends: Latest Data as of Oct. 25• AActive inventory climbed 14.6% year over year

The number of homes active on the market climbed 14.6% year-over-year, marking the 103th consecutive week of annual gains in inventory. There were about 1.1 million homes for sale last week, marking the 26th week in a row over the million-listing threshold. Active inventory is growing significantly faster than new listings, an indication that more homes are sitting on the market for longer, and homeowners aren’t eager to sell.
  
• New listings—a measure of sellers putting homes up for sale—up 5.9% year over year

New listings were up 5.9% last week compared with the same period a year ago, extending the streak of accelerating growth to three weeks.
  
• The median listing price was flat year over year

The median list price remained flat compared to the same week one year ago. Adjusting for home size, the price per square foot fell 0.8% year over year, dropping for the eighth consecutive week. The price per square foot grew steadily for almost two years, but the weak sales activity has finally caught up and shaken underlying home values despite stable prices.

Since we began tracking U.S. sectors, the Health Care sector has very often been one of the top performing on a long-term basis. Even through one- to two-year periods of underperformance, it has maintained its long-term edge. In addition, it has a strong history during market downtrends and has often led during positive market environments. On a net basis, since 1970, it is the second-leading sector behind Retail. The two have battled for the top spot for much of the last 25 years after emerging into the lead in the 1980s and 1990s. The reason for this enduring strength is that Health Care is both a staple industry that all consumers rely on and an innovation-driven sector led by advances in pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, genomics, and medical devices.
However, the past three years have seen historic underperformance for the sector. Since close to when the new bull market began (late October 2022), Health Care has lagged the S&P 500 by as much as 70% over a trailing three-year period (as of the week ended September 26). This surpassed its prior worst three-year period of -51%, which ended in December 1977. Several factors explain this underperformance. First, fears about changing government regulation have loomed over the industry, as both U.S. political parties are concerned with Health Care inflation and are actively seeking ways to lower costs. This has resulted in pricing pressure for pharmaceuticals, as well as lower Medicare and Medicaid rates for many medical services. Next, Health Care growth—slightly positive but below its historical trend—has been overshadowed by the growth in the technology sector driven by spending in AI. Finally, Health Care companies have also experienced cost pressures as labor rates and other expenses have risen, squeezing margins.
On a trailing one-year basis, the relative sector performance also matched all-time lows, reaching -32% for the week ended August 8. This has eased to about -18% currently, but even at that level, is within the worst 5% of all weeks since 1970. This level of underperformance has caught our attention. While many of the pressures that have hurt stock price performance remain, the magnitude of the underperformance suggests that sector stocks may be discounting an overly pessimistic future. Health Care will remain a key sector of the U.S. economy and one that will reward innovation. We’re constructive on services related to smaller biotechs, genetic testing, and select medical devices.
The O’Neil Health Care sector (market-cap weighted across all stocks) has made an interesting turn over the past four weeks. On a weekly chart, it has broken a downtrend which had been in place for the past year. This has led to a golden cross with the 10-WMA moving back above the 40-WMA. It has also made a series of higher lows, which is a constructive technical signal, and is just 4% off all-time highs after the recent recovery, despite its relative underperformance.
At the subgroup level there are several key groups to monitor. Currently, some groups appear to support a reversion trade in the near term, while other groups remain weak. We suspect that investors’ bearish worst fears will not be realized. If the economy slows, which may be indicated by slower consumer spending and a cooling job market, Health Care’s growth may look more attractive on a relative basis. Also, its relatively stable revenues should appeal to investors as other sectors slow or shrink. As a result, we think investors should consider increasing their exposure to the sector to around equal weight, especially given that many are currently underweight. Still, the sector has more to prove before it moves into a leadership position.
Because the sector is not a long-term leader at this point, we think it is best to pick spots wisely from within the space. Here are the few dozen Health Care names (with more than $3 billion market cap) that have already reported Q3 results. Although the overall average reaction is positive, it is still very mixed, with slightly over half declining post-results. Net positives have been Biotech (+2% on average), Ethical Drugs (+2%), Hospitals (+3%), Home Care (+2%), Products (+5%), Services (+3%), and Systems/Equipment (+5%), and the one stock in Distribution (+20%). This is offset by the net negatives in Managed Care (-5%), Research Equipment (-5%), and the one stock in Generics (-9%). We would add that while Research Equipment as a whole has reacted down, the area we are most positive on is contract research organizations catering to small- to mid-sized biotech companies (see MEDP).
Across our U.S. Focus List of top picks, in October we moved from just one stock (PODD) and a less than 2% weighting to five stocks and a 9% weighting. This is roughly in line with the S&P 500, which we think makes sense at this stage. Three stocks were added post-results and are still actionable or buyable in our view. One from each of the spaces we like most currently includes Biotech (INCY), Systems and Equipment (ISRG), and Genomic Testing Services (WGS).

Key Takeaways
-Tech gets a confidence boost
-Some sector rotation is happening
-Market still digesting Fed meeting
 
  Amazon.com and Apple are going to kick us off in a big way today as the market continues to drive higher.  It is very encouraging to see two of the stalwarts of the market be the further drivers of the rally.  In fact, Amazon.com crushed earnings as the closely watch AWS end of the company beat and helped round out a very solid earnings report.  In the case of Apple, they beat on iPhone sales and gives great confidence to  the overall market, but to the tech sector in particular. We will talk about earnings more in a bit. 
Let’s take a look at what happened in yesterday’s session.  We saw the market stumble a bit yesterday as the tech stocks gave a much cloudier picture. Yesterday was a tale of two cities as Alphabet had a 2.5% gain on the day with a strong quarterly report.  Much of this was driven by advertising and cloud businesses.  These were two very widely followed areas by analysts and they certainly were happy with what they saw.  When you put up $100 Billion in Quarterly Earnings that sends a large message.  META Platforms, however, were the other end of the spectrum. The stock was down over 11% on the day. This was primarily due to concern over expenses rising faster than expected and a one-time tax charge of $16 Billion. One other stock that stumbled of note yesterday was Chipotle Mexican Grill which was down 18,2%, making it the biggest loser in the S&P 500.  The company reported a struggle with the 25–34-year-old cohort of customers (worth watching) and with that missed on the Quarter and lowered yearly outlook
As we head to todays Halloween trading action, as mentioned Apple and Amazon have us off to a great start on the day.  Some of the other earnings we wanted to mention are from the Energy Sector. Exxon Mobil Corporation reported earnings that slightly missed expectations and continued the lower year-over-year trend. Much of that is due to the lower price of Crude Oil and the stock is down slightly.  Chevron Corporation is mostly unchanged as the earnings also fell year over year, but they did top estimates
The other things to watch all revolve around the rotating of Investor expectations.  That is one of the things that many have pointed out is a seeming rotation by some of the large firms from an incredibly strong weighted tech sector to the Financial and Pharmaceutical sectors.   We also have a seeming “trade truce” between the US and China. We know that this is a fragile partnership and one that has the investing community nervous.  The last one to keep in mind is the constantly changing probabilities of a December rate cut after the Fed comments on Wednesday. This will be a constant subject for us to visit over the next few weeks as Investors try to digest what this means.
As always stay with your long-term Investment goals and stick with your trading plan
Have a Happy and Safe Halloween!"

Chipotle Mexican Grill stock (NYSE: CMG) crashed 18% yesterday, October 30, 2025, after the company reported its Q3 2025 earnings.
For the third time this year, Chipotle cut its sales forecast due to weaker-than-expected comparable sales. Management attributed this disappointing performance to persistent macroeconomic pressures and a notable pullback in spending from its core customers, particularly the 25-to-35 age group.
This single-day drop has extended CMG’s recent decline to 23.2% in under a month (falling from $42.36 on 10/21/2025 to a current price of $32.53). Given this sharp correction, the central question for investors is: Should you buy this dip? Buying a stock after a decline is a valid strategy, provided the company is a quality business with a history of bouncing back.
It turns out that CMG stock meets basic quality criteria, having generated a median return of 94% over one year, and a peak return of 102% after experiencing sharp declines (>30% in 30 days) historically. For a brief overview, CMG offers fast-casual Mexican food with around 3,000 locations in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and other parts of Europe since 1993.

That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like CMG, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
CMG has experienced 2 occurrences since 1/1/2010 when the dip threshold of -30% within 30 days was breached
It is essential to assess revenue growth, profitability, cash flow, and the strength of the balance sheet to mitigate the risk that a dip may signal a deteriorating business situation.
Investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics."

Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ:PLTR) is scheduled to announce its earnings on Monday, November 3, 2025. Growth is expected to be underpinned by accelerating adoption of its AI platform, rising enterprise demand, and deeper commercial partnerships that are broadening the company’s industry footprint. Continued strength in government contracts is also likely to drive performance.
The firm currently has a market capitalization of $460 billion. Over the past twelve months, revenue was $3.4 billion, and the company reported operational profit with $570 million in operating profits and a net income of $763 million. While how the stock reacts after the earnings report will depend on how the results and future outlook compare to investor expectations, analyzing past results can be beneficial if you are a trader focused on events.
This can be done in two ways: either comprehend the historical probabilities and prepare yourself ahead of the earnings announcement, or assess the relationship between immediate and medium-term returns following earnings and make an investment one day after the announcement.

Investing in a single stock can be risky, but adopting a wider, diversified strategy as we do with the Trefis High Quality Portfolio provides significant value. Additionally, think about what the long-term performance of your portfolio could be if you allocated 10% to commodities, 10% to gold, and 2% to crypto alongside equities.
Palantir Technologies' Historical Chances of Positive Post-Earnings Return
Here are some insights into one-day (1D) returns following earnings:
More data about the observed 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns post earnings is summarized along with the statistics in the table below.
 
Relationship Between 1D, 5D, and 21D Historical Returns
A relatively less risky approach (though ineffective if the correlation is weak) is to understand the relationship between short-term and medium-term returns after earnings, identify a pair with the strongest correlation, and execute the appropriate trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D exhibit the highest correlation, a trader could position themselves “long” for the next 5 days following a positive 1D post-earnings return. Below is some correlation data based on a 5-year and a 3-year (more recent) history. Please note that the correlation 1D_5D refers to the link between 1D post-earnings returns and the following 5D returns.
If you’re looking for potential upside with a smoother experience than investing in a single stock like PLTR, consider the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio. This collection of 30 stocks has a history of successfully outperforming its benchmark, which includes the three—S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. What accounts for this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index, creating a smoother investment journey, as demonstrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

“The investor’s chief problem – and even his worst enemy – is likely to be himself.”  

Our survival response is innate and, by definition, creates an aversion to pain. The part of the brain responsible for rational decision-making comes secondary to the part that reacts purely on emotion, such as fear and panic. When there is a volatile change in the market, there is an immediate biological response driven by this part of the brain. Only if we can slow this response long enough to have the rational part catch up can we make a calculated, non-emotional decision. 
The first hurdle here is recognizing that the emotional response is biologically far faster than the cognitive one. This is a helpful survival technique when we need to react quickly to avert danger, but it can be costly if we allow an emotion to move our financial decisions. 
The principle of not food shopping when you’re hungry also applies to investing. When the body is physically exhausted, in pain, overwhelmed or not at an optimal physical state- the decisions being made invariably are impacted. In the culture of hustle that sometimes glorifies the lack of sleep and burning the candle on both ends, it’s no surprise that the stress that is felt physically can then translate to a decision that we would regret.
Taking a moment here to check the “hardware” that we are using for our decision making- our body. How has my sleep been? How is my stress level? Is my body functioning optimally or at least close to it, because that is 
Career takeaway: Check in on your own body. This is the primary tool that you have for any kind advancement or growth, though it is often negelected. 
Just as one of the most powerful investing principles is compounding over time, an emotional error can set a portfolio back exponentially, not just incrementally. Knowing this is what can compel us to guard against these kinds of emotional errors the same way we may guard the privacy and security of our accounts. Am I now being infiltrated by an emotion that threatens to hijack my decision-making process and drive me to an error that I can regret? 
There are many specific strategies that you can look into for a deeper dive. Understanding the overall picture first enables you to understand the “why” behind the “how”, which can lead to sustainable changes in investing behavior. 
“If you don’t know who you are, the stock market is an expensive place to find out.”

Emotion drives all of us on one level or another. Which emotion do you find driving you most? Is it fear? Greed? Anxiety? Shame? It may seem obvious on the surface, but it warrants a closer look in the same way that you would need to open up the books of a company you are investing in or acquiring. There is more to the story beneath a surface emotion like fear. Taking time to ask ourselves what is behind the fear can be the difference between noticing a pattern and breaking it, versus living it out in a costly way. 
Our fear response is normal, but costly if not understood well. Taking the time to understand your own emotional decision-making is just as important as clearly understanding your investment strategy. Your portfolio will thank you. "

When the stock market is hitting record highs, it’s easy to feel torn. On one hand, you don’t want to miss out. On the other, you don’t want to buy in right before everything drops.
But Chris Sain, a financial coach, author and motivational speaker, says those fears often keep people from doing the one thing that matters most — getting started.
“The markets like momentum,” Sain told me in our Top 100 Money Experts interview for GoBankingRates.com. “New highs typically lead to more new highs. In 2024, for example, we had 57 new highs. So far in 2025, we’ve had 16. The market likes momentum.”
Sain’s first rule for investors is simple: stop trying to outsmart the market.
“Never try to time the market,” he said. “If you have cash ready to deploy and the market is running high, dollar-cost average your way in. It’s likely looking to go higher.”
He encourages investors to take advantage of pullbacks instead of waiting for the perfect entry point that never comes. “Target the previous high as a viable entry during a market pullback,” he added.
When stocks are climbing, many investors rush to buy in — often with more money than they should. Sain says that’s where people get into trouble.
“In hot markets, one mistake investors make when they’ve missed a massive move is going in too heavy with their position size,” he said. “Consistent automatic deposits are the best approach and help you avoid FOMO.”
For Sain, the real secret is consistency. “Time in the market is better than trying to time the market,” he said. “Invest consistently. Automate your buys and trade with a plan. Risk management is key, and the goal is always capital preservation.”
When markets are surging, it’s easy to get swept up in the excitement — or the fear of missing out. But Sain said that kind of emotional investing often leads to costly mistakes.
He warns against impulsive decisions and emphasizes steady habits. “If you invest automatically, it removes emotion from the equation,” Sain said. “That’s what builds real wealth — not guessing when to buy or sell.”
Sain believes that investing success comes down to balance — both emotionally and financially.
“A well-balanced approach helps keep your emotions in check,” he said. “Dollar-cost averaging promotes good investing habits. Diversification brings peace of mind, and sector investing — such as A.I. and other emerging technologies — helps capture growth and momentum.”
When those pieces work together, Sain says, investors can grow their portfolios without taking unnecessary risks. “When strategies like these are combined and implemented properly, investors can achieve above-average returns consistently in the market,” he said.
Beyond investing, Sain is focused on giving back. He recently launched a $1 million ‘100 Days of Giving’ Tour, traveling across the country to hand out $25,000 checks to families, individuals and small businesses in need of a fresh start.
The tour has already caught national attention with features in Black Enterprise and on his hometown NBC affiliate — but for Sain, the goal goes beyond headlines. “It’s about giving people a financial lifeline — and hope,” he said."

After giving Google Finance an AI overhaul, the tech giant is now looking to give the platform's beta version a significant 'earnings' boost. 
Announced by Google product lead Rose Yao in an X post, Google Finance beta users will now gain access to a new earnings experience, complete with live audio, instant transcripts, and even AI insights ""right when they matter.""
Users will now start seeing a new ""upcoming earnings"" tab, with earnings divided into sections like 'Yesterday,' 'Today,' 'Tomorrow,' 'This week,' and 'Next week.' Additionally, within the section, users have the option to highlight 'All stocks,' or only the stocks saved in their watchlist. 
Tapping on a company highlights their last report, when it was released, the fiscal period it was for, the revenue versus what was initially estimated, and an audio recording of the report. 
There's also an intelligent transcript section that lets you skim through the earnings call and begin listening from timestamped sections. Alternatively, users also have the option to go through the earnings report in the form of presentation slides, though this depends on the company and if it provided said slides. 
There's a 'previous reports' section to help you track growth or decline, paired with 'at a glance' insights (gathered from news and other sources) for quick snippets. 
According to Yao, this has rolled out to everyone with the new Google Finance experience in the US. I'm in Canada, and the new earnings section is available to me, so the rollout might just be wider than initially announced. Check www.google.com/finance/beta, the new experience might have rolled out to you too!

Asian equities were mixed, as Japan and South Korea outperformed, while Mainland China and Hong Kong underperformed.
“Buy the rumor and sell the news” appears to have been a factor in Hong Kong’s weakness, as the Trump-Xi truce underwhelms, meeting the base case in the short-term. US Trade Representative Greer’s comments on continuing China’s adherence garnered attention from the perpetually negative Western media. Reuters published an articled titled “After trade truce, China becomes a bit more investible” that was aligned with our view that US institutions have remained on the China investing sidelines, due to the geopolitical headwinds. China’s media noted Trump’s use of the term “G2” in describing the US and China. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also met with his Chinese counterpart Dong Jun in Kuala Lumpur.
October’s “official” purchasing managers’ indexes (PMIs) were mixed, as Manufacturing declined month-over-month (MoM) to 49.0 versus September’s 49.8 and expectations of 49.6, led lower by production and new orders. The Non-Manufacturing PMI was unchanged month-over-month at 50.1, which met expectations with business activity rebounding while construction was a drag. Readings above 50 indicate expansion, while readings below 50 indicate contraction. The release did not help sentiment, as the government’s focus on the new Five-Year Plan might have been a distraction from implementing stimulus and/or cutting rates today.
All things growth were hit, as the Australian saying goes: “the tall poppy gets cut”. Internet, technology hardware, semiconductors, autos, electric vehicles, and electric vehicle batteries were all lower. Hong Kong’s volumes were weak, as the Hang Seng closed below the 26,000 level and the Hang Seng Tech Index closed below the 6,000 level.
The only positive sector in Hong Kong was healthcare, as biotech company 3SBio gained +11.27%, as Pfizer tests the company’s lung and colorectal cancer drugs. Biotech peer Innovent gained +7.81%, as results from their work with US pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly are expected next week. Biotech and green energy aren’t recognized as AI plays, though I suspect they are.
Mainland investors feared not, buying $1.11 billion worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs via Southbound Stock Connect today. There was a very similar, possibly identical, situation in Mainland China, though not quite as severe: technology hardware, semiconductors, non-ferrous metals, and insurance were all off.
Several government agency heads published articles on how their departments would implement the draft 15th 5-Year Plan, including an article from the People’s Bank of China titled “Building a scientific and prudent monetary policy system and covering a comprehensive macro–Prudential Management System"". The Ministry of Finance (MoF) said it would ""play the role of active fiscal policy"" in a paper. The Ministry of Commerce (MoC) spoke about “Expanding high-level opening up"". Finally, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development published ""Promoting the High-quality Development of Real Estate”.
The MoF’s piece jumped out. Its plan is to “First, comprehensively expand domestic demand and support the construction of a strong domestic market” and “Second, we will support high-level self-reliance in science and technology to promote the rapid development of new quality productive forces.” 
Wu Qing, the Chaiman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), China’s SEC, wrote an article on how the financial regulator’s capital markets portions are now geared to financing science and technology companies, raising the quality of listed companies, and attracting foreign capital.
Education technology and tutoring company TAL Education reported third quarter financial results before the US open yesterday. The results speak for themselves! It is worth noting that the stock is 83% below its all-time high even after yesterday’s 7.23% rally. The highlights are as follows.

INTU serves as Oracle's counterpart in the Application Software sector, which possesses:
1) A lower valuation (P/OpInc) in comparison to Oracle stock2) However, it demonstrates superior revenue and operating income growth
This disparity between valuation and performance suggests that purchasing INTU stock might be preferable to acquiring ORCL stock
Oracle stock has been riding a wave of hype largely driven by investor enthusiasm over its expanding role in artificial intelligence and cloud infrastructure. The company’s strategic partnerships—particularly with Nvidia—and its aggressive push into AI-driven cloud services have positioned it as a credible challenger to hyperscalers like Amazon and Microsoft. Strong growth in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and surging demand for its AI-ready databases have fueled bullish sentiment, with investors betting that Oracle’s legacy enterprise customer base gives it a unique advantage in monetizing AI workloads. While fundamentals remain solid, much of the recent rally reflects high expectations for future growth rather than current earnings strength, making the stock feel more momentum-driven than value-based.
Over time, markets reward quality, which is precisely what the High Quality Portfolio encapsulates.
Key Metrics Reviewed
Do these figures provide a complete narrative? Consult Buy or Sell ORCL Stock to determine if Oracle still possesses an advantage that remains relevant. To give you a quick overview, Oracle (ORCL) offers cloud software as a service, domain-specific cloud solutions, application licenses, license support, an enterprise database, a development language, and middleware services.
This represents just one method to assess investments. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio evaluates a broader range of factors and is designed to minimize stock-specific risks while providing upside potential.
Is The Discrepancy In Stock Price Temporary?
One approach to assess whether Oracle stock is currently overpriced relative to other tickers is to compare how these metrics stood across companies precisely one year ago. If there has been a significant reversal in Oracle's trend over the past 12 months, this could indicate that the current discrepancy is likely to correct. Conversely, ongoing underperformance in revenue and operating income growth for Oracle might solidify the argument that the stock is overpriced in relation to its competitors and may not adjust anytime soon.
Key Metrics Compared 1 Year Ago
Further Metrics to Think About
While buying based on valuation looks appealing, it needs careful assessment from various perspectives. This multi-factor approach is precisely how we design Trefis portfolio strategies. If you seek upside with a smoother experience than with an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P and generated over 105% returns since its inception."

As Alphabet pours billions into AI infrastructure and unveils tools like Pomelli to empower small businesses, the stakes for Google’s future have never been higher. Will it emerge as the dominant AI operating system—or drown in its own capital expenditure ambitions?
In Q3 2025, Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft collectively invested approximately $80 billion in AI infrastructure. This isn’t just a number—it’s perhaps an early signal. These tech giants are betting on a future where artificial intelligence isn't just a feature but the foundation of their next growth phase. While Alphabet's stock surged on the back of this aggressive investment, Meta's tumbled, reflecting a market divided over whether these expenditures will translate into sustainable income or become sunk costs.
Amid this backdrop, Google’s unveiling of “Pomelli,” an AI-powered tool that automatically generates social media campaigns for small and midsize businesses (SMBs), provides a glimpse into how Alphabet plans to monetize its AI muscle beyond search.  This confluence of massive CapEx, AI-native product rollouts, and investor skepticism raises a pressing question: Can Alphabet turn AI into its next revenue flywheel—or is it just automating the margins?
Google’s new tool, Pomelli, operates as a full-stack social media content engine. By scanning a business’s website, it identifies brand elements like tone, colors, and fonts, then generates complete, editable social campaigns that can be downloaded and deployed instantly.  At first glance, this might seem like a small feature targeted at a niche audience. But under the hood, Pomelli reveals something bigger: Google is building AI tools as utilities, quietly embedding itself into the marketing infrastructure of SMBs, which make up 99.9% of all U.S. businesses, according to the U.S. Small Business Administration.
Why it matters:
This isn’t just about helping SMBs post on Instagram. It’s perhaps a step towards owning the new interface where AI meets business utility.
Alphabet’s Pomelli is just one surface application riding on top of a deep well of investment. In Q3, the company funneled tens of billions into AI infrastructure, joining Meta and Microsoft in a capital-intensive sprint to build out AI data centers, custom chips (like Google’s TPUs), and edge capabilities. But while Meta’s CapEx seemed to rattle investors, Alphabet was rewarded. Why?
Yet, risks remain. As Charlie Munger once warned, “The big money is not in the buying or the selling, but in the waiting.” Investors must decide if this is a waiting game they can afford.
Pomelli is more than an AI tool—it could be a signal of Google’s ambition to become the default AI operating system for business. From marketing automation to productivity, the company is inching toward a future where its AI tools become indispensable digital co-pilots.  Think of it this way: just as Android became the plumbing of the mobile web, Google’s AI could become the plumbing of AI-driven business workflows.  
Alphabet’s approach to AI—both in infrastructure and application—suggests a deep vertical integration strategy: build the tools, own the stack, then dominate the use cases. Tools like Pomelli might seem incremental, but they reflect a massive shift in how Google envisions the future of software: AI-native, automated, and universal.
Yet this future isn’t guaranteed. The risks are real. CapEx drag, regulatory scrutiny, and the potential for AI-generated content saturation could all derail progress.  Still, Alphabet has one thing few others do: a proven history of monetizing scale.
Whether Pomelli becomes a footnote or a foundational tool will depend on execution—but Alphabet’s trajectory signals that this is only the beginning."

Fourteen years ago, Dave Ferguson joined a team of around 12 people to work on the Google self-driving car project, which is now Waymo.
Now, he's going head-to-head with the self-driving cars made by his alma mater. On Wednesday, Nuro, the company co-founded by Ferguson, announced that it will deploy robotaxis in San Francisco next year
Nuro, co-founded in 2016 by Ferguson and Jiajun (JZ) Zhu, another alumnus of Google's self-driving car project, partnered with Uber to develop a fleet of robotaxis using Lucid's Gravity SUV.
Uber chose San Francisco for its first market — one where hundreds of Waymos are already open for business.
In an interview with Business Insider, Ferguson said that Uber, being the ""largest ride-hailing network in the world,"" presents an opportunity to scale robotaxis at a competitive price point.
He named two factors at play: Nuro's ""dramatically less expensive"" technology stack, and the Uber platform, which has nearly 9 million drivers and couriers.
""There's an incredible economy of scale there,"" he said.
Uber said in July that it plans to deploy 20,000 or more robotaxis using Nuro's self-driving technology and Lucid's Gravity SUV, a nearly $80,000 car.
Ferguson told BI that the Gravity will help capture riders of Uber Black, the ride-hailing platform's premium service, as well as UberXL and UberX. That doesn't mean the Nuro Driver won't be in other vehicle platforms, he said.
Business Insider spoke with Ferguson at TechCrunch Disrupt in San Francisco to talk about the lessons he's learned at Google's self-driving car project, why he believes he can compete with what is now Waymo, and what it will take to scale robotaxis.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Do you take Waymos often?
I do. I love it. JZ, my cofounder, and I were part of Google's self-driving car project, and we left just before it was renamed Waymo. I've basically spent my whole career on self-driving, so being in a Waymo is still a real treat.
What's it like to meet your alma mater on the public stage in San Francisco nine years after founding Nuro?
It's great. We still have a great relationship with a lot of the key folks. Dmitri (Waymo's Co-CEO) is still a friend, an amazing guy. I think there's a lot of love there.
If you go back far enough, the original genesis of the self-driving industry, at least in the US, is a very small group of people from a few universities. It's a pretty tight-knit community, despite the fact that many of us are now at different companies. Some of it may be competitive, some may be collaborative.
Are there lessons you've learned from Google that you've applied to founding Nuro and now deploying robotaxis?
The team is everything. For JZ and I, when we started Nuro, it was critical to us that we put together a team of the absolute best talent. A-players attract A-players. Looking back nine years later, that is where all of the success we may have had can be attributed to.
Also, make sure that you're working on something that matters and that you have strategic clarity. It's not enough to just build great tech. You have to have figured out the path to get that tech to actually do something interesting and scale.
On this exclusive partnership with Uber: Does it give Uber the opportunity to tell other companies like Waymo, ""Hey, we know you guys are doing your own thing, well, we have our own service as well.""
This was an opportunity for Uber to play a really key role in deciding what the product will be: the in-car experience, the hailing experience, pickup, and drop-off. So it was an opportunity for Uber to be much more involved in the design of the product piece.
What's the consumer proposition? Many people simply want the cheapest and quickest ride.
Uber's the largest ride-hailing network in the world, so there's an incredible economy of scale there. There's no reason, long-term, that Uber won't have a product that both blows people away in terms of quality user experience and is the one leading in terms of cost.
Gravity is a premium vehicle. It's going to be able to capture a lot of Uber's current wide market in terms of the premium side, Uber Black. It will also be able to capture UberXL and UberX.
There will be other (vehicle) platforms with Lucid that will be a lower price point that perhaps will scale for UberX, but even the Gravity itself is going to provide a compelling price proposition.
Part of the reason for that is that the technology that Nuro is bringing — all of the sensing and compute — is dramatically less expensive than other L4 players today. So even if the vehicle is not incredibly low-cost, it's still very cost-effective.
Is the sensor stack much lighter than Waymo's?
It's camera, lidar, radar, so it's all of the usual suspects. However, it utilizes off-the-shelf, automotive-grade sensors, so we don't have to manufacture any custom sensors.
Lucid designed an incredibly beautiful vehicle, and we wanted to ensure that, when we installed the sensor stack, it didn't detract from that and suddenly make it look like a Frankenstein.
There's no spinning lidar; all solid state.
Consumers may see edge-case stories like a robotaxi driving in circles and think that the technology isn't quite there. How do you close that gap?
I think it will close over time. We're already at the point where the technology has proven that it is not only capable of being a product, but it's a preferred product over the alternative.
So, yes, there will still be some edges that need smoothing, and there are still some technical improvements that we'll all make over time, but it's already at a point where people prefer the alternative, which is an incredible place for it to be.
What are those key technical challenges?
Some of the general challenges include expanding to all weather, particularly snow. That's something most of us in this space have held off on because there's a huge opportunity and a lot of impact that we can have before needing to tackle snow. However, we have confidence that we will be able to do it.
The lidar vs. camera debate: How do you see it?
We strongly believe that lidar is a highly valuable sensor for fully autonomous driving. But it's not lidar versus camera, because everyone is going to use cameras. The question is: Should we put lidars on that car or not?
From a physics perspective, it's complementary information to what you get from a camera. If you have an AI system with cameras, radars, and then lidar — because there is some non-redundant information that's coming off that lidar — that AI system should theoretically be able to do a better job. So, from a theoretical perspective, the ceiling is higher if you have lidar. The question is how much higher? How much value are you actually getting from the lidar?
In terms of actual hardware cost, I think it's a no-brainer. When we started at Google, the cost of a single lidar was like $75,000. Today, it's like 500 bucks.
So, if there is any incremental benefit you're getting from having a lidar, then it becomes a pretty easy decision.
But you're not saying cameras-only won't work, right?
Often, the argument is that, as humans, we have two cameras. So, theoretically, if humans can drive, then cameras on your system should be able to do it. I think there are a couple of challenges with that statement.
The cameras that we have today are not nearly as good as our eyes.
The second point is, even if you can have a system that can drive as well as a human with just today's cameras — if it's $500 extra to add a lidar and it's going to increase the safety of that system significantly, why would you not do that?
What's the great bottleneck then for robotaxis? Is it the technology, infrastructure, or even human adoption?
I think it's really about scaling fleets, that is, having a vehicle that is low-cost enough and available to manufacture in sufficient numbers, and then all the operational parts, such as having depots where you can store and maintain a large number of vehicles. Those are two significant challenges that, I'd say, currently limit today's scale.
We hope to address both of them through our partnership with Uber and Lucid. Lucid is going to manufacture vehicles off their manufacturing line. Uber is building out all of the depot infrastructure to own and operate these very large fleets, and they're going to do it at Uber scale.

Despite posting smaller-than-expected loss for 3Q 2025, JetBlue Airways Corporation (NASDAQ: JBLU) stock took a nosedive of about 12% over a cautious 2025 outlook and concerns over higher costs and intense competition. Though the operating revenue came in line with the analyst expectations at $2.32 billion, it was down 1.8% year-over-year (y-o-y), largely due to softness in core cabin segment. Amid the slowdown in the U.S. domestic market and growing operating costs, JetBlue’s management appears conservative in its 2025 targets and will need to optimize its capacity to mitigate the impact of rising costs. The low-cost carrier will also continue to focus on the high-margin premium services through its JetForward strategy, which unfortunately has not reaped much benefit over the last few quarters.
The New York-based airline ended the third quarter with 283 aircraft – all A220s and A320-family jets – in its operating fleet. Despite weather and air traffic control challenges in July, strong performance in August and September cushioned the quarter’s disruptions. System capacity, also known as available seat miles (ASMs), increased 0.9% y-o-y, at the top of the company’s revised guidance range. Load factor stood at 85.1%, slightly lower than the prior year’s 86.6%. Revenue per available seat mile (RASM) declined 2.7% y-o-y but was still better than the company’s initially forecast due to robust close-in bookings and continued strength in premium products. 
The airline’s Mint® offering continued to outperform the core cabin, with premium RASM six points higher than core, underlining the growing preference among travellers for upgraded seating and experiences. JetBlue’s TrueBlue® loyalty program also delivered strong momentum, with revenue up 12% y-o-y, driven by double-digit growth in co-brand credit-card sign-ups and higher loyalty redemption activity. Customer satisfaction continued to trend upward, with the Net Promoter Score up low-single digits for the quarter and double digits year-to-date, underscoring the carrier’s progress in operational consistency and service quality.
Operating expenses rose modestly by 0.8% y-o-y to $2.42 billion, as savings from lower fuel costs were partially offset by higher maintenance expenses and labor costs. JetBlue’s average fuel price was $2.49 per gallon, 7% lower y-o-y, contributing to a 7.6% decline in total fuel expense to $539 million. Excluding fuel, non-airline costs, and special items, CASM ex-fuel increased 3.7%, due to ongoing inflationary pressures in wages and airport rents. 
At the end of the quarter, the carrier held cash and cash equivalent of $2.4 billion against total debt of $8.5 billion. Capital expenditure was $281 million for the quarter, much below the company’s revised estimate of $325 million. JetBlue also completed the retirement of its Embraer E190 fleet, transitioning to an all-Airbus lineup that will enhance fuel efficiency and simplify maintenance operations going forward.
Management remains cautious heading into the final quarter of the year. JetBlue expects capacity to range between a decline of 0.75% and an increase of 2.25% y-o-y, reflecting measured capacity discipline as the airline continues to balance demand recovery with network optimization. Unit revenue or RASM is expected to decline between 4% and flat compared to the prior year, as the softness in core cabin yields is likely to be offset by stronger premium demand and improved booking. On the cost side, the carrier anticipates non-fuel unit costs (CASM ex-fuel) to rise between 3% and 5% y-o-y, due to higher wages, landing fees, and technology investments, partially offset by savings from its JetForward initiatives. The airline expects average fuel prices to range between $2.33 and $2.48 per gallon during 4Q 2025, in line with its hedging assumptions and current market trends.
For full year 2025, the airline improved the midpoint of its cost guidance by half a point, now targeting CASM ex-fuel growth of 5% to 6%, even as capacity remains roughly one point lower than initially planned. Capital expenditure is expected to decline in FY 2026 through the end of the decade, mostly below $1 billion annually, as the airline pivots to a capital-light strategy and ramps up JetForward. The airline expects to generate $290 million of incremental EBIT from JetForward by year-end, building upon the $180 million achieved to date. The JetForward initiative include AI-driven customer self-service, advanced crew-management tools, and data-led fuel optimization. 
JetBlue continues to strengthen its East Coast leisure franchise, particularly in Fort Lauderdale, where it plans to launch 17 new routes and add frequencies on 12 existing markets in 2025, representing a 35% y-o-y in schedule. The carrier also announced new service from New York–JFK and Boston–Logan to Vero Beach and Daytona Beach, as well as new connections from Tampa and Fort Myers to Islip, expanding its footprint across Florida. As part of its product evolution, JetBlue will roll out a domestic first-class product in 2026, retrofitting 25% of its non-Mint fleet next year and completing the majority by 2027. Its new JetBlue Lounges at JFK and Boston are set to open in late 2025 and 2026, respectively. Moreover, the airline has announced a partnership with Amazon’s Project Kuiper to enhance in-flight connectivity beginning in 2027, reinforcing its position as a leader in onboard digital experience. Furthermore, the airline has recently commenced its collaboration with United Airlines, Blue Sky, which enables JetBlue to offer point accrual and redemption across loyalty ecosystems, resulting in a double-digit increase in card acquisition. This partnership aims to enhance customer loyalty and expand market reach.
Although JetBlue delivered a decent third-quarter performance, the broader U.S. airline sector continues to navigate a mixed demand environment and pricing pressure in the core cabin. While the company has managed to establish itself as a leading carrier in Fort Lauderdale, it is still struggling to bring its earnings in the black despite cost control measures and optimizing its capacity. The airline aims to focus on premium services to expand its top line while managing its costs and capacity. However, successful execution of JetForward, alongside the ramp-up of Blue Sky and network expansion in Fort Lauderdale, will be crucial for the company to regain investor confidence and a meaningful share in the U.S. aviation space.

Big Tech's AI gold rush isn't slowing down— it's getting more expensive.
Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft all opened their wallets wider than ever this quarter, logging record-breaking capital expenditures on AI chips, servers, and data centers.
Microsoft was the top spender at nearly $35 billion, narrowly beating Amazon. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company could increase its long-term asset spending, or capital expenditure (capex), by as much as 24% next year. Each company said it planned to spend even more on capex going forward.
A few recent deals exemplify this trend. Amazon this week opened an $11 billion data center in Indiana, part of its massive AI supercluster called Project Rainier, and said it would spend $5 billion on data centers in South Korea. Microsoft recently joined a consortium of investors to buy 50 data centers in the US and Latin America for $40 billion.
Even Apple, a notoriously restrained spender compared to the other hyperscalers, told investors that it expects capex spending to increase in the next fiscal year.
Investors are watching closely: companies showing early AI payoffs, like Google, are being rewarded, while others — like Meta — are running out of time to prove the spending spree is worth it.
""After all the expensive hires and the capex ramp, Meta's grace period for showing investors something on the non-core AI side is nearly up,"" Bernstein senior analyst Mark Shmulik said Wednesday in a research note.
The question for investors: which of these giants can turn that spending into actual AI returns — and which are just building costlier foundations for the future?
Capital expenditures in the company's most recent fiscal quarter were driven by growing demand for cloud and AI offerings, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood said Wednesday.
The nearly $35 billion in spending represents a 74% increase from the same time period last year.
Roughly half of that spend went primarily to GPUs and CPUs, which Hood referred to as ""short-lived assets.""
Microsoft spent $11.1 billion on data center leasing alone for the quarter.
The company previously forecasted $30 billion in capex for the quarter.
Amazon spent $34.2 billion in capex in the third quarter. The world's largest cloud provider said it expects to spend $125 billion this year in capex, up significantly from $83 billion in 2024.
Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said the company plans to spend even more on capex in 2026 as it looks to double its data center capacity in the next two years.
Meta spent $19.4 billion on capex in the third quarter, and is projecting 'notably higher growth' next year. Meta also adjusted its capex guidance range for 2025 from $70 billion to $72 billion, up from its previous estimate of $66 billion to $72 billion last quarter.
That's almost double the amount — $39.2 billion total — Meta spent on capex in 2024.
""We're seeing very high demand for additional compute,"" CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors on the company's third-quarter earnings call Wednesday.
The company expects to spend $116 billion to $118 billion on infrastructure costs next year, representing a 22% to 24% increase from 2025.
Meta is building its own data centers and contracting space through third parties. It recently raised $29 billion for its massive data center project in Louisiana from firms including Pacific Investment Management Company and Blue Owl Capital.
CFO Anat Ashkenazi told investors on the company's earnings call Wednesday that the ""vast majority"" of capex was spent on AI infrastructure.
Approximately 60% of the spend went to chips and servers, while 40% went to networking equipment and data centers.
Google raised its capex guidance for the year, projecting a range of $91 billion to $93 billion, up from its previous estimate of $85 billion.
""We're continuing to invest aggressively due to the demand we're seeing from cloud customers, as well as the growth opportunities we see across the company,"" Ashkenazi said.
Google parent Alphabet's stock jumped yesterday after it reported a boost in revenue growth from its cloud division in the third quarter.
Wall Street seemed less concerned about its parent company's capex raise compared to those of its Big Tech peers.
The third quarter was a ""pretty solid flex"" for Google, ""around the AI bull case,"" Barclays analysts said in a research note on Wednesday.

71,2025-10-31,"Among all the tree nuts that we eat, Brazil nuts stand out. They're large, pale, and rich in oils that give them a creamy, coconutty flavor, and offer a high fiber content. These dense little guys are one of the most concentrated sources of magnesium and selenium in the natural world. 
A one-ounce serving of about six Brazil nuts contains over 100 milligrams of magnesium (about 18 milligrams per nut). The recommended amount of magnesium per day is around 300 milligrams for adult women and around 400 milligrams for men. But that serving of Brazil nuts also contains roughly ten times the daily requirement of selenium, which is why experts recommend no more than five nuts per day, max. While selenium is good for you in moderation, too much can cause health problems.
Magnesium supports more than 300 enzyme systems in the body, influencing muscle relaxation, nerve conduction, and energy metabolism. It stabilizes blood sugar, and helps regulate mood and sleep. Selenium also helps protect cells from damage and assists the working of thyroid hormones. Basically, these two minerals support systems that get frazzled when you are wearing thin under stress.
They are also essential nutrients that the body cannot make itself. Magnesium, selenium, and other trace elements must come from food. The balance is narrow, with too little leading to deficiency, too much to toxicity. The best thing about whole foods is that when eaten in regular dietary amounts, they don't really push those limits. Two Brazil nuts meet daily selenium needs – don't double up with vitamin supplements. Eaten with fruits or greens, like on top of a salad or in a nutrient-dense black forest smoothie, they add structure to the diet's mineral foundation rather than overloading it. 
Magnesium exists in several absorbable forms, each tied to a different role, which can get really confusing when you're staring at a shelf of vitamins at the store. Magnesium glycinate is often used for calm and sleep, citrate for digestion, malate for cellular energy, and l-threonate for cognition. Supplements isolate these forms, and charge an arm and a leg for them, but in food they coexist naturally, buffered helpfully by fiber and fat. That synergy makes dietary magnesium gentler on the system and better retained. 
When people fall short on magnesium, which many do, they can show signs of hypomagnesemia, which are fatigue, muscle tension and low resilience to stress. Common, delicious foods like pumpkin seeds, cashews, almonds, lentils, dark chocolate, and cherries all contain bioavailable magnesium, but Brazil nuts rank among the highest per ounce. Their selenium content adds another layer, supporting immune function, fertility, and antioxidant defense. Selenium accumulates if your body doesn't use it, and one or two nuts a day equal roughly 70 to 180 micrograms of selenium, covering daily requirements without approaching the upper limit of 400 micrograms.
It's important to pay attention to sourcing, which influences quality. Many Brazil nuts are wild-harvested in the Amazon, falling naturally from trees that thrive in undisturbed forest soil. Some are certified organic, which ensures minimal pesticide exposure and better storage standards. Nuts stored too long or handled in humid conditions risk mold growth, so freshness is worth the price difference. The best flavor means good handling, with a firm, clean snap rather than softness or acrid bitterness. Buying from a supplier that rotates stock quickly is as practical as choosing organic, in this case."

Samsung's Galaxy XR is the hot new VR headset in town, seamlessly blending the real and virtual worlds into a compelling XR space. But this headset isn't some boring old PC VR headset that you need a computer to operate. It's a fully standalone computer that you can comfortably wear for hours at a time, and that's why it's replacing my main workstation setup this year.
That might sound crazy, but there's something spectacularly amazing about being able to put my monitors anywhere I want without setting up mounting hardware. Not only that, but they can be resized and reshaped, so I can have an ultra-ultra-ultrawide monitor, a tall monitor, or even a square monitor if I really wanted to.
This same concept applies to any Android app you want to run on the headset. If you've used a Galaxy Z Fold 7, you'll already be familiar with how app window resizing works. Since the Galaxy XR runs on Android XR, a new version of Android specifically designed for XR devices, it can also run all Google Play apps without developers specifically needing to build an app for the headset.
 



That's a massive improvement over every other VR or XR headset on the market and it also means that I can seamlessly run Android apps alongside the monitors for my Windows 11 laptop without skipping a beat. Since I'm knee-deep in the Google ecosystem, this means all my devices can tie into my Galaxy XR experience without me having to fiddle around.
Folks using a Galaxy XR to work on their PCs have two main options: use a Samsung GalaxyBook, which has built-in hooks to connect to Galaxy XR, or download the Virtual Desktop app from the Google Play Store. Virtual Desktop has been my preferred PC-to-VR connection software for years and it works on any platform you want to use, from PCs to Macs, and even different wireless VR headsets.
Samsung specifically worked with the developer of Virtual Desktop to ensure the highest quality ""Monster"" resolution and bitrate were available from day-one on Galaxy XR. If you've got a Wi-Fi 7 router, that experience will be even better thanks to the ultra-high bandwidth and low latency of these next-gen networking powerhouses.

The app supports up to 3 virtual monitors streaming from your PC, all of which are resizable and scalable as I previously noted. Virtual Desktop can also be used to easily play SteamVR games on your PC, adding one more feather to its proverbial hat.

Since these virtual monitors simply ""float"" in real space, I can sit anywhere I'd like and still have my full desk setup. That means at my dining room table, on my couch, on a plane, in an airport, a hotel, or even my in-laws house. That's a powerful way to work, especially if you have the freedom of working remotely.
On the entertainment side of things, I'm a huge proponent for portable devices. I got rid of my gaming PC years ago for a Steam Deck, and I primarily play console games on systems like the Nintendo Switch 2 since I can undock it and play anywhere I want.
 



Galaxy XR provides the same level of freedom with a metric ton of available content. Not only do you get access to every game in the Google Play Store, but you also have access to the best streaming services like GeForce Now, Xbox Game Pass, and more. There are even apps to stream your home consoles — like a PS5 — to the headset.
And while I love a good handheld gaming console, this experience trumps that one since you don't have to look down at a device or hold it up for long periods of time, alleviating a common source of strain during long gaming sessions. That screen can be placed anywhere you want and it never has to be held up. It's a win-win!
None of this would even be worthwhile without a good display or comfortable build but, thankfully, Galaxy XR has those angles covered, too. The design is made to keep all the weight off your face, ensuring that your cheeks don't feel heavy after just a few minutes and that it's easy to eat and drink while wearing the headset. You probably didn't think about that part until just now, but it's a problem the Galaxy XR's open side design solves.
 



With the highest-resolution micro-OLED displays on any wireless headset to date, the 29 million pixels of self-emissive glory will light up your content with the deep contrast and colors OLED is known for. Plus, at 90Hz, everything will be buttery smooth.
I'm not much of a TV watcher, but I know that the plethora of options for streaming and video services on Android will also ensure this is an excellent replacement for any TV, especially since you can take it with you. That theater you see above isn't real; it's a virtual theater from the Virtual Desktop app, and it makes immersive watching a ridulously impressive experience.
Imagine having the best display you've probably ever seen with you anywhere you go, with the ability to run all your favorite apps and services on it when you want it. That's Galaxy XR.
 




Get the best micro-OLED display on any wireless XR headset with the power of Android XR, all inside the comfortable Galaxy XR from Samsung.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Samsung's Galaxy Z Trifold will be officially launched soon. Well, here is if you live in one of the markets where the phone will likely launch; that doesn't include North America. Of course, nothing is official until it's said out loud and made official, but I don't see any indication of a worldwide launch. That's smart.
Supposedly, the Trifold is set to launch in a handful of Asian markets with no word on a release anywhere else, which is exactly what Samsung needs to do with this one. You really only need to remember the launch of the first Galaxy Z Fold to understand why. The phone was generally well-received, but even more so in places like South Korea and less so in the U.S. There are three reasons why.
 



The first is the price. I can't tell you what a U.S. MSRP of the Galaxy Z Trifold would be, but I can tell you it would be sky high. Like $2,500+ range. Maybe that's not a bad price because of the cost to design and build it (especially the initial model), but most people aren't going to think like that. They will see a giant price and scoff, which isn't good for business. When consumers start to think of high prices when considering a brand of product, they look at others a little more.
Next, there are going to be problems. Honestly, I don't think the device will have too many issues, but a first generation that's this complicated has to have a few. A few issues with a device that costs as much as a used car aren't going to sit well. It shouldn't sit well. Besides the bad press and pictures of faulty foldables, the stigma that the original Fold had of being a ""bad product"" lasted longer than it should have. Even now, many feel foldables are fragile, finicky devices that aren't going to last as long as it takes to pay them off. All this was because a handful of the first ones sold were plastered all over social media, showing their problems.
 



Now let's talk about the Asian market. Specifically, Samsung's homeland of South Korea. Any issues are going to affect these phones just like they would in the U.S. The price is going to be crazy high, just like it would be in North America or Europe. None of that will change, but the response to them would.
Asian tech consumers are savvy, maybe more savvy than most of us, because they are exposed to all sorts of products we don't get to see in the West. They will see the problems, know it's priced very high, and want it anyway.
The tech culture for much of Asia is different from ours, and many consumers are ready to try something new and know that it will cost them. In the U.S, we call those people ""early adopters,"" and there are a few. There are more of them in other parts of the world, though.
Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android
In South Korea specifically, there is another thing: national pride. If Samsung were a North American company, things would be identical, and Americans would take pride in supporting the largest maker of electronics the world has ever seen. Samsung deserves it.
This pride in knowing the best devices come from ""home"" won't make issues go away, but it will make them more accepted. We know this because a lot of people bought American cars in the 1970s and '80s, even though a superior product was available from Japan or Europe. It was a sense of national pride, and buying ""American"" was important.
 



I'm looking forward to checking out a good ""trifold"" Android phone, and chances are it will be one from Samsung. What can I say? I hate a lot of what the company does, but I also think they make the best consumer electronics money can buy.
I don't look forward to spending too much to do it and being plagued with problems that might not be fixable in a first-generation product. I want to see version two, or maybe even version three. For that to happen, version one has to be a success, and keeping it in Asia, close to home, is a good move to help it become one.

76,2025-10-31,"Toyota is a gigantic company that serves all markets. As a reminder of that, this three-wheeled LS Micro concept by Toyota's Lexus arm is the polar opposite, in terms of both style and function, of their IMV Origin vehicle.
 
The LS Micro was just unveiled at the 2025 Japan Mobility Show, so at press time there was no explanatory press materials. The brief description of the concept is that it provides ""autonomous chaffeur capability"" to the luxury market, and that ""its role is to deliver unparalleled luxury and presence, specifically handling the last mile of travel in urban areas.""
 
So it's basically a single-seat people mover. And unlike autonomous taxis designed to move groups, like Amazon's Zoox, there is no generous glazing designed to give passengers an unobstructed view of the surroundings. Instead, this being luxury-targeted, the passenger is visually shielded from the outside world, ensconced in a sort of throne with blinders.
 
As with most of their concepts, Lexus loses me with their design language; not being the target market, I can't quite grasp the pastiche of angles and arbitrary forms that make up the exterior and interior.
 
 
 
If there's any one design motif here, it seems to be ""repeating series of parallel lines.""

Deckers Outdoor (DECK) stock has decreased by 22.1% in under a month, dropping from $103.80 on 10/2/2025 to $80.89 at present. What is next? We believe there is a strong possibility of a stock recovery given the historical patterns of recovery after declines and our current Attractive assessment of the stock. Buying during dips is a proven strategy for high-quality stocks that have a track record of bouncing back from downturns.
Deckers posted respectable results in its most recent quarter — revenue rose about 9% year-over-year and EPS came in ahead of expectations. However, the problem came with the guidance and underlying headwinds: management gave a cautious outlook for full-year sales, citing consumer pull-back, tariff and cost pressures, and softness in its big brands such as UGG (direct‐to‐consumer sales dropped) and a slowing growth rate compared to historic levels. In short: good quarter, but weak future visibility, which spooked investors and sent the price down.
What could push it up? If Deckers can restore confidence in its growth trajectory, the stock could bounce. Key levers would include stronger than expected growth in the HOKA and UGG brands (especially if the brand momentum picks up again), improvement in margins (by offsetting cost/tariff pressures through pricing, sourcing or operational efficiencies), and clearer guidance that alleviates concerns about consumer demand. A refreshed marketing push, new product hits, or expanding into faster-growing international markets could also serve as catalysts.
It turns out that DECK stock meets fundamental quality criteria. Historically, the stock has given a median return of 58% over one year, and 74% at peak return after experiencing sharp declines (>30% in 30 days). For quick context, DECK offers footwear, apparel, and accessories for both casual and high-performance uses, selling through department stores, specialty shops, and running 140 global retail outlets as of March 2021.
For more information on stock fundamentals and evaluations, read Buy or Sell Deckers Outdoor Stock to understand the complete picture. Investing in a single stock can be risky, but adhering to a more extensive, diversified strategy is highly valuable, as seen in the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Trefis collaborates with Empirical Asset Management—a wealth management firm located in the Boston area—whose asset allocation strategies delivered positive returns during the 2008-09 recession when the S&P lost over 40%. Empirical has integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio within its asset allocation framework to provide clients with higher returns while accepting lower risk compared to the benchmark index.
Historical Median Returns Post Dips
Historical Dip-Wise Details DECK has experienced 4 instances since 1/1/2010 where the decline threshold of -30% within 30 days was reached
Deckers Outdoor Passes Basic Financial Quality Checks To decrease the risk of a dip being indicative of a declining business situation, an assessment of revenue growth, profitability, cash flow, and balance sheet strength is essential.
While dip buying is appealing, it requires thorough evaluation from various perspectives. This multi-faceted analysis is precisely how we shape the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, which has a history of significantly outperforming its benchmark, including all three—the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and the Russell 2000 indices. Why is this so? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; avoiding the volatile ups and downs, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics."
81,2025-10-31,"Apple is expected to launch a new foldable iPhone next year, based on multiple rumors and credible sources. The long-awaited device has been rumored for years now, but signs increasingly suggest that 2026 could indeed be the year that Apple releases its first foldable device.
Below, we've collated an updated set of key details that have been leaked about Apple's foldable iPhone so far.
Overall Design
Book-Style
According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple's foldable iPhone is similar in style to Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold, which uses a book-style folding mechanism, rather than the clamshell design of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip. Industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo expects the foldable ‌iPhone‌ to measure between 9 and 9.5 mm when folded, and around 4.5 to 4.8 mm when unfolded. More recently, Weibo-based leaker Instant Digital has said that the foldable iPhone will have a thickness of at least 4.8mm.
Display Sizes
Dual Screens
When folded, users will interact with a 5.5-inch outer display that is similar to a typical iPhone screen, while unfolding it will reveal a larger 7.8-inch iPad-style screen. The inner display is said to be virtually crease-free, thanks to Apple's use of a metal plate that can disperse and control the stress generated by bending the display. These dimensions have been corroborated by two reputable sources. According to one rumor, the inner folding display will be approximately the size of a piece of A6 paper and will use a 2,713 x 1,920 resolution, while the outer display will use a 2,088 x 1,422 resolution.
Chassis and Hinge
Durable Materials
The foldable iPhone reportedly has a titanium chassis, with the hinge constructed from a combination of titanium and stainless steel, according to Kuo. Apple is said to be using liquid metal in the hinges to improve durability and help eliminate screen creasing. Liquid metal, manufactured using a die-casting process, has been chosen by Apple to address these two common issues with foldable devices, according to the analyst. The frame itself will use a titanium alloy to prevent bending issues – a solution that has worked well for Apple's new ultra-thin iPhone Air. However, analyst Jeff Pu believes that Apple is using aluminum and titanium, whereas Kuo believes a mix of stainless steel and titanium has been chosen. 
Cameras
Front and Rear
The foldable iPhone is expected to include a dual-lens rear camera, with a front-facing camera for both folded and unfolded states, according to Kuo. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman recently corroborated reports that the device will have four cameras consisting of one front camera, one inner camera, and two rear cameras. Prolific Weibo-based leaker Digital Chat Station claims that the rear dual lenses will be 48 megapixels each. Other sources have claimed that the inner display features an under-screen camera (USC), while the outer display – in the device's folded state – will have a punch-hole camera.
Authentication
Touch ID
Kuo believes the phone will forgo Face ID authentication, and instead use a Touch ID side button as a means to save precious internal space, and Bloomberg's Mark Gurman recently corroborated the rumor. Apple has previously integrated Touch ID into the side button of the iPad, iPad Air, and iPad mini.
Cellular Connectivity
C2 Modem
The foldable iPhone will use Apple's second-generation C2 modem for cellular connectivity, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. Apple debuted its custom-designed C1 modem in the iPhone 16e earlier this year, followed by the C1X featured in the iPhone Air, as part of a multi-year plan to transition away from Qualcomm modems. Gurman says the foldable device will not have a physical SIM slot.
Battery Life
High-Density Cells
Apple is putting a heavy focus on improving power efficiency by slimming down key components like the display driver to make room for more battery cells, according to a Korean blog that has leaked accurate details about unreleased products before. The phone will reportedly use high-density battery cells. Expect the C2 modem to be faster overall, and for it to gain mmWave support in the United States. Further power efficiency improvements are likely too.
Color Options
Black and White
Apple is currently only testing variations of black and white for the folding phone with suppliers, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, although he says that Apple's plans could evolve before the device launches.
Pricing
Premium Segment
Multiple reports have suggested the foldable iPhone will be priced between $2,000 and $2,500 in the United States, which could make it the most expensive iPhone ever. Meanwhile, analysts at investment banking firm UBS believe the phone will be between $1,800 and $2,000. However, Kuo recently claimed that the hinge is expected to carry an average selling price (ASP) of approximately $70 to $80 when mass production begins – well below the market expectation of $100 to $120 or higher. Kuo attributed the cost decline to ""assembly design optimization"" and Foxconn's influence in production scaling. Whether the reduction in hinge price will reduce retail price or simply bolster Apple's margins is an open question. Regardless of the price, the foldable is expected to tap into Apple's loyal fanbase, some of whom will view it as a ""must-have device"" if its quality meets expectations.
Launch Date
Late 2026
According to industry analyst Jeff Pu, the device entered the New Product Introduction (NPI) phase at Foxconn in March. Foxconn is expected to officially start producing Apple's foldable iPhone  early in the fourth quarter (October), and a recent report has suggested Apple is already stockpiling components for pre-production. An exact launch date is currently unknown, but both Kuo and Pu say mass production is planned for the second half of 2026. Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman has said he expects the device to be launched next year in the fall season. However, Japan's Mizuho Securities banking firm has suggested a postponement to 2027 could still happen because of Apple taking longer to decide on key design elements such as the hinge.

Foldables remain the ultimate test of smartphone engineering. These smartphones redefine design, usability, and performance in a single form factor.
With expansive inner displays and pocketable outer screens, they promise the best of both worlds — productivity and portability.
Every brand sees foldables as a chance to innovate, but for Google, which controls Android itself, it is an opportunity that carries even greater weight.
The Pixel 10 Pro Fold feels like a cautious update rather than a smartphone trying to make a statement.
 But let's be real, the latest Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold doesn't quite rise to the challenge.
While it corrects some of the original Pixel Fold's mistakes, it still feels like a cautious update rather than a smartphone trying to make a statement or move the needle much further ahead.
And compared to global competition that's delivering thinner builds, bigger batteries, faster charging, and truly flagship-level cameras, Google's foldable just doesn't match up. It's not just restrained, it's lagging far behind.
To Google's credit, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is its most refined foldable yet. But that in itself doesn't say much.
Yes, the outer display finally feels usable. It's wide enough to type and scroll comfortably without forcing you to open the device every single time. Similarly, the hinge is smoother and less fragile.
Moreover, the addition of an IP68 water and dust resistance is a genuine engineering milestone for a foldable device.
The inner display has also evolved. You'll find slimmer bezels, higher brightness levels, and a generally better touch response, all of which contribute to making a solid everyday screen for reading, watching movies, social media, and multitasking.
More so, coupled with Android's maturing large-screen experience, the device finally feels functional instead of an evolving experiment.
Performance also looks better on paper.
The new Tensor G5 chipset brings with it improved efficiency, smoother multitasking, and a strong dose of AI smarts. Sure, the Tenso G5 isn't about to top benchmark charts, but it's good enough for day-to-day use.
Combined with the bright screens, sturdy hinge mechanism, and class-leading water resistance, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold feels like a complete flagship. But complete isn't the same as competitive. And that is a widening gap.
 The biggest issue with the Pixel 10 Pro Fold isn't what it does right. It's about what it doesn't. This device is meant to lead Android's foldable evolution, but just like Google's conventional flagship, it continues to play it safe.
Performance is the obvious first weak link. Google's Tensor lineup has never been about raw speed, and while its AI smarts are commendable, that doesn't excuse the gap in sustained performance, heat management, or, for that matter, battery life.
For a phone that costs nearly $1800, it's a gap that shouldn't exist, and users shouldn't have to settle for something that is good enough.
For a phone that costs nearly $1,800, users shouldn't have to settle for something that is good enough.
 Battery life continues to stay middling.
Competing foldables offer larger and larger batteries, while Google's pedestrian for 2025 standards battery and slow charging make long days of multitasking and content consumption feel risky.
It perpetually feels like you're not going to get through the day, which isn't the experience you should feel.
Then there's the camera system.
Pixel hardware built its reputation on photography excellence, but the foldable lineup feels like a compromise at the very least.
Instead of matching the Pixel 10 Pro's best sensors, Google relies on older hardware. Even when boosted by computational tricks, there's only so much that a dated sensor can pull off.
The results are fine, reasonably good in daylight, but certainly not flagship-level.
Meanwhile, the ultrawide and telephoto shots are downright disappointing, and don't get me started on the hardware's limitations that show up in low-light conditions.
It's clear that Google's strategy leans too heavily on software magic. But foldables don't need just clever algorithms; they need top-tier optics and hardware to back them up.
While Google keeps trudging along at its own pace, other brands are showing what true foldable ambition looks like.
There's the obvious Samsung competition, but look at what's happening with Chinese foldable smartphones, and you get an idea of what is capable today.
For example, the Vivo X Fold 5 packs a 6000mAh battery, charges faster both wired and wirelessly, and manages to be both thinner and lighter than the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold.
The outer display is a full-fledged flagship screen. The hinge is smooth, the crease is borderline invisible, and the build is every bit as premium as you'd want from a top-tier flagship.
It's impossible to justify Google's conservative approach when the rest of the market has leaped ahead.
 All that is great, but the biggest difference lies in imaging and photography capabilities.
The smartphone packs a triple 50MP setup across wide, ultrawide, and telephoto lenses, delivering real flagship results.
The consistency across lenses and lighting conditions, and images that can keep up with the best of standard flagships, proves that foldables no longer have to compromise.
With the right hardware in place, these foldables can help you get proper reach, low noise levels, strong dynamic range, and excellent low-light photography without relying on post-processing magic.
Vivo isn't alone in this. Major brands like Honor, Huawei, Xiaomi, and Oppo have all proven that foldables can deliver class-leading performance, slim construction, and top-tier cameras that can match up with the best smartphones.
All that makes the Pixel 10 Pro's limitations stand out even more. It's impossible to justify Google's conservative approach when the rest of the market has leaped ahead.
Let me be clear. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold isn't a bad phone at all. It's just not setting any benchmarks.
The 10 Pro Fold is a foldable design for Pixel loyalists or those obsessed with the software experience over everything else.
But that's not what the foldable category should be about. And especially when it comes to Google's foldables.
These phones are supposed to showcase the absolute best that a company can deliver, both in hardware and software.
They're meant to be a showcase of what the brand is capable of, and right now, Google's foldable tells a story of a company holding back.
But here's the deal: Google can no longer afford to treat the foldable category as an experiment or a demonstration tool for Android's software capabilities.
For it to succeed and thrive as a viable contender for one of the best foldable smartphones on the market, Google must build a foldable that competes head-on with the very best in the world in terms of hardware, imaging, and design.
The next Pixel Fold can't just be content with catching up, it needs to set a benchmark for what an Android foldable can be.
 The next Pixel Fold can't just be content with catching up; it needs to set a benchmark for what an Android foldable can be.
And that means designing a phone without compromises, not one that hides them behind AI enhancements, many of which are barely more than interesting experiments.
And above all, it means expanding the vision beyond what's available in the US market, because foldables are thriving globally, and Google's limited feature set is a significant detriment in making these the aspirational products the category represents.
The competition is already proving that foldables don't have to mean compromise. It's high time that Google stopped playing it safe and built a foldable designed for the future.
The Pixel 10 Pro Fold offers Gemini AI features and can withstand an impressive 10 years of screen folding. This smartphone is an investment that'll last for years to come.

Families in the U.S. and around the world are having fewer children as people make profoundly different decisions about their lives. NPR's series Population Shift: How Smaller Families Are Changing the World explores the causes and implications of this trend.
At an indoor play center in Cheyenne, Wyo., a sea of toddlers throw around colorful blocks and balls. Grace Moreno, who is 21, is there with her 11-month-old son, who is dressed in pajamas with little firetrucks on them.
""It's the only free place, so it's worth it,"" she said.
Finances are tight for Moreno and her husband. They moved to Wyoming from Texas, while pregnant, so her husband could work a higher-paying electrician job. But now that they are parents, paychecks seem to disappear.
""Our rent in Texas was like $800,"" Moreno said. ""Here, it's like $1,775.""
Rent is their biggest cost. They spend $300 a week on groceries and $100 on formula. The couple also have car payments, and they're paying bills for their son's delivery.
""I remember sitting there looking at a stack of mail, probably like maybe 3 inches tall … hospital bills, ER bills,"" Moreno recalled.  ""And I looked at my husband. I was like, 'I don't ever want to do this again.'""
Months earlier, she thought she'd have multiple kids. But just six weeks after giving birth, Moreno decided to have her tubes tied.
""I was kind of like, 'Oh my gosh, my mom was right. This is too expensive.'""
Having only one kid means Moreno's family can save a couple of hundred dollars a month for a mortgage, so their son can someday have a backyard.
""Not only are homes more expensive, but then add, you know, a 7% [mortgage interest] rate on top of that,"" said Emily Harris, senior demographer at the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute at the University of Utah.
She said the rate at which women are having babies in Wyoming is just above the national average but still too low to replace the state's population. The same is true for all other states in the Mountain West, which have seen some of the largest drops in fertility rates nationwide in the past two decades.
Meanwhile, the region's population is still growing. A lot of people are moving here to escape bigger cities and for an outdoor lifestyle, which is driving up home costs.
Harris said things like child care costs and generational values also play into people's childbearing decisions and that they're definitely changing.
""We have this idea of, like, the nuclear family,"" Harris said. ""You need to get married, and then you buy a home and then you have children …  and really over the last decade or two, that kind of timeline has been halted and kind of rearranged.""
Some states are passing laws aimed at easing housing costs for young families. But not Wyoming.
""The biggest barrier to addressing this housing crisis is really convincing my colleagues that the government has a role to play,"" said state Rep. Trey Sherwood, a member of the Democratic minority.
Progressives have pushed for a state fund to help build more affordable housing. But members of the Republican supermajority, like Sen. Bob Ide, say the government should stay out of it.
""Fiddling with housing, you know, it gums up the wheels of the free market,"" Ide said.

                Sean Thornton and Reesie Lane sit under a tree with their dogs.

He pointed to laws the Wyoming Legislature passed to restrict abortion access, allow nannies to care for more children and ease property taxes as examples of family-friendly policies.
But Wyoming couples like Reesie Lane and Sean Thornton say it's still just too expensive to have kids now.
""Sean and I started dating and he said, 'I don't know, I think I want to have like six or seven kids,'"" Lane said, as Thornton laughed.
""[But] as we went through more and more financial struggles I guess, eventually it came to like, 'Yeah, I think we can have like one or two,'"" she added.
Lane and Thornton both work in the state university system. They spent their 20s struggling to pay rent in tiny apartments, and then around age 30, they finally bought a house.
""I think that's when we started to realize it might be too late,"" said Lane, who also has an ovarian syndrome that makes it hard to conceive. "" I'm not sure that we're going to be able to have children.""
Lane said it's heartbreaking to not have enough money to give even one kid a full life, but that it's also freeing.
For now, they're content with their fur babies, a Pomeranian and a shih tzu mix that were dressed in matching bandanas with fall leaves.
""They're a hundred percent little babies,"" Lane said, holding up the well-dressed pups, Huckleberry and Finn. ""They're so spoiled.""

The good news: You didn't get laid off. The bad? You might be cut next month.
Some large employers are now embracing recurring job cuts rather than axing a bunch of workers all at once. That can help companies avoid cutting too deeply and minimize disruption.
Yet drawn-out cuts can prolong workers' unease, pulverize morale, and make it harder for leaders to rally teams to move in a new direction.
Companies, including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, have recently made cuts in stages.
Amazon, which this week said it was laying off 14,000 employees, expects that in 2026 it will uncover ""additional places we can remove layers,"" and ""realize efficiency gains.""
Paramount, following its August merger with David Ellison's production company, Skydance, said this week it would cut about 1,000 employees. That's only about half of the expected reductions, a source familiar with the company's plans previously told Business Insider.
Translation: More cuts are likely.
Amazon declined to comment, and Paramount Skydance didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.
""We're seeing a lot more of this drip-drip, which does cause uncertainty,"" Carly Holm, founder and CEO of the consulting firm Humani HR, told Business Insider. ""It's not ideal.""
Layoffs have, in some cases, become a form of corporate preening — a way to demonstrate that those in charge are avoiding bloated org charts or feeble business lines, especially after turbo-charged hiring during the pandemic in industries like tech.
Companies have also simply grown accustomed to routinely shedding workers, said Matthew Bidwell, a management professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.
""They may not have quite the same sense of, 'Gosh, this is bad, so let's just do it once and do it big,'"" he told Business Insider.
And with the job market cooling, Bidwell said, bosses don't have to worry as much that workers who remain will feel free to walk away.
Many CEOs' thinking about layoffs has shifted over the decades, he said. Prior to around 1980, Bidwell said, employers tended to furlough workers, such as those in factories, when demand slipped, with the intention of hiring them back once things picked up. Layoffs, particularly among white-collar employees, were seen as a last resort, Bidwell said.
""The big change today is, 'If we think it might raise profits, we're going to do it,'"" he said.
Brooks Holtom, a professor of management at Georgetown University, said that researchers have found that layoffs can decrease creativity among workers who remain, and increase their stress and rates of burnout.
That's why, he told Business Insider in an email, it would be ""much better"" to make one-time cuts rather than spreading them out.
Another reason employers might prefer one big swing: People start leaving after layoffs. Research has shown that the share of workers who quit tends to increase by about 50% in the year following a layoff — and often the best performers are among them because they have options.
While it can be disruptive to workers, it's easy to see why CEOs might not want to swing the axe all at once. If they overshoot, they risk having to hire again, and few things signal instability like a whiplash hiring spree.
Getting the cuts over with might help morale and trust bounce back sooner, yet the approach also brings risks, said Sarah Rodehorst, cofounder and CEO of Onwards HR, which helps large companies stay compliant with regulations when laying off employees.
In a moment when everything from AI to tariffs to government spending cuts is making decision-making difficult, there's a danger in cutting too quickly. What a business needs today could look very different six months from now, Rodehorst said. Plus, slashing too many people at once can make it harder to reassign work and rewire the organization's operations.
""The business may need people for a period of time as part of that restructure,"" she said. ""So, it's hard to let everyone go all at once.""
The risk, of course, is that the people left behind spend more time wondering if they're next rather than focusing on their jobs.
Much as CEOs overseeing the cuts might wish it, the period after layoffs isn't exactly ""innovation and growing-the-business time,"" said Scott Kirsner, CEO of InnoLead, a research firm focused on corporate innovation. Instead, he said, teams tend to be busy figuring out who's managing whom and what the company even looks like now.
Bidwell, from Wharton, said that big cuts often create ""huge turmoil"" and that trying to avoid layoffs for several years can require leaders to make big predictions about what a business will need in the future.
Even so, he said, the idea that businesses can simply cut and rehire as needed overlooks the hidden drags — things like damaged morale, lost institutional knowledge, and the time it takes new workers to get up to speed.
""There are serious adjustment costs every time you bring new people in,"" Bidwell said.
Besides, he said, while it's easy to tally up the salaries of laid-off workers, ""it's a lot harder to assess the challenges that you're going to face in continuing to motivate your people and getting the work done.""

When you open a new business, you don't just sit back and hope that people will show up.
You advertise. You post on social media, tell your friends and neighbors, and do all that you can to promote your product to gain and retain customers.
There's no reason the public school system shouldn't be doing the same, Brian Stephens, the CEO of Caissa Public Strategy — a strategic communications firm — told Business Insider.
""Allow everyone to compete,"" Stephens said. ""If they don't compete and they don't present their best foot forward, they're going to go out of business. And I think that's devastating for society.""
Some public schools facing declining enrollment hire Stephens' firm to help them recruit new students. The firm calls parents, sends out mailers, creates digital advertisements, and sends ground crews to knock on parents' doors and promote their local public school.
He even uses a ""secret shopping"" strategy, where he'll send staffers who pretend to be parents to schools to better learn what parents see when they visit.
""It takes as many as 21 contacts to explain to a parent all their choices and then ultimately hope that they pick the right choice for their family,"" Stephens said. ""Maybe it's a public school, maybe it's not, but the choice is shown.""
Business Insider is exploring how America's public schools are fighting an enrollment decline due to the school choice movement, declining birth rates, funding challenges, and more. Share your story with this reporter at asheffey@businessinsider.com.
While Stephens said his firm has helped boost enrollment at many of the schools he works with, it's not enough to reverse the larger declining enrollment trend nationwide. The National Center for Education Statistics projected that public school enrollment in the US will fall by 7.6%, or nearly 4 million students, by 2031 due to declining birth rates and growth in the school voucher movement. Some districts have had to shut down schools as a result, and uncertainty with federal funding is an added strain.
Business Insider spoke with teachers and administrators in Broward County, Florida — a county that has faced steep enrollment declines — to learn how schools are fighting to keep their doors open. The efforts include parent tours, showcases, innovative marketing, and more.
""I was the one doing every school tour, all 60 of them,"" Stephanie Saban, the principal at Coral Cove Academy of the Arts, told Business Insider. ""We held two showcases in the neighborhood, and we invited a lot of the community out to see our performances.""
If private schools and charter schools can call parents and market what they offer, public schools should be doing the same, Stephens said.
""If you believe in school choice but you don't want public schools to compete, then you don't really believe in school choice,"" Stephens said.
Gastride Harrigan, the principal at Millennium 6-12 Collegiate Academy in Broward County, knows that marketing is a crucial element of his job.
He said that a big ""selling point"" for parents is that the school offers students the opportunity to graduate with both an associate degree and a high school diploma, and he makes sure to promote that whenever he can.
""Competition is fierce, and it's constant showcasing the program,"" Harrigan told Business Insider. He said that he focuses on building relationships with the feeder elementary school, which means going to their meetings and events and ""making sure parents understand who we are, what we offer.""
He added that it's not just speaking about the programs Millennium offers — it's including students in the conversation.
""If you hear from the kids who go through the program, whether in middle or high, then I think it's a better selling point than me trying to tell you the benefits of them,"" Harrigan said.
On December 9, Broward County Public Schools is holding a showcase to advertise opportunities at schools county-wide. The flyer for the showcase said that families will learn more about the county's K-12 magnet programs, ""innovative"" curriculum offerings, and ""unique programs tailored to student success.""
Northeast High School's principal, Anthony Valachovic, embraces this strategy. His school promotes its ACEs program, which allows students to pursue an educational pathway tailored to aviation, technology, or the arts. The school's magnet coordinator goes to showcases, local sports games, and other community events to get the word out. It's working: on the 10th day of the current academic year, Northeast enrolled 1,822 students, compared to 1,689 at the same time last year.
""It boils down to finding programs that match the students' interests and really tailoring what you're doing to your actual school population,"" Valochovic said.
Schools can't control some of the factors contributing to tanking enrollment, like declining birth rates. But they can control their messaging, and Stephens said now is a critical time for them to shape their own narrative.
""Public schools are getting more and more in the game every day,"" Stephens said. ""I think that's a good sign, and could be awesome for us as a nation.""

87,2025-10-31,"The world's two largest economies appeared to dial back a monthslong trade war.
A short-term agreement struck between the U.S. and China early Thursday appeared to dial back a monthslong trade war between the world’s two largest economies, carrying implications for everyone from smartphone buyers to soybean farmers.
The deal came after a high-stakes meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, the first in-person gathering of the two leaders since Trump took office for his second term.
Some trade experts who spoke with ABC News indicated both sides had won notable concessions, though the ultimate impact may depend on whether the agreement can withstand mercurial US-China relations.
Trump said Thursday the 20% tariffs on China related to fentanyl were being reduced to 10%, bringing the total effective tax rate on Chinese imports from 57% to 47%.
The one-year agreement also addresses other issues, such as U.S. access to critical rare earth minerals and the Chinese soybean market, Trump said. The fate of social media platform TikTok remains unclear after the deal, but a thaw in tensions could influence a potential sale, some experts said.
“This is progress,” Kaiser Kuo, the host of ""Sinica Podcast,"" a U.S.-based podcast on current affairs in China, told ABC News. “Whether it will endure is yet to be seen.”
Rare earth minerals
Beijing said it would delay imposing dramatic restrictions on rare earth minerals -- key materials for the production of computer chips necessary for goods ranging from smartphones to AI to defense technology.
China's Ministry of Commerce confirmed the temporary suspension of those restrictions in an official readout. Trump said he believes the one-year deal will be ""routinely"" extended.
China dominates global production of rare earths, accounting for roughly 60% of rare earth mining and about 90% of processing capacity, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
If China had moved forward with the threatened restrictions, the policy would have hamstrung U.S. production in key sectors, Dennis Wilder, a professor at Georgetown University and former official on the White House’s National Security Council, told ABC News.
“The Chinese backdown here is real,” Wilders added, but he cautioned that yet-to-be-seen details of the commitment would determine whether U.S. access to rare earth minerals ends up fully restored.
“The U.S. is highly dependent and will be for a number of years still,” Wilders said, estimating that it would take between 5 and 10 years for the U.S. to establish a domestic supply of rare earth minerals.
Soybean farmers
Trump also said Xi had ""authorized China to begin the purchase of massive amounts of Soybeans, Sorghum, and other Farm products.""
On Thursday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business that China had agreed to buy 12 million metric tons of soybeans from U.S. farmers this year, as well as at least 25 million metric tons over each of the next three years. Such volume would return Chinese soybean purchases to annual levels recorded prior to recent trade tensions.
Trump had previously drawn criticism from some U.S. soybean farmers who have suffered losses amid the U.S.-China trade war.
Joe Janzen, a professor at the University of Illinois and its FarmDoc project, said the agreement could ease a major fear among U.S. soybean farmers about a continued loss of Chinese purchases and the drop in soybean prices that would have ensued.
“The concern has been about expectations of the future and how things could get worse,” Janzen said. “This agreement realizes what some people in the trade were thinking: There’s got to be a resolution to this conflict that means we shouldn’t see dramatically lower prices for soybeans.”
But, Janzen cautioned: “The market still has to process to what degree it thinks this is really binding in the medium and long run.” He noted China’s failure to fulfill the terms of a commitment on soybean purchases hatched out in a “phase one” trade deal reached during Trump’s first term.
TikTok
Last month, Trump announced an agreement that would pave the way for social media giant TikTok to come under the control of a group of U.S. investors.
Ahead of the meeting on Wednesday, China had not provided public approval of the deal, leaving the fate of a potential U.S.-based TikTok uncertain. China continued to withhold its approval after the summit, saying only that it would collaborate with the U.S. to “properly address” the topic.
Still, Bessent told Fox News on Thursday that China had “finalized” its approval in recent days.
“I would expect that would go forward in the coming weeks and months, and we'll finally see a resolution to that,"" Bessent added.
The potential end to the standoff comes 10 months after a ban on the China-based app was set to take effect in January. Instead, Trump delayed the ban multiple times, while assuring app stores and server companies that they would not face penalties in the meantime.
Alan Rozenshtein, a law professor at the University of Minnesota who has closely tracked the TikTok ban, said he would await a firm, detailed agreement before weighing in on whether TikTok had complied with the divestiture required to lift the ban.
“It’s been so chaotic that until there's a signed piece of paper, somewhere I’ll wait to have an opinion,” Rozenshtein said.
Scrutiny has centered on the fate of TikTok's algorithm, a proprietary formula that fuels the attention-grabbing social media platform. U.S. critics have raised concern about potential Chinese manipulation of the content feed if the algorithm remains under the ownership of a China-based company.
Wilder, of Georgetown, said the algorithm may be a sticking point in the TikTok sale, since the Chinese view the algorithm as valuable intellectual property while some U.S. officials consider it a critical part of any agreement.
“It seems to me that one side will have to give on this issue and so far neither side has shown a willingness to do that,” Wilder said.

        Chromium Browser DoS Attack via document.title Exploitation

There was an error while loading. Please reload this page.

Brash is a critical vulnerability in Blink, the rendering engine that powers Google's Chromium-based browsers. It allows any Chromium browser to collapse in 15-60 seconds by exploiting an architectural flaw in how certain DOM operations are managed.
The attack vector originates from the complete absence of rate limiting on document.title API updates. This allows injecting millions of DOM mutations per second, and during this injection attempt, it saturates the main thread, disrupting the event loop and causing the interface to collapse. The impact is significant, it consumes high CPU resources, degrades overall system performance, and can halt or slow down other processes running simultaneously. By affecting Chromium browsers on desktop, Android, and embedded environments, this vulnerability exposes over 3 billion people on the internet to system-level denial of service.
STATUS: Operational
AFFECTED VERSIONS: Chromium ≤ 143.0.7483.0 (tested: 138.0.7204.251, 141.0.7390.108, 143.0.7483.0)
Note
The exploit is currently operational. Once the vulnerability is patched, this code will cease to work. Regardless, discovering this architectural flaw and completing the entire research, documentation, and design process to share something impactful with the world has been an incredibly rewarding journey.
11 major browsers were tested on macOS, Windows, and Linux to validate the vulnerability's impact.
All Chromium-based browsers are vulnerable because the flaw exists in the core of the Blink rendering engine:
Brash exploits a fundamental architectural flaw in the Blink rendering engine: the absence of throttling on document.title updates. The attack operates in three critical phases:
Generates 100 unique hexadecimal strings of 512 characters and stores them in memory before starting the attack.
Why pre-load them instead of generating them in real-time?
Because constantly generating new strings consumes CPU time on mathematical operations. That time is critical—every millisecond spent generating strings is time NOT used to bombard the browser with document.title updates.
By having 100 strings already loaded in memory:
As a result, we achieve maximum injection speed with maximum memory consumption per update.
Executes configurable bursts of title updates. With default configuration (burst: 8000, interval: 1ms), it attempts to inject approximately 24 million updates per second, and it's during this attempt that the browser collapse begins.
Continuous updates saturate the browser's main thread, preventing the processing of other events:
Collapse timeline:
Why does it work?
Blink processes each document.title change synchronously on the main thread without rate limiting. This creates a bottleneck that:
To fully understand the impact of Brash, you can experience the exploit in different contexts, from a controlled live demo to your own implementation. Each option is designed for different levels of interaction and technical understanding.

To see the exploit without a graphical interface, visit https://brash.run/hidden-live-demo.html. This version executes the injection invisibly, simulating a real attack.
If you prefer to run the demo in your own environment, the exploit-demo/ directory included in the repository allows you to:
Simply open exploit-demo/index.html in any Chromium browser and configure the burst and interval values before starting.
To integrate Brash into your own security testing or research, include the script and configure the attack:

API Usage:
Intensity configurations:
Note: Each burst executes 3 sequential document.title updates. For example, burstSize: 400 = 1,200 actual updates per interval.
Brash can be weaponized in multiple critical contexts with consequences ranging from economic losses to human life risk.
A critical feature that amplifies Brash's danger is its ability to be programmed to execute at specific moments. An attacker can inject the code with a temporal trigger, remaining dormant until a predetermined exact time.
Technical implementation:
Parameters:
Why the delay parameter is especially lethal:
Doesn't require knowing when they'll open the link: Simply waits X seconds from when the victim opens the page.
Time to establish trust: During the waiting minutes, the victim interacts with seemingly legitimate content (forms, documents, videos).
Evades initial inspection: If someone quickly reviews the code, it appears inactive. The attack doesn't execute until later.
Perfect psychological timing: Waits until the victim is deeply involved in the task (middle of exam, middle of meeting, during critical procedure).
Typical scenario with delay:
Why the scheduled parameter is also devastating:
Surgical synchronization: The attacker chooses the exact moment of maximum impact (market opening, peak operations time).
Global coordinated attacks: Multiple targets can be hit simultaneously in the same second.
Evades prior detection: The malicious code can be present days or weeks beforehand without executing, passing security reviews.
Impossible to stop: By the time the attack executes, it's too late to prevent it.
Strategic timing examples:
This kinetic timing capability transforms Brash from a disruption tool into a temporal precision weapon, where the attacker controls not only the ""what"" and ""where,"" but also the ""when"" with millisecond accuracy.
Scenario: Enterprise systems that depend on AI agents for web scraping, market analysis, competitor monitoring, or customer support automation use headless browsers (Chromium/Puppeteer) to query thousands of websites daily. An attacker injects Brash into popular sites that these agents query.
During critical automated operations:
Amplified attack vectors:
Real impact: Paralysis of critical automated operations, economic losses from unmade decisions, massive degradation of AI-dependent services, infrastructure recovery costs, exposure of critical dependency on automated agents.
Scenario: A cardiovascular surgeon is performing a coronary bypass operation assisted by a web-based surgical navigation system (increasingly common in minimally invasive surgeries). The system provides real-time images, patient vital metrics, and guidance for robotic instruments.
During the most critical phase of the operation, a browser notification appears: ""ALERT: Critical surgical system update - Apply now or the operation may fail.""
Upon clicking in panic:
Real impact: Direct risk of patient death, potential for permanent damage, psychological trauma to the medical team, million-dollar lawsuits for technological negligence.
Scenario: During Wall Street market opening, a malicious actor injects Brash into multiple channels simultaneously: Bloomberg Terminal web interface, institutional trader chat, and specialized forums. The link promises ""Leak: Fed emergency meeting transcript - Rate cut confirmed.""
In the first 30 seconds of trading (maximum liquidity):
Real impact: Trillions of dollars in market capitalization losses, global financial panic, SEC investigations, potential confidence crisis in markets.
Scenario: Fraud analysts at a bank process suspicious transaction alerts in real-time through a web dashboard. During Black Friday (transaction peak), they receive Brash via corporate email: ""New fraud pattern detected - urgent analysis required.""
At the moment of highest transactional volume:
Real impact: Millions of dollars in direct losses, thousands of customers with fraudulent charges, massive reputational damage, regulatory fines for prevention system failures.
These scenarios are not theoretical. The simplicity of Brash makes it a real threat to any operation that depends on web browsers, which in 2025 means practically everything.
The creation of Brash is an effort to demonstrate what happens when basic protections are absent in the web technologies we use daily. The vulnerability doesn't lie in complex code or advanced techniques, but in the fundamental lack of rate limiting on an API that should be throttled by design.
The impact of Brash on over 3 billion Chromium browser users demonstrates that architectural flaws in core components like Blink have massive and global consequences. This is not an isolated bug—it's a design flaw that affects the entire Chromium ecosystem.

90,2025-10-31,"The thrilling World Series shows that baseball is truly back—just in time for its next crisis.
Sportswriters have been penning baseball’s obituary for decades, claiming that America’s pastime is past its time. The game is too slow, too stodgy, too old, too boring, they said. The kids don’t care.
But baseball is not dying. It’s thriving.
A thrilling World Series, set to resume tonight with Game 6 in Toronto, will bring to a conclusion another blockbuster Major League Baseball season. The Blue Jays are one victory away from their first title in 32 years but must win against the game’s best team and best player. A couple weeks ago, the Dodgers’ Shohei Ohtani delivered arguably the single greatest individual performance in the 122 years of the World Series era by hitting three home runs and pitching six shutout innings. And then, 10 days later, he nearly outdid himself by reaching base nine times in one game.
The rule changes implemented three years ago have all worked—most notably the pitch clock, which has cut the average game length down from 3 hours and 10 minutes in 2021 to 2 hours and 38 minutes this past year. Fans have responded to the quicker pace of play; attendance has surged, growing for the third straight year to an all-time high of 71.4 million. TV ratings are up again (more than 32 million people globally watched Game 1 of the World Series). Record revenues are flowing into the coffers of Major League Baseball. And after years of worry about the game’s graying audience, the fan base is getting younger. Ohtani is the biggest star, but Aaron Judge, Mookie Betts, and Bryce Harper have all broken through. Juan Soto signed the biggest contract in American sports. And, hey, even my Red Sox finally made the playoffs again.
But there is danger on the horizon: Those who are in charge of the game could be on the verge of delivering it a blow from which it may not soon, if ever, fully recover. The league’s collective-bargaining agreement runs out after next season, and nearly everyone in or around the game is bracing for a work stoppage. At the current trajectory, most believe that there will be either a lockout or strike extending long enough to force the cancellation of games. And if much, or all, of the season is lost, then baseball runs the risk of squandering its new momentum. At a time of economic strain, it will ask its fans to pick sides in a battle pitting millionaires against billionaires. It could lose an audience that has never had more alternate options for its ever-shrinking attention span. The goodwill—and new fans—that baseball has so recently gained could be lost.
Don’t do this.
Baseball has been here before. A 1994 strike led to the cancellation of the last 50 games of the regular season and did what no world war had done: called off the World Series. Tony Gwynn was denied a shot at hitting .400; the Montreal Expos lost their best chance at a title and soon found themselves searching for a new home. Furious fans stayed away. It took years for the game to recover, helped along by a string of feel-good stories: Cal Ripken broke Lou Gehrig’s consecutive-games streak, the Yankees [sigh] got good again, and, most important, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa’s home-run chase captivated the nation. In the new century, two of baseball’s signature franchises—the Boston Red Sox and the Chicago Cubs—ended decades-long championship droughts. MLB prospered, even as it remained defined by local allegiances. (Unlike many NFL fans, who obsess about the entire league—in part thanks to the rise of fantasy football and gambling—a healthy percentage of baseball fans really follow only their own team closely.)
Now, not all the news was good: That 1998 home-run chase and the exploits of some of the game’s biggest stars—Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens, Alex Rodriguez—were reported to have been chemically aided. And though the game was still financially flush, concerns were growing. It was too slow; there wasn’t enough action. Too many strikeouts, not enough offense. The league was struggling to draw new fans. And perhaps most of all, the games were simply too long. The sport that prided itself on not having a clock suddenly needed one.
Those of you who love four- or five-hour games won’t find an ally here (and not just because I have to wake up early). Of course, I fondly remember the five-hour Games 4 and 5 of the 2004 ALCS. But that was in October against the Yankees; we don’t need marathons in May against the Orioles. A series of rule changes were implemented after the 2022 season—bases got bigger; bullpen usage was tightened; defensive shifts were eliminated—in order to promote more action and speed things up. Most important, a pitch clock was introduced. Traditionalists were horrified. They got over it quickly. The game exploded in popularity again. And, of course, it didn’t hurt that perhaps the greatest player to ever play the game was entering his prime.
It’d be silly to write about baseball in the year 2025 and not spend one more moment on Ohtani. Fans have run out of superlatives with which to describe his brilliance, how he gets us to expect the impossible, how he routinely makes us turn to one another slack-jawed while gasping, “Did you just see that?”
One of the persistent knocks against MLB was that it didn’t know how to create or market stars. After David Ortiz and Derek Jeter hung up their cleats, MLB didn’t have an obvious face of the league. Big names in other sports, such as the NBA’s Steph Curry and the NFL’s Patrick Mahomes, gobbled up the endorsements and starred in viral TV ads. Baseball was sluggish in embracing social media, and its dusty unwritten rules frowned on displays of exuberance and showmanship even as young sports fans across the country thrilled to swaggering touchdown dances and flashy three-pointers. Baseball’s consensus best player, Mike Trout, was quiet and unassuming, and seemed content to ply his craft in obscurity on sub-.500 teams in suburban Orange County, California. Ohtani, as hard it is to remember now, was there, too, playing the first six years of his career down the street from Disneyland while becoming the first credible two-way player since a guy named Babe Ruth. But once Ohtani moved up the I-5 to Dodger Stadium, he became the best baseball player in history and the game’s biggest star in decades.
But all that goodwill could vanish after next season. Negotiations over the current collective-bargaining agreement endangered the 2021 season until, with just weeks to go before Opening Day, the rank-and-file players overruled the MLB Players Association’s executive committee and accepted the league’s offer (the season started a little late, but no games were lost). The ink was still drying on that deal when both sides circled the 2026–27 offseason as the moment to fully wage war, particularly over one key issue: a salary cap.
A yawning chasm separates the payrolls of the league’s top-spending teams from those of its lowest. For example: The New York Mets’ payroll was $323 million this season while the Dodgers spent $321 million, and the Yankees, $293 million. On the other end of the spectrum stand the Miami Marlins at $67 million, the Sacramento (for now) Athletics at $73 million, and the Tampa Bay Rays at $79 million. The massive payroll disparity comes, in part, because MLB is the only major American professional-sports league without a salary cap. The players’ union has made it clear that they won’t accept that. (Harper yelled at MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred when he brought it up in a recent clubhouse visit.) They believe that a cap is just a way for rich owners to direct more of the $12 billion industry’s money away from players. Many players—and fans—point the finger squarely at the small-market owners who cry poverty and don’t spend, accusing them of caring more about franchise valuations than about keeping their stars and fielding a winner. Sell the team, they say, if you don’t want to do enough to compete.
The league, meanwhile, believes that the current system of luxury-tax penalties for big-spending teams isn’t enough and that a cap is necessary to level the playing field. It points to polling that says fans are on board and acknowledges that a salary floor would come along with it; in other words, if the Dodgers are forced to keep their spending below a certain threshold, then a team such as the Pittsburgh Pirates would be forced to spend at least a league-mandated minimum. It’s true that despite the monetary discrepancies, there is some parity: Baseball hasn’t had a repeat champion since 2000, and in the past 11 years, there have been 10 different title winners. But, the league argues, the last bottom-15 market team to win a World Series was the Kansas City Royals, in 2015, and year after year, it’s predominantly big-market teams that are playing at the end of October with a chance to win a title.
With both sides dug in, formal negotiations aren’t slated to begin until next spring. Most people around the game believe that, unless something changes, games will be lost in 2027—maybe half a season’s worth or more.
The kids care. Mine certainly do, anyway. My two sons (ages 14 and 10) play travel baseball and follow MLB religiously. They have their own fantasy teams. Our long car rides are spent discussing possible offseason trades. They talk trash with their friends. Their biggest wardrobe decision when getting dressed in the morning is choosing between Roman Anthony jerseys (including for school-picture day). They hate all things pinstriped (can’t imagine where they got that from).
Baseball is passed down within families. Your allegiance is in your bloodline. The love of the game was passed from my grandfather to my father to me and my brother, and now to my sons. Back in 2020, the sports leagues were debating how to restart during the deadliest year of the coronavirus pandemic. America was desperate for a distraction, some sort of sign that life could be normal again. The owners and players fought then, too, and baseball was the last major sport to figure out a way to come back. Had they failed, they would have rightly earned their fans’ fury. At the time, I remember agonizing over how I’d tell my young sons that their favorite sport wouldn’t be played.
My kids are older now. And they’ll play baseball in 2027 even if I have to tell them that major-league stadiums will stay dark. But I still dread it.
Don’t do it, baseball.

92,2025-10-31,"People walk along muddied roads scavenging the wreckage for food. Others jump into damaged stores in the hope of finding bottled water or other supplies. 
As the death toll rises, residents of Black River are still searching for loved ones while they also battle to survive, days after Hurricane Melissa made this Jamaican port city ground zero of the devastation seen across the Caribbean. 
Residents here say they have been living in a state of chaos the last three days since Melissa slammed into them as one of the most powerful category 5 storms ever recorded in the region.
The fierce winds and storm surge that barrelled through here have decimated nearly everything, leaving roads unusable and a trail of destruction that has them increasingly desperate and isolated with no electricity or running water.
Capsized boats lie curb side. Brick buildings are split in half. Giant sheets of metal are twisted between tree branches. Vehicles sit in crumbled pieces. 
Residents who spoke to the BBC said they have seen no aid trucks in the area so far and described having to eat what food they can find in debris by the roads in the coastal town, nearly 150 km (93 miles) west of Kingston. 
Others made their way inside battered supermarkets, taking what they could for themselves. Some, who climbed on top of one partially destroyed market, tossed food and bottles of water down below, where people gathered with arms outstretched.
""We have to use whatever we see here, on the street and also in the supermarket,"" Demar Walker explained, sitting in a shaded area down the street from the store to escape the heat and 80% humidity.
He said he and others had to climb into the market due to its roof caving in and the took what they could. They tossed water and items to others also in need.
""We didn't be selfish, we had to throw food to other people,"" he said.
Nearby, others told the BBC of a local pharmacy being looted in Black River, describing anarchy as people ran in and out carrying armfuls of drugs and alcohol.
""I saw items covered in mud being hauled out,"" Aldwayne Tomlinson told the BBC. ""At first, I thought the place was still open, but then I really got a second glance.
""I heard a lady say, 'Mi need go get some alcohol.' That's when I knew they were looting the pharmacy as well,"" he said.
Just down the road, a woman standing atop a pile of debris describes the situation there as ""chaos, chaos. Total. No food. No water"".
""We don't have access to money. We need help. No help has come,"" Chegun Braham continues.
One couple told the BBC that they owned multiple stores in the area, several of which they said had been looted. They are now standing guard outside one of their stores in the hope of preventing future thefts. 
A short walk from the market, Jimmy Esson leaned against a massive metal beam that had been knocked to the ground.
""I lost everything, all my things,"" he said. ""We need food. We have no food.""
Survival is the primary concern on most people's minds here. The other is the rising death toll. Officials in Jamaica said on Thursday that at least 19 people had died in the country, a big jump from the five that had been counted the day before. Another 30 have died in neighbouring Haiti due to the storm.
""My community, we have dead bodies there,"" Mr Walker said.
He said he, like many others in the area, still has not heard from family and doesn't know if they made it out of the storm alive. Mr Walker is stuck in Black River, sleeping in whoever's house is still standing that will accept him, he says, while his eight-year-old son is in Westmoreland, the next parish over.
Westmoreland shares Jamaica's western coast, along with Black River in the St Elizabeth parish, and was also severely damaged by Melissa.
""There's no way of getting to my family to find out if they're OK,"" he said as his eyes began to swell. Along with the unusable roads making travel difficult, there is little to no cell phone service and no electricity or running water in many hard-hit spots.
""The entire town of Black River is devastated,"" the town's mayor Richard Solomon has said. 
He noted to local media about the desperation of residents who are looting and - while not condoning it - said he understands why it is happening.
""It is a delicate balance,"" Mayor Solomon said of the response to it. ""Persons are seizing the opportunity to pick up what they can off the ground (from damaged stores). However, you have others being a little bit more forceful, where they are trying to get into people's properties to get all sorts of supplies.""
Local officials estimate that 90% of the houses here were destroyed. Much of the town's vital infrastructure has been destroyed too, including the local hospital, police station and fire station.
""There are entire communities that seem to be marooned and areas that seem to be flattened,"" Information Minister Dana Morris Dixon said.
Aid supplies are starting to arrive more rapidly to the main airport in the Jamaican capital, Kingston, but smaller regional airports, some of which are located near where humanitarian assistance is most needed, remain only partly operational.
Aid agencies and the military are bringing in the urgently needed supplies from Kingston by land but many roads remain unpassable in places, including in places like Black River.
The town is about a two-hour drive from Kingston but the main road in is - at various points - flooded, damaged and clogged with cars.
Michael Tharkurdeen, a local medic, was in the town's fire station when the storm hit.
""We were upstairs, the entire bottom floor was flooded. The water was around maybe four feet going five feet. When the water came in, the seas came in, flooded everywhere,"" Mr Tharkurdeen said.
""Nobody could be on the bottom floor. Trust me, there were waves there about this high,"" he says, pointing to his shoulder.
People that did make it to him from the flooded-out buildings nearby arrived in bad condition. They had ""lacerations on their hands, their feet,"" he says. ""Kids, elders, everybody.""
Mr Tharkurdee also found a man ""lifeless"" and with ""no pulse"" once the flood waters receded.
""I'm not a doctor, I'm a medic, so I couldn't pronounce him dead,"" he said. ""All we could have done was document that and cover his body.""
By mid-afternoon on Friday, a fleet of military helicopters flew into Black River - with many hoping they came with desperately needed supplies.
Armed officials carrying machine guns descended onto the streets and soon the crowds rummaging the looted pharmacy and grocery store had cleared. A line of cars that had jammed the sole road in the area had been cleared.
A relative quiet replaced the noise and chaos of hundreds of people fighting for their survival.
""St Elizabeth, we want it to come back again,"" Shawn Morris said of the area's future and his hopes to get aid here.
""It's not about the money,"" he said. ""We need food and water.""

Earnings week for the Mag 7 brought mixed results and sharp stock moves. Apple rose more than 3 percent after reporting $102.47 billion revenue and $1.85 EPS, driven by iPhone and Services. Alphabet logged its first $100 billion quarter, up 16 percent year over year, on strong search and cloud performance. Microsoft posted $77.7 billion revenue and $3.72 EPS but fell on concerns about AI infrastructure spending. Meta set a record $51.24 billion revenue, then dropped 10 percent after a $15.9 billion tax charge and rising Reality Labs capex. Oracle stayed elevated as cloud sales climbed 28 percent in September. Nvidia reached a $5 trillion valuation on relentless AI chip demand, announced seven U.S. supercomputers, invested $1 billion in Nokia, and confirmed plans for up to $100 billion in OpenAI. CEO Jensen Huang forecast $500 billion in AI chip sales as investors treated Nvidia as the core of global AI infrastructure. Shares rose 5.6% to $212.19 after reports that President Trump will discuss Nvidia’s Blackwell chips with China’s Xi Jinping. CEO Jensen Huang projected $500 billion in AI chip sales and announced seven new U.S. supercomputers. Nvidia also invested $1 billion in Nokia to develop AI-native 5G and 6G networks. Its stock is up 50% this year. Nvidia plans to invest $100 billion in OpenAI, cementing its dominance as AI infrastructure demand outpaces supply.
Sesame, the smart-glasses startup led by former Oculus co-founders Brendan Iribe and Nate Mitchell, raised $250 million in Series B funding. Sequoia Capital and Spark Capital led the round bringing total funding to about $300 million. The company is developing lightweight AI-powered glasses equipped with voice assistants named Miles and Maya to create an “ambient interface” that understands context and environment. Sesame’s blend of spatial computing and conversational AI positions it as a competitor to Apple, Meta, and Google-backed Magic Leap in the race to define the next generation of AI wearables. For Iribe, who previously founded Scaleform (acquired by Autodesk) and co-founded Oculus (acquired by Facebook for $2 billion), Sesame marks his fourth major venture.
White-collar layoffs are accelerating as AI adoption reshapes office work. Last week we reported Amazon is cutting 14,000 corporate jobs. This is the tip of the AI iceberg looming before the labor market. UPS has trimmed 14,000 managers over two years, and Target plans 1,800 more cuts. JPMorgan, Walmart, Accenture and others have revealed plans to slow hiring. All cited AI. PwC, the accounting and consulting giant, cut staff globally, partly because of AI. Nestlé cut jobs, blaming automation.GM to Booz Allen are reducing staff, citing efficiency and automation. Nearly two million Americans have been unemployed for six months or longer, while demand for trade, healthcare, and construction workers rises. Recruiters report middle-aged professionals struggling to keep up with new technologies and entry-level hiring tightening. Economists warn that AI-driven restructuring is eroding white-collar stability even as overall productivity improves.The irony is that the companies downsizing will yield huge dividends from Wall Street, which as far as I can tell, has never met a reorg it does not like (remember Meta’s “year of efficiency”?) 
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced plans to create an autonomous “AI researcher” by 2028, with an intern-level assistant expected by 2026. The company is restructuring as a public benefit corporation, allowing large-scale investment while its nonprofit foundation retains 26% ownership. Chief Scientist Jakub Pachocki said models could surpass human intelligence within a decade through greater “test time compute” and algorithmic advances. OpenAI plans to dedicate entire data centers to major research problems, investing $1.4 trillion to build 30 gigawatts of infrastructure. The foundation will allocate $25 billion for disease research and oversee safety and governance.
Magic Leap and Google have partnered to build reference hardware for the Android XR ecosystem. At the Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh, they revealed a prototype that merges Magic Leap’s waveguide optics with Google’s Raxium microLED engine, a key technology for lightweight AR glasses. The three-year deal positions Magic Leap as an optics and display supplier rather than a consumer brand, with Google focusing on the software layer. The prototype underscores Google’s return to spatial computing and its strategy to seed Android-based AR hardware through partners instead of producing its own glasses.
VRChat has launched on Android and iOS, opening the social VR platform to millions of mobile users. The iOS app supports devices running iOS 17 or newer, while Android requires version 10 and at least 6 GB RAM. Phones with less memory can use a limited “Companion” mode. The mobile rollout ends the platform’s beta phase and extends its reach beyond PC and VR headsets, potentially driving major user growth. VRChat recently hit 54,000 concurrent users on PC, its highest count in years, and expects a significant surge as mobile players join its creator-driven virtual worlds. Meta Horizon is approaching mobile XR the same way. Rec Room tried this, but all it did was add users and UGC spam, not revenue, and was partially responsible for layoffs there. 
This column has a companion, The AI/XR Podcast, hosted by its author, Charlie Fink, and Ted Schilowitz, former studio executive and futurist for Paramount and Fox, and Rony Abovitz, founder of Magic Leap.

The U.S. housing market is currently in a paradoxical state. On one hand, there’s a significant demand backlog driven by millions of Americans in need of homes and decades of underbuilding. On the other hand, the usual mechanisms that convert this demand into actual home closings are stalled. Home sales are currently the lowest they’ve been in over 30 years! Mortgage rates have yet to come down meaningfully for it to make sense for homeowners to truly consider a move and the construction labor market has seen better days as it grapples with a low supply of workers and a surge in input costs. The affordability of the white picket fence is increasingly being criticized by young professionals, meaning the rental market is not just for Americans on the move. For prospective homebuyers, homebuilders, and investors this creates a landscape that appears ripe with opportunity but demands caution in practice. 
Mortgage rates remain one of the most pivotal factors in housing affordability. Following the ultra-low rates of the post-pandemic era, the market has shifted to higher levels, though they've eased slightly recently. According to Freddie Mac data, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate stood at 6.27% as of mid-October 2025. 
A decade of near-zero interest rates after the Great Financial Crisis had allowed developers and investors to leverage extensively for favorable cap rates. Nonetheless, new starts didn’t necessarily surge relative to the broader reappearance in aggregate demand. More regulatory hurdles and financial constraints also made it hard for homebuilders to take advantage of the near zero rates. 
Fast forward a few years and interest rates again throw a wrench in the system; after low Covid era interest rates initially stoked demand, the rapid rate hikes in 2022 crushed affordability and created a lot of grid lock in the housing system. Newly high rates discouraged sellers from listing their homes as a comparable refinance rate was so much higher. So housing supply dropped. At the same time, higher rates have made purchasing a house more expensive - so demand is down too. 
The recent decline in rates should be supportive for the housing market, at least on the surface. This is visible with builder sentiment rising to its highest level in six months. Yet, the degree to which rates have dropped may not be substantial enough. Many homeowners secured sub-4% rates during the pandemic and are reluctant to move and refinance just because of an extra 25 basis point reduction in mortgage rates. 
Absent sellers coming into the market and new supply coming online, lowering rates could just serve to push home prices even higher as buyers potentially come back into the market. Moreover, affordability must be viewed holistically: while current rates aren't historically extreme, persistent inflation is curbing discretionary spending, making mortgage payments more burdensome for American consumers. 
The homebuilding industry faces persistent structural challenges that hinder supply growth. Top of mind currently is a shortage of skilled construction labor. A joint study by the Home Builders Institute (HBI) and the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) estimates that this labor shortage cost the single-family sector over $8 billion in lost production in 2024 alone, while delaying construction times by an average of almost 2 months. Even more notably is that immigrant labor constitutes a significant portion of the construction workforce. Large-scale deportations can exacerbate already existing shortages, leading to sharp increases in labor costs. Removing thousands of workers can slow construction projects and reduce output by millions of jobs - affecting both immigrants and U.S.-born workers while driving up home prices.  
Additionally, land use regulations continue to make homebuilding more burdensome. And this isn’t a national problem – it’s a local problem which makes it even harder to address at scale. This is likely not talked about enough – when we struggle to create new homes for people to live in, an entire generation of workers can become priced out of new job opportunities and innovation can stall. Ample housing is necessary to enable relocation in our country and eliminate frictions for our workforce to move about freely.
 However, this is easier said than done. NIMBY (“Not In My Backyard”) forces actively resist efforts to make housing more affordable, driven by one fundamental motivation: scarcity. Homeowners know that the value of their property depends largely on the supply of homes in their neighborhood. While zoning reform sounds promising, it is a complex challenge that is likely to persist for many years.
And we can’t forget about inflation. Homebuilders face rising input costs like lumber, concrete, and steel, and it doesn’t help that the current administration has placed tariffs on goods coming from our next-door neighbors like Canada and Mexico. The vast majority of U.S. lumber imports come from Canada, while Mexico is a leading exporter of lime and gypsum products used in drywall manufacturing. Homebuyers, on the other hand, have to deal with soaring homeowners' insurance premiums, which have surged nearly 70% since 2019. These rising insurance costs inflate total housing carrying expenses, erode affordability, and can even depress home values in disaster-prone areas like Florida and California.  
The overall impact: even as mortgage rates dip, other under-the-radar costs continue to rise, tightening buyer budgets. Combined with homebuilders' input and labor cost burdens, potential homebuyers are in a tough spot right now. 
Baby boomers dominate the housing market, owning approximately 40% of residential real estate. As a result, the U.S. housing stock is now skewed toward larger homes – a result of homebuilders catering to older folks upgrading houses throughout their life. Today, however, demand has shifted toward smaller starter homes like 2-bed/2-bath units favored by Gen Z renters transitioning to ownership. This mismatch is extremely important because it tests the theory that houses will become more affordable once baby boomer’s pass their homes off to the next generation of buyers – what if nobody wants those homes? This is where renovation will have to come into play to address the wrong kind of supply coming to market. The retail giants like Home Depot (HD) and Lowe’s (LOW) will continue to enable renovations and additions like smart home technology, insulation upgrades and kitchen tear downs and are poised to maintain their stronghold on the home improvement market. 
Worth considering is that baby boomers’ grip on supply in the U.S. will be compounded by advances in medical tech and AI-assisted home systems. The availability of human capital to serve this generation will also be critical. Staffing firms providing in-home skilled nursing, paired with AI, are likely to make staying in your home as you age more practical. This is paired with the fact that nursing home costs are becoming increasingly unaffordable – abundant demand for rooms paired with lack of supply is making access to high quality nursing homes expensive. Enabling our country’s senior citizens to “age-in-place” is a huge market for Big Tech firms like Apple (AAPL) – wearable tech and assistive access within their iOS has only served to make their lives easier and has plenty of runway to continue to scale.
With homeownership increasingly unattainable for younger generations, renting has become the new norm. The old school American dream of buying a house after graduating college and starting a job is increasingly out of reach for younger workers. Delaying the first home purchase until after age 30 is not at all uncommon – meaning the renters market is more important than ever. When interest, taxes, insurance, and maintenance are all taken into account, owning is generally more expensive and time consuming than renting. Additionally, the opportunity cost from putting a down payment on a house can’t be ignored. For generations prioritizing their time and spending more on experiences, the homeownership lifestyle is becoming more out of style.
This trend benefits consumer discretionary firms tailoring products to renters. Interior design services offering non-permanent customizations are in high demand. Stocks poised to benefit include furniture and home goods retailers like Wayfair (W), which offers affordable décor for temporary lifestyles. Additionally, rent-to-own specialists like Upbound Group (UPBD) could see upside as budget-conscious renters furnish without large upfront costs. These companies capitalize on renters' habits of prioritizing flexible, value-driven purchases over permanent investments.
Another point of contention with the renting vs. owning debate has been private equity behemoths becoming more involved in the residential market. Wall Street buying up Main Street has been criticized extensively by Capitol Hill, but the share of single-family homes owned by companies like Blackstone (BX) is still relatively small. And while many might point to Wall Street as the main culprit for making suburban homes unaffordable, there are real benefits to offering homes for rent v. purchase. Enabling lower income families to rent in the suburbs gives their children better access to high quality schools and quality of life – key factors in determining future financial health and college graduation rates. 
Structurally, the U.S. housing market is undersupplied, and demographics point to long-term tailwinds for the sector. But higher borrowing costs, ownership burdens, and industry bottlenecks paint a cautious picture for prospective homebuyers. Investment potential endures, but it will demand discipline: the current landscape does not lend itself to the traditional path of becoming a homeowner anymore. Until supply sorts itself out, look for opportunities within America’s renting cohort and enabling technology. The story of housing being unaffordable in America did not happen overnight, and it will probably take years to fix. "

Arc Raiders came out yesterday, and as such hordes of players have been jumping in and discovering the mysteries of this new extraction shooter. However, it turns out something truly special has been uncovered by Topside raiders: the literal power of friendship.
You see, Arc Raiders is a high-stakes game in which dying up on the surface will result in the loss of most of your inventory. As such, players have been busting out the emote wheel and microphone to talk down other raiders. There's nothing stopping you from extracting from a match together, after all. Why shoot someone if you don't need to?
These collaborators have been heading online and spreading the word on how nice people tend to be in Arc Raiders, such as music streamer asymmetricalsoul who managed to strike up a whole conversation with half a dozen solo players without a single hostile shot fired. Players have reported apologising for shooting at someone actually works, as does asking to team up for quests out in the harsher environments of Arc Raiders.
In my own experience playing Arc Raiders… yeah people seem to be incredibly kind for the most part. I was looting the hospital in Buried City and found three other players hanging around just chatting. During the preview period, I was able to bust out the flute and play a little song for a squad of enemy players without losing my head. So if you're in need of a reminder that human kindness does exist, strangely enough Arc Raiders may be a good place to find it.
If you're looking to learn more about Arc Raiders, why not read a recent interview with Embark Studios CCO about the game's use of AI, including the justifications for doing so and the studios' approach to the technology.

Clair Obscur: Expedition 33Game AwardsHollow Knight: SilksongPolymarket 
Polymarket has opened up betting on The Game Awards 2025 and no one seems to have a doubt that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 will take top honors at Geoff Keighley’s showcase. The odds are so stacked in the French RPG’s favor that a $100 bet on Hollow Knight: Silksong would net you over $1,000 if it actually ended up winning game of the year instead.
Gambling on the 2025 GOTY race opened up on Polymarket on October 29, well in advance of anyone actually voting on what game will actually win has even begun. The Best Game category is decided by media ballots (90 percent) and fan voting (10 percent) with the winner revealed during the live show on December 11.
Nominees are chosen in November followed by a final round of voting. While it’s Keighley’s show, he doesn’t participate in any part of the selection process. Also, full disclosure, Kotaku has never participated in voting and nothing in this article should be mistaken for financial advice (that’s a thing you’re supposed to write, right?)
With all of those wrinkles in mind, the first 48 hours of the GOTY race on Polymarket were interesting to witness. While Clair Obscur is currently leading with bets suggesting an 80 percent chance of winning, it didn’t start out that way. It was actually Silksong who was the frontrunner in the initial hour after the market opened. Whoever was betting first must have been all in on the Metroidvania hype.
But it didn’t take long for the pack of frontrunners, which also included Death Stranding 2 and Hades 2, to fall way behind Sandfall Interactive’s surprise turn-based hit. All of those other games are not currently trending in the single-digits. Silksong is second with 8 percent, Hades 2 is third with 5 percent, and Death Stranding only has 3 percent. Over $75,000 has been wagered so far.
From there Split Fiction, The Oute Worlds 2, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, Donkey Kong Bananza, Elden Ring: Nightreign, and Blue Prince all have at least a percentage point. Ghost of Yotei and every other game that came out this year, on the other hand, are all at decimal points. Shockingly, there is over $900 of betting volume on Grand Theft Auto 6, a game which is not coming out this year. I guess someone didn’t get the memo.
What can we make of all this? Remember, prediction markets aren’t an indication of what will happen, they’re a measure of what peopleÂ think might happen. The complete domination of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 could mean that lots of people played it and think it’s great, or it could just mean people who like placing wagers on Polymarket are seeing how jazzed everyone else is about the game and trying to refine that online noise into quantifiable signals.
Polygon‘s Oli Welsh, who maintains a rolling list of GOTY frontrunners based on a mix of experience, vibes, and data, has had Clair Obscur in the lead for a while. Maybe Polymarket users are taking their cues from him! One of the only variations from the current betting landscape is that he has Yotei in closer contention, even if it’s still an outside shot. If you look at Metacritic, however, Hades 2 technically has a higher composite review score from all of the aggregated critics. Those are the people who do most of the voting, after all.
The actual mechanics of how various outlets vote, from magazines like Game Informer to YouTube groups like Easy Allies, probably play an even bigger role in deciding the outcome than ambient industry vibes. Some ballots are decided on purely by the head of those outlets. Others do informal internal voting. Some might make choices based on what theyÂ think is supposed to be the right answer, just like the Polymarket folks are doing. Others might decide based purely on what the most people at that outlet played and liked. Often passion carries the day. Five people really liking game X might not carry the day against three who think Y is the most important game of the decade.
Will that messy, inconsistent process yield Clair Obscur as the winner this year? The users on Polymarket clearly think so. We won’t know until the paper envelope is opened on stage by the makers of last year’s winner, Astro Bot.
