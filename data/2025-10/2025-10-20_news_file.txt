0,2025-10-20,"Apple's stock price reached a new all-time high today, with shares in the company trading for as much as $264.38 on the intraday market, according to Yahoo Finance.
The company's previous intraday high was $260.10, set on December 26, 2024.
Keep in mind that Apple's stock has split five times since the company went public, including on a 4-for-1 basis in 2020 most recently.
The new record comes after some Wall Street analysts and reports said there has been strong demand for Apple's new iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max models, although the iPhone Air is reportedly less of a hit overall, despite a hot start in China.
Apple achieved the record high despite continuing to lag behind companies like OpenAI and Google in the generative artificial intelligence space. Over the weekend, it was reported that some of Apple's software engineers have ""concerns"" about how well the more personalized version of Siri works on an internal iOS 26.4 beta for the iPhone.
Apple's next quarterly earnings report will be released on October 30.

Everyone criticises ""policy"" when it bites them in the ass, not one femtosecond before.Capitalism's biggest achievement - (sheer number of) fools that believe in it.

You and every Cyberpunk author ever.
Where do your referees come from? Are they like Philosopher-Kings, i.e. nice in theory but not in practice?
Sorry, but capitalism has LOS of good points.  It's just that it also has more than a few really bad points.  Small scale capitalism is extremely good.  Monopoly ANYTHING tends to be really bad.
OTOH, some jobs cannot be done without concentrated controlled power.  Whether you call the agency that does them a government or a corporation is basically irrelevant, what *is* relevant is the damage they do in the process of doing those jobs.
Small scale capitalism, where there's no significant ""barrier to entry"" i 
And what is your alternative to Capitalism?In my opinion, every economic system is flawed because they all have to deal with human nature, which is more complex and shifty than will fit into any neat little economic model.
Winston Churchill is supposed to have said that Democracy is a terrible form of government; it's just better than all the others.  That's how I feel about Capitalism.
Sometimes I compare Capitalism to fire.  It's great for some things, but it's also dangerous and has to be watched and monit 
What happens to capitalism's efficiency if prices are noise (cf. another comment characterizing Nvidia's prices as ""bogus"")?
The US: ""You arent buying enough from us! You need to buy more from us!""
Also the US: ""You cant buy basically anything that you actually need, we forbid it - buy more cheap bulk goods that you can get from anywhere rather than the technology goods you actually want perhaps?""
And our social media ""achievements"" which you definitely don't need or want
Ahh no, services and software are not included in the trade deficit calculations for some reason...
So the fact that the world uses American cloud services, financial services and other things - yeah, not important, and you should definitely ignore the fact that those things alone flip deficits on their heads for most countries.
Pizza!
The prices are bogus and set by a company with margins that are practically unheard of. Thus far, the lion's share of value with ""AI"" is going to Nvidia and it's investors. They require an additional license to use their hardware with hypervisors which is additionally predatory - it's akin to charging someone a license for using an AMD cpu or Intel CPU, direct from AMD or Intel, and if you don't pay you can't run a VM or a container.
It makes sense to nationalize GPU production and to ban this one company fr 
They can't get their own designs manufactured on EUV either, so they won't be catching up fast.
They cant get their own designs manufactured on EUV machines built by a Dutch company, due to export restrictions placed on those machines by the US...
Which just means that China will develop its own independent capability.
And yes, that might take 10-20 years, but to China thats not a long time, thats just the time it takes - while other countries think about timescales in 5-10 year spurts, China has plans set out 50 years ahead.  And China accepts that things take time.
So it really depends on what you mean 
What China? The Confucian China? The cultural revolution China? The liberalised then overran by tank China? The disillusioned ultracapitalist China ran by a dictator who concentrated power in a way Mao could only dream off, who now has grandiose dreams of immortality because he can see no China beyond himself?
50 year plans my ass.
And that attitude is why you are going to lose.
10-20 years is a long time in semiconductor process technology years whether China knows it or not.

Just like producing Blackwell-level GPUs in 10-20 years is questionably useful.  Now, if the claim is that the effort to copy those technologies allows China to eventually catch up to producing the same ASML and Nvidia products at the same time that ASML and Nvidia produce their products, then that's something.

It's bizarre that people think China can't rapidly catch up with anything the West does that they consider of strategic importance when half the engineers going through Western colleges these days are Chinese and they're actually going into engineering rather than finance, advertising or some other parasitic endeavour that produces nothing of real value here in the West.

Yes, ""in five years China will be shipping cheap AI chips all over the world"", but they'll only be ""good enough"", not ""top of the line"".  That'll probably take 10 years.
Well, 10 years still isn't a long time.  It will only matter to them if, say, an AGI breakthrough happens before 2030 and still depends on transformer chips.  (I've got a theory that the ""transformer chips"" direction is the wrong direction...well, not *wrong* exactly, but misleading.  I think AGI is going to be more dependent on multiple sma

I had no idea that stupid and self-harming economic policies could be so cleverly and thoroughly executed.  My hats off to the Orange Turd.
I'm just kidding.  One only needs to look to the 1920s to see similar idiocy.  The Atlantic has an article about it today: https://www.theatlantic.com/bo... [theatlantic.com]
If you can't deal with the paywall, go to archive.is.
I think it's more of a military policy than an economic policy. The parasitic elite want war with China so they can loot all its stuff, and see this as a way to improve the odds.
Only Normies care about The Economy these days. Everyone else is focused elsewhere.
Come on, no idea?  And cleverly executed?  Even a blind squirrel finds an occasional nut.  And it's lies anyway, you think China isn't getting Nvidia hardware?
Yeah, China is currently getting Nvidia hardware, but it's acting strenuously to wean itself from it.  Wherever local stuff is ""good enough"", then that's what it pushes.  And it's pushing development so that local stuff is less limited.  I expect this to take them a decade to reach parity, but I've no inside or detailed information.   (I'm repeating projections made by someone else.)
The Trump Administration blocked additional chip sales in April and later granted export licenses for certain Nvidia and AMD chips in exchange for 15% of revenues. 
Seems like something the Mob would do.

I think you're beginning to understand taxes now. Good job.
And yes. Just like the mob.
Let's work on abolished the IRS before caring about whether the top shareholders are making enough millions off of sales to China or not.
My taxes pay for all manner of government services which I use and take advantage of.
Where does this %15 go?
""I think you're beginning to understand taxes now. Good job.""
But you are not.
No.
Let's abolish listening to clowns who think all taxation is theft, they only want to burn everything down instead of fixing it because they are weak minded and lazy.
What if you just print money instead of taxing, and index incomes to price rises so everyone's real purchasing power is kept stable?
Quit selling dual-use technology to a nation that wants to destroy us with it, Huang. It's pretty simple.
Your quarterly earnings won't matter if the West Coast takes AI-coordinated cruise missile strikes from the Chinese Navy.
The 21st century is working out to be a Chinese Century. With much of the economic development controlled directly or indirectly by China.America's dominance they enjoyed through most of the 20th century is likely over, in much the same way the British Empire will never be near its 19th century peak.
The American people are going to find out the hard way that their country is in decline. And refusing to take steps to control the outflow of wealth is going severely degrade the quality of life for the working class in the US. By the time voters figure it out, it will be too late. the heist will have long been completed.
It's not an outflow of wealth, it's an upflow of wealth.  Wealth is not a zero sum game, wealth is generated.  China may generate a lot but it doesn't have to take it from the US to do so.  The problem in the US is the billionaire class, not China.
""By the time voters figure it out, it will be too late. ""
By the time you figure it out...
There it is.
Your general conclusion is correct, but your analysis is wrong.Wealth isn't a simple concept.  It has no direct relationship to anything physical, but it's got a LOT of indirect relationships.
E.g. part of wealth is being healthy.  This depends on physical things, but for most of them there are tradeoffs.  Potatoes aren't necessary if you've got wheat or oats.  Clean air is valuable, but so is treatment for diseases.  And NONE of these things are directly proportional to money.
E.g., part of wealth is having 
...from obtaining tech is futile and counterproductive.Chinese scientists and engineers are smart. Look at most recent papers published and you will see a LOT of Chinese names.Chinese scientists and engineers are also good at working around obstacles.I expect China to become the world leader in tech.There was once a time when the best and brightest from all over the world came to the US. Those days are over.
The projections I've seen put China's semiconductor industry a equal to the best in the west sometime after 2030, probably around 2035.  This is a spur to convince them to move it closer to 2030, but some of the techniques are pretty sensitive, so I'm not sure it will work.
""...and called it a mistake not to have them build AI on American technology.""
Why?  In what way does ""America"" lose out because of this alleged mistake?  nVidia may lose out, but not the US.  Does not affect me in the slightest.
If US companies lose a market, less money flows into the US.  Theoretically that should disadvantage the citizens of the US, but that's based on the assumption that the wealth is shared, even though not equally.  A somewhat dubious proposition.

7,2025-10-20,"Appleâs stock price just reached an all-time high, currently sitting around $263 per share and rising. Here are the details.
Apple reports its next quarterly earnings next week, when weâll get the first official word on iPhone 17 sales.
But in the meantime, third-party reports keep indicating the latest iPhone lineup is proving a big hit for Apple.
Counterpoint Researchâs report is the latest sign of strong sales, and the recent iPhone Air launch in China seems to be going extremely well too. 
These reports no doubt were influences in Loop Capitalâs decision today to upgrade its recommendation for AAPL from âHoldâ to âBuy.â 
Via CNBC:
âWhile [Wall] Street is baking in some degree of outperformance from AAPLâs iPhone 17 family of products, we believe there remains material upside to Street expectations through CY2027,â Loop Capitalâs Ananda Baruah said in a note to clients on Monday.
All of this helps explain why Appleâs stock has been surging today.
Currently, AAPL stock is hovering around $263. Itâs expected to continue fluctuating throughout the day.
The previous high at closing was from last December, when the stock hit $258.10.
Overall, the broader stock market seems to be having a strong day. Per CNBC this is likely due to expectations of the US government shutdown ending very soon.
Even though AI is clearly a big driver of Wall Street activity, it seems any concerns around Appleâs ability to ship an upgraded Siri arenât creating real hesitation with investors as of yet. Strong iPhone sales are hard to argue with.
What do you think of Appleâs recent stock success, and do you expect it to continue? Why or why not? Let us know in the comments.

Your beloved older laptopâs biggest problem might not be that balky spacebar youâve already replaced twice, or the big scratch on the lid. If itâs been sort of gasping and wheezing along, it could just be an issue of storage, or lack thereof. An overstuffed hard drive in a PC laptop or desktop is an unhappy hard drive, and an unhappy hard drive can bring everything to a screeching halt.
You could replace the whole thing, obviously, or you could give the old fella a new lease on life for as little as $55 by hitting Amazon for their deals on the Samsung 870 EVO 2.5-inch SSDs, ranging in size from 500GB all the way up to a monstrous 4TB. Itâs like a brain transplant, but far less expensive, and with no bonesaws needed.
See at Amazon
Weâve established that replacing an older, smaller internal SSD with a Samsung 870 EVO doesnât require a pile of money, but it also doesnât require a mastery of IT skills. Once you back up your old drive to a reliable external storage device, swapping it out for the Samsung 870 EVO is a fast, easy procedure. Restore your files to the new drive, and the difference in performance will be immediately obvious. Thatâs due in part to the vastly superior speed of the 870 EVO Ã¢ÂÂ sequential speeds of up to 560/530 MB/s.
Unlike your old drive, the 870 EVO is up to the heaviest of tasks, including 8K video processing, and itâs built with durability and length of life in mind Ã¢ÂÂ the 4TB model is guaranteed by Samsung for up to 2,400 TBW (terabytes written). And, while it is absolutely recommended that you do a little research beforehand to ensure the Samsung 870 EVO is compatible with your laptop or desktop PC, itâs been compatibility-tested for a massive array of host systems and applications, including chipsets, motherboards, NAS, and video recording devices.
Samsung has been renowned for so many high-quality tech products over the years, from TVs to smartphones, home appliances to tablets, laptops to wireless earbuds, itâs easy to overlook the fact that Samsung has also been the worldâs leading brand for flash memory for over two decades, all the way back to 2003. Whether youâre opting for the 500GB model of the 870 EVO for just $55, going all the way up to the 4TB for $260, or somewhere in between, youâre getting an internal drive from the worldâs leading brand.
The current Amazon deal is for the 500GB model of the Samsung 870 EVO Ã¢ÂÂ itâs 27% off right now, bringing its price down from $75 to $55. The 1TB ($95), 2TB ($180), and 4TB ($260) models are currently listed at full price. But even if youâre looking to replace a 500GB hard drive, the Amazon deal for just $55 delivers a far faster, more advanced drive than your current one.

The S&P 500 fell 2.7% this past Friday, ending a 33-day streak without a 1% move and highlighting renewed market volatility.

There are times buying in bulk is a super smart move, and then there are times when you wonder if filling your basement with 600 buckets of survivalist food was really worth the money. This Amazon deal, thankfully, is one of the super smart moves, since itâs offering you a 4-pack of Apple AirTags for just $65, just half a buck more than the all-time low price for a 4-pack. The math says that nets out to $16.25 per tracker tag, while the price of an individual AirTag at Amazon is $25 even while itâs also on sale.
Considering just how many uses there are for AirTags, buying just one would be a little odd to begin with. Even if you travel with just one carry-on bag, your backpack, purse, or wallet would benefit from an AirTag as well. And there are so many third-party AirTag holders available now that you can track anything from your car keys to your cat. (No, really,ÃÂ your cat.) Finding uses for four AirTags is a cinch.
See at Amazon
If youâre an iPhone or iPad user, you absolutely cannot beat the AirTag for keeping track of your stuff. With one-tap setup, the AirTag goes from unboxing to fully running and linked to as many as five users in minutes. The disc shape and compact size mean you can put it basically anywhere, either with one of those specially designed keychains, wallets, or other holders, or just loose if youâre placing it in a suitcase or backpack.
When itâs time to call upon the AirTag to locate a lost item, it gets the job done whether the missing object is wedged between the couch cushions mere inches away from you, or if itâs thousands of miles away. In close range, you can use the Find My app to have the tag play a sound for you to locate, or use the app to lead you to the AirTag with accurate measurements down to the foot. At long range, the millions-strong Find My network can locate your AirTag and show its current location, even if itâs on the other side of the world.
Not only is the ability to quickly locate a missing item a good safety feature, thereâs also the fact that even the Find My network is deployed to help find your missing item, itâs done with complete anonymity. The whole network is encrypted for privacy, and the AirTags themselves never store location data or history.
This Amazon deal on a 4-pack of Apple AirTags for just $65 comes at a great time, probably just as youâre thinking about or actively planning your holiday travel. Itâs a great price and a small investment for the ability to track not only your own stuff, but also to help keep tabs on the familyâs bags as you brave the holiday crowds.

Cathie Wood is betting that Elon Musk's new $1 trillion Tesla pay package will comfortably clear its first hurdle: a shareholder vote.
In a post on X on Sunday night, the ARK Invest founder and longtime Tesla bull said she expects Musk's compensation plan to win ""decisively,"" despite opposition from influential proxy advisory firms and index funds that she said dominate institutional investing.
""When shareholders first voted on Elon Musk's 2018 pay package, Tesla was not in any index, and the pay package won decisively,"" Wood wrote.
""Now Tesla is 2.4% of the S&P 500, not enough for index funds to swing the vote, and I believe that Elon's new package will win decisively.""
Tesla's new compensation proposal, set for a shareholder vote on November 6, would be the largest in corporate history.
The deal would award Musk up to $1 trillion in stock if he meets performance targets â including pushing Tesla's market value to $8.5 trillion and meeting 12 ""operational milestones.""
Those range from selling 12 million cars and one million humanoid robots to launching a million robotaxis and boosting adjusted earnings from $16.6 billion in 2024 to $400 billion.
The company's board has warned that if shareholders reject the deal, Musk could reduce his involvement or even walk away entirely.
Still, the proposal has sparked criticism from proxy advisory firms like Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), which urged investors to vote against it, citing its enormous scale and saying it has a lack of guardrails.
Wood dismissed those concerns, instead targeting the system that amplifies them.
""Isn't it sad, if not damning, that institutional shareholders rely on proxy firms to tell them how they should vote?"" she wrote in a follow-up post.
""Index funds do no fundamental research, yet dominate institutional voting. Index-based investing is a form of socialism. Our investment system is broken.""
Musk quickly backed her up on X, replying ""Absolutely"" to her post.
Wood has been one of Musk's most loyal allies on Wall Street, consistently framing his compensation as a reward for innovation rather than excess.
She previously called the Delaware court's move to strike down Musk's 2018 package ""un-American"" and urged the appeals court to ""do the right thing.""
If the new package passes, Musk's stake in Tesla could rise from 13% to nearly 29%, giving him significantly more control over the company as it doubles down on AI, robotics, and autonomous driving.
For Wood, the outcome seems certain. Despite the institutional backlash, she's betting Musk's base will deliver once again.
""Retail investors are likely to dominate the vote once again,"" she wrote. ""America!""

From ordering coffee to solving Wordle, it was the morning when everything went wrong.
An Amazon Web Services outage this morning took down a slew of online services. It delayed Starbucks orders, Reddit scrolls âÂ and yes, work Slack messages.
AWS' cloud services provide a backbone for many internet companies. On Monday morning, the company experienced a widespread outage, listing over 80 affected services on the status page for Amazon's cloud unit.
While Amazon said the underlying issue had been been ""fully mitigated"" earlier on Monday, outage reports spiked for US users on outage-tracking website DownDetector later in the morning as AWS continued to battle the issue.
Whether it was on their phone, laptop, or smart device, many consumers experienced the outage firsthand, from Alexa issues to fears of lost Snapchat streaks.
Home security and smart alarms were an early sign. For Alexa users, some woke up to their device acting up â and others said issues accessing their smart lights or rain sounds meant they couldn't fall asleep at all.
""I just had to get out of bed to unplug my alexa because it wouldn't stop my alarm no matter how many times I shouted at it,"" wrote one X user at 5:14 a.m. ET. ""Most effective alarm I've ever set honestly.""
""My amazon alexa alarm has been going off for 30 minutes. Just wanted to nap a little longer,"" another wrote.

Some Ring camera users also posted that their systems were down, heightening the sense of anxiety.
Umesh Khanna, the 28-year-old organizer of Forward Deployed Angels in San Francisco, arrived home late at night to find his apartment dark.
""A part of me thought I got hacked,"" Khanna said. ""Alexa wasn't working, therefore I can't turn on any lights, therefore I used my phone to get into our room.""
Over the phone, Khanna tried once again. Both his commands for Alexa to turn on the lights and open the blinds failed.
Small business owners walked in to find their booking systems down. Zoom callers found their meetings shut down. Apps for gig work platforms like Instacart and Lyft experienced issues.
For day-traders and market-watchers, the event was jarring. Some users said they were unable to access their Webull and Robinhood accounts. Others took to social media after they found they couldn't load their Coinbase wallets or their sports betting profiles.
Khanna said that he would've shorted Robinhood's stock, but he couldn't because Robinhood was down.

The outage left some students panicking â and others cheering â as the assignment platform Canvas was inaccessible.
Everett Lopez, a 23-year-old software development student at the University of Utah, said that he wanted to review his classes' slides when he saw that Canvas was down. He started worrying: ""Maybe I didn't pay my tuition on time,"" he told Business Insider.
Lopez hadn't had time to fully review the rubric for one of his programming assignments before the outage. He wanted to ask for an extension â but realized his professor's contact information was on Canvas. He ended up asking the professor in person, who clarified the rubric, he said.
The AWS outage also interrupted the workday for many corporate employees. Some engineers found that their vibe-coding tools, like Cursor and Vercel, weren't working. Some couldn't access Slack, or reported getting stuck in a Huddle meeting even after attempting to leave. Others complained that the rival Microsoft Teams didn't suffer the same issues.
wooo AWS outage. slack doesnt work and neither does anything at work.
The outage hit gaming hard.
People reported that Fortnite and Clash Royale were down. Roblox too.
For Wordle players, many found themselves unable to log in, which caused some streak recovery worries.
If you think YOU'RE having a bad Monday, the #AWS  outage means my 210-day #Wordle streak has disappeared!
Streaks were also a point of concern for Snapchat users, many of whom couldn't access the platform. ""Snapchat is planning to end my Streak of 1,090 DAYS. It will be bloody,"" one X user posted with a ""Joker"" GIF.
Many social media sites were affected. Users found that they couldn't save recipes on Pinterest or scroll their favorite Reddit message boards. AI friends even went down, as Character.AI faced an outage.
While its competitors went down, Elon Musk posted that X was still working.
twitter being the only reliable platform for when other apps go down. cause why tf snapchat DOWN pic.twitter.com/dqACChjoNQ
The run tracker Strava also faced issues. Alex Predhome, a 31-year-old operations worker from Somerville, Mass., was scrolling the site on his desktop when he noticed his feed wouldn't load properly.
Predhome was going to run in the morning, but said he decided against it: ""I'll just circle back to it in the afternoon, when Strava in theory might be back on,"" he told Business Insider.
Many people on the East Coast of the United States woke up to the outage, which interrupted a crucial part of their morning: coffee.
""The Starbucks app is down and now I have to go in and order like a peasant,"" one X user wrote.

13,2025-10-20,"As the U.S. markets wrapped up a volatile week with major indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq posting gains, investors are closely watching small-cap stocks ..."
14,2025-10-20,"The US and Australia have signed a deal intended to boost supplies of rare earths and other critical minerals, as the Trump administration looks for ways to counter China's dominance of the market. 
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the deal would support a pipeline of $8.5bn (A$13bn; Â£6.3bn) ""ready-to-go"" projects that would expand his country's mining and processing abilities. 
It includes $1bn to be invested by the two countries in projects in the US and Australia over the next six months, a framework text says.
The US and Australia have been working on these issues since Trump's first term, but Albanese said the latest agreement would take the partnership to the ""next level"".
On Monday, US President Donald Trump also commented on Australia's multi-billion dollar submarine deal with the US and UK, known as Aukus, saying it was ""full steam ahead"".
Earlier this year, the deal came under the spotlight after the Trump administration said it would review the details to ensure it fit with its ""America First"" agenda, raising concerns Australia may not be able to buy US submarines to replace its ageing fleet. 
Asked if Australia would be getting the submarines, Trump said: ""Oh no, they're getting them"".
China currently controls about 70% of rare earths mining and 90% of the processing of the materials, which are found in everything from defence equipment to computer chips and cars. 
US companies rely heavily on the materials, making them vulnerable this year as China has taken steps to restrict access to supplies in response to new US tariffs and other tensions. 
Albanese said the agreement was aimed at speeding investment in three types of projects, including US investments in processing facilities in Australia. 
The two countries also agreed to work together on issues such as pricing, permitting, and rules for government review of the sales of companies and projects in the sector. 
The US separately said it would invest in the construction of a 100 tonnes-per-year advanced gallium refinery in Western Australia and was preparing to offer some $2.2bn in financing to advance critical minerals projects via its Export-Import Bank. 
The Trump administration in recent months has already announced a series of investments in companies such as US rare earths miner MP Materials and Canada's Trilogy Metals and Lithium America's, which have projects in the US.
In exchange for the support, it has received ownership stakes in the firms. 
Ahead of the meeting, shares in Australian companies such as Lynas Rare Earths had jumped on the prospect of increased support. Lynas was awarded a contract by the US Defense Department a few years ago and is working on a project in Texas.
The framework published by the White House was light on details, reflecting the delicate issues at play. 
Australia is a major source of critical minerals but like the US, it relies on China, its biggest trade partner, for the processing required to turn the materials into something companies can use.
Crews tore down a massive covered entryway and windows in the East Wing to make way for Trump's new event space.
The deal is expected to be the focus of talks between US President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Monday.
The department, tasked with safeguarding the US nuclear stockpile, has never  before furloughed workers.
His former team, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, said they were ""deeply saddened"" by the ex-player's death.
The 18 decommissioned Confederate monuments have been deconstructed and displayed to make a statement on the horrors of slavery.

GM President Mark Reuss thinks that the company has one big lesson to learn from China's EV upstarts â and a few to avoid.
The auto executive said Western carmakers needed to match the speed at which BYD and its rivals build new models, but warned that they shouldn't try to copy China's EV playbook.
""I would say we can learn a lot from the speed. I don't think that copying each other and trying to price each other out of the market is necessarily a great thing,"" said Reuss, who was speaking on InsideEVs' ""Plugged-In Podcast"".
Chinese EV companies like BYD and Xiaomi are known for bringing new vehicles to market far quicker than their Western rivals.
A recent report from automotive consultancy AlixPartners found that the typical product development cycle for a Chinese EV firm was 22-28 months, compared to 32-48 months for global carmakers.
Reuss said Chinese automakers often use the same base of suppliers and are willing to rapidly adopt new innovations, allowing them to roll out new vehicles quickly and cheaply.
""They benchmark the heck out of each other, and then they will copy it and put it into production, so it's a very rapid cycle because of that,"" he said.
Reuss, who has worked at GM for 40 years, warned that Western automakers should be wary about trying to copy China's EV blueprint.
""There are a lot of companies that come and go, and they come and go often. Unless you're selling batteries, it's a pretty tough financial deal to make money over there,"" he said.
When it comes to electric cars, China has raced ahead of the rest of the world, with electric car sales expected to overtake conventional gasoline cars this year.
By contrast, the US has lagged behind, with major automakers rolling back their EV plans amid fears of slowing demand. Earlier this month, GM took a $1.6 billion charge due to its own EV strategy shift, having previously walked back plans to only sell electric vehicles by 2035.
However, only a handful of the 100-plus companies fighting for a piece of China's red-hot EV market are profitable, and industry figures have warned that many will not survive the next few years.
Some carmakers have resorted to slashing prices to drive demand, sparking a government crackdown on aggressive discounting.
Even BYD, which sells more cars in China than anyone else, is feeling the heat. Profits slid in the last quarter due to the escalating price war.
Reuss said that GM had ""a ton to learn"" from China's EV upstarts, pointing to their voice control integration and advanced infotainment systems.
He added that GM was ""absolutely"" thinking about the prospect of competing with Chinese carmakers in the US, which has introduced high tariffs to keep out BYD and its rivals.
""I think R&D technology investment in our company in this country is the way to compete. We can't go copy the way they do things and expect to win, so we have to be better,"" said Reuss.

16,2025-10-20,"
Britainâs Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has warned that the proposed $3.7 billion merger between Getty Images and Shutterstock could significantly reduce competition in the editorial and stock photography markets. 
According to the regulator, combining two of the largest photo licensing platforms could result in higher prices, less favorable commercial terms, and diminished service quality for media outlets and creative industry customers in the UK.
The CMA says its concerns align with issues raised by the UKâs News Media Association and other sector stakeholders. The authority first announced in August that it was assessing whether the deal would lead to âa lessening of competitionâ in the market.
âThe evidence indicates that the supply of editorial content is concentrated, and that Getty Images is the clear market leader,â the CMA says, per City AM.
âNo other supplier is of a similar size or has such a broad editorial offering. Shutterstock, while significantly smaller and somewhat differentiated in its offering, is one of the few material alternatives to Getty Images. Shutterstock is seen as a particularly good alternative to Getty Images in entertainment and archive content.â 
Getty Images and Shutterstock announced the agreement in January, aiming to create a combined entity valued at approximately $3.7 billion including debt. The companies are pursuing the merger during a period of rapid technological change, as generative AI tools increasingly reshape the image licensing industry.
In separate statements, both companies say they remain committed to the transaction and intend to work with the regulator to secure approval. Getty declined to answer Reutersâ questions on whether it has proposed, or intends to propose, remedies to address the CMAâs concerns.
The regulator has set an October 27 deadline for the companies to offer undertakings that would resolve its competition concerns. If acceptable remedies are not provided by that date, the CMA will refer the case to a more detailed phase two investigation.
Commenting on the merger in January, PetaPixelâs editor-in-chief Jaron Schneider called the deal âjust one more step down the road to rock bottom.â 
âThe new Getty Images after the merger is estimated to be worth $3.7 billion â thatâs nearly 75% of the entire marketâs value in 2025,â Schneider writes. âOne company owning that much of the industry would give it significant power to control pricing and squeeze out smaller companies like DepositPhotos, Dissolve, and even Adobe Stock.â
Photojournalist Angus Mordant told Artnet that the merger would âcreate a monopoly that only stands to hurt photographersâ since âboth Getty and Shutterstock have been notorious for leading the race to the bottom of the barrel with some of the lowest licensing rates in the industry.â

The ETF market, once a place for investors to make relatively unexciting bets that track whole sectors or indexes, has become increasingly speculative in recent years. 
New filings indicate that it's set to drift even further into higher-risk territory.
Asset management firm Volatility Shares has filed for regulatory approval for 27 levered ETFs, including a handful 5x-levered single-stock and crypto funds. 
The products, which aim to amplify daily moves in the underlying asset, would represent a significant shift in the leverage allowed by regulators if they are approved. Previously, the most leverage the Securities and Exchange Commission. has allowed for a single-stock ETF has been 2x.
The 5x ETFs would be tied to assets like bitcoin, ehtereum, and solana, and to some popular stocks including Alphabet and Tesla. Leveraged funds are riskier as they amplify gains and losses in the stocks that they track, in this case, by five times. 
For now, the approval of the assets is uncertain with the government shutdown halting activity at the SEC.
Asked about the filing, an SEC spokesperson said in an email: ""Due to a lapse in appropriations, the SEC is currently operating in accordance with the agency's plan for operating during a shutdown. During the shutdown, the SEC's public affairs office is not able to respond to many inquiries from the press.""
The SEC posted on Sept. 30 that some filings could become effective automatically after a ""certain number of days.""
But even if the SEC were running as normal, Bryan Amour, the director of ETF and passive strategies research for North America at Morningstar, said that the products' approval is not unlikely given the agency's approach in recent years.
""I think they stand a chance. This is testing the limits of the SEC's more accommodative policy under the new administration,"" Amour told Business Insider. ""I don't know where the limit is anymore for the SEC, and so it will be interesting to see.""
He added: ""They're trying to deregulate and improve the conditions for innovation. In that sense, I don't think there's anything innovative about a 5x levered ETF, but it does sort of fit the mold of let the market decide if this strategy deserves to be in the ETF wrapper rather than the SEC.""
Single stock ETFs, often coming in some type of leveraged form, are increasingly popular. As of December 2024, there were 102 single-stock ETFs on the market, with 61 of them levered, according to Morningstar data shared with Business Insider earlier this year.
Assets under management in single-stock ETFs have also gone way up in recent years, from $169 million in 2022, when they were first approved, to $24 billion in 2024.
Other sources told Business Insider they were concerned that the funds would make the market riskier, amplifying what many see as a trend gamification of the markets, particularly among the retail investor cohort. 
Volatility Shares declined to comment.
Armour highlighted data that's already demonstrated the risks of leveraged ETFs. 
""Fifty-five percent of leveraged ETFs that have launched have closed already,"" he said. Of the couple hundred that have launched, ""17% have lost over 98% of their value,"" he added.

Tim Cook, I hope you're listening. Because the people have spoken âÂ and they're begging for the iPod to return!
Recently, I wrote about how parents are desparate for something like an iPod for their kids. As more and more parents try to limit screentime, or delay giving their kids a cellphone, they want something that will let their kids listen to music, audiobooks, or podcasts.
Some parents are going fully old school and getting a CD player for their kid's bedroom. Others are buying portable MP3 players and loading them up with songs. There's even devices like The Mighty that are specifically designed for a screen-free experience for kids and can offline sync Spotify playlists.
But none of these options is exactly perfect for everyone â and I hear from parents all the time they just wish that they could get an Apple iPod.
Business Insider asked readers in a very unscientific online poll last week just how many wanted the iPod back. Out of 720 votes as of Monday afternoon, nearly 94% of people who responded wanted the iPod to return.
The survey is still open if you want to add your voice!
Now, of course, this probably isn't what Apple's own market research says. Apple discontinued the iPod in 2022, and that makes sense â most people are probably using their phones to listen to music these days.
But we can still hold out hope, right? RIGHT?!?!?!

19,2025-10-20,"A new history of the circumstances that led to the Great Depression sheds light on the systemic dangers we face today.
Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.
In his new book about the stock-market crash of 1929, the journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin recounts a scene from a summer day that year in Manhattan. The dining room of the Plaza Hotel came to attention, he writes, when top figures from Wall Street and the business world trickled in for Saturday lunch. The presence of such a crowd might not have created a stir at another historical moment, but these were not typical times. The nation was infatuated with the market, which was showering wealth on investors big and small.
Several of these boldface names, including the esteemed leaders of big banks, had a history of joining forces in market-manipulation schemes that were not a well-kept secret. Together, major players would form a pool and bid up a stock through âwash tradesâ with one another, creating the appearance of high demand, before they all sold, cratering the price and devastating the dupes who had followed their lead.
One might think that some of these men would have faced consequences, or at least lived in fear of exposure, even though their conduct was technically legal at the time. But they were well connected. One of them, John J. Raskob, was the chair of the Democratic National Committee and a prominent political donor; his biggest beneficiary, the former New York governor and presidential candidate Al Smith, was dining with him that day. Another, William Durant, had secretly met with President Herbert Hoover earlier in the year, to lean on him to stop the Federal Reserve Board from curbing Wall Streetâs excesses.
In his book 1929: Inside the Greatest Crash in Wall Street HistoryâAnd How It Shattered a Nation, Sorkin refers to âremarkable parallelsâ between the run-up to that crisis and todayâs political and economic climate, but he doesnât elaborate on the notion; his account is essentially a straight history, written in a journalistic register. Yet some revealing parallels do emerge from beneath the surface, and they donât reflect well on our current path. In addition to the greed and âthis time is differentâ hubris that precedes every stock-market tumble, the 1929 collapse was powered, it seems to me, by a more insidious and pervasive force that is in fact everywhere in evidence today.
Read: The lesson of 1929
The 1920s were, as Sorkin shows, an era in which Wall Street largely got its way and Washington kept its hands off, a precursor to President Donald Trumpâs tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks. More interesting to examine, in light of the present day, is how the environment became so perilously friendly to Wall Street in the â20sâand how it stayed that way even as red flags began to appear. The key element, I would argue, was the phenomenon known in regulatory circles as âcaptureâ: Wall Street and Big Business managed to co-opt the other centers of power in society. Those with clout in various spheres coalesced into one clubby circle, and fell prey to a groupthink that foresaw riches for everyone, without consequences. The regulatory bodies, the political and judicial apparatus, the pressânearly all of the mechanisms of correction in our system were either enfeebled or so aligned with the bullish and wealthy that it didnât occur to them to use what muscle they still had.
Some critics did raise alarms, most notably Senator Carter Glass, but the banking elite and their well-placed friends could safely ignore the skeptics, who would get swept away by the prevailing current. (Only after everything fell apart was the senator able to rein in banks with the Glass-Steagall Act.)
Financiers organized press offensives and enlisted top reporters as allies, offering lucrative jobs or outright bribes. Private-sector titans took on quasi-governmental rolesâfor instance, advising the president and negotiating deals with other nationsâor they became actual federal officials. The investor and industrialist Andrew Mellon enjoyed a lengthy tenure as Treasury secretaryâa forerunner to Trumpâs Treasury appointees, Steven Mnuchin and Scott Bessent, both of them recruited straight from Wall Street. The joke about Mellonâs influence, Sorkin tells us, was that three U.S. presidents served under him.
This kind of crossover calls to mind Elon Musk, who, like the J.P. Morgan chairman Thomas Lamont and other â20s moguls, became a player in public policy without going through the trouble of getting elected or being empowered by Congress. During Joe Bidenâs presidency, Musk made the decision to provide Ukraine and its troops with crucial access to his satellite-internet service, Starlink. After backing Trump with his considerable clout in the 2024 election cycle, he got himself tapped by the president to slash the federal bureaucracy through DOGE, in a rather blatant example of political capture. The fact that Musk and his giant businesses stood to benefit from severe cuts to the regulatory state did not go unnoticed (Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Carter Glassâlike critic, issued a report on the subject), but resistance had little effect.
No 1920s figure is so reminiscent of Musk as Raskob, the DNC chair, whose rise to great influence figured centrally in the crash. Raskob was an auto executive who fathered 13 children and became a wildly ambitious entrepreneur. He could move the market with an offhand comment about General Motors, where he was a director, much the way Musk tweeted about taking Tesla private and saw its stock promptly shoot up by more than $20 a share; the transaction never happened. Raskob took his own leap into the political fray by bankrolling Smith and using the DNC to settle scoresâwith the help of a pliant press.
Read: The decline and fall of Elon Musk
Musk hasnât co-opted the news media to nearly the same degree as did Raskob and his ilk in the â20s; reporters behind the typically sunny coverage of the time were widely believed to be on the take, Sorkin writes, and J. Pierpont Morgan âwas known to have countless journalists in his pocket.â Now many of the traditional press outlets are not so much corrupt as they are impoverished and weak, and their corporate owners have shown a willingness to knuckle under if enough force is applied. While vilifying the press, Trump has skillfully leveraged podcasters and streamers, and Musk was able to literally capture Twitterâby buying the companyâand thereby covertly shape the news and opinion that reaches the masses. Meanwhile, the best legacy outlets are far less influential than they once were. Itâs difficult to believe any longer that the next New York Times exposÃ© is going to take down or even contain the president. After all, he was already indicted four times, with help from reportersâand then won the popular vote.
Trumpâs own story represents the ultimate capture. In his administration, Big Money interests and political power are effectively fused within one person: the president himself. He doesnât always take the side of financiers and moguls, but when he does, he becomes not just their enabler but also their bullying representative. Bankers neednât meet with Trump in secret to lobby him to neuter the regulatory state; heâll do that himself. He has relentlessly assailed the putatively independent Federal Reserve Board, worked to weaken the Dodd-Frank Act and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and fired the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics after the agency released a worrying jobs report. His administration has also forged deals that give the government some stake in companies such as Intel, Nvidia, and U.S. Steel, further blurring the line between the public and private sectors.
Just before Trumpâs second inauguration, he issued his own Trump meme coin, which surprised no one by immediately exploding in value, directly benefiting his family. He thus became a major cryptocurrency entrepreneur days before taking office and launching a volley of crypto-friendly initiatives, pleasing an industry that had donated heavily to his campaign. Trumpâs Securities and Exchange Commission promptly put on hold a case against the crypto billionaire Justin Sun. (The suit accuses Sun of, among other things, creating a wash-trading pool, in an echo of the â20s.) Months later, Sun, a top investor in the Trump meme coin, attended a dinner with the president at one of his golf courses.
Trumpâs leniency toward dubious white-collar figures also extends well beyond the crypto realm. The president granted clemency to the fraudster Carlos Watson of Ozy Media, saving him from a 10-year prison term; commuted the sentences of Jason Galanis and George Santos after they won his favor; and pardoned the former Nikola CEO Trevor Milton, who was convicted of ripping off his investors. Trump explained himself by saying of Milton, âHe supported Trump.â

Moves such as these undermine the integrity of the wider financial system. Yet the danger of capture is not just that it can lead to a recession or even a depression. The danger is also moral. Capture can dramatically alter a societyâs conception of what qualifies as acceptable. In sober retrospect, it seems inconceivable that brokers during the â20s boom allowed customers to buy stock with borrowed money and only 10 percent down; if a share price dips by just 10 percent in this scenario, the trader is wiped out. The most prominent bankers in the country were unembarrassed to defend the practice by arguing that if the common person can buy a refrigerator on credit, why not a stock? The comparison is absurd, but the important point is that it didnât necessarily appear that way at the time. Neither did the notion of top financiers colluding to bolster the price of certain stocks.
Now we face a situation in which President Trump sets pro-crypto policy while his family businesses reap the rewards; the president fires officials who bring bad news; and convicted scammers are pardoned without even a fig-leaf rationale. Opponents have filed a number of lawsuits challenging the Trump administration, and some of them have found traction (a federal appeals court blocked for now Trumpâs order to fire Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook). But the Supreme Court has largely sided with Trump in his second term, the pardons are irrevocable, and the sheer volume of attacks on our financial system seems to ensure that many will prevail or, worse, be ignored or accepted. In contrast to 1929, when capture was not a well-publicized phenomenon, ignorance is an even less plausible excuse. The parties poised to check state power over our economy are well aware of the grifts and the graft, but they appear to have lost the capacity to act.
The term moral hazard entered the popular lexicon during the 2008 global financial crisis, which Sorkin chronicled in his hit book Too Big to Fail, to explain the widespread fear that bailing out banks would set a damaging precedent by rescuing them from the consequences of their own actions. In 2025, there is a twist: The moral hazard is plain as day before any large-scale consequences have even come. What was once beyond the pale has little by little become accepted. In that sense, the collapse has already begun.

20,2025-10-20,"ByTrefis Team,
Contributor.
In the last decade, Google stock has returned a massive $343 billion to its shareholders through hard cash via dividends and buybacks. This extraordinary cash generation stems directly from Google's dominance of the world's most profitable digital advertising market, where the company generated $264.6 billion in advertising revenue in 2024 - representing 75.6% of its total $350 billion in annual revenue. Google's cash machine operates on two fundamental pillars: its monopolistic grip on global search that delivered $198.1 billion in search advertising revenue alone in 2024, and YouTube's advertising juggernaut that contributed $36.1 billion annually from the world's second-largest search engine. 
The company's business model is particularly cash-generative because digital advertising requires minimal marginal costs - once Google's infrastructure is built, each additional search query or video view generates pure profit margin, allowing the company to convert this revenue dominance into $100.1 billion in net income for 2024. 
Furthermore, Google Cloud has emerged as the second major cash contributor, generating $43.2 billion in 2024 with accelerating growth as enterprises migrate to AI-powered cloud services, while the company's integrated ecosystem of Android, Chrome, Gmail, and Maps creates an unbreakable data collection and advertising targeting advantage that competitors simply cannot replicate. 
Letâs look at some numbers and compare how this payout power stacks up against the marketâs biggest capital-return machines. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmarkâa combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexesâand has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
As it turns out, GOOGL stock has returned the 3rd highest amount to shareholders in history.
Why should you care? Because dividends and share repurchases represent direct, tangible returns of capital to shareholders. They also signal managementâs confidence in the company's financial health and ability to generate sustainable cash flows. And there are more stocks like that. Here is a list of the top 10 companies ranked by total capital returned to shareholders via dividends and stock repurchases.
For full ranking, visit Buybacks & Dividends Ranking
What do you notice here? The total capital returned to shareholders as a percentage of the current market cap appears inversely proportional to growth prospects for reinvestments. Stocks like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) are growing much faster, in a more predictable way, compared to the others, but they have returned a much lower fraction of their market cap to shareholders.
That's the flip side to high capital returns. Sure, they are attractive, but you have to ask yourself the question: Am I sacrificing growth and sound fundamentals? With that in mind, let's look at some numbers for GOOGL. (see Buy or Sell Alphabet Stock for more details)
That said, GOOGL isnât immune to big drops. It fell 65% in the Global Financial Crisis, lost about 44% in the inflation shock, and saw pullbacks near 31% during the COVID-19 pandemic. Even the milder corrections, like 2018, led to a dip of around 23%. Strong fundamentals matter, but when volatility hits, even top stocks take a tumble.
Remember, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics."
21,2025-10-20,"Your thoughts revolve around faith today. A spiritual journey may take shapeâperhaps a temple visit with family. These shared rituals bring peace and affirmations of love. Parental blessings soothe old anxieties, grounding you in their silent strength. Ganesha warns, though: joy comes with effort. Expect the day to be packed and a bit draining, but also fulfilling. Physical tiredness aside, emotional satisfaction will leave its mark. A moment of prayer might just be your turning point.
Love brings contentment today. A pleasant evening with your partner is likely, and the time spent together offers joy without complication. Expect a relaxed mood and warm conversation. Simple gestures and shared moments make the day feel meaningful. Emotional ease defines the hours youâll cherish most.
Itâs a favourable day to invest in the stock market. Ganesha encourages taking advantage of the momentum. With luck on your side, your money could multiply. But act thoughtfully, not impulsively. Strategic moves can yield returns. Todayâs window may set the stage for longer-term financial optimism and growth.
The beginning might make you feel a crunch due to heavy workload, but later during the day you may feel relaxed and things will be under control. Second half of the day is also good for developing new ideas and thoughts, feels Ganesha.

Its key face Tejashwi Yadav will contest from Raghopur, and 41 sitting MLAs have been renominated.

22,2025-10-20,"A law firm in China has filed a new antitrust complaint accusing Apple of abusing its control over iOS app distribution and payments, escalating a dispute that previously failed in civil court by seeking action from state regulators instead, Reuters reports.
The new complaint was submitted to the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) on behalf of 55 Chinese iPhone and iPad users. The filing alleges that Apple maintains a monopoly over iOS app distribution in China via the App Store, restricts the use of third-party payment systems in apps, and charges commissions of up to 30% on digital transactions. Those claims mirror an earlier case brought in 2021 by individual plaintiff Jin Xin, represented by the same attorney, Wang Qiongfei. That lawsuit was dismissed in 2024 by a Shanghai court after demanding that Apple completely cease collecting its âApp Storeâ fee and pay damages.
Wang has now re-opened the case more broadly via a different channel, telling the media that the new administrative complaint is intended to prompt regulatory enforcement rather than a civil judgment. Unlike the 2021 filing, this complaint incorporates a comparative argument based on changes made in other jurisdictions. The filing asserts that Apple is continuing to operate a closed âApp Storeâ in China while permitting alternative payment methods and sideloading in the European Union following enforcement of the Digital Markets Act and a U.S. court ruling that obliges Apple to allow outside payment links.
Wang expects the regulatory complaint to proceed faster than the previous civil action. He is also appealing the 2024 dismissal to China's Supreme People's Court, which heard arguments in December. No ruling has yet been issued in that appeal.

So many tech products! It can help if you take a breath, a step back, and think about what you really need. We're here to help you do just that!
There are plenty of tech products out there. Some are great buys offering excellent value, but others aren't. Most fall somewhere in the middle.
Often, it's good to take a step back and see what you're going to get inside that pretty package. Was it worth what you paid for it? Will you get enough use from it to justify the purchase? Or maybe you should hold off and see what's coming next.
We can't make those decisions for you, but we can tell you what we think and maybe where you should start your decision-making process.
Sales, like Amazon's Prime Day events or any of the Black Friday deals days, are a great time to buy a new phone. They are also a time when regular pricing trends go out the window.
Normally, last year's model gets a healthy price cut when the new one launches, and buying one is a good way to get a great phone while saving a nice chink of money. Big sales can change this, though.
We saw it during the last one with the Google Pixel. Normally, the Pixel 9 Pro is a good bit cheaper now that the Pixel 10 Pro is here. But if you were shopping in early October, you might have noticed that prices were almost the same.
 



Now the Pixel 9 Pro is a good phone if the Pixel offers what you want. Saving a bunch of money and buying it over the newer Pixel 10 Pro isn't a bad idea, and there wasn't a big enough difference to justify spending a lot more money for a lot of us.
Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android
 



I never recommend buying a model that's more than two years old. However, there are some good reasons to buy a relatively new model versus a brand new one, though.
You will save some money. Once stock of a new model arrives, retailers want to move out all the existing stock, meaning they need to catch your eye, and the very best way to do that is to cut the price.
It's still new. When you buy a 2024 phone in 2025, it's probably still going to be brand new. That means you'll get the full warranty, and the battery won't have a year's worth of wear and tear. If it lasts 3 years when you bought it in 2024, it will last three years when you buy it in 2025.
No big improvements. Moore's law isn't dead, but it's on life support. Before we'll gigantic shift with much faster or more efficient hardware, science has to figure out where to put it and how to do it. It will, but for now, the newer stuff is only incrementally better than the older stuff.
You don't care about the new features. You know that a newer model Pixel is going to come with special Gemini AI tricks that older Pixels don't have. Some will never come to last year's model. If you don't care about them, don't pay extra for them.
 



Unless there is a serious manufacturing flaw, you can't go wrong buying the newest model. You'll pay for the privilege, though. Here's when you should buy the newest, and why.
The price. Normally, you'll pay more, but big sales events can change that. Decide on a number you're okay with; let's say $150. When the new model is less than $150 more than the older one, go for it.
Support lifetime. Every good company now offers multiple years of software support and updates for a new phone. A phone built in 2024 that comes with five years of support reaches end-of-life in 2029. One from 2025 lasts until 2030. If you plan on keeping it around for a while, this matters.
Manufacturer incentives. Often, a new model will come with things like a better trade-in policy, a discount on headphones, or even a great deal on other brand-new products like a smartwatch. Consider what else you'll be buying, what you have to trade in, and what the total price will be once it's all tallied up.
New features. Those Gemini AI tricks I mentioned above? You might really want one or more of them. If the only way you'll ever get them is to buy a new phone, well, you're going to have to do it.
There is no right or wrong answer for this one, because each of us wants something different. All I can do is tell you what I think and why, using that same Pixel as my example
Today, I would buy a Pixel 9 Pro over a Pixel 10 Pro. There are no real differences that matter to me, and I like saving money. That all changes if they are only $100 apart. I'd take the 10 Pro in a minute. Maybe something new will come along that requires the small hardware bump, and I'll have it, and I'll probably be able to find a coupon that saves me money on a charger or something.
I buy a phone for myself every two years, and I usually buy a model from the year before. This time, I didn't because of a big sale: I got my 2024 Moto Razr for a few dollars more than the 2023 would have cost me.
Shopping wisely and doing a bit of research saved me money. It can save you money, too.
 




A well-rounded flagship
Google's Pixel 10 Pro takes the same design from the Pixel 9 Pro and overhauls the internals. There's a faster Tensor G5 chip with a custom ISP, a bigger battery with magnetic Qi2 charging, and Bluetooth 6 support. Overall, this just might be the Android flagship to beat in 2025.

Welcome back! Did you notice something different about Alexa this morning? A major AWS outage appears to be disrupting more than 50 services, including Zoom, Snapchat, and many others.
Aravind Srinivas, the CEO of AI startup Perplexity, confirmed in an X post that its service is down. ""The root cause is an AWS issue,"" he said. ""We're working on resolving it.""
Meanwhile, there's still time to sign up for our event on autonomous vehicles. It's this Wednesday at 12 p.m. ET, featuring top auto-industry executives discussing how self-driving cars are becoming a fast-moving reality. Sign up here.
Now, in today's newsletter: I recently asked if loyalty or money in the workplace was more important to you. The results are in.
What's on deck:
Markets: Things got a bit nasty in the world of private credit.
Tech: Another twist is CoreWeave's $5 billion bid for Core Scientific.
Business: People who have quickly climbed the corporate ladder share their best remedies for avoiding burnout.
But first, a discussion on loyalty.
If this was forwarded to you, sign up here.
The tribe newsletter readers have spoken.
Last month, a story about loyalty in the workplace from the great Aki Ito prompted me to ask you a question: Would you prefer a workplace that values loyalty or one that pays you more money?
I admittedly had a theory. For as much stock as people put into loyalty, cash is a tough thing to turn down.
Boy, was I wrong!
As Aki covers in her latest story, nearly double the poll's respondents opted for a loyal workplace over one that pays better. Aki also included some of the incredible feedback she got from readers about why they're desperate for a change in the employer-employee relationship.
I chatted with Aki about what the future of workplace loyalty would look like.
Dan: First, congratulations on being right! I will stubbornly say I still think there's a difference between people anonymously answering a poll from their favorite newsletter writer and actually choosing loyalty over a higher salary in a real-life situation. But I should stop moving the goalposts to suit my argument and just take the L.
Aki: Haha, I mean you could still be right â I would love to see a real-life experiment of this! But I do have a real-life anecdote to back this up. As I wrote in my piece today, one person I spoke to faced this exact dilemma: Should he stay with his current employer that treats him well, or go for this higher paying job at this big corporation that previously ghosted him? In the end, he chose to stay. He chose loyalty.
Dan: I know you also heard from a professor who had a group of Gen Z students working on solutions to the workplace loyalty problem. That was striking, because I feel like the younger generation is the most comfortable with job-hopping. After all, many benefited from entering a workforce that initially rewarded people who jumped around. (But now I'm referencing your own pieces to you!)
Aki: Yeah, I'm a millennial, and when I talk to Gen Z workers, I'm often struck by how un-naive â even cynical â they are about work. Which isn't a criticism, by the way. I think their attitude makes total sense given the reality of the corporate workplace today. But I loved hearing that there are young people out there trying to come up with solutions, too. To fix things, it's not enough to see the reality as it is. You also need to have hope that things can get better, even if it's bad right now.
Dan: As much as I can be a cynic, I love that optimism. Ok, before I let you go, any chance you can give the readers a slight tease on what's coming next from you?
Aki: I have some stories in the works right now about the worsening hiring market and AI. In the medium-term, I want to keep writing these bigger stories about people's changing relationship to work. And I'm always open to ideas! If you're reading this, please get in touch at aito@businessinsider.com.
1. An inside look at the never-ending work of a junior banker. A lawsuit between a former investment banking analyst and Centerview Partners sheds light on what can be Wall Street's around-the-clock work schedule. As one banker described it in an email: ""The finish line is always going to be moving.""
2. The potential risk in private credit just went very public. Private credit had a tough week thanks to some loans going sour and critical comments from executives. However, some non-bank lenders were quick to defend their industry.
3. What is ""debasement,"" and why is it becoming the hottest trade these days? Concerns over rising government debt and inflation has investors skittish that currencies will maintain their current value. That's led to people rushing to gold, silver, and bitcoin. Here's how it works.
1. The Great Vibening is upon us. Corporate America is increasingly using ""vibes"" to describe automating the tedious, routine parts of a job. But vibe working is still working, and the term may disguise how much expertise is actually needed to do it. Beware bad vibes.
2. CoreWeave's $5 billion deal is on shaky ground. The third-largest shareholder of Core Scientific, the company CoreWeave is looking to buy, told BI he'd vote against the acquisition ""under the math of the deal today."" A dip in CoreWeave's stock price has weakened its offer and raised concerns among investors that Core Scientific is being undervalued.
3. Scale AI agrees to settle four lawsuits from contractors. The lawsuits, filed by former California contractors, accused the startup of misclassifying and underpaying them. Scale AI agreed to settle and has since stopped taking California gig workers.
1. Tariff pain, delivered by UPS. Package chaos is showing how tariffs have finally arrived at Americans' doorsteps. In addition to paying extra fees, some are finding they have to become amateur customs brokers to free their deliveries.
2. How Wall Street's brightest stars maintain the ""life"" of a work-life balance. We asked our latest crop of rising stars of Wall Street how they establish boundaries at work despite their high-pressure roles. From early-morning lifts to family time, here's how they stay grounded and fend off burnout.
3. An 18-year-old with a million-dollar startup. Zach Yadegari sold his first app before he could legally vote. Since then, he's founded an AI-powered nutrition app that generates around $30 million a year. His message to other young entrepreneurs: Ignore the noise.

Amazon stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) has performed strongly, rising 27% over the last six months. This impressive rally can be attributed to several factors: stronger-than-expected Q2 earnings, the accelerating growth of its AWS cloud business despite increased competition, expansion in its high-margin advertising segment, and growing confidence from financial analysts.
However, the stock did experience a temporary pullback following the Q2 earnings call, driven by cautious Q3 operating income guidance and persistent, intense competition in the cloud sector.
The critical question now is: Is AMZN stock still a buy at the current level of $215 after seeing these 27% gains?
While we acknowledge the stockâs overall strong operating performance and financial condition, this strength is arguably already reflected in its high valuation. Consequently, we believe the stock is Fairly Priced. In the sections below, we assess AMZNâs latest financial and operating performance, along with its downside resilience. 
That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like AMZN, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmarkâa combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexesâand has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
Letâs get into details of each of the assessed factors, but before that, for quick background: With $2.3 Tril in market cap, Amazon.com provides retail sales of consumer products and subscriptions globally, operates in North America, International, and cloud services, and manufactures electronic devices like tablets, TVs, and smart home products.
This table highlights how AMZN is valued vs the broader market. For more details, see: AMZN Valuation Ratios
This table highlights how AMZN is growing vs the broader market. For more details, see: AMZN Revenue Comparison
This table highlights how AMZNâs profitability vs the broader market. For more details, see: AMZN Operating Income Comparison
AMZN saw an impact slightly better than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. We assess this based on both (a) how much the stock fell and, (b) how quickly it recovered.
But the risk is not limited to major market crashes. Stocks fall even when markets are good - think events like earnings, business updates, outlook changes. Read AMZN Dip Buyer Analyses to see how the stock has recovered from sharp dips in the past.
Remember, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics."

Amphenol (NYSE: APH), a prominent producer of interconnect, sensor, and antenna solutions, is expected to announce its earnings on Wednesday, October 22, 2025.
The company is financially sound, with a market capitalization of $153 billion. In the previous year, Amphenol achieved notable profitability with $19 billion in revenue, $4.3 billion in operating profit, and $3.2 billion in net income.
Analysts expect earnings of $0.80 per share with sales at $5.56 billion, a notable increase compared to the year-ago quarter's $0.50 per share on $4.04 billion in sales.
Data from previous years strongly indicates a favorable post-earnings response. In the past five years, APH stock experienced a positive one-day return 65% of the time following its earnings release. The median gain for these positive instances was 2.3%, with a peak one-day return reaching 8.2%.
For event-driven traders, this strong historical trend may enhance their chances, although the actual performance in comparison to consensus will ultimately be the determining factor.
Traders typically have two primary strategies:
That said, if youâre looking for an upside with reduced volatility compared to holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. This portfolio has successfully outperformed its benchmarkâa blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexesâand has recorded returns exceeding 105% since its launch. Why is that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have generated superior returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; providing a less volatile experience, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
View the earnings reaction history of all stocks
Here are some insights regarding one-day (1D) post-earnings returns:
Additional information on the 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns following earnings is summarized along with the statistics in the table below.
A relatively less risky strategy (although it may not be effective if the correlation is weak) is to comprehend the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns after earnings, identify the pair with the highest correlation, and execute the corresponding trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D exhibit the highest correlation, a trader can take a ""long"" position for the next 5 days following a positive 1D post-earnings return. Below is some correlation data based on a 5-year and a 3-year (more recent) history. Please note that the correlation 1D_5D refers to the relationship between 1D post-earnings returns and the subsequent 5D returns.
Investing in a single stock without thorough analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stock benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to deliver strong returns for investors. What accounts for this? The quarterly rebalancing of large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive strategy to capitalize on favorable market conditions while minimizing losses when markets decline, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics."
31,2025-10-20,"Both the cheapest and the most expensive iPhone 17 models are reportedly seeing strong demand. A new market intelligence report says that the base iPhone 17 is proving especially popular.
The report says that in the first 10 days of availability, sales of the entry-level iPhone 17 were almost a third higher than those of the iPhone 16 a year earlier â¦
Counterpoint Research said that the iPhone 17 has seen extremely high demand in China in particular, whilst the iPhone 17 Pro Max is proving most popular in the US.
The iPhone 17 series have outsold the iPhone 16 series by 14% during the first 10 days of availability in China and the US, Appleâs two key markets that make up the bulk of iPhone sales globally [â¦]
Of the four iPhone variants, this yearâs base model iPhone 17 is performing well, especially in China, where consumers are reacting warmly to its strong value offering [â¦] In the US, the iPhone 17 Pro Max has seen the strongest ramp in demand as the big three carriers boost maximum subsidies by 10% ($100), reflecting a strategic shift towards ultra-premium customer segments in the US market.
Demand for the base model is said to be up 31% year-on-year, and the Pro Max 12% up.
Sales figures for the new iPhone Air are harder to determine as yet because its launch in China was delayed. However, a local report said that it sold out in retail stores in some cities within minutes of going on sale.
According to a report from the South China Morning Post, the iPhone Air âsold out within minutes of its launch in Chinaâ earlier today. The report explains that âminutes afterâ pre-orders began on Friday morning, the iPhone Air was sold out âat all bricks-and-mortar stores in Beijing and Shanghai, as well as in cities like Tianjin.â Online shipping estimates for the iPhone Air in China have also shipped to November in many configurations.
The report suggests that many iPhone owners are making their first upgrade since the pandemic.

The hype around the iPhone 17 is real.
Apple's latest lineup is outpacing its predecessor in both the US and China, two key markets for iPhone sales, according to new data from market research firm Counterpoint Research. iPhone 17 sales outsold the iPhone 16 series by 14% during the first 10 days of availability.
Apple's stock closed up 4% at a record $262.24 on Monday after the report was published, pushing its market capitalization to about $3.9 billion.
In the US, the iPhone 17 Pro Max â the most expensive iPhone model â saw the strongest demand in the lineup through the first two weekends of availability. The research firm credited the growth to COVID-era shoppers upgrading their devices. 
Counterpoint Research said Monday that the popularity of the Pro Max model comes as top phone carriers T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T shifted their strategies to focus on customers looking for all of the bells and whistles.
""The emphasis on Pro Max offers has made the ultra-premium Apple device more accessible to customers, bolstering premiumization trends and strengthening high-value customer ties to the Apple ecosystem,"" Counterpoint analyst Maurice Klaehne said in a statement.
Early data on Apple's newest and thinnest model, the iPhone Air, looks promising the US as well. The phone is selling better in its first two weeks than last year's iPhone 16 Plus, which didn't get an upgrade in 2025.
In China, the Air faced delays over issues with its e-SIM card and became available for preorder in the country on October 17. Its official release date is Wednesday, according to Apple's website. The iPhone Air will ""likely remain niche initially"" because it's more expensive than the base model, Counterpoint's Ivan Lam said.
The iPhone 17 has been selling well across the US and China, with unit sales nearly doubling that of the iPhone 16 sales, according to Counterpoint. The iPhone 17 was a ""major driver"" of the sales growth, with sell-out data up 31% year over year in the US and China, Counterpoint said.
""Simply put, it provides extremely good value-for-money,"" analyst Mengmeng Zhang said.
The strong iPhone performance is a boost Apple needs, as both regions make up the bulk of iPhone sales globally.

AppLovin (APP)âs stock surged 64%, fueled by solid earnings and a sharp revenue riseâbut behind the headlines lie analyst upgrades, a bold expansion, the S&P 500 inclusion, and even an SEC probe. 
What sparked this whirlwind? Letâs dig into the forces reshaping the stockâs trajectory and, more importantly, our current assessment of AppLovin stock. 
So, what is happening here? The stock price jumped 64%, driven by an 11% rise in revenue, a 13% boost in net margin, and a strong 29% lift in the P/E multiple. Letâs explore whatâs behind these moves.
Before we get into the details of events that led to the stock surge, here is what market wisdom says: Investing in a single stock can be risky, but there is a huge value to a broader diversified approach. If you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmarkâa combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexesâand has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
Opinion: We currently find APP stock attractive but volatile. Why so? Have a look at the full story. Read Buy or Sell APP Stock to see what drives our current opinion.
Risk: That said, APP isnât immune to sharp drops. During the Inflation Shock, it plunged about 92%, showing serious vulnerability despite strong fundamentals. Even the best companies can face steep losses when the market takes a hit. This kind of downside reminds us that no stock is totally safe, especially during extreme sell-offs. Risk is always there, no matter how bullish the outlook.
Picking winners consistently is not an easy task â especially given the volatility associated with a single stock. Instead, consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that?

A good Bluetooth speaker is one of those things that everyone should just have. Whether youâre heading to the park with some friends and planning to listen to some music while you hang or are just at home folding laundry and catching up on the latest episode of your favorite podcast, youâre gonna want a solid speaker. The JBL Clip 3 isnât the latest model, but it still produces quality sound at an inexpensive price point. Amazon has the Bluetooth speaker on sale right now so you can get one for 16% off. Itâs normally listed at $45, but for a limited time you can grab yours for just $38. Thatâs not too steep of a savings, but hey, $7 is still $7.
JBL has a built a name for itself in the world of portable Bluetooth speakers. With the JBL Clip 3, you can expect big sound from a small speaker that can clip onto your bag or belt. Yes, thatâs where the name comes from. This ultra-compact speaker has a carabiner clip built into the side of it so you can hang it on your person or perhaps the back of your beach chair so it doesnât have to sit in the sand.
See at Amazon
Take it to the beach or even poolside as the JBL Clip 3 is waterproof. No need to worry about a little splash, spill, or rain. Heck, the whole thing can even be fully immersed in water and come out fine. The exterior is made with a durable fabric material and a rugged rubber house to protect it, even if it gets dropped onto hard concrete.
Battery life is reliably long. It wouldnât be that great of a portable speaker if it had to spend most of its time plugged into an outlet. Well, the rechargeable lithium ion battery can hold onto a full 10 hours of playtime on a single charge.
If you want to take a call form your phone, you can do so while connected to the Bluetooth speaker. The JBL Clip 3 even has noise and echo-cancelling so when using it as a speaker phone, the folks on the other end will be able to hear you crystal clear.
JBL speakers come in a large assortment of colors and the JBL Clip 3 is no different. A couple are out of stock, but you can still pick between gray, blue, red, sand, white, yellow, green or even camo patterns in both black or green. All of which are currently on sale for the low price of just $38.

IonQ (IONQ) stock has fallen by 23% in a matter of days, from $82 on 10/13/2025 to $63 now. This can be primarily attributed to the announcement of a $2 billion equity offering. This offering, intended to raise cash, immediately concerned investors due to the potential for significant stock dilution. This specific event was amplified by broader, market-wide profit-taking across the quantum computing sector, which had recently experienced strong growth, partly driven by notable investments like J.P. Morganâs commitment to the technology. Related â Whatâs New With Rigetti Computing Stock?
What comes next? As it turns out, IONQ stock could fall even more. The current correction, when put in context of our âunattractiveâ opinion of the stock, suggests the possibility of further downside. A price of $45 is not out of the question, especially considering that the stock has seen this level in recent years.
So, do you think you should wait before buying this dip? Perhaps. There is no perfect way to time the dips. Nevertheless, here is another perspective on IONQ stock to help you make the decision. The stock has returned (median) 144% in one year, and 217% as peak return following sharp dips (>30% in 30 days) historically. For quick background, IONQ provides general-purpose quantum computing systems accessible via major cloud platforms like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Marketplace.
For details on stock fundamentals and assessment, read Buy or Sell IonQ Stock to see the full picture. IONQ stock has fallen meaningfully recently, and we currently find it unattractive. This may feel like a caution, and there is a significant risk in relying on a single stock. However, there is a huge value to a broader, diversified approach. If you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like IONQ, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmarkâa combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexesâand has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
IONQ had 8 events since 1/1/2010, where the dip threshold of -30% within 30 days was triggered
When analyzing potential stock dips, investors typically evaluate traditional financial health metrics like revenue growth, profitability, cash flow, and balance sheet strength to ensure the dip is not a sign of a deteriorating business.
However, for a quantum computing stock like IONQ, these metrics have limited immediate relevance. This is because the quantum computing industry is still in a nascent stage, focused on fundamental development and years away from widespread commercial application.
The companyâs business model relies on securing limited revenue from research partnerships, specialized hardware sales, and government contracts (e.g., its cloud-based QCaaS model), while simultaneously burning significant cash to fund its rapid, capital-intensive research and development. Therefore, the company's valuation is primarily based on future technological milestones, not near-term profitability.
Dip buying, while attractive, needs to be evaluated carefully from multiple angles. Such multi-factor analysis is exactly how we construct the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics."

First Solar (NASDAQ: FSLR), a prominent manufacturer of solar modules in the U.S., has experienced its stock increase by nearly 35% year-to-date, significantly surpassing the overall performance of the S&P 500. What factors are contributing to this surge? It is a mix of policy support, investor enthusiasm, and the momentum in clean energy.
Firstly, the U.S. clean energy initiative provides a strong advantage for solar manufacturers, with generous tax incentives and domestic manufacturing subsidies favoring companies operating within the U.S. Secondly, First Solarâs growing capacity in the United States offers it a competitive advantage as the country seeks to lessen its dependency on imported solar panels. Thirdly, First Solarâs commitment to domestic manufacturing and proprietary technology distinguishes it from its competitors. By using cadmium telluride thin-film modules and its innovative CURE process within a fully integrated U.S. supply chain, the company is strategically aligned to address the increasing domestic demand for electricity. Additionally, check out Is It Time to Buy First Solar Stock?
Nonetheless, here lies the stark truth â the stock is currently priced for perfection following a significant rise. While the fundamentals appear strong, expectations have escalated to a point where any shortfall could result in a sharp downturn. We elaborate further below.
That being said, if you are looking for growth potential with less volatility than investing in a single stock like FSLR, consider the High-Quality Portfolio. It has substantially outperformed its benchmark, which is a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indices, yielding returns of over 105% since its launch. What is the reason for this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have produced superior returns with decreased risk compared to the benchmark index, avoiding significant volatility, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Also, explore EBay Stock May Still Have Room to Grow
We agree that First Solar has an appealing long-term growth narrative, and weâve commented on its upside potential ourselves. However, have you examined the risks associated with the downside?
Think about this logically: markets donât move in one direction indefinitely, and the sentiment surrounding solar stocks can change rapidly. Despite solid profits at present, First Solarâs cash flow conversion is still weak, its profit margins are under pressure due to tariffs, and its valuation already incorporates optimistic assumptions regarding growth and policy stability.
When markets become risk-averse or if results fall short of expectations, high-expectation stocks like FSLR do not merely decline; they often take a significant downturn. This isnât hypothetical â it has occurred previously.
Let us reflect on 2022 when soaring inflation and increasing interest rates adversely affected growth stocks. The S&P 500 fell by 25%, but First Solar? It plummeted 49%, from $121 to $61 â almost twice the market's decline.
Although the stock rebounded quickly when clean-energy optimism returned, this highlights a crucial point: when sentiment worsens, FSLRâs downside potential increases. Investors should be aware that volatility can work both ways, and after a 40% year-to-date gain, historical evidence suggests the risk of a reversal is significant.
So, what is the realistic downside risk for FSLR stock at its current price of around $240?
If history serves as a reference, the downside could revert back toward the $150â$160 range, indicating a 35%â40% correction, roughly in line with its historical declines during market downturns.
This isnât fearmongeringâit merely reflects an observation of historical patterns. First Solar achieved $4.3 billion in revenue during the past twelve months, reflecting a 19% year-over-year growth, and generated approximately $1.4 billion in operating income, yielding a notable 32% margin. These results highlight the companyâs effective execution and profitability. However, even with such robust fundamentals, solar power remains a cyclical, sentiment-driven industry where the narrative can shift dramatically during earnings seasons.
The aim of this analysis is to underscore the genuine downside risk associated with FSLR stock. It may or may not materializeâbut it carries significant weight.
When positivity wanes or earnings fall short, even well-established companies can experience considerable corrections. Investors acquiring FSLR today are not purchasing a stock available at a discount, but rather they are wagering that favorable policy conditions, growth momentum, and execution will all align perfectly.
Should any of these factors falter, the downward movement could be swift and drastic. Ultimately, it hinges on your ability to tolerate that level of volatility while holding onto a stock that has already witnessed an exceptional performance.
If this level of risk feels uncomfortable, you might consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has consistently outperformed its all-cap benchmark (a mixture of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices) to provide solid returns for investors. What accounts for this? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offers a flexible strategy to leverage favorable market conditions while mitigating losses in declining markets, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics."

While I always welcome more competition in the Android smartphone market, one key player I havenât been so happy about is Google. At first, I was interested to see what Google could do and the potential that more stock Android smartphones could offer.
But over time, that interest has turned into concern â to the point that I actually wish Google didnât make smartphones. This isnât due to the hardware itself or even Google as a company, but rather Googleâs position as the primary developer of Android.
Over the past few years, many Android manufacturers have focused more on differentiating their devices on the software front rather than hardware. This incentivizes people to keep buying the latest smartphones even with extended Android update support and iterative hardware updates.
For example, one of my frustrations with Samsung is theÂ companyâs practice of keeping certain features, likeÂ Now Brief, limited to later devices, even if older models have the hardware capable of supporting them.
Google isnât exempt from this. It has showcased impressive hardware over the years, but I donât think it has escaped the pressure to sell more devices by emphasizing certain software features. Since it has its own line of smartphones, the incentive is to roll out improvements to its own devices rather than Android in general.
This is demonstrated by the sheer number of Pixel-exclusive features and apps that seemingly arenât tied to hardware limitations.
In my opinion, some of these features should be available as part of stock Android. Iâm happy for Pixels to keep their photo editing tools, but certain features would actually contribute to the safety of Android users.
Call Screen, for example, would be incredibly useful in helping Android users avoid spam and scam calls. Android currently has a built-in caller ID feature, but this hasnât been very useful in my experience. Instead, many users have to rely on third-party apps like Truecaller to try to avoid spam calls. Scam Detection would also help identify common scam formats.
A feature like advanced voice typing in Gboard would also enhance accessibility. You can access basic voice typing in Gboard on any Android device, but advanced features, such as adding punctuation and editing text with your voice, are limited to Pixel devices.
The Battery Health indicator available on new Pixels is another feature that I think should just be available on Android in general, especially as manufacturers move to higher charging speeds and newer battery technology.
There are some other Pixel features I would like to see on stock Android that arenât as essential, but are convenient.
The At A Glance widget, for example, is much more powerful on Pixel phones. While itâs available as a widget on other Android devices, its functionality is extremely limited, even if you use other Google apps that work with it. I compared my widget with my colleague Ritaâs. On my Honor and Samsung phones, I have a single page of toggles. Ritaâs Pixel, however, included just under three pages of toggles. Toggles that I donât have, despite using compatible Google apps on my phone â including bedtime, fitness, timers, and the flashlight.
Besides incentivizing Google to keep certain features limited to Pixel devices, I also think the companyâs status as a phone manufacturer gives it less reason to stay committed to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP).
Recent developments have made many people nervous about the future of Android as Google continues to tighten its reins on the OS.Â Google says that AOSP isnât going away, but Iâm not the only one who is concerned regarding the future of the project.
The delay of Android 16 QPR1âs source code has reignited fears around Googleâs commitment. And while Google might not necessarily delay the release of code to push smartphone sales, having its own hardware adds to the reasons why truly committing to an open source project may no longer make business sense.
Google has achieved its goal by making Android an open-source OS. Most of the worldâs smartphone manufacturers use it,Â leading to the proliferation of Google apps andÂ Google Mobile Services (GMS). The dominance of the Play Store alignsÂ with Googleâs business interests.
While the company likely wonât make Android fully closed-source, this doesnât mean Google will stay aligned with the spirit of open-source development. With the incentive to also push its own hardware sales, thereâs one less reason to really engage with open-source principles in good faith.
Now, some readers may argue that if I want to have access to Pixel-exclusive features, I should cough up and buy Googleâs hardware. After all, one canât expect Google to thanklessly create innovative software without reward.
However, the reality is that Google ignores certain regions when it comes to hardware availability. This applies not only to Pixel smartphones but also to Google Home devices and wearables. Even if you import a device or buy it from a local distributor, you wonât necessarily have access to all the features it offers. Thatâs partly why my colleague Hadlee regretted importing a Pixel.
Iâve experienced this living in South Africa. The Google Store isnât available in Africa, meaning you canât purchase devices directly from Google. While Fitbit had been on the market in South Africa for years, Googleâs acquisition of the company eventually led to it stopping the sale of devices locally. I have an old Google Home speaker, but certain voice commands werenât supported, so I eventually stopped using it.
For many people around the world, the only way to access certain Google features is through the hardware manufacturers that have agreements with Google and use its open-source software. Itâs why I have a smart TV box that includes Google TV, even though no first-party Google devices are available in my country.
The more Google moves towards focusing on Pixel-only features and moving away from engaging with Android as an open-source initiative in good faith, the less people in excluded markets will be able to access useful features. Thereâs already a divide between who has access to what features from Google, and I worry that this will only worsen over time.
While Iâm always happy to see competition in the smartphone market, I think that due to a combined number of factors, Googleâs sale of its own smartphones hurts more than helps the future of Android. It was always likely that Google would tighten its control of Android once it had achieved the desired market share. But the sale of its own smartphones contributes to a divide in who can access important features that should just be part of the core Android OS.

Cryptoâs October 10 flash crash wiped out an estimated $19 billion in liquidations and $450 billion in market capitalization. Much has been written about the chaos and what worsened the cascadeâhigh leverage, thin liquidity and stablecoin depeggingâso I am not going to rehash it all for you here. Whatâs clear is that the marketâs infrastructure did not pass this stress test.
The problem, however, starts with how crypto markets operate in general. Most retail and institutional traders use the same exchanges that not only match buy and sell orders but also act as liquidity providers and custodians. This all-in-one setup creates convenience for users and outsized profits for exchanges that capture value across the entire trade lifecycle.
But in a crisis, this convenience becomes a liability. When you trade on Binance, for example, your funds are usually held in Binanceâs custody. If the exchange experiences downtime or freezes withdrawals, your assets become effectively trapped.
âThe idea that this captive, vertically integrated business model is the future of institutional trading is false, and last weekend really spotlighted that fact,â says Brandon Mulvihill, cofounder and CEO of digital asset trading firm Crossover Markets. âThereâs real systemic risk when these exchanges go down. Whether participants are makers or takers, they can only get out of that risk once the exchange comes back online. The separation of duties matters.â
Another key factor to consider is pricing. Unlike stocks, which trade on regulated and highly liquid exchanges equipped with built-in safeguards, crypto assets move across a patchwork of loosely connected venues with varying liquidity and inconsistent trade execution.
As traditional equities slid into the close and after-hours sessions on October 10, intraday data revealed a growing disconnect between digital assets and the NSADAQ-100. Bitcoin and dogecoin saw far steeper intraday swings than major stock benchmarks, according to digital asset analytics firm Kaiko, underscoring how crypto markets still trail traditional exchanges in risk controls and market stability.
The silver lining here is that the crash will likely accelerate a shift that was already underway, part of which is smart money moving from exchanges to over-the-counter (OTC) desks that aggregate liquidity from multiple sources, creating a buffer against a liquidity crunch on any one venue. Just in 2024, the crypto OTC market grew 106%, according to a report from Finery Markets.
The shiftâs also creating an opportunity for firms like Mulvihillâs, which has built what he calls cryptoâs first true electronic communication network (ECN), a system that automatically matches buy and sell orders by connecting major brokerages and institutional traders without a centralized exchange layer.
Mulvihill says one of the world's largest marker makers has actually approached his firm in the October 10 aftermath, and that Crossover has been growing about 100% every six months to a 100-strong institutional client base.
Ultimately, this could mark the emergence of a new and important layer for crypto trading. âWeâre creating what we would normally call an inter-bank or inter-dealer market,â adds Mulvihill. â This provides fungibility and a separation of duties that ultimately collapse the cost of trade.â"

    Not every AI video generator will be right for your project or budget. Here's how to choose one that's right for you.
  
AI video generators are the next wave of generative AI.
Move over, chatbots and image generators: This is the era of AI video generators.
Nearly every major tech company has dropped some kind of AI video model over the past two years, marking the next wave of generative AI tech. Between Sora, Google's Veo 3 and Midjourney, it's quickly become a crowded market. AI videos are a huge leap forward in a company's AI creative offerings, and they're something worth keeping an eye on as generative AI becomes a bigger part of the content we create and see online. This is especially true as questions about theÂ legalityÂ and ethics of AI-generated video abound.
Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.
Many of these companies also have chatbots and image generators, but I was surprised to find there were unique differences in the video generators. Some of my favorite image generator features pop up in the video models, while others are noticeably absent, for example. Because there are so many options, I've compiled all the major models you can consider, including their pricing, privacy and my hands-on testing of each.Â  
This is everything you need to know about AI video generators. This list is regularly updated with the most recent info on each generator. 
AI video generators are one of the latest ways tech companies are using generative AI. These programs use text-to-video and image-to-video technology that lets you create short video clips. You enter a short description called a prompt, or upload an image to animate, and the software creates a clip entirely made with gen AI. These AI videos tend to be between five and 10 seconds long, and certain models offer synchronized audio. Because this tech is new, errors -- called hallucinations -- are possible. 
Some examples of AI video generators you can use now are Sora by OpenAI, Veo 3 by Google, Adobe Firefly and Midjourney's V1. They are all are paid programs that produce decent results and let you customize your shot with control panels. Runway, an AI start-up that co-created the Stable Diffusion image generator, is another AI video option with freemium plans. Other AI models from Luma, Pika and Ideogram are also available. 
Sora joined the ChatGPT family at the end of 2024, but it was its revamp with Sora 2 in Oct. 2025 that had fans flocking to the AI. You might know the name Sora from OpenAI's new social media app that uses the same name. But Sora is the name of the original AI video model, and you can create videos with Sora without needing an invite code to use the app.
Through the web browser, Sora is a pretty user-friendly program. It doesn't have the same conversational UI as Dall-E 3 -- you can't ""chat"" with Sora to make follow-up revisions. Instead, it's more of a traditional AI creative services. In Sora, you have a panel to customize your video's dimensions, length and stylistic feel. You can enter a prompt or upload an image for Sora to animate, and you can use a few editing options to perfect your video from there. Sora videos also come automatically watermarked, designating their AI origins.
Sora is only available to paying ChatGPT users. If you're a ChatGPT Plus user ($20 per month) you'll get 50 priority generation credits per month, with videos up to 5 seconds long at 720p. Upgrading to the Pro tier ($200 per month) gets higher monthly credits, including 500 videos created with priority/fast generation and unlimited videos with relaxed generation. Pro subscribers can also create higher-resolution videos at a max of 1080p, extend the duration of their videos up to 20 seconds and have the option to download videos without the watermark.
OpenAI's privacy policy states that it may train on your content unless you opt out. To do that in Sora, go to Settings > General, and turn off Improve model for everyone. You can also exclude your videos from public explore feeds in settings. (Disclosure: Ziff Davis, CNET's parent company, in April filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)
Google's Veo 3 AI video generator enthralled AI enthusiasts when it was publicly released at its 2025 I/O developers conference. In my testing, I found Veo 3 to be a nice step up from my disappointing experience with Veo 2, but the true difference is audible: Veo 3 can generate and automatically sync audio to your video clips. 
Veo 3 videos are eight seconds long, at 720p resolution and are automatically generated in a horizontal 16:9 format. It's a very capable program and the videos are detailed and fun, but it isn't immune to all the usual AI errors and hallucinations.Â 
Veo 3 is available through the $20 per month Google AI Pro plan and its filmmaker-focused program Flow. You can also give Veo a test run on YouTube. Creators can now createÂ AI-generated backgroundsÂ for their Shorts videos, powered by Veo.Â 
Videos automatically have Google's SynthID watermark embedded (not visible on the clips). Google Cloud's general AI policy states it does not train on customer data without permission.
Midjourney is one of the most popular AI image generators, and it just released its first AI video model called V1. You can use Midjourney to create video clips between 5 and 21 seconds long in 720p resolution. You can use Midjourney through Discord or its website. Right now, video generation is paywalled for users, but it's one of the cheaper options at $10 per month.
Midjourney's privacy policy says it can use personal information and information included in your prompts to improve its service. If you create in Stealth mode, then your AI images will be private; otherwise they will be shared in a public gallery.
I was fairly impressed with Midjourney's value for the price, but you will need to be patient and specific with your prompts.
Firefly's standalone AI video generator is available for you to use now, on your computer and through its Firefly mobile app. If you're familiar with Firefly's AI image tools, the video generator setup will feel familiar. The left-side panel lets you customize your clip, and it has the added benefit of letting you select the kind of motion you want (zoom in and out, move right and left, etc). You can also select the camera angle you want, like if you wanted to mimic drone footage with an aerial view.
Some Creative Cloud plans include Firefly access, including if you're paying for a single program or all of the Adobe apps. You can check and compare options here. If you don't have an existing Adobe plan, you can try the Firefly standard plan ($10 per month) to create up to 20 videos a month. If you need more generation credits, the Pro plan ($30 per month) gets you up to 70 videos a month. Both Firefly plans come with unlimited AI image generation. Your Firefly videos will be 5 seconds long, at 1080p with no audio.
Adobe says that videos created with Firefly are commercially safe, and its AI policy states it will not train on your content. Firefly videos don't have a visible watermark, but its content credentials are automatically attached to your work. Firefly models are trained on licensed and public domain content.
AI enthusiasts might recognize Runway as the start-up that co-created the popular AI image generator Stable Diffusion. You might also recognize Runway from a landmark deal it made with a major film studio last fall. Lionsgate agreed to open up its catalog -- thousands of hours of movies like The Hunger Games and John Wick and TV shows like Mad Men -- to be used to create custom AI models for the studio to use.
During my brief testing of the service, I was impressed with the prompt-building tools and the general ease of finding my way around. I've also used the service before as part of Canva's Magic Media app, which is convenient if you're a Canva lover. You can use Runway for free on its web app, with 125 monthly credits -- you'll use about 20 credits with each generation, so it's a pretty low limit. Upgrading ($15 per month or $144 annually) gets you 625 monthly credits, access to newer models and the ability to upscale videos to 4K and download without watermarks.
Runway's terms of service says it can train its AI on your prompts and the resulting videos but doesn't retain ownership over them. Its privacy policy also states that Runway may disclose your information to affiliates, business and marketing partners. The videos you make are automatically private.
Notably absent from this list is Meta. The company has devoted its resources to develop AI, but it doesn't have a publicly available AI video generator. It teased a version of one in October 2024. Here's what we know so far. 
Meta's AI video model -- Movie Gen -- is only a research concept right now and not publicly available, with no word on when it may be. 
Thanks to a research paper Meta published, we know Movie Gen videos could be 1080p HD and up to 16 seconds long at 16 frames per second. The most notable thing going for Movie Gen is the possibility of synchronized audio. Meta said that Movie Gen could also be used to create sound effects, ambient noise and instrumental music up to 45 seconds long. There's always a chance this feature doesn't make it to the final cut, but it would give Meta an edge.
Perhaps like with Google and YouTube, we'll see some AI-powered features pop up first on its social platforms, Instagram and Facebook. (We already have a number of other AI features eating up space on our feeds.) Meta's AI models for its chatbot and image generator are trained on publicly available Facebook and Instagram content, as well as licensed data.

Apple overtook Microsoft as the worldâs second-most-valuable- company Monday after a stock rally fueled by heightened demand for the iPhone 17, the tech giantâs latest flagship model, pushed the tech behemothâs market cap near the $4 trillion mark for the first time ever.
Apple shares closed up 3.9% at $262.24 on Monday, marking the stockâs highest close of all time.
Mondayâs rally comes after a report from Counterpoint Research found the iPhone 17 outsold the iPhone 16 by 14% in China and the U.S. within its first 10 days of release (Sept. 19).
U.S. and China sales for the base iPhone 17 model account for 22% of Appleâs newest offerings, up 31% from the iPhone 16âs initial 10-day sales.
The iPhone makerâs stock is now up 5.9% in the last week of trading.

$3.9 trillion. That is Appleâs market capitalization as of Monday afternoon, reaching above Microsoftâs $3.8 trillion market cap. Only Nvidia ($4.4 trillion) is more valuable.
âBuying this device is a no brainer, especially when you throw channel discounts and coupons into the mix,â Counterpoint senior analyst Mengmeng Zhang said in a statement, citing numerous feature improvements and the same price point as the iPhone 16 upon release. âSimply put, it provides extremely good value-for-money, and Chinese consumers are rewarding Apple for that.â
Appleâs stock is up 5% since the start of the year, significantly lagging broader market gains. The companyâs shares tanked to $172.42 in April following President Donald Trumpâs sweeping tariff announcements. Apple, which is reliant on China for manufacturing, lost nearly $640 billion in market cap following the presidentâs decision. Apple managed to secure conditional tariff exemptions on iPhones and semiconductors from the Trump administration, committing $500 billion toward the administrationâs push for bolstered domestic manufacturing. However, a larger trade war with Beijing is at risk of breaking out following Trumpâs announcement of potential 100% tariffs against China. The U.S. already has a 30% tariff rate in place on China.

This report answers the question: Is the digital ad market still growing? For over 25 years, the IAB has been the definitive source for U.S. internet advertising revenue. Its historical data charted the shifts from dial-up to broadband, and then from desktop to mobile. Today, itâs charting the next great reallocation of capital. When your CFO wants authoritative numbers on the industryâs health, this is the gold standard.
The report surveys companies representing over 86% of U.S. internet ad revenue, meaning its figures are based on actual, verified spending. The format breakdowns show how much capital is flowing from established channels like traditional search into high-growth areas like social video, connected TV, and retail media.
U.S.-only data; reflects reported revenue from participating companies, which may be delayed by one quarter compared to actual spending; excludes international markets and smaller ad networks below the survey threshold.

If the IAB report is a photograph of last year, MAGNAâs forecast is a detailed blueprint of the next 18 months. It helps you anticipate whether paid search costs (CPCs) are likely to spike based on an influx of advertiser demand. Their analysis is global, allowing you to see which regions are heating up and which are cooling down.
Their retail media breakouts are useful for making the case to invest in product feed optimization and marketplace SEO. For example, if MAGNA forecasts a 20% surge in retail media while projecting only 5% growth in search, itâs a signal that commercial intent is migrating.
The twice-yearly cadence is its secret weapon. The December update gives you fresh data for annual planning, while the June update allows for mid-year course corrections, making your strategy more agile.
The forecast model relies on historical patterns, economic indicators, and advertiser surveys. It is subject to revision due to macroeconomic changes. Coverage varies globally, with the most robust data in North America and Europe, while forecasts for the China market carry higher uncertainty.

This is the single most important quarterly report for anyone in search.
The key metric is revenue for the âGoogle Search & otherâ segment; its growth rate tells you if the core business is healthy, plateauing, or declining. Compare this to the growth rate of âYouTube adsâ to see where user attention and ad dollars are shifting.
A secondary indicator to watch is âGoogle Cloudâ revenue. As it grows, expect more integrations between Googleâs enterprise tools and its core search products.
Pay close attention to Traffic Acquisition Costs (TAC), which includes the billions Google pays partners like Apple and Samsung to be the default search engine. If TAC is growing faster than Search revenue, itâs a major red flag that Google is paying more for traffic that is becoming less profitable.
In the current environment, the most critical part of the report is the management commentary and the analyst Q&A. Look for specific language about AI Overviewsâ impact on query volume, user satisfaction, and any hint of revenue cannibalization.
The âGoogle Search & otherâ bundles search with Maps, Gmail, and other properties, which prevents isolated analysis of search revenue. AI Overviews metrics are disclosed selectively and not on a comprehensive quarterly basis. Geographic revenue breakdowns are limited to broad regions.

Microsoftâs report provides a direct scorecard for Bingâs performance via its âsearch and news advertising revenueâ figures. This tells you whether the search engine is gaining or losing ground. Their integration of OpenAIâs models into Bing has made this a number to watch.
However, the bigger story often lies in their Intelligent Cloud and Productivity segments. Pay attention to commentary on the growth of Microsoft 365 Copilot and enterprise search features within Teams and SharePoint. This reveals how millions of professionals are finding information and getting answers without opening a traditional web browser.
Methodology & Limitations: 
Search revenue is only reported as a percentage growth, not in actual dollar amounts, which makes market share calculations more complex. Details about enterprise search usage metrics are rarely shared openly. Geographic breakdowns are also limited. To estimate Bingâs market share, we need to infer from revenue growth compared to traffic data.

This report tells you how much commercial search is shifting from Google to Amazon.
For years, Amazonâs advertising business has grown faster than its renowned AWS cloud unit. Thatâs an indicator of where brands are investing to capture customers at the point of purchase. The year-over-year ad revenue growth rate can help with justifying investment in Amazon SEO and enhanced content.
Look beyond the ad revenue to their commentary on logistics.

The ITU, a specialized agency of the United Nations, provides the data for sizing total addressable markets for international SEO.
Its connectivity metrics show which countries have the infrastructure to support video-heavy or interactive content strategies, versus emerging markets where mobile-first, lightweight content is still essential.
The most actionable metric for spotting future growth is âbroadband affordability.â History shows that when the cost of a basic internet plan in a developing country drops below the 2% threshold of its average monthly income, that market is poised for growth.
Government-reported data quality differs across countries, with some nations providing infrequent or incomplete reports. Affordability calculations rely on national averages that might not account for regional differences. Additionally, infrastructure metrics often lag behind actual deployment by one to two years.

Googleâs enforcement data provides a glimpse into what may soon impact organic search results. Often, policies first appear in Google Ads before making their way into search quality guidelines. Violations by publishers show which types of sites might get banned from AdSense, sometimes acting as a warning sign for future manual actions in organic search.
When enforcement becomes more active in fields like crypto, healthcare, or financial services, it usually indicates that stricter E-E-A-T standards are on their way for organic results.

In todayâs world of AI-generated content and widespread misinformation, trust is more important than ever. Edelman has been tracking public trust in four key institutions â Business, Government, Media, and NGOs â for over 20 years. Their findings offer a helpful guide for establishing your contentâs authority.
When the data shows that âBusinessâ is trusted more than âMediaâ in a particular country, it suggests that thought leadership from your companyâs own qualified experts can be more believable and relatable than just quoting traditional news outlets.
The differences across generations and regions are especially useful to understand. They reveal which types of authority signals and credentials matter most for different audiences, giving you a clear, data-driven way to build E-E-A-T.
Survey sample favors educated, high-income populations in most countries, with 1,000-1,500 respondents per nation. Trust is a self-reported perception, not behavioral; country choice focuses on larger economies. Trust in institutions may not reflect trust in brands or sources.

Deloitte monitors streaming service adoption, content consumption trends, and attention fragmentation, all of which influence your content strategy. Their research on subscription usage and churn rates shows how users distribute their entertainment budgets.
Their insights into ad-supported versus subscription preferences indicate which business models resonate with different demographics and content types. Data on cord-cutting and cord-never behaviors illustrate how various generations consume media.
Their analysis of social media patterns reveals declining platform popularity, providing early signals to diversify channels.
This U.S.-focused study mainly involves higher-income digital adopters, with streaming behavior centered on entertainment, which may not reflect overall information habits. The sample size of 2,000-3,000 limits detailed demographics, and trends may lag six to 12 months behind mainstream adoption.
Use this set of reports to connect market trends and signals with your search and content decisions.
Start with quarterly earnings and ad forecasts to calibrate budgets after core updates or seasonal swings. When planning campaigns, check platform adoption and discovery trends to decide where your audience is shifting and how theyâre finding information.
For content format choices, compare attention and creative studies with whatâs working in Search, YouTube, and short-form video to guide what you produce next.
Review earnings and forecasts each quarter when you set goals. Scan broader landscape studies when you refresh your annual plan. When something changes fast, cross-check at least two independent sources before you move resources. Look for consistency in your data and donât act on one-off spikes.
The best SEO and marketing strategies are built on more than instinct; theyâre grounded in data that stands up to scrutiny. By making these reports part of your regular reading cycle, you have a basis to make solid decisions that you can justify.
Each dataset offers a different lens that allows you to see both the macro trends shaping the industry and the micro signals to guide your next move.

For years, UK retail investors have watched American traders share screenshots of extraordinary gains from options trades on social media. A call option turning Â£500 into Â£50,000 overnight. A put trade that perfectly timed a market crash. Meanwhile, British investors trying to replicate these strategies faced a maze of complex platforms, hefty fees, and interfaces designed for institutional traders rather than regular people.
That exclusion is ending. Two major developments in 2025 have cracked open a market that was technically available but practically inaccessible to most UK retail investors.
Retail options trading has become synonymous with Robinhood in the US. But while the GME saga unfolded, it was not yet available to UK investors. Until recently. 
When Robinhood launched options trading for UK customers in February 2025, the response validated what many suspected: British investors had been desperate for accessible options trading all along. The platform that democratized options in America brought the same simplified approach to the UK market, offering zero contract fees through May and a streamlined mobile interface.
But Robinhoodâs entry was just the beginning. Small local players also want a piece of the action.
This week, UK fintech Investa opened its second crowdfunding round on Crowdcube, aiming to raise Â£1 million after its previous campaign was overfunded by 220% in 2024. The company's success story reveals something important about UK market dynamics that Robinhood might have missed.
""The support we received from the Crowdcube community last year was phenomenal,"" said Alec Beasley, co-founder and CEO of Investa. ""It not only validated our mission to make options trading accessible to UK retail investors, but also highlighted that on-the-go traders want a level playing field.""
Investaâs approach differs from Robinhood in crucial ways. While both offer zero-commission trading, Investa has designed its platform specifically around options education that UK investors, less familiar with options trading than their American counterparts, are likely to need. One of the features the app aims to expand upon is what the company calls ""Option Sidekick"" - a feature that asks users simple questions about their market view and suggests appropriate options strategies, complete with scenario analysis showing potential outcomes.
More importantly, Investa has made a deliberate decision that sets it apart from US platforms: customers cannot sell ânakedâ options. This eliminates the unlimited loss potential that has led to horror stories of retail traders owing hundreds of thousands of dollars they do not have.
The technical infrastructure for options trading has existed in the UK for decades. The London Stock Exchange has offered options contracts, and several brokers provided access to both UK and international options markets. So why did options remain the preserve of professional traders and wealthy individuals?
The answer lies in accessibility barriers that went far beyond regulation. Traditional UK platforms treated options as an advanced feature bolted onto stock trading platforms. Users faced complex order screens with dozens of parameters, Greek letters (delta, gamma, theta) without explanation, and minimum account balances that excluded smaller investors.
Interactive Brokers, one of the most sophisticated platforms available to UK retail investors, exemplifies this problem. While offering extensive options access, its interface resembles Bloomberg terminals more than consumer apps. The learning curve is steep, the minimum deposits substantial, and the user experience assumes prior knowledge of derivatives trading.
These platforms were not designed for someone wanting to make their first options trade with Â£100. They were built for investors already comfortable with concepts like implied volatility and time decay.
The new generation of UK options platforms takes a mobile-first approach that prioritizes simplicity over sophistication. Instead of overwhelming users with every possible options strategy, these apps focus on the most common use cases: hedging positions, generating income, and directional speculation.
Investa's ""options cards"" strip away the jargon and complex chains that characterize traditional platforms. Users see simplified information about potential profits, losses, and breakeven points without needing to understand Black-Scholes pricing models.
This approach mirrors what happened in the US, where Robinhoodâs simplified interface attracted millions of new options traders. The difference is that UK platforms are learning from American mistakes. Robinhood's UK launch validates the market demand, but also reveals the challenges. Options trading requires more education and hand-holding than stock trading. Getting the balance right between accessibility and safety will determine which platform captures the UK market.
Behind the simplified interfaces lies a complex challenge: how do you make sophisticated financial instruments accessible without misleading users about the risks involved?
Both Robinhood and Investa are required put users through appropriateness tests before accessing options trading. But these regulatory checkboxes do little to prepare someone for the reality of watching an options position lose 50% of its value in a single day due to time decay.
Investa's approach of showing scenario analysis for each potential trade represents one solution. Users see exactly how much money they could make or lose under different market conditions and timeframes. This educational component is built into the trading process rather than relegated to separate help sections.
The UK market also benefits from more conservative regulatory oversight compared to the US. While this might slow innovation, it provides guardrails that could prevent some of the spectacular losses that have plagued American retail options traders.
The revolution in UK options trading accessibility is not just about the democratisation of financial services. It represents the evolution of what some have called the âDegenerate Economyâ  where speculation is increasingly seen as entertainment. Instead of offering complex tools and expecting users to adapt, these platforms are adapting tools to match user capabilities.
Whether this democratization ultimately helps or merely entertains retail investors remains an open question. But for the first time, UK investors have real choices in how they access options markets. The exclusion is ending, and the real experiment is just beginning."

Lam Research (NASDAQ: LRCX), a prominent provider of chip fabrication equipment, is set to announce its earnings on Wednesday, October 22, 2025.
The company currently boasts a remarkable market capitalization of $180 billion. In the past twelve months, Lam Research was operationally profitable, reporting $18 billion in revenue, $5.9 billion in operating profit, and $5.4 billion in net income.
The current consensus predicts earnings of $1.22 per share on revenue of $5.23 billion. This is in comparison to figures from a year ago of $1.28 per share and $4.17 billion in revenue.
Lam Researchâs stock provides a compelling case for event-driven traders, given that its post-earnings movement does not display a strong historical trend.
Over the last five years, the stock has demonstrated an equal likelihood of either rising or falling following the announcement of results:
This balanced volatility indicates that LRCX is not the typical stock to trade based on a foreseeable earnings surprise, but instead resonates with its characterization as a robust buy-and-hold stock. For context, LRCX has experienced exceptionally strong long-term appreciation, increasing by 210% (from $45 in early January 2021 to roughly $140 now), significantly surpassing the S&P 500âs rise of around 75% during the same approximate five-year duration.
While much hinges on how the results compare to consensus expectations, historical trends can still provide an advantage. Traders can:
That being said, if you seek potential upside with less volatility than owning an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has significantly outperformed its benchmarkâa mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indicesâachieving returns exceeding 105% since its launch. Why is that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks yielded superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; a smoother experience, as reflected in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Some insights on one-day (1D) post-earnings returns:
Additional information regarding observed 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns following earnings is encapsulated alongside the statistics in the table below.
A strategy with relatively lower risk (though not advantageous if the correlation is weak) is to comprehend the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns following earnings, identify a pair with the highest correlation, and undertake the corresponding trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D exhibit the highest correlation, a trader can position themselves âlongâ for the next 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Here is some correlation data derived from a 5-year and a 3-year (more recent) analysis. Note that the correlation 1D_5D denotes the correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns.
Investing in a single stock without thorough analysis can be precarious. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to deliver solid returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offered a reactive approach to capitalize on favorable market conditions while mitigating losses when the market declines, as elaborated in RV Portfolio performance metrics."

Despite popping on the day of the release of its interim results, the Tesco share price (LON:TSCO) looks to have peaked. With the shares struggling to breach their 450p price ceiling, I reiterate my previous call that further upside for the stock is limited at this juncture.
Tescoâs interim results were a pleasant surprise â perhaps not so much on the top line, but more so on the bottom line. Group revenue increased 3.6% to Â£36.04 billion, driven by UK and ROI sales, which were up 5.6% to Â£24.67 billion and 6.4% to Â£1.54 billion, respectively. Booker also realised a decent gain of 2.4% to Â£4.73 billion, with Central Europe a healthier 4.4% to Â£2.11 billion. Meanwhile, fuel sales fell 9.8% to Â£2.99 billion.
The main revelation came in the form of gross margin, which ticked up 6bps to 7.88% amidst loftier commodity costs. This, however, was offset by the more expensive labour costs from higher employersâ national insurance and minimum wage, as EBIT margin declined 9bps to 4.65%. Be that as it may, EBIT was still 1.5% better at Â£1.67 billion thanks to stronger sales as a result of lofty market share gains, and the firmâs Save to Invest cost savings programme.
Consequently, pre-tax profits rose 2.3% to Â£1.41 billion. This was helped by the fact that net finance costs were slightly lower from last year, at Â£263 million from Â£269 million the previous year. And with a tax rate of 26.9%, attributable profit grew 2.1% to Â£1.03 billion. Nonetheless, thanks to the impact of share buybacks, Tescoâs EPS had a much more meaningful increase of 6.8% to 15.43p.
As a result of the stellar half, management upgraded its guidance for the year, going from a range of Â£2.7-3.0 billion to Â£2.9-3.1 billion. Whilst I had expected an upgrade on the lower end of the guidance by Â£100 million, the Â£200 million boost on the low end alongside the extra Â£100 million on the high end was a welcome development. But considering the better-than-estimated margins in H1, the guidance is well suited and arguably still a bit conservative.
When questioned on the earnings call on the rationale behind the guidance upgrade, the board mentioned that their outlook is still contingent on market competition not intensifying further â and I agree. That said, Tesco is unlikely to realise the same gross margin appreciation in H2 due to less favourable weather, the EPR levy, and a still intense pricing environment with Christmas expected to be as competitive, if not more.
In addition to that, I believe the continued UK market share gains of 0.8% which Tesco enjoyed towards the end of Q2 wonât be sustainable going into the winter. This would, therefore, limit the gross margin growth potential which Tesco benefitted from stronger economies of scale in H1. In fact, Iâm forecasting market share gains to slow slightly, not helped by the tougher Y/Y comps the company is also lapping.
So, whatâs next? Well, for FY26 through to FY28, Iâve dialled down my previous revenue forecasts by a tinge. One of the reasons for this is slower market share gains than previously expected moving forward, with ASDAâs decline bottoming out. Another is from a more modest growth outlook for ROI, as I anticipate competition across the Celtic Sea to remain hot for the foreseeable future despite the progress Tesco has made.
Nevertheless, this is largely offset by my bottom line upgrades in EPS. Because of the better margin mix Tesco is leaning towards (more discretionary items, online orders, Tesco Finest uplift), I have conviction that these will serve gross margins well. Combined with the impact of AI on efficiencies and the build out of Tescoâs digital proposition, I see plenty of opportunities for Tesco to build on its margins over the medium term.
As such, I expect the FTSE 100 stalwart to finish the year with an EBIT thatâs slightly above the guidance the team has given, at Â£3.13 billion â exactly the same as last year. Interpretiv also has the groupâs EPS CAGR at 11.2%, roughly unchanged from a previous 11.7%. However, with a PEG ratio of 1.4 against the blended sector and 5-year average of 1.6, I donât see much upside for the Tesco share price. Thus, I reiterate my price target of 450p."

U.S. stocks rose Friday and notched gains last week as the government shutdown continues. The shutdown is now the third-longest in U.S. history. The record is 35 days from Donald Trumpâs first presidential term. There was also a 21-day shutdown under President Bill Clinton. 
Last week, the large-cap S&P 500 index rose 1.7%, the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite gained 3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the blue-chip index, was up 1.6%.
Health care subsidies are central to the standoff between Republicans and Democrats. Democrats want Affordable Care Act subsidies to continue, and Republicans have refused to negotiate. Meanwhile, federal workers are set to miss their first full paycheck this week, which was originally scheduled for electronic deposit on Oct. 24.  
Key government data releases, including the monthly jobs report, are also delayed due to the shutdown. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will publish the September 2025 Consumer Price Index (CPI) report on Oct. 24, but no other reports will be produced until the government reopens. The inflation report will be instrumental to the Federal Reserveâs next meeting on Oct. 28 and 29. 
The Fed last met on Sept. 16 and 17, when the committee reduced the federal funds rate by a quarter-point and acknowledged the dual risks of inflation and unemployment. If the September CPI shows higher-than-expected prices, the Fedâs job of stimulating jobs gets more complicated. Lower interest rates can support higher employment but can also fuel price increases. CME FedWatch currently shows a 96.7% probability that rates will decline again in October, down from 98.7% on Friday.

QuantumScape (NYSE: QS), a company without revenue that's dedicated to developing solid-state batteries, is set to announce its earnings on Wednesday, October 22, 2025.
Given that QuantumScape is still pre-revenue, it has been burning cash, as indicated by its latest financial results: an operating loss of $-506 million and a net income of $-463 million. The current market cap is $8.6 billion.
For traders focused on events, the stock's past performance surrounding earnings is significant. Over the past five years, QuantumScape's stock has yielded a negative one-day return in 67% of cases following the announcement of results. The median negative return on these occasions was -6.4%, with the highest one-day negative return reaching -17.1%.
Although the results will ultimately depend on how the performance aligns with consensus and expectations, recognizing these historical trends can provide a competitive advantage. Traders typically adopt two primary strategies:
That said, if you are looking for an upside with less volatility than simply holding an individual stock like QS, consider the High Quality Portfolio.

 From Matthew Graham at Mortgage News Daily: Another Boring Day With Mortgage Rates Near 3-Year Lows[W]e're hanging out near 3 year lows with minimal volatility. In order to see sharper, more sustained momentum, we'd likely need the government shutdown to end. That would allow the most consequential economic reports (like the jobs report) to be released. It would also allow data collection to resume for future jobs reports.

Between now and then, there is other data to guide the rate market, but it's just not as heavy hitting. This week is particularly light in that regard, but there's one exception. The BLS received an exception to compile September's CPI inflation data, to be released this Friday. It's not quite on par with the jobs report, but it can certainly get rates moving (for better or worse, depending on the details). [30 year fixed 6.22%]

An ailing stock that hit a fresh all-time low suddenly surges on a burst of retail-investor enthusiasm despite high short interest from hedge funds â does that sound familiar?
It should if you've been even casually following the meme stock saga since the early days of the pandemic. Except this week, instead of GameStop, we're talking about plant-based meat maker Beyond Meat, and instead of Keith Gill (aka Roaring Kitty), we're talking about a trader named Dimitri Semenikhin.
The conditions surrounding Beyond Meat's recent stock rally are remarkably similar to the now-iconic Gamestop short squeeze of 2021 when Roaring Kitty inspired a retail investor army to pump GameStop shares to the moon. In addition to focus from retail, the stock has also been heavily shorted by institutions, with short interest above 50% as of last week.
Now, it looks like Semenikhin, who is based in Dubai, is trying to inspire a similar winning streak for the struggling faux meat company.
For now, it appears to be working. The stock surged 128% on Monday to close at $1.47 a share, exiting penny-stock territory after crumbling to $0.50 last week.
Posting on Reddit, Semenikhin said last week that he had purchased about one twentieth of the shares oustanding. He further unpacked his bullish thesis in a video on Sunday night titled ""Why I've purchased 4% of Beyond Meat Stock.""
""Beyond sold shares to new investors for near $3 per share and used the money to repay its debt. This move was bullish for Beyond, removing its previously high risk of bankruptcy and greatly strengthening its balance sheet,"" his video explained.
Business Insider caught up with Semenikhin to hear about his bullish thesis on the stock.
Like Keith Gill, Semenikhin goes by an animal-themed moniker. He posts on Reddit and YouTube under the name Capybara Stocks.
Semenikhin, who works as a real estate developer, said that his investment strategy centers on identifying companies with low share prices and high financial warrants and debt.
While Semenikhin's initial post has been removed by Reddit, Business Insider verified his position through screenshots of his brokerage account, confirming that he purchaed 3.1 million shares on October 14, when the stock closed at $0.78 a share.
""At the current price that I bought in, the pricing was just way too low for what was happening,"" he told Business Insider. ""It was very straightforward that it shouldn't be trading at this price.""
Semenikhin's bullish thesis centers on the completion of Beyond Meat's convertible note exchange that saw the company agree with bondholders to swap notes due in 2027 for $196 million in new notes due in 2030, as well as 316 million new shares.
The announcement sent the stock spiraling last week, but he argues that the issuance of new shares was misinterpreted by investors as a bearish development. In Semenikhin's opinion, the dynamics of Beyond Meat's note exchange have ratcheted up the likelihood of a massive short-squeeze in the stock.
He also said that he sees the company's recent moves as buying time to either grow or to be acquired, and he isn't concerned about reports of declining demand for fake meat.
His bullishness appears to have won the hearts of retail traders online, with users cheering on his initial post on Reddit and the comment section of his YouTube video awash in rocket emojis.
Semenikhin's sudden rise to retail-investor stardom is emblematic of a stock market that's allowed individual traders to steal the spotlight from big institutions. Roaring Kitty, with his regular YouTube updates and well-honed thesis on why he liked GameStop stock, was the first, but there have been others since.
The stellar rally in shares of Opendoor stock this year has its own retail mascot in Scott Findlay, who told Business Insider last month that he's bullish on the ""boots-on-the-ground, gorilla marketing campaign"" being waged by hedge funder Eric Jackson.
""I find that it's a regular recurrence that whenever such events arise, and the company is small, people just don't read 8-Ks, they don't read the analyst notes,"" Semenikhin said about how he goes about looking for opportunities. ""They don't know what's happening. I think that's why there's so much price mismatch.""
As Beyond stock started surging on Monday, it quickly became the top trending name on r/WallStreetBets. Data from Stocktwits shows that sentiment among traders is ranked as extremely bullish while message volume surrounding the stock has spiked. Mentions of the stock on Reddit are up 84% in the last 24 hours.

Understanding The Difference Between Planning and Executing and Realizing Growth
There is a lot of noise about âGo-to-Marketâ going on in the market. But not a lot of substance. 
The term Go-to-Market (or GTM) actually means something. But itâs been largely reduced to a buzz word. A buzz word that makes marketers sound more strategic. Something that PE investors sound more scientific. In a broad sense, it helps growth leaders sound like they understand a commercial model that has become very complicated. And it helps software vendors sound more cutting edge.
Larry Friedman, who wrote the definitive text on Go-to-Market Strategy two decades ago defines it as a strategic plan, or game plan. Pretty much every other consultant, agency, blogger in the world circles around a similar focus. Even Wikipedia calls it a plan. And technically, Larry is correct. 
But what this definition leaves out is that GTM is a very very complicated plan. With lots of moving parts. Across functions, silos, systems, teams, and stages of the revenue cycle. And GTM planning has become even more complicated with the advent of digital channels, sales enablement, and now AI. Making matters worse, they donât teach managers how to connect and manage all these channels in business schools.
Consequently, a GTM is a plan that is very difficult to execute. And if you canât execute your GTM plan, then you cannot generate revenues. My smarter clients called these types of plans âCredenza wareâ because they largely sit on the shelf while the people and systems generating revenue muddle along in silos against isolated goals. 
So how did GTM become so complex? Friedman provides a history of this evolution of GTM into a complex multi-channel system in his book. To start, he makes it clear that businesses have been âgoing to marketâ for centuries - albeit in a very analog and human way. 
The actual term Go-to-Market emerged in the 1980s to describe some changes in the commercial model that are profound. Until the 1980s, the predominate way businesses âbrought their products to marketâ involved a lot of humans knocking on doors, visiting offices, or working behind counters. The emergence of direct mail, call centers, Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), and ultimately the worldwide web introduced a wider array of channels into the mix. These channels cost less, moved faster, and appealed to more and more customers in more and more elements of the revenue cycle. Suddenly selling your product involved many, or dozens of âchannelsâ that needed to be coordinated, provisioned, enabled, and managed.
Managing all this complexity and connecting all these moving parts means that Go-to-Market is best defined as a system. Go-to-Market is a system that aligns the key revenue generating functions and teams in your business â and the processes systems, operations, and information that support them - along the revenue cycle to drive profitable, scalable, and reliable growth. 
So, the misconception that marketing can lead the GTM is flawed. Product, Sales, Customer Success, and Finance, and increasingly IT all need to work together to execute the revenue plan. Another outdated notion is GTM investment is largely made up of operational budgets for advertising, promotions, events, and campaigns. Over the last two decades, weâve seen that large investments in technology are required to make the GTM smarter, faster, and more effective. Capital investment in digital channels, automation, AI, databases, and commercial assets (like brands, IP, innovations) are a big part of what makes the modern GTM run. And half of the value a GTM team creates really depends on how well they work together and share information.
This makes executing the GTM is a process-driven, technology enabled, capital intensive team sport. Executing your GTM plan involves aligning your growth functions and product teams â and the systems, data and channels that enable them - along a revenue cycle to maximize growth, profits, and customer lifetime value. Thatâs a mouthful.
A more concise way of saying all that is Revenue Operations. Revenue Operations is essentially the systemization of this GTM. 
Until the executives understand and manage Go-to-Market (or GTM) as a system - a system that generates more profitable, scalable, and reliable growth in their business â theyâll be describing something they cannot fully act upon or realize.
So, what is involved in systematizing your GTM to get results? A number of things. Some involved collaboration, teamwork, and ways of working management. Others require digitizing processes and connecting systems. Here are six things that I see separating GTM planning from executing those plans and realizing their full revenue potential. 
âYou canât execute a modern Go-to-Market without Revenue Operations,â reinforces Steve Busby, the CEO of Revenue Operations Associates, a company that offers RevOps certification programs and GTM acceleration tools that help businesses unlock their GTM potential. âRevOps is emerging as the strategic discipline required to execute, accelerate a modern GTM strategy as growth becomes more data driven, digital and client driven. The expectation that AI will transform the GTM only amplifies the importance of the RevOps function and discipline.â  "

EAMobile gameShutdownThe SimsThe Sims Mobile 
EA will soon shut down The Sims Mobile after nearly eight years of updates. As you might expect, longtime fans of the mobile spin-off arenât happy about EAâs decision, but also arenât surprised, as the game had stopped receiving substantial new content updates some time ago.
Released back in 2018. The Sims Mobile is a free-to-play mobile spin-off of Maxis and EAâs popular life simulator series, The Sims. When it launched all those years ago, it was a big hit for EA, bringing in $25 million in its first six months on the market. And since then, the game has received over 50 free updates while also being worked on by three different studios. And now, itâs all wrapping up as EA prepares to delist the game, unlock all the content for people still playing, and eventually turn off the servers for good.
On October 19, EA posted an update on the official Sims Mobile website announcing that the F2P mobile game would be officially delisted from all mobile stores on October 21. In-app transactions will also be turned off. Players will still be able to play The Sims Mobile and even redownload and install it after that date, but new folks wonât be able to join in the fun. Then on January 6, 2026, EA will unlock all Build Mode and Create A Sim items for all players regardless of level. The idea is to give players two weeks to build their dream homes and create their perfect Sim characters. Then it all dies. On January 20 at 1:59 PM UTC, The Sims Mobile servers will turn off and wonât turn back on again. Thatâs it. Because the game is online only and all data is stored on EAâs servers, once theyâre shut off, the game is dead.
âOn behalf of the entire Sims Mobile team, thank you for sharing this amazing journey with us,â said the team behind the game. âWe hope you enjoy the final update and that these final months allow everyone to finish projects, make memories, and celebrate their Sims.â
The writing was on the wall for Sims Mobile. Last year, EA announced that the game would no longer get new updates. This was the first big sign among players that the aging game was likely not going to be around for much longer. Still, over on the Sims Mobile subreddit, longtime players are mourning the news and upset with EA for killing the game, as many view The Sims FreeplayÃ¢ÂÂanother mobile Sims gameÃ¢ÂÂto be an inferior, uglier, and more microtransaction-riddled spin-off. Others werenât happy that EA let the game live in zombie mode for a year and continued to let people invest money into Sims Mobile.
âWhat can I even do at this point? I feel robbed by EA. I had no prior knowledge until I discovered this Reddit when the Instagram page announced this,â said one user who has been playing since they were 12.

MicrosoftNext-GenROG Xbox Ally XXbox 
Xbox has never had more range and more variety as it aims to be more things to more people. Thatâs the platformâs message as it addresses next-gen hardware questions and the sticker shock of the ROG Xbox Ally X, even as some fans wonder if they should still bother investing in the companyâs growing multiplatform ecosystem.
While those players continue to question just how committed Microsoft is to console gaming, Xbox representatives continue to beat the same drum: new dedicated hardware is coming. Will that be a traditional console, a Windows gaming PC in an Xbox shell, or something in-between? The company isnât saying just yet, but continues to hint at a next-gen lineup that breaks with its past.
Ã¢ÂÂWe are 100 percent looking at making things in the future,Ã¢ÂÂ Xbox President Sarah Bond told Variety last week. Ã¢ÂÂWe have our next-gen hardware in development. WeÃ¢ÂÂve been looking at prototyping, designing. We have a partnership weÃ¢ÂÂve announced with AMD around it, so that is coming. What we saw here was an opportunity to innovate in a new way and to bring gamers another choice, in addition to our next-gen hardware. We are always listening to what players and creators want. When there is demand for innovation, weÃ¢ÂÂre going to build it.Ã¢ÂÂ
That focus on âwhat players and creators wantâ was reiterated by Xbox corporate vice president of gaming devices Roanne Sones. âWe have a variety of innovations in store that IÃ¢ÂÂm really excited about, and theyÃ¢ÂÂre going to sit side by side with this collaboration that we have with ASUS,â she recently told The Hollywood Reporter. âYouÃ¢ÂÂve seen how weÃ¢ÂÂre willing to take some of the hardware IP that we do have and use that to kind of boost and get more choice and more flexibility to players. At the end of the day, thatÃ¢ÂÂs what should be guiding us, not some weird boundary.â
Both interviews came alongside the launch of the new Xbox-branded Asus PC gaming handheld. The Xbox Ally X is in contention for being the best Windows gaming device out there right now, even if it has a bunch of OS kinks that still need to be worked out. But any recommendation is overshadowed by the glaring price tag.
At $1,000, the premium Windows handheld experience is double the price of a standard Switch 2 and Steam Deck, and still $200 more than last yearâs ROG Ally X Z1 Extreme. If the Xbox Ally X came in at $800 or less, it would feel like compelling competition that wasnât just aimed at high-end enthusiasts. So why is it priced so much higher?
Ã¢ÂÂWe looked at, how do we create multiple options for people? And it really was Asus, because this is their hardware,Ã¢ÂÂ Bond told Variety. Ã¢ÂÂThat is all of their insight into the market, into the feature set, into what people want, to determine the ultimate prices of the devices.Ã¢ÂÂ
While it may have been Asusâ decision to make, the main culprit is President Trumpâs tariff-fueled trade war with China and other East Asia manufacturing hubs. âItÃ¢ÂÂs all to do with the macroeconomic factors,â Sones told The Hollywood Reporter. âIÃ¢ÂÂm not going to specify specifics around what prices were or werenÃ¢ÂÂt, but I think the dynamic of why you see the price as it is, is because of what we are dealing with more broadly in the consumer electronics industry.â
Maybe that means weâll eventually see a more competitively priced Xbox Ally X in the future, or maybe Microsoftâs next-gen ambitions will be torpedoed by the Trump administration before they can even get off the ground. Even at $1,000, though, Microsoft says the Xbox Ally X is selling out.
Ã¢ÂÂI feel really good about the value that weÃ¢ÂÂre giving gamers for the price, based off the reception to the hardware,â Bond said.

GDP data was a beat, though housing sales data weakness explains why Chinaâs government should settle the trade war, so it can pivot to the real economic issues in China. New home prices fell -0.41% from August to September. Meanwhile, new home prices in first tier cities fell -0.3% month-over-month, led by Guangzhou, which saw prices fall -0.6%, and Shenzhen, which saw prices fall by -1.0%. Used home prices for September were also disappointing, falling -0.6% from August overall and -1.0% in first tier cities.
Asian equities were higher on easing US-China trade tensions less Malaysia and Vietnam while Singapore was closed for Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights.
There were several positives overnight, as President Trumpâs comments were conciliatory and positive. Chinaâs Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokespersonâs comments were, too. Treasury Secretary Bessent will meet Vice Premier He Lifeng this week in Malaysia, following a positive call on Friday, while Chinese trade negotiator Li Chenggang was removed from his post after Bessent called his August Washington DC meeting âunhingedâ.
Growth stocks led Hong Kong higher, as Alibaba gained +4.86%, Tencent gained +3.21%, and Xiaomi gained +2.57%, as strong online retails sales likely helped Alibaba and JD.com.
Breadth was strong in both markets, though volumes were a touch light, as the Hang Seng Index closed just below 26,000. Hang Seng Tech Index was just below 6,000, while Shanghai and Shenzhen consolidated. A Mainland media headline reported that ETFs in China had ~$9 billion of inflow in September, as gold, bond, and stock funds were beneficiaries, as banks continue to cut deposit rates leading to a small reallocation to the stock market.
The Fourth Plenum kicked off with President Xi delivering the concisely-worded ""Proposal of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development"". The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) held a conference focused on excess capacity in the cement industry.
Concidentaly, Chinaâs crude steel production declined -4.6% year-over-year (YoY) to 73.49 million tons, brining the year-to-date (YTD) output down by -2.9% YoY. The next Five-Year Plan will heavily emphasize science and technology, though it will be interesting to see whether the anti-involution campaign will be included in the Plan. Fitch Ratings said the anti-involution campaign could improve the credit profile of the companies, as they benefit from âoutput rationalizationâ, i.e. curbing excess production.
Bloomberg is reporting mainland listed Sany Heavy Industry will list in Hong Kong, after raising $1.6 billion.
Iâve always respected the intellectual capital of sell side analysts and sales traders. JP Morgan hosts an institutional investor conference around the IMF and World Bank meetings, which includes a survey of the 300+ attendeesâ views on markets and their allocations. Iâm not going to give away their intellectual capital though their question on China allocations is absurdly low. The percentage of respondents who hold zero China is between 33% to 50%. The percentage of attendees who were overweight China is tiny!
China stocks bottomed in January of 2024, and they still hold zero China? This shows the amount of capital not participating in the rally due to the geopolitical and media narrative. I would argue this is predominantly a US institutional investor as I head back to the airport again to visit with institutional investors outside of the US. The re-rating of Chinese stocks is arguably in the early days based on this survey, Chinaâs weight in MSCI indexes, and professional investor allocations, which we access via Copley Fund Research.
I am rooting for a successful Trump-Xi meeting in South Korea next week for many reasons.

Cleveland-Cliffs (NYSE: CLF) is scheduled to announce its earnings on Tuesday, October 21, 2025. We anticipate the company will reveal quarterly revenues close to $5.2 billion, propelled by rising steel prices and increased shipment volumes. However, we predict that the company will report a loss of approximately $0.30 per share, as margins continue to be pressured by elevated energy and labor expenses. While stabilization in steel pricing and operational efficiencies may be helping to counteract inflationary pressures, profitability still faces challenges. Demand from the automotive and infrastructure sectors is bolstering volumes, but sustained margin recovery will rely on stronger steel prices and cost management in the coming quarters.
The company currently has a market capitalization of $6.9 billion. Revenue over the past twelve months reached $18 billion, and the company reported operational losses of $-1.6 billion and a net income of $-1.7 billion. Much will hinge on how the results compare to consensus and expectations; hence, understanding historical trends could improve the chances for event-driven traders.
There are two approaches to this: understand the historical probabilities and position yourself ahead of the earnings announcement, or analyze the correlation between immediate and medium-term returns after earnings and adjust your position accordingly post-announcement. That said, if you're looking for upside with less volatility than individual stocks, Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative â having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 105% since its inception.

Here are some insights on one-day (1D) post-earnings returns:
Additional information for 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns following earnings is summarized along with the statistics in the table below.
A relatively less risky strategy (though not beneficial if the correlation is weak) involves understanding the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns following earnings, identifying a pair with the highest correlation, and executing the appropriate strategy. For instance, if the correlation between 1D and 5D is the highest, a trader might go âlongâ for the next 5 days following a positive 1D post-earnings return. Below is some correlation data based on both 5-year and 3-year (more recent) histories. Note that the correlation 1D_5D indicates the correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and the subsequent 5D returns.
Discover more about Trefis RV strategy that has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000), yielding strong returns for investors. Additionally, if you're looking for upside with a smoother performance than an individual stock like Cleveland-Cliffs, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P and achieved greater than 105% returns since inception."

Last month, I made my big case for bringing loyalty back to corporate America. I argued that when employers make the first move toward loyalty â by treating their staff with care, respect, and honesty â employees would naturally reciprocate. Even in our hyper-mercenary age, I wrote, many of us still long for a loyal employer â and if we knew we wouldn't get burned for it, we'd be eager to be loyal in return. It's just that so many of us have been burned so badly that we've given up on that possibility.
There are many things that we as workers want, of course: free snacks, more PTO, a bigger raise. Where would loyalty rank on that list? Bosses juggle all those competing desires with limited budgets, so it's worth asking if loyalty is just a nice-to-have or something people truly value.
That's what my colleague Dan DeFrancesco, who writes our daily newsletter at Business Insider, wanted to find out. At the end of his write-up about my essay, he added a poll: Would you prefer to have a more loyal employer that pays less? Or a less loyal employer that pays more?
Given the cynicism that pervades the corporate workplace today, you might expect the certainty of cold, hard cash to beat something as fuzzy and intangible as loyalty. But the almighty dollar wasn't so powerful. Of the 170 of you who responded, nearly twice as many people chose loyalty over money.
There are a few ways to read this. Dan thought readers were responding aspirationally, aligning themselves with an idea that sounded virtuous, even though in reality they'd still choose money. (Dan is a skeptic!) Another possibility is that it's a fear response to the current white-collar recession. Amid rolling layoffs and hiring freezes, it may be that job security â the cornerstone of old-school loyalty â matters more to people than optimizing for the highest salary.
To me, the results of Dan's poll confirm what I've been hearing in my conversations with white-collar professionals over the last few years: that the desire for a workplace built on mutual care runs so deep that people would trade real money for it.
Take Paul, a software engineer I wrote about in my last piece. He works at a midsize family-run company and earns an OK salary, but knows there are better-paying jobs out there. Earlier this year, he interviewed for a role at a larger business that would have given him a $25,000 bump along with extras like a bonus and equity that his current employer doesn't offer. He devoted every free minute he had to prep for the coding tests, and went through six rounds of interviews over six weeks. Then, the recruiter went radio silent â and didn't even have the decency to reply to his several follow-ups.
Ghosting isn't all that unusual in corporate HR these days, but having been in the bubble of his family-run employer for the last few years, Paul was stunned. ""I had given so much and I didn't even get a response,"" he told me. ""That really stung."" He came out of the experience realizing two things: how hollow much of corporate America has become; and how good he has it with his current employer, which treats him with the kind of respect this other company didn't. When that same company posted a similar role recently, he didn't apply. Paul chose loyalty over money.
Many of you said you were craving that kind of mutually loyal workplace, too. ""I want to do great work,"" a lawyer in her early 40s told me. ""I work hard and aim for the highest quality deliverables. And I am not looking to stay at one company for life, but I do want to be treated as a human with pieces of my life other than work that must be given time and attention.""
I also heard from a surprising number of bosses who shared a similar belief in loyalty. Ronnie Thornley, a longtime senior manager in the telecom industry, said he always warned his teams not to expect loyalty from the company. But as a leader, he tried to practice loyalty himself, showing real care for each of his employees. When an employee had a sick kid, for example, he told them to go home. ""The work can wait,"" he would tell them. ""I understood if their personal lives were stable, then the time and performance at work would be taken care of."" His employees delivered great work as a result, and even though he's retired now, the relationships he built with them still mean something to him. ""Even after all these years of not having been with the company,"" he wrote, ""I'll still get invited to a group dinner or outing.""
Benji Steely-Boehlke, who spent years climbing the corporate ladder at several large companies, told me something similar. ""I know I made a difference in my employees' lives because I'm still in group texts with them, and they want to see me when we're in the same town,"" he said. When he was laid off in 2023, he decided against taking another job in an increasingly cutthroat corporate America and started his own company. He doesn't have any employees yet, but he's already thinking about how to build his business differently â from earmarking a generous employee engagement budget to pay for things that help staff form deeper relationships with each other, to, someday, offering low-interest loans to employees. ""Yes, I get you need to make money,"" he wrote. But, he added, ""corporate life has shifted and has just become greedy.""
The note that made me most hopeful came from Anthony Klotz, a professor of organizational behavior at the University College London. He recently created a new class called ""Sustainable Work Design,"" in which his master's students design jobs that work for both employers and employees given the reality of work today â employers, which have to adapt to fast-changing business needs, and employees, who want to perform well without burning out. And Anthony told me that he was impressed with how his 65 Gen Z students have embraced the challenge.
""Companies have an opportunity right now, as they redesign every job in the company to make room for robots, to also create space for the human side of work,"" he wrote. ""Many companies won't seize that opportunity, but my students give me some hope that many will.""
As a reporter, my job is to show you the world as it is â and the corporate workplace can be a dystopian place these days. But as a person, I'm unshakably hopeful. My goal in writing about loyalty was to show that the misery of contemporary white-collar work isn't inevitable: We have the choice to build a better workplace in the future. So I was encouraged to hear from so many of you who not only share that hope, but are already trying to figure out the nitty-gritty of how to get to that better future as employees, middle managers, and employers. It'll be the next generation of leaders like Klotz's Gen Z students â the very generation we love to criticize for their cynicism â who I hope will soon bring the new loyalty to life in the years ahead.
Being in conversation with all of you has changed the way I think about work. I got my start as an economics reporter, and perhaps because I spent so much time talking to economists, I thought of work the way they see it: a utilitarian exchange of labor for money. I saw myself and everyone else as these emotionless, salary-maximizing machines. Over time, I started to question that as both a reporter writing about work and as a worker myself. And that's in large part thanks to the hundreds, if not thousands, of conversations I've had with you over email, the phone, Zoom, and coffee in recent years, in which you shared incredibly thoughtful, heartbreaking, intimate stories about your experiences at work.
Today, I see work as a fundamentally emotional experience that goes beyond the market transaction underneath it, which I guess is to say it's just like anything else we do as human beings. Sure, money matters, often a lot â but so do many other things. And I think that's true whether we love our jobs or we hate them, or we exist somewhere in the messy space in between.
That's probably why so many of you wrote to me, and why, if given the choice, you said you'd pick loyalty over money â although, yes, we'd love to have both, and it's totally possible to have both. If you have more thoughts on this, I'd love to hear from you at aito@businessinsider.com.

Forbes Staff.
Twenty years ago Wexford, PA-based Muhlenkamp Fund was a perennial star on Forbes annual mutual fund Honor Roll list. Year-after-year it bested the S&P 500 using a low risk investment formula seeking large and small cap companies whose return on equity surpassed their price-earnings ratios and whose revenue growth was at least 10% a year.
It owned stocks like Ford, Alaska Airlines and Lockheed Martin. But in early 2000âs founder Ron Muhlenkamp began loading up on stocks of homebuilders like NVR and Beazer Homes, which appeared to be great bargains on paper, just as the housing bubble was filling up with irrational exuberance. Fund assets swelled from around $200 million in the late 1990s to more than $3 billion just prior to the Financial Crisis.
Thatâs when Muhlenkamp and other value stock managers hit a wall. The fundâs assets plummeted to $1 billion by the end of 2009. Over the next 15 years, an investment in Muhlenkamp Fund would have produced less than 9% per year while merely owning the increasingly tech-heavy S&P 500 would have produced a 12% annual return. The family fund continued to lose customers and by 2023 assets were $350 million.
Enter Ronâs son Jeffrey Muhlenkamp, who had spent 20 years in the army and retired as a Lieutenant Colonel in 2008 before joining his father in the business as an analyst.
âRonâs performance was extraordinary, but he ended up staying in those stocks too long and the financial crisis hit,â recalls Jeff, 59, who assumed control of his familyâs namesake fund in 2020.
Under Jeffâs skillful management, Muhlenkamp has emerged as one of the few actively managed mutual funds to beat the S&P 500 over the past five years, with an average annual return of 17.56% versus the S&Pâs 16.47%. Year-to-date the fund is up 14.3%, outpacing the broader indexâs 12.6%.
And while Jeff insists his investment philosophy is following in his now 81-year old fatherâs footsteps, dishing out quotes like âA good company at a high price is a bad investmentâ, his stock selection reflects a more pragmatic approach in terms of buying stocks that have the market winds at their back.
Currently his mutual fund has 19% of its $400 million in assets in gold stocks as fears of inflation and geopolitical instability have caused the price of gold to more than double in the last five years. For Muhlenkamp Fund, it began as a small position in the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD) which has since evolved into a large allocation to miners such as Newmont, Agnico Eagle and Royal Gold.
Gold, Muhlenkamp argues, has been the better portfolio hedge than Treasurys since Covid. Central banks, he notes, are buying roughly a thousand metric tons of gold a year, nearly a third of global production, while federal deficits keep widening. âCountries solve debt by devaluing currency,â he says. âIf you want to hide from that, you own gold.â
With gold up more than 40% this year, does Muhlenkamp worry about a gold bubble? Quite the opposite. Muhlenkamp thinks goldâs run could continue for years as debt and deficits weigh on the dollar.
âNobodyâs buying more [gold] mines because too many investors got burned by miners last time when prices fell,â he says, noting that miners tend to trade more volatility than the price of gold. He laughs recalling Costcoâs recent foray into selling gold bars online, under its Kirkland label, which only reinforced his bullish conviction: âThey sold like hot cakes.â
Other big momentum-friendly Muhlenkamp holdings include Microsoft, Berkshire Hathaway and Apple. Muhlenkamp says he has adapted his fatherâs value approach, and sees his firm firmly in the camp of converted value investors who buy growth stocksâwhen the math works. Muhlenkamp starts with screening for above-average return on shareholder equity and keeping an eye on inflation. âAs inflation goes up, people pay for return on equity,â says Jeff Muhlenkamp. âThis [ROE] strategy was a big leg up in the 1970sâ¦ Now itâs relevant again.â
Very important to Muhlenkamp version 2.0 is how management incentives are structured, and how buybacks are handled. Muhlenkamp is skeptical of executives who treat repurchases as routine. âIf a CEO says, âwe are just returning cash to shareholders,â Iâm usually less interested,â says Muhlenkamp. âYou bust your tail to make this cash and then you donât care how you invest it?â
He says the fundâs holdings of Microsoft and Apple, for example, were bought a decade ago not as tech darlings but as steady cash cows. âMicrosoft was 10â12x earnings with a 4% yieldâ¦ that was better than cash,â says Muhlenkamp. âThen cloud showed up and it became a growth stock againâweâve made 10x.â Apple, meanwhile, was partly trimmed ahead of its 2022 slide; Muhlenkamp calls it âa cash cow that still needs a new product cycle to grow again.â
The fundâs longest holding and one of its biggest winners is Rush Enterprises, an $8 billion (revenues) Texas-based truck dealership they first bought in 2001. âWe have made something like 45 times our money,â Jeff says. The appeal: a consolidation story with a high-margin service engine attached. âTheyâre only about 5% of new truck salesâstill a lot of runway,â he says. âIâll only sell if they quit doing what theyâve been doing.â
EQT, the Marcellus gas producer, is another of the fundâs conviction bets. Muhlenkamp likes the company because they are low cost producers, have disciplined management and will benefit from rising demand for cleaner energy. âThe Rice brothers remade the company,â he says. âWhen we ran the numbers, even if their free-cash projections were half right, it was a 15% yieldâ¦ that looked very attractive.â
What the fund doesnât ownâor is sellingâmatters just as much. âI think AI is somewhere between a boom or a bubble, and the difference is immaterial,â insists Muhlenkamp leaning into his value investor pedigree. âIt will be very difficult for future reality to match current expectations so I am very leery of stocks which have been driven by their AI exposure.â
In January fund exited Broadcom, an AI infrastructure company that recently struck a partnership with OpenAI, after a five-year run. âIt was at 25x sales. Has it doubled since we sold? Yes. Do I regret selling it? No,â insists Muhlenkamp. His only remaining AI-linked holding, MasTec, a $16 billion market-cap construction firm that builds data centers, is âon the worry list,â because capital-spending pledges from hyperscalers might not fully materialize. The rest of his portfolio has rotated toward manufacturing and healthcareâsectors still out of favor after a two-year industrial downturn.
To Muhlehkamp, AIâs parallels to past investment crazes are obvious. âCapital-spending booms always end in a bust,â he says, citing shale energy and housing as examples. âIf we get a bust, thatâs when the bargains will appear.â"

Bitfarms' 211% stock surge is driven by its strategic pivot from bitcoin mining to AI data centers, prompted by bitcoin halving's impact and AI's higher profitability. Investors now value these companies almost exclusively on their AI/HPC potential.Despite substantial AI infrastructure investments, Bitfarms faces significant challenges including huge losses, negative free cash flow, regulatory hurdles, and fierce competition from larger tech giants.
 
Shares of Bitfarm have risen 211% this year.
Why? Bitfarm â a Toronto-based bitcoin miner  â is doing something Nvidia figured out years ago. 
Bitfarm is shifting to operating high performance computing and artificial intelligence data centers because they are growing faster and have potentially higher profit than does bitcoin mining â the use of computers to solve difficult math problems that yield new bitcoins, about which I wrote in a March 2024 Forbes post. 
âInvestors are almost exclusively valuing Bitcoin miners for their HPC/AI opportunities at this point,â Needham & Co. analyst John Todaro told Bloomberg. âWe would say less than 10% of our conversations on miners are actually on Bitcoin and mining,â Todaro added.
Should you buy Bitfarm stock? The reasons to avoid this stock â huge losses, negative free cash flow, and significant competitive challenges â strike me as more compelling than the bull case â investors expect Bitfarm to catch the wave of money flowing towards AI data centers.
After recently converting a $300 million credit facility to build an HPC/AI data center in Pennsylvania, Bitfarms is bullish. âI am excited to announce the conversion of our debt facility to the project level, the acceleration of equipment orders, and development of our Panther Creek HPC/AI campus,â said Bitfarms CEO Ben Gagnon, according to Data Center Dynamics.
Macquarie â which provided the Panther Creek debt facility â expressed similar optimism. âWith robust energy, fiber infrastructure, and continued demand for data centers, Pennsylvania is quickly emerging as a new AI infrastructure hub,"" said Macquarie Groupâs commodities and global markets business managing director Joshua Stevens  in a statement.
âBitfarms is well-positioned to deliver state-of-the-art digital infrastructure for prospective clients in what is emerging as the premier HPC/AI data center hub in the US,â Stevens added.
Founded in 2017, Bitfarms currently has 15 bitcoin mining data centers operating across the United States, Canada, Paraguay, and Argentina. It recently sold a site in Paraguay to HIVE Digital.
The Bitfarms bet on AI is a reaction to a margin-squeezing development in the bitcoin industry known as halving. Due to its higher profitability investors are assigning higher valuations to companies that use data centers more to run AI workloads, than to mine bitcoin, noted Bloomberg. 
Halving cuts the supply of bitcoin and the reward for mining it. Last April, the bitcoin halving â which cut miner rewards from 6.25 to 3.125 bitcoin â has squeezed bitcoin mining profit margins due to ârising network difficulty and slowing transaction volumes,â Bloomberg reported.
Lower margins are motivating bitcoin miners to reallocate their power capacity away from adding bitcoin mining resources â dubbed the hashrate. âThe focus is shifting from âhow much hashrate can we addâ to âhow efficiently can we utilize our energy footprint,â â TheMinerMag analyst Wolfie Zhao told Bloomberg. 
Investors are rewarding the shift to AI data center resources. âThe revenue per megawatt and EBITDA margins are far higher for HPC and AI colocation than for mining,â said Todaro. 
With bitcoinâs volatility and halving risks, âcapital markets are rewarding AI-focused data centers with much higher multiples than traditional miners,â he added.
Investors like Bitfarmsâ big bets on this wave. Its shares have recently surged 19.5% after announcing the allocation of $800 million to capture this opportunity. Last week, Bitfarms issued $500 million in convertible senior notes due 2031 to fund its HPC/AI transition in addition to the $300 million financing facility for Panther Creek, noted Yahoo! Finance.
The Bitfarm bear case strikes me as more compelling. Here are three reasons to avoid betting on the companyâs stock.
Bitfarms stock could be somewhat overvalued. Six Wall Street analysts who cover the company set an average price target of $4.67 â suggesting the shares are 12% overvalued. according to TipRanks.
I agree with an analyst who rates Bitfarms a hold. âThe stock might just keep rising due to speculative investing,â noted SeekingAlphaâs Emanuel Nemec. 
âAs such, I would not dare to short this stock or do it with a small amount and hold it until the current mania wears off, which at some point certainly will happen. But as Warren Buffett said, âMarkets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.â â Nemec added."

Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist and the likely next mayor of New York City, believes the solution to Gotham's perpetual housing crisis is stringent price controls and massive government subsidies. His flair for making wonky policy fun and relatable helps to explain his popularity. In a TikTok video shot on the beach at Coney Island in January, Mamdani told viewers, ""I'm freezingâ¦your rent,"" before joyfully rushing into the frigid water in a suit and tie. The video goes on to elaborate on his popular call to halt rent increases for roughly a million regulated units.
What Mamdani doesn't understand (or chooses to ignore) is the extent to which the Big Apple's housing market is already drowning under the government's outsized role in setting rents, subsidizing construction, and serving as landlord for the roughly half a million New Yorkers who live in public housing.
New York housing is more socialist than not, which is why the sector has all the familiar characteristics of collectivism and central planning: rampant mismanagement, decay of public assets, misuse of scarce resources, and privilege for the select few.
Mamdani wants to extend this socialist-style regime by freezing regulated rents and implementing a $100 billion program to build 200,000 new, publicly subsidized, rent-regulated housing units. He details both ideas in the plan he calls Housing by and for New York.
Rent regulation and public housing have been around in New York in different forms for over a century, and they are policy disasters. They are the underlying cause of the city's perennial housing ""crisis.""
With public housing, a local housing authority owns and manages apartment buildings. New York's program, initiated by Mayor Fiorello La Guardia in the 1930s, is by far the nation's largest public housing system, providing shelter to an estimated 520,000 residents on 335 sites.
These buildings are falling apart, with an estimated $78 billion repair backlog, including ""non-functioning smoke detectors, antiquated electrical components, damaged interiors, missing child guardsâ¦deteriorated roofs, deteriorated pumps, and leaking pipes,"" according to a recent report. The system for making repairs in New York public housing is rife with corruption. Heat and hot water service are routinely interrupted. The elevators, which are crucial in multistory buildings housing elderly residents, are constantly breaking down.
When public housing was created, it was assumed that the residents would be two-income, working families whose rents would cover upkeep. That plan failed as stable families opted for home-ownership. Today, only 2 percent of New York public housing households include two adults with children, and just a third of households report income from wages.
The perverse incentives of public housing help explain why the city is perennially plagued by shortages. According to data from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), fully 30 percent of the city's public housing residents are ""overhoused,"" meaning single adults are living in 3- or 4-bedroom apartments. About 10 percent of residents have lived in their units for more than 40 years.
This problem also applies to rent-regulated units: Artificially cheap rents mean tenants don't vacate after their kids grow up and move out, leading to inefficient use of a limited stock.
When faced with high property taxes and underutilized space, on the other hand, the older owners of private homes often sell and downsize, making way for newcomers. This cycle, driven by market incentives, creates healthy and dynamic communities.
The ""affordable housing"" program championed by Mamdani will likely take the form of new private apartment buildings setting aside units for lower-income families, whose rents are subsidized by the federal government. These programs require developers to navigate extensive red tape, which adds cost and slows housing production. The system allocates units via lottery, so it's based on luck.
Similarly, rent-regulated units in Manhattan go to tenants lucky enough to get them, or, in some cases, inherit them from their parents or grandparents. Since New York lawmakers have made it so hard to evict tenants for nonpayment of rent, landlords are incentivized to pick high-earners to inhabit this scarce resource.
As mayor, Mamdani would select the members of the Rent Guidelines Board, which sets price increases on nearly 1 million apartments. According to Census data, turnover in rent-regulated units is half that of market-rate units, which is one of the reasons the city's overall turnover is 46 percent lower than the national average.
Suppose Mamdani wins and his appointees do his bidding, freezing the rent. In that case, thousands of small property owners, who are disproportionately minorities and striving immigrants, will have their rent rolls squeezed by a regulatory tourniquet. Landlords are widely demonized, but it's not an enviable job. A 99-year-old owner in the Washington Heights neighborhood was beaten savagely and robbed recently by someone pretending to meet to pay the rent in cash.
The tourniquet is already squeezing, thanks to a 2019 law that made New York's rent regulation laws far more stringent. Some 200,000 rent-regulated apartments, many in need of ongoing maintenance, don't generate enough income to cover basic operating expenses, according to Mark Willis of New York University's Furman Center. He also noted that ""such rent shortfalls are likely to continue to grow over time, potentially exponentially, jeopardizing the long-run economic sustainability of these properties.""
Price controls explain why New York is experiencing what I've called ""shabbification."" Buried in a table in the New York City's May 2022 Census Bureau Housing and Vacancy Survey is the fact that a third of rent-regulated units have rodents, which is nearly twice the rate of unregulated apartments. They also experience twice as many leaks, three times as many heating breakdowns, three times as many instances of mold, and twice as many toilet and elevator breakdowns.
About 23 percent of tenants in rent-stabilized units have lived in their apartments 20 years or more, compared to just 7 percent in unregulated units, according to a Furman Center study. More than twice as many rent-regulated residents are over age 65, and these units have fewer residents per household on average. In other words, rent regulation is enabling older New Yorkers, regardless of income, to age in place at artificially low rents.
Newcomers with ambition and creativityâbut no trust fundâare locked out of the market.
A Mamdani rent freeze could turn the deterioration of the regulated housing stock into a full-blown crisis. Small owners, lacking financial reserves, will face rising property taxes and insurance costs. The prospect of abandonment could have echoes of the 1970s, when ""the Bronx"" was famously ""burning"" because desperate owners turned to arson to collect federally-backed insurance payouts that were worth more than their buildings.
The story of how the South Bronx came to resemble post-World War II Dresden is captured in a new book called Born in Flames: The Business of Arson and the Remaking of the American City by Temple University historian Bench Ansfield. Though it got a glowing review in The New York Times, the book's analysis is worthy of parody.Â 
Ansfield correctly blames a 1968 federal program called Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) for making Bronx buildings ""most valuable after they went up in flames."" In a free market, insurance companies wouldn't have underwritten nearly worthless structures at the center of an arson epidemic. But federal bureaucrats were risking other people's money, so they didn't care. The program incentivized landlords to burn down their buildings ""not necessarily out of malice but out of calculated interest."" In a bizarro twist, Ansfield characterizes this unintended consequence of government intervention as ""a market-based financial remedy,"" referring to the arson wave as ""a free market slum clearance program.""Â Â 
The author also casually dismisses another major factor in this tragic tale: The FAIR program set the borough ablaze, but it was another ill-conceived government intervention that turned these structures into ready tinder by depleting their value: rent regulation. Today's landlords aren't about to set their properties aflame, but the 2019 law has incentivized them to remove unprofitable units from the market and to allow their buildings to fall into disrepair.
How is it that a socialist like Mamdani takes stock of the New York City housing market's many problems and blames market failure? It's already the nation's most regulated housing market, with the largest stock of government-owned and subsidized housing in the country. Mamdani sees the solution as more of the same.
Rent regulation has turned New York into a Hunger Games version of musical chairs. When the record stops, grab the nearest seat and hang on. If Mamdani wins, the rickety wooden legs might collapse to the ground.

Sports fans are warming to ESPN's streaming-focused app, but the real question is if they'll stick around once football season winds down.
ESPN's streaming services generated an estimated 2.1 million subscribers in the US from August 21 through September, subscription data firm Antenna said on Monday.
About 1.2 million, or 57%, of those signups were for the full version of ESPN, which the sports network made available outside of the pay-TV bundle for the first time ever for $30 a month. The rest were for ESPN Select (formerly ESPN+), which has a smaller subset of live sports, some original shows, and ESPN's film library, including its ""30 for 30"" documentary series.
ESPN's direct-to-consumer service is on pace to exceed analysts' estimates. Wells Fargo's Steven Cahall predicted that stand-alone ESPN would score 1.5 million to 2 million subscribers by year's end, with Wolfe Research's Peter Supino calling for 1.75 million and Lightshed's Rich Greenfield estimating 2 million in that span. ESPN's stand-alone service is nearing those targets in just over a month, with the NBA and college basketball seasons right around the corner.
However, it may be too soon to say that ESPN has solved streaming.
ESPN's new subscription service will face a formidable test in January, when the NFL and college football seasons wind down. It's way easier to cancel streaming services than cable, as YouTube TV has learned the hard way by shedding subscribers after the end of the football season.
If ESPN's cord-cutter-friendly service can't maintain its momentum, it might not solve the cable network's existential pay-TV problem after all.
An ESPN spokesperson declined to comment for this story.
ESPN isn't alone in making its content available outside the pay-TV bundle.
TV networks like CNN and Fox are also going the direct-to-consumer route. CNN just unveiled its $7 a month CNN All Access launching this month, and Fox One, Fox's new $20 streamer, had 1.1 million signups from August 21 through September, according to Antenna's estimates. Plus, streamers like Peacock and Paramount+ air live sports from NBC and CBS, respectively.
But TV networks like ESPN and Fox don't want to completely undermine the pay-TV bundle, which is still quite lucrative. Basic cable packages typically go for $90 or more a month, while YouTube TV costs a bit less at $83, and DirecTV's skinny sports bundle is $70.
The beauty of traditional bundles is that networks get paid for each pay-TV subscriber â even if those viewers never watch their channels. They also don't have to market those packages. Plus, sports fans can see most of the games in one place.
""The bundle is still the best value for sports fans,"" Fox Sports CEO Eric Shanks said at a Front Office Sports conference in September.
Still, ESPN knows it needs a way to directly reach consumers, especially young audiences who didn't grow up paying for a big TV bundle.
ESPN is trying to thread the needle by going direct-to-consumer, without giving up on bundling, which helps prevent cancellations.
The sports network is offering several bundling options, like stand-alone ESPN and Fox One for $40 a month. For that same price, subscribers could instead get ESPN with NFL+, which has the highlights channel RedZone, along with the ad versions of Disney+ and Hulu.
Those who'd rather pay $30 can get ESPN with Disney+ and Hulu with ads for free for the first year. (After 12 months, that bundle will cost $36 a month, while the ad-free version is $45.)
Neither ESPN nor Fox is saying how many subscribers they're expecting in the long term.
""I'm not going to lie to you and say we know exactly where this is exactly going to land,"" Fox One head Pete Distad said of his streamer's subscriber count at its launch event in August.

After years of working remotely for companies in North America, I landed a remote role as the head of growth at a European creator tech company in January. I wanted to move back into sales and join a tech company, and this role checked both of those boxes.
My original team operates almost entirely out of North America, but the rest of the company operates on Central European Time. I was allowed to work 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Eastern, but all the other team leads live in Europe.
After about two weeks, I realized that working a normal 9-5 schedule left me little time to work with them, build key stakeholder relationships, and ensure I was bringing my best to the role, so I switched my schedule from 5 a.m. to 2 p.m. Eastern.
Shifting my schedule from a 6 a.m. to a 4:30 a.m. wakeup wasn't a big deal. The first month and a half was exhausting, but I adjusted. I'm in bed by 9 p.m. most nights.
In August, I was promoted to head of plus (professional services), and I now direct the work of four teams, three of which are based mostly in Europe. I'm glad I switched schedules when I first joined, as I believe it made my professional advancement easier.
The difference in my mornings is in how I spend my time. Before I started work at 5, I'd often spend my morning scrolling or have an extra leisurely start, and I'd get nothing productive done. Now, I'm often in a meeting at the beginning of my day or coworking with another team lead.
About an hour before my teams in North America log on, I review everyone's calendars so I know what they have going on in their day and can shift work around so nobody is overburdened. I also review our active deals so I can help things close and ensure we hit or exceed our weekly target.
By the time we have our morning team huddle at 9:30 a.m., I've solved problems, set a clear road map for the day, and done most of my own stuff so I can be available to them for whatever they need.
I stop working on work things somewhere between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. most days. I do my best to leave at 2 p.m., but management is never a 40-hour-a-week job.
I keep my Slack open in case my team has emergency questions. I get maybe two or three messages a day after 2 p.m., and it takes me less than five minutes to get to whatever the team's asking me for, so I really don't mind having to hop back in briefly.
I wasn't sure how working for a predominantly European company would go, as most of what I knew about work culture in Europe came from TV, but it's been overwhelmingly positive. My colleagues have dedicated lunch breaks, so I started taking one for the first time. It's made my back-half-of-the-day decision-making so much sharper.
The company has menstrual leave and a flexible sick days policy, so I also never feel the pressure to show up if I'm not well. At North American companies I've worked for, I was expected to do calls the day after a hip replacement while still in the hospital and work through having COVID-19.
Many of my colleagues take their vacation days without logging into work at all. I always had to leave a method of communication at North American companies, and people reached out to me frequently. I'm still not as chill about disconnecting, but I did spend two weeks in Paris and only checked Slack and email twice, which I consider a win.
On occasion, I also travel for work. I went to the Berlin headquarters in September to work with a few colleagues, so I had the joy of seeing a bit of a new city, collecting a stamp on my passport, and racking up significant airline miles. I love to travel, so this is a huge perk of the job.
My full-time job is just one of my income streams. I have a six-figure revenue stream in career coaching and fractional C-level AI consulting services. In the current market, I'm busy reviewing and rewriting rÃ©sumÃ©s and LinkedIn profiles, helping out-of-work job seekers prep for interviews, and helping current employees set themselves up for a promotion in the next fiscal year.
I write for publications about careers, leadership, AI, and travel, and I'm a coach in a program that helps people grow their LinkedIn following with strategic content. I also occasionally do B2B LinkedIn brand deals to promote products to my 100,000-person audience.
When I worked from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., I used to work 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. on my other income streams, which meant my weekends were my only free time.
Now, I work from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. on those revenue streams. My evenings are mine again, and I can give my clients and my audience my best every day.

69,2025-10-20,"Travelers from all over visit the chain's larger-than-life convenience stores to get some fuel, use a clean bathroom, grab a bite to eat and shop for souvenirs.
The Texas-based Buc-ee's chain of travel centers has 54 locations in the United States. While locations are primarily in the South, Colorado did get its first Buc-ee's on March 18, 2024, in Johnstown. A second Colorado location was proposed to open in Palmer Lake, but the project site's annexation was rejected by the El Paso County town's planning commission in September.
On Oct. 14, all seven members of Pueblo City Council voted in favor of a resolution to market the City of Pueblo as an alternative location for the chain's second Colorado location.
""Buc-ee's, a nationally recognized travel center brand, has demonstrated a proven track record of investing in communities through significant capital investment, creation of hundreds of quality jobs, collection of local sales tax revenues and provision of services to both residents and travelers,"" part of the approved resolution reads.
The resolution also mentions ""local opposition"" to Buc-ee's presence in Palmer Lake and that the City of Pueblo has a desire to demonstrate a ""willingness to welcome new business opportunities.""
With approval of the resolution, council agreed to share its text with the Greater Pueblo Chamber of Commerce, Pueblo Economic Development Corporation and Pueblo Urban Renewal Authority.
While presenting the resolution at the Oct. 14 regular council meeting, Director of Public Works Andrew Hayes told council that two potential locations for a Buc-ee's come to mind. One potential location is north of American Furniture Warehouse, 4711 Dillon Dr., between Interstate 25 exits 104 and 102. The other potential location Hayes mentioned is near an incoming QuikTrip location on the south side.
""If Buc-ee's leadership was open to an alternative Colorado location, Pueblo offers land availability, workforce and a clear business-friendly process to move from concept to construction responsibly,"" Hayes said.
Following Hayes' presentation, Pueblo City Councilman Dennis Flores said that the resolution to invite Buc-ee's to Pueblo is one that ""we should all be supporting"" and that the city should be ""proactive"" in its efforts moving forward.
""We should have an open for business sign at each location,"" Flores said. ""This is a great resolution.""

The shares, sold in a private placement in September at $6.881 each, has become eligible for sale earlier than scheduled, the firm said in a Monday press release. HSDT shares have tumbled to around $6.50 following a steep three-session decline that wiped nearly 60% from its market value, including a 17% drop on Monday.
""'Ripping off the band-aid' is the approach we are confidently taking, while many other DATs are choosing to stall,"" the company posted on X on Monday.

Make no mistake about it. t, one thatâs ever worsening. Trouble is, we donât have the latest monthly figures (Septemberâs Jobs Report) from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, on which we confidently rely. And until the government reopens, we wonât know just how bad things are. But we can extrapolate from recent data, and what see is far from a walk in the park. 
For instance, the 88,000 net jobs created in the four months prior, didnât amount to a single average month under the previous administration. And with increasing layoffs in the government sector, plus tariffs being tossed around all over the place, itâs reasonable to assume that trendline is not improving. On the contrary.
So when we say âhope for the best and prepare for the worstâ what does that mean? Here are the four fundamental things to do in girding for a down market.

Itâs hard to beat the S&P 500. Its heavy allocation to the large-cap technology companies driving the artificial intelligence boom seems to make new highs every week. If your core equity allocation is to the S&P 500, you can take comfort in knowing that you have not missed out on the equity rally over the last few years.
However, many S&P 500 investors are nervous about lofty valuations and whether the 40% concentration in just ten holdings provides adequate diversification. One strategy is to add exposure to more value-oriented, less expensive segments of the market that tend to hold up better when the tide shifts. Defensive investors should consider adding consumer staples stocks to their portfolio.
Over the past year, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP) has significantly underperformed the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), with a total return of -0.7% versus 15.5% for the S&P 500. In a market dominated by optimism, growth, and AI enthusiasm, defensive sectors like consumer staples have been left behind.
The stocks in XLP are household names. Walmart, Costco, Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola comprise approximately 35% of the portfolio. Regardless of what happens to technology stocks or the overall economy, these companies should still see demand for their products.
Using 2022 as a template, when the total return for the S&P 500 was -18.5%, the consumer staples sector fell less than 1%. Historically, investors tend to flock to value and quality stocks like those in the staples sector when they get scared.
Earlier in the year, staples benefited from a bid for safety as investors hedged against tariff-related volatility. But as those fears faded and risk appetite returned, capital rotated into cyclical and high-growth sectors. With momentum favoring growth stocks, investors have had little incentive to own anything defensive in their portfolio.
Fundamentals in the consumer staples sector have not helped. Elevated inflation has squeezed input costs and pressured margins, and tariff uncertainty continues to hang over global supply chains. Consumer staples, alongside energy and materials, were one of only three U.S. sectors with negative year-over-year earnings growth last quarter.
However, that underperformance has created an opportunity. Aside from the defensive qualities, staples look more interesting from a relative-value perspective. XLP trades at roughly 20 times forward earnings and offers a 2.7% dividend yield, more than double that of the S&P 500. The sector is trading at its lowest relative valuation in the past five years compared to the market.
Several catalysts could push investors back toward defensive sectors. A valuation correction in mega-cap tech, economic weakness stemming from tariff escalation, and the impact of a prolonged government shutdown could all trigger a move into staples. If inflation stays moderate and input costs ease, margins for consumer goods producers should improve, helping position the sector for relative outperformance even if the broader market stalls.
Adding more diversification to S&P 500 exposure has not paid off during the latest bull market run. But if you are nervous about the broader market's ability to sustain its outperformance, the setup for consumer staples is compelling. Staples may not lead the next bull market, but they may protect your portfolio if stocks move in the opposite direction."

On Friday, Ethereum Foundation Researcher Dankrad Feist announced he will be joining the stablecoin-focused blockchain startup Tempo, which was incubated via a partnership between fintech giant Stripe and crypto investment firm Paradigm. In response, some of the crypto purists on social media, most notably and understandably those who build on Ethereum, shared their disappointment, while others simply saw it as a sign of the times in terms of where the industry is headed more generally.
Dankrad leaving Ethereum is a terrible look for open-source vs. corporate blockchains.
Huge L for the entire community tbh
â Andy (@ayyyeandy) October 17, 2025

The reaction to this recent move by Feist is an illustration of the greater cultural divide that has been growing in crypto over the past few years as more of this technology is built around increasingly centralized vectors of control. While Satoshi NakamotoÃ¢ÂÂs original Bitcoin whitepaper and other early writings discussed the need for a new system built on Ã¢ÂÂcryptographic proof instead of trustÃ¢ÂÂ and the problems with traditional systems being related to Ã¢ÂÂall the trust thatÃ¢ÂÂs required to make it work,Ã¢ÂÂ much of the more recent activity in crypto has involved centrally-issued stablecoins as poker chips in a meme coin casino.
Much of the growth around crypto networks like Ethereum has been centered around centralized stablecoins, which operated in somewhat of a legal grey area in the U.S. prior to the passage of the GENIUS Act earlier this year. With greater regulatory clarity established around these digital dollars, there has been an increase in various developments around so-called Ã¢ÂÂstablechains,Ã¢ÂÂ which are focused on these bank-backed dollar tokens rather than crypto-native, permissionless assets.
A fundamental problem with ETH valuation is that ethereum's primary uses cases are largely external to ETH's market value.  Ethereum can be very useful, its apps can garner great revenue, and ETH can still be low price â or vice versa â there is little link between them.  OTOH,Ã¢ÂÂ¦

Circle and Tether are the two largest stablecoin issuers via their respective USDC and USDT tokens. Earlier this year, Circle announced the creation of their own layer-one blockchain called Arc. Additionally, Tether and its affiliates have supported the development of at least two blockchains where USDT is the native gas token, namely Stable and Plasma.
More well-known players in the fintech industry are also getting involved, with Coinbase, Stripe (Tempo), PayPal, and Robinhood all either announcing or already having launched their own blockchain platforms or other expansions into the crypto market. Google Cloud and Cloudflare also have their own blockchain offerings at different stages of development that are focused on payments for artificial intelligence agents. Some of these platforms are being built as secondary layers on top of Ethereum, while others are completely separate blockchain networks.
As big tech giants and other notable players get involved in building out their own blockchain networks where they can have more control and extract more value, the cypherpunk values Satoshi wanted to infuse into Bitcoin, such as privacy and censorship resistance, have struggled to gain the hearts and minds of the general public. Sure, the bitcoin price recently hit a new all-time high once again (before subsequently dropping more than 15%); however, much of the recent bull run has been built around centralized, regulated financial products such as the publicly-traded exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from the likes of BlackRock and bitcoin treasury companies such as Strategy.
There are still pockets of activity in crypto that are relatively faithful to the Satoshi vision. Not all use cases reintroduce trusted third parties by building everything around centralized stablecoins or throw away privacy by putting too much financial data on public blockchains. This is becoming an increasingly smaller percentage of overall activity, however, when compared to speculation on dubious token offerings or further empowering financial institutions with new technology that allows them to avoid strict anti-money laundering regulations as long as they put their customers on a database they call a blockchain.
Bitcoin itself has remained somewhat resistant to corporate influence at the protocol level, as shown by the resolution of its internal block size warÃÂ back in 2017. However, EthereumÃ¢ÂÂs reliance on stablecoins is becoming an increasingly hard-to-ignore issue that is worth watching, as the issuers of these tokens have an incentive to use their centralized point of control to extract as much value as possible from this technology.
As seen by the recent Ã¢ÂÂstablechainÃ¢ÂÂ phenomenon, this may include a desire to cut the open Ethereum network out of the picture entirely. Contrastly, BitcoinÃ¢ÂÂs main problematic point of centralization in terms of third-party custodians still requires those custodians to use the Bitcoin network.
While people are still able to use these technologies in the permissionless, non-custodial manner Satoshi originally intended, the crypto industry as a whole is increasingly turning into a way for centralized financial entities to empower themselves rather than individual users.

85,2025-10-20,"This article is part of Digidayâs coverage of its Digiday Media Buying Summit. More from the series â
Itâs difficult to contextualize how marketers are strategizing for next year as this yearâs books close without acknowledging these unprecedented times âÂ or these emotionally charged times âÂ or whatever âbrand safeâ language PR teams are pushing to say that the news cycle and unstable tariff policies have deeply affected media buying.
Tim Ringel, global CEO of Meet the People, a collective of agencies, called out the issue on stage at Digidayâs Media Buying Summit in Phoenix last week, conceding that it was a year of âtariffs and all the beautiful things the world has thrown at us.â
âA single person âÂ not to name names â can post something on their own social network and the stock market plummets,â Ringel said. âAnd a day later, that changes again. How do you operate in an environment like this as a brand? You have to be really careful.
âWe see a direct correlation between how many deals come in in a week â on days where the government is still or nothing happens that destroys the world â or the government does something that could destroy the world. There is an immediate correlation between those numbers.â
Both in April, when Trump announced a suspension to certain tariffs, and August when they went into effect, were a âdisaster,â Ringel said, who previously in the discussion onstage named a client list of over 250 that included Nespresso, Google, IBM and Moet Hennessy. That client roster cuts across categories including CPG, healthcare and financial services.Â 
CPG and retail is âway more exposed,â Ringel said. âEven in Q4 where you have to own the holidays theyâre [marketers are] still being a little bit cagey about it.â Notably, CPG has been bullish on spend as a means to make up for the tariff uncertainty.
During the Summitâs Town Hall event, in which agency attendees were asked to anonymously provide challenges theyâre seeing, only one submission was related to the charged news cycle: âtariffs and volatile market conditions.â
Itâs a critical time to duck away from the news âÂ as publishers face challenging traffic referral losses both from social media platforms and AI. But the topic of the news cycle, and brand safety and the tools that could solve for them, all took on new life under Chatham House Rules. For one who contributed to the conversation, the issue of tariffs landed soundly in the topic of education.
âEvery time someone talks about tariffs you see a massive spike or decrease in performance,â one attendee said, particularly in categories like manufacturing.
They added that theyâve had to educate clients on these trends, and communicate that to sales teams. âIt is a huge problem trying to say, âHey, these market problems are actually affecting performance, both for good or bad.â But sales didnât want to hear that. They just want to hear, âHey, we want results,â which is the huge issue.â
âData helps,â they added.
Agency folk tell of over reliance on the AIâs tools, and a face-value acceptance of information and data that in actuality requires human oversight to ensure accuracy

86,2025-10-20,"BlackRock debuted a bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) on the London Stock Exchange on Monday, one of a number of similar offerings that started trading after the Financial Conduct Authority ended a ban on retail investment imposed in 2021.
In addition to the iShares Bitcoin ETP trading under the ticker IB1T, investors also gained access to products from companies including 21Shares, WisdomTree and Bitwise, which allow retail investors to buy exposure to bitcoin through a regulated market without needing to hold the cryptocurrency directly.
BlackRock's product is already available elsewhere in Europe, having been listed on Xetra, Euronext Amsterdam and Euronext Paris in late March according to the BlackRockâs page for the product.
Switzerland-based 21Shares introduced four of its flagship crypto ETNs. These include its bitcoin (ABTC) and ether (AETH) staking products, as well as two lower-fee ""Coreâ offerings, CBTC and ETHC, with management fees of 0.10%.
âTodayâs launch represents a landmark step for the U.K. market and for everyday investors who, for years, have been excluded from regulated crypto products,â 21Shares CEO Russel Barlow said in an emailed press release. Ending the ban âbegins to level the playing field with Europe.â
The WisdomTree Physical Bitcoin and WisdomTree Physical Ethereum ETPs, which were previously available only to wealthy investors, are expected to be available through a range of U.K.-regulated investment platforms starting this week, the company said.
Bitwise listed four ETPs on the LSE, two each tracking BTC and ETH. The firm said on Monday it was reducing the management fee of its Core Bitcoin ETP (BTC1) from 20 basis points to 5 bps for the next six months. 
BlackRock, which manages over $13 trillion in assets globally, has seen strong growth in its crypto-focused products. Its flagship bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), has $85.5 billion in net assets according to SoSoValue data. This makes it the largest spot bitcoin ETF, followed by Fidelityâs FBTC, which has $21.9 billion in net assets.
UPDATE (Oct. 20, 12:06 UTC): Adds listings by 21Shares, WisdomTree and Bitwise starting in first paragraph.

The Omoda 3 has been hotly anticipated, with one YouTube channel even describing it as a âbaby Lamborghiniâ after it was unveiled in China in April. However, now the car has been more formally launched as part of parent company Cheryâs 2025 User Summit, it has been renamed as the Omoda 4 â something that even took UK Omoda staff by surprise. I asked Shawn Xu Vice, President of Chery International and CEO of OMODA&JAECOO about the name change and how the new car would fit into the companyâs expanding and increasingly successful lineup.
Although Chery has been manufacturing cars since the Fulwin in 1999, the Omoda brand is relatively new. âOmoda was established less than three years ago,â says Xu. âThe brand has only been in the UK for a year. But our performance is good.â He claims Omoda and Jaecoo together make the fastest-growing car brand in the world, although other Chinese brands such as XPENG and BYD have also seen massive expansion in 2025 and might question that statement.
The Omoda 5 and E5 have been selling well in Europe, though, achieving as many as 50,000 combined sales in the EU so far this year. In the UK alone, up to July these sibling models (the E5 is the electric version of the 5) shifted 11,000 units, with the Omoda 5 the bestselling car in Greater London in July 2025. Both Omoda and Jaecoo have been doing well in the UK. In Great Britain, the Jaecoo 7 was the fourth bestselling car for September 2025, with 6,489 sales. Thatâs impressive when you consider it beat familiar favorites like the Hyundai Tucson and Volkswagen Golf.
âFrom the beginning we designed to target young people,â says Xu. âThe market for young people has very rapid growth. They want to be unique.â Xu argues that the strategy behind Omoda and Jaecoo was to deliver something a bit different for the younger car buyer, although itâs more likely that the attractive price for decent quality and features has been the most significant factor. This is the recipe of the recently released Jaecoo E5, which provides a Range Rover Evoque vibe for as little as Â£27,505 ($37,000).
With all the attention already for the Omoda 3, itâs still a surprise that it has now been renamed the 4, implying that there will be greater room for smaller Omoda cars in the future. Xu implies that the change came from public feedback. âThe Omoda 4 was first unveiled in April,â he says. âAt that time, we said Omoda 3, and we still havenât closed the door to make a car based on what our customers want. Our model 4 still needs 10 months to one year before production.â
The input from customers is something that Chery has been making central to its branding strategy, calling it âco-creationâ and âco-definitionâ and using the slightly no-grammatical slogan âWith Creating With Loveâ. âOur main purpose right now is to ask journalists and potential customers who have come here to tell us what they do and donât like it,â says Xu. âWith this kind of information, we can improve ourselves. During the last half year, after we first unveiled Omoda 3, we got so much attention and feedback. This told us the Omoda 3 name is probably not suitable for this car. Omoda 4 is better, because the car more than 4.4 meters long. We heard the voice of our customers, so we made some adaptations.â
The Omoda 3 was actually longer than the existing Omoda 5, but with the same wheelbase, so the naming didnât entirely make sense. The wheelbase has now been stretched a little to make the Omoda 4, providing more internal space. Thereâs a slightly bigger Omoda 5 facelift on the roadmap for the second half of 2026, too. This will inherit some of the design cues of the Omoda 4, which the company has dubbed âCyber Mechaâ, referring to an angular, aggressive and somewhat robotic appearance. This is what led some to liken the car to a miniâLamborghini Urus or Lotus Eletre.
The size makes the Omoda 4 better suited to the export market than the local Chinese one. âThe UK and Europe still have very large demand for the small compact car,â argues Xu. âThe Chinese market needs big cars.â This has been evident for a while. European manufacturers have been releasing longer-wheelbase âLâ versions of their models exclusively for the Chinese market for over a decade. The BMW iX3 Neue Klasse, for example, will have an iX3L version exclusively in China, and you will see strange stretched E-class Mercedes versions that arenât available in Europe on the streets of Chinese cities, too. Thereâs even a long wheelbase C-class Mercedes manufactured for China.
Chery is unusual among Chinese car companies in that it focuses much more heavily on the export market, taking over from SAIC as Chinaâs biggest car exporter from 2023 onwards. Chery exported 1.14 million cars in 2024 and has already sold 1.35 million cars outside China so far in 2025. While many Chinese automakers are having to think about external markets due to production overcapacity, Chery has been doing this for years, with strong sales in South America and South Africa for its TIGGO range, for example. The company also climbed 152 places in the latest Fortune 500 listing to reach 233rd place.
With many developing countries having younger populations than the developed world, the Omoda and Jaecoo focus on attracting this demographic seems sensible. âWhen we study young people, they want something different,â argues Xu. âYoung people like something fashionable and with lots of feeling.â The Chery drivetrain choices are also flexible, giving plenty of customer options. The Omoda 4 will be available with internal combustion, hybrid and BEV variants, although this will vary by region.
Beyond the angular, sci-fi looks of the base car, Omoda also wants to offer a version that appeals to the more enthusiastic young buyer. âThis car is not just for commuting from home to office,â says Xu. âItâs for lifestyle, so there will be an Ultra version with a sport kit.â Images of this were shown at the Omoda 4 launch, with a large rear spoiler.
However, no details were given about what either this version or the base models would have as drivetrain options at launch. The platform will be shared with the Omoda 5, 7 and 9, but thatâs a very flexible system that can accommodate a wide variety of options. Judging by the surprise name change from 3 to 4, itâs also probably subject to last-minute change even if some options have been considered already. The car is expected in the second half of 2026, with some guessing October, but no announcements have been made.
Another topic Xu wouldnât comment on was whether Chery would ever expand its Omoda 4 export business to the USA. With the huge tariffs and volatility of importing into this country right now, this is understandable. But looking at the massive growth Chery is already enjoying, the company is doing very nicely without needing the US market. That could be a cherry on top for Chery if and when the possibility opens up, but it clearly isnât essential for success."

 Stock futures are rising this morning as investors await a slew of earnings reports, key inflation data and updates on trade negotiations in the coming days;Â  Amazon Web Services experienced disruptions that created service issues for several major websites; Appleâs (AAPL) iPhone 17 model outsold the prior model in the U.S. and China during its first ten days on the market; proxy firm Institutional Shareholder Services advised Tesla (TSLA) shareholders to reject a proposed pay package for CEO Elon Musk; and Cooper Companies (COO) stock is rising on news activist investor Jana had built a stake in the medical device maker. Here's what you need to know today.

 Stock futures are gaining ground at the start of of a busy week for corporate earnings, after major indexes rose last week despite a volatile stretch of trading fueled by banking sector worries and trade-related tensions. Investors are awaiting further developments on the trade front and awaiting the scheduled release on Wednesday of inflation data that will factor into the Federal Reserve's upcoming decision on interest rates. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.2% recently, while those linked to the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-focussed Nasdaq added 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively. Gold futures were up nearly 2% at $4,295 an ounce, rebounding from a downturn on Friday that followed a string of record highs. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) was trading near $111,000, after dropping below $104,000 on Friday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on an array of consumer loans, held steady at 4.01%.

 Several major websites went down after cloud platform Amazon Web Services experienced major outages early Monday. TheÂ  outage affected several Amazon (AMZN) services, including Alexa, while also reportedly creating disruptions for Disney+, Lyft, the New York Times, Reddit, Ring, Snapchat, Reddit, Ring, Robinhood, T-Mobile, United Airlines, Venmo, Verizon, gaming site Fortnite, OpenAIâs ChatGPT, Epic Games Store, AI model Perplexity and the McDonalds app. Shares of Amazon were little-changed in premarket trading. The shares have lost 3% since the start of the year, making Amazon the only member of the Magnificent 7 group of major technology stocks to be in negative territory in 2025.

 Appleâs (AAPL)Â  iPhone 17 model outsold the iPhone 16 by 14% during the first ten days of sales in the U.S. and China, the two markets that make up the bulk of the companyâs phone sales, according to Counterpoint Research. The report said that improvements to the iPhone 17 provided value that helped draw in more buyers. âA better chip, improved display, higher base storage, selfie camera upgrade â all for the same price as last yearâs iPhone 16,â said senior analyst Mengmeng Zhang. The report found that the base model iPhone 17 performed well in China, while the premium iPhone 17 Max saw strong demand in the U.S., with discounts provided by phone carriers helping to spur sales. Apple shares were up 1.5% in recent premarket trading.

 Proxy voting service Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) is advising Tesla (TSLA) shareholders to vote against a proposed $1 trillion pay package for CEO Elon Musk. The proxy firm wrote that it was concerned about the magnitude and structure of the pay package, which features several lofty benchmarks that include pushing the companyâs value to more than $8.5 trillion, well above its current market capitalization of roughly $1.5 trillion. ISS also advised shareholders to reject a proposal for Tesla to invest in Muskâs xAI, the AI company that merged with Muskâs X social media platform earlier this month. Tesla shares, which have gained 33% over the past three months, were up about 1% ahead of the opening bell. The company is scheduled to report earnings on Wednesday.

 Shares of Cooper Companies (COO) surged more than 5% in premarket trading afterÂ activist investor Jana Partners reportedly built a stake in the medical device maker. The Wall Street Journal said Jana is looking for strategic alternatives for the company, including a potential deal to combine the companyâs contact lens unit with rival Bausch + Lomb (BLCO). Shares of Bausch + Lomb were down nearly 2% in premarket trading.

93,2025-10-20,"Today we're tracking a pair of solid discounts on the AirPods Pro 2 and AirTag 4-Pack on Amazon, including an all-time low price on the Bluetooth trackers.

Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.
Amazon this week has Apple's AirTag 4-Pack for $64.99, down from $99.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on the accessory.


$34 OFF
AirTag 4-Pack for $64.99

Amazon also has the AirTag 1-Pack for $24.99, down from $29.00. We've seen a steeper $19.00 price tag on the 1-Pack recently, so if you're in the market for the AirTag, it's likely best to go for the 4-Pack for the best value.

Secondly, Amazon has Apple's AirPods Pro 2 for $169.99, down from $249.00. Delivery on this one is delayed slightly to the end of October and early November.


$79 OFF
AirPods Pro 2 for $169.99

This is a solid second-best price on the AirPods Pro 2, coming in about $19 higher compared to the previous record low price, which we haven't seen in a couple of months. 
Apple just released the AirPods Pro 3 last month, but we haven't seen particularly steep discounts on the new model yet, so anyone in the market for a Pro model should still find good value in Amazon's discount on the AirPods Pro 2.

Getting a reservation at Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes' new restaurant, 1587 Prime, is no easy feat.
Some have even compared scoring a table at the new Kansas City steakhouse to snagging coveted tickets to Taylor Swift's sold-out Eras Tour.
Reservations dropped in August and, within minutes, tables seemed to be fully booked through late October. The restaurant wasn't even set to open its doors until late September.
During that first drop, my group was lucky enough to secure a reservation for Saturday, October 18, when I'd be in town for a Chiefs game.
Mahomes and Kelce cofounded the steakhouse in partnership with Noble 33, a hospitality company that specializes in fine-dining concepts.
It was immediately on my radar because I'm a longtime fan of the Chiefs, and Kelce's been my favorite player for a decade. He also recently got engaged to Swift, an artist I love and have been following since her debut.
On top of that, my husband and I enjoy trying different upscale steakhouses.
Located inside the Loews Hotel in downtown Kansas City, 1587 Prime officially opened to the public on September 17.
My first impression of the restaurant can be summarized in one word: luxurious.
With its marble doorway and gold accents, the restaurant gave me quite the first impression before I'd even walked through the large double doors.
The steakhouse has several dining guidelines in place, such as a request for ""business casual or dressy evening wear"" and no children under the age of 16 after 7 p.m., so my expectations for a top-notch experience were high.
As I entered, I was met with large cuts of meat displayed in glass-front cases, an illuminated marble staircase, and walls lined with bottles of wine.
Apparently, 1587 Prime has live musical performances every night.
The band playing during our Saturday night dinner was fabulous. We appreciated that they performed at a volume that entertained us but never made us feel like our meal was being interrupted.
The band would play a few songs, then take a short break, switching between live music and a well-curated playlist. The jazz and R&B selections were a hit â our party even stopped conversation to comment on the music on several occasions.
As the decor seemed to hint at, 1587 Prime offered an impressive selection of beverages.
Most of the cocktails â around $18 to $25 a pop â were a nod to the Chiefs or Kansas City itself.
The Players section of the cocktail menu featured four drinks for the cofounders and their leading ladies: Showtime, a nod to Mahomes' nickname; Big Yeti, one of Kelce's nicknames; Queen B, a tribute to Mahomes' wife, Brittany; and The Alchemy, titled after a song on Swift's album ""The Tortured Poet's Department.""
Diners could also order a custom-crafted drink from the martini cart, as well as mocktails, beers, or a glass from an extensive list of over 100 different wines.
The Swiftie in me couldn't pass up The Alchemy, and I'm glad I didn't, since it was more than just a drink â it was an experience.
Upon delivery, the base of the vodka drink was set on fire, and we watched in awe as it sparkled. The cocktail itself was smooth, fruity, and light.
We also ordered the Big Yeti, a play on an old-fashioned. It was brought to our table in a smoked decanter with a glass containing an ice cube imprinted with ""1587.""
The server poured the smoky brown liquid over ice and then coated the rim of the glass with an orange peel. It tasted sweeter than a typical old-fashioned, but still delicious.
We were served complimentary bread to start, but I wanted to save room for all of the food we'd be ordering, so I didn't try it. The half of my party who did said it was good, though.
The menu featured steaks as we expected, plus several other seafood and land options. The menu felt pretty approachable, and prices felt comparable to those of many upscale steakhouses.
Soups, salads, and appetizers generally cost between $16 and $40, and some seafood dishes were listed for market price.
We started with Togarashi fried chicken ($25) and jumbo lump crab cakes ($36).
The pan-seared crab cakes felt like a great value, even though there were only three. The tartar sauce and blistered-tomato relish paired nicely with the cakes, which seemed like they were 85% crabmeat.
The chicken came with five chicken strips and a trio of honey sauces â truffle, hot, and wasabi. All of them were delicious.
For the entrÃ©e, I got twin lobster tails ($76), and my husband ordered the 6-ounce Japanese A5 wagyu strip ($125) and added the tableside flambÃ© experience for $27.
When our entrÃ©es came, staff rolled a cart over to our table and flambÃ©ed a mixture of brandy, bone-marrow butter, and herbs before drizzling it over the steak.
Again, the experience? Unmatched.
The rest of our party was also split between surf and turf, choosing the diver scallops ($48) and another 6-ounce order of the highest grade of wagyu â this one with bleu-cheese butter for an extra $7.
Each entrÃ©e was incredible. The steak and scallops melted in our mouths like butter, and the lobster had a unique smoky char to it.
The sides are shareable, so we split truffle fries ($16), honey-glazed grilled carrots ($16), and the twice-baked potato ($24).
All in all, we didn't have a single bad dish.
The Victory Formation menu features a list of desserts, from carrot cake to apple pie, and alcoholic pairings to go with them.
For dessert, we ordered two cast-iron chocolate-chip cookies with vanilla ice cream for $16 each.
Each cookie was served warm in miniature skillets and was gooey and rich. The ice cream added a cool creaminess, making it a well-rounded dessert and the perfect finish to a great meal.
I could tell how much thought went into so many parts of the restaurant, from its mirror with perfect lighting for selfies to its menu's fun details for locals and fans of Mahomes, Kelce, and the Chiefs.
For example, Mahomes' signature drink contains Coors Light syrup (he's endorsed the beer for years) and diners can add a Mahomes ketchup flight to their steak (he famously puts ketchup on his steak).
1587 Prime also serves Garage Beer, an Ohio-based brewing company that Travis and his brother Jason, announced part ownership of last year.
Plus, I appreciated that the menu features local businesses, like desserts from McLain's Bakery and drinks from Boulevard Brewing Co., one of my favorite spots in Kansas City.
The restaurant describes itself as a ""contemporary steakhouse with Kansas City spirit."" It really did feel like a high-end slice of the city between its local offerings and lively, elegant vibe.
That said, it's not cheap. Our group of four spent just under $800 before tip on six cocktails, two appetizers, four entrÃ©es, three sides, and two desserts, plus a few add-ons (like the flambÃ© experience and bleu-cheese butter).
We were also able to save $50 on our meal using an offer I'd found online. When all was said and done, my husband and I spent about $427 on our half of the bill.
Here's the thing: We went into this meal knowing it would be a special experience and splurge. And I have to say, 1587 Prime did not disappoint.
Would I order this much on a normal night out? No. Would I go here on an average weekday? Also, no â but, let's be honest, if I could afford to â¦ yes.
However, I'm so happy we went, and I'd absolutely recommend this spot to others looking for a meal that combines delicious food with a memorable experience. If I have the chance to go back, I will.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang spoke at the Citadel Securities Future of Global Markets 2025 conference last week, and would you believe it, most of the conversation centred around AI. However, the NV head honcho also had some comments to make on China's role within AI development, and Nvidia's efforts to sell its AI hardware within the countryâalong with some commentary on US trade policy between the two.
""It's important to be mindful that what harms China could oftentimes also harm America, and even worse,"" said Huang (via Wccftech). ""And so before we leap towards policies that are hurtful to other people, take a step back and maybe reflect on what are the policies that are helpful to America.""
""China has about 50% of the world's AI researchers, incredible schools, incredible focus in AI, lots of passion around AI. And I think it's a mistake to not have those researchers build AI on American technology,"" he continued.
""We are 100% out of Chinaâ¦ we went from 95% market share to 0%, and so I can't imagine any policy maker thinking that's a good idea, that whatever policy we implemented caused America to lose one of the largest markets in the world.""
Certainly, Nvidia looks to have found itself at the centre of trade frictions between the two countries. While pre-existing US AI chip export bans to China appeared to be loosening earlier this year, in the form of Nvidia's US government-approved licenses to sell its H20 AI GPUs in the country, progress has since appeared to stall, as the two countries engage in a protracted trade dispute.
 



Nvidia's CFO recently described the stalled progress as ""a little geopolitical situation between the two governments"", but little or not, it still appears that Nvidia remains in AI chip limbo in regards to the Chinese market.
For China's part, production was also reportedly paused on H20 GPUs as a result of security concerns from the Chinese authorities halting their sale, and potential buyers were left waiting to purchase chips that have yet to make it past the restrictions. Huang has also previously expressed his disappointment at the news that China's internet regulator had banned some of the country's largest tech firms from buying the China-specific RTX Pro 6000D.

And all the while Nvidia watches as the two geopolitical giants battle it out, its Chinese competitors, like Huawei, look to be making great progress in its absence.
Last week, Trump announced a new 100% tariff on Chinese goods in relation to a rare earth metal dispute, alongside new export controls on ""any and all critical software"", which suggests that trade friction between the two superpowers isn't likely to calm any time soon. While AI hardware has slipped from the headlines in the recent disputes, it's never far from the frameâand Nvidia's AI chips still remain unobtainable by legitimate means on Chinese shores.
 



In short, the ongoing trade disputes between the US and China have been a real headache for Nvidia, and while Huang and the Trump administration appear to be on good terms, even the considerable weight of the most valuable company in the world doesn't appear to have made much of a dent on current US or Chinese government policy.
It looks like Nvidia will just have to wait to see how things play outâ because as relations between the two countries currently stand, the company's Chinese market aspirations appear to be well outside of its control.

The United Nations Statistical Commission declared today World Statistics Day with the theme of âConnecting the world with data we can trust.â 
Given the almost daily news headlines about identify theft, hacking, phishing, malware, and denial of service, itâs no wonder that trust is in need of a remedial campaign. But doubts about statistics have been around long before the internet came into being. Nineteenth century humorist Mark Twain once famously said, âThere are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.â 
In business, truth and trust are under constant surveillance by attorneys, auditors, analysts, internal monitors, and investigative journalists. Before any responsible company presents their statistics to an audience in the marketplace or the public, the figures have been reviewed in microscopic detail. Most presenters merely recite those figures as a laundry list, but the numbers cannot speak for themselvesâwhich creates an opportunity for you to go beyond the numbers and add value. 
For guidance, we turn to one of the most diligently vetted documents using statistics extant: the âS-1,â or the formal registration form that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires for companies going public. The document is composed of pro forma boilerplate sections such as âRisk Factorsâ and âHistorical Financial Information.â Another is called âManagementâs Discussion and Analysis,â also known by its acronym, MD&A, a series of paragraphs that accompany numeric charts and tables. 
MD&A is a perfect analog for the role of the presenterâs narrative and there are six options you can use to add value to your statistics:
One final overarching point about all of the above: make them part of your spoken narrative and not on the slides. Donât expect your audience to be persuaded by reading your slides. Your role is to add value.
In the words of the famous slogan from the Tom Cruise film, Jerry Maguire: âShow me the money!â"

For education leaders across K-12 and higher education, Artificial Intelligence has rightly commanded massive attention. Day in and day out, the dialogue is urgent: How do we use it to personalize learning? How do we train teachers? How do we stop students from using it to cheat? 
These questions are vital, but they focus inwardâon the mechanics of schooling. In the urgency to manage the classroom effects of AI, education leaders risk overlooking an even more profound development outside their walls: the dramatic reshaping of the labor market. 
If addressed proactively, this shift is not a threat to be mitigated but can be a catalyst for increasing economic opportunity. It offers a chance to align learning with the realities of the modern economy, ensuring students are prepared not for the jobs of today, but for the rapidly evolving roles of tomorrow.
Right now, the signals on AIâs workforce impact are mixed, which can lead to hesitation. Some economists predict massive job displacement; others foresee a new golden age of productivity. But everyone agrees on one thing: change is certain. Education leaders can no longer wait for perfect data. Itâs time to build educational systems that are as dynamic as the technology itself, ensuring students capture the enormous potential for long-term economic mobility.
To design the future of learning, we must understand the evolving landscape of work. The labor market is already moving in three critical ways.
Every student, regardless of their eventual careerâfrom plumber to portfolio managerâwill need some AI literacy. This isnât just about knowing how to write a good prompt; it's about understanding how AI integrates into daily workflow, how to verify its output and the ethical responsibilities that come with using it as a co-pilot. This skill must be embedded across educational domains, not just taught in a single technology class.
While AI will impact every community, the creation of AI technology itself is a focused industry. As the Brookings Institution has illustrated, AI talent and innovation are heavily concentrated in just a few âsuperstarâ metro areas like the Bay Area, but major âStar Hubsâ are emerging in places like Austin, Boston and New York. While these hubs are where the technology is built, many other areas are poised to become âAdoption Centersâ as companies integrate AI widely. Local education leaders need to look closely at their regional labor data and partner with industry to create faster, more relevant pathwaysâfrom certificates to advanced degreesâto feed this talent demand locally.
The most optimistic data points toward a net increase in global employment, assuming that workers are upskilled. The World Economic Forumâs 2025 Future of Jobs Report anticipates that AI and automation will contribute to a net creation of 78 million jobs globally by 2030, but also notes that nearly 40% of key workforce skills are expected to change in the next few years. The jobs most resilient to AI are those demanding uniquely human traits: creativity, critical thinking, problem-solving and emotional intelligence. When AI automates tasks, it increases the value of the human workerâs judgment, collaboration and relationship-building skills. Education systems must prioritize cultivating these traits above rote memory.
The immediate future of AI is not a trend to be managed; it is likely a tidal wave that will redraw the economic map. A reactive stance may compromise our studentsâ future. Education leaders must adopt a framework of proactive, continuous adaptation.
Here are three concrete actions leaders should take now to lead in the AI era:
The conversation about AIâs impact on the workforceâand the resulting implications for educationâmust transcend traditional silos. Leaders from multiple sectors need to forge alliances to prioritize this issue. We need strategic tables that unite leaders from education, state workforce agencies and private sector employers. While many state governments have established task forces to study AI policyâwith a Government Technology analysis indicating that 33 states have launched some form of AI working groupâwe need to expand these efforts to focus directly on educationâs response to labor market demand.
A leading example is the California State University Systemâs Workforce Acceleration Board, which actively links university academic offerings to future workforce needs. By creating a formalized, continuous feedback loop between employers and educators, our systems can be more responsive now and into the future.
Education institutions must treat their program portfolio with the strategic agility of a modern corporation. Every programâfrom auto repair to accountingâneeds an annual âAI Vulnerabilityâ assessment. This involves leveraging real-time labor market data to determine:
Leading systems are already moving this way. In New York City Public Schools (NYCPS), where an ambitious effort to reimagine high school pathways is well underway, district leadership recognized the need to analyze the demand for AI-related skills and evaluate how well current high school pathways are preparing students for those jobs. As a national AI hub, there is significant demand for âAI Creatorâ roles in New York City. But the results of Education Strategy Groupâs labor market analysis for the school system also showed that demand for AI skills extends beyond the technology sector. Employers in commercial banking, marketing and business are increasingly seeking workers who can understand and apply AI in their fields, meaning widespread implications for how NYCPS structures its student pathway offerings. 
The findings of âAI Vulnerabilityâ assessments need to inform swift action and adaptationâwhich has not always been the strong suit of our education systems. The pace of labor market impact means that neither students nor employers can afford to wait for education and training opportunities to catch up. Schools and colleges need to be ready and willing to adjust their programs to align with their evolving understanding of how AI will impact particular career fields. 
A few leading communities offer compelling examples of what this adaptation can look like at both the K-12 and postsecondary levels. 
In response to its labor market analysis, NYCPS is considering how to strengthen its FutureReady pathways to embed AI knowledge and skills across disciplines, ensuring students graduate not just as AI consumers but as informed, capable contributors in an increasingly AI-powered economy. 
In Tennessee, Nashville State Community College mapped regional demand for AI skills and has aligned postsecondary credential pathways to prepare students for those emerging roles. Nashville State is now exploring how to embed AI literacy skills into a variety of âAI Userâ pathways, such as business management, sales, finance and marketing. It also recently partnered with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to rapidly modernize its programs to align with high-demand AI and cloud computing skills, bridging the local talent gap.
The coming AI revolution is not just about harnessing tools; it is about building skills and expanding opportunity. By moving from cautiously managing risk to confidently leading through change, education leaders can guarantee that our schools and institutions are setting every student on a path to economic opportunity and driving the next great era of American economic potential."
