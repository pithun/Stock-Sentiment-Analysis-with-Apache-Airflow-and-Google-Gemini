Nvidia just became the first company in the world to be worth $5 trillion, just four months after it made history by hitting a $4 trillion market capitalization.
The company owed that last bump to a series of high-profile announcements that CEO Jensen Huang made at the first Washington D.C. edition of its conference, GTC, and the raging hype cycle around companies working in AI.
On Tuesday, Huang announced that Nvidia would partner with:
The company also delighted investors when Huang announced that Nvidia is expecting half a trillion dollars in orders for its Blackwell and Rubin chips through next year.
Also helping Nvidia’s case is its close ties to the Trump administration, which was on full display at the GTC in D.C. Huang spent a good chunk of his time praising the administration and the President personally, saying that “no one works harder” than him. Huang also told the crowd that he is jetting off to South Korea to meet the President on his Asia diplomacy tour. Trump is supposed to have a key trade meeting with China’s Xi Jinping in South Korea, and the outcome of that meeting is likely to be of great concern to Nvidia.
Perhaps the only thing that has been weighing on Nvidia in the market the past few months has been the trade dispute between the U.S. and China. Nvidia has been caught in the crossfire of that dispute many times. The tech giant is banking on a trade deal that would allow it to resume selling its chips in China, in what was once one of its strongest markets. Gaining Trump’s confidence is key to doing that.
The market value of the biggest names in AI is off the charts, and Nvidia leads the charge. There are only three companies in the world that are worth more than $4 trillion, and they are all tech giants buoyed by the AI trade. Microsoft was the second company to cross the benchmark after Nvidia in July, and Apple became the third yesterday.
This meteoric rise in value only makes fears of an AI bubble worse. Not only are most experts raising concerns that AI companies are overvalued, but their outsized influence on the market and the U.S. economy makes any downturn correction dangerous. The Bank of England warned earlier this month that “equity market valuations appear stretched” for AI companies, stock market price valuations were comparable to the peak of the dot-com bubble, and that the market share of the top five members of the S&P 500 (Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Meta) was at its highest concentration in 50 years.
The U.S. market is banking on an unprecedented boom in AI demand, and Nvidia is considered the darling of the AI trade. They are in charge of supplying the chips that are at the core of this infrastructure build-out. But if demand does not shape up as expected or if the build-out runs into any material bottlenecks, like supply chain problems or a lack of energy and resources, then all this valuation (and everything attached to it) is at risk of coming crashing down.

Donald Trump appears to be getting back into the casino business, in a manner of speaking.Â This time it wonât be Atlantic City slot machines and roulette tables: On Tuesday, the presidentâs media firm, Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., announced it was partnering with the digital asset exchange Crypto.com to make prediction markets available via Truth Social. The new product, called âTruth Predict,â will enable Truth Social users to bet on a wide range of future events like election outcomes, sports, and commodity prices. These wagers will take the form of prediction contracts, which are typically priced in cents and reflect the percentage of confidence bettors have in a potential outcome. If you bet correctly, the contract settles for $1, but if youâre wrong, it goes to zero. TMTGâs new offering will compete with existing prediction markets like the US-regulated Kalshi and Polymarket, which is headquartered in New York but hasnât offered services to US customers since reaching a settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in 2022.Truth Predict plans to launch in the US first and then expand internationally âonce all the requisite requirements are met.â The product will begin beta testing soon, according to Tuesdayâs announcement. President Trump was the largest shareholder in TMTG, but after winning the general election last year, he transferred 114,750,000 shares worth around $4 billion to a trust controlled by his son Donald Trump Jr. A Securities and Exchange Commission filing suggests President Trump maintains indirect control of the shares. Digital prediction markets present a few thorny philosophical questions. Proponents say there is value to decentralized prognostication, arguing that the betting markets give people a window into what the masses actually think will happen, free from the influence of powerful corporations and political interests. âThe point of Polymarket is that from the perspective of traders, itâs a betting site, but from the perspective of viewers itâs a news site,â Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin said on X last year. âThere are all kinds of people (including elites) on Twitter and the internet making harmful and inaccurate predictions about conflicts, and being able to go and see if people with actual skin in the game think that something has a 2% chance or a 50% chance is a valuable feature that can help keep people sane.âBut sites like Polymarket have also been criticized for offering war markets where users can bet on ongoing and potential geopolitical conflicts. âWill China invade Taiwan in 2025?â currently sits at a 3% chance on Polymarket, while âWill the U.S. invade Venezuela in 2025?â is at 14%.The present level of liquidity betting on these events isnât likely to influence their outcomes, but critics argue that if enough money flows into any one market in the future, it could incentivize powerful interests to tip the scales and make something â an assassination, a coup, a war â happen in real life. âItâs an extreme example, but any prediction market about an influenceable event will start to either incentivize action or subsidize the inevitable if sufficiently liquid enough, even if that wasnât the original intention,â said Zach Rynes, a community liaison for the decentralized oracle network Chainlink, on X last year. âIf these markets traded with $100 million+ liquidity, would that change the outcome? Maybe not, but if insider traded, would they not be subsidizing war? I donât think prediction markets are passive observers; their existence influences outcomes when operating at scale.âCFTC regulations prohibit event contracts that reference terrorism, assassination, war or any other illegal activity, so US-approved firms donât offer direct invasion markets like Polymarketâs. But that doesnât mean those marketplaces are free from potentially controversial incentives: On Kalshi, gamblers can wager on the number of deportations in Trumpâs first year of office, or whether leaders like Venezuelan President NicolÃ¡s Maduro will remain in power through 2025 (though Kalshi, in an effort to disincentivize assassination, does note that in the case of Maduroâs death, the market would pay out the last traded price rather than settling to $1 or zero). Those controversial incentives could appear even more tangled on a prediction markets platform so closely affiliated with the president of the United States.

          Trump posts just 5% of the tweets under his name, according to a new report.
        

          AI chatbots are terrible fact-checkers.
        

          Here comes the next Nuclear Age.
        

          ""This is about as fascist as you get, right?""
        

          It's getting harder to tell which unhinged Trump tweets are real.
        

          Trump ran as the bitcoin president, but stablecoins and crypto grifting have taken priority.

""had secured half a trillion dollars in orders for its AI chips "" by direct investment in customers. surely that has never been a bad thing...
Those that bought NVDA early, and


Those that wish they did.


That is all. Do you want to buy now?   It is hard to imagine that the market cap would go to $10T but then again, $5T was pure science fiction not that long ago.
Agreed.  I didn't buy in nearly early enough, but my money is growing so that's all that matters.  Even if the stock drops precipitously, I'm up far enough I'll still make out.
The next two years should be interesting to see where things go from here.
The thing is, its all based on nonsense and hot air. Nvidia doesnt have the sales to justify the price. Eventually the market is going to correct, and on that day the market will shudder as if the very firmament was shuddering beneath the heavens.
The next stock market crash is gonna be a doozy. The smart money is on shorting NVDA and Tesla (Another company whos market cap is abusrd in comparison to actual sales)
The next bailout  is gonna be a doozy.Fixed that for you
The next bailout  is gonna be a doozy.
Fixed that for you
The cumulative losses since 2010 for those who were trying to make a killing shorting TSLA is estimated at over $65B.


But you wanna give it a try go ahead.  I won't stop you.
Market cap is one of those things that only matters to Wall Street.   You can have a company that is losing money year after year after year, has a ""value of assets"" that is at $1 Billion, but then has a ""market cap"" of $1 Trillion.   Market cap being number of shares multiplied by stock price makes the market cap about hype.
the AI bubble popping is going be terrible for a lot of corporations & investors
The AI bubble is probably slower to pop than the dot-com bubble because it's mostly large multi-product companies that are receiving the most investor money, and it's hard for outsiders to tell what's really happening inside. Via bundling, freebies, and multiple accounting shell games these companies can doctor their AI revenue to keep investors duped.
And if they lay off staff due to lower general revenue, they can claim it's just AI replacement. Without embedded insiders familiar with inner workings of a co., it's hard to check.
Whenever somebody looks into details, they rarely see good signs. [axios.com]
With dot-com bubble, most the relevant companies were single product/service  startups, so it was easier to see if they can support themselves. They couldn't hide bad products behind good products.
After the AI poppage I suspect there will be big investor/shareholder lawsuits over the hiding.
Shed no tears for these corps and investors for the lowly taxpayer shall carry them through their dark times.
Whose taxes were used to buy trillions in public and private assets in 2008 and 2020? When the Fed can raise base money 40% and inflation only barely touched 9%, is printing money a net gain?
Why wouldn't the Fed step in to buy private equities and save too big to fail companies, as usual?
i doubt they can afford to this time around. despite the promises of elimination ""waste, fraud & abuse"" the deficit is as bad as ever and the debt looks to crack $40 Trillion by end of Spring 2026

The invention of a far more efficient algorithm may mean that the assumption is falseEven in the case of a far more efficient algorithm, the gigantic data centers may likely be a way to create a differentiated version of AI with superior capabilities
The counterpoint would be that we may reach a threshold beyond which 'superior' has less meaning

NVIDIA is such a bubble, while it does have products, AI is a bubble that needs to pop at some point when Wall Street finally figures out that AI in consumer products doesn't have NVIDIA as a significant player.   NVIDIA doesn't have a CPU, so desktop and laptop computers may have NVIDIA products in them, but there are very few programs that use AI on the local device.

Not normally a conspiracy theorist.

Now AI is a thing, even more so requiring GPUs to do not so much GPU things. Is there a secret world order which needs this massive pattern recognition global infrastructure for some ......

3,2025-10-29,"Nvidia today became the first public company to reach a $5 trillion market capitalization, hitting the milestone 3.5 months after surpassing $4 trillion.
Over the past week, Nvidia's shares have climbed 14.5 percent due to demand for its GPUs and the possibility that it might be able to sell its most advanced chips in China. As of now, the U.S. prevents Nvidia from selling its Blackwell AI chips to China, and China has also restricted Chinese companies from importing some Nvidia chips because of national security concerns. Trump said that he would discuss Nvidia's ""super duper chip"" with Chinese president Xi Jinping on October 30, leading to hopes that the situation might change.
Nvidia's AI chips are key for developing and training large language AI models, and almost every major tech company is working on some kind of AI product. Apple, for example, is building out AI infrastructure to power Apple Intelligence and other future AI capabilities. Apple is using Apple Silicon chips, but it has also reportedly invested in Nvidia server technology.
Nvidia's growth has outpaced Apple, Microsoft, and other tech companies, but Apple reached a milestone of its own yesterday. Just ahead of Thursday's earnings call, Apple briefly reached a $4 trillion valuation. Apple's stock price has dropped slightly since then, but the company is close to hitting that target again.
Apple is pumping out its own artificial intelligence servers, and the first units started shipping out this month. It is unlikely that Apple will compete with Nvidia in the server market because its servers are designed for internal use.

Ukraine is moving closer to exporting its battle-tested weaponry for the first time.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Tuesday that the country's program for the controlled exports of domestically manufactured weaponry should start in November.
Ukraine effectively froze the ability of any company making weaponry to export its tech after Russia's full-scale invasion began, making the country's own defense the priority. However, Ukraine's defense industry has undergone massive growth. The export restrictions are now hamstringing industries.
In a shift, Ukraine has been making plans for how it could export to partner nations, which would allow companies to scale up production beyond the limitations of Ukraine's defense budget. Key to this project, Ukrainian leadership has said, will be ensuring Ukraine's defense is unaffected, that Russia doesn't acquire Ukrainian tech, and that exports go only to countries that have supported it against Russia.
On Tuesday, Zelenskyy did not elaborate on what kind of weapons Ukraine would export, but he has previously pointed to some kinds of drones as an area where Ukraine has a surplus ready to export.
They were also identified this month by Brave1, a Ukrainian government-backed body aimed at accelerating military technology, as systems that were ready to be sold abroad. It identified ground drones, drone software, and naval drones as products made by Ukraine that are export options.
Motivated by wartime necessity, Ukraine's defense industry has boomed, with companies making drones, artillery, missiles, and other equipment. Zelenskyy said that more than 40% of the weapons used on the front line are Ukrainian-made. He said that needs to be 50% by the end of the year.
Many in Ukraine's defense industry have long pushed for the ability to export, arguing that it would solve a problem that Ukrainian officials have acknowledged as well: The country's defense companies are able to make far more weaponry than Ukraine's defense ministry can buy.
Serhiy Goncharov, the CEO of the National Association of Ukrainian Defense Industries (NAUDI), said that the export revenue would allow producers to increase production, improve efficiency, and also lower costs, putting them in a better position to support Ukraine. Increased revenue could also be allocated to research and testing for new innovations, he said.
He told Business Insider previously ""the export of some part of military production wouldn't harm the defense of Ukraine."" Instead, ""it would increase the potential of the defense of Ukraine.""
Some Ukrainian companies have said they are ready to start selling abroad as soon as they are allowed and have promoted their equipment in other countries in preparation, saying they have seen notable demand.
Drones have been used more in this war than in any other conflict in history. They are used to survey the battlefield, collect key intelligence, and launch attacks on soldiers and weaponry, including some systems worth millions.
The war has made Ukraine a leader in drone technology, with hundreds of companies making them, ranging from small outfits in garages to massive operations. Most of the drones it uses are made domestically. It said more than 96% of the 1.5 million drones it bought last year were of Ukrainian origin.
Ukraine has made major advancements in ground robots and naval drone technology, systems that have risen to greater prominence in the war in Ukraine. The country's ground robots execute one-way attacks, fire heavy weapons, lay mines, and evacuate injured troops. And the naval drones have menaced Black Sea Fleet ships and engaged Russian aircraft with surface-to-air missiles. Many of these naval drone innovations are new to combat.
Zelenskyy said last month that funds from selling naval drones and other weaponry could be funneled into buying additional aerial drones for Ukraine as demand continues to soar. That would seem to indicate that aerial drones might not be suitable for export, but the Ukrainian president has suggested that these systems could be possible exports. Whether these hit the global market remains to be seen.
Partner nations are paying close attention to the war, concerned about further Russian aggression, and seeking to learn what works in modern war. Part of the response has been the development of drones and counter-drone tech.
It's not yet clear which countries would buy Ukrainian weaponry like drones if they were made available, but Western nations have praised Ukrainian innovations. Zelenskyy said last month Ukraine had offers from partners nations but did not provide any details, including which countries were involved.
Ukraine's partners may not need to rely on drones as much as it has, given their larger and better-stocked militaries, but they are still investing in the tech.
NATO member Denmark is one partner nation that has praised Ukraine's defense innovation, and it says it wants access to Ukrainian tech amid rising concern about Russia. Western companies are also moving into Ukraine and partnering with its defense industry, which not only helps Ukraine produce but also helps Western companies learn from Ukraine's experience.

Apple is about to face its next big test.
After launching its new product cycle and smashing through a $4 trillion valuation this month, the iPhone maker is on deck to report its earnings for the fourth quarter after the closing bell on Thursday.
Wall Street is gearing up for another strong quarter of results. Analysts expect the firm to have pulled in $102 billion in revenue for the latest reporting period. Earnings per share are expected to be around $0.95.
It's been an exciting year for Apple, which has jockeyed alongside other mega-cap tech firms to be at the center of the AI boom, though some analysts have worried that it could be falling behind other mega-cap peers that are pouring money into the technology.
Demand for the latest slate of iPhones is expected to be a key focus for investors heading into the fourth-quarter results. Other issues, like demand for its products in China and the potential impact of tariffs, will also be on shareholders' radar.
Here's what analysts on Wall Street have to say about the stock:
Bank of America has a strong outlook for Apple over the next five years. Analysts pointed to revenues potentially increasing due to artificial intelligence and the possible impact of AI on its coming product offerings.
Analysts also said they saw ""strength"" in new iPhone demand, and estimated that total iPhone unit sales could reach 57 million for the current quarter, compared to consensus estimates of 54 million.
""Reiterate Buy on strong capital returns, eventual winner in AI at the edge & optionality from new products/markets,"" BofA said on their rating of the stock.
Analysts also lifted their price target on the stock from $270 to $320 a share, implying 19% upside.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs said they expected Apple to beat on earnings for the quarter, driven largely by strong demand for its new slate of iPhones.
The bank estimated that iPhone product revenue could see a 10% year-over-year increase to $50.8 billion, compared to the consensus estimate of $49.8 billion in revenue for the quarter.
Apple could also see its services revenue grow 13% year-over-year for the quarter, thanks to continued momentum across subscription services like iCloud+ and AppleCare+, analysts added.
Still, ""key areas of debate"" among investors could include where iPhone demand is sustainable due to trade policy uncertainty, as well as risks to the company's App Store revenue, the bank said.
Goldman reiterated its ""Buy"" rating for the stock and issued a price target of $279 a share, implying 3% upside from current levels.
JPMorgan said it expected Apple earnings to ""track modestly better"" from September through the end of the year, thanks to strong demand for the iPhone 17.
The bank also said it expected Apple to post solid revenue growth in the first quarter of its 2026 fiscal year.
""AAPL shares are heading into the upcoming earnings print with a greater halo of positivity than any time in the past year,"" analysts wrote in a recent client note, adding that they believed that chatter around Apple's investment thesis had narrowed down to the strength of new iPhone sales.
Apple stock could be boosted by a few catalysts when it reports earnings for the fourth quarter, Melius Research said.
The research firm said it believed that the company's sales in China would pick up over the near term. Profit margins could also improve on demand for Apple's new lineup of iPhones, it added.
The firm could also report a lower hit than expected from tariffs, analysts wrote in a note to clients this month, adding that they believed Apple was ""getting its groove back.""
""We think there is more to go as a beat and raise could be on the horizon when it reports,"" analysts wrote of the stock's momentum.""Bottom Line: Apple is on a mission to silence its critics. We see upside to sales in China into CY26 and momentum in new models overall.""
The firm reiterated its ""Buy"" rating on the stock and issued a price target of $290 a share, implying 7% upside from current levels.
Apple looks like it's in the best position heading into its upcoming earnings report than it has been in a year, according to Angelo Zino, a senior equity analyst at CFRA Research.
In a recent note, Zino pointed to how investors now have more clarity relating to Apple's regulatory issues and the potential impact of tariffs.
""Recent comments about tariffs tied to the company from the Trump administration make us feel much more comfortable about the margin outlook ahead, he added.
Demand for iPhones also looks solid heading into the print. CFRA said it was ""conservatively"" estimating that iPhone revenue was on track to grow 6% for the current quarter and 5% for the upcoming quarter.
CFRA issued a ""Buy"" rating on Apple and a $280 price target, implying 4% upside from the stock's current levels.

The U.S. Federal Reserve announced a 25-basis-point rate cut on Wednesday, but crypto prices still slumped.
A lower federal funds rate makes borrowing costs more affordable, stimulating financial activity. Rate cut announcements typically boost the prices of riskier assets.
Neither crypto nor equities followed that script on Wednesday, however. A potential reason? In a speech following the announcement, Fed Chair Jerome Powell struck a more inflation-hawkish tone than expected when discussing the possibility of future cuts.
âIn the committee’s discussions at this meeting, there were strongly differing views about how to proceed in December,â Powell explained. âA further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting is not a foregone conclusion. Far from it. Policy is not on a preset course.â
His comments undercut the expectations of traders: On Tuesday, the CME Groupâs FedWatch tool, which tracks 30-Day Fed Funds futures prices, estimated there was a 90.5% chance the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) would slash the policy rate by another 25 basis points at its next meeting in December. That probability plunged to around 65% after Powellâs speech.
The overall crypto market cap dipped by 0.8% on Wednesday, with Bitcoin dropping by 1.3%, per data from CoinGecko. The S&P 500 tracked sideways.
In his speech, Powell said downside risks to employment had increased, justifying the FOMCâs step towards a more neutral policy stance this week. The Fed chair also noted that longer-term inflation expectations remain consistent with the Fedâs 2% goal, though he acknowledged that the Trump Administrationâs tariffs could impact that trajectory.
âHigher tariffs are pushing up prices in some categories of goods, resulting in higher overall inflation,â Powell said. âA reasonable base case is that the effects on inflation will be relatively short-lived â a one-time shift in the price level. But it is also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent, and that is a risk to be assessed and managed. Our obligation is to ensure that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem.â

Getting laid off can be scary. Knowing what to do when it happens can take away some of the fear — especially as big-name companies cut workers.
In the immediate aftermath of getting let go, you'll likely be in shock. So, it's important not to sign any documents your former employer hands you right away and take time to process what has happened.
When you're ready to begin your search, it's best to approach the hunt like, well, a job.
""I wouldn't dillydally in a market like this because it can take a long time,"" Jennifer Schielke, the CEO of the staffing firm Summit Group Solutions, told Business Insider. ""Get into the rhythm that you're used to in the workplace.""
Here are three steps you'll want to consider taking post-layoff:
Your instinct might be to immediately start searching for a new role. That's totally understandable. Yet it's wise to take a little time to process what you've gone through and think about your goals, former recruiter Mike Peditto told Business Insider.
""In stressful situations, your panicked reaction is almost never as good as the decision you make after reflection, processing, and intention-setting,"" he said. Everyone's timeout might look different.
""Some people take a month off to travel, and that's great, but most people don't have that cushion. Take whatever you can,"" he said.
The important thing is to take stock. And, because the search can be lonely, you might consider joining a support group for laid-off workers.
You can also think about how you might invest in yourself. Maybe that means boosting your skills in AI. Even though a sluggish labor market can make it hard to be choosy, it's worth reflecting on what you really want from your next role.
Taking a few key practical steps can make you feel like you're regaining some control during an uncertain time.
First, make sure you've gathered all the severance paperwork your employer gave you. Ask any questions you have. Take your time reviewing it and remember that severance is sometimes negotiable.
Apply for unemployment benefits right away, because those can take a while to process. You may also need to determine how to handle any stock options, think about what to do with your 401(k), and see how long your health insurance or COBRA coverage will last.
Now is also a good time to review your spending and, if you haven't, make a budget. There are numerous financial survival tips after a layoff, including canceling any unnecessary subscriptions and seeing if you can get price breaks on your phone or internet bills.
You might get that ick feeling thinking of yourself as a brand, but, like it or not, the reputation you've built through your work history and other interactions matters. Now is a good time to revamp your LinkedIn profile, add an ""open to work"" banner to attract recruiters, and let your connections know about your new status with a layoff message.
If you've kept your résumé up-to-date, great. In any case, you'll probably want to tweak it now. Focus on your skills, accomplishments, and impact, rather than just job titles.
Once you've done that, you can start reaching out to your network. Maybe set up some coffees or quick chats with connections, because that's often far more effective than panic-applying to everything you see.
You can also think about how, in future interviews, you will talk about your layoff. You might even use it as a chance to take bold steps — like negotiating for higher pay or better benefits in your next role.
Have you been through a layoff recently? What made the difference when embarking on a job hunt? Business Insider would like to hear about your experience. Contact this reporter at tparadis@businessinsider.com.

US chipmaker Nvidia on Wednesday became the first company in the world worth $5 trillion in market capitalization.
Shares in the Silicon Valley-based firm rose by 4.5% in early trading to reach $210, riding a wave of confidence in artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia crossed the $4 trillion threshold in early July.
Nvidia's chip systems are used worldwide to train AI applications, powering data centres run by tech giants such as Google and Meta, as well as start-ups like OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT. 
The company's dominance in this fast-growing market has fuelled explosive revenue growth over the past two years, and investors are betting it can defend its lead over competitors.
Ties to Washington
Nvidia's rise has also been bolstered by chief executive Jensen Huang's growing influence in Washington, where he has cultivated a strong relationship with US President Donald Trump.
However, Washington continues to ban the export of Nvidia's most powerful systems to China. US media has reported that Huang warned the White House that that restricting the company's presence in China could ultimately encourage the rise of a powerful local rival.
With its new record, Nvidia has solidified its position as the worldâs most valuable company, far ahead of other tech heavyweights â Microsoft and Apple â which are each valued at around $4 trillion.

13,2025-10-29,"What happens when liberal cities try to circumvent the market
Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.
In big liberal cities, the most politically acceptable form of new housing—apartments officially designated as affordable—isn’t sold to the highest bidder or rented to the first tenant willing to pay the going rate. It’s given out by lottery. This fact deserves a lot more scrutiny than it gets.
Instead of simply allowing enough apartment construction to keep up with employment and population growth, New York, Boston, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and many other cities have restricted housing development but simultaneously offered developers tax credits, zoning changes, and other incentives to include below-market-rate units in their projects, which have in many cases been made available to the public via lottery.
Last year, New York City’s Department of Housing Preservation & Development oversaw drawings for 10,000 such affordable apartments, whose rents are capped so that tenants spend no more than 30 percent of their income on housing. For these units, the city received 6 million applications. In other words, households had a one-in-600 chance of winning each lottery they entered. Boston similarly receives hundreds of applications for many of its available affordable rentals.
Although an open market for housing reflects the economic inequalities that exist within the country’s most prosperous cities, efforts to circumvent it produce what we might call “hidden markets”: mechanisms, such as lotteries and waiting lists, that allocate the necessities of life without meeting demand. Hidden markets—the subject of my research and my new book—can be cruel in their own way. Affordable-housing lotteries reward the ability to navigate complicated city bureaucracies, the strategic sophistication necessary to game systems, and the patience to wait for years, if necessary, to win a unit. As with many other lotteries, most people who play are going to lose.
Yoni Appelbaum: How progressives froze the American dream
The problem is that demand for below-market-rate housing will always outstrip supply. Whenever a resource is available at a below-market price, more people will want it than can get it. Once that happens, communities need a way to decide among the applicants. Many communities try to manage excess demand for low-cost housing via dispiriting waiting lists. In Chicago, waiting lists for public housing can stretch 25 years. In New York, the waiting list for Section 8 vouchers, which provide rental support, was briefly reopened last June for the first time in nearly 15 years.
For cities concerned with equity, lotteries offer a superficially fairer way to decide who gets what. Lotteries can give each person an equal chance of winning or, if a municipality wants, can be designed to provide priorities to designated groups. Many cities provide priority to municipal employees or veterans. San Francisco aims to correct its past mistakes by offering priority to families, and descendants of families, that were displaced in the 1960s through the 1980s by the city’s Redevelopment Agency. Boston gives priority to people displaced by domestic violence or hate crimes.
But lotteries have other significant drawbacks. The most fundamental one is that they do not create more units. Worse, they may contribute to the problem by diverting attention from the true paucity of affordable units.
Annie Lowrey: Why isn’t the government doing more about the housing crisis?
Lotteries might mask how little affordable housing is actually available. Research in behavioral economics has systematically found that people overweight low-probability events. This quirk contributes to our demand for lottery tickets: You can thank it for recent Mega Millions and Powerball jackpots reaching the billions. But it also might give us unjustified hope that lottery entries will eventually lead to stable affordable housing when there truly is not enough to go around. People who might advocate for more development—or move to a city where they can afford market-rate rents—instead enter lottery after lottery hoping for their golden ticket.
For most applicants, housing lotteries provide only an illusion of hope. In 1984, George Orwell imagines a downtrodden proletariat successfully distracted from its oppression by the prospect of winning a lottery with a “weekly pay-out of enormous prizes.” In that classic story, average workers would hold out hope that something better was on the horizon, rather than rising up to improve the status quo.
In the real-world scramble for housing, individuals can take concrete steps to improve their odds of getting an affordable unit. One is to apply to many, many lotteries. This is commonly the advice of housing authorities themselves. In the spirit of expanding access, online platforms such as New York City’s have tried to make applying easy, in many cases with just the click of a button (although paper applications are typically accepted as well).
But when lots of people are applying for many units, including ones whose configuration or location they feel lukewarm about, lotteries can be deeply inefficient. Because of the luck of the draw, I may win a spot in your first-choice development, and you may win a spot in mine. Then, generally speaking, there is no practical way for us to swap. Indeed, affordable units might become golden handcuffs: When moving out of one means giving up a heavy discount, people have massive incentives to stay put, even when they’d much rather move neighborhoods or have a bigger or smaller unit.
Improvements in lottery design could improve this weakness. One solution is to batch lotteries on a regular basis, say every two or three months, and let people rank their preferences for developments so that they have a higher chance of matching with the apartments they desire most. New York City and other places use similar centralized clearinghouses for seats in public schools, and the systems have lots of desirable properties.
Another option is to give applicants extra entries each year that they can put toward developments that particularly interest them. This design—much like a charity raffle where you can enter multiple tickets in the drawing for the prize that you want most—at least allows people to express the intensity of their preferences.
But although these improvements can allocate the affordable apartments more efficiently, they will not make those units any less scarce. And cities cannot simply conjure up more. To build their own below-market-rate units—as New York mayoral front-runner Zohran Mamdani has promised to do on a grand scale—they’ll need to redirect money from other priorities. Require too many affordable units from developers of new apartment buildings, and those projects become unprofitable and won’t be built at all.
Jacob Anbinder: New York NIMBYs turn against democracy
Ultimately, cities and their residents need to adjust their expectations. Currently, many municipal officials would rather tolerate the injustices of a housing shortage than stare down neighborhood groups that, in cities and towns across the country, have the power to delay proposed apartment construction for years or kill it entirely, creating housing shortages that drive up rents. Not wanting to look like Scrooges, NIMBY neighbors who insist—despite extensive evidence to the contrary—that market-rate housing will fuel gentrification may grudgingly assent to a project that includes affordable units.
Lottery apartments simply aren’t a sufficient answer to a housing crunch. The only reliable way to deliver widespread affordability—and spare urbanites from the cruelty of hidden markets—is to expand supply to lower housing costs across the board.

14,2025-10-29,"Uber said Wednesday that the San Francisco Bay Area will be the first market for its specially built autonomous taxi, which is expected to launch in late 2026
Uber said Wednesday that the San Francisco Bay Area will be the first market for its specially built autonomous taxi, which is expected to launch in late 2026.
The San Francisco-based ride-hailing company said in July it was developing a robotaxi with the electric car company Lucid and the self-driving technology company Nuro Inc. The vehicle is exclusive to Uber but is based on the Lucid Gravity SUV.
Uber said Lucid recently delivered test vehicles to Nuro. Uber said it plans to have 100 test vehicles on the road in the coming months.
Within six years, Uber said it plans to deploy 20,000 or more Lucid-based autonomous taxis in multiple locations. The vehicles will be available to riders through the Uber app.
Uber is working with multiple companies to speed the deployment of autonomous taxis.
On Tuesday, Uber said it’s also developing robotaxis with the tech company Nvidia and the automaker Stellantis. Uber said Tuesday that in 2028, Stellantis expects to start production of at least 5,000 vehicles powered by Nvidia software for autonomous taxi operations in the U.S.
And last week, Uber said it has begun offering autonomous taxi rides in Saudi Arabia as part of a partnership with WeRide, a Chinese autonomous tech company.
Autonomous taxis aren’t new, but as the world’s largest ride-hailing service, Uber’s adoption of them is significant. Uber operates in 15,000 cities in more than 70 countries.
Waymo, which is owned by Google parent Alphabet, has been testing autonomous taxis for years. Those taxis are currently available in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Austin. Waymo said earlier this month it plans to expand to London next year.
Uber is partnering with Waymo on autonomous taxis in Austin.

Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood highlighted a record $34.9 billion in spending on infrastructure to meet AI demand and the company's new OpenAI deal in an internal memo to company employees following earnings on Wednesday.
Microsoft reported revenue of $77.7 billion for the first quarter of its fiscal year ending in September, exceeding Wall Street expectations. Microsoft's stock fell more than 3% in after-hours trading, amid signs that demand for AI and cloud computing resources is exceeding the company's supply. 
 An Azure outage preceded the earnings release. Investors are also broadly worried about whether Big Tech's massive spending on AI infrastructure will pay off.
Hood sends out these emails every quarter when Microsoft discloses its financials. The memos mostly rehash what the company reports publicly, such as how revenue and profit are growing, but often they show what developments the executive deems most important.
In this quarter's memo, Hood called out the company's record $34.9 billion in spending on computing resources like GPUs, CPUs, and datacenter infrastructure to ""expand capacity and support strong demand signals we see."" Microsoft forecasted that it would spend $30 billion in capex in the first quarter. 
""Demand continues to accelerate, and we're investing to capture the opportunity ahead,"" Hood wrote. ""Across teams, we're bringing new products to market and adding capacity at record speed to deliver meaningful impact for our customers.""
The earnings release comes after Microsoft and OpenAI signed a new deal. Microsoft gets a 27% stake in OpenAI's for-profit business, valued at about $135 billion, and gives up the right to first refusal to provide new computing resources under the deal.
Hood's email called the deal ""another big step forward in a partnership that's been game-changing for our industry,"" but said it had no impact on the results since the companies signed the deal after the quarter closed.
Team,
This afternoon, we announced our first-quarter financial results. We exceeded Wall Street expectations, growing revenue 18% to $77.7 billion and operating income by 24% to $38.0 billion — a strong start to the fiscal year with continued momentum and share gains across many of our businesses.
Yesterday, we signed a new agreement with OpenAI — another big step forward in a partnership that's been game-changing for our industry. Our Q1 results do not include any impact from this new agreement, as it was signed after the quarter ended.
Microsoft Cloud revenue was $49.1 billion, growing 26% (25% in constant currency), driven by accelerating demand and the trust customers place in us to power their innovation, growth, and transformation.
Across the company, there were many highlights this quarter, but a few for me stand out as reminders of the critical role our products and services play for our customers every day:
Investors tune in to our earnings call for the full details on this quarter and a look ahead to Q2. I recommend you do the same — it helps create shared context as we deliver on our commitments. Join live today at 2:30 PM Pacific, listen on-demand, or check the transcript on the Investor Relations website.
Then, mark your calendar for Ignite, November 18-21, a showcase of our latest innovations. The opening day keynote is the one to watch, with Judson, Scott, and Ryan highlighting how we're helping customers use AI and the Microsoft Cloud to drive real impact.
Finally, thank you. We've had a great start to our fiscal year, and there's nothing quite like being part of a winning team — focused, collaborative, and always pushing to do its best for our customers. Demand continues to accelerate, and we're investing to capture the opportunity ahead. Across teams, we're bringing new products to market and adding capacity at record speed to deliver meaningful impact for our customers. It's a defining time not only for our business, but for every organization — and we're only getting started.
With appreciation and gratitude,  
Amy

AI is reorienting the global economy in radical ways, and the effects are spreading from consumers to companies, says Bill McDermott, CEO of ServiceNow, an enterprise software giant.
McDermott, a veteran of the software industry who previously led European tech giant SAP, chatted with me as his company reported third-quarter results on Wednesday. We spoke about AI disruptions to the job market, the AI spending boom, and the threat of generative AI to the software industry.
The big Amazon layoffs this week have reignited concerns about the impact of this powerful new technology on the job market. McDermott said the economy will certainly undergo fundamental changes due to AI.
""AI is going to reorient the global economy,"" he told me in an interview.
Individual consumers have already benefited from this by having access to powerful AI chatbots and models that answer questions in new ways. Next, enterprises, such as companies, governments, and other large organizations, will see gains from this technology, the CEO said.
""This is the biggest breakthrough in enterprise technology in half a century,"" McDermott added.
For ServiceNow itself, the CEO said generative AI is encouraging the company to hire more in certain areas, while re-skilling existing staff.
""What good is AI if it doesn't serve the greater good of people?"" McDermott said. ""We use agents in support of our employees, which enable us to hire more people.""
ServiceNow is hiring ""feet on street,"" which includes salespeople, technology architects and designers, and forward-deployed engineers who can help companies set up new AI and other tech projects in weeks, he said.
""And we're retooling and reassessing the skills of every employee, and retraining people to build the workforce of the future,"" McDermott said.
With trillions of dollars being spent on AI infrastructure, I asked the ServiceNow CEO if he's seeing evidence of gains that would justify such heavy spending.
""Your point you make is right on,"" he responded, while saying that most digital transformation projects fail, and 95% of early corporate AI initiatives are not delivering a return on investment.
He said ServiceNow has built its software to help companies handle the complexity of new AI projects.
""Our platform is that single, clean pane of glass that overcomes digital transformation problems,"" McDermott said. ""It resides above that messy legacy data layer and works across functions and digital processes. No one has time to rip and replace all that legacy mess.""
ServiceNow shares have been pressured this year by concern about the potential impact of generative AI. Some investors worry that AI coding tools and similar technology could make it easier for companies to build their own software, rather than buying it from software-as-a-service vendors such as ServiceNow.
When I asked McDermott whether ServiceNow customers are building their own versions of the company's software, he was unruffled.
""No, they can't duplicate what they took 20 years to build,"" the CEO said.
ServiceNow offers enterprise features for IT, operations, employee, customer experience, and engineering on the same product, he said.
""That is not what OpenAI and Anthropic, or Gemini, do,"" he added. ""Companies are still running the ServiceNow platform to execute their business missions.""
ServiceNow delivered another strong quarter, raising its full-year outlook as demand for its AI-powered offerings accelerated. The company's board also approved a five-for-one stock split.
The company reported third-quarter subscription revenue of $3.3 billion, up 22% year-over-year. Revenue reached $3.4 billion, also a 22% increase. ServiceNow raised its 2025 guidance for subscription revenue, operating margin, and free cash flow.
McDermott credited the surge to companies accelerating their adoption of ServiceNow's AI capabilities. ServiceNow CFO Gina Mastantuono said that AI products, such as Now Assist, Workflow Data Fabric, and RaptorDB, have exceeded internal plans, showing strong uptake across both new and existing customers.
The company highlighted 103 deals worth more than $1 million in net new annual contract value and 553 customers exceeding $5 million.
ServiceNow also highlighted the success of its new AI Experience interface and the Zurich product for building scalable AI systems.
The company's investments in AI innovation and partnerships, spanning Nvidia, FedEx, and government agencies, show deepening integration of AI into enterprise workflows.

The Fed announced a quarter-percent cut Wednesday, even as the government shutdown disrupts major data releases.
The second rate reduction of the year is in alignment with expectations: CME FedWatch projected a near-100% chance of a cut before the meeting and the central bank previously penciled in cuts for its last two meetings of 2025 in its September economic projections.
The Federal Open Market Committee had to make a decision this month without a full economic picture. The government shutdown — which is approaching the one month mark — led to a delay of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' consumer price index inflation report until last Friday. The September jobs report still hasn't been released, and would have given updated unemployment and job creation numbers. 
The shutdown ""will weigh on economic activity,"" Chair Jerome Powell said at the press conference, but the impacts will likely resolve when the government reopens. ""This is a temporary state of affairs,"" he said.
Powell emphasized the importance of the Fed's dual mandate goal: maximum employment and tempered inflation. A second cut suggests a continuation of this strategy as the job market started to look softer over the summer.
""There is no risk-free path for policy as we navigate this tension between our employment and inflation goals,"" Powell said.
The government shutdown means that the Fed is missing key pieces of jobs data.
Without a September jobs report, Fed leaders had to lean on previous patterns in the labor market. Based on available public and private jobs data, Powell said labor market conditions ""have not changed much"" since last month. Job openings have declined in recent months and unemployment has crept up. 
Powell also noted the slowdown in labor supply, which he attributed to lower labor force participation and immigration. Over the summer, the number of Americans looking for work eclipsed the number of available roles. He said he's watching recent AI-related layoffs at major companies like Amazon ""very closely"" and ""it could absolutely have implications for job creation,"" though he said interest rates themselves have little to do with AI's growing role in the economy.
The consumer price index report came a couple of weeks late, but the Fed now has insight into price growth. The inflation measure rose slightly below the 3.1% forecast in September, hitting 3% for the first time since January as tariffs have gone into effect. The central bank's goal is to push inflation closer to 2% in the long run.
""You've seen goods prices increasing and that's really due to tariffs,"" Powell said, adding. ""Inflation away from tariffs is not too far from our 2% goal."" He said that the Fed is keeping its policy ""modestly restrictive"" to account for this uncertainty.
Powell is likely leaning on other economic indicators, too. Soft markers like consumer sentiment dipped in October, meaning that Americans are feeling less financially secure, though consumer spending appears relatively healthy.
Those other indicators, which also include the informal surveys that the Fed regularly publishes in its Beige Book, could give some insight into the state of the economy. ""It doesn't replace the government data, but it gives us a picture,"" Powell said. ""If something material were happening, I think we would be able to pick that up. But I don't think we will have a very granular understanding of the economy while this data is not available.""
Congress has not yet reached a budget agreement, and it's unclear when the government will reopen.
The Fed has been uncharacteristically divided in recent decisions.
Fed newcomer Stephen Miran preferred a half-percentage point cut over October's quarter-point decision and governor Jeffrey Schmid wanted to hold rates steady.
Powell added during Wednesday's press conference that there are ""strongly differing views"" from the committee about how the Fed should act in December. He continued, ""Now we're 150 basis points closer to neutral than we were a year ago, and there's a growing chorus of feeling like maybe this is where we should at least wait a cycle."" He said the government shutdown is pushing some committee members to be more cautious. ""What do you do when driving through the fog?"" he added. ""You slow down.""
He said a rate change in December is ""not a forgone conclusion, far from it"" and ""policy is not on a preset course.""
In the September meeting, a few committee members indicated their dissent toward Powell's restrictive policy patterns earlier this year, and one member called for a 1.25% rate reduction by the end of the year last month — far more than any other voting members. Minutes from the meeting also show Fed governor Michelle Bowman wanted a deeper rate cut.
Powell has faced mounting political pressure from the Trump administration. The president has called on the Fed to cut rates: ""I really believe that Jerome 'Too Late' Powell is an OBSTRUCTIONIST!"" he wrote in an October 1 Truth Social post.
And, personnel changes on the Federal Open Market Committee could give the White House more sway over monetary policy. Miran, chair of the White House's Council of Economic Advisors and Trump appointee, was confirmed as a new Fed governor last month. He replaced Adriana Kugler, who resigned in August.
The president has called on Fed governor Lisa Cook to resign, alleging that she committed mortgage fraud. Cook remains in her seat and a September Reuters report found evidence the allegations were false.
Powell has maintained that the Fed is nonpartisan and will make decisions based solely on economic data. A sustained pattern of rate cuts could ease costs for consumers looking to borrow for mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards.
""Ultimately, lower rates will support demand and support hiring over time,"" he said. ""But we also have to be careful about this.""

Amazon is laying off thousands of employees, but there are still plenty of people working there. 
The 14,000 corporate workers being let go are about 0.9% of its roughly 1.6 million employees as of the end of last year. The Big Tech company expanded to over a million full-time and part-time employees in 2020, climbing to 1.6 million a year later when there was a lot of turnover in the overall US workforce as the economy reopened after the pandemic-induced recession.
Amazon's workforce has roughly tripled between 2017 and 2024.
Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, said in a message to workers on Tuesday that the new cuts ""are a continuation of this work to get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we're investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers' current and future needs.""
Amazon is just one large company that's laying off workers. UPS said in its third-quarter earnings that it has cut thousands of roles in the first nine months of the year.
Ernie Tedeschi, a nonresident senior fellow at The Budget Lab at Yale, told Business Insider that AI is a plausible factor in the current spate of layoffs. However, he added that the elevated hiring a few years ago is likely the larger reason.
""I see this as mainly a correction to pandemic-era dynamics rather than some new thing like AI that's striking these companies,"" Tedeschi said.
During the Great Resignation and the hot labor market following the big post-COVID reopening, workers felt empowered to move around a lot. That also meant companies opening up roles and seeking new hires.
Tedeschi said companies were able to maintain their beefed-up workforce for a while, but can't continue to do so in a more uncertain period.
""The other shoe is dropping, and they have to cost optimize and let some of those people go,"" Tedeschi said.
Claudia Sahm, the chief economist for New Century Advisors, told Business Insider that the US is in a low-hire, low-fire job market, following a high-hire market with high quits just a few years ago.
""We've just had some pretty dramatic changes in the labor market in recent years,"" Sahm said.
Some of the laid-off Amazon workers could end up finding a new role at the company. Galetti said in the Tuesday message that the company is ""offering most employees 90 days to look for a new role internally.""

When it comes to real estate, Connor Swofford and Pieter Louw know exactly what they're looking for: multifamily properties with three to 10 units in Buffalo that need a little TLC.
The childhood friends, who met in seventh grade in Indiana, started buying property together as a side project in October 2024. Despite living hundreds of miles apart — Swofford is a startup consultant in Charleston, and Louw is a real estate agent in Buffalo — and committing no more than 10 hours a week to their joint portfolio, they grew to 24 units in less than 12 months.
""It was just supposed to be this little fun thing that we do, and that's still what it is, but it's grown into something bigger than I think we might have both expected it to,"" Louw told Business Insider.
They've scaled quickly — and without having to use much of their own savings — thanks to creative financing strategies, their combined skillset, and a clear strategy that centers on multifamilies in one of the nation's hottest housing markets.
Swofford and Louw's first joint deal was a three-unit property — and they've continued to buy multifamilies ever since. These are single buildings that are divided to house more than one family living separately.
While they purchased a few duplexes early on, they're now shying away from doubles and focusing on bigger multifamilies with at least three units.
""The cash flow and cap rates are a lot better,"" said Louw, at least in their market. ""Just looking at the numbers over the last year, it's a more lucrative and safe investment.""
Buying multifamilies especially makes sense for Swofford and Louw, who have used the BRRRR (buy, rehab, rent, refinance, repeat) method to scale. This strategy involves buying a distressed property and renovating it, but they look for multifamilies that don't need a full rehab and have at least one livable unit. That way, they can start bringing in rental income immediately.
Louw gives the example of their most recent acquisition, a five-unit property: ""Two of the units are occupied and we're redoing the other three, so those two units are covering our monthly expenses while we're redoing the others.""
Managing a multifamily, rather than a single-family home, is more efficient from a time and money perspective, he added: ""The plumber just goes from one to the next. The electrician follows behind."" In general, ""the amount of different job sites we can minimize just makes it more efficient across the board and also keeps me from having a drive around the entire city.""
Buffalo makes sense specifically for Swofford and Louw, as Louw has been living there for a decade and has established connections with contractors, real estate agents, and other investors.
It's also a market where their ideal property type, multifamily, is ""extremely common,"" explained Louw. 
""At the turn of the 19th century, Buffalo was one of the richest cities in the world because pretty much anything that had to go out west had to come through the canal system, so there were a lot of families moving here to work. And with big families, the theme back then was separation of living space but being in the same home.""
Buffalo is also simply a good place to buy real estate right now. Online brokerage Zillow dubbed it the ""hottest"" market in 2024 and 2025, thanks to its affordability and job growth.
""I moved here 10 years ago, honestly, at the best time. It was really when the rejuvenation of Buffalo started,"" said Louw. ""It's classic steel city, where in the '70s and '80s, they saw a huge decline in population as the factories closed down and their production moved to China. So, the average home price in Buffalo 10 years ago was ridiculously low compared to the national average.""
Home prices are playing catch-up, he said, but it's still a much more affordable market than other populous US cities. And, more and more young professionals are moving to Buffalo.
Louw points to the New Yorkers, who, enabled by post-COVID remote work policies, migrated to smaller, more affordable cities like Buffalo. Plus, thanks to programs like 43North, which invests $5 million annually to recruit high-growth companies to Buffalo, ""we have all these young adults coming in that are making good money,"" he said.
As a result, ""we have a lot of people that want these higher-end rentals that we're offering.""
It's not worth it to him and Swofford to start looking in different markets, at least for now. They want their joint portfolio to continue feeling like a side project.
""We're scaling phenomenally, but we don't want it to get to the point where it detracts from our other careers that we have going on and becomes another stress or too consuming,"" said Louw.
He added: ""For the foreseeable future, we're all in on Buffalo.""

By 8:30 a.m. on a crisp morning in early October, a rooftop in Indiranagar, a leafy Bengaluru neighborhood that is home to some of India's most prominent startups and venture firms, was already overflowing.
More than 200 founders and developers packed into Lightspeed Venture Partners' office for an early morning session with Anthropic executives Chloe Ho, Guillume Princen, and Daniel Delaney, who were being interviewed by Hemant Mohapatra, a partner at the firm. Some people watched on a screen from an overflow room nearby.
When Mohapatra asked how many in the audience had used Anthropic's chatbot, Claude, nearly every hand in the room went up.
Anthropic was drawn to India's technical talent, its CEO Dario Amodei had announced days earlier in a blog post, saying that the company will open its first India office in Bengaluru early next year. The country, he said, would ""play a central role"" in how AI develops ""globally and democratically."" Later in the month, Amodei would meet with India's prime minister, Narendra Modi, to discuss the future of AI for ""over a billion people.""
Anthropic isn't alone. In recent months, American AI companies, such as OpenAI and Perplexity, have also steadily expanded their footprint in India, the world's largest open internet market outside the US. The race isn't just for users. It's for engineers, enterprise customers, and a chance to shape how AI is built and governed in one of the world's largest democracies.
OpenAI, whose leader, Sam Altman, has already met with Modi several times over the past two years, plans to open its first office in India by the end of the year and has already made several hires, including heads of government relations and social media. This week, it announced that it would make an India-specific ChatGPT plan free to everyone in the country for a year, starting in November.
great conversation with @narendramodi discussing india's incredible tech ecosystem and how the country can benefit from ai.really enjoyed all my meetings with people in the @PMOIndia. pic.twitter.com/EzxVD0UMDM
In July, San Francisco-based AI search startup Perplexity announced it would give away a free year of its Pro plan to all 360 million customers of Airtel, one of India's largest telecom giants.
These AI companies follow the footsteps of Western tech giants such as Google, Meta, and Amazon, which have invested billions over the past decade to target what they refer to as the ""next billion users."" They aimed to get hundreds of millions of Indians coming online for the first time hooked on their products by wooing them with free internet, low-cost Android phones, and data-light versions of their apps.
For the big AI companies, however, ""India is not the 'next billion users' market. It's the 'first billion users' market,"" Rajan Anandan, managing director at VC firm Peak XV Partners and previously the head of Google in India, told Business Insider.
This year, India is expected to have more than 900 million internet users, according to a report from the Internet and Mobile Association of India and research firm Kantar. For Western AI companies, that scale can become a strategic advantage. OpenAI describes India as its fastest-growing market outside the US. Anthropic says that India ranks second globally in the consumer usage of Claude.
It's a level of engagement that echoes an earlier era of Silicon Valley's expansion beyond the US. By the time Anadan left Google in 2019, he said that India was the single largest market for all the company's largest products.
""If you want to build a global consumer technology company today, you have to be in India,"" Anandan said. ""If you're not, it's highly likely that five years from now, it'll be too late.""
10 years after Big Tech first started expanding in India, it's a vastly different market. This time, the main customers aren't just first-time internet users. They're also established local companies and experienced developers. Global AI firms are ""re-evaluating India's role"" in their own growth strategies, says Prayank Swaroop, a partner at Accel, which also hosted an Anthropic event in Bangalore.
""It's a community that's far more mature now, "" Swaroop said.
Western tech companies are also racing to build the infrastructure needed to power AI in India.
Earlier this month, Alphabet announced it would spend $15 billion to build a data center campus in the country, its largest single investment in India to date. Bloomberg reported that OpenAI is scouting local partners in India for a facility as part of its global Stargate data center expansion, a project that could become one of India's largest AI data centers.
The investments show how India's push to build its own computing backbone is converging with Western AI firms that increasingly see the country as both a market and a strategic hub.
This isn't just a land grab among American firms. India has entered the chat. In March 2024, the government approved a five-year plan, known as the IndiaAI Mission, backed by $1.2 billion, to develop its own AI ecosystem from the ground up.
The ambitions are vast: to create a state-backed computing network with more than 10,000 GPUs for startups and researchers, to bankroll homegrown AI models trained on India's 22 official languages, and to dramatically scale up the country's AI workforce.
Already, Indian startups are churning out their own language models, such as Sarvam-1, which supports 10 Indian languages, and Project Indus, which can handle 40 dialects of Hindi.
""India is becoming the place where AI gets operationalized,"" Swaroop told Business Insider. ""It's where scale meets ingenuity.""
Some Indian technologies worry that the country is once again opening its doors to foreign tech firms without asking what it's getting in return.
""I don't want to be a country that just gives up data or increases sales for yet another US company,"" Saurav Agarwal, a Bengaluru-based developer who attended the Anthropic event organized by Lightspeed, told Business Insider. ""It feels like a lot of taking and not enough giving.""
Agarwal said that what unsettled him the most at the session was that the company's executives spoke enthusiastically about policy partnerships and business deals, and not enough about hiring engineers in India.
""They mentioned legal, partnerships, and policy,"" he said. ""But nobody mentioned developers.""
That absence, to him, underscored a familiar imbalance: global firms eager to tap into India's user base — not necessarily to build technical capacity within the country.
""When I see companies like Anthropic entering India, I see that they want to get access to our data, our culture. They're here to do business. But if they're not contributing to GDP either through jobs or real R&D, it doesn't make sense,"" Agarwal said.
India is the only large, unfettered internet market where Silicon Valley companies can grow beyond the US. India's YouTube is YouTube; its Instagram is Instagram; and its Google is Google. Unlike China, there are no meaningful homegrown alternatives.
Without stronger policy guardrails, Agarwal worries that India is putting itself at risk by supplying raw materials and labor to Western models instead of building its own with a genuine commitment.
Western tech companies have a history of moving fast and breaking things in India. In the last few years, people have been killed in mob lynchings fueled by rumors on WhatsApp, and hate speech has flourished on X, deepening political and religious divides in the country.
As AI companies scale up in India, they're bringing new forms of risk with them. A recent investigation by MIT Technology Review found that OpenAI's GPT-5 model exhibited widespread caste bias, choosing stereotypical answers 76% of the time. OpenAI's image generator, Sora, showed similar bias, producing caste-coded imagery that reflected long-standing social hierarchies, the report said.
""If companies like Anthropic enter India and actually hire good people, that could shift us from a services economy to an AI development economy,"" said Agarwal. ""But if it's just offices and partnerships, it's not wealth creation — it's extraction.""
Anandan, the former head of Google in India, doesn't share these worries. He added that the leader of digital payments in India is a homegrown payment infrastructure called Unified Payments Interface (UPI), which processes more transactions than Visa does worldwide. To Anandan, it's proof that India doesn't always follow Silicon Valley's playbook. Sometimes, it writes its own.
He said that India's largest startups have top talent and that AI will follow a similar pattern: mass adoption driven by affordability and local innovation.
""We have world-class talent now — product managers, engineers, growth marketers — who came up at companies like Flipkart, Google, Blinkit, and ShareChat,"" Anandan said. ""We didn't have that 10 years ago.""

Nothing, the startup behind distinctive transparent wireless earbuds and the polarizing Phone 3 phone, is swimming downstream to the budget market, and it’s not through its CMF subsidiary. As teased earlier this week, the company has just announced the Phone 3a Lite, a lower-priced Android phone with a 6.77-inch screen that starts at 249 euros (about $290 USD).
If you didn’t like the Phone 3’s oddball camera array, you may not like the Phone 3a Lite. The rear design is toned down, but the triple-lens camera system and all the exposed screws may still trigger your trypophobia (that’s fear of a cluster of holes). At least you’ll get an aluminum frame and an IP54 rating. There’s also an Essential Key that uses AI to surface all the screenshots, notes, and audio recordings you’ve saved in the Essential Space.
Specs-wise, the Phone 3a Lite looks decent on paper. It has a 6.77-inch AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate; the screen resolution is 2,392 x 1,080 and supports 10-bit color and 2,160Hz PWM (pulse width modulation) dimming, which reduces flickering at lower brightness levels.
For the cameras, there are three lenses: a 50-megapixel main camera on the rear, an 8-megapixel ultrawide, and a macro camera with an unspecified resolution. There’s a 16-megapixel selfie camera on the front.
Under the hood, the budget phone is powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Pro chip with an 8-core CPU, 8GB of RAM, and up to 256GB of storage. And get thisâthere’s a microSD card slot for storage expansion up to 2TB. Huzzah! What we’ll need to test is how well the phone experience comes together with the Nothing OS 3.5 software experience. Nothing loves to tout fast and smooth performance, and I’m eager to see how far that goes on a phone with cut-back specs.
More concerning is how deep the “bloatware” that’s preinstalled on the Phone 3a Lite goes. 9to5Google reports that there are six preinstalled third-party apps/services, including Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Meta App Installer, Meta App Manager, and Meta Services. The first three can be uninstalled, but the latter three can only be disabled, not removed entirely from the phone.
While this has drawn consternation from Nothing fans, the practice is not new. Budget and midrange phone makers have been preinstalled third-party apps and services with varying degrees of removability and disabling options for over a decade. This is how the prices of these phones stay low; apps and services pay the brand to preinstall these apps so that the cost of the build of materials (BOM) is sort of subsidized and not passed directly to consumers in the retail price. It’s icky to many, but in regions where budget and midrange phones are more popular, it’s nothing surprising.
Nothing also says the 5,000mAh battery “comfortably lasts almost 2 days with mixed use” and supports 33W fast charging. Funnily enough, the Phone 3a Lite supports 5W reverse wireless charging for juicing up accessories, but not full Qi wireless charging for the phone itself.
Located near the bottom of the phone’s back panel is a “Glyph Light.” This round LED is not the same Glyph lighting first introduced on the Phone 1 and then later scrapped in the latest Phone 3 for the Glyph Matrix screen. It’s more like a return to the LED notification lights on early Android phones with a few new upgrades. Nothing says you can flip the phone over for silent notifications, have the Glyph Light glow for essential contact and app notifications, and flash when counting down for timer-based photos. The Glyph Light can also be customized for light sequences synced to Nothing’s own sounds.
The Phone 3a Lite is available starting today, Oct. 29, in white or black models. An 8GB RAM + 128GB storage model costs â¬249 in the EU and Â£249 in the U.K. A version with the same 8GB RAM and 256GB of storage is â¬279 in the EU and Â£279 in the U.K. That’s about $290 and $330 USD, respectively, based on the exchange rate from euros; pricing will be slightly higher converted from British pounds.
For us Americans, Nothing says the Phone 3a Lite “will not be available in North America.” Womp, womp.

Not even four months after American technology company Nvidia rode the AI surge to become the world’s first $4 trillion company, it has become the first ever to cross the $5 trillion threshold. 
As of early this morning, Nvidia’s share price reached over $212, which put its total market cap well over $5 trillion. At the time of writing, the company’s stock price has decreased slightly to just under $207, keeping its market cap at $5.02 trillion. The company’s 52-week high stock price is $212.19, which Bloomberg reports was achieved around 11 AM ET today. 
This is just the latest chapter in Nvidia’s meteoric rise. While long a successful technology company and chipmaker, Nvidia has significantly benefited from the ongoing AI arms race. The company’s stock price has increased from around $12 to its high watermark of $212.19 over the past five years, with the largest total value gains occurring since the start of 2024, when Nvidia’s stock was around $50. Since 2022, Nvidia’s stock has gone up by over 1,300 percent. 
Nvidia went from dramatically trailing the valuations of monolithic presences in the tech space like Alphabet, Microsoft, and Apple to beating them all across $4 trillion and now $5 trillion valuation thresholds. 
The landmark accomplishment this morning is hot on the heels of Nvidia’s announcement that it had bought $1 billion in Nokia shares to help accelerate Nvidia’s AI-RAN innovations and help the company transition from 5G to 6G networking infrastructure. Obviously, buying $1 billion in shares of a company like Nokia instantly increases Nvidia’s own value by a commensurate amount, but this is nonetheless a monumental moment in the U.S. corporate landscape. 
“Nvidia has become the most-important stock in a bull market that’s been driven by optimism for AI to revolutionize the global economy,” Bloomberg reports. The publication adds that Nvidia’s stock accounts for about 20% of the S&P 500 Index’s 17% gains so far this year. 
The market is clearly putting significant faith in artificial intelligence’s value and its potential transformational power. However, it remains unclear whether AI will primarily create positive cultural and societal change and who will benefit the most from it. Perhaps as importantly, there is justifiable concern about who will be harmed by its continued development. There remains significant skepticism surrounding AI and ongoing worry that it is just another, bigger dot-com-esque bubble waiting to burst.

While AI startups are riding a wave of record valuations, a Sequoia Capital partner said investors should examine the numbers more closely.
Alfred Lin, a partner at Sequoia Capital, said on an episode of the ""Sourcery"" podcast published Monday that the AI boom has produced a surge of what he calls ""experimental revenue"" — short-term deals and pilot programs that help startups fund research but might not last.
""People are willing to experiment because they don't want to be left behind in AI,"" he said.
""That's good and bad. It's great for founders, they get to finance some of their R&D with revenue. It's bad because it's pilot revenue. It may go away,"" he added.
Lin, who has backed companies like DoorDash and Airbnb, said some startups are annualizing that pilot revenue and calling it recurring revenue.
""A lot of founders know it's a joke, but they don't have any problems just taking whatever month's revenue is, that's all pilot revenue, and multiplying by 12,"" he said.
Revenue quality matters, like whether customers stick around after the pilot. ""Retention is so important,"" Lin said.
""I prefer to have slower growth quality revenue than fast growth non-quality revenue,"" he added.
Lin also said revenue may not be the best proof of traction for a startup.
""You have to look at the underlying metrics,"" he said, adding that some of the best companies took time to build before they hit significant revenue growth.
""The measurement should be about the velocity of the company, not just revenue growth.""
Lin did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.
Lin's comments come amid growing debate over whether the AI boom could end like the dot-com crash.
AI startups have been raising record amounts of money and soaring in valuations. Replit, which builds tools to let users code apps and websites with AI, expects to top $1 billion in revenue by next year, its CEO and founder, Amjad Masad, told Business Insider last week. That's about four times its current annual sales of $240 million.
Several investors have warned that the AI market might be overheating and that the market is at risk of going the way of the dot-com bubble burst.
Tech guru Erik Gordon told Business Insider in August that the AI bubble could dwarf the dot-com collapse because of its greater scale.
Gordon, an entrepreneurship professor researching financial markets and technology at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business, said in 2022 that AI is an ""order-of-magnitude overvaluation bubble.""
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in August that it's ""insane"" and ""not rational"" that some tiny AI startups are getting funding at high valuations.
Others disagree. ""Shark Tank"" investor Kevin O'Leary told Business Insider last month that the AI market isn't headed for a dot-com-style meltdown.
AI wasn't ""the same hype that the internet bubble was, because today, you actually can see the productivity and measure it on a dollar-by-dollar basis,"" he said.

24,2025-10-29,"US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are set to meet on Thursday, with their countries appearing closer than ever to a trade deal.  
Officials on both sides said earlier this week that they had reached a consensus ""to address their respective concerns"". US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent went as far as to say that he did not expect the 100% levy Trump had threatened to impose on Chinese goods to take effect.
That's far from the only concern. The world's two biggest economies are competing over everything - from tit-for-tat tariffs, to access to the critical minerals and semiconductors that underpin advanced manufacturing. 
Even TikTok, the hugely popular Chinese-owned app, has become a long-running source of tension because of national security concerns. Observers are expecting Trump and Xi to finalise the deal on the sale of TikTok's US operations when they come face to face.
The meeting is expected to happen at the Gimhae International Airport in the South Korean city of Busan - soon after Xi arrives in the country for the Apec summit, and just before Trump flies out. 
Despite the obscure setting, it is a high-stakes meeting. ""This is the meeting that resets globalisation in a post-Covid era,"" says economist Prof Tim Harcourt from the University of Technology Sydney.
It took 10 months - of retaliatory tariffs, a shaky truce, uncertainty for manufacturers and businesses world over - for Trump and Xi to meet.
So, how did we get here? 
Trump kicked off his trade war with China well before ""Liberation Day"" in April - the date on which he unveiled levies on most countries, hitting both allies and foes. 
China has long been in his crosshairs - for what he described as unfair trade practices - and was hit with tariffs in his first term too. 
Early in his second term, in February, he announced 10% tariffs on all Chinese imports in - on top of those that already existed from his previous term. 
Beijing shot back with its own levies, and Trump responded again, taking US tariffs on China to 20% . 
And then on ""Liberation Day"" Trump threatened China with an additional 34% levy.  The tit-for-tat measures continued, with US tariffs reaching 145%, while Chinese levies touched 125%. 
The staggering numbers left manufacturers and importers reeling and uncertain. Stock piled up in warehouses in China, as alarmed American businesses wondered how to find alternate supply chains overnight.   
Meanwhile, Trump's global tariffs offensive also took aim at ""transshipments"" - Chinese-made goods that were being re-routed through other countries, such as Vietnam. 
But Beijing did not back down. China was open to dialogue, it said again and again. But just as clear was that it was willing to take the pain. 
It also managed to inflict pain. For instance, it targeted a key vote base of Trump's - farmers - when it began heaping levies on American agricultural imports, such as soybeans. 
Trump's attempts to cut off US companies, from Apple to Walmart, from Chinese manufacturing were also weakened by exemptions - and that, in turn, boosted Beijing's confidence.   
In May, the two sides struck a fragile truce, agreeing to keep talking until they had a final deal. 
Even as the tariff talks continued, another sticking point in the US-China relationship returned: the fight over advanced chips, which go into everything from smartphones to AI applications. 
They are essential for China's plan to transform its economy from the ""world's factory"" for basic products to the home for cutting-edge tech. And experts largely agree that despite huge talent, China's semiconductor industry trails behind that of the US.
So, the White House has been trying to limit China's access to the most advanced chips. This was happening even before Trump, but his administration has held on that tight leash, allowing only less-advanced semiconductors to be shipped to China.
At the heart of this strategy has been Nvidia, the world's most valuable company  - the chips it designs are widely regarded by the industry as the gold standard. China is a big enough market - earning it billions - that the firm even agreed to pay the US government 15% of its China sales in return for export licenses. 
But Beijing then surprised the US by reportedly telling local firms not to buy from chips from America. Instead it rallied its industries around domestic manufacturers like Alibaba and Huawei.
Beijing also launched an anti-monopoly probe into Nvidia.
The measures underline what Beijing has long intended: to become more self-reliant, China policy analyst Stefanie Kam from the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies says. 
It has been investing heavily in tech and AI, encouraging firms to innovate and make big bets. This ability to use ""state-craft"" to rally specific sectors of the economy is partly what has made China appear more resilient during the negotiations with the US, she adds.
China is playing the long game, analysts believe - so rather than rush into a deal which may or may not last, it is investing in building industries that are less reliant on the West.
But its decision to play a long game doesn't necessarily mean China doesn't want a deal with the US.
There are limitations to Beijing's powers, says Prof Harcourt, noting its economic challenges at home, including unemployment, weak spending and a property crisis.
China's leadership isn't constrained by democratic elections but it still faces pressure to keep its middle-class prosperous and ensure political stability, he noted.
""Washington would be fully aware of China's domestic difficulties... There is still pressure on China and they wouldn't want a long-term severe trade war.""
What Xi does want is to be able to walk into the talks with a strong hand. And so in October, China went on the offensive by tightening controls over rare earth exports. 
The country has a near-monopoly in the processing of the critical minerals that go into electronics, green energy tech and military equipment like fighter jets.
It was a pivotal moment in the trade war. 
The US's tech curbs threaten to slow China's progress, but restricting rare earths could halt entire industries, says Naoise McDonagh from Australia's Edith Cowan University.
The Chinese announcement on rare earths stunned the White House. Especially because it came after Trump said that the two sides had reached an agreement on the sale of TikTok's US business. A top US trade official called it a ""betrayal"" of the US-China truce.
The move served as a stark reminder of American dependence on Chinese resources. And it prompted a series of agreements between the US and Australia, Malaysia and Japan, all focused on US access to rare earths - a form of ""insurance"" for Washington to get hold of the minerals outside China, according to Prof Harcourt.
These deals happened as Trump and US negotiators sought to ease tensions with Beijing, and met with Chinese officials to set up Thursday's meeting.
The differences are huge, and the rivalry runs deep but ""there are lower-hanging fruits"", according to Prof Kam, such as China delaying its rare earth export curbs in exchange for lower tariffs.
The day before the talks, Beijing had bought the first cargoes of soybeans this season, Reuters reported - a win for Trump and American farmers. In return, Xi is expected to seek some relief from the restrictions on chip sales to China. 
The final green light on the TikTok deal, which analysts are expecting, would be another win for Trump.
However fragile a deal might be, it could ""narrow the risk"" of any unexpected decisions in the months ahead, Prof Kam adds.
Prof Harcourt agrees: ""I still think the Trump administration is pretty erratic with tariffs... But the talks could smooth the waters.""
But, he warns, no truce between the US and China will last forever.
The suspected drug traffickers were killed in an escalating conflict taking place at sea. 
Sales of Korean skincare treatments continue to soar, but some are now made by overseas companies.
The BBC's Bernd Debusmann looks at video clips of the strikes that have killed at least 57 people in the Caribbean and Pacific.
The US government shutdown continues, with Republicans and Democrats no closer to ending their budget standoff.
Seoul will also invest $350bn in the US as part of the deal, which Donald Trump says is ""pretty much finalised"".

26,2025-10-29,"In an new investor note, Bank of America maintained its “Buy” rating on Apple and raised its price target, citing strong iPhone 17 sales and long-term AI potential. Here are the details.
Following last August’s investor note, in which Bank of America Research analyst Wamsi Mohani warned against tempered iPhone 17 expectations, today’s investor note had a more optimistic tone, as reported by CNBC:
Heading into the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter earnings release on Thursday, Mohan sees strength in sales of the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max and raised his iPhone unit estimates. The analyst expects the company to guide year-over-year revenue growth for its current quarter in the high single digits.
Today’s note also raises Apple’s stock price target to $320, up from $250 in August. In practice, that would mean a 19.4% bump compared with the current $268.22 stock price.
Alongside a stronger demand for the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro than Mohan had anticipated, he also cited AI as a major driver behind the new price target, as he believes the company will eventually become a leader in the field:
“We consider the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on Apple’s revenues, enhancing potential new product offerings (AI augmented eye-wear, in-house AI robots/smart home), while potentially being disruptive in other cases (AI impact on traditional search revenues).”
Apple’s stock is up 10% so far in 2025, despite a steep drop in April amid uncertainty over the start of Trump’s trade war. Since its $174 low, the stock has climbed 56% to date.

Sometimes, when it comes to personal audio products, midrange really hits the sweet spot. Sure, you could spend $299 on Bose’s ridiculously effective active noise cancellation (ANC) by buying the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd Gen), or ball out on hi-fi audio with the equally expensive Technics EAH-AZ100, but maybe you just want enoughÂ out of your wireless earbuds, not the most.
For those folks, there are luckily lots of options in the midrange, including the recently released Google Pixel Buds 2a and the slightly older (by a few months) OnePlus Buds 4. Both of these wireless earbuds retail for the same $130, but having tested both pairs, I can tell you right now that there are some notable differences you should be aware of before buying. If you’re in the market for midrange, here’s what you need to know if these are the two pairs of wireless earbuds on your radar.
One of the biggest differences you’re going to notice is in the sound departmentâor at least, that was one area that jumped out to me. Iâve never been super impressed with the sound of Google’s A-series Pixel Buds (same goes for the Pixel Buds Pro, which I’ve also tested), but I donât actively dislike the tuning either.
While some people may describe the Pixel Buds 2a sound as “well-balanced,” I find that these wireless earbuds can sound a little flat at times. They still pull their weight, but sometimes I want more, especially in the low end, which is exactly where the OnePlus Buds 4 shine. Unlike Google’s Pixel Buds 2a, the OnePlus Buds 4 go big on bass, making electronic music and other low-end-heavy tunes feel bigger and more bombastic. I suspect this is the OnePlus Buds 4 dual-driver setup at work.
You’re not going to always need a lot of bass, depending on what genres of music you listen to, but it’s still nice to have, and I do feel like the emphasis on the low end gives the OnePlus Buds 4 an edge. OnePlus’ midrange wireless earbuds make the soundstage feel wider without being drowned out by over-simulated low end, and for that reason, they’re my pick in this round.
I’ll be honest. Neither of these wireless earbuds are the best ANC wireless earbuds I’ve ever used, but they still do cancel noise, and that’s noteworthy in the midrange world. Sometimes, canceling noise isn’t all about ANC, though; it’s actually about the fit of the earbuds in your ears, and this is where things get interesting in the showdown.
While I don’t love the Google Pixel Buds 2a sound tuning, one thing I really do like is the general shape and fit of these wireless earbuds. That’s not just because they’re stemless; it’s because they come with a “stabilizer,” which is actually just a piece of plastic on the outside that can be twisted to adjust the fit in your ears. On top of making the fit better, I have a suspicion that this little plastic rim also blocks out additional sound while you’re listening.
Is it cheating to use passive noise cancellation in the ANC category? Maybe, but the fact of the matter is, the Pixel Buds 2a have a slight edge here. In fact, according to Google, the Pixel Buds 2a have 1.5x the ANC of the first-gen Pixel Buds Pro, which is a notable
Having worn both of these wireless earbuds on the subway in New York, you can trust me on this.
One of the most overlooked parts of a pair of wireless earbuds actually has nothing to do with how they sound but everything to do with how they feel. Wireless earbuds can be a pain to wear for long periods, so the more attention to ergonomics, the better. There’s a pretty big difference in these two pairs of wireless earbuds in how they look and also how they feel, and while neither is uncomfortable, the subtleties may make all the difference for you.
As I mentioned before, the Pixel Buds 2a really embody the “buds” part of wireless earbuds. Unlike the OnePlus Buds 4, they don’t have a stem, meaning they’re just buds with a tip that you put in your ears. Whether you appreciate that choice aesthetically will be a matter of preference, but one thing is certain, and that’s the fact that the stemless design does make them feel more stable in your ears.
Adding to that stability is a piece I mentioned previously called the “twist-to-adjust stabilizer” on the Pixel Buds 2a, which is just a plastic lip attached to the ear tips. It’s a small thing, but it does make the Pixel Buds 2a feel more secure when they’re in your ears and creates a tight seal. The Pixel Buds 2a also have the edge in the ear tip size department; Google’s wireless earbuds come with four different sizes, while the OnePlus Buds 4 come with three. Overall, it’s clear that Google paid a lot of attention to fit and feel, and I think that attention pays off in this case. The point here goes to Google.
While features aren’t always the most important piece of the puzzle, they can make a major difference depending on your priorities. If you’re really into AI, then the Pixel Buds 2a are your pick, since they allow for hands-free Gemini on an Android device and Gemini Live. If you’re more into sound-focused features like personalized EQ, the OnePlus Buds 4 are the clear winner here. Golden Sound, as OnePlus calls it, uses a companion app to test hearing in both your ears and then personalizes frequencies to your hearing.
Having tested Golden Sound for myself, I can say for certain there’s a big difference before and after the test, maybe even more so than comparable tuning tests from companies like Nothing. Both pairs of wireless earbuds have ANC, transparency modes for when you want to turn ANC off, but only the OnePlus Buds 4 currently have adaptive ANC, which adjusts levels based on noise in your environment. Speaking of ANC, the Pixel Buds 2a are rated for 7 hours with ANC activated, while the OnePlus Buds 4 are rated for 6, so Google has a slight edge here. Though the Pixel Buds 2a only have 20 hours of battery life in the case compared to OnePlus’ 24 hours. Neither pair has wireless charging.
Again, which pair of wireless earbuds speaks to you will be a matter of what your priorities are, but for me, I’d rather have more sound-focused features than AI features you’ll probably forget to use, so the OnePlus Buds 4 are getting my vote here, especially because Golden Sound works so well.
I’m going to make this one short. If you take one look at these wireless earbuds, you’ll notice a big difference. While the Pixel Buds 2a have a minimalist white case and matte plastic, the OnePlus Buds 4 have… gray. The case is gray; the buds are gray; there’s a lot of gray. They also come in “Zen Green,” but I’ve only seen the “Storm Gray” version in person. The Pixel Buds 2a, on the other hand, complement the minimalist white case with a pop of color (in my case, lavender), which I think looks pretty spiffy.
This is all going to be very subjective (maybe you want wireless earbuds that just don’t do a whole lot in the looks department), but the OnePlus Buds 4 objectively phone it in on design, so if you want something with a distinct look, Google’s Pixel Buds 2a are the obvious choice.
One of the main reasons you’d compare these two wireless earbuds is the price. Both pairs of wireless earbuds retail for $130, which makes them an obvious head-to-head, though OnePlus Buds 4 can be had for about $100 at the time of this writing, which gives them an edge. Obviously, which pair is worth it will depend on your priorities, but the OnePlus Buds 4 are a strong option and cheaper right now, so if you’re okay with the bland look and a different fit/feel, they’re the better value.
While Google’s Pixel Buds 2a excel in categories like ANC and comfort, OnePlus takes the lead in sound, features, and price point. If you’re in the market for a pair of wireless earbuds that you can pick up relatively cheaply, but don’t want to sacrifice sound, the OnePlus Buds 4 would be my recommendation, but that does come with a caveat. If you’re okay sacrificing sound for looks, Google’s Pixel Buds 2a are serviceable in the sound department and look a heck of a lot nicer. I suspect most will go for substance over style here, though, especially when the substance pick (OnePlus Buds 4 in this case) is actually cheaper.

META stock is up around 5% over the last eight days due to strong investor confidence ahead of its Q3 2025 earnings report. This investor optimism is fueled by expectations of strong AI-driven advertising revenue growth and the company's commitment to large-scale AI investments. 
The firm has accrued approximately $99 billion in value over the last 8 days, and its current market capitalization stands at roughly $1.9 trillion. The stock is 28.6% above its value at the close of 2024. This contrasts with year-to-date returns of 17.2% for the S&P 500.
META offers products that allow individuals to connect and share through various devices, such as mobile phones, PCs, VR headsets, wearables, and augmented reality, promoting connectivity anytime and anywhere. After this surge, is META still a buy – or is it time to secure profits? Dive deeper with Buy or Sell META.
Investing in a single stock can be precarious, yet there is significant value in a broader, diversified strategy. Should you purchase one stock that you favor or create a portfolio engineered to succeed across various market cycles? Our data indicates that the Trefis High Quality Portfolio has transformed stock-picking unpredictability into consistent market-beating performance. This portfolio is incorporated into the asset allocation plan of Empirical Asset Management — a Boston-based wealth management firm and Trefis partner — whose asset allocation framework generated positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P lost over 40% of its value.
The table below summarizes the returns for META stock compared to the S&P 500 index over various periods, including the current streak:
 What is the conclusion? Momentum frequently precedes conviction. A multi-day winning streak may indicate increasing investor confidence or trigger follow-on purchases. Monitoring such trends can assist you in riding the momentum, or help you prepare for a timely entry if the momentum wanes. Nonetheless, substantial gains can be followed by sharp reversals – but how has META acted following previous downturns? Check out META Dip Buyer Analysis to discover more.
Currently, there are 52 S&P constituents that have recorded 3 days or more of consecutive gains, and 80 constituents that have shown 3 days or more of consecutive losses.
While META stock appears appealing given its winning streak, investing solely in one stock without thorough and careful analysis can be risky. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has demonstrated a history of consistently outperforming its benchmark which includes all three — the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; it has experienced fewer ups and downs, as illustrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics."

Both QuantumScape and D-Wave Quantum have captivated investor interest with their innovative technologies and impressive 2025 returns of approximately 200% year-to-date. But if you were to select just one for the upcoming phase of the tech revolution, which would you choose?​
We believe that QuantumScape is the better option. Below, we explain why this leader in solid-state batteries surpasses the quantum computing frontrunner.
That said, if you’re looking for an opportunity with lower volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has significantly outperformed its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—achieving returns surpassing 105% since its inception. Why is that? On average, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with reduced risks compared to the benchmark index; less volatility, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
The primary question for both companies has consistently been: “When will this truly work?” QuantumScape has just provided a definitive answer. In September 2025, the company presented the world’s first live demonstration of an electric vehicle powered by solid-state batteries at IAA Mobility in Munich, showcasing a Ducati V21L motorcycle integrated with their QSE-5 cells.​
This wasn’t merely a lab test—it was a fully functional vehicle showcasing an energy density of 844Wh/L, achieving charging from 10% to 80% in just 12 minutes, along with continuous 10C output. D-Wave, despite having commercial systems available, still lacks mass-market applications that yield significant revenue.
While D-Wave discusses future potential, QuantumScape is following a tangible roadmap. The firm recently shipped its B1 samples utilizing the groundbreaking Cobra process in Q3 2025—a production technique that is 25 times more efficient than its predecessor. These samples are directly entering Volkswagen's vehicle program for 2026 road testing.​
The strength of the partnership underscores the narrative: Volkswagen’s PowerCo has just pledged up to $131 million in milestone-based funding over two years. Furthermore, Toyota is racing towards solid-state battery commercialization by 2027-2028, creating a huge market opportunity that QuantumScape is poised to capture.
This is where the figures become captivating. QuantumScape recorded its first-ever customer billings in Q3 2025 ($12.8 million), indicating a pivotal shift from exclusive R&D to commercial operations. D-Wave, despite being more advanced in commercialization, anticipates only about $3.12 million in quarterly revenue—barely enough to support a market cap exceeding $10 billion.
The global EV battery market vastly outstrips quantum computing applications in scale. With Toyota targeting 2027-2028 for solid-state battery vehicles and other manufacturers in alignment, QuantumScape stands at the forefront of a multi-trillion-dollar energy transition. D-Wave's quantum applications, despite their potential, remain niche and years away from widespread use.
It is vital to recognize that investing in these companies is far from certain success. Both QuantumScape and D-Wave Quantum encounter substantial, unique, and shared risks.
Let’s be frank—QuantumScape isn’t a certainty. The company’s most significant challenge lies in scaling: transitioning from successful lab samples to gigawatt-hour production at automotive levels remains unverified. If commercialization schedules are delayed, the stock's remarkable 180% gain this year might swiftly diminish. Additionally, competition is heating up, with established industry players such as Toyota and SK On quickly advancing their own solid-state battery technologies.
D-Wave confronts the existential danger of a “quantum winter”—a situation where practical quantum advantages take longer to emerge than anticipated. While D-Wave’s quantum annealing method is operational today, it risks being eclipsed by competitor gate-based quantum computers for a broad selection of future applications. With revenue still minimal and competition intensifying from tech giants like IBM and Google, D-Wave's initial advantage could be easily lost. Also see – What’s The Downside Risk For D-Wave Quantum Stock?
Both companies share significant vulnerabilities due to their financial positions:
Keep in mind, investing in a single stock without thorough analysis can be perilous. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to yield robust returns for investors. Why is this the case? The quarterly rebalanced combination of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided an adaptable strategy to maximize the benefits of favorable market conditions while minimizing losses when markets decline, as explained in RV Portfolio performance metrics.
In this comparison, QuantumScape emerges as the victor due to its clearer and more immediate pathway to substantial commercial validation within a broader addressable market.
While D-Wave was a pioneer in the commercial quantum computing field, QuantumScape is leading the energy storage revolution that will drive the next decade of transportation. QS shows tangible advancement towards commercial reality: the live vehicle demonstration, B1 sample shipments, and the Volkswagen partnership all align with a feasible 2027–2028 commercial timeline that corresponds with automotive industry needs.
In contrast, D-Wave's quantum applications, though technically impressive, still do not possess the immediate market appeal and revenue prospects currently visible for solid-state batteries. For investors looking to capitalize on genuinely transformative technologies, QuantumScape presents a more straightforward path to significant returns in a market that is already actively seeking the solution they are developing."
30,2025-10-29,"The latest rumors indicate we’re less than a year away from Apple’s first foldable iPhone debuting. And based on recent foldable market trends, it sounds like the iPhone Fold’s launch timing couldn’t be better.
Apple’s first ever foldable iPhone is currently expected to launch in fall 2026.
It will be a brand new addition to the flagship iPhone lineup, similar to how iPhone Air was this year’s entirely new model.
When the iPhone Fold (or iPhone Ultra, perhaps) arrives, Apple will surely be called “late” to the foldable smartphone market. Samsung, after all, launched its first foldable way back in 2019.
The iPhone Fold will debut a full seven years later. And yet, all signs indicate that Apple’s launch timing couldn’t be better.
Counterpoint Research recently published an overview of the foldable smartphone market, which is having perhaps its first true breakout year.
The US foldable smartphone market is expected to grow 68% YoY in 2025, as it enters a period of solid growth after several years of experimentation
That last word, “experimentation,” is a more positive way of saying that the market has struggled of late.
For the first several years of foldables’ availability, analysts expected significant growth, but consumers didn’t seem all that thrilled by what was being offered. Thus, foldables remained niche.
This year though, things are changing—and fresh momentum is almost certain to increase thanks to Apple’s upcoming entry.
Counterpoint’s report offers a great summary of current foldable momentum:
“The US foldable market is evolving from novelty to necessity,” said Liz Lee, Associate Director at Counterpoint Research. “While Samsung continues to lead in maturity and ecosystem strength in 2025, Motorola’s rapid expansion in the clamshell segment and Google’s AI-driven approach are reshaping competition. Apple’s eventual arrival in 2026 will not only expand the market but also cement foldables as a mainstream premium smartphone format.”
Why are foldables suddenly having a moment? General consensus is pretty simple: the products have finally gotten really good.
Samsung itself even hinted as much. When touting strong sales for its latest Galaxy Z Fold7, the company said: “Now on our seventh generation, we’ve addressed consumer feedback year after year and have arrived at the kind of experience you can’t get on any other device.”
All of this to say: when the iPhone Fold arrives next year, some might say Apple is late to the category, but the market seems to strongly indicate that it’s launching at just the right time.
Do you agree that Apple’s timing with iPhone Fold is just right, or should it have shipped a foldable sooner? Let us know in the comments.

Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) has found itself back on investors’ radar after a sharp post-earnings pullback brought the stock to a key technical support zone. Despite beating expectations and raising guidance, shares have slid nearly 30% this year as the market questions the pace of recovery across its core automation and enterprise mobility segments. Yet, technically, this is familiar territory for Zebra — and historically, levels like these have marked turning points for the stock.
The stock should be on your radar. Here’s why – it is presently trading within the support range ($260.59 – $288.03), levels from which it has previously enjoyed significant upward movement. Over the past 10 years, Zebra Technologies stock received buying interest at this level on 6 occasions and subsequently achieved an average peak return of 31.2%.
But is the price movement alone sufficient? It certainly helps if the fundamentals are sound. For ZBRA, check out Buy or Sell ZBRA Stock to evaluate how persuasive this buying opportunity could be.
The critical issue isn't just the direction of ZBRA stock, but how your portfolio is configured. Discover how Trefis High Quality Portfolio and Empirical Asset Management can assist you.
Here are some quick data points for Zebra Technologies that may assist in your decision-making:
For quick background, Zebra Technologies supplies enterprise asset intelligence solutions, including printers for labels and cards, as well as maintenance, support, repair, and professional services in asset tracking and enterprise mobility.
Zebra Technologies is not immune to severe downturns. It declined approximately 51% during the Dot-Com crash and experienced a 61% drop during the Global Financial Crisis. The 2018 correction caused a reduction of nearly 29%, while the Covid-related drop resulted in a loss of about 38%. The most significant impact was experienced during the recent inflation crisis, where it plummeted 68%. Strong fundamentals are important, but when markets turn adverse, even robust stocks like Zebra can suffer significant drops.
However, the risk isn't confined to significant market downturns. Stocks tend to decline even in favorable market conditions – consider scenarios such as earnings reports, business updates, or changes in outlook. Check ZBRA Dip Buyer Analyses to explore how the stock has rebounded from significant drops in the past.
The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has a history of consistently outperforming its benchmark which includes the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. What accounts for this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided better returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; they tend to be less volatile, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics."

On Wall Street, promotion season can be as nerve-racking as it is rewarding, and nowhere more so than at Goldman Sachs.
Goldman is set to kick off the process sometime in early November, marking the beginning of a wave of elevations that will sweep other banks from Citigroup to Morgan Stanley over the coming months. For a cohort of Goldman's vice presidents and executive directors, it's a time to find out if they'll be named managing directors, just one rung below the bank's all-powerful politburo of top execs, the partners.
In years past, roughly 600 people, about 1% of Goldman's workforce, have been promoted. It's always worth watching who the bank selects — not only does this constituency represent the hottest business lines and its next cohort of leaders, but it has also included literal stars like Justin Tuck, a 2021 designate who was a former New York Giants football champion.
Business Insider spoke with two knowledgeable former Goldman employees, a current GS banker, and a headhunter about expectations for this year's class and how the process unfolds behind the scenes. Those affiliated with the bank requested anonymity since they weren't authorized to discuss it with reporters.
Along with the prestige and bragging rights, being promoted to MD normally results in a pay bump. A person familiar with the matter said that managing directors earn a maximum of $400,000 a year in base salary; variable year-end compensation can push that number much higher.
Meridith Dennes, a veteran Wall Street recruiter, said the journey to being named an MD at Goldman can take more than a decade of hard work as candidates prove themselves across multiple market cycles.
The evaluation, she said, stretches over several months; feedback and deliberations ""can go right down to the wire.""
Inside Goldman, getting ahead comes down to a blend of strong performance and the right timing. Employees in any business line are eligible for the title, whether they work in investment banking, sales and trading, asset management, IT, or other areas.
""In a revenue-producing area, this individual may have earned the firm a lot of money. That's enough to get someone over the finish line,"" one former executive with direct knowledge of the promotion process said in an interview. Revenue-producing professionals would be front-facing rainmakers generating new deals for the investment bank, or portfolio managers winning over clients with hot new investment ideas.
""In a non-revenue-producing area,"" the person added, ""there usually has to be a story. What did this person do specifically to really help the firm? You need the top people to know that you've really made a contribution,"" the person added, pointing to the importance of division heads being aware of your achievements.
One current mid-senior banker at the firm told Business Insider that this year's promotions could highlight ""hot"" areas, such as AI banking, where Goldman advised on several major deals, and on sales and trading desks that carried the firm through volatile markets. The firm said revenues from its equities division topped $3.7 billion in the third quarter, up 23% year-to-date versus 2024.
""Investment banking always does well"" in promotion cycles, the person said, ""but sales and trading will do really well this year."" That prediction reflects broader market volatility that buoyed trading desks to unexpected heights starting around springtime.
The so-called cross-ruffing process (a nod to the card game bridge) is essential to both MD and partner promotions. It's a confidential review in which a coordinator reaches out to colleagues across the firm who have worked with a candidate. This coordinator, usually an MD promoted in an earlier class, seeks information about that person's performance and interactions with others.
The former executive said that a cross-ruffing leader is typically appointed for each group, someone senior who can operate with discretion. ""It's not meant to be visible at all to the managing director candidates,"" the person said.
The process picks up speed after the Labor Day holidays, the person added, but department bigwigs can shift the outcome at the last moment. ""Ultimately, it goes up to the senior people who run the group, and if they say no for whatever reason, then it's not going to happen,"" the ex-exec added.
Dennes agreed that the process stretches into the last moments. She added that it encompasses data from a candidate's entire career — not just a quarter or two of solid dealmaking. ""It's not a political play,"" she said.
For some, the promotion just won't be in the cards this year. And while that can sting, the former executive said the culture inside Goldman values composure, not the outward display of contempt if you're passed over.
""Some people are cross-ruffed, but it's just known that it's not quite their time yet,"" the former executive said.
So much of the process hinges on the coordinators' feedback and broader market factors that shape each class — including deal flow, hot sectors, and business demand — that it can be challenging to predict who will be in versus who will be out.
""It's really considered bad form to openly lobby for it,"" the person said. ""You're supposed to just be nonchalant and pretend that nothing's happening.""
For those who don't make the cut, they are often given an encouraging message, the executive added: ""You came really close this year. We just had some people ahead of you. Keep doing what you're doing, and you're going to get it next time around.""

33,2025-10-29,"Apple is rolling out a round of enhancements that will make it easier for developers to submit, manage, and market their apps on the App Store. Here’s what’s new.
As detailed in the News section of Apple’s Developer website, developers can now:
Here are a few details on each update:
Apple says that now, even if a developer already has an app version under review, they can submit additional items to App Review independently.
This includes one or more In-App Events, one or more Game Center features (such as achievements, leaderboards, and challenges), or even a critical bug-fix update.
Here’s Apple’s full description of what’s new in submitting additional items to App Review:
Now you can send additional items to App Review independent of an existing submission, giving you greater flexibility when submitting your apps and games. For example, you can now submit:
Apple says that developers can now publish “up to 70 custom pages at a given time,” which in practice means developers will get to enjoy more flexibility to “highlight different content and features within your app or game using unique screenshots, app previews, and promotional text”.
Additionally, Apple announced today that developers can now “assign keywords to each custom product page” to improve App Store discoverability, as “custom product pages with keywords assigned to them can appear in search results for those selected keywords instead of your default product page.”
Apple also announced that it will expand offer codes to:
In practice, this means that offer codes now support every type of In-App Purchase, marking the first step in Apple’s transition away from promo codes, also announced today:
“Offer codes build on the functionality of promo codes and provide improved configuration and customer eligibility options. As a result, starting March 26, 2026, you’ll no longer be able to create promo codes for In-App Purchases in App Store Connect. Any existing promo codes for In-App Purchases you’ve created can be redeemed until they expire. You can continue to use promo codes in order to provide people with a free download of your app.”

By Reuters

Nvidia has become the first company to reach $5 trillion in market value amid a global artificial intelligence arms race.
The chipmaker surge on Wednesday came only three months after the company topped the $4 trillion mark.
The milestone underscores the company’s swift transformation from a niche graphics-chip designer into the backbone of the global AI industry, turning CEO Jensen Huang into a Silicon Valley icon and making its advanced chips a flashpoint in the tech rivalry between the US and China.
Since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022, Nvidia’s shares have climbed 12-fold as the AI frenzy propelled the S&P 500 to record highs, igniting a debate on whether frothy tech valuations could lead to the next big bubble.
The new milestone would surpass the total cryptocurrency market value and equal roughly half the size of Europe’s benchmark equities index, the Stoxx 600 index .
“Nvidia hitting a $5 trillion market cap is more than a milestone; it’s a statement, as Nvidia has gone from chip maker to industry creator,” said Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, which holds shares in the company.
“The market continues to underestimate the scale of the opportunity, and Nvidia remains one of the best ways to play the AI theme.”
Huang unveiled $500bn in AI chip orders on Tuesday and said he plans to build seven supercomputers for the US government.
Meanwhile, President Donald Trump is expected to discuss Nvidia’s Blackwell chip with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday. Sales of the high-end chip have been a key sticking point between the two sides due to Washington’s export controls.
At current prices, CEO Huang’s stake in Nvidia would be worth about $179.2bn, according to regulatory filings and Reuters calculations. He is the world’s eighth-richest person, as per Forbes’ billionaire list.
Born in Taiwan and raised in the US from age nine, Huang has led Nvidia since founding it in 1993. Under his leadership, the company’s H100 and Blackwell processors have become the engines behind large-language models powering tools such as ChatGPT and Elon Musk’s xAI.
 

 
While Nvidia remains the clear front-runner in the AI race, Big Tech peers such as Apple and Microsoft have also crossed $4 trillion in market value in recent months.
Analysts say the rally reflects investor confidence in unrelenting AI spending, though some warn valuations may be running hot.
“AI’s current expansion relies on a few dominant players financing each other’s capacity. The moment investors start demanding cash-flow returns instead of capacity announcements, some of these flywheels could seize,” said Matthew Tuttle, CEO of Tuttle Capital Management.
Nvidia is due to report quarterly results on November 19.
The company’s dominance has drawn global regulatory scrutiny, with US export curbs on advanced chips making it a key pawn in Washington’s strategy to limit China’s access to AI technology.
“Nvidia clearly brought their story to DC to both educate and gain favour with the US government,” said Bob O’Donnell of TECHnalysis Research. “They managed to hit most of the hottest and most influential topics in tech.”
The developer conference on Tuesday also served as a platform for Huang to walk a geopolitical tightrope.
He praised Trump’s “America First” policies for accelerating domestic tech investment, while warning that excluding China from Nvidia’s ecosystem could limit US access to half of the world’s AI developers.
Rivals, including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and several well-funded startups, are seeking to challenge Nvidia’s dominance in high-end AI chips, but it remains the industry’s top choice.
On Wall Street, Nvidia’s stock is surging. As of 10:45am in New York (14:45 GMT) the stock is up 5.1 percent from the market open.

Nvidia’s first ever GTC to be hosted in Washington D.C.âa conference that’s been deemed the “Super Bowl of AI”âwas a rare occasion that brought together both government officials and the tech industry under one roof.
It was an opportunity for the tech executives in attendance to advocate for industry friendly policies straight to the government. Unsurprisingly, CEO Jensen Huang was first to take advantage of that opportunity to the fullest.
“America needs to be the most aggressive in adopting AI technology of any country in the world, bar none, and that is an imperative. We can’t regulate our way out of this, we can’t fear-monger our way out of this,” Huang said in a press and industry briefing. “We have to encourage every single company, every single student, to use AI.”
The leather jacket-clad executive spent most of his crowd-facing time repeating Trump administration talking points on bringing back manufacturing or lauding the President. He also spent time trying to make the case for the normalization of trade ties with China.
“As it turns out, the best benefit to United States is for American technology to be available in China to win the hearts and minds of their developers,” Huang said. “A policy that causes America to lose half of the world’s AI developers is not beneficial long term, it hurts us more. It hurts America more than it hurts them.”
Huang also argued that because China is a huge creator of open source software, if Americans retreat completely from China they might risk being “ill-prepared” for when Chinese software “permeates the world.”
The U.S.-China trade war has impacted so many parts of the global economy, but the tech industry has been at the forefront, with Nvidia right in the bullseye.
The Biden administration was first to enforce export restrictions on Nvidia’s chips sales to China, due to national security concerns and competitive fears. The restrictions got even stricter under Trump after Beijing landed a big blow to American AI confidence earlier this year with DeepSeek’s R1, a model that rivaled some of the best American AI offerings despite using lower cost chips. It showed the U.S. that Chinese developers did not need access to the highest tech Nvidia chips to make models that outperform expectations.
The few months of the Trump imposed blanket exports ban was a big hit to Nvidia: executives shared in a May earnings call that they were revising revenue expectations for the quarter down by about $8 billion because of it.
After a months-long noteworthy lobbying effort by Huang, Trump decided to relax the rule in July, but then demanded a 15% cut from China sales in return.
Now, Huang reveals there’s not yet a signed document for that arrangement.
“The administration is working on that, and until then, we don’t really have to confront it, because, you know, obviously China hasn’t decided to allow our chips to go back to China,” Huang said.
After Trump okayed the sale of Nvidia’s chips to China, it was now Beijing’s turn to take a hard stance on the chipmaker.
Chinese authorities have started discouraging local industry titans from purchasing Nvidia chips.
The reason for that could be because Beijing has decided to decouple its AI industry from American tech.
Chinese AI industry is currently dependent on American chipmakers like Nvidia, and that gives Americans an edge, especially when the only chips they allow in are lower-model ones. In the absence of Nvidia chips, China will have to develop their own high-tech chips that can rival, and perhaps even surpass, the quality of Nvidia chips. If that happens, the United States can be at jeopardy to lose its hold on the global chips market to China.
After Trumpâs blanket ban earlier this year choked off flow of Nvidia chips, Chinese chip development ramped up. China chip stocks are now experiencing a major boom, so big that Cambricon had to warn investors recently that things might be getting a little too hot.
In its latest earnings call, Nvidia executives conceded that they were facing disappointing numbers from the region still because H20 chip shipments were yet to begin. Now, Huang is working hard to turn those numbers back up.
Huang took to the stage at the press briefing with secretary of energy Chris Wright, in light of the tech giant’s announcement that it would be building seven giant AI supercomputers for the Department of Energy. Wright shared that he is optimistic that the two global superpowers would soon have a trade agreement.
“China is an economic, scientific powerhouse, so we have some differences across the nations, but we have a lot of common ground,” Wright said.
Trump is currently in South Korea, where he is scheduled to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in a couple of hours. Huang said on Tuesday that he was flying out very soon to meet the President in South Korea, and he was notably missing from GTC on Wednesday.
While Huang refused to answer questions on whether or not he would be joining the meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping, he did say that he had “a lot of announcements to make there.”
While aboard Air Force One to South Korea, Trump told reporters that he might talk about the sale of Nvidia’s Blackwell model chips to China in his meeting with the President. He called the chips “super-duper.”

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has faced challenges in the past. Its stock has experienced declines of more than 30% within less than 2 months on 14 occasions across multiple years, erasing billions in market value, and wiping out substantial gains in a single correction. If historical trends are any indication, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock is not protected from abrupt and significant downturns.
The Risk That Is Brewing
Stocks can experience volatility, but the markets are not immune either – as seen in 2008 and 2020. Volatility is a reality. Discover how Empirical Asset Management‘s allocation framework addressed both scenarios.
 
Is Risk Showing Up In Financials Yet?
Assessing the fundamentals can certainly help alleviate risks. For more insights on AMD, read Buy or Sell AMD Stock. Below are some key figures that are significant.
How Bad Can It Really Get?
When evaluating AMD’s risks in challenging markets, the data tells a compelling story. The stock fell by over 83% during the Dot-Com crash and nearly 92% during the Global Financial Crisis. The inflation spike in 2022 also significantly impacted it, resulting in a decline of approximately 65%. Smaller downturns like those in 2018 and during COVID-19 also triggered drops of around 49% and 34%, respectively. Thus, despite the positive factors surrounding AMD, major market selloffs have had a dramatic impact.
However, the risk is not confined to significant market crashes. Stocks can decline even in favorable market conditions – consider events like earnings announcements, business updates, and changes in outlook. Read AMD Dip Buyer Analyses to understand how the stock has bounced back from steep declines in the past.

37,2025-10-29,"Withings' U-Scan, the company's toilet-mounted health sensor first unveiled at CES 2023, is now available in both the U.S. and Europe after a two-year delay. The compact device analyzes urine samples automatically, part of Withings' latest effort to bring passive health tracking into everyday routines.
The commercial version launches with two interchangeable testing cartridges: Nutrio and Calci. Nutrio monitors nutrition and hydration indicators including ketones, vitamin C, pH, and hydration levels, while Calci tracks calcium levels that can contribute to kidney stone formation. Each cartridge provides approximately 22 tests over three months and can be swapped through the Withings Health Mate app.
U-Scan is sold in two packages. The Proactive package costs $349.95 and includes the reader, charging station, and one cartridge. The Intensive package runs $429.95 and includes two cartridges for 44 total tests. Replacement cartridges are priced at $99.95 each or $179.95 per pair, and can be automatically delivered regularly via a Withings Plus subscription.
One notable change since the original announcement is how Withings is positioning the product. The company now classifies U-Scan as a ""wellness product"" rather than pursuing FDA clearance, which allows it to bypass lengthy regulatory approval. The classification basically focuses the device on general health and lifestyle tracking rather than diagnostic use.
The Cycle Sync cartridge, which was originally promised for menstrual and ovulation tracking, remains delayed. Withings says it plans to bring that cartridge to market at a later date. 
The U-Scan follows the recent launch of Kohler's Dekoda, an iPhone-connected gut health and hydration monitor that's designed to be attached to a toilet rim where it uses sensors to analyze your poop rather than your pee. With the launch of Withings' device, now you can do both.

First United Corp (FUNC: $36/share) has grown revenue and net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) by 7% and 18% compounded annually since 2014, respectively. First United’s NOPAT margin increased from 8% in 2014 to 23% in the trailing-twelve months (TTM), while its invested capital turns rose from 0.4 to 0.5 over the same time. Rising NOPAT margins and invested capital turns drive First United’s return on invested capital (ROIC) from 4% in 2014 to 12% in the TTM.
Figure 1: First United’s Revenue and NOPAT Since 2014
At its current price of $36/share, FUNC has a price-to-economic book value (PEBV) ratio of 0.6. This ratio means the market expects First United’s NOPAT to permanently decline by 40% from TTM levels. This expectation seems overly pessimistic for a company that has grown NOPAT by 10% compounded annually over the last five years and 18% compounded annually over the last ten years.
Even if First United’s NOPAT margin falls to 14% (compared to 23% in the TTM) and the company grows revenue by 3% (below ten-year CAGR of 7%) compounded annually through 2034, the stock would be worth $47/share today – a 31% upside. In this scenario, First United’s NOPAT would fall <1% compounded annually through 2034. 
Should First United grow profits more in line with historical levels, the stock has even more upside.
Below are specifics on the adjustments I made based on Robo-Analyst findings in First United’s 10-K and 10-Q:
Income Statement: I made nearly $10 million in adjustments, with a net effect of removing under $5 million in non-operating expense. 
Balance Sheet: I made just under $90 million in adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net increase of over $40 million. One of the most notable adjustments was for other comprehensive income. 
Valuation: I made just under $20 million in adjustments to shareholder value, with a net increase of under $5 million. The most notable adjustment was for overfunded pensions. "

GRAB stock (NASDAQ: GRAB) stock has grown 24% year to date, fueled by growing optimism around its improving profitability, expanding fintech business, and the broader rebound in Southeast Asia’s ride-hailing and delivery demand. Investor sentiment has also been supported by the company’s progress in cutting costs and accelerating revenue growth through higher user engagement and cross-platform services.
However, we believe it may be an opportune time to trim exposure to GRAB stock. While the company’s Moderate operational execution and improving financial discipline are commendable, the Very High valuation and competitive risks make the stock Unattractive at current levels.
Key concerns linger. Competition remains fierce across both the mobility and delivery segments, with regional rivals such as Gojek and Foodpanda maintaining aggressive pricing and promotional strategies. Meanwhile, growth in Grab’s fintech arm faces regulatory and credit-quality headwinds, potentially tempering margin expansion. Although the path to sustained profitability appears clearer, the stock’s sharp run-up already prices in much of the near-term optimism.
Below is our evaluation:
GRAB stock has the potential to fluctuate. A well-rounded allocation, less so. Empirical Asset Management combines strategy and discipline to mitigate market volatility.
Let’s delve into the details of each of the assessed factors, but first, for a brief background: With $24 Bill in market cap, Grab Holdings offers transportation, delivery, mobile payment, and financial services throughout Southeast Asia through an integrated fintech and mobility platform.
[1] Valuation Appears Very High
This table illustrates how GRAB's valuation compares to the wider market. For additional information see: GRAB Valuation Ratios
[2] Growth Is Very Strong
This table illustrates how GRAB's growth compares to the larger market.
[3] Profitability Seems Weak
This table shows how GRAB's profitability compares to the wider market.
[4] Financial Stability Feels Very Strong
[5] Downturn Resilience Is Moderate
GRAB experienced an effect slightly better than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. This assessment is based on both (a) the extent of the stock's decline and, (b) the rapidity of its recovery.
2022 Inflation Shock
2020 Covid Pandemic

Netflix stock (NASDAQ:NFLX) has shown remarkable performance, increasing by 45% in the last 12 months and currently trades at approximately $1,100 for each share. This surge has been fueled by the company's efforts to tackle password sharing and the introduction of its advertising-supported streaming option, although the stock has experienced a minor sell-off in recent times. After reaching a peak of roughly $1,340 in June, it has declined due to Q3 earnings that fell short of expectations, resulting in Netflix revenues and margins coming in below projections. Despite the recent drop, the stock still trades at around 45 times the forecasted earnings.
We think the stock faces significant downside risk at such high levels. With increasing macroeconomic uncertainties and indications that subscriber growth may decelerate, investors might be overlooking possible risks. In our opinion, the stock could decline drastically — potentially falling below $500 per share. A 50% correction may seem drastic, but it would not be without precedent. This has occurred before and could likely happen again. However, any potential correction would not necessarily arise from a breakdown in Netflix’s fundamentals, but rather from a recalibration of its valuation multiple as growth begins to stabilize.
Investing in single stocks can be risky, yet there is significant value in utilizing a broader, diversified strategy. If you're looking for some upside with reduced volatility compared to holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio (HQ) — HQ has outperformed its benchmark, a blend of S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap indices, achieving returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Effective risk management is essential — consider what long-term portfolio performance might look like if you incorporated 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto alongside HQ's performance metrics.
Netflix's subscriber growth could eventually decelerate as significant measures like the crackdown on password sharing and ad-supported plans have typically been implemented across major markets. These initiatives were substantial strategic changes aimed at creating new revenue streams and enlarging the user base after growth stagnated following the pandemic. However, demand may have been pulled forward that might have otherwise emerged over the next few years, leading to softer subscriber additions in the future. The company’s intent to cease reporting subscriber figures from 2025 might also reflect internal expectations for slower growth ahead.
In 2024 alone, Netflix added over 40 million subscribers, bringing its paid user count to nearly 302 million by the end of the year, marking a record annual increase that considerably propelled the stock’s upward trajectory. Growth was mainly stimulated by the crackdown on password sharing, which incentivized users to either purchase extra member access or create new accounts. Simultaneously, the ad-supported tier gained substantial traction, with Netflix reporting last quarter that it had over 94 million ad-supported users. While Netflix is becoming more efficient in monetizing its ads, subscriber growth has been a fundamental driver of the company’s expansion. With these significant growth levers now mostly exhausted, Netflix may find it challenging to maintain its present momentum, which could have repercussions on the stock’s performance.
Economic uncertainty and rising costs could also pressure Netflix, which heavily relies on consumer spending. The introduction of tariffs on essential trading partners is already causing inflation in the U.S. to rise. This may decrease disposable income and, in turn, potentially weaken consumer spending. This situation could be detrimental for Netflix, which depends on discretionary income. Additionally, Netflix’s plans have become pricier, with its premium plan now priced at $25 a month and the standard HD plan recently increasing by $2.50 to $18 per month. This may result in a slowdown in new sign-ups.
At the same time, Netflix’s content expenses are set to increase as it delves deeper into live sports programming, such as NFL games and WWE wrestling, which typically incur higher production and licensing costs. Although the recent decline in Q3 operating margin to 28% — against a predicted 31.5% — largely resulted from an unforeseen tax dispute in Brazil, margins may remain susceptible as spending pressures accumulate. For the entirety of 2025, Netflix now anticipates an operating margin of 29%, slightly down from its earlier forecast of 30%.
NFLX stock has experienced slightly better performance compared to the benchmark S&P 500 index during some recent market downturns. Concerned about the effect of a market crash on NFLX stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go In A Market Crash presents a detailed analysis of how S&P stocks performed during and after prior market crashes.

But the risk isn’t confined to major market crashes. Stocks can decline even in favorable market conditions — consider events like earnings reports, company updates, or outlook modifications. Check out NFLX Dip Buyer Analyses to see how the stock has recovered from significant dips in the past.
At the current share price of $1,100, Netflix trades at approximately 45 times consensus earnings for 2025 and around 34 times the consensus earnings for 2026, which is high compared to historical standards. In contrast, the stock was trading at approximately 20 times earnings in mid-2022. Although Netflix’s recent financial results have been robust, markets can be short-sighted, projecting short-term successes into the distant future. In Netflix’s situation, the prevailing assumption is that the company will sustain its strong sequence of subscriber acquisitions and likely grow revenues comfortably in double digits.
Nevertheless, there’s a real chance that Netflix will soon witness a slowdown in growth, as the combined advantages of the password-sharing crackdown and ad-supported tiers eventually stabilize, all while economic uncertainties continue to rise in the U.S. Essentially, the downside risk here lies less in Netflix’s business viability and more in the extent to which investors are prepared to pay for its next phase of slower, more mature growth.
Worried about Netflix stock's high valuation? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a selection of 30 stocks, has a history of consistently outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why is this the case? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks offered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; less volatility, as indicated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics."

Alphabet, Google's parent company, had a record-breaking Q3 this year as the company reported its ""first-ever $100 billion quarter."" The company's Q3 earnings report revealed a 16% year-over-year revenue increase, reaching a total of $102.3 billion.
This significant growth in revenue was driven by all of Alphabet's segments, including YouTube Ads, Google Search, and the Platforms and Devices department. ""We had a terrific quarter, with double-digit growth across every major part of our business,"" said Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet and Google.
Furthermore, the report indicated that the company's operating income was $31.2 billion, which is a 9% YoY increase when compared to the same time in 2024. This figure includes the $3.5 billion European Commission fine.
 



Google Search, YouTube ads saw a 15% year-over-year increase, with the revenue totaling $56.57 billion ($49.3 billion in 2024) and $10.26 billion ($8.92 billion).""In a world where AI-driven search volumes are steadily taking market share and reshaping Alphabet’s legacy business, this report makes it clear the company isn’t ready to give up its lead anytime soon,"" said Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com. in an email to Android Central.
 



The Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices segment, which includes Google One, YouTube Premium, and hardware sales, saw the fastest growth at approximately 21% year-over-year, bringing in $12.87 billion.
Speaking of AI, Pichai also noted that their AI-first strategy is pushing them in the right direction. ""We’re shipping at speed, including the global rollout of AI Overviews and AI Mode in Search in record time."" Additionally, he stated that Gemini App has over 650 million monthly active users, contributing to significant growth in new business ventures.
Alphabet will likely see the same revenue momentum in the fourth quarter as well, according to Anat Ashkenazi, chief financial officer of Alphabet and Google. During the earnings call, she noted that ""Current exchange rates suggest a positive impact from foreign currency on Q4 revenues.""

Alphabet's overall expenditure is expected to increase between $91 billion to 93 billion by the end of 2025, which is up from its previous estimate of $85 billion. ""We're continuing to invest aggressively due to the demand we're experiencing from Cloud customers, as well as the growth opportunities we see across the company,"" Ashkenazi added.
Lastly, when asked about the advancements to Gemini, Pichai confirmed that Gemini 3.0, its new model, is expected to be released ""later this year."" He noted that he is incredibly impressed by the pace at which the teams are working to improve these AI models.

Joby Aviation stock (NASDAQ: JOBY) has seen a significant decline, dropping 20.2% in less than a month, from $19.57 on October 6, 2025, to the current price of $15.61.This sharp correction was triggered by a specific event: In early October, Joby announced an underwritten public offering of 30.5 million shares at $16.85 per share. This offering price represented a significant discount to the stock’s preceding market value. Crucially, the move immediately increased the total number of available shares, raising investor concerns over the dilution of existing shares and directly causing the price to drop. 
Given the current correction and our ""Very Unattractive"" view of the stock, we anticipate further declines ahead. A target price of $12 is a realistic possibility, especially considering the stock has traded at this level within the last five years. The present price action indicates potential for additional downside until this lower floor is tested.
So should you hold off on purchasing during this dip? Maybe. Timing dips perfectly is challenging. Nonetheless, here is another viewpoint on JOBY stock to assist with your decision-making. The stock has historically returned a median of -16% over the past year, and 43% as the peak return following sharp dips (>30% in 30 days). For some background, JOBY is engaged in aerial ridesharing services by developing electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft designed for urban transport.
For insights on stock fundamentals and evaluation: View Buy or Sell Joby Aviation Stock for a comprehensive overview.
That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like JOBY, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
JOBY has experienced 7 incidents since 1/1/2010, where a dip threshold of -30% within 30 days was reached
To minimize the risk of a dip indicating an ongoing decline in business health, revenue growth, profitability, cash flow, and balance sheet strength need to be closely examined.
While dip buying can be appealing, it is crucial to assess it thoughtfully from various perspectives. This multi-faceted analysis is precisely the approach we implement in constructing the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics."

If you want a thin Android phone, your best bet right now is the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge. For some days, it has been at a record-low price of $689.99. We thought it was a good idea to remind you of this offer again, as it seems stock is running out! Keep reading to learn more.
Buy the Sasmung Galaxy S25 Edge for just $689.99 ($410 off)
This offer is available from Amazon. While the discount applied to all color versions, Amazon now only has the Titanium Silver version in stock. You can get the other colors from third-party sellers for more.
The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is at a record-low price, and it seems the deal is working. This is because the Titanium Jetblack and Titanium Icyblue are out of stock on Amazon. Only the Titanium silver model is available directly from Amazon; we’re not sure how long it will last. You might want to act quickly if you’re looking to catch this deal!
While many don’t see the value in it, I happen to be a big fan of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge. Sure, you can get better phones, but in a world where high-end phones are very similar, I happen to prioritize form over function. This phone is among the thinnest at just 5.8mm! The only mainstream competitor is the Apple iPhone Air, really.
This phone isn’t just thin; it is also quite an outstanding device. Let’s expand on the design. It is super thin, but it is also quite resistant. You’re getting a sturdy titanium frame, which is usually something we see in the best of the best phones. It also sports Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 in the front and Gorilla Glass Victus 2 in the back. You won’t have to worry about liquids or dust damaging it, either, as it gets an IP68 rating.

Are there any sacrifices that come with making such a thin phone? Definitely! The main one is that you can’t fit a large battery in such a reduced space. This one has a 3,900mAh battery. Also, while the camera system is good, it’s not as impressive as what you’ll find in the main Galaxy S25 series.
All things considered, though, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is a premium handset. The super-thin design is really just the cherry on top. And at only $689.99, it’s also a great deal. Just make sure to act quickly if you want to take advantage of this sale. Again, other colors have sold out already. We’re thinking it might be a matter of time before the Titanium Silver model is gone, too.
If you can spare a bit of extra cash, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge with 512GB is also at a really nice price! It’s $729.99. That is a $490 discount, and only $40 more than the 256GB model. Similarly, this one is also available from Amazon only in one color: Titanium Jetblack. This means it may also be gone soon!

On Tuesday, a collective shudder ran down the spine of America's white-collar workforce. Amazon announced it's laying off 14,000 employees in a memo that cited AI, kicking off a plan that is expected eventually to affect as many as 30,000 corporate jobs.
CEO Andy Jassy had hinted this was coming back in June, when he said that AI's capabilities would allow Amazon to shrink its white-collar workforce in the future. But he'd framed that future as ""the next few years."" I figured Amazon would get there the same way it had already been: by hiring very little and quietly cutting a few teams here and there.
Apparently, Amazon is done waiting. It's shifted its AI workforce strategy from slow attrition to full throttle. And with that, it's ushering in a new era of post-ChatGPT corporate America: the age of mass AI layoffs.
Why the sudden leap? One obvious factor that went unmentioned in the announcement is Amazon's position in the ever-heightening winner-takes-all AI race. It's scrambling to keep up with Microsoft and Google's cloud businesses, which are growing faster than its own. In its push to hire more AI experts and build more data centers, the company needs to free up a lot of cash, fast. Executives don't think they have the luxury to wait a few years to do that slowly.
Amazon's official rationale is that AI is ""enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before."" Because of that, an HR executive explained, the company needs to be ""organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible."" That sounds a little different from ""AI's taking 10% of our jobs,"" but I think it's effectively the same thing. Even though tech has long mythologized the benefits of lean teams, large businesses still needed armies of people to keep everything running; deep cuts risked stretching the remaining staff too thin. With AI's growing capabilities, executives don't seem worried about that anymore.
More companies are sure to follow Amazon. For an industry that prides itself on innovation, tech companies love to copy each other: All it took was Meta announcing some 11,000 job cuts in late 2022 to trigger a wave of mass layoffs across Silicon Valley that swept up more than a quarter million people in 2023 and spread to the rest of corporate America (those cuts were attributed to overhiring in the pandemic, not AI). Amazon's move this week gives CEOs the social cover to make their own aggressive cuts even as they sit on tens of billions of dollars in cash. And whether CEOs actually want to make such deep cuts, investors will be pushing for them — especially if Amazon's decision helps it gain ground in the AI race.
When I first started reporting on ChatGPT's impact on the labor market in 2023, I thought it would take a decade for AI to meaningfully reshape the corporate workforce. Historically, workers have been slow to adopt new tools — and companies even slower to reorganize and capitalize on the productivity gains. So I was stunned when, earlier this year, I started seeing signs that companies were hiring fewer people because of AI. In the spring, tech employers including Shopify and Duolingo told their teams they wouldn't get headcount for roles AI might be able to do. Shortly after, an analysis I reported on showed that hiring had slowed most sharply in roles that are highly exposed to AI.
Still, there's a big difference between slower hiring and laying off an entire city's worth of workers in a day. I'd assumed companies would stick with their gradual trimming-by-attrition approach, which is less disruptive to their operations — especially while employers are still trying to figure out AI's actual capabilities. ""For simple record-keeping tasks, AI can already perform as well as humans,"" says Daron Acemoglu, a Nobel Prize-winning economist at MIT and a leading expert on technological change. ""But beyond that, we still need more advances for AI to be able to deal with edge cases which are important for many office workers."" So even a few weeks ago, I would have said we're still many years away from big AI-driven cuts. I wouldn't say that anymore.
The speed of this change should alarm us all. When automation comes slowly, we have time to adapt. Workers can reassess their soon-to-be-obsolete careers and learn new skills. Schools can adjust their curricula. Voters can debate, organize, and push for guardrails that their elected officials can then enact. In that earlier era of trimming-by-attrition circa last week, we still had precious time to make the transition into the AI future a little more orderly and a little less painful.
But what we're seeing now from Amazon is pure chaos. Some 30,000 of its employees (Reuters reports) will soon be competing for an already-shrunken pool of white-collar jobs — and they'll be in a market that's only going to get more crowded with unemployed professionals as other businesses adopt the Amazon playbook. Will these workers find comparable roles, or will they have to start over in new careers? Will they keep their salaries, or take steep pay cuts that hobble their earning potential for years to come? These are just the first of the difficult questions Amazon's displaced workers face today — and many more of us will face in the months and years ahead.

Audiophiles, rejoice: the Black Friday deals are finally starting to trickle in, but you may not need to wait to score an excellent discount on premium noise-cancelling headphones. Weeks ahead of the big sale weekend, Amazon is carving 26% off the elegant Bowers & Wilkins PX8 headphones, knocking the price down to $519.59 for a limited time. 
Bowers & Wilkins is widely-known for producing stylish, comfortable wireless headphones that please audiophiles and casual listeners alike, whether you're immersing yourself in classical music, metal, or an action-packed video game. 
At $699, however, the PX8 might be a bit too expensive for some folks. Thankfully, this early Black Friday deal is making the headphones much more accessible. Will the price drop further as we approach Black Friday and Cyber Monday? It's very possible, but this deal is worthy enough on its own if you don't want to wait until next month. 
Bowers & Wilkins PX8: $699 $519.59 at Amazon
The Bowers & Wilkins PX8 are among the best noise-cancelling headphones we've ever used, but they're far from cheap. Fortunately, Amazon has launched an early Black Friday deal that slashes 26% off the price of the luxurious cans, making them much more accessible for music lovers all over. 
✅Recommended if: you want superbly detailed and balanced sound quality with excellent noise cancellation in a sleek, elegant package; you need headphones with great battery life. 
❌Skip this deal if: you enjoy having lots of customization options and EQ settings with your headphones; you follow a vegan or plant-based lifestyle (the PX8 use leather in their construction).
The Bowers & Wilkins PX8 are stunning headphones inside and out, with outstanding ANC (active noise cancellation) capabilities, a versatile sound signature, and up to 30 hours of battery life on a single charge. With a Nappa leather and aluminum construction, the PX8 also look and feel like the height of luxury, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with other premium headphone brands like Bang & Olufsen. 
Another standout feature is the headphones' USB-C port for audio, which lets you charge and listen to your favorite tunes without Bluetooth. The cans also come with a 3.5mm cable in the box. 
 



One thing that holds the Bowers & Wilkins PX8 back is the customization. Unlike the best headphones from Bose and Sony, the PX8 don't offer a ton of customization options in the companion app, which means you're limited to basic bass and treble control. The noise-cancellation also isn't very adjustable, which is a problem at this price point.
Fortunately, the headphones come with some pretty versatile default settings and excellent ANC support with passthrough, so it shouldn't be too much of an issue for most folks. That said, if you're an audiophile who likes to finetune your EQ settings, you may wish to look at other premium headphones, such as the Sony WH-1000XM6. 
Needless to say, if you value great performance and sophistication in your devices, this headphones deal is a dream opportunity, no matter what you're listening to. Amazon is saying that stock is low, however, so I'd act fast if you're interested: miss this deal and you'll have to wait until Black Friday to score sweet savings.

Milwaukee-based financial company Fiserv’s stock collapsed more than 40% after cutting its earnings outlook and disclosing a sharp slowdown in its payment business, deepening investor concern amid an ongoing lawsuit over alleged inflated growth claims tied to its Clover platform.
Fiserv stock plunged 43.9% Wednesday, largely in a morning selloff, after the company cut its full-year outlook and CEO Mike Lyons acknowledged the firm is underperforming.
The company reported just 1% organic revenue growth in the third quarter, down sharply from 8% in the second quarter, and well below the double-digit gains seen earlier this year.
Growth in the Merchant Solutions segment, home to Fiserv’s Clover payments system, slowed to 5%, roughly half the pace of the previous quarter.
Clover helps small businesses take payments from credit cards, debit cards and mobile wallets, using various types of hardware devices.
Fiserv now expects 3.5% to 4% organic revenue growth for the full year, down from 10% in the second quarter.
The company also lowered its adjusted earnings forecast to $8.50-$8.60 per share for the third quarter of 2025, down from $10.15-$10.30 in the previous quarter.
$30 billion. That’s how much the selloff wiped out more than in market cap for the company, dropping from $68.6 billion Tuesday to $38.4 billion as of Wednesday's market close.
“Our current performance is not where we want it to be nor where our stakeholders expect it to be,” Lyons said.
Fiserv faces a federal securities class-action lawsuit in the Southern District of New York that accuses the company of inflating growth figures for its Clover payments platform. The complaint alleges Fiserv forced merchants on its older and more affordable Payeezy system to move to Clover while claiming that growth came from new customers. Those migrations allegedly artificially boosted short-term revenue and transaction volumes forecasts which in turn hid slowing organic expansion. When many merchants decided to switch to lower-cost rivals such as Square and Toast, Clover’s performance faltered. According to the lawsuit, former CEO Frank Bisignano told investors in 2023 that 90% of Clover’s revenue growth would come from new merchants and just 10% from existing clients, even as the company moved roughly 200,000 Payeezy merchants to Clover through mid-2024. That shift helped lift Clover’s 2024 revenue to $2.7 billion on $310 billion in gross payment volume, but by early 2025, gross payment volume growth slowed to 8%, down from 14%-17% the year before. The slowdown deepened by July 2025 as Fiserv lowered its growth forecast for payments it receives from merchants from 11% to 9%, prompting analysts at Wolfe Research and Keefe Bruyette & Woods to question management's credibility. 
Fiserv also announced an executive leadership and board overhaul, naming Takis Georgakopulous and Dhivya Suryadevera as co-presidents and Paul Todd as chief financial officer.

Marvell Technology (MRVL) stock warrants your attention. Why? Because you receive high cash flow margins at a discounted price. Here are some details.
While revenue growth is beneficial, this is not purely a growth viewpoint. Pricing power along with high margins leads to steady and foreseeable profits and cash flows, which mitigates risk and permits capital reinvestment. The market tends to favor that.
While Marvell stock has been weighed down by lumpy orders and customers-end delays for chips, there are signs that the company could be building a niche for itself in AI infrastructure. AI landscape could move from heavy, centralized model training to continuous inference, which is essentially running the models, across millions of devices and applications. This change favors Marvell’s expertise in designing specialized, power-efficient chips compared to the high-end GPUs used for training. 
For some background, Marvell Technology develops analog, mixed-signal, and digital integrated circuits, as well as Ethernet solutions and storage controllers for both hard drives and solid-state drives that support various host system interfaces.
However, do these figures tell the entire story? Read Buy or Sell MRVL Stock to determine if Marvell Technology retains a competitive advantage upon further scrutiny.

Stocks Like These Can Outperform. Here Is Data
We select stocks that exceed $10 Billion in market capitalization and filter based on high CFO (cash flow from operations) margins or operating margins. We also focus on those stocks that have substantially decreased in value over the previous year.
Below are the statistics for stocks with this selection strategy applied since 12/31/2016.
But Consider The Risk
While Marvell may seem strong, it is not immune to crashes. It dropped 92% during the Dot-Com bubble and nearly 77% throughout the Global Financial Crisis. The 2022 inflation surge affected it by about 62%. Even smaller declines — the 2018 correction and the Covid pandemic — saw it drop close to 40%. Certainly, it shows strong fundamentals, but when the market shifts, steep declines are part of the process.
Nevertheless, the risk is not confined to major market downturns. Stocks can decline even during favorable market conditions — consider events like earnings announcements, business updates, or changes in outlook. Read MRVL Dip Buyer Analyses to learn how the stock has bounced back from significant dips in the past.
The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising a collection of 30 stocks, has consistently outperformed its benchmark, which includes all three indices — the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. Why is that? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have offered better returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; presenting a smoother investment experience, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Royal Gold (NASDAQ: RGLD) stock may be a promising choice to capitalize on the momentum. Why? Because it offers strong margins, a low-debt capital structure, and strong momentum. Here are some key figures.
While revenue growth is beneficial, this selection is centered around harnessing momentum with quality – evaluated through margins (indicating pricing power / robust business model) and capital structure (not overly reliant on debt).
For some context, Royal Gold manages precious metal streams and royalties, overseeing interests in 187 global properties spanning five continents, including the U.S., Canada, Chile, Australia, Africa, and Mexico. Royal Gold stock tends to move closely with gold prices, given that its revenues are largely tied to royalty and streaming contracts based on the metal’s production and price levels. After a period of consolidation in gold prices amid easing inflation and stronger U.S. dollar trends, any rebound in gold—driven by renewed safe-haven demand, potential rate cuts, or geopolitical uncertainty—could provide a meaningful tailwind for RGLD. 
Since Royal Gold benefits directly from higher realized gold prices without bearing the operating costs of mining, even a moderate recovery in gold could translate into outsized cash flow and margin gains for the company. With physical gold showing signs of resilience and macro conditions turning more supportive for precious metals, RGLD may be well-positioned for an upswing alongside a broader gold price rebound.
But do these figures convey the entire narrative? Check Buy or Sell RGLD Stock to determine if Royal Gold retains a competitive advantage that stands up under scrutiny.
Stock picking often leads to disappointing results. High Quality Portfolio transforms insights from individual stocks into a solid market-beating portfolio strategy.
Stocks Like These Can Outperform. Here Is Data
Here is the selection process: We focus on stocks with a market cap exceeding $2 billion, high operating and cash flow (CFO) margins, no significant revenue declines in the last 5 years, a low-debt capital structure, and strong momentum as defined by our proprietary metric.
Below are statistics for stocks that adhered to this selection strategy between 12/31/2016 and 6/30/2025.
But Consider The Risk
However, RGLD is not exempt from significant drops. The stock declined almost 60% during the Dot-Com Bubble, 42% amid the Global Financial Crisis, and approximately 41% during the inflation shock. Even minor sell-offs, such as those in 2018 and the Covid pandemic, saw declines of 25% and 43%, respectively. Thus, while the stock boasts solid fundamentals, it can still experience downturns when the market falters.
The risk, however, is not confined to major market crashes. Stocks can decline even when markets are performing well – consider events such as earnings releases, business updates, and outlook revisions. Read RGLD Dip Buyer Analyses to understand how the stock has rebounded from sharp declines in the past.
The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has a proven track record of consistently outperforming its benchmark, which includes all three indices – the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000. What is the reason? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; resulting in a smoother ride, as illustrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics."

Beauty queens from around the world are soon set to arrive in Thailand for the start of the Miss Universe pageant, which will take place from November 2 to 21. And in the days leading up, there's been a major leadership shake-up behind the scenes.
On Wednesday, the organization announced that Anne Jakrajutatip was replaced as CEO.
Jakrajutatip made history as the first woman to own the 74-year-old pageant when her Thai-based company, JKN Global Group, purchased the organization from Endeavor for $20 million in October 2022.
She's being replaced by Mario Búcaro, a former diplomat who most recently served as the Miss Universe Organization's vice president for international relations.
Búcaro has previously worked as the ambassador of Guatemala to Israel, Mexico, Bulgaria, and Cyprus. He also served as Guatemala's Minister of Foreign Affairs for two years before joining Miss Universe.
Jakrajutatip and the Miss Universe Organization didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.
The organization said Búcaro will work alongside Raul Rocha, who will continue to serve as president, a title he has held since Jakrajutatip sold a 50% stake of Miss Universe to his company, Legacy Holding Group USA Inc., in January 2024.
Rocha didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Miss Universe said in its announcement that Búcaro helped the pageant expand ""its presence to over 130 countries."" As the new CEO, he will continue to focus on global outreach and ""enriching the candidate experience while upholding integrity and fairness.""
""The Board of the Miss Universe Organization expresses its full confidence in Mario Búcaro's leadership to guide the organization into a new era of growth and global influence,"" the organization added. ""His vision of Miss Universe as a worldwide movement that celebrates authenticity, transformation, and empowerment will continue to unite cultures, expand opportunities for women, and elevate the values that define our brand.""
When Jakrajutatip took over Miss Universe in October 2022, it was heralded as a historic new era. She gave a rousing speech at her first Miss Universe in January 2023, telling fans that the pageant was ""going to be run by women, owned by a trans woman, for all women around the world.""
Financial issues quickly followed.
In September 2023, Jakrajutatip's company missed a payment on a multimillion-dollar loan. In a letter to the stock exchange president, the company said, ""The financial liquidity management of the company is not in line with the expected forecast."" JKN Global petitioned Thailand's bankruptcy court at the time and said it planned to restructure its debt.
By June 2025, rumors began circulating that Jakrajutatip was stepping away from the Miss Universe Organization after Thailand's Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint against JKN Global. The complaint alleges that Jakrajutatip and her sister, Pimauma Jakrajutatip, included false or misleading information in the 2023 financial statements for the fiscal year and in the Q1 2024 accounting documents.
On June 6, JKN Global sent a letter to the president of Thailand's Stock Exchange confirming that the sisters had resigned and that a special audit was underway. The same day, the Miss Universe Organization said Jakrajutatip remained in charge of the pageant.
""We categorically deny any reports suggesting a change in leadership within the organization. Anne Jakrajutatip remains the chief executive officer of the Miss Universe Organization,"" the statement read.
However, in the new statement announcing Búcaro's succession, the Miss Universe Organization said Jakrajutatip had stepped down as CEO on June 20 and was now turning her focus to her family.
Before the 72nd Miss Universe competition in El Salvador, Jakrajutatip promised fans that the pageant was always ""my first priority in life.""
""Our universe must go on, must be great and must stay on top as the legendary Beauty Olympics in the World! I will sacrifice and do everything for the great success of OUR UNIVERSE!"" she wrote in a statement posted to Instagram in November 2023.
Jakrajutatip then became embroiled in several scandals of her own.
Miss Universe has shared similar struggles with the Miss USA pageant, which it oversees. Following two years of scandal under former CEO Laylah Rose, the organization announced in September that Thom Brodeur was taking over Miss USA and Miss Teen USA.
Brodeur told Business Insider he had four weeks to plan the 2025 pageants, which took place on October 23 and 24 in Reno, Nevada.
Now, pageant fans are waiting to see what's in store for Miss Universe.

58,2025-10-29,"It's an exciting start to a new era of XR devices, but even at half the price of Apple Vision Pro, it's still an expensive investment.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

The headlines since the Galaxy XR's launch have been pretty clear. Samsung's first Android XR-powered headset is fantastic, and it's being lauded as the more affordable Apple Vision Pro we've been asking for. But does that mean it's right for you?
That question depends entirely on what you plan to do with it, of course! Just like the Apple Vision Pro, Samsung and Google have posited that the Galaxy XR is for entertainment and productivity, with a little sidecar of gaming attached.
That means if you're looking to work on your headset and want an infinite canvas of monitors surrounding you at all times, the Samsung Galaxy XR is the best way to achieve that goal. Similarly, if you regularly find yourself at home disinterested in what everyone else is watching or playing, Galaxy XR is a great way to kick back and see or play what you want without being kicked off the TV again.

Why you can trust Android Central




Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.

 



Galaxy XR has the best screen ever in a VR headset, packing in an incredible 29 million pixels in a pair of micro-OLED panels. These panels are powered by the Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 2 chipset and, since Android XR runs the show, every single Android app on the Google Play Store works on the headset.
That means any streaming app, productivity app, or really any app at all can be found and used on the headset, so you don't need to wildly adjust your current habits to jump into Galaxy XR's amazing immersive views.
In fact, Galaxy XR is the only VR headset with an official Netflix app, so you get the full quality of every show and movie without worrying about browser compatibility or side-loading.

On top of that, it's easy to hook Galaxy XR up to a PC wirelessly with the Virtual Desktop app, or just natively hook up to a Galaxybook laptop with Samsung's built-in software. This way, you can not only work on your PC without hurting your neck (boy, do I hate looking down at a laptop for hours), but you also get the flexibility of multiple monitors, no matter where you are.
That means you can bring your laptop and headset with you on your next work trip and still feel like you're working at home. It also means long plane rides can be a way to relax and unwind with a giant virtual theater in front of you instead of a seat 15 inches from your face.
 



VR gamers will find that the Meta Quest 3 is a better buy for standalone VR games, as it has thousands of titles available through Meta's store. But PC VR gamers should seriously consider the Galaxy XR, as it's currently the best wireless headset for PC gaming.
That's because the Virtual Desktop app is able to pass Galaxy XR's face tracking, eye tracking, and hand tracking capabilities to your PC, allowing apps like VRChat to use this data to create more lifelike avatars. There's no other wireless VR headset on the market with this capability and power, making it the ultimate choice for wireless PC VR gaming enthusiasts.
Do you find yourself fitting into any of these three categories? If so, the Galaxy XR may just be the standalone headset you've been waiting for. It takes everything that was great about the Meta Quest Pro and improves upon it, delivering Apple Vision Pro-like visual fidelity with a new breakthrough in Android app support made possible by Android XR. It's a phenomenal solution for folks wanting the best of the best on the Android side of things.
 




Cutting-edge hardware meets the best XR operating system ever made. With every Android app on Google Play, bespoke XR apps from popular services, and an incredible new Gemini-powered assistant that can interact in never-before-seen ways, Samsung Galaxy XR is the start of a new generation of AR and VR devices.

We’re approaching the holidays fairly fast, but the big holiday sales events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday are still a month away. Luckily, you can still find some good opportunities to save even right now. If you’re a PC gamer in the market for a new primary or secondary monitor, now’s a great time to jump on it because Amazon has the Samsung Odyssey G4 gaming monitor on sale for 29% off: It’s normally listed at $280, but the discount has it knocked down in price by $80, bringing what you have to pay down to an even $200.
See at Amazon
This 25-inch monitor from Samsung is capable of delivering a clear depth of colors in a 1080p FHD resolution. It’s got a fast response time of just 1ms with a smooth refresh rate of 240Hz. The screen eliminates lag and will make any game that relies on fast inputs and quick reaction times a dream to play. That pogo platforming section in Hunter’s March from Hollow Knight: Silksong can be significantly easier on a better monitor.
The monitor has NVIDIA G-SYNC which is able to keep your GPU and panel synchronized. What this does is eliminate choppiness, screen-lag, and image tears. AMD FreeSync Premium can also help to ensure better stability and a stutter-free gameplay experience.
With this monitor, you can connect your PC or gaming console over either of the two HDMI inputs or through the DisplayPort input. If you have multiple sources connected to your Samsung Odyssey G4 display, the monitor can auto-detect when a new source signal is plugged in or turned on, changing the input over so you don’t have to manually. Get into the action faster.
This Samsung monitor is built with an ergonomic stand which can be raised and lowered to your liking. Tilt the angle of the screen toward or away from you to find the optimal viewing for how and where you are seated or standing at your desk. The screen can even be rotated to go either horizontal or vertical. This makes for a wondering secondary monitor. Keeping you main screen horizontal front and center is ideal for longer gaming sessions so you neck is always straight as your facing forward. Then you can have a second monitor positioned to the side of it vertically. This is great for Discord, Slack, or any kind of message apps so you can see more of the conversation at once.

The Nothing Phone 3A Lite is the company's most affordable phone yet.
British tech company Nothing unveiled the latest phone in its 3 series on Wednesday, bringing its signature flashy and semi-transparent design to a new audience at a more affordable price than it's usually known for. The Nothing Phone 3A Lite is a budget device designed to tempt people who love the company's style, but not the price of its other products.
Available in black and white, the phone is encased in glass, with visible screws that define Nothing's signature look. Fans of the brand will be aware of Nothing's flashy Glyph Interface that makes the rear of its phones glow to indicate notifications. The Nothing Phone 3A Lite comes with an ""evolution"" of this, which the company is calling the Glyph Light. It will offer customizable light sequences and other glowing features.
The rear of the Phone 3A Lite will feature the Glyph Light.
From what we've seen of the device so far, it's probably one of the coolest and quirkiest looking entry-level phones to hit the market this year. Usually phone-makers reserve design flourishes for their higher-end models, but for Nothing it's at the core of the company's DNA.
Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.
In terms of other specs, you can expect a triple-camera system with a 50-megapixel main sensor, a 6.77-inch AMOLED display and 5,000-mAh battery. Unlike the other phones in Nothing's 3 Series, the 3A Lite isn't powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor, but instead runs on a MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Pro chip. It arrives running Android 15 and Nothing OS 3.5, with an update to Nothing OS 4.0 scheduled for early 2026.
The Nothing Phone 3A Lite will come in black and white.
One initial disappointment in the phone is to see that Nothing is only committing to three years of major Android updates (albeit it's offering six years of security patches). It would have been great to see this phone able to offer owners true longevity, as well as a cool design at an affordable price.
The Nothing Phone 3A Lite will cost £249 ($329) with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, or £279 ($369) for 256GB of storage. That's around £70 cheaper that the Nothing Phone 3A -- not a massive saving, but a saving nonetheless. That's great news for people in the UK and Europe who are keen to get their hands on this new model. But it's less good news if you're based in the US.
""Phone 3A Lite will not be available in North America,"" a spokesperson for the company told me. ""Given the investment required to localise and scale this specific model, our focus is on markets where entry-level devices are a more natural fit and can serve as an introduction to the Nothing ecosystem.""
This isn't the case for the other phones Nothing has unveiled this year, which include the 3A Pro and flagship Phone 3 -- both of which are available in the US.
In all, 2025 has been Nothing's most prolific year yet. Not only has it released a range of new phones across its main brand and CMF sub-brand, it's also launched its first over-ear headphones, Headphone 1, with partner audio brand KEF.
""It's impressive that Nothing has now managed to launch five phones in one year,"" says Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight. ""It underlines its growing scale and determination to have devices across multiple tiers and segments"""

62,2025-10-29,"On Wednesday, the US central bank announced its second rate cut of the year.
By Andy Hirschfeld
Share
Save
The United States Federal Reserve has cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 3.75-4.00 percent, amid signs of a slowing labour market and continued pressure on consumer prices.
The cut, announced on Wednesday, marks the US central bank’s second rate cut this year.
“Job gains have slowed this year, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remained low through August; more recent indicators are consistent with these developments. Inflation has moved up since earlier in the year and remains somewhat elevated,” the Fed said in a statement.
“Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated.”
The cuts were largely in line with expectations. Earlier on Wednesday, CME FedWatch — which tracks the likelihood of rate cuts — said there was a 97.8 percent probability of rate cuts.
After the September cut, economists had largely been expecting two additional rate cuts for the rest of this year. Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, HSBC, and Morgan Stanley, among others, forecast one more 25-basis-point reduction by year’s end following Wednesday’s cut. Bank of America Global Research is the only major firm that is not anticipating another 25-basis-point cut in 2025.
“The Fed has a challenging line to walk; lower interest rates to support labour markets and growth, or raise them to tamp down inflation. For now, they are taking a cautious approach tilted a bit towards the growth concerns,” Michael Klein, professor of international economic affairs at The Fletcher School at Tufts University in Massachusetts, told Al Jazeera.
Despite forecasts, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said another rate cut isn’t necessarily inevitable.
“We haven’t made a decision about December,” Powell told reporters in a press conference, referring to the next rate decision meeting of the Fed.
“We remain well-positioned to respond in a timely way to potential economic developments.”
The cuts come as economic data becomes increasingly scarce amid the ongoing government shutdown, now in its 29th day as of Wednesday, making it the second-longest in US history, behind the 35-day shutdown during the first presidency of Donald Trump in late 2018 and early 2019.
Because of the shutdown, the Department of Labor did not release the September jobs report, which was scheduled for October 3. The only major government economic data released this month was the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which tracks the cost of goods and services and is a key measure of inflation. The CPI rose 0.3 percent in September on a month-over-month basis to an inflation rate of 3 percent.
That data was released because the Social Security Administration required it to calculate cost-of-living adjustments for 2026. As a result, Social Security beneficiaries will receive a 2.8 percent increase in payments compared to 2025.
The shutdown, however, could have a bigger impact on next month’s central bank decision as the Labor Department is currently unable to compile the data needed for its November reports.
However, amid the limited government data, private trackers are showing a slowdown.
“We are not going to be able to have the detailed feel of things, but I think if there were a significant or material change in the economy one way or another, I think we would pick that up,” Powell said.
Consumer confidence fell to a six-month low, according to The Conference Board’s report that was released on Tuesday.
The data showed that lower-income earners – those making less than $75,000 a year – are less confident about the economy as fears of job scarcity loom. This comes only days after several large corporations announced waves of layoffs.
On Wednesday, Paramount cut 2,000 people from its workforce. On Tuesday, Amazon cut 14,000 corporate jobs. Last week, big box retailer Target cut 1,800 jobs. This comes as furloughs and layoffs weigh on government workers. The US government is the nation’s largest employer.
Those making more than $200,000 annually remain fairly confident and are leading consumer spending that is keeping the economy afloat, according to The Conference Board.
Pressures both on consumer spending and the labour market are largely driven by tariffs weighing on consumers and businesses.
US markets are lower on the rate cut. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are both down by about 0.3 percent, and the Nasdaq is about even with the market open as of 3pm in New York (19:00 GMT).

Nokia stock (NYSE: NOK) is back in the spotlight. The Finnish telecom giant’s shares surged over 20% this week after Nvidia stock (NASDAQ: NVDA) revealed a $1 billion investment for approximately a 2.9% stake, forming a new alliance to develop AI-driven networking and 6G infrastructure.
For investors, this is not merely a fleeting headline. It’s an opportunity to reevaluate a company often viewed as a legacy player. With a market capitalization of $42 billion, Nokia delivers mobile, fixed, and cloud network solutions from 2G to 5G, and now, it’s seeking to position itself as a link between telecom and AI infrastructure. Let’s analyze how it compares.
Nevertheless, if you seek upward potential with reduced volatility compared to holding a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has substantially outshined its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has produced returns exceeding 105% since its inception. What explains this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided superior returns with lower risk than the benchmark index, minimizing significant fluctuations, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Additionally, take a look at – After A Hot Run For Gold, Will Stocks Take The Lead Again?
At first glance, Nokia does not seem to be a bargain. The stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 41x, compared to the S&P 500’s 24. Its price-to-sales and price-to-free cash flow ratios — at 2.2 and 33.3, respectively — also surpass market averages. This indicates that optimism has likely set in. The Nvidia partnership may warrant a premium, but the market is evidently betting on strong execution ahead. For investors, this implies that the narrative now rests on whether Nokia can provide sustained growth in a sector characterized by fierce competition and slim margins.
Nokia’s growth record has been inconsistent. Over the last three years, revenue actually declined at an average rate of nearly 6% per year, significantly trailing the S&P 500’s positive trend.
The positive news? Indicators of improvement are evident. In the last twelve months, Nokia’s revenue increased by almost 6%, reaching $20 billion, with its most recent quarter showing an 11.6% year-over-year increase. This upturn, bolstered by AI-related momentum and increased network demand, is one of the reasons the stock has attracted new investor interest.
However, the more significant challenge will be sustainability. Can Nokia transform temporary order surges into long-term, profitable growth? That remains an unanswered question.
Despite increasing sales, Nokia’s profitability lags significantly behind competitors. Operating margins hover around 3.7%, compared to the S&P 500’s 18.7%. Its net income margin, approximately 4.7%, presents a similar narrative — respectable for a hardware-heavy industry, but far from robust. Cash flow generation is somewhat stronger, with a 9.6% operating cash flow margin, or about $1.9 billion over the previous year. Still, Nokia must significantly increase margins if it aims to be recognized as a genuine AI-infrastructure contender rather than just a cyclical telecom supplier.
Where Nokia excels is in its balance sheet strength. Debt stands at only $4.1 billion with a modest debt-to-equity ratio close to 10%. The company also has $6.1 billion in cash, approximately 17% of total assets, which is considerably higher than the average S&P 500 peer.
In a capital-intensive sector, that financial cushion is crucial. It provides Nokia the capacity to invest in AI networking, support research and development, and manage downturns without incurring major dilution or distress.
Nokia’s stock history illustrates a narrative of vulnerability in the face of market shocks. It plummeted 54% during the 2022 inflation-driven downturn, significantly steeper than the S&P 500’s 25% drop, and it has not yet fully recovered to pre-crisis levels. The crash of 2008 was even harsher, with the stock dropping nearly 79% and never regaining those heights.
On a positive note, Nokia rebounded swiftly from the 2020 pandemic sell-off, regaining losses in just 81 days, outpacing the broader market. However, overall, the company's crisis resilience has fallen short, serving as a reminder that investor sentiment can shift dramatically when fundamentals weaken.
Nokia’s new collaboration with Nvidia could signify a pivotal moment, allowing the company to reposition itself as an AI-era infrastructure leader instead of a struggling telecom supplier. Nevertheless, the figures still narrate a mixed story: high valuation, uneven growth, thin margins, yet a robust balance sheet.
For the time being, investors ought to approach this as a high-risk, high-reward turnaround. Nvidia’s billion-dollar endorsement provides Nokia with new credibility — but only consistent execution and margin enhancement will convert that promise into lasting value.
You may wish to explore the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap benchmark (a mix of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to provide solid returns for investors. What accounts for this? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks presents a flexible strategy to exploit favorable market conditions while mitigating losses during market downturns, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics."

Today, Jamaica is surveying the damage left behind by Hurricane Melissa, a Category 5 storm that made landfall yesterday. The most populous part of the country, the capital Kingston, missed the brunt of the storm. The government says the international airport could reopen for relief flights as early as tomorrow. Meanwhile, the storm is battering the west coast of Cuba.

                Residents self-evacuate under pouring rain from Playa Siboney to safe locations ahead of the arrival of Hurricane Melissa, in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba, on Oct. 28.

The Israeli military carried out renewed strikes in the Gaza Strip yesterday, less than three weeks into a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The military says it was dismantling a Hamas tunnel in an area of Gaza where Israeli troops were stationed when militants opened fire, killing a soldier. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered immediate ""forceful strikes"" in Gaza. Gaza Civil Defense reports that the strikes killed about 100 Palestinians, including around 35 children. Israel says it killed 30 militants in the strikes. 
Air traffic controllers say working without pay this week due to the government shutdown is making a difficult job even harder. Maximilian Crawford, a controller at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, states that many controllers are living paycheck to paycheck and are now seeking financial assistance from loans or family members. The shutdown has disrupted flights across the U.S., and there is currently no end in sight.

The obesity rate among U.S. adults has declined to 37% this year, down from a high of 39.9% three years ago, according to a new survey by the Gallup National Health and Well-Being Index. The data indicate that GLP-1 weight loss drugs are having an impact. The number of Americans using injectable obesity treatments has doubled over the past year and a half. GLP-1 agonists, as the new treatments are known, were first approved for obesity treatment in the U.S. in 2021. Here's what is known about how the drugs' usage is bringing down the U.S. obesity rate:

Real-world asset (RWA) specialist Ondo Finance (Ondo) has expanded its tokenized securities platform to the BNB Chain BNB$1,117.22, bringing over a hundred U.S. stocks and ETFs to one of the most active blockchain networks.
The move opens access for BNB Chain’s 3.4 million daily users to buy and sell tokenized shares of companies like Apple or Tesla, as well as popular ETFs, around the clock thorugh Ondo Global Markets.
These assets are aimed primarily at non-U.S. investors who want exposure to U.S. markets but may be blocked by geographic or regulatory barriers.
Tokenized stocks took off earlier this year as digital brokerages and crypto exchanges, including Robinhood, Kraken, Bybit, Gemini started offering rading equities onchain.
Ondo’s expansion into BNB Chain brings it into closer competition with projects like Backed and Kraken's xStocks, which also offer tokenized financial assets on BNB. This step into BNB Chain deepens the tokenized stock market’s reach into Asia and Latin America, where BNB has a strong user base.
The broader tokenized stock market has more than doubled since August to nearly $700 million currently, according to data from RWA.xyz. Since its launch in September, Ondo Global Markets has become one of the largest players in the space, with around $320 million in total value locked, per RWA.xyz.

Both PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) and Keurig Dr Pepper (NASDAQ: KDP) have significantly underperformed the broader market this year. The S&P 500 index has posted a solid 17% gain, yet PEP’s stock price is essentially flat compared to the beginning of the year, and KDP’s stock is down about 10%.
Given this context, if you’re seeking exposure to the consumer staples sector, particularly in food and beverage, we believe KDP is the better pick.
As a direct competitor to PepsiCo in the soft drinks and non-alcoholic beverages sector, KDP offers a compelling case based on two key factors:
This disparity between valuation and performance may suggest that purchasing KDP stock is a better pick than PEP stock
Smart investing is not about making predictions; it’s about strategic allocation. Discover how Trefis’ partner Empirical Asset Management approaches it. The firm has incorporated High Quality Portfolio into its asset allocation framework.
OpInc = Operating Income, P/OpInc = Price To Operating Income Ratio
But do these figures provide the entire picture? Read Buy or Sell PEP Stock to determine whether PepsiCo possesses any advantages that remain stable upon closer examination. To provide some context, PepsiCo (PEP) markets beverages, snacks, dips, spreads, cereals, and mixes, offering a wide variety of convenient food items on a global scale.
This represents merely one method of assessing investments. Trefis High Quality Portfolio examines a broader range of factors and is designed to minimize stock-specific risk while providing upside potential.
One approach to evaluate whether PepsiCo stock is currently overvalued compared to other competitors is to examine how these metrics compared among companies exactly one year ago. In particular, if there has been a significant turnaround in the trend for PepsiCo over the past 12 months, then the likelihood of a reversal in the existing mismatch is heightened. Conversely, a continued underperformance in revenue and operating income growth for PepsiCo would strengthen the inference that the stock is overpriced relative to its peers and may not revert soon.
Purchasing based on valuation, while appealing, necessitates careful evaluation from various perspectives. Such a multifaceted analysis is precisely how we develop Trefis portfolio strategies. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics."

Microsoft and OpenAI have resolved a major dispute, addressing a lingering question ahead of the company's earnings on Wednesday.
On Tuesday's ""TPBN"" podcast, the show hosts John Coogan and Jordi Hays spoke with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella after the announcement, noting that he is now a ""peacetime CEO,"" as the dispute with OpenAI has been resolved.
""I think AI and everything that it entails is going to be a core driver, and some of it'll come from just this intelligence and this sort of continual march of capability,"" Nadella said in response to the hosts' question on what he expects from the OpenAI agreement. ""I'm always focused on long-term return.""
The two companies reached a deal that lifts restrictions that have limited OpenAI's ability to raise money since 2019, when it gave Microsoft sweeping rights to its work in exchange for billions in cloud computing power.
The landmark deal was announced just a day before Microsoft's third-quarter earnings release and call.
The deal would allow the ChatGPT maker to complete its restructure from a nonprofit to a for-profit company, which will give CEO Sam Altman greater authority to strike deals and steer the company as it embarks on its mission to build $500 billion worth of data centers over the next decade.
OpenAI initially started as a nonprofit but restructured following Altman's brief ouster in late 2023, forming a new for-profit arm called OpenAI Group PBC to allow the firm to function more like a traditional company. The nonprofit still governs the for-profit entity.
However, the original deal with Microsoft constrained OpenAI's ability to raise funds from outside investors and secure computing contracts even after its restructuring. That limit became a point of conflict between the two companies as ChatGPT's user base skyrocketed alongside the need for more computing power. OpenAI now boasts roughly 800 million weekly ChatGPT users and is working to build a series of large data centers across the country.
As part of the new deal, Altman won't receive equity in the new structure or any change to his $76,000 annual salary, and the company has not announced any plans to go public. Microsoft will retain its 27% stake in the AI giant and continue to hold certain rights to OpenAI products and AI models until 2032. Most of Altman's wealth comes from his role at the Y Combinator and his early investments in companies like Airbnb, Stripe, and Reddit.
Microsoft shares rose around 2% on Tuesday at market closing time after announcing the deal with OpenAI.
""OpenAI has completed its recapitalization, simplifying its corporate structure,"" Bret Taylor, Chair of the OpenAI Board of Directors, wrote in a blog post on Tuesday. ""The nonprofit remains in control of the for-profit, and now has a direct path to major resources before AGI arrives.""
OpenAI and Microsoft did not immediately respond to requests for comments.

69,2025-10-29,"David Foster and Yolanda Hadid's onetime Malibu estate has hit the market as a fire-scorched lot for millions ... TMZ has learned.
The 3.25-acre ocean view lot reduced to ashes in last year's Palisades Fire is on the market for just under $12 million, giving one lucky buyer the chance to rebuild a masterpiece.
The conceptual renderings by Bowery Design Group envision a 14,000-square-foot gated compound, with 6 bedrooms, 10 bathrooms, 14-foot ceilings, and sweeping 270-degree views of the Pacific Ocean.
The dream build also includes every luxury under the sun ... a theater, spa, gym, game room, and nearly 4,000 square feet of outdoor living space with three pools, a bocce court, and a full sports court.
The property still comes with La Costa Beach Club access and proximity to Malibu hot spots like Nobu, Soho House and the Malibu Pier.
Daniel Milstein, who holds the listing with Aaron Kirman of Christie's International Real Estate, tells TMZ ... ""This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to rebuild an iconic residence on a lot that is rarely available in proper Malibu. Thanks to Bowery Design Group we have a great vision as to what this property can be developed into.""
Yolanda and David first scooped up the home in 2007 for $4.5 million, transforming it into a European-style villa where the Hadid sisters spent their teen years before it became a TV famous backdrop on ""The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.""
In 2025, Yolanda listed her Pennsylvania farm and built a new home in Fort Worth, Texas, while David remains based in Los Angeles.

Nvidia shares rose more than 3.5% in premarket early on Wednesday—edging the AI chipmaker towards a $5 billion market cap—after President Donald Trump said he will discuss export controls on the company’s advanced Blackwell chips with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping when the two leaders meet on Thursday, in a bid to ease trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies.
Nvidia’s shares rose 3.6% to $$208.22 in premarket trading on Wednesday morning, continuing a rally from the previous day, when the stock closed nearly 5% up.
If the stock surge holds when markets open on Wednesday, Nvidia could become the first-ever company to hit a $5 trillion market cap.
The AI chipmaker’s market cap stood just below $4.9 trillion when markets closed on Tuesday.
While speaking to reporters on board Air Force One on Wednesday, Trump was asked if he had reached an agreement with Xi to potentially allow the export of Nvidia’s flagship Blackwell chips—which are currently subject to export controls—to China as part of a trade deal. The president said, “We’ll be speaking about Blackwells” as he praised the Nvidia chip, calling it “super duper.” Trump said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was “amazing” and added that the Blackwell chips are “probably 10 years ahead of any other chip.”"

73,2025-10-29," Nvidia (NVDA) became the first company to ever achieve a market capitalization of $5 trillion as its stock surged in early trading Wednesday.

 Shares were up 4.5% at $210 recently, after gaining 5% yesterday following a keynote address from CEO Jensen Huang at Nvidia's developers conference in Washington, D.C. where he highlighted the companyt's latest AI products and announced several deals.

 The chipmaker unveiled a $1 billion investment in Nokia (NOK), as well as a new strategic partnership with the Finnish tech firm in an effort to expand its AI infrastructure push. Nvidia also announced that it will collaborate with Oracle (ORCL) to build AI supercomputers for the U.S. Department of Energy and collaborate with Palantir Technologies (PLTR) on the development of an integrated AI technology stack.

 Nvidia shares have gained more than 50% since the start of the year as investors have piled into the stock amid strong demand for AI chips and optimism about the company’s ongoing growth prospects. The company's $5 trillion market cap is substantially higher than the next companies on the list of the world's most valuable—Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) have market caps around $4 trillion.

 Below, we break down the technicals on Nvidia’s chart and identify crucial price levels to monitor.

 Nvidia shares broke out from a rising wedge on Tuesday on the highest trading volume since late May, signaling buying conviction behind the move.

 Although chart watchers often associate this pattern as bearish, it can also indicate a bullish continuation rather than a reversal if it forms during a strong uptrend, as is the case on Nvidia’s chart.

 Meanwhile, yesterday’s breakout coincided with the relative strength index approaching overbought levels, though the indicator sits below its July peak, giving the stock further room to move into price discovery mode.

 Let’s use technical analysis to project a potential upside target on Nvidia’s chart and also identify two crucial support levels worth watching.

 Investors can project a potential upside target by using the measured move technique, a trading tool that analyzes well-known chart patterns to forecast future price movements.

 When applying the analysis to the chipmaker’s chart, we measure the distance between the rising wedge’s two upward sloping trendlines near their widest section and add that amount to the pattern’s top trendline.

 This projects a target of $220 ($25 + $195), indicating the price could climb to around this level before encountering potential resistance and entering a period of consolidation.

 The first support level to watch sits around $185. This area could attract buying interest near a range of corresponding price action on the chart stretching back to the start of the rising wedge pattern in early August.

 Finally, a deeper retracement could see Nvidia shares test lower support at the $165 level. Investors may look for entry points in this location near a trendline connecting last month’s low with the end of a brief pullback in late July.

Over the past decade, Broadcom stock (NASDAQ: AVGO) has delivered a significant $51 billion back to its shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. This extraordinary cash generation stems from Broadcom's position as a dominant supplier of mission-critical semiconductor chips and infrastructure software, where the company operates in markets with exceptionally high barriers to entry and generates industry-leading margins that convert revenue into pure cash flow. 
Broadcom’s cash machine operates on two highly profitable pillars: its semiconductor solutions business that generates $34 billion (LTM) with products so essential to data center, networking, and mobile infrastructure, and its infrastructure software division producing $26 billion through mission-critical enterprise software, including VMware's virtualization platform that customers rely on for their core operations. 
The company’s business model is particularly cash-generative because it focuses on high-margin, recurring revenue streams, allowing Broadcom to convert approximately $24+ billion annually into free cash flow from its $51.6 billion revenue base.
Let's examine some statistics and see how this cash return capability compares to the largest capital-return companies in the market.
Interestingly, AVGO stock ranks as the 53rd highest for total returns to shareholders in history.
Why should this matter to you? Because dividends and stock buybacks provide direct, tangible returns of capital to shareholders. They also indicate management’s confidence in the company’s fiscal health and capability to generate sustainable cash inflows. Additionally, there are numerous other stocks like this. Here’s a list of the top 10 companies ranked by total capital returned to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.
For comprehensive rankings, visit Buybacks & Dividends Ranking
What do you observe here? The total amount of capital returned to shareholders as a percentage of the current market capitalization seems inversely related to growth expectations for reinvestment opportunities. Companies like Meta Platforms (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) are experiencing significantly faster growth, more predictably when compared to their counterparts, but have returned a much smaller proportion of their market cap to shareholders.
This represents the downside of high capital returns. Certainly, they are appealing, but you need to ask yourself: Am I compromising on growth and solid fundamentals? Keeping this in mind, let’s review some data for AVGO. (Refer to Buy or Sell Broadcom Stock for more insight)
That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
That said, AVGO is not immune to significant downturns. It experienced a nearly 48% drop during the COVID-19 pandemic, around 35% during the 2021 inflation shock, and approximately 27% during the 2018 correction. See – How Low Can Broadcom Stock  Go – for more details. Even with robust fundamentals, it is evident that the stock can undergo substantial declines when market conditions change. Quality companies still suffer when market sentiment shifts abruptly.
However, the risk isn't confined to major market crashes. Stocks can decline even in favorable market conditions — consider circumstances like earnings reports, business announcements, and changes in forecasts. Check AVGO Dip Buyer Analyses to explore how the stock has rebounded from sharp declines historically.
Remember, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics."

Micron Technology (MU) stock has surged 35.5% over the past 21 trading days, driven by a wave of dealmaking aimed at expanding large-scale AI data centers. This build out is expected to fuel strong demand for high-bandwidth memory used in AI chips, helping suppliers like Micron. Adding to the optimism, the company’s peer SK Hynix recently forecast a “super cycle” in demand for memory driven by artificial intelligence.
 Currently, the stock appears to be fairly priced. Consider these data points:
While we appreciate riding the momentum if the fundamentals are sound – for MU, refer to Buy or Sell MU Stock – we remain cautious of potential bull traps. It’s particularly important to ponder if worst-case scenarios arise, such as MU falling 20-30% to the $155 levels; would we be able to hold onto the stock? What does the worst-case situation look like? We term this downturn resilience. Notably, the stock has performed significantly worse than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. We evaluate this based on (a) the magnitude of the stock’s decline and (b) the speed of its recovery.
Investing in a single stock can be risky, yet there is tremendous value in adopting a broader, diversified investment strategy. If you are looking for an upside with less volatility than what comes with holding a single stock, consider the Trefis High Quality Portfolio (HQ). The HQ portfolio has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap index—and has achieved returns surpassing 105% since its inception. Risk management is crucial—imagine how long-term portfolio performance could look if you integrated 10% in commodities, 10% in gold, and 2% in crypto along with HQ's performance metrics.
 
Below are the details, but first a brief background: MU produces memory and storage products, which include DRAM semiconductor devices, via segments that focus on compute, networking, mobile, storage, and embedded business units.
2022 Inflation Shock
2020 Covid Pandemic
2018 Correction
2008 Global Financial Crisis
It is important to consider how low MU might drop during a market downturn. Additionally, you should assess how the stock performed in comparison to the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which consists of 30 stocks and has a history of consistently outperforming its benchmark that includes all three—the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk relative to the benchmark index; providing a less volatile experience, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Gaming has evolved into a visual spectacle where every frame matters and your graphics card is the engine that powers those immersive experiences. The Asus TUF gaming GeForce RTX 5070 Ti brings professional-grade performance to your setup, and right now, early Black Friday deals are making this powerhouse more accessible than ever.
Amazon has slashed the price from $999 to $849 which marks an all-time low for this recently launched GPU that’s built on Nvidia’s cutting-edge Blackwell architecture. This is your chance to future-proof your gaming rig with 16GB of blazing-fast GDDR7 memory and DLSS 4 technology that transforms how games look and perform.
See at Amazon
Nvidia’s Blackwell architecture marks a real advancement in graphics processing. The RTX 5070 Ti uses that power with 16GB of GDDR7 memoryÂ which provides the bandwidth that modern games need. DLSS 4 revolutionizes gaming by using AI to generate frames intelligently. This allows you to increase ray tracing settings without seeing a drop in frame rates. The card runs at 2588 MHz in default mode and can reach 2610 MHz in OC mode. This gives you extra performance when you need it. These specs translate to smooth 1440p gaming at ultra settings and good 4K performance in most games.
Asus put a lot of thought into the cooling solution: They designed a 3.125-slot card with three Axial-tech fans that move a lot of air through a large fin array. The phase-change GPU thermal pad is a smart engineering choice. It lasts longer than regular thermal paste and keeps temperatures optimal, even during long gaming sessions that push the card hard. This design keeps your GPU cool and quiet, and avoid the loud noises that cheaper cards make under load. The extra slot width may seem like a compromise, but it is really an investment in durability. Cooler components last longer and maintain their performance over the years.
Durability is a priority with military-grade components that provide solid power delivery and a longer lifespan compared to standard designs: The protective PCB coating offers another layer of defense against moisture, dust, and debris that can cause short circuits. These features matter a lot, especially if you’re building a system you want to keep for several years.
Connectivity is also strong, with PCIe 5.0 support, multiple DisplayPort 2.1 outputs, and HDMI for maximum flexibility with monitors and VR headsets. The GPU Tweak III software allows you to control performance easily. You can adjust clock speeds, voltages, and fan curves without getting into complicated BIOS settings. Thermal monitoring helps you keep an eye on temperatures in different GPU areas.
At $150 off, this deal is a real value in a market where graphics card prices can often feel unrealistic.

PokÃ©mon Legends: Z-A 
One of the best parts of PokÃ©mon Legends: Z-A is that its single-city setting illustrates the power of community building and the importance of public services. Its cast of trainers come from different walks of life and all contribute something different to Lumiose City. However, weâre not here to talk about the streamer, socialite, or mob boss. Weâre here to talk about the true backbone of Lumiose Cityâs urban redevelopment plan: the PokÃ© Ball Collector.
These unnamed men show up throughout Lumiose, typically next to a PokÃ©mon Center, and if you ever see them with a yellow text bubble above their heads, you should talk to them immediately. See, these handsome gentlemen are part of the cityâs clean-up crew, but they focus on a specific type of trash littered around town: PokÃ© Balls. Every time you misthrow one of these capture devices at the local wildlife, these guys are right behind you, collecting these relics of your PokÃ©mon training failures to give them back to you so you donât have to buy more balls when perfectly good ones are lying around the Wild Zones.Â 
Crucially, he will only pick up ones that miss their target, not ones that fail to capture a PokÃ©mon because you didnât weaken them enough in battle. But even so, thatâs such a handy quality-of-life change that Iâm surprised it took PokÃ©mon nearly 30 years to implement. I guess it works best when your game is set in one city, and thus it makes sense to have dedicated systems and workers who can devote their shifts to this. But itâs especially helpful in a Legends game in which you throw PokÃ© Balls manually and can miss your target if youâre carelessly tossing them.
Now these collectors are amassing a ton of fans, and I wouldnât be surprised if we saw them featured in other PokÃ©mon media moving forward. A guy who picks up garbage and brings it back to you is just waiting for a trading card that lets you pick through your discard pile.

Sure, rumors about the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro are swirling around but here’s the real deal you need to know right now: The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro just dropped to an all-time low price on Amazon, and they’re crushing the competition, including Apple’s AirPods Pro. These earbuds combine top-tier active noise cancellation with cutting-edge AI features that adapt to your environment in real-time: Amazon slashed the price from $249 down to just $165, and over 30,000 people have already grabbed them.
See at Amazon
The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro have been totally revamped by Samsung from the ground up: The dual-driver design used in them stands them out in terms of design from almost every earbud existing on the market. In each earbud, there’s a 10.5mm dynamic woofer that’s complimented by a 6.1mm planar magnetic tweeter that’s driven by dual amplifiers. The two-way speaker design provides an outstanding separation of bass and high details.
This opens an incredible soundstage that’s as spacious as it gets considering that it’s an earbud. The stems on these earbuds aren’t only fashionable â inside them reside cutting-edge microphones that enable the adaptive functions and provide sound that’s as clear as it gets on calls that have a 15kHz bandwidth.
The adaptative active noise cancellation powered by Galaxy AI adjusts based on your environment and automatically reaches peak isolation levels throughout your daily routine. Riding on a crowded subway to work? The noise cancellation amps up to max isolation levels. Headed to your favorite coffee shop that’s a bit less crowded? The noise cancellation adjusts to save on battery life while still staying focused on your work.
The system automatically pairs perfectly with Siren Detect capabilities that automatically shift you to ambient mode as soon as it picks up emergency vehicle sounds. All of these come in conjunction with an adaptive equalizer that automatically adjusts based on the earbuds’ fit inside your ears. In plain sight, it adjusts sound profiles based on acoustic leakage. No matter whether it’s a workout routine or working at your desk, these earbuds deliver constant levels of optimized sound. The earbuds’ water-resistant rating of IP57 guarantees extreme durability despite exposure to rain or heavy sweating.
Galaxy AI integration offers capabilities that genuinely add value as opposed to just being catchy: The real-time interpreter offers face-to-face conversation translations via your earbuds. This overcomes language barriers during travel or international business meetings: The service enables you to answer calls in a given language and receive translations of those conversations in another. This functionality functions during earbud conversations via the Samsung Phone app.
Battery life provides the same six hours with ANC enabled and seven hours without it, which goes up to 26 hours when using the wireless charging case. The charging case design includes a transparent lid as well as an easy-to-carry design that fits perfectly inside your pocket. The charging slot for wired charging is positioned at the bottom of the charging case.
The earbuds come equipped with the latest connectivity of Bluetooth 5.4. They also feature Auracast that enables easy broadcasting of sound to nearby devices with Auracast capabilities. The company provides an additional two-year Amazon warranty exclusively for Samsung users.
All these factors combined at such an unbelievable low cost make the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro an incomparable value.

 Major U.S. equities indexes extended their record-setting run Wednesday afternoon ahead of an expected decision from the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all climbed to all-time highs.

 AI investor favorite Nvidia (NVDA) helped push the indexes higher after an event where it highlighted a flurry of partnerships. The shares climbed to a fresh high that lifted the chipmaker's market capitalization above $5 trillion, making it the first company ever to achieve that milestone.

 Caterpillar (CAT) shares surged to an all-time high as sales of AI power-generation equipment helped the maker of big machines beat earnings and revenue estimates.

 Teradyne (TER) shares also took off after the semiconductor and robotics firm posted better-than-expected results and offered an upbeat outlook as it benefited from AI demand.

 Fiserv (FI) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 after the financial tech provider missed profit and sales estimates, slashed its outlook, and shook up its executive team.

 Shares of Etsy (ETSY) tumbled after the online marketplace also announced a leadership change, with CEO Josh Silverman stepping down at the end of the year to be replaced by President and Chief Growth Officer Kruti Patel Goyal.

 Hormel Foods (HRL) shares fell after the maker of Spam, Skippy peanut butter, and other packaged foods warned current-quarter results could be hurt by price pressures, bird flu, and a fire at a peanut butter production plant. 

 Oil and gold futures advanced. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was little changed. The U.S. dollar was up on the euro and pound, but lost ground to the yen. Prices for most major cryptocurrencies were lower.

Nvidia on Wednesday became the first company in history to be valued at $5 trillion, the latest milestone by the artificial intelligence giant as shares have grown exponentially over the last decade. 
Nvidia’s shares increased by 3.4% to around $207.85 as trading opened Wednesday, following an earlier surge in premarket, setting a new intraday high for the stock.
An uptick pushed Nvidia’s market capitalization from about $4.89 trillion to $5.06 trillion, becoming the first publicly traded firm ever to surpass a $5 trillion valuation.
Nvidia remains the world’s largest company, ranking ahead of Microsoft ($4 trillion) and Apple ($3.9 trillion), which crossed the $4 trillion threshold for the first time Tuesday, as well as Google parent Alphabet ($3.2 trillion), Amazon ($2.4 trillion) and Meta ($1.8 trillion).
More than 44,000%. That’s how much Nvidia’s stock has climbed over the last decade, outpacing the Nasdaq (up 420%) and S&P 500 (263%) over the same period. A $1,000 investment in Nvidia when shares hit a low of $0.47 in February 2015 would now be worth $441,000.
Nvidia is worth more than Germany’s $4.6 trillion gross domestic product last year, which trailed China ($18 trillion) and the U.S. ($29.1 trillion) as the world’s largest economies.
Nvidia, valued at just over $10 billion in 2015, quickly became the world’s most valuable company as demand for AI hardware and software has skyrocketed. Among Nvidia’s largest customers are OpenAI, Elon Musk’s Tesla and xAI, Meta, Amazon and Oracle, whose similar market rise has boosted the net worth of chairman Larry Ellison to challenge Musk as the world’s richest person. The latest surge in Nvidia’s stock followed CEO Jensen Huang's announcement that the company expects $500 billion in AI chip orders, in addition to Nvidia’s plans to build seven supercomputers for the U.S. government. Nvidia also announced Tuesday it would take a $1 billion stake in Nokia, creating a new partnership with the networking firm to develop next-generation 6G technology.
Huang, who holds roughly 3% equity in Nvidia, has a net worth estimated at $174.4 billion, ranking him the eighth-richest person in the world. His fortune has grown alongside Nvidia’s market surge, rising from $2.7 billion in 2017 to $21.1 billion in 2023 before hitting $77 billion last year. "

88,2025-10-29,"The next-generation iPad mini 8 could feature an updated design that removes the speaker holes for improved water resistance, with Apple considering a new speaker system design. The new system would use vibration-based technology, according to Bloomberg, which would make it unique among Apple products if it's adopted.
It turns out there are already some devices on the market that use vibration-based sound, giving some insight into how the technology works and how Apple might implement the feature.

Apple could be planning to use a sound exciter, which creates sound waves by causing a surface like a glass panel or metal frame to vibrate. A piezo or electromagnetic exciter can use almost any surface for resonance, and there's no need for a standard speaker that sends vibrations through a diaphragm.
Apple could attach an exciter to the ‌iPad mini‌'s chassis or display. When playing audio, the exciter could vibrate the panel to move air and create sound with no traditional speaker or need for speaker holes.
The iPad has a decent-sized display that could support multiple exciters to allow for stereo sound, with the screen divided into sub-panels to serve as separate diaphragms.

Apple has patented a system similar to what's described above. Apple's ""mechanically actuated panel acoustic system"" patent describes an electronic device with an enclosure that's used as part of an acoustic system.
The enclosure is divided into sub-panels, and each sub-panel has one or more actuators to vibrate the sub-panel. The actuator and attached sub-panel then convert an audio signal to acoustic output.

Huawei's 2019 P30 Pro debuted ""Acoustic Display Technology,"" featuring an under-display speaker. It included a tiny exciter that vibrated the glass screen, turning the entire display into a speaker. An iFixit teardown revealed that Huawei was using a small coil with a magnet in the middle paired with a component that vibrated the screen to create sound.
Based on reviews, the Acoustic Display Technology worked well, but Huawei only used it for calls. All the rest of the smartphone's audio was routed through an additional bottom speaker, and the lack of stereo sound wasn't popular. Huawei released one more model with the technology, the P40, before returning to a more traditional system for subsequent smartphones.
Some TVs have used the technology to improve sound. LG's G8 ThinQ used the entire OLED display as a diaphragm, vibrating the screen to produce sound. LG paired it with a bottom speaker for stereo performance and to handle bass.
Sony's OLED TVs have used an ""Acoustic Surface"" for sound for several years. The TVs include multiple actuators behind the display that vibrate the screen to create sound. Sony says sound is precisely aligned with what you see, for a more immersive viewing experience. The technology is often praised in reviews of Sony TV sets.
It wouldn't be a surprise to see Apple adopt something like the Acoustic Surface, positioning it as a way for users to get immersive, spatial sound even when not wearing AirPods or other headphones that support spatial audio.
There are also plenty of ""invisible"" speakers that are meant to be mounted behind drywall or in ceilings. They use surface exciters to vibrate the material they're attached to, turning walls into speaker drivers.

Removing the speaker holes provide fewer paths for water ingress. The current ‌iPad mini‌ has speaker holes at the top and bottom of the device, and no water resistance rating.
It's not clear what water resistance rating the ‌iPad mini‌ might get. The iPhone has IP68 water resistance, which means it can withstand being under water that's six meters deep for at least 30 minutes.

If Apple eliminates speaker holes on the ‌iPad mini‌, microphone holes would likely remain. The iPad mini 7 has one microphone hole at the top and a second microphone hole located below the camera.
The ‌iPhone‌ also has microphone holes, so Apple could use gaskets and adhesive for water resistance without impacting functionality.

Bass is an issue with vibration-based audio systems. Sony, for example, integrates separate subwoofers in its TVs to add bass. Apple could use a similar hybrid solution, or use digital signal processing to make up for the missing bass frequencies.
Surface speakers can radiate mids and highs across the panel, but perceived width can be narrower because the vibration comes from a single surface rather than two separate drivers in different locations. If Apple uses actuators to vibrate the ‌iPad mini‌'s chassis or display, audio playback might not sound as full as stereo speakers do.
Touch can dampen sound by absorbing vibration. Apple could likely mitigate this with sensors that determine how the ‌iPad‌ is held, adjusting the vibration pattern accordingly.

Along with water resistance, rumors suggest the ‌iPad mini‌ 8 could be the first ‌iPad‌ other than the iPad Pro to get OLED display technology.
If implemented, Apple's vibration-based sound system could require some fancy audio processing. The ‌iPad mini‌ is expected to have the same A19 Pro chip that Apple introduced in the iPhone Air and the iPhone 17 Pro.

Apple could release the ‌iPad mini‌ 8 as soon as 2026.

Chegg's stock is down 99% as free AI tools like ChatGPT have made its paid homework help model obsolete, causing massive subscriber and traffic declines.The company faces severe financial distress, reporting significant revenue drops, operating losses, and negative cash flow despite extensive layoffs and leadership changes.Chegg's new AI initiatives have failed to create a unique value proposition, as students increasingly choose free alternatives over its paid services.
 
Chegg stock is down 99% from its all-time high.
Will sharp layoffs and artificial intelligence revive the shares of this 20-year-old online education company? 
Chegg decided to remain independent after a review by Goldman Sachs, according to TradingView, which I am guessing did not yield an offer to acquire the company at an acceptable price. 
Despite laying off 45% of its workforce -- or 388 employees – due to the “new realities” of artificial intelligence and diminished traffic from search engines like Google and plans for AI-driven revenue growth, as CNBC  reported, it may not be enough. 
With 7% of Chegg’s float sold short, according to the Wall Street Journal, I see two reasons to avoid these shares:
Chegg – which is reappointing Dan Rosensweig as CEO – is optimistic about its future. ""As I return to the CEO role, I’m confident Chegg has a bright future, and I look forward to exploring all paths to drive growth and enhance shareholder value,“ he said in a company statement.
Chegg – which offers textbook rentals, homework help and tutoring, as well as a newer suite of AI tools like a service that automatically generates flashcards – has seen its market capitalization  plunge roughly $14.5 billion in since peaking in February 2021.  
The company’s second quarter earnings report featured a big drop in revenue and disappointing guidance.
How so? Q2 revenue fell and the company lost money while disappointing investors on its forecast for Q3 revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. 
Revenue for the latest quarter was down 23% to $105 million while the forecast for the third quarter fell $10 million short of analysts’ expectations of $87 million, noted StockStory.
The company reported an operating loss of $36.5 million and $12 million in negative free cash flow in the second quarter. Chegg anticipates adjusted EBITDA of $7.5 million – nearly $6 million below the analyst consensus, StockStory reported.
The layoffs – the fourth round since June 2024 bringing the total to 1,396, according to the company, Inc., and other sources – culminate a long decline. Students are increasingly seeing no reason to pay for Chegg.
That’s because they can get free answers to their homework questions using OpenAI’s ChatGPT. In February, Chegg sued Google – which launched its own AI summaries – alleging these summaries reduced its traffic and sales.
Since ChatGPT’s November 2022 launch, Chegg has lost over 500,000 subscribers according to Gizmodo. Moreover, in November 2024, 62% of students planned to use ChatGPT (up from 43% in spring 2023) versus 30% for Chegg (down from 38%), according to a Needham survey featured in Sherwood News. 
Chegg’s competitive situation is weak. The company faces free alternatives that offer comparable or superior functionality, backed by companies with much greater resources. With universities providing free ChatGPT Enterprise accounts to students, why would they pay $19.95 a month for Chegg?
Google’s AI Overviews – which produce AI-generated summaries at the top of search results -- retain users on Google rather than sending them to third-party sites. Chegg’s non-subscriber traffic — historically driven by Google search for questions like ""how to solve quadratic equations"" — has been plunging: from  -8% in Q2 2024 to -49% in January 2025, reported the Washington Post.
Chegg’s competitive positioning appears not to align well with student behavior. The company considers its strengths to include education-specific accuracy with human verification, a learning-focused methodology, personalized learning with proprietary data, and integrating Chegg with other student services such as DoorDash, Prezi, and Tinder Gold, according to the company.
Yet these service attributes do not align well with the criteria that matter most to students. For example, actual behavior shows students migrate away from Chegg to a good enough result for which they pay nothing, according to Yahoo! Finance. 
What’s more, Chegg suffers from the perception students use it to cheat and universities track their usage to identify academic dishonesty, according to Sherwood News. Of 52 students interviewed in 2021, “aside from the half dozen students Chegg provided for Forbes to talk to, all but 4 admitted they use the site to cheat,” Forbes reported.
While Chegg has tried to reposition itself from providing homework answers to being a learning companion, students remain afraid of this risk.
Chegg’s original business model is now obsolete.  The company paid human contractors in India around $15 to $30 per answer to solve homework problems, archived those solutions, and charged students $19.95/month for access, explained Sherwood News.
Chegg’s efforts to introduce AI-powered services have not succeeded. CheggMate – essentially a ""thin wrapper"" around existing AI chatbots -- failed to stop the loss of subscribers, noted  TechSpot, nor did the company’s pivot to proprietary models using ScaleAI.  Chegg’s latest effort – ""Solution Scout"" puts a front end on others’ AI rather than building competitive technology, noted SeekingAlpha. 
For those looking to bet Chegg stock will go up, there are two reasons for hope: some cash – $114 million in June 2025 and the company’s acquisition of Busuu.
Chegg acquired Busuu – a language learning platform – for $436 million in 2022. Busuu generated about $43 million in 2024 revenues with 9% growth and 46% expansion in enterprise revenue from clients like Total Energy and Carrefour, according to TradingView.
One estimate puts Busuu’s standalone value at $430 million, according to Insider Monkey – $300 million more than Chegg’s market capitalization. I do not know whether Chegg can compete with the likes of DuoLingo nor how it will make students willing to pay for a service they can get for free – such as ChatGPT.
Analysts view the stock as undervalued – since it trades 16% below the Wall Street price target of $1.20, according to TipRanks.
Chegg is expected to burn through another $19 million in cash to cover the cost of eliminating 388 jobs – which would leave the company with some $95 million in cash. Will these cuts make the company cash flow positive?"

Nvidia just became the first company ever worth $5 trillion, meaning those who own even just a fraction of a percent of the high-flying stock are now super rich. The latest to join the billionaire club: 77-year-old venture capitalist and longtime Nvidia board member Brooke Seawell, who Forbes estimates is now worth $1.1 billion as of 10 a.m. Wednesday. Almost all of that wealth comes from his 0.02% stake in Nvidia, which was worth just $50 million five years ago; now it’s worth $900 million.
Seawell joined Nvidia’s board in 1997, when he was executive vice president at NetDynamics, an application server software company that was acquired by Sun Microsystems a year later. He joined venture capital firm Technology Crossover Ventures as a partner in 2000 and moved five years later to New Enterprise Associates, where he remains a venture partner today. During his 50-year career as an operating executive and VC, he’s been involved in 12 IPOs, including Nvidia and data visualization company Tableau, as well as 13 acquisitions. He is also a director of publicly-traded cybersecurity company Tenable Holdings and solar financing startup GoodLeap.
In addition to his 0.02% Nvidia stake, Forbes estimates that Seawell has also netted more than $100 million after tax from exercising Nvidia options over the years and selling the underlying shares. That includes more than $75 million raked in during 2025 alone. Seawell, who has a bachelor’s degree and MBA from Stanford, lives in Atherton, California, where he owns a nearly 10,000 square-foot home, with seven bedrooms and ten bathrooms, which Forbes estimates is worth $20 million. Before attending business school, Seawell served for three years in the U.S. Navy as a lieutenant running a computer programming group. He is an avid cyclist who has taken two dozen cycling vacations around the world.
Nvidia now boasts six billionaire backers, including Seawell and three other venture capitalists and long-time board members: Mark Stevens (estimated fortune: $11.8 billion), Tench Coxe ($8.9 billion) and Harvey Jones ($2 billion). Nvidia’s chief financial officer Colette Kress also joined the three-comma club earlier this year and is now worth an estimated $1.1 billion. The richest Nvidia billionaire by far is cofounder and CEO Jensen Huang, who boasts an estimated $184 billion fortune, making him the eighth-richest person in the world, according to Forbes’ real-time billionaire tracker.
Seawell’s fortune stretched into ten digits Wednesday morning, when Nvidia’s shares climbed by 5% as of 10 a.m. after the company announced the latest in a string of high profile-deals on Tuesday: a $1 billion investment in Nokia that will help the Finnish telecom giant use AI to transition from 5G to 6G. President Trump also told reporters on Air Force One Wednesday morning that he may speak to Chinese President Xi Jinping about Nvidia’s chips when the two heads of state meet on Thursday. Those developments helped boost Nvidia’s market cap to a record $5.1 trillion as of 10 a.m. The company, which became the first firm to hit a $4 trillion market cap in July, has seen its shares soar by 50% this year amid the AI boom, which has generated a surge in demand for Nvidia’s chips.
Nvidia has also struck AI infrastructure deals earlier this year with companies like OpenAI and Oracle. These agreements, which are worth hundreds of billions of dollars, have been criticized by some for their seemingly circular nature, leading many to speculate about an AI bubble bursting. But, for now at least, Seawell and his five fellow billionaires from Nvidia are sitting pretty on Forbes’ ranking of the world’s richest people."

Meta Platforms is scheduled to report earnings after Wednesday’s close. The stock recently hit a record high near $796.25/share and is currently trading near $746. The stock is prone to big moves after reporting earnings and can easily gap up if the numbers are strong. Conversely, if the numbers disappoint, the stock can easily gap down. To help you prepare, here is what the Street is expecting:
The company is expected to report a gain of $6.61/share on $49.34 billion in revenue. Meanwhile, the so-called Whisper number is a gain of $7.21/share. The Whisper number is the Street's unofficial view on earnings.
The company has grown its earnings nicely over the last several years. In 2020 the company earned $9.78. In 2021, the company earned $13.77. In 2022, earnings fell to $8.59. Then, in 2023 earnings soared to $15.56. In 2024, earnings jumped to $23.86 and are expected to grow to $28.29 in 2025. In 2026, earnings are expected to grow again to $30.19. Meanwhile, the stock sports a price to earnings ratio of 27 which is around the same (1x) the S&P 500. 
Technically, the stock is acting strong and is building a new bullish base after recently hitting a fresh record high. Currently, the stock is trading around 6% below its all-time high which is bullish considering it was down double digits from its record high earlier this year. Near-term support is the 50 day moving average (DMA) line and then the 200 DMA line. The stock can easily gap up and that’s what the bulls want to see after earnings are announced. Conversely, the bears want to see it gap down and fall.  
Meta Platforms, Inc. engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. It operates in two segments, Family of Apps and Reality Labs. 
The Family of Apps segment offers Facebook, which enables people to share, discuss, discover, and connect with interests; Instagram, a community for sharing photos, videos, and private messages, as well as feed, stories, reels, video, live, and shops; Messenger, a messaging application for people to connect with friends, family, communities, and businesses across platforms and devices through text, audio, and video calls; and WhatsApp, a messaging application that is used by people and businesses to communicate and transact privately. 
The Reality Labs segment provides augmented and virtual reality related products comprising consumer hardware, software, and content that help people feel connected, anytime, and anywhere. 
The company was formerly known as Facebook, Inc. and changed its name to Meta Platforms, Inc. in October 2021. The company was incorporated in 2004 and is headquartered in Menlo Park, California.
From where I sit, the most important trait I look for during earnings season is how the market and a specific company reacts to the news. Remember, always keep your losses small and never argue with the tape.

E-commerce now spans two models: large-scale platforms like eBay and niche marketplaces like Etsy. While both connect buyers and sellers, their growth and valuations differ sharply — a gap that may signal an overlooked investment opportunity.
ETSY serves as eBay’s counterpart in the Broadline Retail sector, which possesses:
1) A lower valuation (P/OpInc) in comparison to eBay stock2) However, it showcases greater growth in revenue and operating income
This disparity between valuation and performance may indicate that purchasing ETSY stock is a preferable option compared to EBAY stock
Fond of the EBAY stock? That's wonderful. But don’t become overly attached. Stocks can plummet. High Quality Portfolio helps you manage that risk.
Buying based on valuation can be appealing, but it must be assessed from various perspectives. This multi-faceted analysis is precisely how we develop Trefis portfolio strategies. If you seek appreciation with a smoother experience than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P and recorded over 105% returns since its inception."
