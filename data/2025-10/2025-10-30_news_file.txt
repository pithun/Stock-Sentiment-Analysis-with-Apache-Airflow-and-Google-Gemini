Good morning! Moving to a new city is hard enough, let alone with a couple of young kids. But a stay-at-home mom told BI her children were the key to making friends in a Houston suburb. It's the final story in a BI series that followed three people for a year to understand the realities of relocating your life.
You can also read about a woman who was paid to move from Los Angeles to Georgia and a couple who changed coasts when one of them got into Harvard.
In today's big story, Amazon's massive layoffs have people nervous about widespread culling in the white-collar workforce. How realistic are those fears? (And is AI really to blame for all of this?)
I'm also hosting a live discussion on that very topic at 2 pm EST on YouTube. I'll be joined by our resident Amazon expert Eugene Kim and our workplace whiz Aki Ito. More details here. And if you have questions you want answered, shoot me an email here.
What's on deck:
Markets: The stock market usually loves November. Here's where to put your cash.
Tech: Big Tech's AI spending knows no limit.
Business: Who is in, and who is out, on Elon Musk's $1 trillion pay package.
But first, is that a canary?
If this was forwarded to you, sign up here.
First came Amazon. Then came …?
The dust is settling on the meteor-sized layoffs that hit Amazon this week. But concerns are already growing about another deep impact that could hit a wider swath of the white-collar workforce.
As brutal as Amazon's 14,000 job cuts were, they don't make that much of a dent in the broader labor market, or even the tech giant's wider workforce that's roughly 1.6 million strong.
But if Amazon opened the door for other companies to conduct layoffs of their own, some fear things could get ugly.
So what would it take? About 20 more Amazon-sized layoffs would send the labor market off the rails, writes BI's Bartie Scott, Andy Kiersz, and Madison Hoff.
That might feel a long way away, and in many ways it is, but it's also not out of the realm of possibility. After all, companies are known to follow the lead of their bigger peers.
In late 2022, Meta cut 11,000 jobs to kick off its ""Year of Efficiency"" in 2023. The rest of corporate America took notes, and eventually, some 250,000 people were affected.
Further complicating matters is the current lack of hiring. The ""Great Freeze"" has kept companies in a holding pattern, refraining from hiring or firing. But if companies start letting people go without replacing them, the somewhat resilient job market could start to show some real cracks.
I know what you're thinking: Curse you, artificial intelligence!!
AI has been the lead suspect following the autopsy of Amazon's recent cuts. I include myself in that group, as I wrote about the potential for an AI-led job apocalypse in yesterday's newsletter.
But there's a counter-narrative to the AI-took-our-jobs take. As BI's Peter Kafka asks: Are we sure we're losing jobs to AI?
Companies typically need to cite some reason for laying off thousands of employees. And since AI is the topic du jour that tech is now banking on, it's an easy scapegoat.
What's the alternative? Executives acknowledge that they messed up? They admit they overhired when business was booming, and now they're being forced to adjust?
""I see this as mainly a correction to pandemic-era dynamics rather than some new thing like AI that's striking these companies,"" Ernie Tedeschi, a nonresident senior fellow at The Budget Lab at Yale, told Business Insider.
Yea, I'd go with the AI excuse, too.
1. Amazon's stock consistently finished last in its Magnificent 7 cohort. Over the past five years, the retail giant's shares have been up 43%, but that's compared to Nvidia's 1,521% gain. And even trails the wider S&P 500. Meanwhile, investors are concerned Amazon is being outdone in the AI arms race.
2. The Fed cut rates for the second time this year. As anticipated, the central bank made a quarter-percent rate cut. On the plus side, borrowers could start feeling the relief. On the downside, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said there are no guarantees another rate cut will come in 2025.
3. It's the most wonderful time … for stocks. November is historically the stock market's best month — and the odds are looking in favor of that this year, too. Bank of America shared its ideas for where to invest, based on
1. Five trillion reasons to smile. Nvidia became the first company to reach a $5 trillion market capitalization on Wednesday, in part because of how much it's spending on data centers. It's the cherry on top of a very good week for CEO Jensen Huang, who saw his personal wealth increase by more than $17 billion.
2. Meta stock slides despite earnings beat. The stock plunged 9% in after-hours trading after Mark Zuckerberg's company reported that it paid a $16 billion one-time tax charge this quarter. It beat Wall Street's expectations but missed on earnings per share.
3. Talk of an AI bubble isn't slowing Big Tech. Google, Meta, and Microsoft all reported increased spending on AI infrastructure on Wednesday, raising guidance and signaling even higher investments in data centers and chips through 2026. Some investors, meanwhile, are debating whether the AI boom has become a bubble.
1. The boomer property tax revolt. Home values have skyrocketed, and property taxes have risen with them. Older Americans are sick of it — but eliminating property taxes would hurt millennials and Gen Z, who rely on the local services they fund.
2. Who's for and against Elon Musk's $1 trillion payday. Tesla shareholders are set to vote next week on the compensation plan that could potentially make Musk the world's first trillionaire. Here's where major shareholders like Cathie Wood, Wedbush Securities, and the New York State Retirement Fund stand on the proposal.
3. Protein is helping Starbucks bulk up its comeback. CEO Brian Niccol said offerings like protein cold foam and protein lattes were helping to drive turnaround efforts at the coffee chain. As a result, gains-minded rewards-program members are getting in the door more often.

Docusign has lost almost a quarter of its market value this year on concern that new AI tools could help customers create in-house version of the software it sells.
The company is trying to head off this risk by integrating with the most disruptive AI player of all, OpenAI's ChatGPT.
Docusign is bringing its contract-management technology directly into ChatGPT, letting users draft, manage, and sign agreements without leaving the popular AI chat interface. 
Docusign's new ChatGPT integration is an effort to align with OpenAI instead of competing with it. That could reassure investors that its SaaS offerings can remain indispensable in an AI-driven world. Docusign shares jumped about 4% after the news.
At its annual Docusign Discover developer on Thursday, the software company announced that its Intelligent Agreement Management platform will soon connect to ChatGPT through the open-source Model Context Protocol.
The integration means users, and eventually AI agents, will be able to handle contracts end-to-end inside ChatGPT, from drafting purchase orders to identifying expiring vendor agreements and sending them for electronic signature.
Docusign's IAM system powers more than one billion agreements a year across 1.7 million organizations. Embedding it in ChatGPT could make contract workflows as simple as typing a prompt such as ""Create a one-year residential lease in Dallas for $2,000 per month"" or ""Find all contracts expiring this quarter and start renegotiations.""
Docusign stock slumped recently after OpenAI showed off several in-house software tools it had developed using AI. One was even called DocuGPT. It automates Parses contracts into searchable data, flagging unusual terms for finance teams, a potential threat to DocuSign's contract analysis features.
The partnership underscores how AI is blurring the lines between conversation and execution, moving business users from ""chat to contract"" in one secure flow. It also positions Docusign as one of the first enterprise-grade agreement-management providers to integrate with OpenAI's rapidly expanding ecosystem, including the 4 million-plus developers using OpenAI's AgentKit tools.

An anonymously sourced report from Reuters claims that OpenAI is planning an initial public offering that would value the AI colossus at “up to $1 trillion.” Just on Tuesday the company formally completed its slow evolution from an ambiguous non-profit to a for-profit company. Now it appears to be formalizing plans to become one of the world’s centers of economic powerâat least on paper.Â Â 
The $1 trillion report comes from “three people familiar with the matter.” Reuters’ sources claimed that OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar has been telling OpenAI “associates” that an IPO is coming in 2027, but that actually it could come in late 2026.Â 
Judging by the current ranking of companies by market capitalization, a $1 trillion valuation would make OpenAI the 12th most valuable publicly traded firm on Earth, just below Berkshire Hathaway, and just above JPMorgan Chase and Walmart.Â 
A publicly traded OpenAI would make for a fascinating case study, since shareholders really do expect companies to bring in money instead of just spending itâsomething OpenAI has notoriously had a hard time doing so far. As Elon Musk once put it, “There’s immense pressure on a public company to not have a bad quarter.”Â 
Becoming public can force a lot of information about a company’s real value into public viewâquarterly and annual reports on finances most famously, but also everything about the company’s history that goes in an IPO prospectus. Institutional investors buy shares based on that prospectus, and when the company does go public, its merits can be judged harshly by Wall Street traders, as happened with Uber when it went public in 2019, and its stock price immediately plunged. Companies can also sense which way the wind is blowing if things aren’t going well, and withdraw an IPO before the company gets humiliated, as happened with Ari Emmanuel’s talent agency Endeavor Group in the same year as Uber’s humiliating debut.
In a livestream on Tuesday, Sam Altman made similarly grandiose claims about 13-figure sums of money. According to Axios, he said eventually he’d like to build one gigawatt’s worth of new data center capacity per week, which he expects to cost 20 billion per gigawatt. Add it up yourself, and that’s over $1 trillion per year. “Eventually we need to get to hundreds of billions a year in revenue, and we’re on a pretty steep curve towards that,” he claimed. 
He also added (again, per Axios) that going public “is the most likely path for us given the capital needs that we’ll have and, sort of, the size of the company.”Â

OK. Now the bubble is definitely real ...
I mean, hey, Nvidia is worth 5 Trillions for some fucking reason.You would think that somewhere along the way, we would have found our stop and gotten off this senseless ride, but some people just want to watch the trainwreck happen... While inside the train.
And it's going to pop right after you stop being solvent
Right.  I want to short this so badly, but... what you said.
Company who is estimated to have lost $16bn net over its operating life and is projected to double those losses next year eyes wildly insane overvaluation.
Infinite spend, and really, in the new economy, profits and losses aren't the best metric, you see, what you really need to care about is the velocity of money because at some point the loss counter wraps around to a positive number.
And they said poetry is dead.Fools.Poetry is the most powerful force in the world, as long as its poetry about asking other people to give you money / complaining about immigrants.
In Springfield,they’re eating the dogs,the people that came in,they’re eating the catsThey’re eating the petsof the people that live there.
No-one cares about profits any more. They just want to IPO and exercise their stock options before the bubble bursts.
Profits are for losers.
Have they forgotten that they have a lot of competition? Meta, Google, Anthropic being just a few names here - not to mention China and the ais they're working on, not to mention Grok, which i've always found a shitty ai but seems to be deeply loved by the kind of people who want nothing more than to lick elons butthole.
Are all these company's ais worth 1 trillion or does openai have something special? I've found lately that gemini is less annoying to talk to and have been using it more than chatgpt. Claude 
It takes your money to fill Sam's pockets and he wants to have the very biggest pockets.
A public company can't innovate, especially nowadays. If they IPO, they're done.
Got 99 problems but a lack of funding ain't one.
I am going to laugh my ass off when this bubble bursts and all the dumbasses who don't know about the sitcom crash lose their shirts. Open AI has the biggest burn rate in history, it can't make enough money to make up for capex, it's funding and spending deals with Microsoft, Nvidia, AMD, and Oracle are circular bullshit, and the big Stargate data center won't have enough reactors to power it for over a decade. This is insane and people dumb enough to buy in deserve to lose their money.
With 1 billion terminal sessions made per week to its mainframe cloud, IBM spins off its thriving hosted mainframe business. The IPO is valued at 1 Trillion dollars.
Then the microprocessor and PC revolution breaks.

Workers have been begging for the Great Freeze to thaw — but not this way.
With hiring largely frozen in the US, any uptick in firings could set off alarm bells. Just this week, Amazon slashed 14,000 jobs; Paramount laid off about 1,000; and UPS announced it's shrunk by thousands more than expected this year.
It's still a drop in the bucket — in terms of both Amazon's overall head count and the broader economy — and there's no guarantee that a wave of companies will follow suit. The overall labor market has been averaging 1.7 million layoffs a month, and we're not in a recession yet.
However, new jobs are hard to find these days, and companies are abuzz with reasons to trim head count. Amazon, IBM, and Microsoft have all cited AI in cuts. Plus, there's general tariff uncertainty, and a need to correct for pandemic overhiring.
It's a swirl of factors that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is watching closely — especially as the government shutdown prevents the flow of official data.
""You see a significant number of companies either announcing that they are not going to be doing much hiring or actually doing layoffs, and much of the time they're talking about AI and what it can do,"" he said, in a Wednesday press conference following the latest interest-rate cut.
""It takes some time for it to get in there,"" he added, referring to official government data, much of which is on hiatus during the government shutdown. ""But we're watching that really carefully.""

Firing contagion isn't unprecedented. As Aki Ito wrote for Business Insider, Meta's 11,000 job cuts in late 2022 kicked off a firing spree across Silicon Valley and Corporate America, eventually affecting more than 250,000 people.
However, the economists we spoke to weren't too worried yet.
Guy Berger of Guild told Business Insider that these layoff waves over the past few years feel like ""The Boy Who Cried Wolf."" He said it would take a lot of company layoffs ""to move the meter.""
""These mass layoff announcements have not been representative of what most companies in the United States are doing; they're outliers that get a lot of attention,"" Berger said, adding, ""maybe finally other firms start following their footstep, but so far it has not happened.""
Even if hiring stays frozen, it would take a lot of Amazon-sized events to really set off alarm bells: During the Great Recession, for example, layoffs were regularly over 2 million a month — 300,000 more than this year's monthly average. That works out to around 20 Amazon layoff announcements' worth of cuts a month to make things really scary.
Ernie Tedeschi of Yale's Budget Lab said it would take a bit more.
""Layoffs in good labor markets still often flirt with 2 million (especially now that our population is larger),"" he wrote in an email to Business Insider. ""But the one time we broke 2.5 million was the legit scary months of early 2009.""
As Dana Peterson, chief economist at The Conference Board, said, the tech sector's churn doesn't reflect the full job market.
""C-suites are much more strategic than that, and they're not going to just start doing something because other firms are doing it without a reason,"" Peterson said. ""We need to remember that there are still several industries that are suffering from labor shortages.""
These industries, like healthcare, will continue to need to staff up, especially as more people retire.
Claudia Sahm, the chief economist for New Century Advisors, said layoff announcements can at least give the direction, but not the magnitude, of what's happening in the job market.
""Layoff announcements, first and foremost, are about the companies,"" Sahm said. ""They're business decisions. And so Amazon's a very large company, but it is not the US labor market.""

8,2025-10-30,"Amazon's stock popped more than 13% on Thursday afternoon after the company reported huge growth in the third quarter, including in its cloud business, Amazon Web Services.
CEO Andy Jassy said AWS was ""growing at a pace we haven't seen since 2022."" He also called out particularly strong demand for its AI offerings.
""We continue to see strong demand in AI and core infrastructure,"" Jassy said.
The company's results exceeded Wall Street's expectations, offering investors a sigh of relief, particularly as Amazon's stock has been the laggard of the Magnificent Seven this year.
""This banner quarter could mark a turning point for investor sentiment and set the stage for Amazon to reclaim a leadership role among large-cap tech stocks heading into year-end,"" Ethan Feller, stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research, said on Thursday afternoon.
The earnings report came after Amazon earlier this week said it would be cutting 14,000 jobs in one of the biggest rounds of layoffs in its history.
Jassy told analysts on Thursday's earnings call that the layoffs were ""not financially driven"" and were instead about making the company faster after years of head count growth.
Amazon's stock is up 13% in after-hours trading as the company's earnings call ends.
AI agents could become a big part of how people shop online, but there's still room for improvement, Jassy said.
Many shopping agents don't have access to shoppers' purchase history, limiting how good their suggestions are. They also often mess up basic information, such as an item's price, he said.

Many shopping agents don't have access to shoppers' purchase history, limiting how good their suggestions are. They also often mess up basic information, such as an item's price, he said.
That will likely change, though. ""I do think that we will find ways to partner"" with AI shopping tools, he said.
Jassy said that Tuesday's layoffs were ""not financially driven."" Instead, he said, it's about culture.
Amazon grew its head count over the past few years, which ""can weaken the ownership"" of Amazon employees who ""are doing the actual work"" and slow down key decisions, Jassy said. He added that Amazon wants a flat, fast organization.
Jassy said Whole Foods is growing faster than most grocery chains. He also told analysts to expect more locations for Whole Foods Daily Shop, the chain's latest small-format grocery.
Amazon is ""most excited about"" the ability to deliver perishable groceries for same-day delivery. Jassy added that the ability to order fresh foods multiple times a week for delivery, like Amazon provides, is part of the reason more customers are avoiding a weekly stock-up.
Jassy said that Amazon will always offer customers multiple chip options, including those from rivals like Nvidia.
At the same time, he said, Amazon's in-house chips make it different from other tech players. Amazon's Trainium chips, including its Trainium 3, will offer customers better value, especially as they try to use AI more broadly, he said.
The first question asked how capacity-constrained AWS is right now.
Jassy said that Amazon increased capacity during the quarter. The company plans to double its capacity by the end of 2027.

Jassy said that Amazon increased capacity during the quarter. The company plans to double its capacity by the end of 2027.
There's also lots of interest from customers in Amazon's Trainium chip, Jassy said.
Amazon expects capital expenditures of about $125 billion for 2025, CFO Olsavsky said. That's above the $118.76 billion that analysts polled by Bloomberg were expecting.
That will increase in 2026, he adds.

That will increase in 2026, he adds.
For the third quarter, Amazon's capex was $34.2 billion.
Jassy highlighted the fourth quarter as a key one for Amazon, with the holiday shopping season and AWS's re:Invent conference scheduled for December, before handing the call over to CFO Brian Olsavsky.
Jassy said that Amazon sees opportunities to grow advertising around Prime Video, adding that live sports have gotten a lot of interest from advertisers.
For the third quarter, advertising services net sales rose 24% to $17.7 billion.
Jassy said Rufus had 250 million active users this year, and that customers using Rufus during a shopping trip were 60% more likely to complete a purchase.
Amazon is on track to beat its delivery speed record again this year for Prime members, Jassy said.
Jassy said a new option that lets customers add items to orders they've already scheduled has been used 80 million times.
Jassy highlighted how some Amazon agentic coding tools have saved time and money for its clients.
Kiro, for example, attracted about 100,000 developers in an initial preview, and the number of users is now more than double that.
Amazon CEO Andy Jassy kicked off the call by talking about AWS, teasing unannounced deals worth more than all new deals in its third quarter.
He also briefly mentioned that Amazon's competitors have smaller annual revenue than AWS does.
CEO Andy Jassy, CFO Brian Olsavsky, and head of investor relations Dave Fildes are kicking it off with prepared remarks.
Shares of Amazon are 11% higher in after-hours trading as the company's earnings call is about to begin.
Amazon grew the number of rural communities that had access to same-day and next-day delivery by 60% over the past four months, it said in its earnings release.
The e-commerce giant is increasingly competing with Walmart and Dollar General as it offers faster delivery in small towns and other sparsely populated parts of the US.
Amazon's earnings show that the company is ""firing on all cylinders after a year of relative underperformance,"" Ethan Feller, stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research, said on Thursday afternoon.
The results are also a good sign for Amazon's standing in relation to the other Big Tech stocks, Feller said.

""Despite lagging the Magnificent Seven and the broader market for much of 2025, the company's fundamentals never meaningfully weakened,"" Feller wrote. ""This banner quarter could mark a turning point for investor sentiment and set the stage for Amazon to reclaim a leadership role among large-cap tech stocks heading into year-end.""
Amazon's third-quarter results show the company is making progress in adding AI to its operations, Investing.com's senior analyst Jesse Cohen said.
""Although AWS sales fell slightly short of projections, the division still achieved its fastest growth pace since 2022, underscoring the robust demand for cloud services,"" Cohen wrote.

Amazon's Prime Day event in October has become an early chance for shoppers to score holiday deals, and other retailers have even debuted their own versions. On Thursday's call, Amazon could provide an early glimpse into how holiday shopping is shaping up.
Expect Amazon to play a big role once the holiday shopping season starts in earnest. About 73% of shoppers surveyed by marketing platform Omnisend said that Amazon is their go-to source for deals on Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
Amazon's ad business has been finding potential growth opportunities lately.
A recent deal with Netflix will let brands buy ad slots on the streamer through Amazon's own demand-side platform. The move rattled shares of adtech rival The Trade Desk after it was announced.
Amazon is expected to give a capital expenditures update on its earnings call this afternoon. Last quarter, Amazon's capex totaled $31.4 billion, and the company said the figure was ""reasonably representative"" of its quarterly capex rate for the rest of the year. It's largely driven by investments in AWS — particularly AI and tech infrastructure — and Amazon's fulfillment and transportation network.
Capex growth is a hot-button issue across Big Tech. The following chart shows how spending stacks up so far.
Investors will be listening for any details that CEO Andy Jassy and the company offer about Amazon's grocery business in light of a recent reboot.
In June, a memo obtained by Business Insider showed that Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh, and Amazon Go were being united under a single ""One Grocery"" operation eight years after Amazon acquired Whole Foods for $13.7 billion.

The company launched a $5 private-label grocery line earlier this month aimed at luring value hunters away from Walmart and Aldi.
Wedbush has high hopes for the tech giant heading into the call, maintaining a $280 price target, up from its previous target of $250 a share.
The firm's analysts predict that it is poised for a breakout in 2026 and likely to shake off the volatility that has weighed on the stock recently. They expect Amazon to reach $99.6 billion in full-year revenue, and predict Q3 revenue of $20.1 billion.

They also cited several immediate-term catalysts, including savings from automation and robotics progress, and the commercialization of Alexa's new AI capabilities.
Business Insider's Chief Tech Correspondent Eugene Kim and Chief Correspondent Aki Ito will join Deputy Executive Editor Dan DeFrancesco to talk about Amazon's decision this week to lay off 14,000 employees in a livestream at 2 p.m. ET. AI's role in the layoffs will be a key topic.

Amazon said on Tuesday that it would cut 14,000 corporate jobs in one of the biggest rounds of layoffs in the company's history.
It raised a big question for Wall Street: Is the company cutting jobs because growth is stalling, or is the retail giant's big bet on AI making it more efficient? Business Insider's Alistair Barr wrote in Thursday's Tech Memo newsletter that Amazon's latest quarterly earnings report could answer that all-important question.

Revenue growth for Amazon Web Services, the company's crucial cloud business, is the number to watch when Amazon reports this afternoon, Barr wrote.
For the third quarter, Wall Street expects AWS revenue to increase 18% year over year to $32.4 billion, according to Bloomberg.
UBS analysts are feeling optimistic heading into the report, although they anticipate some ""noise"" around operating income due to the company's recent $2.5 billion settlement with the FTC.
The bank recently raised its price target for Amazon stock from $271 to $279, maintaining its Buy rating. While analysts said that they are waiting to see investment proof points from AWS, they still see the area as a likely growth driver for Amazon, as they expect multiple headwinds to wane in the near future.

Investors will want to hear more about AWS's latest AI strategy, including what it's doing to attract new customers.
Early-stage startups are skipping traditional cloud spending and heading straight to model-training tools and niche providers. These companies are Amazon's ""blind spot,"" according to an internal document seen by Business Insider. Amazon has traditionally relied on venture capital firms to find startups that could be new clients.

9,2025-10-30,"Hot off its historic jump to a $4 trillion market cap, Apple delivered an earnings beat after the closing bell — but its struggles in China continue.
While Apple's revenue grew 8% year over year to $102.5 billion, beating estimates, and EPS grew 13% year over year to $1.85, sales in China decreased from the year-ago period, missing estimates.
Apple's cash cow, the iPhone, generated $49.02 billion in revenue, slightly missing Wall Street's estimates of $49.33 billion.
The stock dipped 3% immediately following the results before ticking up 5% after hours.
In a call with analysts, Apple said it planned to increase its capex spending in the holiday quarter, driven by expanding AI investments — a theme in Big Tech earnings this quarter.
""We are increasing our investments in AI while also continuing to invest in our product road map,"" CFO Kevan Parekh said.
CEO Tim Cook said he expected China revenue to return to growth in the holiday quarter, and that a supply constraint drove the 4% year-over-year decline in the region.
Cook said Apple is ""making good progress"" on its overhauled Siri, which has faced delays, and he expects it to launch next year.
The iPhone 17, which had only had about a week of sales recorded in the quarterly numbers released, is ""resonating around the world,"" Cook said.
Looking to the holiday quarter, Apple's CFO said the company expects total revenue to increase 10-12% year over year — higher than Wall Street analysts expected — and iPhone sales to grow double digits. If those growth projections hold, Apple's CFO said it would be ""our best quarter ever."" 
Catch up on what Apple discussed on its earnings call below:

Apple's CFO says AI investments are expected to drive the increase in capex — which is what many other Big Tech companies are saying this earnings cycle.
Apple says it will continue to leverage its hybrid model when it comes to building out its own private cloud compute as well as using third parties.
When asked about its AI foundation model strategy, Cook says that Apple will continue to ""surveil the market"" and is ""open to pursuing M&A if we think that it will advance our road map.""
It's ""too early to call"" the mix of demand for specific iPhone 17 models, Cook says.
""Frankly, we don't really know what the mix will be yet because we have constraints on both sides of the ledger, on the top and on the entry,"" Cook says, referencing the high-end Pro models and the entry-level iPhone 17.
An analyst asks Cook about whether he had concerns about ""search volumes decelerating at the expense of AI"" and how the company thinks about the ""broader sustainability of these very strong mid-teens growth rates for services.""
""The advertising category, which is a combination of third-party and first-party, did set a record during the quarter,"" Cook says.
An analyst asks Cook about whether he had concerns about ""search volumes decelerating at the expense of AI"" and how the company thinks about the ""broader sustainability of these very strong mid-teens growth rates for services.""
""The advertising category, which is a combination of third-party and first-party, did set a record during the quarter,"" Cook says.
Apple doesn't split its own internal advertising and licensing within its ad business. Apple's service category also includes payments from Apple's $20 billion search deal with Apple.
""Sorry, just to be clear, both Apple's internal advertising and within the licensing individually set records?"" the analyst asks in a follow-up.
""I'm not saying that. I'm just saying that the combination of the two set a record we don't,"" Cook says. ""I'm dodging the question intentionally, because we don't split it at that level.""
The ""vast majority"" of Apple's operating expenses are driven by research and development costs, the CFO says.
""We are increasing our investments in AI while also continuing to invest in our product roadmap,"" Parekh says.
That projection is based on ""what we know right now"" and where the tariff policies are currently. It ""assumes a stable environment"" for the current quarter, Cook adds.
It does factor in the recent decrease in the China tariff from 20% down to 10%, Cook says.
Apple expects to return to growth in the Greater China region in its fiscal Q1. Cook says he ""couldn't be more pleased"" with how well the iPhone 17 is being received in Greater China.
Cook says a supply constraint in China ""drove the results"" in the most recent quarter, which saw a 4% year-over-year decline.
Cook says the success of the iPhone this quarter is credited to the ""incredibly"" strong iPhone 17 lineup. Cook maintains that it's the strongest iPhone lineup ever.
""The iPhone Air feels so thin and so light in your hand, it feels like it's going to fly away,"" Cook says about the new form factor.
Apple's CFO gives guidance for the holiday quarter, which is typically Apple's biggest of the year. Here's what Apple expects:
Apple reported roughly $1.1 billion in tariff-related costs in its fiscal Q4, in line with its previous forecast. That's a sizable increase, though, from its $800 million impact in fiscal Q3.
Cook says Apple is continuing its US investment with its Apple Manufacturing Academy in Detroit and the $600 billion investment it promised over the next four years. The areas of growth in the US include advanced manufacturing, silicon engineering, and artificial intelligence, the CEO says.
""These commitments build on our long-standing investments in America, while supporting more than 450,000 jobs with thousands of suppliers across all 50 states,"" Cook says.
Cook shouts out Apple TV shows like ""Severance"" and ""The Studio"" for their contributions to the company's 22 Emmy wins this year. Cook credits ""original storytelling"" for the success of Apple's shows.
""F1 is one of the most exciting and fastest growing sports in the world, and starting next year, Apple TV will be the place for subscribers to follow every twist and turn of the new season,"" Cook says. ""F1 the movie, one of the year's biggest blockbusters, will be coming to Apple TV on December 12.""
Tim Cook says Apple is still working on the more personalized Siri and ""making good progress."" The company expects to release it next year, he says.
The new Siri has been a developmental challenge for Apple, with the company previously making the rare move to publicly delay the rollout.
""As we continue to expand our investment in AI, we're bringing intelligence to more of what people already love about our products and services, making every experience more personal, capable, and effortless,"" Cook says.
Apple CEO Tim Cook kicks off the call with opening remarks on the growth areas and the record highs the company hit in revenues in several categories. Looking ahead to the December holiday quarter, Cook says he expects it to be the ""best"" yet.
Apple CEO Tim Cook and CFO Kevan Parekh are on the call. They'll begin by reading prepared remarks on the quarter and then open it up to a live Q&A with analysts.
China, a key market for Apple sales, continues to be a tough area for the tech giant. In this most recent quarter, revenue was $14.49 billion, down from $15.03 billion in the same period last year.
The miss comes after Apple released the iPhone 17 lineup and the iPhone Air experienced delays in the region — though only about a week of iPhone 17 sales are reflected in Apple's fiscal fourth quarter.
Apple reported over $28.7 billion in services revenue this quarter, up from just under $25 billion in the same quarter last year. Apple CEO Tim Cook said in the earnings press release that this was an ""all-time revenue record for Services.""
""While the market remains fixated on AI adoption and monetization, Apple proves that the old recipe still works,"" Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com, said.
Fourth Quarter
Apple stock closed up 0.63% and was trading slightly up after hours. Amazon, which just released a strong earnings report after the bell, saw its shares soar 10% after hours.
Apple's services business, which includes revenue from iCloud, Apple TV+, and its $20 billion search engine deal with Google, among others, has long been a highlight of Tim Cook's tenure at the helm. Cook has grown areas like Apple TV+ into household names, and the services segment's consistent revenue growth has helped insulate Apple amid turbulence in the US smartphone market.
In fiscal Q3, the company reported a record high of $27.4 billion in services revenue. For this most recent quarter, Wall Street estimates that Apple will surpass that figure with $28.18 billion in revenue.
While Tim Cook has managed to curry favor with President Donald Trump, Apple has still felt the bite of tariffs — $800 million in added costs in its fiscal third quarter, to be precise.
That number was expected to grow considerably in this most recent quarter, with Apple guiding that its tariff-related costs would be around $1.1 billion.

We'll soon see if it managed to mitigate those costs down below that estimate — or whether the impact was worse than anticipated. Analysts will also be eyeing Apple's tariff guidance for next quarter.
With Meta's Ray-Ban AI glasses selling well, Apple is rumored to be exploring its own smart glasses while it continues work to slim down its bulky Vision Pro headset.
When asked about the Vision Pro on Apple's last earnings call, Cook signaled there was more to come.

""We continue to be very focused on it,"" Cook previously said. ""I don't want to get into the road map on it, but this is an area that we really believe in.""
Apple is also reportedly working on some AI home devices, including one with a robot arm, as well as a foldable iPhone expected to launch as soon as 2026. Samsung, Google, and Huawei have already entered the foldable phone space.
Demand for the iPhone 17 lineup appears strong, according to third-party data, with the entry-level 17 and high-end Pro models the early standouts.
Apple's newest iPhone lineup is outperforming last year's models in both the US and China, two of its most important markets, according to data from Counterpoint Research. Sales of the iPhone 17 series were estimated to be 14% higher than those of the iPhone 16 lineup during the first 10 days on the market.

The thin and sleek form factor of the iPhone Air turned heads when it was introduced at Apple's September event.
At 5.6 millimeters — Apple's thinnest iPhone yet — the frame comes with a smaller battery than Pro models and no physical SIM card. To make up for what it lacks in battery life, Apple released an external battery pack alongside the iPhone Air, which costs $99. But Apple's battery-rich Pro models, with top-of-the-line cameras, are typically the company's most popular, and reports have begun to emerge that Apple is cutting back on Air production.

A Keybanc survey of more than 2,000 iPhone owners found weak demand for the Air model compared to the strength of the Pro and Pro Max. Three percent of respondents said they upgraded to the iPhone Air, while 41% went for the iPhone 17 Pro Max.
While Apple's most recent quarter will only include a week or so of sales from the 17 lineup, execs will likely provide some color on how the Air is doing so far.
US shoppers discovered earlier this month that the M5 Vision Pro, a refreshed model, is labeled as being a product of Vietnam. A few creators noted the change online as they unboxed their new Vision Pros. It's the latest example of Apple making changes to its supply chain for US-bound products to mitigate its tariff costs.
The original Vision Pro, with an M2 chip, was manufactured in China ahead of its 2024 release. Around the same time, Apple was exploring ramping up supply chain options outside of China.

Don't be surprised if Tim Cook leans into Apple's work in the US.
Earlier this year, Cook committed to investing $600 billion in US manufacturing amid President Donald Trump's tariff push. In August, Cook presented Trump with a gift, an American-made glass plaque set on a 24-karat gold base.

Cook has proven to be a savvy political navigator — and it appears to be paying off. After receiving the gift, Trump said companies like Apple ""will be treated really well.""
Cook, alongside other tech leaders, joined Trump for a dinner event in September. The Apple CEO addressed the president in a speech, praising his efforts to bring more manufacturing to the US.
Earlier this week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang gave an America-themed presentation during Nvidia's GTC October keynote.
There's an argument to be made that Apple's slow start in AI hasn't hurt it all that much — at least not yet. Yet with all the headlines around its AI talent departing, Apple would do well to reassure the market that big and exciting things are coming. One of those is a long-anticipated overhaul of Siri with Apple Intelligence, touted for next year.
Then there are reports of new home devices and AR glasses — all of which will need good AI. Don't expect Tim Cook to break character and start gossiping about future products, but this would be a good time for a bit of extra candor.
Apple looks like it's in a better position heading into its earnings report than it has been in a year, according to Angelo Zino, a senior equity analyst at CFRA Research.
Zino pointed to how investors now have more clarity relating to Apple's regulatory issues and the potential impact of tariffs.

Zino pointed to how investors now have more clarity relating to Apple's regulatory issues and the potential impact of tariffs.
""Recent comments about tariffs tied to the company from the Trump administration make us feel much more comfortable about the margin outlook ahead,"" he added.
Demand for iPhones also looks solid heading into the print. CFRA said it was ""conservatively"" estimating that iPhone revenue was on track to grow 6% for the current quarter and 5% for the upcoming quarter.
CFRA issued a ""Buy"" rating on Apple and a $280 price target, implying 4% upside from the stock's current levels.
Bank of America has a strong outlook for Apple over the next five years. Analysts pointed to revenues potentially increasing due to AI and its possible impact on coming product offerings.
Analysts also said they saw ""strength"" in new iPhone demand, and estimated that total iPhone unit sales could reach 57 million for the current quarter, compared to consensus estimates of 54 million.

The Hue bridge acts as the main hub for your smart lighting system: It connects your bulbs to your home network and offers features that standard Bluetooth bulbs can’t. This hub creates a special Zigbee network and keeps your smart lights responsive without slowing down your Wi-Fi or hurting connection quality. The bridge also allows for automations: You can set your lights to turn on before you wake up or turn off automatically when you leave home.
The two included A19 bulbs deliver 800 lumens each: This provides brightness similar to traditional 60-watt incandescent bulbs while using much less energy. These White and Color Ambiance bulbs cover a range from warm candlelight tones at around 2000K to cool daylight at 6500K, plus offer access to 16 million colors for fun lighting effects. The E26 base fits standard lamp sockets and ceiling fixtures: You can install them in table lamps, floor lamps, or overhead lights without needing adapters. Dimming is smooth through the app or voice commands, and gives you fine control over brightness levels that wall switches can’t achieve.
Preset scenes take the hassle out of choosing colors: They provide ready-made lighting combinations tailored for different activities and moods. The 24-hour natural light scene mimics the sun’s movement throughout the day. It begins with energizing cool tones in the morning and shifts to calming warm hues as evening approaches. Focus modes provide bright, clear lighting to help you concentrate during work hours, while reading scenes offer comfortable light that reduces eye strain. Relaxation and sleep scenes gradually dim to warm amber tones, signaling to your body that it’s time to unwind.
Voice control with Alexa and Google Assistant lets you adjust your lights without reaching for your phone or getting off the couch. Simple commands like “turn on the living room lights” or “set bedroom to 50 percent” become routine after a few days. The Hue app guides you through setting up voice control with easy instructions that take only a few minutes. You can also create custom voice commands for specific scenes, like saying “movie time” to automatically dim your lights to theater mode.
At $99, this starter kit is an easy way to enter the Philips Hue ecosystem. It provides everything you need to experience smart lighting in two rooms right out of the box.

But the devastating impact of the Category 5 storm on communities is starting to be revealed by satellite imagery.
BBC Verify has been examining the new images to try to piece together what has been destroyed and what has been left standing.
Arguably the most striking impact can be seen in images of the southwestern coastal port of Black River.
We can identify specific buildings that have been battered or in some cases destroyed.
By comparing a satellite image taken on 9 February with one taken on 29 October - after the hurricane hit - you can see that the distinctive white roof of a building housing a market has been replaced by a gaping hole.
A little further north, a café has been wiped off the map.
At the top of the image, the red roof of a warehouse has disappeared.
The outline of the fire station next to the market is still visible but the top of the building appears to have been torn off.
Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness has described Black River as ""ground zero"" after sharing footage of the destruction there.
Photographs of White House, a fishing village on the west coast of Jamaica which is home to several thousand people, reveal how it bore the brunt as Melissa made landfall with winds of up to 185 mph.
Nearly every structure appears to have been damaged or destroyed.
In particular, the buildings next to the beach appear to have razed to the ground.
These include restaurants called Marva's and Pelican Lookout.
The top of a large circular structure is now missing and further inland, along the main road, a cluster of shops has been hit hard.
Fishing boats in the bay - seen in satellite imagery on 7 October - have disappeared.
Part of of Montego Bay - one of Jamaica's most popular tourists destinations - now resemble a brown swamp.
The shore on this section of the northwest coast has been transformed by the flood water which now stains the beach.
Authorities say facilities at the port and industrial park were inundated.
The container terminal, an oil storage facility and nearby water treatment plant were all badly affected, along with a sports complex.
The mayor of Montego Bay, Richard Vernon, has called the place ""devastated"" and added that locals are doing all they can to look after each other.
Montego Bay is a popular destination for cruise ships to dock and home to golf courses as well resorts next to the normally pristine white sand.
The storm has been downgraded from a Category 5 to a Category 2 storm but is gathering speed. 
Sam Johnson, from Bournemouth, last heard from his brother and niece in Jamaica before the hurricane.
The Bailiff of Jersey said he is deeply saddened to learn of the extensive damage in Jamaica.
Londoners with family in Jamaica await updates in the aftermath of the strongest storm to hit the island.
The hurricane - Jamaica's worst to date - was downgraded from a category five storm on Wednesday.

You know how Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, is spending $72 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025? Well, with his companyâs stock in the middle of a vertigo-inducing plunge of about 8% on Wednesday afternoonâa signal that investors are getting worriedâCEO Mark Zuckerberg conjured a vision of a world where Meta doesnât end up using all that stuff for its intended purpose in the near future, saying it would be fine. That infrastructure Meta is investing in is intended to come in handy if AI superintelligence is achieved soon, Zuckerberg said on an earnings call Wednesday. âIf it takes longer, then weâll use the extra compute to accelerate our core business, which continues to be able to profitably use much of the compute,â Zuckerberg said, according to The Wall Street Journal. Metaâs âcore businessâ remains ad-subsidized social media apps. Advertising accounts for almost all of its revenue, according to its own financial disclosures from earlier this year. Itâs not as though Meta has not deployed AI in its social media apps. (Who can forget the tragic case of âBig sis Billieâ?) But the basic functions of Metaâs platforms have not exactly been revolutionized by AI, unless you count all those people who now post things like Shrimp Jesus on Facebook. With that in mind, might billions of dollars spent on data center construction, expensive AI experts, and an entire GPU company be overkill, assuming it’s just to “accelerate” Facebook and Instagram?And those AI expenses arenât about to shrink next year. Zuckerberg also told investors to expect 2026 to be even spendier than 2025. âI think itâs the right strategy to aggressively front-load building capacity,â he said, according to the Journal â.That way, if superintelligence arrives sooner, we will be ideally positioned for a generational paradigm shift in many large opportunities.âThe worst case scenario for Meta, Mark Zuckerberg says, is that it might have to âslow building new infrastructure for some period while we grow into what we build.âGizmodo reached out to Meta for comment, and will update if we hear back.

The data center industry is the backbone of the AI business, and the AI business, as we all know, is where the money’s at these days. As AI becomes the unstable center of America’s weird new economy, the infrastructure necessary to keep the AI going and the money flowing has become all-important, and that’s exactly why Microsoft now appears poised to go on a data-center-building rampage.
During Wednesday’s earnings call, Microsoft’s CEO, Satya Nadella, told investors that the company plans to double its data center footprint over the next two years, the Wall Street Journal reports. At the same time, Nadella said that his company would “boost its AI capacity by more than 80% this year,” the newspaper writes.
According to its earnings report released Wednesday, the company’s revenue during the first fiscal quarter of 2026 was $77.7 billionâan 18 percent increase from where it was last year at this time. Its operating income, meanwhile, was $38.0 billion, which is a 24 percent increase from this time last year.
It seems like further proof that, while studies seem to show that most businesses that are rolling out AI programs aren’t really profiting from them, somebody is still getting paid. Indeed, the AI boom has been majorly profitable for big fish like Microsoft because everyone and their mother now wants to start an AI-centric business and, to make AI work, you need cloud. It’s previously been noted that other Big Tech giantsâlike Google and Amazonâare also capitalizing on the current frenzy to suck up vast amounts of computing real estate, so to speak.
If Microsoft is making big bucks from Azure, it’s no wonder it wants to expand it. Azure already lays claim to some 400 data centers in 70 regions around the world. For a time, Microsoft was also the exclusive cloud provider to its special business partner, OpenAI. However, it lost that privilege in January, as OpenAI sought to diversify its cloud relationships. During Wednesday’s earnings call, Nadella reportedly said that his company’s relationship with OpenAI was âone of the most successful partnerships and investments our industry has even seenâ and that the two companies would “continue to benefit mutually from each otherâs growth across multiple dimensions.â
Despite the big uptick in revenue, Microsoft’s stock still dropped 4 percent today, upon the news that the company planned to spend more in the coming year on its AI business, CNBC reports. To continue the AI-ification of the economy, companies will still need to invest.

16,2025-10-30,"When Microsoft decided they wanted to get into the game console market, they were faced with a problem. Everyone knew them as a company that developed computer software, and there was a concern that consumers wouldn’t understand that their new Xbox console was a separate product from their software division. To make sure they got the message though, Microsoft decided to show off a prototype that nobody could mistake for a desktop computer.
The giant gleaming X that shared the stage with Bill Gates and Seamus Blackley at the 2000 Game Developers Conference became the stuff of legend. We now know the machine wasn’t actually a working Xbox, but at the time, it generated enormous buzz. But could it have been a functional console? That’s what [Tito] of Macho Nacho Productions wanted to find out — and the results are nothing short of spectacular.

The key to this project is the enclosure itself, but this is no simple project box we’re talking about here. Milled from a solid block of aluminum, the original prototype’s shell reportedly cost Microsoft $18,000 to have produced, which would be around $36,000 when adjusted for inflation. Luckily, the state of the art has moved forward a bit in the intervening two decades. So after working with [Wesk] to create a 3D model from reference images (including some that [Tito] took himself of one of the surviving prototypes on display in New York), the design was sent away to PCBWay for production. It still cost the better part of $6 K to be produced, but that’s a hell of a savings compared to the original. Though [Tito] still had to polish the aluminum himself to recreate the original’s mirror-like shine.
To say the rest of the project was “easy” would be something of an understatement, but it was at least more familiar territory. Unlike the original prototype, this machine would actually play Xbox games, to [Tito] focused on cramming the original era-appropriate hardware (plus a few modern homebrew tweaks, such as HDMI-out) into the hollow X using a clever system of integrated rails and 3D printed mounts.
Some of the original parts, like the power supply, were simply too large to use. That’s where [Redherring32] came in. He designed a custom USB-C power supply that could satisfy the original console’s energy needs in a much smaller footprint. There’s also a modern SSD in place of the 8 GB of spinning rust that the console shipped with back in 2001. But overall, it’s still real Xbox hardware — no emulation or other funny tricks here.
At this point, the team had already exceeded what Microsoft pulled off in 2000, but they weren’t done yet. Wanting to really set this project apart, [Tito] decided to replace the center jewel with something a bit more modern. The original was little more than a backlit piece of plastic, but on this build it’s a circular LCD driven by a Raspberry Pi Pico, capable of showing a number of custom full-motion animations thanks to the efforts of [StuckPixel].
The end result of this team effort is a machine that’s not only better looking than Microsoft’s original, but also more functional. It’s a project that’s destined for a more than just sitting on a shelf collecting dust, so we’re happy to hear that [Tito] plans on taking it on a tour of different gaming events to give the public a chance to see it in person. He’s even had a custom crate made so he can transport it around in style and safety.

Beautiful! Really detailed work. A tip of the hat to all concerned.
Idle speculation… how close was the original Xbox motherboard form-factor to standard (ITX or microATX)? I wonder if the enclosure could be repurposed in due course to accept a more modern board, perhaps then running XEmu or MAME…?
It’s not at all close other than being a rectangle  sure you can do it pretty sure people have but its not a drop in clear some holes affair
Nirvana’s single “X-shaped box” didn’t A/B test very well, so they changed the name.
$18k ea. was for the whole functional prototypes, not just the shell.
A billet of aluminum that size would be about 80 kg, costing about $200 at the time.  Milling it would cost $$$, or even $$$$, but certainly not $$$$$
I love The Duke style controller still to this day. I know I’m in the minority, but it fit my hands so well.

ETH price fell 3% despite the Federal Reserve’s 25 bps rate cut and announcement to end quantitative tightening, as bears get an upper hand. 
The FOMC meeting and Fed rate cut announcement on October 29 turned out to be a “sell-the-news” scenario for the crypto market.
Ethereum     

ETH
$3 784



24h volatility:
4.9%


Market cap:
$456.79 B



Vol. 24h:
$41.56 B



	 price has lost the $4,000 support, dropping another 3% in the last 24 hours, in what analysts believe to be a classic bear trap. On the other hand, spot Ethereum ETF flows have turned negative again.




After trying hard to hold the ETH price above $4,000, bulls have once again given up to the bearish pressure as the largest altcoin falls 3% today.
Coinglass data also shows that the ETH futures open interest dropped 2.7% to $46 billion.
Crypto analyst Ted Pillows noted that ETH price has once again fallen below the key $4,000 support level, even after several major macroeconomic developments that were expected to boost market sentiment.
https://twitter.com/TedPillows/status/1983812477646467081
In the last 24 hours, there have been some major macro developments, such as the 25 bps Fed rate cut, the Fed’s decision to end quantitative tightening (QT) and shrink its balance sheet by December 1, and renewed U.S.-China trade talks.
The analyst suggested two possibilities: “Either this is a classic bear trap, or the crypto market is headed significantly lower.”
Although Ethereum has been facing significant volatility recently, another market analyst, IncomeSharks, noted that it must hold above $4,000 to keep the bull momentum intact.
However, according to the chart shared by the analyst, if ETH falls below this level, it could decline toward the lower band near $2,200, as shown below.
https://twitter.com/IncomeSharks/status/1983628001712730186
The spot Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. saw their flows flip to the negative territory after strong inflows for the first two days. The total flows on October 29 were a negative $84 million.
Fidelity’s FETH contributed to the most outflows at $69.5 million, followed by Grayscale’s ETH at $16.2 million.
On the contrary, BlackRock’s ETHA saw positive inflows at $21.4 million, as per data from Farside Investors.

It’s not a particularly good time to be a (human) worker in America. Tens of thousands of people have been laid off over the past several days, and the general outlook for job-seekers appears grim, to say the least. This week, Amazon announced plans to neutralize some 14,000 positions, while Meta said it would purge several hundred people from various offices throughout California and Washington state. Chegg, the online learning platform, announced plans to reduce its workforce by a whopping 45 percent on Monday. Several other large American companiesâincluding FedEx, Paramount, General Motors, Target, and UPSâsimilarly announced plans to eliminate jobs.
The consensus seems to be that this sudden employment blood bath may just be the birthing pangs of the new AI ageâa time in which jobs are no longer an indicator of economic success, I guess. Headlines about the layoffs have routinely included AI as a factor, a trend encouraged by the companies themselves. Indeed, in Amazon’s announcement about its new downsizing, the company’s executive, Beth Galetti, cited AI, noting that the company needs to be “organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” Similarly, in its layoffs announcement, Chegg cited the “new realities of AI” as a factor.
But is it really AI’s fault, or is it just the case that the American economy is currently riding a one-way ticket to the trash heap? Is an AI-ified economy one with fewer jobs? Or does a bad economy just mean more AI? Or are the companies suffering from other ailments and simply leaning into the AI narrative for cover?
NBC News recently interviewed an economic scholar who seemed skeptical of the narrative surrounding job loss and AI. âItâs much easier for a company to say, âWe are laying workers off because weâre realizing AI-related efficienciesâ than to say âWeâre laying people off because weâre not that profitable or bloated, or facing a slowing economic environment, etc,ââ David Autor, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said. âWhether or not AI were the reason, youâd be wise to attribute the credit/blame to AI,â he added.
BBC, meanwhile, recently interviewed Martha Gimbel, executive director of the Budget Lab at Yale University, who felt that the AI talk was overblown. “A lot of this conversation feels very different to people because the phrase AI is in it,” Gimbel told the outlet. “But so far, nothing that I’ve seen looks different than typical patterns of companies hiring and firing, particularly at this point in an economic cycle.”
In other words, companies may be simply saving face by pretending that losing team members and downsizing is really just part of a glorious pivot towards “leaner,” “more efficient” automation. In reality, these companies may be hurting and may be taking advantage of the current narrative around AI to spin that hurt into PR gold.
If you’re a large company, you’d be forgiven for not feeling your best these days. Indeed, the indicators for the U.S. economy right now are, in a word, bad. Conveniently for Trump, the U.S. government continues to be shut down, which means that the organizations that would traditionally monitor and report on the nation’s economic health (like the Fed) are unable to do their jobs. However, even without official government analysis, financial experts are expressing skepticism about the health of the economy.
For instance, Morningstar, a financial services firm that specializes in economic analysis, recently noted that U.S. GDP growth in the first half of 2025 was lower than in previous years, and that this growth slump is expected to continue for the foreseeable future, with consumers becoming more and more cautious about spending. Additionally, consumer sentiment and the strength of the labor market have both been weakening, the report says, citing the most recent job growth data provided by the government:
There are multiple ways to look at the health of the US labor market, which is tied to the overall health of the economy. Job growth is a primary indicator…The US economyÂ added just 22,000 jobs in AugustÂ as unemployment continued to rise. That number is well below what economists had previously expected and the 79,000 reported in July. The revised June numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that the US economy lost 13,000 jobs in June.
The report also notes that inflation has continued to stick around, and the price of goods has shot up “in response to tariffs, as producers started passing along higher import prices.”
In short, due to the Trump administration’s bizarre policies, there is a lot of economic uncertainty right now, and uncertainty, as we all know, isn’t great for markets. As an example, next month, the Supreme Court is set to rule on whether Trump’s tariffsâwhich have been challenged by lawsuitsâare legal or not. If they prove to be illegal, the Trump administration may have to facilitate the repayment of all of the revenue generated by those tariffs, which would be logistically insane and a hugely disruptive process for the federal government. As we all know, uncertainty is, itself, not great for an economy, since, to confidently maneuver and make money, businesses need to know that they can put one foot in front of the other without falling down a manhole.
So are layoffs happening because more companies are adopting AI or because the economy is doing poorly? Or for some other reason? From the outside, it’s impossible to tell, but suffice it to say, there is definitely more than one possible explanation for why companies are currently shedding jobs like nobody’s business. The situation may be more mundane

Bitcoin plunged over 4% on Thursday, falling as low as $106,290, as crypto traders reacted to signals from both the Federal Reserve and President Donald Trump. In short, crypto world seems nervous about the future.
Bitcoin hit a record high of $125,245 on Oct. 5, prompting many crypto optimists to make wild predictions that it could just continue to go up forever. But that line of thinking hasn’t worked out in recent weeks, especially after a flash crash two weeks ago that wiped out billions.
The Federal Reserve announced interest rate cuts Wednesday, setting the benchmark short term rate between 3.75% and 4%, which the Wall Street Journal notes is the lowest in three years. That’s exactly what President Donald Trump had been asking for, as he’s pestered Powell to lower interest rates ever since the president’s second term started back in January.
Traders liked the cuts, but Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell made some on Wall Street uneasy when he signaled that another rate cut was no guarantee when the Fed met again in December. “Far from it,” Powell said.
President Trump’s meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping also weighed on crypto sentiment Thursday. Trump announced that tariffs on goods coming to the U.S. from China would be lowered, but they’re coming down just 10% from 57% to 47%.
Trump has been seen by the crypto community as a positive force, making radical changes that have included scrapping the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET) at the Department of Justice which investigates crypto-related crimes. Typically, any market with honest brokers likes to have a cop on the beat to keep things fair and catch bad actors. But Trump is operating from a different perspective, allowing bad actors to flourish under an operating theory that might be known as “who gives a fuck, get yours.”
Trump has also pardoned high-profile people convicted of crypto-related crimes, including Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht and most recently Binance founder Changpeng Zhao. While Zhao had already served his prison sentence, the pardon means that he probably won’t need to pay the $50 million he owes in restitution.
Bitcoin’s price has recovered somewhat since its low for the day, bouncing back to $107,900 at the time of this writing. But that’s still down over 5% from where it was a month ago. Compared over a longer period of time, it certainly looks better. A year ago, bitcoin was trading at $68,500, a period just before the 2024 presidential election.
Other cryptocurrencies also plunged Thursday, with Ethereum down 4.3%, BNB down 4%, XRP down 6.7%, and SolanaÂ  down 6.3%.

Whatever it is, it seems like a lot.
In the above post, I meant to say ""$399 in rupees"" not ""$399 rupees"".
Per mentioned 18 months that would cost otherwise $399.

Boasting the rodeo-ready title of the largest Western retailer in the United States, Boot Barn beat Wall Street expectations in its quarterly earnings report on Wednesday.
The company reported a net sales of $505.4 million, a 18.7% increase from a year prior. Boot Barn's share price has increased by more than 50% over the past 12 months, and is up over 27% year-to-date.
Boot Barn, which operates nearly 500 stores, said it conducted a market analysis that determined its total addressable market is bigger than previously believed, at an estimated $58 billion. Its TAM was previously thought to be $40 billion.
""We now also believe we can operate 1,200 stores across the United States, an increase from our prior estimate of 900, which is more than double our current footprint,"" CEO John Hazen said. ""We are confident in our ability to capitalize on this expanded market opportunity while continuing to deliver strong returns for our stockholders.""
Hazen said during the call that while the company had seen strength across its main categories of western apparel and boots for men and women, the company's denim segment has become a draw in and of itself. 
""We really have become more of a denim destination,"" Hazen said.
Western wear has experienced a resurgence in recent years, driven in part by the popularity of the show ""Yellowstone"" and major pop culture events, like Beyoncé's ""Cowboy Carter"" album and tour.
While some American retailers experienced a slowdown this year, driven in part by tariffs, Boot Barn said it's seen sales growth both online and in-store.
""As I look at the top 10 styles in women's denim or men's denim, it is almost exclusively bootcut jeans,"" Hazen added, noting that its customers are seeking out the ""traditional silhouette.""
Christopher Nardone, an analyst with Bank of America who was on the call, asked if Boot Barn was seeing emerging competition in the Western category, given its popularity.
CFO Jim Watkins said that when Western boots, especially women's, are more in style, some of the mainstream brands will sell them, at least temporarily, but that they ""haven't really seen any significant, sizable entrants into the market.""

Cluely [is] a tool to help software engineers cheat on their job interviews, among other use cases...use Cluely to impress a woman on a date, which went viral.
I suspect the Trump Administration is using Cluely to guide policy.
In my experience, your VC people ""strongly advise"" you to get some marketing people and will yell at you if you're doing it wrong.
most startups flop because they fail to get seen, even if they have product-market fit
Couldn't a savvy investor contact the producer of otherwise good products that are not getting traction, and ask for an ownership percent if they market it for them?
By waiting until after the product is clearly flopping, the investor can get a better deal (bigger slice) since the producer no longer has many options for the product.
He's right. Up until reading this summary, I've never seen or heard anyone mention ""Cluely"" - whatever it is - in any context at all.
And all I can say is WHAT THE FUCK are they talking about?!?
It's just some asshat trying to devalue engineering. You don't hire engineers to make viral slop so complaining about engineers not being good at making viral slop will make sure you don't retain engineers good at engineering.
That's not what he's saying at all. He's saying engineers are shitty at marketing.

There's a cliche in SV about that - ""First time founders talk product. Second time founders talk distro.""


The best product in the world will fail if nobody knows it exists, and depending on who the market is, it can be very hard to get the attention of possible customers. If you're mass-market, well, look at all that noise you need to cut through. If you're some niche enterprise product, identifying customers is easier, but getting their attention is hard, and building enough trust as a new entrant to take a risk on is much harder.


So you need to attract or buy attention, or hire someone who can. And frequently that means making deals with intermediaries, matchmakers, etc.


Dude still sounds insufferable.
I've been in two diffeeent computer science programs. Both required at least one course in ethics, specifically related to computer science.

Tesla rival Polestar has shut down its two R&D sites in the UK and laid off 130 staff, Business Insider has learned.
Staff at the Swedish EV maker were notified earlier this month that its R&D efforts would shift from Nuneaton and Coventry in England to its headquarters in Sweden, three sources told Business Insider. The redundancy process is expected to finish by the end of the year, they added.
A Polestar spokesperson confirmed the layoffs to Business Insider.
In an emailed statement, the spokesperson said it no longer requires the R&D capacity in the UK now that the engineering work for the Polestar 5, its upcoming model, is complete.
They added that it was centralizing its R&D work at its headquarters in Sweden.
""With a leaner organisational set-up, our focus remains on developing the best performance EVs on the market,"" the spokesperson said, adding that its focus was on supporting those affected by the cuts.
Polestar, which employs 2,100 people globally, has increasingly shifted its focus to Europe as US tariffs have rocked the global auto industry. The Nasdaq-listed company is majority-owned by the Chinese conglomerate Geely, which owns Volvo Cars and Lotus.
Polestar sold a record 2,758 vehicles in the UK last month. However, the luxury carmaker is burning through cash, reporting a net loss of $1.03 billion in the second quarter of 2025.
Its sales also lag behind Tesla. There were just under 8,000 new Tesla registrations in the UK over the same period, according to data from SMMT.
In January 2024, Polestar announced plans to cut 450 jobs globally, which was equivalent to about 15% of its workforce.

    It's cheaper than other so-called ""affordable"" EVs and fixes the weaknesses of its predecessor.
  
This is what the 2027 Chevrolet Bolt would look like in your driveway -- not a bad-looking car for less than $30,000.
The new Chevrolet Bolt feels like the kind of electric car the market has been waiting for: an EV that's genuinely affordable but doesn't make any major compromises. Starting at $28,995, it brings electric driving back into reach for regular buyers. 
But it's not just about the price: The second-generation Bolt looks to fix the weaknesses of its predecessor while doubling down on practicality and smart technology, aiming to appeal to drivers who want something efficient and approachable without paying top prices. It's worth noting that Tesla's new affordable models start at almost $10,000 more. 
The Chevy Bolt also launches at a time during which electric vehicle shoppers will be looking for cheaper options. According to June figures from Kelley Blue Book, the average new vehicle transaction price in the US sits at $48,644. That's 2% lower than the market peak in December 2023, but it's still about 13% more than prices in June 2021.

An up close and personal look at the 2027 Chevrolet Bolt in this striking blue color.
This car is impressive for a sub-$30,000 EV. Its power comes from a 65-kilowatt-hour lithium-iron-phosphate battery pack, which Chevrolet says is good for 255 miles on a full charge. That's a modest boost over the last Bolt EV and enough for most daily use, especially when paired with charging that's now genuinely fast -- up to 150 kilowatts, with a top-up from 10% to 80% in just 26 minutes. 
Chevrolet includes a CCS adapter for older chargers, and there's a native NACS port, meaning Tesla Supercharger access is built in from Day 1. The Bolt's new bidirectional charging setup allows it to output up to 9.6 kilowatts of power, letting owners feed electricity back into their homes during outages or peak hours. 
Performance should feel lively, too. The front-wheel-drive setup puts out 210 horsepower, while regenerative braking can be adjusted between low, high or blended modes for a more tailored feel behind the wheel. The Bolt still leans on practicality, offering 16 cubic feet of cargo space with the rear seats up and up to 57 cubic feet when folded. That makes it a good fit for small families or city drivers who occasionally need more room (though an SUV it most certainly is not). 
Inside, Chevrolet has modernized the experience with an 11.3-inch touchscreen and an 11-inch digital gauge cluster. The big omission is Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, which GM has decided to drop in favor of a native infotainment system with built-in connectivity. A 2023 McKinsey study revealed that roughly 50% of car buyers in the US would not consider a car without Apple CarPlay -- so this feels like a big miss from General Motors. 
Optional Super Cruise hands-free driving brings semi-autonomous highway capability, including lane changes, route following and automatic merging between interchanges. These features were once reserved for much more expensive EVs, but are now appearing in more affordable vehicles -- a win for car shoppers. 
Chevrolet is offering the car in three trims: The base LT at $28,995, an LT Comfort at $29,990 and the sportier RS trim for about $32,000. Deliveries will begin in the US in early 2026, with all models built at GM's Fairfax, Kansas, plant. At a time when many electric cars still cost well north of $40,000, this one might just prove that the affordable EV isn't dead after all.

                Store manager Jose Pajares says he's slashing prices and stocking less food since business has slowed down at the Save A Lot in Springfield, Mass. The bulk of their customers depend on SNAP benefits, and the store depends on their business. A lapse in funding would hurt everyone.

SPRINGFIELD, Mass. — Theresa Rios came to the grocery store this week with a shorter shopping list than usual. And she's also paying even more attention than usual to price.
Walking past a shelf of items labeled ""Real Bacon Bits"" next to packages of imitation bacon bits, Rios doesn't hesitate. ""This is $2.19 and this is $1.59,"" she says, ""so I'm going to buy this.""
Rios is a regular at the Save A Lot store in Springfield. But since she started hearing that her federal food assistance might soon be cut off, she has been trying to put some of the money she receives aside, just in case. And, she's no longer giving all her business to Save A Lot.
""I'm at the point where I am shopping for deals at three different stores,"" she says. ""So I'll come here because this is cheaper than Stop & Shop, but some of the items at Price Rite are cheaper than here, and Walmart is [cheaper for] the cleaning stuff … I just shop around.""

                Like many worried about a possible cut off in SNAP food aid, Theresa Rios is reducing her spending and doing more of her shopping at retail giants like Walmart hoping to stretch her dollars. Some smaller grocery stores in low-income communities are already seeing their sales slump and bracing for it to get worse.

Rios says she's also forgoing some items altogether, as she has switched to new, cheaper meals for herself and her three young grandchildren, who she takes care of full time. Dinner is downgraded to rice and beans, and she is no longer buying the kids' favorite cereal.
""They'll have to settle for what I can give them,"" she says.
Rios is hardly the only shopper forced to be more frugal. Some 42 million Americans rely on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, formerly known as food stamps, and as many of them worry about losing their food aid, some grocery businesses are increasingly concerned as well. There are 250,000 retailers authorized to accept SNAP benefits. Most would be able to absorb whatever loss that might come from a lapse in SNAP, but others, like the Springfield Save A Lot, are more vulnerable. SNAP purchases at this store make up a solid 65% of sales.
Already, manager Jose Pajares says those sales have started to dry up.
""It's scary,"" he says. ""I see less customers every day because they're afraid to spend all the money they have for the whole month.""
As a result, Pajares says he's been ordering less stock for the store, and he's dropping prices to try to boost sales. But he still ends up with meat and produce languishing on the shelf until its expiration date.
""If we don't sell we have to throw it out,"" he says. ""Every day, we throw things away.""

                The entrance door of the Save A Lot grocery store in Springfield, Mass., features a sign that notes that the store accepts benefits from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, also known as WIC.

Even in the best of times, grocery profit margins are razor thin — usually just a penny or two on the dollar. And recent challenges around tariffs, for example, have sliced profits even thinner.
Anthony Peña, who owns this store, also owns a few others that are less dependent on SNAP business. That means he's able to weather a dip in sales for a bit, he says, but not for long.
""After one, maybe two months, I'll start to think about the nuclear options, as we call it, having to think about closing the store,"" Peña says.
""For small supermarket grocers, challenges like SNAP reductions can have a significant impact on profitability, which unfortunately can put some stores and lots of jobs in jeopardy,"" says Scott Moses, an investment banker with Solomon Partners who wrote the book A 'Grocery' Christmas Carol about the rapid and seismic changes in the grocery industry.

He says a prolonged SNAP shutdown could mean more pressure on the already shrinking number of small independent supermarkets, which are being squeezed by grocery giants like Walmart. By itself, Walmart has almost as much market share as all the nation's 26,000 small supermarket grocers combined.
Now, Moses says, Walmart might well gain even more; if there is a cutoff of SNAP benefits, he says the superstore would likely draw in more new customers.
""A significant amount of customers are going to trade down to what they perceive to be lower-priced operators, and net, net, Walmart will likely come out ahead,"" Moses says.
For the less fortunate stores, however, there is growing concern that any closures could have broad and serious repercussions.
""There's a ripple effect that's going to happen here,"" says Jerome Bouyer, vice president of retail operations for Save A Lot. For starters, Save A Lot stores tend to be ""in places that are already 'food deserts' and have food insecurity. That just makes the problem that much worse.""
There is also worry about the impact on local vendors, suppliers and distributors.
""For example, the bread guy or the guy who delivers eggs or milk to the store,"" Peña says. ""Instead of delivering 100 units, now he's going to deliver 25 units — 75 units less. So that's when things get a little bit more complicated.""

                Cashier Stephanie Hernández is bracing for what could be a double blow. If SNAP food assistance is cut off, business at Save A Lot could crater and she could be laid off. But she is also a SNAP recipient herself, so she could end up losing her food assistance as well as her job.

And of course, store employees are acutely aware that their jobs are also on the line. Already, there are cashiers just standing around during what is supposed to be the busiest shopping hour of the day.
""I'm worried because if customers aren't coming because they don't get food stamps, our jobs are at risk,"" cashier Stephanie Hernández says in Spanish. She has an 11-year-old and twin 1-year-olds. ""If I don't work,"" she says, ""how will I pay my bills?""
If the worst-case scenario does come to pass, it would be a double blow for Hernandez. She gets SNAP benefits herself. So if payments are allowed to lapse, she could end up losing her food assistance — and her job.

Broadcom stock (NASDAQ: AVGO) has soared 13% in a week, driven by significant momentum in the AI sector. This surge is fueled by two major catalysts:
Given this dramatic 13% increase, it is a fundamental part of a robust investment strategy to re-evaluate the stock’s position. Below is a comparison of Broadcom against its peers, focusing on key financial metrics such as size, valuation, growth, and margin. 
For some context, Broadcom delivers semiconductor devices and infrastructure software, which includes set-top box system-on-chips, cable, DSL, and passive optical networking solutions.
That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like AVGO, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
Why does this matter? AVGO recently rose by 17% in a month – a peer comparison places stock performance, valuation, and financials in a broader context – indicating whether it is genuinely outperforming, lagging behind, and ultimately – can this trend continue? Read Buy or Sell AVGO Stock to determine if Broadcom stands as a solid investment. Additionally, there is always a possibility of a decline following a significant rally – observe how the stock has historically dipped and recovered through AVGO Dip Buyer Analysis perspective.
Investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics."

Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) saw contrasting stock reactions following their third-quarter earnings reports, despite both being key AI plays.
Google stock rose 8% in extended trading, driven by a solid Q3 performance. The company reported revenue of $102.4 billion for the three months ended September 30, surpassing Wall Street expectations of $99.85 billion. This sales growth was significantly boosted by Google Cloud, which saw a 34% revenue jump to $15.2 billion. Furthermore, adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.87 well exceeded both the projected $2.27 and the year-ago EPS of $2.12.
Conversely, Meta Platforms' stock dropped 8% in extended trading hours following its downbeat results. Meta reported Q3 revenue of $51.24 billion and EPS of $1.05. While the revenue slightly topped the $49.6 billion expectation, the EPS was a significant miss compared to the projected $6.72, a shortfall largely attributed to a one-time, tax-related charge. The pre-earnings investor interest and subsequent stock decline might also reflect profit-taking.
Despite Google’s strong quarter, we favor Meta. Our preference is based on Meta’s stronger underlying revenue growth performance over key periods, its better operating margins, and a relatively lower valuation compared to Google. The current pre-market stock pullback also offers a more attractive entry point for investors. Consider the data below:
That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like META or GOOGL, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
But do these numbers tell the full story? Read Buy or Sell GOOGL Stock to see if Alphabet's edge holds up under the hood or if Meta Platforms still has cards to play (see Buy or Sell META Stock).
No matter how good the numbers, stock investment is never a smooth ride. There is a risk you must factor in. Read META Dip Buyer Analyses to see how the stock has fallen and recovered in the past.
Remember, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors.

30,2025-10-30,"It is a question that successive governments have struggled with: what kind of threat does China really pose to the UK?
Trying to answer it may have contributed to the high-profile collapse of the case in which two British men, Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry, were accused of spying for China and charged under the Official Secrets Act. 
Both deny wrongdoing - but when charges were dropped last month, it sparked political outcry.
Prosecutors and officials have since offered conflicting accounts about whether a failure or unwillingness to label China as an active threat to national security led to the withdrawal of the charges. And yesterday Lord Hermer, the attorney general, blamed ""out of date"" legislation for the case's collapse.
But this all raises the question of what exactly Chinese espionage looks like in the modern world.
On one level, China spies within the traditional framework of the old ways of human espionage associated with the Cold War, with spies working under the cover of being diplomats, and recruiting people to pass secrets.
The witness statement by a deputy national security adviser for prosecutors investigating the now-collapsed case of Cash and Berry outlines this kind of work. 
""The Chinese Intelligence Services are interested in acquiring information from a number of sources, including policymakers, government staff and democratic institutions and are able to act opportunistically to gather all information they can.""
Here is the thing though. Pretty much every country does this kind of spying - wanting insight into what other countries are up to is as old as the hills. The UK conducts this kind of espionage against China (as China itself has publicly complained about). When countries get caught there is normally a public row but each side knows it is normal business.
But this barely covers the breadth of the Chinese behaviour that worries security officials.
""Try not to think too much just in terms of classic card-carrying spies based out of the embassy in the John le Carre mould,"" the head of MI5 Sir Ken McCallum said during a briefing on national security threats earlier this month.
For what truly sets China apart - and what lies at the heart of the problem - is that the national security threats China poses go beyond traditional notions of espionage. 
To complicate matters further, some of the threats are also closely tied up with the reasons many believe we need to engage with China.
China's economic power, for example, presents many potential benefits for a UK desperate for growth. 
Labour is reported to be seeking to improve ties with China. However, securing the benefits of a relationship while navigating the associated risks is the hard task that has bedevilled governments.
The sheer size of Chinese intelligence – which some estimates put at half a million when you account for the entire workforce operating on security both at home and abroad – means they can afford to pursue their work at a larger scale than many other countries.
Every country uses its intelligence services differently - how it does so throws a spotlight on the priorities of the state - and in China, the top priority is ensuring the continued rule of the Communist Party. 
In practice this has meant influencing political debate abroad, going after dissidents, collecting data at a large scale and ensuring economic growth at home.
In the UK, concerns about Chinese political influence have been growing.
MI5 issued an ""interference alert"" in January 2022 about the activities of an alleged Chinese agent, Christine Lee, who was believed to have infiltrated Parliament.
Ms Lee denied the allegations. She later took unsuccessful legal action against MI5, and told a tribunal that the spy agency's alert about her carried a ""political purpose"".
MI5 has also warned that Beijing was cultivating local politicians in the early stages of their career with the hope of seeding them into more senior positions - a sign of a long-term, patient strategy to build influence.
Here, the purpose was not stealing secrets or gaining information so much as manipulating political debate – having people in influential positions who will take a pro-China view of issues and the world.
Another area that worries UK security officials is China's predilection for spying on dissidents, known as transnational repression, something that has been a primary target for Chinese intelligence for years with a focus on groups like Tibetan campaigners.
But the arrival in the UK of many young pro-democracy activists from Hong Kong, following Beijing's clampdown, has heightened the concerns.
According to MI5, Hong Kong police have issued bounties against more than a dozen pro-democracy activists here in the UK and there have been increased reports of harassment and surveillance.
Beijing has always dismissed accusations of espionage as attempts to ""smear"" China. 
""China never interferes in other countries' internal affairs and always acts in an open and aboveboard manner,"" the Chinese embassy in London has previously said.
In a statement issued earlier this month, it added: ""The so-called 'China spy-case' hyped up by the UK is entirely fabricated and self-staged. China strongly condemns this...
""China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat to any country. We firmly oppose attempts to smear China by peddling unfounded allegations of 'spying activities, or concocting the so-called 'China threat'.""
Yet China has been linked to some large scale cyber operations. Some of this sits within modern notions of espionage – stealing secrets.
Last year Beijing was accused of trying to hack into the emails of MPs.
""China represents an economic threat to our security and an epoch-defining challenge,"" Rishi Sunak, the then-prime minister, said at the time, while avoiding formally labelling Beijing as a ""threat"".
Then, in August, the UK finally revealed what many suspected – that it had been hit as part of a highly sophisticated espionage campaign codenamed Salt Typhoon, which compromised telecoms companies around the world. 
The UK remained quiet about who exactly was hit and only spoke out in conjunction with a dozen other countries and after months of discussion behind the scenes about what it should say.
""The data stolen through this activity can ultimately provide the Chinese intelligence services the capability to identify and track targets' communications and movements worldwide,"" the UK's National Cyber Security Centre, an arm of GCHQ, warned in a statement.
The US had spoken out months earlier, and there it has been reported that senior politicians, including Donald Trump and JD Vance, had their communications targeted during the 2024 election.
Now, in the UK, plans for a new Chinese Embassy at the former Royal Mint building in London have drawn attention for fears that it could offer the chance for espionage by tapping data cables which run underground beneath it.
But some security officials downplay those dangers - not only because those cables can be physically protected and monitored - but because of Beijing's capacity for large cyber-espionage. 
The reality is that it has shown itself perfectly capable of collecting data through remote cyber-access.
That kind of targeting, though, still sits broadly within traditional state-on-state espionage and the kind of thing Western governments carry out. 
In fact it was the revelations about the scale of UK and US digital eavesdropping by former contractor Edward Snowden that may have spurred China to become more ambitious in cyber-space.
But in cyber-space, the real concern is broader.
What is notable about Chinese intelligence activity online is an appetite for data on a massive scale. Beijing's pursuit of what is often called bulk data - large scale data sets which might contain financial, personal, health or other types of information - is what alarms Western security officials.
""China has been trying to collect population level data on British people,"" according to Ciaran Martin, a former head of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre.
""That may be useful to train artificial intelligence or to better understand the country or even influence opinion or possibly even to work out what our vulnerabilities are individually and collectively.
""It is not always effectively carried out but it is very different from the kind of 'normal' spying on government and politics that virtually all countries undertake.
""In this other respect, China is notable only for how brazen its spying sometimes is.""
Some of this data is stolen but sometimes it is suspected to be acquired through Chinese companies with access to the Western market.
There is one element that is trickiest for national security officials to deal with when it comes to China: how to balance the risks and the benefits of China's growing economic power.
A priority for the Chinese state - and its spies - is ensuring economic growth.
Observers often point to a kind of unspoken bargain: the Chinese public will tolerate the relative lack of political freedom and continued one-party rule as long as the state delivers economic benefits.
That is one reason that China has also been active for decades in pursuing economic as well as political and diplomatic secrets in a way Western countries have not. 
Sometimes this has been business secrets of companies – whether designs for new products or negotiating positions.
There are types of sensitive information that are not state secrets, like high-tech research into a new advanced material at a university, which has military as well as civilian applications.
MI5 says it is tackling ""a steady stream of attempts to lure UK academic experts"" in order to get hold of technology they are working on, often starting with approaches over networking sites like LinkedIn.
""In a world where the 'DNA' of military and economic power is built on ones-and-zeros [of digital information], when core intellectual property and process knowledge leak, entire industries can be upended - and with them move jobs, capital, and geopolitical leverage,"" says Andrew Badger, a former US intelligence official and co-author of an upcoming book, The Great Heist: China's Epic Campaign to Steal America's Secrets.
""The UK's current debate about how to prosecute spies, strengthen laws, and balance commerce with security should start from this historical truth: economic power can only be sustained with the resolute custody of secrets.""
As China's economic power grows – especially in advanced technology – one of the hardest risks to measure is the UK and other Western states' dependence on China in critical fields, including electric vehicles and critical minerals used in manufacturing.
This underpinned the debate about the Chinese telecoms company Huawei building a large part of the country's new 5G phone infrastructure. 
Chinese equipment was cheaper and often seen as better than those of competitors - but were there risks?
It was less about using it to spy - and more the fact that a relationship of dependency on another country for technology on which daily life depends opens the way to influence and even coercion. If you do something or say something Beijing does not like, could it cut you off?
In the end, technology from Huawei - which always denied it was a security risk - was excluded from 5G. But it was only the first Chinese company to go global and now there are many more.
So, does it matter if China builds new nuclear reactors? Or becomes the main supplier of green technology? And what about if people depend on the Chinese-originated social media platform TikTok for their news and information?
This is the area where the tension with the economic growth agenda become clearest. China is the second largest economy in the world, an important export market and source of investment. If we want to secure the benefits of this relationship then it becomes much harder to exclude Chinese companies from the UK market.
Any kind of blanket ban on Chinese technology or companies would be absurd. But just how much should we open ourselves?
The other challenge for Britain is that, in many of these areas where economic and national security mix, the US is taking a tougher stance - and Washington is seeking to pressure London to come into line. 
That leaves London caught between pressure from Beijing and Washington and trying to work out how to address these threats while also maintaining productive relationships.
None of this is easy - and not much of it is to do with traditional spying. In this new world, threats are far broader and more complex. 
But without a clear, consistent China strategy that is confidently expressed, this government – like previous governments - will continue to find it hard to know how to navigate.

If you thought gaming was getting expensive, here’s some news that’ll make your wallet weep: Microsoft’s next Xbox console could retail for around $1,200 when it launches in 2027.
According to multiple industry insiders and recent comments from Xbox President Sarah Bond, Microsoft is going all-in on the premium market with its next-generation hardware.
Bond recently told Mashable that “the next-gen console is going to be a very premium, very high-end, curated experience.” Translation: start saving now.
But here’s the twist—this won’t be just another game console. According to Windows Central, Microsoft is building a full Windows gaming PC with an Xbox interface on top. That means access to Steam, Epic Games Store, and other PC marketplaces—not just Xbox Game Pass.
Kepler_L2, a hardware leaker on X (formerly Twitter) with a proven track record of accurately leaking AMD console specifications—including being first to reveal PS5 Pro specs that later proved correct—estimates the next Xbox will cost around $1,200. As per his leaked specifications, the console could pack approximately 42% more silicon than the PS6, 20% more memory, and significantly beefier cooling systems—hardware differences that justify the premium price tag.
Moore’s Law Is Dead, a YouTube tech channel known for AMD hardware leaks (and whose PS5 Pro specifications were accurate enough that Sony filed copyright strikes to remove the videos), corroborates this range, placing it between $800 and $1,200.
Unlike previous console generations, Microsoft can’t subsidize the hardware by making up profits through exclusive game sales. Since this Xbox will support third-party storefronts where Microsoft doesn’t get a cut, they have to charge closer to actual manufacturing costs.
For comparison, Sony’s PS6 is rumored to launch at $600—exactly half the 2027 Xbox price. It’s worth noting that the current Xbox Series X already costs $649.99 after recent price increases, with the premium 2TB model hitting $799.99.
The internet’s reaction to the rumored price tag is predictable sticker shock.
“Yeah it’s officially over. Call it the Ex-box now,” one user tweeted.
Another tweet summed it up perfectly: “I’ll get it in 2030 when the price drops.”
Fueling this frustration is a year of recent Xbox price hikes: Game Pass subscriptions jumped 50%, console prices increased twice, and even developer kits went from $1,500 to $2,000. Microsoft is clearly repositioning Xbox as a premium brand.
Adding intrigue to the situation, retail giant Costco recently pulled all Xbox consoles from stores and online, calling it a “business decision.” The gaming community suspects that the upcoming price increases influenced that move.
Microsoft seems to be targeting PC gaming enthusiasts who want the convenience of consoles with the versatility of PCs. For that niche market, a $1,200 machine that plays everything might make sense. But let’s be real: most gamers—especially parents buying for their kids—won’t drop that kind of cash when the PS6 offers similar experiences for half the price.
The $1,000 ROG Xbox Ally X handheld (which is currently sold out) suggests there’s at least some market for premium Xbox hardware. But a $1,200 console represents a fundamental shift: Xbox is no longer competing for the mainstream market. It’s becoming a premium PC gaming brand that happens to include console features.
Microsoft is making a bold bet that enough wealthy enthusiasts exist to sustain an ultra-premium Xbox brand. They might be right—high-end PC gaming components sell well, after all. But they’re also effectively conceding the mass market to Sony and Nintendo.
Whether this strategy is brilliant or delusional depends on execution and whether Microsoft can justify that price tag. One thing’s certain: the console wars just got a whole lot more expensive.
Microsoft hasn’t officially confirmed pricing yet, so take these reports with appropriate skepticism. But when multiple credible sources, including the Xbox president herself, are talking about “very premium,” it’s worth paying attention.

33,2025-10-30,"NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang dismisses claims of the AI bubble, indicating that the technology will lead to revolutionary innovation across the globe.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Major tech corporations are scrambling to embrace generative AI, even as critics warn it may be a fleeting trend. Speculations suggest that investor enthusiasm may be waning, potentially forcing them to redirect their capital toward more promising opportunities.
However, NVIDIA is seemingly making the most out of the AI bubble, as it briefly became the world's first company to hit $5 trillion in market valuation. The chipmaker's success can be primarily attributed to the rise in demand for AI chips to facilitate sophisticated advances and development in the ever-evolving landscape.
On Wednesday, NVIDIA's shares rose by more than 3%, causing its market capitalization to cross the coveted $5 trillion threshold (via CNBC). This news doesn't come as a surprise, as the chipmaker's market capitalization has been steadily growing as demand for AI chips increases.
After the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in 2022, NVIDIA surpassed $1 trillion in market capitalization, swiftly rising to $2 trillion in February 2024, and then $3 trillion in June later that year. In June this year, the chipmaker became the first $4 trillion company in the world, followed by Microsoft and Apple.
And as it now seems, the sky is no longer the limit for the chipmaker, as it recently hit the $5 trillion market valuation threshold. It doesn't appear that the company will be stopping anytime soon...
For context, CEO Jensen Huang recently revealed that the company expects up to $500 billion in AI chip orders. In 2023, NVIDIA was named the most profitable semiconductor chip brand in the world, with Microsoft and Facebook's Meta among its A-list clients.
Despite concerns that the world is trapped in an AI bubble that is poised to burst, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang dismissed these claims. The executive indicated that the boom in the AI landscape is driven by real demand, not speculation (via artificial intelligence on IG).

I don't believe we are in the AI bubble. And the reason for that is, we're going through a natural transition from an old computing model based on general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. We also know that AI has now become good enough because of reasoning and research capabilities. Its ability to think, it's now generating tokens, and now generating intelligence that's worth paying for.
The executive claims that AI will stand the test of time, revolutionizing innovation at a global scale for decades. He says the technology will be as revolutionary (if not more) that the rise of the internet rather than just a passing fad.
Despite claims that AI is just a passign fad, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang is confident that the technology will evolve, revolutionizing innovation at a global scale. 
Briefly, yes. NVIDIA’s market cap surged past $5 trillion, making it the most valuable company in the world — for a moment.
With every major tech corporation hopping onto the AI bandwagon, there's a rise in demand for chips from NVIDIA to facilitate its sophisticated advances.
That’s the trillion-dollar question. Some analysts see long-term fundamentals; others worry about overexuberance and supply chain bottlenecks.
NVIDIA’s rise reflects how central AI has become to the global economy — and how much capital is chasing the next computing platform.

Chipotle has a Gen Z and millennial problem.
Boatwright said in a Wednesday earnings call that customers who make less than $100,000, a core audience accounting for 40% of Chipotle's sales, have pulled back their spending.
He said that customers in the 25- to 35-year-old age group were ""particularly challenged,"" a trend he said was not unique to Chipotle. This cohort, which includes older Gen Zers and younger millennials, makes up about 25% of the chain's total sales, per Boatwright.
""This group is facing several headwinds, including unemployment, increased student loan repayment, and slower real wage growth,"" the executive said.
""We're not losing them to the competition. We're losing them to grocery and food at home,"" Boatwright said. He said they were not avoiding Chipotle entirely, just coming by less frequently.
""They feel the pinch, we feel the pullback from them as well,"" he added.
Chipotle on Wednesday released its third-quarter results, reporting a 7.5% revenue increase to $3.0 billion compared to the same period a year before. However, its same-store sales remained flat.
The chain's stock price had dropped by about 16% in after-hours trading early Thursday. It has sunk about 33% in the past year.
Like many other fast-casual chains, Chipotle has struggled in recent months with slumping sales as consumers tighten their spending, opt to visit only their favorite restaurants, and increasingly seek out value-driven promotions. In July, Chipotle reported a 4% decline in same-store sales, one of the brand's worst quarters since 2020.
In an effort to attract new and returning customers, the chain has introduced a loyalty program targeting college students and revamped its menu with limited-time offerings, including the return of its carne asada and the debut of its red chimichurri sauce in September. 
Chipotle has also set its sights on further international expansion, announcing in September its plans to open its first restaurants in Asia, specifically in the Singapore and South Korean markets, next year. It will also open its first store in Mexico in early 2026.
Representatives for Chipotle did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

AT&T (T) has faced challenges in the past. Its stock fell by over 30% in a period of less than two months on two occasions throughout various years, erasing billions in market value and negating significant gains in a single correction. If historical patterns hold, AT&T (T) stock remains susceptible to unexpected, rapid declines.
The Risk That Is Evolving
The key issue isn’t where T stock is headed, but rather how your portfolio is structured. Discover how Trefis High Quality Portfolio and Empirical Asset Management are preparing you.
 
Is Risk Evident in Financials Yet?
It certainly alleviates risk if the fundamentals are strong. For more details on T, read Buy or Sell T Stock. Below are some critical numbers.
How Severe Can It Really Get?
Examining T’s risks during significant market declines provides context. The stock tumbled nearly 46% during the Global Financial Crisis and by about 39% in the Dot-Com crash. During the inflation shock, it experienced a decline of roughly 37%, while the downturn related to Covid and the correction in 2018 both incurred drops around 30%. Even with robust fundamentals, T has not been shielded when broader markets face pressure. This serves as a reminder that in times of uncertainty, substantial corrections are a normal occurrence.
However, the risk isn’t confined solely to major market crashes. Stocks can drop even when the markets are performing well – consider events such as earnings announcements, business updates, and outlook revisions.

It’s been in David Bailey’s words, “a Saving Private Ryan-style combat.” Over the past six months, the 35-year-old CEO of Nakamoto Holdings, a digital asset treasury firm he built to house corporate bitcoin reserves, has watched his boldest bet yet—a merger with a small publicly traded Utah healthcare company called KindlyMD—go from triumph to trial.
“I’ve been too busy getting my ass kicked in the stock market,” he says, referring to the firm’s share price that has plummeted from $25 to 92 cents in six months.
Bailey isn’t your typical Nasdaq-listed corporate executive. He’s best known as the CEO of Bitcoin Magazine and the world’s largest bitcoin conference. He is also the man who helped “orange-pill” Donald Trump. “Our goal,” he says, “is to be the world’s number one bitcoin company.”
In May, Utah’s KindlyMD, a $2.7 million (revs) publicly-traded operator of healthcare clinics offering traditional and alternative medicine, announced a reverse merger with Bailey’s Nakamoto with the intent of becoming a holding company for bitcoin. The combined entity now trades on Nasdaq under the ticker NAKA and holds roughly $653 million worth of the cryptocurrency.
Wall Street doesn’t think much of Bailey’s plan. After peaking near $35 in May, NAKA spent most of October under $1 and at a 98% discount to the 5,765 bitcoin it holds on its balance sheet.
Turns out Nakamoto is a casualty of its own financing. To raise capital for its crypto purchases, the company executed a series of private investment in public equity (PIPE) deals, totaling approximately $563 million. These deals sold hundreds of millions of new shares to private investors at a significant discount, massively diluting existing shareholders. The situation imploded in September when a large block of these PIPE shares became eligible for sale, flooding the market as investors rushed to lock in profits. This triggered the price collapse. Bailey poured gasoline on the fire with a letter to shareholders urging investors to “exit” his stock if they were just there for a short term flip.
“People that are just looking for a trade are actually very expensive capital for us,” says Bailey. “I’ve got feedback that some have not liked that perspective, but we want long-term aligned partners. This is an all-in bet for us.”
In fact, Bailey says he will soon fold in his other ventures—BTC Inc., the parent company of the Bitcoin Magazine, the Bitcoin Conference and an advisory business, as well as UTXO Management, which owns hedge fund 210k Capital and venture investment firm 2140,—into KindlyMD/Nakamoto. Forbes estimates that these entities could add as much as $200 million in value to the bitcoin treasury firm, increasing Bailey’s ownership stake, which currently stands at 3%.
Bailey declined to comment on Forbes’ figure, but says the cash from these businesses, which are profitable, should help KindlyMD buy more bitcoin. 210k Capital alone has quietly quadrupled its assets under management from about $100 million to $400 million since January, according to a source familiar with its finances.
The budding financier’s logic is straightforward: Michael Saylor has more than 600,000 bitcoin and doesn’t have or need much in the way of an operating business. Everyone else must have “a differentiated strategy to justify their existence.”
“We need to do things that create value, ” says Bailey. “Running operating companies is one of those ways.”
Despite KindlyMD’s Salt Lake City, Utah headquarters, Bailey operates mostly from his home in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. On zoom calls, he often sits in front of a large painting of a bank engulfed in flames. The work, by crypto artist Cypherpunk Now and one of hundreds in Bailey’s collection, is called “Bank on Fire.”
“When I’m meeting with bankers, I make sure that’s in the background,” he grins. It’s an apt backdrop for a man who wants to build a bank of his own, only with bitcoin.
Bailey grew up on a farm in Fayetteville, Tennessee, about an hour south of Nashville, and developed an early fixation with money and markets. He went on to study economics, finance, and math at the University of Alabama in 2009, intent on becoming an investment banker.
“I was a big Warren Buffett fan, used to go to every Berkshire Hathaway convention when I was in college and never in a million years would I have ever thought I’d buy bitcoin. It was so opposite of who I was at the time,” he recalls.
That changed in 2012, when a friend sent him an article about it. Bailey initially thought bitcoin was a scam, but found himself unable to prove it so in November of that year, when the asset’s price ranged from $10 to $12, he made his first investment.
In 2014, a year after graduation, Bailey joined Bitcoin Magazine, an early publication dedicated to the fledgling cryptocurrency and cofounded by Vitalik Buterin, who went on to found Ethereum. Not long after, Bailey and his college friend Tyler Evans acquired the magazine through BTC Inc., the company they cofounded.
To grow the brand, the pair launched the Bitcoin Conference in 2019—a festival-like gathering that has since become crypto’s Coachella of sorts and turned Bailey into one of bitcoin’s most prominent evangelists. Last year, the event in Nashville, which featured then-presidential candidate Donald Trump, drew 35,000 believers, investors and politicians.
The path to Trump began, as Bailey tells it, with a conversation in Puerto Rico in 2024: how to get the president interested in bitcoin. “Paul Manafort was the initial gatekeeper who got us into the circle,” he says. Soon Bailey’s group was pitching at Trump Tower. The message was simple: bitcoin voters would matter in the presidential elections. Trump, always the dealmaker, decided to take the meeting. If Bailey and his friends could deliver votes and enthusiasm, crypto would get a hearing.
“Trump turns everything into a season of The Apprentice. You're always auditioning,’’ he adds. “‘Okay, you want to be a bitcoin adviser? I'm gonna go find three other people who also want it and you all are going to compete.’” Bailey won by rallying industry leaders to raise more than $100 million for his campaign. $21 million was raised during the Nashville conference alone, where Trump famously vowed to make the U.S. “the crypto capital of the planet.”
“He was very uncertain going in, but people cheered, and he walked out saying ‘these bitcoiners love me. These are my people’,” recalls Bailey, who now acts as an informal adviser to the president. In his view, Trump simply recognized that crypto had been treated differently from every other asset class (since the election Trump has made hundreds of millions off crypto). The goal now, he argues, is a level playing field, and the broader ambition is to make the U.S. the most favorable place in the world for bitcoin businesses.
Bailey claims to have invested in more than a hundred bitcoin firms over his 13-year-long career. His best performers, Metaplanet and Smarter Web, turned million-dollar checks into hundred-baggers. The payoff, he says, isn’t just financial. Good ideas get copied. “If ten thousand bitcoin companies bloom, we win.”
That long view, inspired by Buffett, now drives KindlyMD, which Bailey envisions as a large holding company owning profitable, independently run subsidiaries. To him, it’s not just an investment strategy but a rerun of monetary history. The bitcoin standard, as he calls it, echoes gold’s evolution: bullion houses became bullion banks, then central and investment banks. Bitcoin treasury firms, he argues, are today’s digital bullion houses on their way to becoming the new banks.
KindlyMD/Nakamoto is helping that transition. The firm has already invested in other bitcoin holding companies in Japan and Europe, namely Metaplanet and the Netherlands’ Treasury B.V. “Imagine seeding an ETF,” explains Bailey. “That’s what we’re doing—seeding these actively managed ETFs all over the world in the form of corporate equities.” Though the path to public markets via reverse mergers taken by many of these firms, including Bailey’s, sidesteps the kind of SEC review and vetting an exchange traded fund or an initial public offering would get.
The disastrous coming out party on Wall Street doesn't bother him much any more.
Says Bailey, “One of the best things about bitcoin is it’s very forgiving in the sense that you can make mistakes in your career and you can rebuild yourself.”"

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has gone from a little-known tech executive to a globally famous AI superstar very, very fast — and one photo from his trip to South Korea this week shows it.
During the trip — which coincides with President Donald Trump's meeting with China's leader, Xi Jinping — Huang did what many businesspeople do on trips and met some contacts for dinner.
In this case, he met Samsung Chairman Lee Jae-yong and Hyundai Executive Chairman Chung Eui-sun on Thursday.
As the trio sat down for food and beers at a Seoul fried chicken restaurant, a throng of journalists, photographers, and fans gathered outside.
Images of the meeting also show the reflection inside the restaurant, with fellow diners taking pictures on their phones. 
National broadcasters aired live footage of the executives eating, drinking, and talking.
People who watch this video may not believe it. 😂These characters are Jensen Huang, Lee Jae-yong, and Jeong Eui-sun. Yes, they are the CEO of Nvidia, Samsung, and Hyundai, respectively. pic.twitter.com/kMNI0KUVT1
Fried chicken and beer are a popular pairing in South Korea, known as Chi-maek. The three men met at a restaurant from the popular chain Kkanbu Chicken, whose name refers to a close friend.
During the meal, Huang gifted Lee and Chung boxes labeled Nvidia DGX — the firm's series of AI systems. Lee showed the cameras a note signed by Huang that read: ""To our partnership and future of the world!""
Bloomberg reported Tuesday that Huang plans this week to unveil contracts to supply chips to Samsung and Hyundai.
On Friday, the Nvidia boss is scheduled to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation CEO Summit in Gyeongju.
After the meal, Huang stepped outside and signed autographs on objects, including a $2 bill and a gift bag from a skincare store. He was also seen giving food from the restaurant to people waiting outside.
His fame has risen in tandem with Nvidia's value, as the AI boom drives huge demand for its chips.
On Wednesday, Nvidia became the first company to reach a market cap of $5 trillion. The company's share price has risen by over 1,500% in the past five years.

Convertible laptops with creative, flexible hinges are usually reserved for the premium end of the market, where prices climb well beyond what most people can comfortably afford. The Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio is a dream machine for designers and students. Still, its price tag puts it completely out of reach for anyone working with a tight budget or limited funds for technology investments that exceed a thousand dollars.
The NWNLAP H140S brings that unique pull-forward, 4-in-1 design to a much lower price point, around $500, depending on promotions and configurations you choose. It’s a laptop that looks the part and offers surprising versatility for everyday tasks, but also comes with a few trade-offs you’ll want to consider carefully before making a purchase. The design inspiration is clear, but so are the practical compromises.
Designer: NWNLAP






The H140S stands out with its 14-inch touchscreen and a 360-degree hinge that lets you use it as a traditional laptop, tablet, tent, or presentation stand during meetings and classes. The 16:10 aspect ratio at 1920×1200 resolution and slim aluminum profile give it a modern, premium vibe that’s genuinely hard to find in this price range for convertible designs.
The minimalist lines and overall aesthetic echo the Surface Studio’s distinctive appearance, making it a statement piece for classrooms, coffee shops, or home offices where visual presentation matters to you. For students or remote workers who want their tech to look professional without spending professional-level money on flagship devices, the visual appeal alone makes it worth considering despite its performance limitations.







Under the hood, the H140S runs on an Intel 12th Gen N95 processor with up to 32GB DDR4 RAM and SSD storage options reaching up to 2TB for extensive file storage needs. It’s more than enough for web browsing, note-taking, video calls, and office work throughout the day, but don’t expect smooth gaming, video editing, or heavy creative workloads that demand dedicated graphics processing power.

The 1920×1200 IPS LCD touchscreen is bright and responsive enough for reading, sketching with a stylus, or streaming video content during breaks, but it can’t match the color accuracy, contrast, or peak brightness of true premium panels found in laptops costing three times as much or more. The difference becomes noticeable when working with photos or design files that require precise color representation.

With two USB 3.0 ports, USB-C, mini HDMI, microSD card slot, and a 7-color RGB backlit keyboard, the H140S covers the basics for students and remote workers without requiring dongles for everything you need. Dual-band Wi-Fi and a 4500mAh battery promise several hours of use, though battery life will depend heavily on your workload and brightness settings throughout the day.

The H140S is fundamentally about trade-offs and knowing what you’re getting for your money before committing. You get a flexible, Surface Studio-inspired design and impressive specs for around $500, but you’ll notice compromises in display quality, trackpad precision, build refinement, and overall performance under demanding tasks. For those who want the look and versatility of a premium convertible without the premium price, it’s a smart option.

Chipotle's stock plunged 22% on Thursday after the company missed Wall Street's Q3 revenue estimates. 
The fast-casual food chain revealed something else that may be even more concerning for investors.
As CEO Scott Boatwright highlighted, Chipotle is facing significant pressure on the macroeconomic front, particularly from one of its key customer bases: people in their 20s and 30s, who aren't spending as much on burritos and so-called slop bowls as they used to.
These challenges prompted Chipotle to reduce its full-year sales outlook for the third consecutive quarter, resulting in its worst trading day in thirteen years. Shares of competitors Cava Group and Sweetgreen fell as much as 8% and 6%, respectively.
Chipotle isn't the only company in the space that's being severely affected by this slowdown in spending. It is part of a group of companies that serve what are informally dubbed ""slop bowls."" While that term may not sound endearing, companies such as Chipotle, Cava, and Sweetgreen have enjoyed an undeniable rise in popularity as people in the 25-35 age range have embraced quick-serve bowls, burritos, and salads.
However, these consumers have battled unfavorable economic conditions in 2025, forcing them to cut back on luxuries like eating out in order to prioritize other things.
""A particularly challenged cohort is the 25- to 35-year-old age group,"" Boatwright said on Chipotle's earnings call. ""This group is facing several headwinds, including unemployment, increased due loan repayment, and slower real wage growth.""
This is well-reflected in the slop bowl stocks' individual performances this year:
In December 2024, Chipotle announced plans to increase its prices in order to offset higher costs. The sentiment that slop bowl prices are too high has spread throughout the year — and it applies to other chains in the space as well. As Business Insider's Emily Stewart reported, traffic to other slop bowl restaurants has fallen this year.
While some economists have predicted a recession is approaching, others have disputed this claim, pointing to the stock market's solid performance as proof that the economy remains strong.
However, if Gen Z and younger millennial consumers are actively scaling back their Chipotle and Sweetgreen spending, it may be taken as a sign that economic conditions are getting worse.

 Stock futures are losing ground amid a barrage of earnings reports from major companies, as investors assess the latest developments in trade talks and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's warning that more rate cuts aren't a certainty; President Donald Trump said his meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping resulted in a rare earths mineral agreement and a reduction in certain tariffs on China; shares of Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) are losing ground after the Magnificent Seven members reported results late yesterday, while Alphabet (GOOG) shares are surging after the Google parent reported more than $100 billion in quarterly sales; Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) are due to release their quarterly reports after the closing bell; and Eli Lilly (LLY) shares are rising after the company reported strong sales of weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro. Here's what you need to know today.

 Stock futures are lower as investors digest a flurry of corporate earnings reports and evaluate the results of trade talks between the U.S. and China. The major indexes hit record highs yesterday but gave back early gains after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that another interest rate cut at the upcoming December meeting was “not a foregone conclusion—far from it."" The comments came after the Fed trimmed its benchmark rate for the second time in as many months to support a labor market that has weakened. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 0.4% recently, while those linked to the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-focused Nasdaq slipped 0.2%. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on a wide array of consumer and business loans, was at 4.10%, up from 4.06% at yesterday's close and at its highest level in three weeks. Bitcoin was at $109,800, down from an overnight high of around $111,600. Gold futures fell slightly from yesterday's close to $3,985 an ounce, and are well off the record high of near $4,400 set early last week.

 President Trump reportedly said that “a lot of decisions were made” in his meeting with Chinese leader Xi on Thursday, potentially signaling a thaw in trade relations between the two nations. Trump said that an agreement on rare earth minerals was reached after China restricted exports of the key product for high-tech manufacturing. The agreement will need to be renewed every year. Trump also said that U.S. tariffs targeting China’s fentanyl production were reduced to 10% from 20%, taking overall U.S. tariffs on Chinese products down to 47%. More negotiations could be coming as Trump said he will visit China in April, with Xi making a visit to the U.S. sometime after that. The agreements are expected to add some certainty to U.S. trade policy after tariff announcements roiled markets earlier this year.

 Shares of Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) are lower in premarket trading after the Magnificent Seven members delivered their highly anticipated quarterly results, while Alphabet (GOOG) stock soared after the Google-parent hit a new revenue milestone. Alphabet’s earnings topped Wall Street expectations as quarterly revenues topped $100 billion for the first time, with each of its major business segments reporting sales growth of at least 10%. Microsoft also posted better-than-expected earnings as quarterly revenue jumped 18% year-over-year, led by 28% growth in cloud sales, though the stock fell amid concerns about the company's capital spending plan. Facebook parent Meta also reported strong revenue growth, but a one-time $16 billion tax charge helped sink its earnings well below estimates.  Alphabet shares were up about 8% ahead of the opening bell, while Meta tumbled 9% and Microsoft declined 2%..

 More Magnificent Seven company earnings are on tap today, with Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) set to release results after the closing bell. Apple shares hit record highs recently, boosting its market capitalization above $4 trillion (only Nvidia and Microsoft have higher market values), following a report that showed solid sales of newly released iPhone 17 models.  Apple’s stock has fallen after recent earnings reports on investor worries over its progress on AI products. Meanwhile, Amazon has been the laggard among “Mag 7” stocks this year, and options pricing suggests that traders expect a big move for the online retailer’s share price after the earnings report is released today. Apple shares were up 0.5% in recent premarket trading, while Amazon stock fell more than 1%.

 Eli Lilly (LLY) shares are rising after the drugmaker reported better-than-expected earnings on strong demand for its weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro. Lilly reported third-quarter revenue of $17.6 billion, a jump of 54% over the prior year and ahead of analyst estimates of $16.1 billion as tracked by Visible Alpha. The company’s adjusted earnings per share of $7.02 beat the consensus estimate of $5.91. Eli Lilly reported strong sales growth of key drugs, with worldwide Mounjaro revenue doubling to $6.52 billion, while U.S. sales of Zepbound nearly tripled to $3.57 billion. Eli Lilly shares were up 4% in recent premarket trading.

CNBC. “Trump cuts fentanyl tariffs on China to 10%, says U.S. reached rare earths deal with Beijing.”
CNBC. “Microsoft stock drops on forecast for increased spending growth this year.”
Eli Lilly. “Lilly reports third-quarter 2025 financial results, highlights R&D pipeline momentum and raises 2025 guidance.”"

Amazon's latest quarterly earnings report could answer one of Wall Street's biggest questions: Is the company cutting jobs because growth is stalling, or is the retail giant's big bet on AI making it more efficient?
First scenario: The company announced 14,000 layoffs earlier this week because it's worried about its performance and wants to cut costs.
Second scenario: The tech giant has become so great at artificial intelligence that its operations are becoming way more efficient, and it doesn't need as many employees now.
The results, and a conference call with analysts, should shed light on this. Of course, the reality could be a combination of these two scenarios or something entirely different.
When Amazon reports, there's also one particular number to watch: revenue growth for Amazon Web Services, the company's all-important cloud business.
For the third quarter, Wall Street expects AWS revenue to reach $32.4 billion, representing an 18% year-over-year increase, according to RBC Capital.
Microsoft reported on Wednesday that Azure and other cloud services revenue increased 40%, and Google Cloud grew 34%. Google executives revealed on the company's Wednesday earnings call that Google Cloud has signed more billion-dollar deals in the first nine months of 2025 than in the past two years combined. These numbers are not always strictly comparable with AWS, but that's still very fast growth to compete with.
If AWS growth exceeds expectations, that will likely be a relief for investors and could hint that scenario 2 is in play: AI transformation is taking hold, both for Amazon and its cloud customers.
If AWS revenue misses that 18% growth number, then Wall Street will probably worry more, and the first scenario could kick in: Those job cuts could be a defensive move.
Some analysts have been worried about AWS's lagging growth rate for at least a year. The company was a pioneer in the cloud, but AI is changing the market and giving rivals a new way to compete.
Still, AWS remains the dominant player here, and it has promising opportunities, including a successful partnership with AI lab Anthropic.
AWS CEO Matt Garman told CNBC on Wednesday that the company feels ""quite good"" about its massive AI investments.

The stock market is heading into one of its best stretches of the year.
November has historically been among the best months for stocks — and there are a few areas where investors should concentrate on to capture the seasonal upside, analysts at Bank of America wrote note on Wednesday.
November and December are historically strong months for equity prices. Since 1927, the S&P 500 gained 59% of the time during November and rose by an average of 1%, according to BofA's analysis.
The odds that November will be another winning month for investors go up when considering that stocks are in the first year of a new presidential cycle and that the S&P 500 is on track to finish October with strong gains, the bank said. When the S&P 500 gained in October during a presidential year, the index gained 92% of the time in November, analysts said.
Here are some of the bank's investment ideas for investors looking for opportunities in the next month, based on historical returns:
Tech stocks. The Nasdaq 100 has been up 69% of the time in November, with an average gain of 2.47%.
Tech stocks within the S&P 500, meanwhile, were up 71% of the time in November with an average gain of 3.1%.
The market is cruising at all-time highs, bolstered by unrelenting enthusiasm for AI. Just this week, three mega-cap giants have achived market cap milestones, with Nvidia hitting a $5 trillion valuation and Apple and Microsoft both crossing $4 trillio. 
Investors were rattled earlier in the year by tariffs and concerns over the AI trade and the strength of the US economy, but they've shrugged off most headwinds as they move toward year-end. The S&P 500 is up 38.2% from its April low and up 17.6% for the year, carried largely by the frenzy for AI and optimism for future trade deals.

Teradyne (TER)’s stock increased by 51%, driven more by a remarkable increase in investor confidence than by revenue increases and margin declines. Stimulated by demand for AI, consistent earnings surpasses, and an optimistic analyst forecast, the surge suggests confidence that extends well beyond the quarterly figures—let’s explore what is genuinely motivating this increase.
So what is occurring here? The stock jumped by 51%, propelled by a slight 3.3% increase in revenue, an 11% decrease in net margin, and a notable 62% rise in the P/E multiple. Let’s investigate what lies behind these changes.

It plummeted over 82% during the Dot-Com bubble burst and nearly 84% during the Global Financial Crisis. Recent shocks, such as the inflation spike, led to a decline of about 58%. Even less severe pullbacks—like the 2018 correction and the Covid crash—saw drops of approximately 40%. Therefore, regardless of the positives, TER has not been insulated when the broader market suffers a decline.
Consistently selecting winners is a challenging endeavor—especially considering the volatility that comes with individual stocks. Instead, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, composed of 30 stocks, has demonstrated a solid track record of outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four years. Why is this the case? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded better returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; presenting a smoother ride, as demonstrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics."

Get a free partner Pokemon pin when you purchase Pokemon Legends: Z-A for Nintendo Switch 2 from Walmart.

 Pokemon Legends: Z-A + Mystery Pin (Nintendo Switch 2) 
 $69 | Walmart Exclusive 
 
 
If you haven't picked up Pokemon Legends: Z-A but were planning to soon, you can get a free bonus when buying the Nintendo Switch 2 edition from Walmart. The retailer has restocked its exclusive mystery pin bonus for the Switch 2 version of Z-A. While it may not be as cool as Best Buy's sold-out desk mat bonus, you aren't paying any extra for the enamel pin. In fact, Walmart is selling Pokemon Legends: Z-A for $69, otherwise known as 99 cents below MSRP. 
Your copy of Pokemon Legends: Z-A for Switch 2 will include an enamel pin of one of the three partner Pokemon or the game's logo:
Walmart started offering the mystery pin bonus on July 22 and sold out well before launch for Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch. Unfortunately, the Nintendo Switch edition bundled with the mystery pin remains sold out as of October 30.
 
 
Z-A is the second game in the Pokemon Legends series. If you haven't played Pokemon Legends: Arceus, which launched back in 2022 and earned rave reviews, you can grab a physical copy for $53 at Amazon or Walmart.
If you want to play Pokemon Legends: Z-A with an appropriately themed controller, Amazon is selling the officially licensed Pikachu Vortex Enhanced Wireless Controller by PowerA for only $30 (was $60). The controller syncs to Nintendo Switch 2 and original Switch via Bluetooth. 
PowerA also released a Pokemon Mega Evolutions Edition of its Advantage Wireless Controller this week. Priced at $70, this is the first third-party wireless controller to have the new C button for GameChat. It also benefits from a few enhanced features such as anti-drift Hall Effect sticks.
 
The sequel to Pokemon Legends: Arceus takes players back to Kalos, the setting of Gen 6's Pokemon X and Y for 3DS. The bustling metropolitan setting of Lumiose City will offer a significant change of pace from rolling hills and wilderness in Pokemon Legends: Arceus. Your first partner Pokemon will be either Chikorita, Totodile, or Tepig. The streamlined catching system from Arceus returns, so you don't need to battle every wild Pokemon you encounter before lobbing a Poke Ball at them.
Z-A's battle system represents a major departure for the series. The traditional turn-based combat from Arceus and the mainline series has been replaced by a strategic real-time system. You and your partner Pokemon can move during combat encounters--though you're confined to a specific area. Positioning and timing impacts your success on the battlefield, both when attacking and defending incoming attacks by executing dodges.
Along with the new and reworked elements, a familiar system returns after a long absence. Mega Evolutions, which last appeared in Pokemon: Let's Go, Pikachu and Eevee in 2018, temporarily turn your partner Pokemon into a super powerful version of itself. Mega Evolutions also alter the appearance of your Pokemon, but only certain species have Mega Evolutions, and you'll need a Mega Ring and a Pokemon-specific Mega Stone to activate it.
As part of the September Nintendo Direct, Nintendo revealed a paid DLC for Pokemon Legends: Z-A called Mega Dimension. The DLC is available to purchase now for $30 and is expected to launch February 28, 2026. The storyline centers on Mega Evolutions and prominently features Raichu, who has not one, but two Mega Evolutions. Along with the story expansion, the Mega Dimensions DLC comes with Raichu-themed Holo-X and Holo-Y Mega Evolution apparel items, which can be used in the game immediately.

Despite Broadcom climbing 13% in the last week, its competitor Nvidia might be a more attractive option. Regularly assessing alternatives is fundamental to a solid investment strategy. Nvidia (NVDA) stock displays better revenue growth over significant periods, greater profitability, and a relatively lower valuation compared to Broadcom (AVGO) stock, indicating that investing in NVDA may be advantageous.
Nvidia’s vertically integrated platform, including its cutting-edge Blackwell GPUs, NVLink interconnects, and proprietary CUDA software stack make it indispensable for AI data centers needing massive parallel processing power. In comparison, Broadcom’s custom silicon (ASICs) and AI networking solutions serve specific client needs through long-term contracts, representing a potentially lower long term growth model.
Quiz time: Over the past 5 years, which index do you believe the Trefis High Quality Portfolio outperformed—the S&P 500, S&P 1500 Equal Weighted, or both? The answer might surprise you. Discover how our advisory framework increases your chances of success.
AVGO designs and provides semiconductor devices and infrastructure software, offering solutions such as set-top box system-on-chips, cable, DSL, and passive optical networking. NVDA delivers graphics, computing, and networking solutions for gaming, visualization, data centers, and automotive markets.
Valuation & Performance Overview
Note: For “Last 3 Year Return” metric, the preferred stock is the one with higher returns unless the returns are exceedingly high (>300%), which poses a risk of sell-off.

Comcast (CMCSA) may not be a high-growth story, but its steady profits, strong cash flows, and discounted valuation make it worth a closer look.Comcast stock merits your attention. Why? Because you benefit from high margins – indicative of pricing power and cash generation ability – at a discounted price. Here are some details.
While revenue growth is beneficial, this doesn’t present a growth outlook. Pricing power and high margins yield consistent, predictable profits and cash flows, minimizing risk and facilitating capital reinvestment. The market typically rewards this.
For some context, Comcast functions as a global media and technology firm, providing cable communications, television and streaming services, film studios, theme parks, and international media solutions.
But do these numbers tell the full story? Read Buy or Sell CMCSA Stock to see if Comcast still has an edge that holds up under the hood.
Is holding CMCSA stock risky? Of course it is. High Quality Portfolio mitigates that risk.
Stocks Like These Can Outperform. Here Is Data
This is how we select: We look for stocks valued over $10 billion in market capitalization, then filter out those with high CFO (cash flow from operations) or operating margins. We also consider only stocks that have significantly declined in valuation in the last year.
The following are statistics for stocks utilizing this selection criteria since 12/31/2016.
But Consider The Risk
However, CMCSA is not protected from significant declines. It dropped 44% during the Dot-Com Bubble and 62% during the Global Financial Crisis. The inflation shock led to a 52% pullback, and both the 2018 correction and Covid pandemic erased about 28-31%. Even robust companies feel the pressure when markets sour. Risk is a reality, regardless of the advantages.
The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably surpassing its benchmark, which includes all three – the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. Why is that? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have generated better returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; a smoother ride, evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics."

Eli Lilly stock (NYSE: LLY) is up 7% in a month, warranting investor attention following a key corporate development. Eli Lilly recently announced a significant partnership with Walmart to sell its popular weight-loss drug, Zepbound, at a discounted retail price through Walmart pharmacies. 
The stock’s current price action suggests a potential buying opportunity based on historical performance. LLY is presently trading within a well-defined support range of $772.85 – $854.21. Over the past ten years, the stock has tested and attracted significant buying interest at this specific support level three times. Historically, following a bounce from this range, Eli Lilly’s stock has achieved an average peak return of 20.2%. The current correction, despite the recent 7% gain, places the stock firmly back into a price zone from which it has previously delivered substantial returns.
But is the price movement sufficient on its own? It certainly helps if the fundamentals are solid. For LLY, read Buy or Sell LLY Stock to assess how compelling this buying opportunity could be.
Markets tend to reward quality over time, and that’s what  the High Quality Portfolio encapsulates.
Here are some quick data points for Eli Lilly that should aid decision making:
For a quick overview, Eli Lilly offers innovative pharmaceuticals worldwide, including treatments for cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and autoimmune disorders such as psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis.
That being said, Lilly is not exempt from significant declines. The stock decreased by 51% during the Global Financial Crisis and by 43% during the Dot-Com bubble. Even during more recent upheavals, such as the 2018 correction, inflation shock, and Covid pandemic, it experienced drops ranging from 18% to 22%. Thus, despite its robust fundamentals, this stock can incur a substantial decline when market conditions worsen.
Investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics."

Samsung has posted its third-quarter 2025 results, and the numbers are huge. The company’s operating profit surged 32.5% year over year to KRW 12.2 trillion (about $8.5 billion). While a massive boom in semiconductor chips is fueling this fire, a closer look shows that the company's big bet on foldable phones is also a core part of Samsung’s financial success.
The Mobile eXperience (MX) division, which handles Galaxy smartphones, booked revenue of KRW 34.1 trillion and operating profit of KRW 3.6 trillion. Samsung's official report states this growth, both quarter-on-quarter and year-over-year, was driven by the launch of new foldable phones.
That’s a direct nod to the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7. These devices, along with other flagship models and strong tablet and wearables sales, drove the mobile division's revenue up 11% from the previous quarter.
 



Meanwhile, the Device Solutions (DS) segment, which includes Samsung’s memory, foundry, and other semiconductor operations, saw sales rise 19% from the previous quarter. The Memory business set a new revenue record, thanks mostly to strong demand for HBM3E chips and server SSDs.
Samsung's semiconductor business posted an operating profit of KRW 7.0 trillion. To put that in perspective, its profit was just KRW 400 billion in the second quarter. This growth is almost entirely thanks to the AI boom.
With the AI infrastructure build-out underway, HBM3E and server SSD demand shot up, pushing Samsung’s Memory Business to an all-time high quarterly revenue.
This combination gives Samsung a strong advantage. The chip division is making the most of the booming AI market, while the mobile division is showing that its focus on foldable phones is working.
Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android
Samsung's display division (SDC) also improved, earning KRW 1.2 trillion in profit due to strong demand for flagship smartphones.
It all adds up to a consolidated revenue of KRW 86.1 trillion ($60.5 billion) and a net profit of KRW 12.2 trillion for the quarter. These results, which beat analyst expectations, show Samsung's two biggest bets are paying off at the same time.

The financial technology giant Fiserv stock (NASDAQ: FI) crashed 44% yesterday, October 29, 2025, sending shares to around the $70 level after the company announced shockingly bad third-quarter earnings and a significantly reduced full-year forecast.
The massive stock decline was driven by a confluence of negative financial and operational news. Fiserv’s results missed Wall Street expectations on two major fronts: adjusted earnings of $2.04 per share fell short of the $2.72 analyst consensus, and revenue of $5.26 billion missed the $5.56 billion forecast. Compounding this disappointment, the company drastically lowered its full-year earnings guidance to a range of $8.50-$8.60 per share from the previous outlook of $10.15-$10.30.
Operational and external challenges also fueled the crash. Fiserv reported a slowdown in organic revenue growth to just 1% for the quarter, including much slower growth in the crucial Merchant Solutions segment (which features the Clover platform). Management attributed this weakness partly to a slowdown in cyclical growth in Argentina and the impact of interest rates. Adding to the investor uncertainty were both a sudden senior leadership overhaul and ongoing legal concerns regarding alleged inflated growth tied to the Clover platform.
Given the dramatic drop, the key question is whether Fiserv stock is a buy at the current low valuation. While the price of around $70 looks attractive on the surface, the overall picture suggests a high-risk scenario. Considering yesterday’s severe developments, the new moderate revenue growth outlook, and the company's weak financial stability, we believe the stock is risky and should be avoided for now.
We delve into the company’s financial and operational performance in the sections below. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, FI stock looks cheap compared to the broader market.
Fiserv’s Revenues have grown marginally over recent years.
Fiserv’s profit margins are much higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe.
Fiserv's balance sheet looks weak.
FI stock has been more resilient compared to the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. Worried about the impact of a market crash on FI stock? Our dashboard – How Low Can Fiserv Stock Really Go? – has a detailed analysis of how the stock performed during and after previous market crashes.
In summary, Fiserv’s performance across the parameters detailed above is as follows:
• Growth: Moderate• Profitability: Very Strong• Financial Stability: Weak• Downturn Resilience: Strong• Overall: Moderate
Remember, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.
Considering Fiserv's moderate overall performance across the relevant parameters, despite its current low valuation, we conclude that the stock remains risky.
Now, of course, we could be wrong in our assessment, and investors may view the dramatically reduced price as a buying opportunity. However, our analysis suggests caution. We believe the stock is too risky to recommend at this time. Investors would be better served either waiting for proof of improved performance—specifically, an organic growth rate significantly higher than the meager 1% seen in the latest quarter—or by seeking better opportunities in other fintech stocks, such as SoFi (NASDAQ: SOFI), which has shown stronger recent performance."

I grew up in Jacksonville, Florida, the land of Lynyrd Skynyrd, Yellowcard, and the NFL's Jaguars.
Just south of my hometown, though, lies the historic city of St. Augustine, where I went on many field trips as a kid.
The quaint city is about 460 years old and is considered the oldest settlement of African-American and European origin to have been continuously occupied in the United States.
Known for its monuments, museums, shops, and stunning views of the Intracoastal Waterway and Atlantic Ocean, St. Augustine is a popular destination for tourists and one I still visit frequently as an adult.
And, after many day trips to St. Augustine, I think I've figured out the perfect way to spend a few hours there (and when to do it). 
St. Augustine is a pretty popular spot — so, it's up to me to plan accordingly if I want to see the city in a quieter, calmer way.
I typically avoid going between mid-November to mid-January, as the city's Nights of Lights display attracts thousands of visitors. This can lead to significant gridlock and traffic congestion, causing issues for residents.
Summer is also tricky, as there's a sea of vacationers ready to enjoy the Florida sunshine when school is out. I also try to avoid visiting when nearby schools are on their spring break — speaking from experience, that's a popular time for locals to go to St. Augustine.
All that said, early fall and late spring can be lovely times to visit.
On this trip, I headed to the area on a Saturday morning in May, where a cloudy sky seemed to work in my favor, allowing me to avoid too many crowds. 
On this day in May, I got an early breakfast at my favorite coffee shop in the world, The Kookaburra.
This Aussie-American espresso bar is one of the first spots where I got to know St. Augustine as an adult. I feel like a trip to Northeast Florida isn't complete without a stop here.
Its downtown location on Cathedral Place faces the Plaza de la Constitución, one of the oldest public places in America.
I especially love its Honey Badger latte (made with honey, cinnamon, and milk) and Aussie pies, which come in varieties like veggie coconut curry and Thai chicken chili.
The Kookaburra also has a rotating menu of baked goods, including gluten-free muffins and vegan doughnuts.
There's so much to see in St. Augustine. The Plaza de la Constitución is across from the Cathedral Basilica of St. Augustine, known as ""America's first parish.""
The art and architecture of the Cathedral Basilica are gorgeous and available for the public to enjoy on their own or with a tour. There are also free concerts on the first Friday of the month, and it's splendid to hear music while taking in the marble altar, gold statues, and stained-glass windows.
Just a short walk from the plaza is Flagler College, a small private college dating back to the 1800s.
The property was originally commissioned by Henry Flagler as the Hotel Ponce de León, a luxury seasonal hotel. It's been renovated many times, but students today are lucky to dine in Ponce Hall, an ornate work of art in itself featuring a vaulted ceiling and 40 stained-glass windows.
Access to the campus interior is limited, but visitors can purchase tours of the inside or enjoy the sprawling exterior's Spanish Renaissance architecture for free.
I also love walking on St. George Street, which is full of souvenir purveyors, eateries, and museums.
Nothing beats the indoor-outdoor shopping experience and pops of color in handmade pottery and flowy dresses at places like Gypsy Moon and Market to Market. 
The accessories curated by the nearby Red Pineapple boutique were a highlight in my high-school years.
Some stores are located in the St. George's Row shopping mall, where the Karpeles Manuscript Library Museum opened a miniature exhibit full of Disney animation sketches.
Other museums I've liked in years past are the Lightner Museum (inside a former Gilded Age hotel of Henry Flagler's), the Governor's House Cultural Center and Museum, and the St. Augustine Lighthouse and Maritime Museum.
Though I haven't been there yet, I've heard great things about Villa Zorayda, a historic Gilded Age home museum.
Casa Reina features Latin American, Mexican, and local coastal flavors — and some of its outdoor seating has a view of the Matanzas River (part of the Intracoastal Waterway).
I recommend its seafood-combo enchiladas, which are covered in a rich, decadent blue-crab cream sauce.
I also suggest popping by Vilano Beach, just north of historic St. Augustine. It has a decent amount of public parking and is a lovely place to watch the pastels of a Florida sunrise. 
While there, stop by The Reef Restaurant — it's got some great dishes with fresh mahi and shrimp.
Across the road (on the Intracoastal) is Cap's on the Water, which is known for its fantastic seafood. And, if you find yourself driving over to Anastasia Island (it is still in St. Augustine), pop by Beachcomber, where you can eat right on the water.
All in all, my ideal day in St. Augustine is a mix of old traditions and new adventures.
Since I stay with family regularly on Florida trips, there's no reason not to keep exploring corners of downtown St. Augustine that are less familiar to me. 
After all, I could discover a new favorite museum or lunch spot that I had never known about. And, of course, I'm always game to revisit old favorites.

Enphase Energy (ENPH) has had a rough run, but the fundamentals remain solid. The solar leader still generates healthy cash flow and holds a strong position in home energy solutions. With the stock back near historical support levels, investors may be looking at the early stages of another potential rebound.
ENPH stock is worth monitoring. Here’s why – it is currently positioned in the support zone ($29.58 – $32.70), levels from which it has previously made significant rebounds. Over the past 10 years, Enphase Energy stock attracted buying interest at this level on 3 occasions and subsequently managed to yield an average peak return of 312.4%
But is the price movement sufficient on its own? It certainly aids the case if the fundamentals have a strong basis. For ENPH Read Buy or Sell ENPH Stock to assess the persuasiveness of this buying opportunity.
Is investing in ENPH stock hazardous? Absolutely it is. High Quality Portfolio reduces that risk.
Here are some quick data points for Enphase Energy that should aid in decision-making:
For quick background, Enphase Energy offers innovative home energy solutions for the solar photovoltaic sector, catering to solar distributors, installers, OEMs, partners, and homeowners globally.
Enphase is not exempt from substantial declines. It decreased roughly 63% during the 2018 correction, nearly 60% amid the Covid crash, and experienced its largest setback with a 78% fall during the inflation shock. Even with all the favorable conditions, these drops highlight that the stock can be significantly affected when the market downturn. Solid fundamentals are essential, yet volatility is still an inherent aspect of investing.
However, the risk isn’t confined to significant market downturns. Stocks can decline even when markets are performing well – consider occurrences such as earnings reports, business updates, and outlook modifications.

Running requires commitment and you need a watch that keeps up with your training goals without draining your wallet or dying mid-marathon, and the Garmin Forerunner 255 delivers exactly that combo of reliability and performance. Amazon dropped the price to just $279, down from the usual $349, which makes this one of those rare moments where a premium running watch becomes accessible. The Forerunner 255 brings serious training tools that adapt to your performance, recover alongside you, and guide you through race preparation with the kind of intelligence previously reserved for much pricier models.
See at Amazon
The battery life alone distinguishes this watch from the sea of devices that require charging every other day: You get 14 days of smartwatch use in between charges, which means you can spend more time training and less time looking for cables. That goes up to 30 hours of continuous GPS tracking in GPS mode so ultra-runners and adventurers can take on the longest events without battery anxiety setting in.
Recovery drives performance just as much as hard training does, and the Forerunner 255 tracks that balance through HRV Status monitoring. Heart rate variability measurements happen automatically during sleep, analyzing how your body responds to training stress and daily life. The morning report consolidates everything into one snapshot when you wake up – your sleep quality, recovery status, and a personalized workout suggestion based on where you stand.
The fourth-generation Elevate optical heart rate sensor is more accurate than its predecessors, and reads directly from your wrist with fewer random spikes or dropouts. Multi-band GPS technology uses signals from multiple satellite frequencies to calculate your position with much better precision, particularly in demanding environments such as dense city blocks or forested trails. Tests showed this dual-frequency approach corrects signal bounce issues that plague standard GPS watches, keeping route maps accurate even when buildings or trees surround you. At 49 grams for the 46mm version (39 grams for the smaller 41mm model), it’s light enough during a run that you tend to forget you’re even wearing it but with enough heft to feel durable.
Training plans change according to your real performance and do not follow a rigid schedule without considering how you feel: The Forerunner 255 offers personalized daily workout suggestions that adjust after each run based on your completion times, effort levels and recovery needs. Race predictions estimate your finish time for 5K, 10K, half-marathon and marathon distances by looking at your current fitness level, typical training paces and even weather conditions on race day.
The multisport profiles transform this from a running-only device to a triathlon companion. Swimming metrics include stroke detection and SWOLF scores for pool sessions while open water swimming tracks your path across lakes or ocean. Cycling profiles record power data when paired with compatible meters, and the watch automatically detects when you transition between sports during brick workouts or races. Water resistance extends to 5 ATM (50 meters) so showers, pool sessions, and rainy runs pose no threat to the electronics.
This is our favorite early Black Friday deal on a smartwatch, it might run out of stock very soon.

69,2025-10-30,"Recovery efforts are under way across Jamaica after Melissa rips off roofs, cuts electricity and unleashes floodwaters.
Downgraded hurricane Melissa makes second landfall in Cuba after devastating Jamaica
By Fiona Kelliher and News Agencies

People across the northern Caribbean are reeling from the devastation of Hurricane Melissa as dozens of deaths are reported in Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti.
The hurricane – at Category 5, the strongest on record to hit Jamaica directly – ripped across the Caribbean islands on Tuesday and Wednesday, killing at least 25 people in Haiti, eight in Jamaica and one in the Dominican Republic.
The United States-based National Hurricane Center said early on Thursday that Melissa’s eye was expected to move away from the southeastern and central Bahamas before passing west of Bermuda.
Although the storm was downgraded to Category 1, the lowest strength on the Saffir-Simpson scale, it was still packing winds of 155km/h (100mph) with even higher gusts, the NHC reported.
In Haiti, where roughly 12,000 people remained in emergency shelters, families grappled with the rising death toll. Twenty people were reported dead in the southern coastal town of Petit-Goave alone, where a river burst its banks and collapsed dozens of homes.
Resident Steven Guadard told The Associated Press news agency that Melissa killed his entire family: “I had four children at home: a one-month-old baby, a seven-year-old, an eight-year-old and another who was about to turn four.”
Although no deaths were tallied in Cuba, more than 735,000 evacuated residents slowly returned home as the military helped to rescue people in isolated communities.
Recovery efforts were rolling out across Jamaica’s western parishes, where Melissa ripped roofs from homes, felled trees, flooded hospitals, and cut off electricity and water.
Yet even as Prime Minister Andrew Holness pledged a “credible and strong” recovery strategy, residents pleaded for help.
Sylvester Guthrie, a resident of the hard-hit parish of St Elizabeth, was left with only his bicycle.
“I don’t have a house now,” Guthrie told the AP. Although he has land in another location, he said, “I am going to need help.”
 

 
The centre of Melissa did not cross over Jamaica’s capital, Kingston, allowing emergency relief flights ferrying water, food and other supplies to start landing at Norman Manley International Airport after it reopened late on Wednesday.
As the prime minister took a helicopter tour of the damage, the Jamaica Public Service utility kicked off a damage assessment as the majority of the island’s 2.8 million residents were left without electricity. It warned them to avoid downed power lines “at all costs”.
To the island’s west, parishes, including St James and St Elizabeth, were rocked by torrential floodwaters, powerful winds and landslides.
In the historic port town of Black River, the hurricane levelled homes, destroyed historic buildings and flooded medical care facilities, destroying the “entire infrastructure”, Holness said in a video update from the town.
To the north, heavy construction equipment crawled through the mud-soaked streets of St James Parish to clear blockages and push aside felled trees. Video footage showed dazed residents wandering around outside to assess the damage.
The United States and the United Kingdom have pledged support.

The nation’s largest employers are doing a lot less employing lately. In recent weeks, Amazon announced it would cut 14,000 jobs, Paramount axed 1,000 people, Target let go of 1,800 employees, UPS said it will start a purge of 14,000 people with the aim of getting rid of 48,000 workers in total, and Meta laid off around 600 people from its AI lab. All that is happening as we enter the “jobless growth” economy, a world where no one is hiring but their profits keep climbing.
As the Wall Street Journal points out, many of the jobs getting hit at the moment are white collar work: office jobs that offer a relatively comfortable lifestyle and, typically, room for growth. But at the moment, the job market is stuck in “no hire, no fire” mode, meaning no one is coming in, no one is moving up, and no one is looking for other opportunities. Instead, the whole world is stagnantâexcept those getting caught under the corporate axe as they try to boost their bottom line for the fourth quarter earnings report.
As these jobs go away, the path into the world of work that once represented at least one route to the American Dream suddenly has no entry point and a much lower ceiling than it used to. Job postings for entry-level and early career roles are way down year over year. The market has pulled up the ladder for people trying to get in on the lower rungs, and the prospect of climbing it is getting harrowing, too. A recent report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia found that AI exposure is over three times higher for occupations that require a bachelorâs degree compared with those that donât.
The idea up in the C-suite is almost certainly that automation will be able to fill in those gaps, even though there’s little to suggest that it will actually play out that way. According to a study done by the Center for AI Safety, AI agents were only able to complete about 3% of the work assigned to them that humans can do reliably. Given that, it’s little surprise that a recent report published by research and advisory firm Forrester found that more than half of all employers who cut workers and tried to replace them with AI regret the decision.
But don’t worry, they’ll still come out ahead. The same report predicted that those companies would bring back human labor, just at lower wages and potentially by farming out roles to overseas workers.

72,2025-10-30,"Despite positive sales on Ray-Ban and Oakley smart glasses, Meta Quest losses brought Reality Labs losses up to $4.4 billion this quarter.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Meta is earning more advertising revenue than ever, and keeping people on its apps for longer, using AI, Mark Zuckerberg boasted during Meta's Q3 2025 earnings call. But it's also spending tens of billions on AI infrastructure to ""front-load"" computing capabilities for an AI Superintelligence, to the point that investors are spooked.
Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li outlined the company's highest-ever $51.2 billion revenue this quarter, but Meta's net income fell 83% YoY, thanks to major AI CapEx spending and a one-time $15.9 billion income tax from Trump's 2025 tax bill.
Tax one-off aside, Meta is promising that spending $19.4 billion this quarter on AI servers, data centers, and network infrastructure is ""very likely to be a profitable thing"" by accelerating their AI research on Superintelligence and producing better ads. It's a familiar strategy for Meta, which spends heavily on big-picture ideas like the ""Metaverse"" with the hypothetical promise of future ROI.
 



Meta boasted in the Q3 earnings call about the success of their recent AI glasses, including selling out most Meta Ray-Ban Display store stock within ""48 hours."" But Reality Labs R&D remained predictably expensive, costing them $4.4 billion in net losses this quarter after $470 million in revenue.
According to Li, even though they expect ""significant YoY growth in AI glasses revenue"" next quarter, thanks to the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 and Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses, profits will be ""more than offset by the headwinds of Quest headsets,"" because there's no Quest 3S launch this year.
It's a bit surprising that Ray-Ban sales aren't expected to cut into Reality Labs' losses, or at least match past Quest headsets' success during the holidays. Despite this, Zuckerberg assured investors that ""it will be a very profitable investment"" eventually, starting with revenue from selling the glasses and then building ""services"" on the hardware.
 



Zuckerberg continued on by explaining that R&D costs will continue for future devices like Meta Orion, their full-FoV AR glasses, and that smart glasses are still ""earlier in their curve"" before it can become a ""sustained business.""
Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android
Eventually, however, they plan to reach ""many hundreds of millions or billions of people, and that's the point at which we think this is going to be an extremely profitable business,"" Zuckerberg concluded.
The Meta CEO first brought up the idea of billions of smart glasses in an earlier earnings call; current estimates suggest it's still well short of ten million, but EssilorLuxottica plans to sell 10 million pairs of AI glasses per year starting in 2026, with Meta as its primary partner.
 



Meta claims that after this one ""Big Beautiful Bill"" tax payoff, there will be a ""significant reduction in our U.S. federal cash tax payments,"" lowering operations costs moving forward. But Meta will likely reinvest that money in AI instead.
After spending $70–72 billion total on CapEx in 2025, Li warns that ""total expenses will grow at a significantly faster percentage rate in 2026 than 2025, with growth driven primarily by infrastructure costs, including incremental cloud expenses and depreciation.""
This will help Meta build its Superintelligence that ""knows us deeply, understands our goals, and can help us achieve them."" Zuckerberg suggested that they're working on ""truly frontier models with novel capabilities,"" though he didn't say when these advanced AI tools will arrive.
Meta also warned investors that continued pressure from the European Union could lead to ""significant negative impact on our European revenue,"" while in the U.S., ""a number of youth-related trials are scheduled for 2026"" that could lead to losses. Meta has come under fire for allegedly covering up potential harms to children from VR games.

Stride (LRN) stock has decreased by 54.4% in a single day, despite the company posting better-than-expected Q1 earnings, as investors focused on its weak outlook and operational hiccups. While adjusted EPS of $1.52 and a 12.7% revenue jump to $620.9 million topped estimates, management’s guidance for next-quarter and full-year sales—both below Wall Street forecasts—sparked concerns about slowing momentum. The company also flagged technology rollout issues and higher student withdrawal rates, suggesting execution challenges that could pressure future growth. These factors overshadowed the earnings beat and triggered the steep sell-off in Stride’s stock.
The stock appears appealing, yet the past indicates it experiences a challenging recovery within a year following significant declines. Evaluate the following information:
While we prefer to purchase dips if the fundamentals are solid – for LRN, see Buy or Sell LRN Stock – we are cautious regarding falling knives. Specifically, it's crucial to consider if circumstances worsen and LRN drops an additional 20-30% to the $49 level, will we be able to maintain our stock position? What is the worst-case outcome? We term this downturn resilience. It appears that the stock has performed worse than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. We evaluate this based on both (a) how much the stock declined and (b) how rapidly it rebounded.
Investing in a single stock can be risky, but pursuing a broader, diversified strategy has substantial advantages. Should you invest in one stock you favor or construct a portfolio aimed at thriving across different economic cycles? Our analysis indicates that the Trefis High Quality Portfolio has transformed stock-picking uncertainty into outperforming consistency against the market. This portfolio is integrated into the asset allocation strategy of Empirical Asset Management — a wealth management firm based in the Boston area and a Trefis partner — whose asset allocation framework generated positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P experienced a decline exceeding 40%.
Below are the particulars; however, as a brief overview: LRN offers proprietary and third-party online curriculum, software, and career learning services to enhance individualized K-12 education and skill development in various industries globally.
2022 Inflation Shock
2020 Covid Pandemic
2018 Correction
 2008 Global Financial Crisis
 It is important to consider how low LRN could fall during a downturn. Additionally, you should examine how the stock performed in comparison to the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which includes 30 stocks, and has a history of comfortably outperforming its benchmark that encompasses all three — the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. What is the reason for this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk in comparison to the benchmark index; resulting in less volatility, as demonstrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

When theÂ really big sales events of the year get close â Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Amazon Prime Day, etc., one of the big questions is always “What’s Apple going to do?” If this new Amazon deal on the brand-new M5 iPad Pro is any indication, Apple’s going to be dipping at least a toe in the Black Friday pond in the weeks to come. For the first time, the 11-inch M5 iPad Pro is taking a price drop â it’s $949 right now, down by $50.
Apple fans and creative pros in particular are going to be all over this one, because the new M5 iPad Pro comes closer to full high-end laptop power than any tablet yet. The M5 chip is a game changer in terms of speed and pure power, and the newly released iPadOS 26 is a massive leap forward. The two combine with Apple Intelligence to create a tablet that can do nearly everything a powerful laptop can, especially if you add the Magic Keyboard to complete the experience.
See at Amazon
Strangely enough, the new IPad Pro is lighter than the iPad Air â 0.98 pounds, which speaks to just how much size and weight Apple has cut from their latest tablet design while amping up its power and ability. The M5 chip gets the lion’s share of attention, and deservedly so, but don’t sleep on the N1 wireless chip that’s also in the new iPad Pro, because it makes Wi-Fi 7, Thread, and Bluetooth 6 connections happen.
As with all things Apple, the screen on the M5 iPad Pro is best-in-class. It’s an Ultra Retina XDR tandem OLED screen with anti-glare treatment and an oleophobic coating that cuts down on fingerprints â an essential feature for an elite tablet. The ProMotion adaptive refresh rate ranges from 10Hz to a blistering 120Hz, and the peak performance of 1,600 nits delivers all of the exceptional quality of the screen in its full glory.
The M5 iPad Pro’s cameras and what it can do with the images are where this tablet really shines. The 12MP Wide camera at the rear of the tablet can shoot 4K ProRes video, and also be used as a powerful document scanner and AR code unlocking device. The front of the tablet has a powerhouse 12MP landscape Center Stage camera for pristine video calls and conferencing. When you shoot your videos or stills, Apple Intelligence takes over to deliver the best and most powerful range of editing and creative options of any tablet on the market.’
The first price break on this brand-new tablet is definitely an occasion, even if it’s just 5%. That might not be the case with other tablets, but the M5 iPad Pro was aÂ lot of tablet at its full $999 price, and now that it’s down to $949 at Amazon, it’s a more impressive deal yet.Â

Depends on the x-ray energy band and required power to achieve what is needed, but I suspect a copper or lead mask would suffice. If I knew their target energy level I could give a better idea of what would work for a mask.

From https://siliconangle.com/2025/10/28/substrate-raises-100m-impossible-reinvent-chipmaking-industry/ [siliconangle.com],
Substrate has already demonstrated its technology at the U.S. National Laboratories and at its own facilities in San Francisco, and offered some high-resolution images that show what it can do.Experts told the Journal that the images are impressive, but questions remain about Substrate’s ability to print at the scale required for the mass production of chips. Indeed, many are extremely dubious about the company’s plans, noting that it would need to maintain the same accuracy shown in the images over much larger areas of the silicon wafers and run at incredibly fast speeds. Chinese companies have been trying for years to match ASML’s capabilities, but have not yet succeeded despite spending billions of dollars on research.

Chinese companies have been trying for years to match ASML’s capabilities, but have not yet succeeded despite spending billions of dollars on research.
And ASML did not get to where they are at without buying US tech companies:
""ASML has acquired several US companies, including Cymer (2013) and Silicon Valley Group (SVG) (2001), as well as Brion Technologies in 2007. These acquisitions were strategic for obtaining critical technology, particularly light sources and lithography systems, to advance semiconductor manufacturing.""
From the article, "" Reuters was unable to independently verify the company's claims about its technology."" That said, sounds like they plan on using X ray wavelengths, which in theory could provide much better resolution than even EUV. Problems will be many including finding a photo resist that works with Xray and chip manufacturing as just the first one.So, for clarity, does this mean that this company is ahead or behind the Chinese companies that are also imminently catching up to ASML?

Standard start-up behavior.
They could have had a grad student with access to the now decades old proximity x-ray lithography equipment at US National labs make a pattern on a wafer. Then it's not lying, exactly.
Of course that old equipment worked at very low power and proximity lithography is almost unusable. For high throughput you'd need a Billion dollar accelerator for your x-ray source.
Ok so... one of these might exist. But the desktop is at least 15 meters long and the laser is 0.3 PW. The main body of the system is a tube of plasma, so enjoy keeping that stable on a production line...
If you handwave that the laser is likely half a billion by itself then sure, this tech is... at the point where someone could start a serious development process to turn it into an industrial system. In 5 to 10 years, I'd estimate...
EUV lithography light source power is sustained, this is 80fs pulses at 1kHz.
No, you have it all wrong. Start-ups forecast the truth ... it will eventually happen ... trust us.
Indeed.
If this is true then it won't be long until they sell the tech to the highest bidder of a foreign company. ""This is an opportunity for the U.S. to recapture this market with a homegrown company"" - grandiose idea until greed kicks in.
The US won't even permit companies in foreign countries from selling related tech willy nilly.  Wtf make you think a domestic company with breakthrough lithography technology will just sell out to foreign randos however they please.


Try making some sense when you post stuff.
Sorry dad.

If Dutch ASML feels threatened by the USA, all the do-not-sell-EUV-technology-to-countries-the-USA-hates agreements will be shredded, increasing the amount of competition.
... the claims made here are extremely dubious, and the importance of a home-grown alternative to ASML make this an ideal target for fraudsters.
It is not just ASML which is needed for extreme UV lithography machines. It is a whole ecosystem of European research institutes like IMEC [wikipedia.org] or optics companies like Carl Zeiss [wikipedia.org]. That a startup can credibly match their collective expertise is highly unlikely.

Following a favorable ruling in its long-running legal battle between NewJeans, HYBE shares rose on Thursday, October 30, climbing from 316,500 Korean won (approximately $221.77) to 324,500 KRW ($227.38) on the Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) for a gain of just over 5% on the day. 
A Seoul court ruled on October 30 that the exclusive contracts between NewJeans and HYBE subsidiary’s label ADOR remain valid, rejecting the group’s effort to terminate the agreements that began in the second half of 2024. The court said ADOR did not breach its duties simply by removing ADOR’s former CEO, Min Hee-jin, and found the label had continued management work including album, performance and advertising preparations for the quintet. 
The five members’ legal team said they will appeal, and the members say their relationship of trust with ADOR is “completely collapsed.”
After the ruling, ADOR issued a formal statement reiterating that the court confirmed the validity of the exclusive contracts and that the label had not neglected its management duties. 
The label shared that it has plans for NewJeans, including the release of a studio album, with ADOR calling for the artists to “calmly reflect on this matter.”
HYBE’s global communications shared ADOR’s statement early on October 30 to international press:
Represented by Shin & Kim LLC, the members of NewJeans released an immediate statement following the Seoul Central District Court’s first-instance decision. 
Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haerin, and Hyein remain adamant that it is “impossible to return to ADOR” and that trust between the group and label was “completely broken.” The NewJeans camp has signaled that it will continue to pursue the appellate process, while publicly thanking fans for their continued support.
The legal statement reads in full (provided via Soompi):
Markets reacted positively to the court decision with CNBC noting HYBE’s market value jumped by roughly $644 million and that shares rose as much as 7.12% within the day following the ruling. 
Thursday’s move shows that investors welcomed legal clarity, which keeps one of HYBE’s most commercially valuable acts under contract. However, the ruling does not resolve a visible internal company issue — a risk that could complicate promotions, fan sentiment, and long-term monetization if the relationship remains publicly strained. HYBE and ADOR’s ability to actually execute album and touring plans while the parties litigate and appeal will be a delicate balancing act for management and investors alike.
With NewJeans’ legal team stating that it will appeal the Seoul court’s ruling, the dispute is likely to continue, even as ADOR says it stands ready with scheduled releases and promotions. For HYBE, the immediate priority will be executing planned business activity around the act while containing reputational fallout from continued public disagreement between artist and label.
HYBE still has a packed schedule for many of its other artists before the end of the year. The label’s calendar includes NO LABELS: PART 01, the debut solo EP  from Tomorrow X Together member Yeonjun, a new single album Not Cute Anymore from girl group ILLIT, alongside releases from KATSEYE and more in the works. 2026 also looks to be a banner year for the company, as it has confirmed BTS’ highly awaited comeback for March, as well as new boy band and girl group projects with collaborators like Geffen Records, along with producer and OneRepublic star Ryan Tedder. 
HYBE’s stock is up more than 65% year-to-date."

Adobe’s stock (NASDAQ: ADBE) experienced a significant 6.1% single-day decrease yesterday, October 29, 2025.
This decline occurred despite numerous AI-focused product announcements at the company's annual MAX conference, suggesting investors remain worried about the long-term competitive impact of Artificial Intelligence on Adobe's business, alongside typical profit-taking.
Given this volatility and the surrounding market uncertainty, investors should carefully consider their position. Consider the following data:
While we appreciate buying dips when the fundamentals are favorable – for ADBE, refer to Buy or Sell ADBE Stock – we are cautious of falling knives. Specifically, it’s essential to contemplate if the situation worsens and ADBE declines another 20-30% to around $237, would we be able to retain the stock? What is the worst-case scenario? We refer to this as downturn resilience. It appears that the stock has performed worse than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. We evaluate this based on (a) the extent to which the stock fell and (b) the speed of its recovery.
Investing in a single stock can be risky; however, there is significant value in a wider, diversified strategy, as we implement with the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. This represents one way to evaluate stocks. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio considers many more factors and is specifically designed to mitigate stock-specific risk while providing upside potential.
Below are the specifics, but first, a brief overview: ADBE offers a variety of software solutions globally, including Creative Cloud subscriptions, catering to enterprise clients through its Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing & Advertising divisions.
 It is essential to consider how low ADBE might decline during a downturn. Additionally, you should assess how the stock performed relative to the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which contains 30 stocks and has consistently outperformed its benchmark, which includes the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. Why is that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; resulting in less volatility, as demonstrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics."
80,2025-10-30,"Strategy (MSTR), the largest corporate holder of bitcoin, reported net income of $2.8 billion, or EPS of $8.42 for the third quarter of 2025.
Led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, the company continued to execute its aggressive bitcoin accumulation strategy. Fueled by proceeds from common and preferred stock issuances, Strategy increased its holdings to 640,031 BTC by the end of September from 597,325 at the beginning of the quarter (October purchases have since brought the company stack to 640,808).
The third quarter profit came thanks to a rise in the price of bitcoin from roughly $107,000 at the beginning of July to about $114,000 at the end of September. Investors, however, weren't so kind to MSTR, which saw about a 14% decline in share price over those three months as the market cap premium over the value of its bitcoin holdings fell sharply (the mNAV).
It's a tumble that's accelerated during October, with shares plunging another 20% this month, including a 7.5% drop today alongside bitcoin's return to below $107,000.

The company's so-called bitcoin yield year-to-date is 26% and the firm reiterated guidance for full year bitcoin yield of 30% and net income of $24 billion, or $80 per share, based on its BTC price outlook of $150,000.
Strategy also re-included common stock ATM guidance at which it promised not to sell common shares when the mNAV falls below 2.5x. The company earlier this year had this guidance, but then pulled it, causing some consternation among shareholders.
MSTR's recent sharp share price decline relative to bitcoin has left its mNAV barely above 1, meaning common stock issuance is likely off the table for the foreseeable future.
Shares are up 3.3% in after hours trading with the earnings call beginning at 5 pm ET.

Social media listening goes beyond direct tags and mentions. See how to analyze conversations, find trends, and improve your overall strategy.
Have you ever entered a room and felt everyone was talking about you? That’s what your social media strategy can feel like without social listening.
The reality is people are talking about your brand and your industry — whether you’re in the (digital) room or not. They’re swapping product recommendations via Instagram Stories or sharing feedback using TikTok comments.
Paying attention to your direct mentions and tags is great — necessary, even — but it’s not enough if you want to hear more unfiltered thoughts directly from your audience. That’s where social listening comes in.
In this guide, I’ll break down what social listening is, how it differs from social monitoring, and how you can develop your own social listening strategy.
Social media listening is analyzing conversations about your brand across different platforms and using those insights to inform your strategy.
For example, let’s say you're a skincare brand and notice someone on X (formerly Twitter) posting about acne issues. You can hop in and recommend your products and how you can help. This is social media listening in action. It goes beyond responding to comments and staying on top of direct mentions — we’ll cover that in the next section.
Online, people often use the terms ""social media monitoring"" and ""social media listening"" interchangeably, but there’s a difference between the two.
“Monitoring tells you what people are saying to you. Listening reveals what they’re saying about you,” says social media consultant, Annie-Mai Hodge.
“Social media monitoring is the baseline: keeping track of direct mentions, tags, and messages so you can respond quickly. It’s important for customer care, but it only shows you what people say to you. Social listening is the bigger picture: analysing the full spectrum of conversations around your brand, your industry, and even cultural trends your audience cares about. It tells you not just what is being said, but why.”
Here’s a more accurate visual with examples that explains the difference between social monitoring and social listening:
Ultimately, social monitoring and social listening work hand-in-hand to form an effective strategy.
Your priority should be social monitoring. It’s essential to engage with the community you’ve already built first — respond to comments, direct messages (DMs), and posts that mention you. Once you’re comfortably doing that, add social media listening in the mix. You’ll find many social listening tools help you practice both monitoring and listening tasks seamlessly — more on that later.
Maybe you’re wondering whether social listening is a must-have in your social media strategy. Wouldn’t monitoring alone suffice? Here are five benefits of social listening that prove why it’s essential:
Think of social listening like tuning into a radio station where your audience is freely talking about your industry, products, and competitors. Through social listening, you can understand your audience’s struggles, how your product fits into their lives, and how to tweak your strategy to meet their needs.
“So many social conversations happen without brand mentions, which means if you’re only watching your @notifications, you’re missing the majority of valuable feedback and insight,” says Annie-Mai.
“That’s where social listening becomes more than monitoring because it’s about spotting early patterns in what customers are saying, identifying rising pain points or opportunities, and feeding that back into strategy.”
An excellent social listening example is the comics Johnny Wu creates at Vimcal — it’s a social media series about stories his audience shares with him anonymously. Because the content comes directly from his listening efforts (and he pairs it with eye-catching visuals), it feels authentic, fun, and engaging. 
With social listening, your progress will accelerate because your content and business will be rooted in actionable insights from your target audience.
Social listening plays a crucial role in maintaining brand reputation because customers are talking about your brand even if they don’t tag you explicitly. By skipping social listening, you miss out on customer feedback — whether that’s a complaint or positive feedback. You also miss the opportunity to provide a great customer experience.
When you have a social listening strategy, you’re also better prepared for crisis management. If you notice a negative conversation about your brand, you can jump right in and avert the crisis before it does too much damage.
Investing in social listening also indirectly helps increase customer advocacy — it gives your team a chance to provide support to your customers, even if your social media account isn’t tagged.
When you’ve tuned in to relevant conversations via social listening, you’ll be able to see two steps ahead. You’ll start to notice patterns, trends, and customer sentiment on a topic before everyone catches up. Think of it like a first-mover advantage.
For example, Sprite saw a jump in people using tea bags with their Sprite drink on social media platforms (specifically FoodTok). So, they launched a new product — Sprite + Tea — to meet consumer demand. 
“This was an organic, consumer-first insight,” says Kate Schaufelberger, Sprite’s North America brand director. “It just felt like a really ripe opportunity to listen to that consumer innovation idea as a foundation and jumping-off point.”
You can’t identify industry trends if you monitor conversations just within your social media account. You need to stretch the boundaries and hunt for relevant social media conversations beyond your own bubble. 
By conducting social listening regularly, you’re “in the know” of many social media conversations that pertain directly to your industry or product. This can help you create new products or improve existing ones, depending on consumer behavior.
For example, Cassey Ho, founder of Popflex Active, frequently shares stories on her social media posts about how she has improved her products based on sentiment analysis. 
A post shared by Cassey Ho (@blogilates)
My personal favorite story was when a customer highlighted that one of her tops can also be reversible — a discovery that was a surprise for Cassey herself. It changed how she marketed the product on her website and socials. Social listening magic, right here. 
A post shared by Cassey Ho (@blogilates)
Using social listening to launch new products or improve existing ones isn’t definitely step one. But when your social listening strategy has been in the works for a while, you can definitely expect a more direct impact on your business.
Social listening also includes competitive analysis, aka understanding how your target audience perceives your rivals. Doing this can help you take advantage of your strengths — you can adjust your marketing campaigns and launch new features your buyers need.
“When we noticed recurring Reddit threads about creators being frustrated with our competitor’s pricing, we built targeted campaigns around our migration tools and highlighted those in creator outreach,” says Tyler Denk, CEO of Beehiiv.
“Similarly, when people on X were asking how to get more subscribers without paying for ads, we doubled down on showcasing our Boosts product, which lets creators cross-promote and pay only for verified signups. These insights directly shape what features we promote, what guides we publish, and even how we adjust our onboarding flows.”
Tyler’s example is proof of how you can adjust your marketing messages using social listening — especially when your competitor drops a news that you can turn in your favor. We practiced this at Buffer ourselves when we leaned in on highlighting our free plan in our social media posts, right when our competitor shut down theirs. 😉
The benefits above have shown you how powerful social listening can be. But it’s one thing to talk and another thing to do.
An effective social listening strategy isn’t as complicated as you think. Instead of intensity, it’s rooted in consistency. You don’t need to spend hours crawling through different social media platforms to gain insights. All you need to do is work smart and use social media listening tools (if possible) to speed up the process.
Social listening can help you do a lot of things, as we discussed in the benefits section. But what is your priority? What is the number one thing you want to achieve via your social listening efforts?
Getting clear on your goals is important because it will dictate how you practice social listening and which conversations you monitor.
When you have clear goals attached to your strategy, you’ll also be able to report better on your social listening success. And once you’ve set goals, it’ll also make the next step easier and quicker.
All social media channels have search capabilities that can help you monitor relevant conversations and convert them to actionable insights. But it’s better to focus on a few, targeted keywords that match your goals to make the most of your time.
If you haven’t monitored the comment section on your social media posts in a while, start there.
“The easiest way to build social listening skills is to go beyond your own notifications. Start tracking keywords in your niche, notice the questions or frustrations people raise in comment sections, and pay attention to the language your audience actually uses,” says Annie-Maie.
“Over time, you’ll see patterns, and those insights can shape your content themes, your tone, and even the partnerships or products you prioritise.”
With Buffer’s Community feature, you can stay on top of comments — filter for unanswered ones to see the ones you haven’t read yet. And then click on “Insight” to power your comment section with AI — just ask Buffer’s AI assistant the top insights from your comments about consumer preferences and it’ll give you a nifty summary. (screenshot)
Investing in a social media management tool like Buffer is also beneficial for your customer advocacy team. They can easily filter for comments that are unanswered and reply to the ones that relate directly to a product.
Take this example from Vimcal — a customer brought up a feature request that already existed. By staying on top of mentions, the brand was able to respond quickly and offer a better customer experience. 
Love the time travel feature in @vimcal.Minor feature request -- wish I could do CMD-K --> CDT instead of CMD-K --> Time travel --> CDT
Once you’ve set up the proper system to respond to comments and DMs, move to a more proactive approach and shortlist the keywords/topics you’ll monitor on various social channels. These will be directly related to the goals you set in step one. For example:
I'm using beehiiv but Substack seems to have more options when it comes to actually creating your blog page + it's more of a community engagement writing platform than a newsletter platform.So I'd sayBeehiiv = newsletters only, but build your own landing since options are…
A post shared by YNAB | Live Spendfully (@ynab.official)
Remember to keep updating your social listening keywords library. Update it as time passes and your potential customers’ preferences change.
All major social platforms have search engines. But sifting through hundreds and thousands of posts to find a smidge of useful info can be back-breaking work — especially on top of all other social media tasks you’ve got on your plate already.
This is why it’s worth investing in the right social listening tools that can help you speed up online conversation tracking and gather valuable insights without shaving hours off the clock.
Here’s a list of my five favorite social listening tools — with options for free tools, too.
Remember many social media monitoring tools also offer plenty of features to practice social listening. If you’re just beginning to implement social listening in your strategy, monitoring tools might be more than enough. As you start to see more results from your social listening strategy, you can move to dedicated social listening software.
Social listening platforms can help you spot negative sentiment, valuable insights, and industry trends. But actively listening also means converting this data into meaningful material that you can actually use in your strategy and business.
The first step is analyzing the data. Many social listening tools will do this task for you — they’ll highlight the posts mentioning any negative feedback, provide a brand reputation score, etc. But supplement this with manual analysis because software alone can’t grasp all the intricacies.
For example, when a tool collates all posts related to a keyword you targeted, go through the content and identify patterns. Are posts with a common theme gaining more traction than others? Are there repeated complaints about a feature? Are people suddenly talking about a new trending topic? This extra layer of human insight converts your analysis from raw data into meaningful findings. 
Once you’ve analyzed the data and discovered insightful patterns, the next step is to identify actionable takeaways that you can implement. For example:
The last thing you want to do is to let your invaluable social listening insights collect dust. You want to use them to make impactful, data-driven decisions.
A great example here is the haircare brand Fix My Curls. They received a lot of customer feedback about their unattractive packaging, so they took it to heart and brushed up their product design. 
A post shared by Fix My Curls ➰ Curly and Wavy Hair Care (@fiixmycurls)
“Sometimes, social listening might help in highlighting product issues that need to be addressed quickly. And other times, it could surface the language customers are naturally using so you can reflect that in campaigns,” says Annie-Mai.
“The end goal is always the same: to turn passive conversations into active intelligence that shapes content, community management, and even wider brand decisions.”
Social listening data is invaluable, no doubt about it. But you’ll be surprised at how much you can unearth just by digging deeper into your own social media analytics and paying attention to your comments and DMs. If you’re behind on engaging with your followers, that’s where you should begin.
And if you’re struggling to stay on top of conversations already happening in your social media accounts, I hear you. Use tools like Buffer to help you schedule posts, analyze your performance, and engage with your audience. Let it automate the manual but necessary evil tasks so you can focus on what makes the most difference: listening to your audience.

87,2025-10-30,"The OnePlus 15 is the most durable consumer phone on the market today.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Best answer: The OnePlus 15 isn't just water-resistant, it's arguably the most durable phone you'll find on the market right now. It meets the usual IP68 certification for both dust and water resistance, as well as IP66, IP69, and IP69K, which confirms resistance to higher temperatures and high-pressure water jets as well. With that said, there are still precautions you should take when using it near or even in water.

Why you can trust Android Central




Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.

 



The OnePlus 15 has launched in China and is coming to North America soon. Like its predecessor, the OnePlus 13, the phone boasts both an IP68 and IP69 dust and water resistance rating. The IP68 rating confirms that it's dust-tight, able to withstand exposure to even small dust particles. It also signifies protection against water submersion up to two meters for up to 30 minutes. The industry standard, OnePlus notes, is about 1.5 meters. This means you can take a dip in the pool, use it in the bathtub, or even ignore any worry if it accidentally falls into the toilet and you need to rinse it off.
The IP69 rating indicates protection against high-pressure water jets up to 176°F (80°C) from any direction. So, take it out on the boat while jet skiing, out during a heavy rainstorm, or even have it in your hand while partaking in an epic water hose fight. During a demo at the OnePlus 13 launch event, OnePlus even showed us how the phone could run through a top-rack dishwasher cycle and come out unscathed. Though we wouldn't recommend it, it's a testament to the phone's durability and water resistance.
What do the other ratings mean? The IP66 rating simply means it's protected against water jets from any direction, including those that are not high-pressure nor high-temperature. So, cold-water jets from a faucet, for example, should be fine.
IP69K, meanwhile, is the highest IP standard possible. The 9K refers to high-pressure, high-temperature jets from any direction, including at close range. The ""K"" simply confirms that OnePlus has tested the phone under very specific conditions. To put this in perspective, close-range, high-temperature, high-pressure water jets are similar to what you'd experience at a car wash.
 



As with any water-resistant device, there are a few things to note when understanding Ingress Protection (IP) ratings. These pertain to freshwater sources, including your tap water at home, rainwater, and even a pool. However, it does not include salt water, as salt can corrode electronics. If you're swimming in the ocean, then it's best to leave this phone — or any piece of electronics, for that matter — back at your beach chairs.
Take chlorine into account as well. If you're at a public indoor pool swimming in very heavily chlorinated water, you might want to proceed with caution. The phone should be fine, especially if you rinse and dry it off after a dunk. But keep this in mind. Because of the resistance to high temperatures and water jets, however, go ahead and bring it into the hot tub, even down that water slide (as long as you have it safely secured to you!)
One more thing to note is that water-resistance ratings on any device degrade over time. As the phone ages, it won't retain the same level of water resistance. With that said, try to keep it away from water sources when it isn't necessary (of course, don't hesitate to take those in-pool and water-gun-fight photos) and protect it with a case. But if it takes a dunk with you, you want to take underwater pictures, or you need to rinse it off after getting sand on it at the beach, go ahead.
This phone is arguably the most durable consumer-level phone available today and easily overtakes the OnePlus 13 as the best waterproof phone right now.
 




Ultimate durability
The OnePlus 15, currently available in China and coming soon to North America, offers the ultimate in durability. It sports the highest possible IP rating for protecting against fine dust particles, water immersion, and even high-pressure and high heat water jets. A dip in the pool, night out in the rain, even a wash through the top rack dishwasher cycle, is no match for this phone.

This as-told-to essay is based on a Wednesday evening conversation with Jordan Senior, 36, a rental-property owner and operator in Treasure Beach, Jamaica. It has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified the financial details in this story.
I'm family with most people in Treasure Beach, Jamaica. I've lived here for years, and I work in the hospitality industry, running short-term rentals.
As a Jamaican local, I'm no stranger to hurricanes. I was here during Hurricane Ivan. I was here for Beryl in 2024. I lost the roof on my home during Beryl.
We were stressed about Hurricane Melissa. Authorities told us it would be a Category Five hurricane.
They said, ""We've never had a hurricane like this before. It's going to wreck the place. Prepare, prepare, prepare.""
When it finally arrived, it wasn't the worst I've lived through, but it was rough. I sheltered at home with my wife, and the wind and rain were so strong that we couldn't see anything.
Outside our window, it was all just white — a white spray of water everywhere.
When it died down, I took stock of the rental cabin that is my primary source of income. It is just a short distance from my home, and the flooding around it was the worst I've ever seen.
I built Cashaw Cabin, a one-bedroom A-frame cabin with a private pool five minutes from Treasure Beach, in 2022 and opened it for business in 2023. I invested about $40,000 in the property.
It has a small kitchenette, a full bathroom, a patio, a back garden, and a plunge pool, and is perfect for two people.
Across the year, it's booked about 15 to 20 nights a month, but from mid-November to May, it's booked out almost every night.
I rent it for about $115 to $150 per night, depending on the time of the year, on platforms like Airbnb, Booking.com, and Expedia. Apart from my photography gig, it's my primary source of income, and I earn around $30,000 yearly from it.
Guests have described it as rustic chic and said they felt like they were on an island by themselves in the cabin.
After Hurricane Melissa, it looks like it's been submerged in the sea.
The flooding is up to my knee, and it's impossible to enter the cabin. The landscaping has been wiped clean.
The water is slowly going down, so I just have to wait and see. But I don't think I will be in a position to reopen it to guests for at least a month and a half, maybe even January.
Airbnb has canceled my bookings. I understand, that's no problem, they have to look after people.
But at the same time, maybe the host needs some help, too. If you're canceling bookings months after a storm, that doesn't really work out for the hosts because we don't have anything to look forward to in terms of earnings.
I'm trying to get this thing ready so I can host again as soon as possible.
I was using the earnings from Cashaw Cabin to partially fund another construction project, a two-bedroom villa. It was almost ready to start operations. If not for the hurricane, it would have been up in a couple of weeks.
This villa and two other properties I'm building have cost me about $60,000, which I've funded from my savings and with a family investor.
The unit is largely destroyed. The frame is still there, but the roof is gone, and something hit the wall and smashed it up. So that has to be repaired again, because all the work that's already been done has been annihilated.
The money I was going to spend on the final touches on the property and its launch will now have to be used for repair work. I'll have to dip even further into my savings now.
Physically, I'm OK. Mentally, I'm exhausted.

Representatives for Airbnb, Booking.com, and Expedia did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.
Airbnb has a major disruptive events policy that guides how it handles cancellations and refunds. Hurricanes in the Caribbean Sea are in its list of ""most common foreseeable weather events."" Affected Airbnb hosts in the region can cancel reservations without paying fees, per Airbnb's website.
In a press release on Wednesday, Airbnb said it would offer free emergency housing for Hurricane Melissa first responders in affected Caribbean countries, including Jamaica.

Duolingo (DUOL) has been a top performer in edtech, but after a strong run, the stock is losing momentum. The recent drop raises a key question for investors: is this a healthy pullback or the start of a deeper correction?
The stock has declined by 21.5% in less than a month, dropping from $347.27 on 10/8/2025 to its current price of $272.76. What lies ahead? It appears that the stock may decrease further. The existing correction, when contextualized with the stock's Very High valuation, indicates the potential for more downside. A price of $192 is not beyond possibility, particularly given that the stock has reached this level at least once in the past 5 years.
Therefore, should you delay your purchase before taking advantage of this dip? Perhaps. Timing dips perfectly is not an exact science. Still, here is another viewpoint on DUOL stock that may assist you in making your decision. The stock has historically returned a median of 87% in one year, and has produced 87% as its peak return after significant dips (>30% in 30 days). For a brief overview, DUOL offers a language-learning platform featuring courses in 40 languages, accessible via both website and mobile app, primarily catering to users in the U.S. and China.
For more information on stock fundamentals and assessments: Read Buy or Sell Duolingo Stock to gain a comprehensive understanding. Investing in a single stock may involve risks, but adopting a broader, diversified strategy holds substantial advantages. Proper asset allocation and diversification can maintain your investment journey. Were you aware that investors who panicked and exited the S&P in 2020 missed out on considerable growth afterwards? Trefis offers a High Quality Portfolio and a proof-based asset management approach designed to minimize volatility, enabling you to stick with your strategy.

93,2025-10-30,"Apple held its earnings call for the fourth fiscal quarter (third calendar quarter) of 2025 today. With quarterly revenue of $102.5 billion, Apple set a new September quarter revenue record, beating analyst expectations. Apple CEO Tim Cook and Apple CFO Kevan Parekh provided insight into iPhone sales, holiday quarter expectations, and more.
We've rounded up the most interesting takeaways from the call.

Cook said that demand for the iPhone 17 models is ""off the chart."" Traffic in stores is up significantly, and Cook said that consumer reception is ""very strong."" Apple set a September quarter record for upgraders.
‌iPhone‌ supply was constrained during the quarter, and several ‌iPhone 17‌ models are still constrained. Cook said Apple is working hard to fulfill all the orders that it has.
When asked why the ‌iPhone 17‌ was doing so well, Cook said the following:

I think it's all about the product. The product lineup is incredibly strong or strong as ever. The 17 Pro is the most pro phone we've ever done. It's incredible. And the design sings. The iPhone air feels so thin and so light in your hand, it feels like it's going to fly away. And then the 17 phone is an incredible value, and takes several of the features that were reserved for pro before and brings them down to the consumer lineup. So overall, strongest iPhone lineup ever, and it's resonating around the world.

Though Apple refreshed the iPad lineup with the iPad Pro, many other iPads haven't had an update as of late. ‌iPad‌ sales were flat, with $6.95 billion in revenue.
Half of customers who purchased an ‌iPad‌ during the quarter were new to the product.

Mac sales were up, thanks to the launch of new MacBook Air models this year. Mac revenue was $8.7 billion, up from $7.7 billion last year. The Mac install base reached a new all-time high.
Apple said next quarter's Mac sales won't be as impressive because of an ""extremely difficult compare."" Last year, Apple launched several Macs late in the year, but this year the company only released the M5 MacBook Pro.

Apple's wearables category includes the Apple Watch and Vision Pro. Sales were slightly down at $9.01 billion compared to $9.04 billion last year.

Apple's Services segment hit a new all-time revenue record, reaching $28.8 billion, up from $25 billion in the year-ago quarter.
Services set revenue records in Americas, Europe, Japan, Rest of Asia Pacific, and a September quarter record in Greater China. Payment services hit an all-time revenue record and there was double-digit growth on Apple Pay active users.
Services revenue has surpassed $100 billion for the year, up 14 percent.

Apple is still on track to release an upgraded version of Siri next year, according to Cook. Apple is also planning for more partnerships like the ChatGPT integration in Apple Intelligence.

Parekh said that Apple is ""significantly increasing"" its investments in AI, with operating expenses between $18.1 and $18.5 billion expected.
Cook said that Apple is continuing to develop its Apple foundation models, and several are in development. But he also said that Apple continually looks at the market and is open to pursuing an acquisition if it will advance the company's roadmap.

Despite strong ‌iPhone‌ sales, revenue in China was down significantly. Cook said that China is expected to return to growth in the December quarter because of the reception to the ‌iPhone 17‌.
Revenue in China was $14.5 billion, down from $15 billion last year, and below analyst expectations of approximately $16.4 billion.

Apple said that it had $1.1 billion in tariff-related costs in Q4 2025. Apple expects $1.4 billion in tariff-related costs next quarter, assuming that nothing changes. It does include the recent tariff change on goods imported from China, which dropped to 10 percent from 20 percent.

Apple CEO ‌Tim Cook‌ said that total company revenue would grow 10 to 12 percent year over year in the December quarter. ‌iPhone‌ revenue is expected to grow double digits, and Apple is projecting that it will have its best December quarter ever.

American Airlines is reviving a type of flying it hasn't done in years: long-haul trips on single-aisle jets.
The carrier took delivery of its first Airbus A321XLR in October — a new narrowbody plane built specifically for long-distance routes.
With an extra fuel tank, the jet can fly about 5,400 miles, or up to 11 hours nonstop, while burning less fuel than previous-generation options.
American will first use the A321XLR on a domestic transcontinental route in December. But its long-haul debut comes on March 8, when the airline launches seasonal service between New York and Edinburgh, Scotland, through October 24.
Tickets go on sale November 3. Pricing isn't yet public for the Edinburgh route, but roundtrip fares on the A321XLR's first route, New York to Los Angeles, start at about $750 in economy and around $3,000 in business class in December.
American last flew a narrowbody across the Atlantic in 2019, relying on the Boeing 757. The plane's eventual retirement, accelerated by the pandemic, was due to high fuel and maintenance costs.
The A321XLR is meant to fix the efficiency issue for American — and the airline has configured it for long-haul comfort.
Customers can expect a premium-heavy cabin, including lie-flat business-class seats and a dedicated premium economy section. The amenities include hot meals for all 155 passengers, with upgraded dining and amenities up front.
The Edinburgh route will complement American's existing widebody service from Philadelphia, while adding to a growing list of seasonal transatlantic flights such as Prague and Budapest next summer — those still scheduled on larger aircraft.
Edinburgh is just the first stop on the A321XLR's expected European tour.
The A321XLR is designed for long, thin routes: City pairs that don't have enough demand for a widebody but are too far for existing narrowbodies to fly comfortably and economically — like Charlotte to Venice or Milan. That opens new possibilities on both sides of the Atlantic.
The move aligns with a broader industry shift of airlines sending narrowbodies across the Atlantic. And that's significant for American, after it had largely ceded the market to rivals but is now leaning back in.
Data from aviation analytics firm Cirium show that American, Delta, and United flew about 10,000 long-haul narrowbody flights in 2019 — all on 757s.
This type of flying tapered off through the mid-2010s as the 757 grew less efficient, and the pandemic nearly halted international travel in 2020.
But, with the rising popularity of Airbus' long-haul narrowbodies, JetBlue revived the trend in 2021, flying its 4,600-mile-range A321LR to cities such as London, Paris, and Amsterdam. Like American, its planes feature a premium-heavy cabin.
That move let JetBlue enter major business markets without investing in a widebody fleet — planes with two aisles that are far more expensive to build and operate and harder to fill consistently in competitive markets.
In 2025, Delta, United, and JetBlue are scheduled to operate more than 14,000 long-haul narrowbody flights, per Cirium. That number is only expected to increase as American joins the mix in 2026.
United Airlines, for its part, has doubled down on the strategy — using Boeing 757s and 737 Max jets to connect the US to smaller leisure European destinations, like Ponta Delgada in the Azores, Portugal, and Tenerife, Spain.
The airline plans to soon replace many of those 757s with its own A321XLRs.
It has also signaled interest in opening more niche transatlantic markets with the aircraft. That could mean new nonstop options from the US East Coast to places like West Africa or Northern Italy — spots that previously required a connection.
In other words, more single-aisle planes are now capable of crossing oceans — and that's reshaping how people fly long-haul.
Delta has been the outlier, scaling back 757 transatlantic flying and relying more heavily on widebodies. It remains the only major US carrier that has not ordered the A321XLR.

The Ministry of Commerce’s Q&A with reporters included a concise outline of the Trump-Xi meeting per their spokesperson:
In addition, the two sides also reached a consensus on fentanyl anti-drug cooperation, the expansion of the agricultural product trade, and the handling of relevant cases involving enterprises. The two sides further confirmed the results of the Madrid economic and trade consultations, and the United States made positive commitments in investment and other fields. China will properly resolve the relevant issues related to TikTok with the United States.
Asian equities were lower as investors recalibrated the potential for no December US Fed cut, as the US dollar strengthened overnight.
President Trump and President Xi had many positive things to say about their meeting, as today’s agreement met the market’s base forecast. We should assume dialogue will continue with the potential for a bigger, beautiful trade deal when President Trump visits China early next year. 
Hong Kong volumes were very high, at 147% of the 1-year average, as markets faded in the afternoon, as the Hang Seng could close above 26,500, though stayed above 26,000. The Hang Seng Tech Index also closed above the 6,000 level. Despite a very large buy of the Hong Kong Tracker ETF from Mainland investors via Southbound Stock Connect, Connect trading accounted for only 22% of Hong Kong turnover today. This may indicate underweight foreign investors were getting involved in growth favorites, as battery giant CATL gained +2.5% and internet stocks outperformed, including Tencent, which gained +0.9%, Alibaba, which gained +0.6%, and Meituan, which gained +2.4%. It is interesting that Hong Kong-listed technology hardware stocks were off, as they could be a beneficiary of better US-China trade relations. However, one explanation was ZTE falling -11.4% after missing Q3 analyst expectations significantly. We had a similar situation in Hong Kong-listed healthcare stocks, which were off. Meanwhile, defensive non-ferrous metals stocks, which include precious metals and miners, had a strong day.
A similar situation occurred on the Mainland, as tech hardware, semiconductors, and healthcare were lower. Perhaps some profit-taking as a form of insurance, given that capital markets were also off. Yesterday we spoke about Longi Green Energy and whether their Q3 results would provide insight into the anti-involution solar campaign. Post close, the company reported Q3 net loss declined YoY to RMB -834MM from Q2 2025’s loss of RMB -1.13B and Q3 2024’s loss of RMB -1.26B. Distressed SOE real estate developer Vanke reported that after the close, Q3 operating revenue declined -27.3% YoY, while Q3 net loss increased to RMB 16B from RMB 8B YoY. Post-close, LXJM announced that its Q3 net profit increased by +32.49% YoY to RMB 4.874B. Hong Kong cut interest rates by 25bps following the US Fed due to the currency peg.

97,2025-10-30,"WPP issued its second profit warning this year on Thursday after reporting worse-than-expected Q3 results. 
Following her first earnings call at the helm of the advertising giant, new CEO Cindy Rose said WPP’s financial performance “is certainly not where it needs to be” on a call with press Thursday—and she promised a plan to fix it. 
“My ambition for WPP is sky-high, and we are committed to doing the hard work it will take to turn this business around,” she said.
Key pillars of her roadmap include simplification, competitive pricing, and, of course, AI.
“We haven’t gone far enough or fast enough in adapting to the evolving needs of our clients,” Rose told reporters. “They want our offer to be simpler, more integrated, powered by media, data, and AI, efficiently priced and designed to deliver growth and business outcomes. You can expect us, in our effort to improve our execution, to be focused in those areas.” 
To revamp the business to meet these demands, focus areas in the coming months will include client acquisition and retention, strengthening the go-to-market strategy, and optimizing WPP’s org chart while “building a high performance team culture,” Rose said. 
The company is also evaluating ways to expand its addressable market through the potential integration or development of additional enterprise tech solutions, though Rose declined to go into specifics. 
The former Microsoft exec took the reins at the British advertising behemoth last month, with Mark Read exiting after a tumultuous seven-year stint in the role. 
WPP has suffered hit after hit this year, with investors losing confidence amid a messy reorg of its media division, AI acceleration challenges, and a spate of high-profile client departures—with both Coca-Cola and Mars migrating their media accounts to French rival Publicis.
Rose has hit the ground running in her first two months in the role. She’s overseen a leadership reshuffle and inked a deal with Google that includes a $400 million pledge from WPP to integrate the tech giant’s advanced AI tools into WPP Open, its AI marketing platform. Last week, WPP launched a self-serve version of WPP Open to court dollars from small businesses and performance marketers. 
The company expects WPP Open Pro, and WPP Open more broadly, to drive much-needed revenue. Rose views the platform’s underlying common data model as a key differentiator among agency AI solutions, noting that it helps clients “optimize their entire marketing investment across the entire marketing function.”
Of these recent developments, Rose said: “These are all bold and decisive moves that hopefully give you a sense of our direction of travel, and you can certainly expect more of the same from us in the months ahead.”
“We need to go farther and we need to go faster,” she added. 
As WPP pours resources into its AI programs, another priority will be to revitalize WPP Media, rebranded earlier this year from GroupM. In Rose’s view: “GroupM lost its way, but I’m very confident in [CEO] Brian [Lesser]’s vision of an open and privacy-compliant data- and AI-powered ecosystem.” 
The media buyer saw signs of growth in Q3, snagging new business from Mastercard, logistics titan Maersk, and retailer Marks & Spencer.
WPP said it will share a more comprehensive strategy plan publicly in the coming year. 
Despite its financial woes, Rose signaled confidence in the firm’s direction.
“We’ve got strong foundations, and we’ve got the ingredients we need to succeed, including amazing clients, strong capabilities, world-class talent, and some of the most consequential agency brands in the world,” she said. “We have unrivaled global scale and reach, market-leading technology and technology partnerships that really give us a competitive edge, and all of that makes this a very exciting platform for us to build on.”

	With TV industry events increasingly leaning into the creator economy, next week’s Digital Content Forum will see new and established players take stock as the entertainment business faces a reset.

	The London event is in its fourth edition and has established itself as a space for digital-first creators and studios. As MIPCOM attendees witnessed earlier this month, the traditional media giants are also pushing hard into the creator economy as legacy business models start to look stretched and YouTube viewing becomes the norm.

	“They’re really leaning into this test-and-learn sensibility we see in the digital-first market, and starting to understand what acting like a creator means for an established media business,” says DCF founder Justin Crosby. “Fox Entertainment was really good example of that when they invested in Holywater. You’ve seen ITV Studios with Zoom 55, which they’ve launched a year ago, and Hearst, with the launch of [YouTube-focused division] Hearst Canvas.”

	The news and docs space is also undergoing rapid change, with newly appointed SWNS Media CEO, and Barcroft Media founder, Sam Barcroft running a session on the future of news at the DCF.




			Watch on Deadline		






	“News is a new area we’ll be highlighting this time with Sky, ITN and The Sun and you’ve got legacy companies building digital-first studios,” Crosby said. “They are starting to play in the world of documentary as well, and to test different video formats for news, which is really important for the whole aspect of truth and authentic reporting and storytelling.”

Steven Bartlett’s creator business secured an eight-figure investment this week and the ‘Diary Of A CEO’ podcaster said he wants “to build the Disney of the creator economy”. Georgie Holt from his Flight Story business will be speaking at DCF. The Sidemen’s business has also staffed up and received an injection of capital in recent weeks and Victor Bengtsson, Managing Director of the Sidemen’s entertainment operations will also be in town. A session homing in on the rise of the creator collective will have speakers from YouTube, The Fellas Studio, recently acquired by Global, and Upload, the management agency for Beta Squad.

	










	Elsewhere, former BBC Studios exec Matt Ford will be speaking publicly for the first time since joining Sony Pictures earlier this year where he was handed a remit to “engage with UK content creators, create digital originals and build creator partnerships.” 

	Digital formats will be in focus with The Wit giving a global view of what’s working and where, and Deadline will host a session on the world of micro-dramas analyzing whether the hype around vertical drama matches the reality.

	“The event is really a meeting point between the established TV industry and the digital-first space,” Crosby said. “And there are lots of opportunities for traditional TV companies to look at digital formats and creators. And that’s the point and that’s really our overall theme.”

Shares of Hims & Hers Health (HIMS) are headed for their fourth-straight daily drop, down 2.4% to trade at $45.53 at last check, as investors look ahead to the company’s third quarter results, due out after the close Monday, Nov. 3. Since hitting a February record high of $72.98, the stock has staged several rallies that have run out of steam around $65. The recent pullback has HIMS nearing a historically bullish trendline, however, meaning another short-term bounce could be imminent. 
Per Schaeffer’s Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, the equity is within 0.75 of the 200-day moving average's 20-day average true range (ATR), after spending at least 80% of the last 10 days above this trendline. This has happened four other times over the last three years, after which the stock was higher one month later three times, averaging an 18.2% gain. A move of similar magnitude from the equity’s current perch would put it back near $51.45.
Historically, Hims & Hers stock has a split history of post-earnings moves. The equity finished lower after four of its last eight reports, including a 12.4% drop in August. The stock has averaged a next-day swing of 13.3%, regardless of direction. This time around, investors are pricing in a higher 17.1% move.
Analysts are extremely pessimistic, with 11 of 14 in coverage sporting a “hold” or worse rating. In other words, there is plenty of room for upgrades, should this bearish sentiment begin to unwind. 
More good news for prospective buyers is that HIMS tends to outperform options traders’ volatility expectations. This is per its Schaeffer's Volatility Scorecard (SVS) of 80 (out of 100)."
