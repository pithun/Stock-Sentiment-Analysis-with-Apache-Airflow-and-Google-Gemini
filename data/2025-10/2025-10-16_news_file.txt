EcoFlow built its reputation on one device: the Delta 2. It became the goâto power station for campers and anyone who needed quick and reliable energy without the fumes or noise of a gas generator. Now that the newer Delta 3 is out, EcoFlow is clearing out stock and Amazon has dropped the 1800W Delta 2 to its lowest price ever: ThisÂ bestâseller is down to $429, from its original $699, a record low 39% discount that makes it handsâdown the smartest buy of the season if youâve been considering portable power for home backup or outdoor adventures.

Although the Delta 3 has some improvements, the Delta 2 still meets the same sweet spot in terms of power, speed, and reliability all at a significantly lower price. With a 1024Wh capacity and peak output of 1800W, the station can power most household devices, tools, or entertainment equipment. Consider mini-fridges, coffee machines, gaming stations, and even hairdryers – this little hulk powers up to 90% of the things we all use daily.
The outdoors enthusiast also relishes the dual purpose of the Delta 2 as a solar generator with up to 500W solar input capability: You can pair it with matching panels (sold separately) and charge green while camping or off-grid. It’s the perfect configuration for RV power, work anywhere, or charging devices in an environmentally friendly manner. What’s more, its minimum base level 1kWh capacity can be increased easily with addâon batteries up to 3kWh: That versatility converts the Delta 2 from a weekend camping friend into a serious residential backup solution.
If you’ve been waiting to commit to the EcoFlow ecosystem, this deal can’t be missed. The Delta 2 still houses the same high-end performance that brought the brand into the spotlight and for $429, it’s darn close to a steal. Once inventory dies off, the price isn’t returning this low at least for some time.

Most of us would welcome a soothing massage before bed after a long day, but booking regular professional sessions can be expensive, and most medication out there doesnât exactly provide that instant relief your feet are looking for. This is where the EMSense Triple Therapy foot massager can help, and if you act fast, you can snag it for significantly less than its retail price.
This at-home, effective solution offers professional-grade foot therapy and is available at a massive 60% discount right now, meaning you can grab it for just $37 instead of $81. The only catch? The discount ends today, so you only have a few hours left to save.

This is a non-invasive, drug-free pain relief solution developed by a team of medical specialists. âTriple therapyâ means that it combines three key methods to deliver the promised results; warming heat technology to increase the temperature of your feet, massaging to improve the overall blood flow, and compression for that therapeutic support that feels comforting. It specifically targets burning, tingling, numbness, and fatigue, and isnât really a short-term quick fix. According to the brand, consistent use of EMSense can support long-term nerve recovery.
There are no side effects, and itâs quite easy to use at home. To get started, slide your feet into the massager and wrap it around your feet. The adjustable straps let you pick a comfortable fit.

I've always been a Target girl at heart — but when it comes to groceries, I've often turned to Walmart. 
Given the latter's reputation for offering ""everyday low prices,"" I've long assumed I'd save more money getting my essentials there. But to be fair, it's been a while since I've taken a close look at both stores' price tags. 
So, I recently decided to put both big-box retailers to the test. 
I visited my local Target and Walmart in Central Florida on the same Thursday afternoon, with plans to spend about $100 in each store on groceries and essential items that my family uses most.
Here's how my shopping experiences stacked up.
My kids love snacking on fresh fruit, so we go through a lot of produce-aisle staples, like grapes and strawberries, in my house. 
Both stores offered similar prices on the fruit we're known to stock up on, but Walmart's were typically cheaper. 
A pound of strawberries cost me $2.32 at Walmart, but would've been over $3 at Target. I found green grapes for $1.74 a pound at Walmart. At Target, they cost about $2.40 a pound. 
The produce seemed fresh and high-quality at both places, so Walmart will probably stay my go-to store for my kids' favorite fruits going forward.
Soda and sparkling water are two must-haves in our house, so I was sure to check the prices at both Target and Walmart. Once again, they were lower at the latter. 
The eight-packs of Bubly sparkling water we purchase most often were $3.97 each at Walmart and $4.39 at Target. A 12-pack of our favorite Barq's root beer costs $6.86 at Walmart, but $8.39 at Target. 
Aside from fruit and drinks, I didn't find huge price differences between most staples we purchase every week. 
Walmart's Great Value brand white sandwich bread was $1.42 per lof, and Target's Market Pantry white bread was $1.50, for example. 
I found 24-ounce jars of Rao's marinara for $6.89 at Target and $6.88 at Walmart. Though varieties differed, similar Old El Paso taco kits were available for under $4 at Walmart and Target.
My teens' go-to snacks were similarly priced at both stores, too. 
Both Walmart's Great Value and Target's Market Pantry offered boxes of 18 to 24 chewy granola bars that came out to about 16 or 17 cents per bar. 
Several bags of my kids' beloved kettle-style potato chips from brands like Cape Cod and Lay's were all under $4. When I crunched the numbers, the chip bags from Walmart tended to be a a cent or two cheaper per ounce.
Items like Premier protein shakes, my son's go-to breakfast before work or school, were just under $10 for a four-pack at both stores. Though, at Walmart, they cost one cent less.
I snack on Noosa yogurts every day, and find they do't often go on sale. They were $1.99 each at Target and $1.98 each at Walmart, so I grabbed a few at each store. 
Both locations carried my go-to flavors like blueberry and lemon, but Walmart had a seasonal pumpkin variety I was sure to pick up. 
I noticed plenty of deals and sales on other popular yogurt brands (like Dannon and Yoplait) at both chains, too. 
On the day I shopped, Walmart was the spot for yellow-stickered markdowns on many groceries, from meat to heat-and-serve meals to produce.
I got a 2-¼ -pound package of ground beef discounted to under $14 — a $3 savings. I use ground beef for weeknight meals like tacos and spaghetti, so I was happy to save on something I usually buy anyway. 
I didn't spot any of these markdowns on groceries during my Target trip, but, to be fair, I've seen many on previous visits. 
This could simply be due to when I visited. In my experience, it's a good idea to ask associates which days of the week your specific store marks down products that have to sell fast.
If you plan your shopping trips around those deals, you can stock your freezer and save big.
On grocery-shopping trips, I also restock our other household staples.
To save money, I usually try to buy items from Walmart and Target's store brands. They're often cheaper than similar offerings from bigger labels, though they can vary in quality. 
Generally, I prefer to purchase paper products from Target's Up & Up instead of Walmart's Great Value brands. In my experience, Walmart's store-brand paper towels aren't nearly as sturdy, despite costing around the same price as those from Target. 
I found great deals on store-brand laundry items at both Walmart and Target. 
Both chains had its own version of Oxiclean stain remover for a few cents less per ounce than the name brand. I also found Target's Up & Up and Walmart's Great Value fabric softeners were cheaper than similar name brands and came to roughly the same price per load.
When prices are so similar, I still prefer to buy store-brand household basics from Target. I've yet to purchase an Up & Up dupe that wasn't as good as the national brand.
At around noon on a Thursday, my Walmart store felt incredibly crowded, to the point where it was hard to push my cart down each aisle without running into another shopper. 
I spotted a lot of employees in the aisles stocking shelves, which only added to the stressful feeling of having to navigate a crowded store while checking off items on my grocery list.
I wasn't surprised, though, since many of my shopping trips to Walmart tend to feel this way, regardless of the time of day I visit. 
I usually have a more pleasurable experience shopping at Target than Walmart, and this trip was no exception.
The store felt fairly empty and spacious — I didn't encounter any employees partially blocking aisles to stock shelves or many shoppers on this Thursday afternoon.
My experience at each store seemed on par with the broader trend I've been reading about: Target's foot traffic has fallen this year while Walmart's has stayed steady. 
All in all, I spent just over $100 on similar hauls of essentials at both Target and Walmart. Honestly, I was surprised by how many products my family buys on a nearly weekly basis cost about the same at both stores.
Though I took advantage of a few solid deals at Walmart, my savings weren't significant enough to impress me. On some products, I only saved one cent. 
Sure, minor savings add up over time — but personally, I'd pay a little more just to have a less stressful shopping experience at Target. Plus, I typically prefer its store-brand household goods over Walmart's. 
Fortunately, though, I don't really have to choose between the stores because I have both Walmart+ and Target Circle 360 memberships that allow me to get my orders delivered. 
This makes it easier for me to snag the best deals and choose my preferred products without having to drive to two different stores. I plan to continue ordering from both retailers on a regular basis for convenience — especially since sales and product availability can vary.

5,2025-10-16,"India's goods exports to the US, its largest foreign market, dropped sharply by 20% in September and nearly 40% in the last four months, as Trump's steep tariffs took effect, data shows. 
September was the first full month of Washington's 50% tariffs on Indian goods, which kicked in on 27 August. This includes a 25% penalty for Delhi's refusal to stop buying oil from Russia. 
""US has become India's most severely affected market since the tariff escalation began,"" said Ajay Srivastava of Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a Delhi-based think tank.
Negotiations for a trade deal between the two countries are under way, with the goal of concluding an agreement by next month.
According to GTRI, the most significant impact of the tariffs has been felt by labour-heavy sectors such as textiles, gems and jewellery, engineering goods, and chemicals, which have suffered the heaviest losses. 
Shipments to the US have seen four consecutive months of decline, and are down 37.5% - from $8.8bn (£6.5bn) in May to $5.5bn in September. 
The drop in exports have also contributed to India's trade deficit (the gap between what a country imports and exports), which widened to a 13-month high of $32.15 billion in September. 
Some of the reduction in exports to the US was cushioned by improved trade with countries like the UAE and China. 
Trade negotiations between India and the US resumed last month after months of stalling over a number of differences. An Indian delegation is currently in the US for  talks.
On Wednesday, Trump said that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has agreed to stop buying Russian oil, as the US seeks to put economic pressure on the Kremlin as part of efforts to end the war in Ukraine. 
A spokesperson of the Indian foreign ministry said discussions were ""ongoing"" with the US administration which had ""shown interest in deepening energy co-operation with India"".
But major sticking points over trade still remain, including access to agriculture and dairy. 
For years, Washington has pushed for greater access to India's farm sector, seeing it as a major untapped market. But India has fiercely protected it, citing food security, livelihoods and the interests of millions of small farmers.
Until recently, the US was India's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching $190bn in 2024. Trump and Modi have set a target to more than double this figure to $500bn.

The holiday job market is looking more like a strand of burned-out Christmas tree lights. 
A new Indeed report using data through September showed a disconnect between job seekers and employers. On the job seeker side, there are more searches for holiday work and indications that searches are starting earlier. Meanwhile, employers have posted fewer urgent roles than in the red-hot labor market of 2021. The job-search platform also found that seasonal postings are relatively flat from last year, although down from earlier years.
Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, told Business Insider the holiday job hunt is going to be more competitive than a few years ago.
""Don't wait until we get to mid-November when job postings typically peak because clearly other people are thinking about it now,"" he said.
The report adds to Challenger, Gray & Christmas' findings published in September that there have been ""limited"" US announcements for seasonal work. The outplacement firm expects retail hiring to be weak, potentially hitting its lowest level since 2009. 
""Seasonal employers are facing a confluence of factors this year: tariffs loom, inflationary pressures linger, and many companies continue to rely on automation and permanent staff instead of large waves of seasonal hires,"" Andy Challenger, a senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in the report.
The US job market has been frozen, with millions of unemployed Americans actively seeking work at a time when hiring has cooled. A job during the holiday season could help them earn some income, even if they still want to look for a permanent job.
""As people are unemployed longer, this could be a way for them to say, 'Hey, I just need to get something now. Let's take one of these seasonal jobs, even if it's only temporary,'"" Stahle said.
Some large companies, like Bath & Body Works, have announced seasonal hiring. Gusto, a payroll and benefits platform for small and medium-sized businesses, found based on seasonal hiring in May and June that if trends continue, traditionally in-person gigs that are less affected by tariffs could be bright spots.
""Nontariff-impacted sectors like accommodation and tourism definitely are places where hiring is likely to be up this season compared to last year,"" Andrew Chamberlain, the principal economist at Gusto, said. ""In retail and food service, it looked like all the signs are pointing toward a scale back.""
Chamberlain suggested that job hunters potentially apply to sectors less affected by macroeconomic policy and trade uncertainty.
""American consumers are kind of saying, 'Well, we'll pay for the flight and the hotel, but we're going to skip the souvenir shop,'"" Chamberlain said.
He added: ""If this is any window into what's going to happen this holiday season, that retail story could be a canary in the coal mine, where if those businesses that usually have that big surge in November, December are already pulling back this summer, it tells you they're not exactly expecting a very merry holiday season.""

Trump wanted big tech to leave China. By most appearances, he is getting what he wants.
Microsoft is reportedly the latest company to start decoupling some of its business in China. The big tech giant has asked multiple suppliers to prepare “out of China” production for the company’s Surface laptop computers and data center servers, according to sources briefed on the matter who spoke to Nikkei Asia.
According to the sources, Microsoft wants to manufacture parts and components, and assemble products for new notebook computers and servers outside of China starting as early as 2026. The tech giant has already started shifting a large portion of its server production out of China in 2024, the sources said. Next on the list to be pushed outside of China is reportedly the production of Xbox consoles.
The report also alleges that Amazon Web Services is currently evaluating moving production of its AI data center servers outside of China and reducing sourcing from longtime Chinese suppliers. Meanwhile, other sources told Nikkei that Google is asking suppliers to expand server production capacity in Thailand.
Tech has been the most significant battleground in the tariff war between Washington and Beijing, and American big tech is caught in the crossfire.
Most American big tech companies have supply chains and manufacturing operations in China. All of these operations would be jeopardized if Trump follows through on his threats to impose 100% tariffs on China starting in November, as well as export controls on critical software.
Trump has been adamant about his desire for U.S. companies to decouple from China. He demanded that Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan resign over perceived ties to China, and only backed down on his attack when the company agreed to sell a 10% stake to the U.S. government.
Trump’s attacks are similar in tone to those he wielded in his first presidency. In 2019, Trump “ordered” U.S. companies to leave their China operations.
China, on the other hand, is also using its power over these companies as a battle tactic as the trade war between the two global superpowers escalates.
Just last week, China tightened export controls on some rare earth minerals, which are the lifeline of the tech industry and are especially a key component to the production of computer chips. Beijing is also now requiring companies to obtain licenses from the Chinese government before they can export any product that contains more than 0.1% China-sourced rare earths. China mines 70% of the worldâs rare earth minerals, and refines about 90%.
Beijing has also utilized a slew of antitrust actions against American tech giants. In a high-profile case last month, China’s antitrust regulator concluded a preliminary probe that found Nvidia in violation of Chinese antimonopoly laws. The latest to face China’s legal ire was Qualcomm. China’s top market regulator launched an investigation last week into the American semiconductor company’s acquisition of Israeli startup Autotalks.
China and the U.S. are inextricably linked when it comes to tech. Sources told Nikkei Asia that “removing Chinese suppliers from the supply chain is very difficult in real practice,” at least for AWS. But the tariff escalations are putting compounding pressure on these tech giants, and might be lighting the fuse for a wave of changes.

Beyond Meat went public in 2019 with the promise that plant-based artificial burgers would be the future of meat. Well, we’re in the future, and no one is really buying (or eating) it. With the once-booming meat replacement market hanging on by a thread in the MAHA-led beef tallow and raw milk era, the head of Impossible Foods believes he can heal the meat divide by making a burger for everyone: half meat, half plant.
According to Semafor, Impossible’s CEO Peter McGuinness told audiences at the World Economy Summit that the alt-meat market went wrong when they went all in on positioning themselves as a climate-friendly alternative to Big Beef. He argued the industry was âmismarketed and mislaunchedâ and invited their product, high-end veggie burgers, to get caught up in the culture war. Alternative meats were virtue signaling, basically, and the meat eaters were never going to get on board with it.
So, he’s going back to the drawing board, and he’s sketched out the cure to the sickness at the heart of our culture: the hybrid burger. It’s one of those solutions that is so simple, so obvious that it gives you the impression that you actually didn’t put any thought into it at all, and that if you did think about it for more than a second, you would conclude that it’s probably a terrible idea that serves no one. But McGuinness doesn’t have that second. âIf that got meat eaters to try it and like it, I think itâs a win,â he said.
Getting meat eaters to make the switch was kind of the whole pitch with alternative meats in the first place, because vegans and vegetarians are already not eating meat and don’t need to be tricked with meat-like textures. Why else would you need to make fake burgers bleed? And back in 2019, when these fake meats were all the rage, it was meat eaters who were switching up their diets who made up the majority of the sales, with 90% of the people eating non-meat burgers not identifying as being committed to vegetarian or vegan diets. Nielsen data from that time period found that 98% of alternative meat buyers were also buying meat and just liked the variety.
Novelty is nice for a while, but if the idea was to slowly convert those real meat eaters to alt meats, that never really took. A 2022 study found that people who bought plant-based meat at least once ended up buying slightly more ground meat after their first purchase of a meat alternative. Getting people to convert full-time requires them to make a change in lifestyle, and because plant-based products tend to cost more than real meat options, you kind of have to count on them making that change for reasons that reflect their morals or values, because it’s not going to help their budget. Trying to position alt meats as a health product also didn’t quite work, as more research into the products showed that plant-based patties were often higher in sugar and sodium and lower in important nutrients found in real meat.
There probably is a market for plant-based meat replacements beyond just existing vegans, vegetarians, and recent converts. While McGuinness’s hybrid burger is, frankly, a solution for no one, he is probably right that âPeople donât want to eat tech food or climate food.” But the odds of the current big players in the alt-meat game cracking the code are getting longer. Last year, McGuinness revealed that Impossible still hasn’t turned a profit and could be sold off entirely. Rival fake meat-slinger Beyond Meat just completed a deal to reduce its debt, which drove its stock price under $1âjust a little bit lower than its peak of nearly $250Â per share shortly after its IPO in 2019.

Xiaomi is reportedly pleased with its 17 series performance thus far, and it's making a strong claim about the future of its phones.
The Chinese publication MyDrivers tuned into a livestream by Xiaomi's president, Lu Weibing, where he revealed the early positive performance of the 17 series (via 9to5Google). In a livestream overnight, Lu Weibing revealed that the Xiaomi 17 series ""broke the first-sale record"" for phones in the Chinese market for 2025 (machine-translated). The series was so popular that records were broken merely five minutes after the devices went live for purchase.
The standout here is the 17 Pro Max, which Lu Weibing reportedly said broke ""first-day sales"" records and sales records for ""domestic phones.""
While the 17 series boasts a few improvements over the 15 series, the true showstopper was the ""Dynamic Back Display"" on the 17 Pro and Pro Max. This is a 2.1-inch display on the back of the phone that wraps around its dual camera array, delivering a unique set of interactions that (in some ways) mirror a foldable experience. According to Lu Weibing's statement during the livestream, it's the rear display that's caused such an influx of consumers migrating toward the Xiaomi 17 Pro and Pro Max.
As a result, the publication cites Lu Weibing in saying that Xiaomi will reportedly ""continue to use"" this Dynamic Back Display on future flagship phones. Additionally, the company is already planning to increase its R&D budget to ensure quality for the next wave that utilizes this extra screen.
 



The funny thing is that when confirmation was given that the Xiaomi 17 Pro would use a rear display, it brought us back several years to the Mi 11 Ultra. This device launched in 2021, and it had a rear display alongside its camera housing system. However, the display was vertical and small, only offering a glimpse of the time and date—the necessities, one might say.
It kind of feels like Xiaomi was ahead of its time with that device, as the tech that it has available now wasn't like that back then. Now, with it surging ahead with foldables, it can bring those lessons learned and intelligence to the newer 17 series, a slab phone with a foldable touch.

The Chinese publication mentions that Xiaomi is already preparing even more updates for the Dynamic Back Display, as well.
We'll have to wait for now to see what Xiaomi ends up cooking for next year's launch. In the meantime, what we have are rumors that the company might release a Xiaomi 17 Ultra. Early rumors claim the device could support satellite text and calls, as well as an added 200MP camera with the expected 50MP trio.

 Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock surged by almost 50% between 7/17/2025 and 10/15/2025. The gains come on the back of improving earnings, a recovering CPU market and surging interest in GPUs for artificial intelligence applications. AMD also recently snagged a high profile deal with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, to supply tens of thousands of its GPU chips for 6 gigawatts of computing capacity over the next five years.
From a quantitative perspective, the gains were mainly influenced by a 19.3% shift in the company's Net Income Margin (%). While there is more to this story than just figures, let's first analyze the stock price movement by breaking it down into its contributing factors.
Investing in individual stocks can be daunting, but there is great advantage in adopting a more diversified approach, such as with the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Trefis collaborates with Empirical Asset Management – a Boston-based wealth management firm – whose asset allocation strategies have yielded positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P experienced a loss of over 40%. Empirical has integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio within this asset allocation framework to offer clients superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; it provides a smoother investment experience, as demonstrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
Returning to the “change”: The shifts in fundamental factors such as valuation, revenue, and margins reveal a deeper narrative regarding the business and investor sentiment. Below, we highlight key developments that impacted the price movement of AMD stock. To provide context: AMD offers x86 microprocessors, accelerated processing units, chipsets, discrete and integrated GPUs, data center and professional GPUs, as well as development services across computing, graphics, enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom segments.
Here Is Why Advanced Micro Devices Stock Moved 
Our Current Assessment Of AMD Stock
Opinion: At the moment, we regard AMD stock as relatively pricey. Why is that? For an in-depth analysis, read Buy or Sell AMD Stock to understand the basis of our current view.
Risk: AMD is also vulnerable to significant downturns. It dropped about 83% during the Dot-Com crash and nearly 91% in the Global Financial Crisis. The corrections in 2018 and inflation shock caused losses of 49% and 65%, respectively. Even the Covid sell-off was harsh, erasing over 34%. While solid fundamentals are important, during market downturns, AMD has demonstrated its capacity to incur substantial losses.
Consistently identifying winners is not an easy endeavor, particularly given the volatility associated with individual stocks. Conversely, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a collection of 30 stocks, has a demonstrated history of outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four years. What is the reason for this? On average, HQ Portfolio stocks yielded better returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; resulting in a smoother investment journey, as seen in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

    The new Bolt is cheaper than other ""affordable"" electric cars, all while fixing the weaknesses of its predecessor.
  
This is what the 2027 Chevrolet Bolt would look like in your driveway. It's not a bad-looking car for less than $30,000.
The new Chevrolet Bolt feels like the kind of electric car the EV market has been waiting for -- something genuinely affordable that doesn't make major compromises. Starting at $28,995, it brings electric driving back into reach for regular buyers.
But it's not just about the price: the second-generation Bolt looks to fix the weaknesses of its predecessor while doubling down on practicality and smart technology, aiming to appeal to drivers who want something efficient and approachable without paying top prices. It's worth noting that Tesla's new affordable models start at almost $10,000 more.
The Chevy Bolt also launches at a time when shoppers of electric vehicle will be looking for cheaper options. According to June figures from Kelley Blue Book, the average new vehicle transaction price in the US sits at $48,644. That's 2% lower than the market peak in December 2023 but it's still about 13% more than prices in June 2021.
An up close and personal look at the 2027 Chevrolet Bolt in this striking blue color.
This car is impressive for a sub-$30,000 EV. Its power comes from a 65 kilowatt-hour lithium iron phosphate battery pack, which Chevrolet says is good for 255 miles on a full charge. That's a modest boost over the last Bolt EV and enough for most daily use, especially when paired with charging that's now genuinely fast -- up to 150 kilowatts, with a top-up from 10% to 80% in just 26 minutes.
Chevrolet includes a CCS adapter for older chargers, and there's a native NACS port, meaning Tesla Supercharger access is built in from Day 1. The Bolt's new bidirectional charging setup allows it to output up to 9.6 kilowatts of power, letting owners feed electricity back into their homes during outages or peak hours.
Performance should feel lively, too. The front-wheel-drive setup puts out 210 horsepower, while regenerative braking can be adjusted between low, high or blended modes for a more tailored feel behind the wheel. The Bolt still leans on practicality, offering 16 cubic feet of cargo space with the rear seats up and up to 57 cubic feet when folded. That makes it a good fit for small families or city drivers who occasionally need more room (though an SUV it most certainly is not).
Inside, Chevrolet has modernized the experience with an 11.3-inch touchscreen and an 11-inch digital gauge cluster. The big omission is Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, which GM has decided to drop in favor of a native infotainment system with built-in connectivity. A 2023 McKinsey study revealed that roughly 50% of car buyers in the US would not consider a car without Apple CarPlay -- so this feels like a big miss from General Motors.
Optional Super Cruise hands-free driving brings semi-autonomous highway capability, including lane changes, route following and automatic merging between interchanges. These features were once reserved for much more expensive EVs, but are now appearing in more affordable vehicles -- a win for car shoppers.
Chevrolet is offering the car in three trims: The base LT at $28,995, an LT Comfort at $29,990 and the sportier RS trim for about $32,000. Deliveries will begin in the US in early 2026, with all models built at GM's Fairfax, Kansas, plant. At a time when many electric cars still cost well north of $40,000, this one might just prove that the affordable EV isn't dead after all.

The markets may be fretting about an AI bubble, but Goldman Sachs says the boom is still in its opening act.
That's because the scale of current investment remains small compared with the potential economic payoff, analysts at the Wall Street giant argue.
""The enormous economic value promised by generative AI justifies the current investment in AI infrastructure and overall levels of AI investment appear sustainable as long as companies expect that investment today will generate outsized returns over the long run,"" wrote analysts at Goldman Sachs in a Wednesday note.
The bank's analysts pointed to two main reasons for their call: AI applications are already delivering productivity gains where they're deployed, and unlocking those gains requires massive computing power.
Goldman estimates that the long-term value created by AI productivity far exceeds its upfront costs. The firm projects that widespread AI adoption could add $20 trillion to the US economy, with about $8 trillion of that flowing to companies as capital income.
""Generative AI still appears set to deliver a rapid acceleration in task automation that will drive labor cost savings and boost productivity, with our baseline estimates suggesting a 15% gross uplift to economy-wide US labor productivity following full adoption, which we expect will realize over a 10-year period,"" the analysts wrote.
Despite record-breaking spending on chips, servers, and data centers, Goldman says AI investment is modest by the standards of past technology revolutions.
The firm estimates that AI-related investment in the US is under 1% of GDP, compared with the 2% to 5% of GDP reached during earlier technology booms, including the railroad expansion, the electrification wave of the 1920s, and the dot-com era of the late 1990s.
Goldman's analysts said they still see the macroeconomic justification for AI investment as compelling and are ""less concerned about the dollar amount of AI capex."" They noted that roughly $300 billion is being spent annually in 2025 — a scale they view as appropriate given the technology's long-term potential returns.
Still, Goldman acknowledges ""valid concerns"" about whether the companies pouring the most money into AI will ultimately reap the rewards, especially given hardware's rapid depreciation.
The analysts argue that timing matters less if investors can capture an outsize share of AI's long-term economic value. But history suggests that being first doesn't always mean finishing best.
""First movers"" could fare poorly in infrastructure buildouts, they wrote, citing railroads and telecommunications as examples. In many cases, later entrants captured better returns by acquiring assets cheaply after an early overbuild.
That dynamic could repeat in the AI era.
""The current AI market structure provides little clarity into whether today's AI leaders will be long-run AI winners,"" they wrote.
""First-mover advantages are stronger when complementary assets (e.g., semiconductors) are scarce and production is vertically integrated—suggesting that today's leaders may outperform—but weaker in periods of rapid technological change like today,"" they added.
Early adopters are also hedging their bets by using multiple AI models instead of sticking to one ecosystem, which could weaken incumbents' advantages, the analysts said.
They added that it's difficult to pinpoint when the motivation to keep pouring money into AI will fade, since early productivity gains and steady improvements in model performance are still encouraging investment.
""So while investment should eventually moderate as the AI investment cycle moves beyond the build phase and declining hardware costs dominate, the technological backdrop still looks supportive for continued AI investment,"" the analysts wrote.
Goldman's assessment lands amid an intense debate about whether AI has inflated another tech bubble.
Last week, strategists at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs argued that AI stock valuations aren't as stretched as critics claim when factoring earnings growth, cash flow, and profit margins.

14,2025-10-16,"While we have unsurprisingly yet to see any straight discounts on the just-announced M5 MacBook Pro, Best Buy is seeking to entice upgraders with some trade-in offers toward the new models.
Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Best Buy. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.
Best Buy is currently offering up to $800 in trade-in value for a base M4 MacBook Pro, with higher-spec machines qualifying for even more. Base M3 MacBook Pro models qualify for up to $600 in trade-in credit, while base M2 models qualify for up to $490 and base M1 models qualify for up to $300. My Best Buy Plus and My Best Buy Total members are also eligible for an extra 10% on their trade-in value.


TRADE-INS
M5 MacBook at Best Buy

The new M5 MacBook Pro starts at $1,599, with higher-spec stock configurations available at $1,799 and $1,999 price points. Pre-orders are available now ahead of a launch next Wednesday, October 22.
Apple also offers its own trade-in program for Macs and other devices, so it's worth comparing trade-in values to determine what the best option is for you. Private sales can also frequently yield higher values for a given model, though that can come with more hassle and less security than a retail trade-in partner like Best Buy or Apple, so you need to weigh priorities when deciding how to upgrade.

15,2025-10-16,"Your truly is not keen about having to think as much about stock market price levels as seems warranted of late. It’s pretty obvious AI plays are in a monster bubble, but that does not mean they won’t go even higher before reality drags them back to earth. As we’ve said, historically a stock market rout, unless fueled by lots of debt as in the Great Crash, does not generate a crisis but does damage the economy though investors pulling way back on spending and capital expenditures. That loss of demand is recessionary and can produce deflation and zombification. So the hangover can still do a lot of harm. 
Some market-watching sites, including Wolf Richter’s, have been sounding alarms about US margin debt hitting an all-time high. Here’s Wolf’s chart and a snippet from his commentary:
Leverage in the stock market has been spiking since April. In September, margin debt – the amount investors borrowed from their brokers – spiked by another 6.3%, or by $67 billion, from August to a record $1.13 trillion…
The additional leverage – borrowed money flowing into the stock market – creates buying pressure and drives stock prices higher. Leverage is the great accelerator on the way up, but it’s also the great accelerator on the way down. Multi-month surges in margin debt, jumping from new high to new high, indicate excessive speculation and risk-taking and have invariably led to sharp selloffs:

The wee problem is that while the picture above is accurate, it doesn’t add as much to what we know about stock market frothiness as one might think. Borrowing against stocks is strictly regulated. So when market prices go up a lot, so to does margin borrowing. The chart above does give another demonstration of how sharply stock prices have risen and that when those spells of wild enthusiasm wear off, the forced deleveraging accelerates the plunge.
A rejoinder from the admittedly mainstream Morningstar in August:
Margin debt isn’t a red flag for one investor.
One of the explanations put forward recently for the record-breaking rally in the U.S. stock market was the equally record-breaking amount of margin debt that had been incurred in the process. Money borrowed to invest in shares topped $1 trillion in August.
For Brian Jacobs of Aptus Capital, however, this is not the five-alarm fire it sounds and is less ominous than investors might suspect. Economist David Rosenberg posted on X a few weeks back that the number was “pretty scary” but Jacobs contends it’s merely a coincident indicator, a symptom of the market’s meteoric rise, rather than a signal of its imminent demise.
Jacobs writes in a recent investment blog: “It (margin debt) moves with the market. When equities rise, account values increase, and investors naturally take on more leverage. Margin debt rising 25% over the last year? The S&P 500 SPX is up about the same. Margin debt has almost doubled over the last five years? The S&P 500 is up about the same.” 
But having said that, while a crude look at margin debt levels may not do more than demonstrate that stocks have gone up a lot, and quickly of late, other ways of parsing margin borrowing do paint a worrisome picture. At the end of September, Cory McPherson at Pro-Active Capital published Margin Debt Showing Investors Going All In. Key sections:
From the August [2025] numbers, margin debt relative to nominal GDP sits at 3.48%. The record high reading was 3.97% in October 2021. For historical context though, the peak in that ratio was 2.6% in the dot-com bubble days in 2000, and 2.5% in 2007 before the great recession.
Another way to look at is Margin Debt Carry Load. This factors in the interest being paid on the margin debt. The chart below shows the dollar amount of margin debt multiplied by the estimated margin rate, which is calculated as the major bank prime rate plus 2%. This is then put in % of nominal GDP. You can see we have now reached levels seen during the last stages of the dot-com bubble days in 2000. Margin debt, though, is definitely not a timing indicator. This can continue to get higher and higher, just as the stock market can. What it can do, though, is create violent downturns in the market. When an investor owns stock on margin and that stock goes down a certain amount, the brokerage forces the investor to sell, which can create an elevator down affect, similar to what we saw in April of this year.

A fundamental metric on the stock market has also reached extreme heights recently. The price to sales ratio is a valuation metric that compares a company’s stock price to its revenue. Basically, a measure of what investors are willing to pay for each dollar of sales from a company. In looking at the price to sales ratio of the S&P 500 (taking the market cap of the S&P 500 and dividing by the total sales of all companies in the S&P 500 over the past 12 months), you can see we’ve surpassed last year’s and 2021’s peak in the ratio. It is also way past the peak that was seen in the dot-com bubble days, which is thought to be one of if not the biggest stock market bubbles in history. Much of this is being driven of course by technology stocks and the AI boom we’ve seen over the last few years. Stock prices have got way ahead of actual sales. While overvaluation doesn’t cause market drops or bear markets, they do often precede them.

McPherson then considers some real economy data anomalies, that the big downward jobs revision happened without a recession, and that the Conference Boards leading indicators have been falling for three years while its coincident indicator continues to rise. It seems that running very large fiscal deficits for a while can produce confusing results.
The reason for concern about stock market froth is rather a lot is riding on it. We pointed out that US households’ stock holding relative to other financial assets was at an all time high:
⚠️This is truly INSANE:
US households now own a RECORD 52% of their financial assets in equities.
This share has more than DOUBLED since the Great Financial Crisis and surpassed the 2000 Dot-Com Bubble by ~5 points.
The hold just 15% in cash and 14% in debt assets. pic.twitter.com/6DRmtxYSze

Foreign investors have also wagered a lot in the US casino. The Economist has just posted, Gita Gopinath on the crash that could torch $35trn of wealth. From Gopinath, the former chief economist of the IMF:
Over the past decade and a half, American households have significantly increased their holdings in the stockmarket, encouraged by strong returns and the dominance of American tech firms. Foreign investors, particularly from Europe, have for the same reasons poured capital into American stocks, while simultaneously benefiting from the dollar’s strength. This growing interconnectedness means that any sharp downturn in American markets will reverberate around the world.
To put the potential impact in perspective, I calculate that a market correction of the same magnitude as the dotcom crash could wipe out over $20trn in wealth for American households, equivalent to roughly 70% of American GDP in 2024. This is several times larger than the losses incurred during the crash of the early 2000s. The implications for consumption would be grave. Consumption growth is already weaker than it was preceding the dotcom crash. A shock of this magnitude could cut it by 3.5 percentage points, translating into a two-percentage-point hit to overall GDP growth, even before accounting for declines in investment.
The global fallout would be similarly severe. Foreign investors could face wealth losses exceeding $15trn, or about 20% of the rest of the world’s GDP. For comparison, the dotcom crash resulted in foreign losses of around $2trn, roughly $4trn in today’s money and less than 10% of rest-of-world GDP at the time. This stark increase in spillovers underscores how vulnerable global demand is to shocks originating in America.
Historically, the rest of the world has found some cushion in the dollar’s tendency to rise during crises. This “flight to safety” has helped mitigate the impact of lost dollar-denominated wealth on foreign consumption. The greenback’s strength has long provided global insurance, often appreciating even when the crisis originates in America, as investors seek refuge in dollar assets.
There are, though, reasons to believe that this dynamic may not hold in the next crisis. Despite well-founded expectations that American tariffs and expansionary fiscal policy would bolster the dollar, it has instead fallen against most major currencies…
Compounding the situation, and adding to the overall risk, is the escalation of the tariff wars. Further tit-for-tat tariffs between America and China would damage not just their bilateral trade but global trade too, as almost all countries are exposed to the world’s two largest economies via complex supply chains. More generally, avoiding chaotic or unpredictable policy decisions, including those that threaten central-bank independence, is critical to prevent a market collapse…
In sum, a market crash today is unlikely to result in the brief and relatively benign economic downturn that followed the dotcom bust. There is a lot more wealth on the line now—and much less policy space to soften the blow of a correction. The structural vulnerabilities and macroeconomic cont
Ouch. But you can see why we are watching with bated breath.

My neighbours sold their house in San Jose to a couple, one of whom works for Nvidia. I’m under contract selling my house to a couple, one of whom works for Nvidia. Good for them, I suppose, moving stock option money into RE, but when that narrow population of wealthy techies has bought somewhere, who else will buy SFHs? Townhome/condo inventory is rising in the Bay Area, not helped by the egregious (I love the flow of that word) HOA fees here.
“Your truly is not keen about having to think as much about stock market price levels as seems warranted of late. ”
It’s situational awareness. How can it not be noticed that, just about all over the world, the stock markets behave like geopolitical threats are bullish?
It has been just about a long enough time since the big financial crash of 1929 for the lessons learned then to have been forgotten. The more recent “crashes” happened under at least a modicum of the Post 1929 regulatory paradigm to have softened those blows to the economy. Today, thanks to the Bull Market in the China Shop gutting of most post 1929 Crash regulations, the American economy is almost as vulnerable to “excess exuberance” and its attendant profligacies as it was back then. And yet, our present day Neo-liberal Masters of the Multiverse expect the outcomes to be different this time.
A rising tide may float all boats, but it also drowns those without boats. Anecdotally, many a lifeboat has been swamped and overturned by frantic crowds of sinking people grabbing to the gunwales, trying to get aboard. Elon had better get his Mars Project up and running fast before the window of opportunity slams shut for a generation.
Stay safe.
I am sure Minsky would say that it’s been long enough since 2008 for that experience to be forgotten. 
But the system seems to insulate against lessons being learned anyway.
One other scary metric is $7 trillion in cash, money market funds and other short term instruments. That potential avalanche into markets would seem to restrict Fed options as they meet periodically to thread needles.
the even bigger story same-day index and stock options—which makes sense given (by recent standards) sky-high margin rates, if you want leverage, options  make sense.

Retail Traders Drive Record Options Volume Amid Market Turmoil: A New Era of Influence
The financial markets witnessed an extraordinary event just last week, on Friday, October 10, 2025, as options trading volume surged to an unprecedented high, clearing over 110 million contracts. This historic milestone, which shattered previous records, was overwhelmingly driven by the robust activity of retail traders, who aggressively “bought the dip” in a volatile market. The record-breaking day highlights the growing and undeniable influence of individual investors, signaling a significant shift in market dynamics and raising questions about future stability and price formation.
This surge in retail-driven options trading occurred concurrently with a sharp downturn in the broader stock market, marking its worst performance since April. Despite the widespread sell-off, sparked by geopolitical concerns, retail investors demonstrated a remarkable resilience and an increased appetite for risk, utilizing highly leveraged options contracts to position themselves for a rebound. This behavior underscores a new paradigm where individual investors are not merely passive participants but active shapers of market sentiment and momentum.
As I said in a comment on a another blog entry, let’s remember that the US is currently running a 6% budget deficit if not higher…during the Dot Bomb we were technically in a surplus….In my opinion, this thing can still go on for a while, it’s like having an hydrant wide open on one side of the tub, $1T of additional “debt” every 100 days or so.
Funding strains starting to show up in SOFR markets, Fed’s standing repo facility starting to get some use, perhaps from the regional banks finding more cockroaches. Everyone has been speculating because the returns were too good to ignore. Very few have the patience and experience of Mr Buffet who knows from times past that the only good move is to stay out. Will be fascinating to find out if he has gone from T bills to gold in size.

Inside of China's borders? Good luck!
I mean ""good luck"" to any of us still breathing after after WW3.
About the Monroe Doctrine, we're all familiar with the Teddy Roosevelt part about policing the entire Western Hemisphere, but the original doctrine was that the Europeans should stay out of the Western Hemisphere (especially after the independence of Mexico and Brazil) and that in return the US would stay out of the rest of the world.  Of course, that last part isn't remembered as much.  US influence around the world today would be a violation of the Monroe Doctrine.
Problem is, then he'd have to take out pretty much all of Congress!

In Australia this is a mostly solved problem.Our phone companies track spammers and our phones say, spam caller.I also get this with AT&T.I wonder why the phone and messaging companies aren't more active in tagging and blocking spam calls and messages.

In Australia this is a mostly solved problem.Our phone companies track spammers and our phones say, spam caller.
I also get this with AT&T.

I don't really think you can trust everything they say to be a lie.

In the cases where some organization _demands_ a phone number, they get my landline. Which is for outgoing calls only. The phone doesn't even have a ringer.

Zero. Providers are required to block them here. And they do.
That sounds nice, but here in America we put our businesses first, second and third before we remotely care about the consumer. As such, I don't even answer my phone anymore unless the caller ID shows a real business. Sometimes it does and I'll answer. Vastly majority of incoming calls are just a number and I won't answer.
Yep. My condolences. Unfettered capitalism turns everything to crap.
P.S. We're not even people here. We're consumers. Sigh.

Scott Stevens' phone is ringing off the hook.
Stevens, the founder of private credit firm Grays Peak Capital, provides bridge financing to companies that get government contracts, mostly in the defense sector. His firm is raising its second fund, which will have at least $500 million to put to work but could swell to $1 billion if he finds the right opportunities to entice his backers to contribute more.
And with the government shutdown, there have been a lot of opportunities.
""I have never had so many people wanting to meet with me,"" he told Business Insider in an interview, about borrowers reaching out to him.
Stevens, a former investor for Steve Cohen's SAC Capital and Philippe Laffont's Coatue, has carved out a niche in the fast-growing private credit space, stepping in when banks or traditional lenders can't. He said it's generally a safe bet to loan to companies awaiting government contracts. Government infrastructure projects, like maritime ports and rural broadband, contract out to private companies to do the work, but ""the government is not designed to move quickly"" and get them startup capital to begin a project.
Stevens left SAC in 2014 and set up Grays Peak, which also invests in private equity, venture capital, and real estate. His private equity sleeve purchased a few companies that had government contracts, which led him to this field, he said.
Stevens' first private credit fund annualized 16% over 2023 and 2024, investing $300 million during that time. The government shutdown should only help his bottom line.
""I have more pricing power than I did a year ago,"" he said. Private credit lenders structure deals with more flexible, customized terms and charge higher rates to offset that added risk.
He targets mostly short-term loans — between half a year and 18 months — and avoids projects that are more tied to an administration's preferences. Renewable energy projects, for example, have fallen by the wayside under President Donald Trump's administration after receiving a big boost during former President Joe Biden's time in office.
""We're never funding something that's at the risk of being cut,"" he said.
Stevens is still somewhat new to the space and said he's surprised at how big the market is. Smaller regional banks, he said, used to do more of this type of lending but have backed away from the space.
This area of lending can be challenging to break into because many defense-adjacent companies handle classified information and can't disclose their work with outside partners unless they also hold security clearances.
Stevens said that most of his team consists of former government workers or military veterans who already have some form of clearance or are familiar with the process. The deals he is focused on are smaller than what the largest private lenders in the industry typically target, so there's less competition for deals.
He's also looking abroad as Europe is set to increase its spending on defense. American contractors, he said, are looking to sell to European countries, but will need financing to set up operations abroad.
""That's a market we didn't have before, for sure,"" he said.

For years, Amazon Web Services was among the first, and often the largest, line item on a startup's budget. The AI boom is upending that spending pattern.
Internal documents obtained by Business Insider reveal that AWS has flagged a ""fundamental"" shift in how startups are allocating their cloud budgets. Increasingly, they're delaying AWS cloud adoption and diverting spending toward AI models, inference, and AI developer tools.
Instead of pouring money into traditional cloud services like compute and storage, these companies are spreading costs across newer AI technologies that are easier to switch between, according to the documents.
""Founders tell us they seek to adopt AWS at a later stage,"" one of the documents warned.
This suggests a seismic shift is happening in the cloud industry. AWS's dominance was built on startups that embraced its affordable, scalable computing services as an alternative to running their own data centers. But the generative AI boom has ushered in a new era, a ""Cloud 2.0"" stack of specialized hardware, software, and tools. As startups use these new AI offerings first, and wait longer to spend on AWS, the cloud giant's once-firm grip on this lucrative ecosystem could begin to loosen.
To be sure, startups are not abandoning AWS entirely, as they still need its cloud services at later stages. However, their behavior highlights how emerging AI technologies are capturing early IT budgets in new ways and potentially locking in customers before AWS's traditional offerings come into play.
The internal documents cited in this story, marked ""Amazon Confidential,"" are from March and July. They were written by employees on AWS' startup business team, including a person who works closely with Y Combinator startups. The documents were also reviewed by AWS executives who manage startup and venture capital relationships. BI verified the identities of these people. Jon Jones, former VP of global startups and venture capital at AWS, is also listed on the March document as one of the business owners responsible for this part of Amazon's cloud operations.
In addition, at least three current and former employees familiar with AWS's startup business told Business Insider that the concerns expressed in these internal documents were still valid as of September. These people asked not to be identified as they're not authorized to talk to the press.
Before publication, an AWS spokesperson said this story was using ""old data to reach outdated conclusions."" Startups continue to build on AWS, including leading AI startups such as Perplexity and Luma AI, which ""recently chose"" AWS, the spokesperson added.
""AWS remains the top choice for startups to build because we offer the best core services as well as the most innovative and powerful generative AI offerings,"" the spokesperson wrote in an emailed statement. ""Early stage startups experiment with many services and technologies, but when it comes time to choose the provider they trust with the future of their organizations, they overwhelmingly choose AWS.""
""In fact, we're seeing growth in adoption of AWS as startups are looking to our depth and breadth of services,"" the spokesperson added.
Many AI startups now make their first technology purchases from AI model providers such as OpenAI and Anthropic, followed by newer developer platforms such as Vercel, according to one of the AWS documents. That means founders are putting off decisions to buy AWS services until later, often when they require advanced capabilities such as compliance and security, the document explained.
Among Y Combinator's 2024 cohort, 59% reported using more than three AWS services, down by more than four percentage points from 2022, according to the document from March. Meanwhile, 88% of these startups were using OpenAI's models and 72% were using Anthropic's. Only 4.3% said they were using AWS's Bedrock developer tool, which gives access to various AI models.
The AWS spokesperson said this metric is ""at least a year old, and it's not indicative of usage or adoption of AWS.""
Earlier this year, AWS compiled a list of the top 1,000 AI startups for Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, along with an assessment of whether they were building primarily on the tech giant's cloud platform, according to the July document. The goal: What does it mean to be ""all in"" on AWS in the AI era?
With cloud spending rapidly growing beyond ""traditional compute,"" storage, databases, and analytics, ""this question is getting much harder to answer,"" AWS employees wrote in the July document.
New AI categories of spending ""can represent the majority of a startup's cloud consumption and are much less sticky than traditional services, allowing rapid shifts across an expanding list of providers,"" they warned in the document.
The AWS employees cited three newer AI cloud services that were grabbing early spending from these startups: GPU training and fine tuning, GPU inference, and AI-as-a-service, according to the document.
GPUs are special chips that power generative AI. That's a contrast to traditional cloud services, which run on CPUs. Training and fine tuning are ways to build and improve AI models, while inference is how models are run. AI-as-a-service provides access to models and other AI tools, usually via application programming interfaces (APIs) and subscriptions.
The AWS employees cited AI coding startup Cursor as an example of these issues, according to the July document. Cursor's spending on ""traditional infrastructure"" was less than 10% of what it spends on newer AI categories, even though the startup is considered ""all in"" on the AWS platform.
The ""majority"" of Cursor's spending goes toward API calls to external AI models and ""neocloud"" providers that primarily sell access to GPU servers, the document noted. It didn't mention specific neoclouds, but some of these newer AI cloud vendors include CoreWeave, Crusoe, Lambda Labs, and Nebius.
The AWS spokesperson told Business Insider that the concerns around ""all-in"" customers were ""false,"" without providing further details. Business Insider followed up on Thursday to ask for more specifics, but didn't get a response. A Cursor representative didn't respond to a request for comment.
To be sure, these documents are from March and July, and AWS may have turned things around with AI startups in recent months. However, revenue growth from this key part of Amazon has lagged behind some other cloud providers lately, on a percentage basis.
In the second quarter, Google Cloud and Microsoft's Azure each grew more than 30%, year-over-year, while AWS grew 18%. Neocloud revenue has soared by more than 200% in the past year, albeit from a much lower base, according to Synergy Research Group.
""With Azure and Google Cloud Platform growing faster than AWS, the once-strong incumbent's market position may lead to three equal players,"" Theory Ventures' Tomasz Tunguz wrote in a recent blog post.
Still, it's early in the AI cloud battle, and Amazon has prodigious resources and advantages. The company maintains a close and promising partnership with Anthropic, having invested billions of dollars in the leading AI lab. In July, Morgan Stanley estimated that Amazon could generate $5.6 billion in revenue by 2027 from Anthropic's use of AWS cloud services. In September, Wells Fargo upgraded Amazon to ""buy"" based on its belief that Anthropic will enable AWS growth to accelerate in 2026.
Investors also say that AI isn't necessarily cannibalizing AWS's cloud revenue. Some of the money startups are channeling into new AI services likely flows back to major cloud providers that supply GPUs and other AI cloud infrastructure. Still, AWS risks losing ground if it can't capture those early customers as spending shifts, they said.
""AWS is still a step behind Microsoft and Google in driving GPU demand and the ability to sell add-ons to these customers,"" Gil Luria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, told Business Insider.
CB Insights data shows AWS losing some ground among the 1,100 leading AI startups. Between January 2024 and September 2025, AWS captured 30% of that market, trailing Google Cloud's 38%, but outpacing Microsoft Azure's 7%. That marks a decline from the prior two-year period (2022 to 2024), when AWS claimed 33%, Google Cloud 34%, and Microsoft 9%. Roughly 25% of the startups said they used more than two cloud providers.
AWS' AI pricing strategy isn't helping it win startup customers either.
Earlier this year, AWS found that 90% of early-stage startups in Radical Ventures' portfolio were building primarily on rival clouds, citing AWS's higher GPU costs compared with competitors, according to one of the documents from March.
Following that discovery, Jassy and AWS CEO Matt Garman met with Radical Ventures' leadership to craft a new strategy aimed at better targeting the firm's startup investments and offering a more complete suite of AWS services, according to this document. A representative from Radical Ventures declined to comment.
The AWS spokesperson said Cohere, Datology, and Twelve Labs are AWS customers and are part of the Radical Ventures portfolio.
Neocloud providers, such as CoreWeave, which specialize in GPU-based computing, may be starting to emerge as serious competitors for AWS. One of the documents noted growing demand among customers for access to ""small increments of GPU capacity"" with pay-as-you-go flexibility, an area where AWS is at a ""disadvantage"" compared with neoclouds.
Frustration with AWS's pricing has also surfaced publicly. Gavin Baker of Atreides Management recently wrote on X that AWS had raised prices for Nvidia's Blackwell chips. In response, Chamath Palihapitiya of Social Capital wrote that Amazon had become ""too expensive,"" adding that his portfolio company, 8090, had switched to using chips from Groq, another one of his investments.
The AWS spokesperson told Business Insider that the company is ""always working to optimize products and services for our customers,"" adding that it recently cut the price of EC2 Nvidia GPU-accelerated instances by 45%.
AWS also acknowledged in one of the documents that there's a notable shift toward ""industry-specific AI adoption,"" exemplified by the growth of startups such as Harvey in legal tech and Lila Sciences in biotech. AWS expected this trend to accelerate as AI moves deeper into specialized applications and intelligent agents, the document noted.
The AWS spokesperson said the company is seeing growth across ""all AI startups,"" from foundational models to vertical and horizontal solutions leveraging AI.
Another challenge for AWS is its lagging reputation in AI, which is making it increasingly difficult to secure speaking slots for executives at venture-capital events and other industry conferences, according to one of the documents. The issue is particularly pronounced in the Bay Area, where many of those opportunities are concentrated, it stated.
""2.5 years post the launch of ChatGPT, AWS is still viewed as playing catch up in AI by many public/private investors, founders, and industry influencers,"" the document warned.
The AWS spokesperson told Business Insider this is ""false,"" without providing further details.
This skepticism isn't limited to private investors. During Amazon's July earnings call, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak questioned Jassy about perceptions that AWS is falling behind in AI and losing market share to competitors. Jassy's answer did little to reassure investors, and Amazon's stock slipped further during the call.
AWS is also struggling to identify and engage early-stage startups that later evolve into major cloud customers. One of the internal documents noted that AWS's VC-driven discovery model isn't well-suited to the rise of ""AI-native solopreneurs and bootstrapped teams."" To address this, the company plans to develop a data-driven prediction model to better surface promising startups early on.
""This blind spot poses increasing risk to cloud market share,"" it stated.
The AWS spokesperson said the company continues to engage founders as early as possible, in collaboration with VCs through programs such as AWS GenAI Accelerator and AWS Activate.
Several Amazon employees told Business Insider that AWS's startup leadership team lacks deep experience in the venture ecosystem, which may be compounding the problem. The challenge was underscored by the abrupt departure of Jon Jones, AWS's vice president of startups and venture capital, who resigned last month after a year in the role.
Here's the full statement from the AWS spokesperson:

There isn't much to love about colder weather, at least in my humble opinion. But one thing I can always get behind is the full embrace of comfort food.
And what's more comforting than pasta or soup? Well, what about pasta and soup?
After seeing lasagna soup all over my TikTok and Instagram feeds, I decided it was finally time to try the dish. And who better to lead the way than Ree Drummond, also known as the Pioneer Woman?
To make 8-10 servings of Drummond's lasagna soup, you'll need:
For the ricotta dumplings, you'll need:
Compared to some soups I've made, such as Ina Garten's chicken chili, there's very little prep for Drummond's recipe.
All I had to do was slice the onions, chop some parsley, and mince my garlic, thyme, and oregano.
I cooked the veggies and herbs over medium heat for about two minutes, stirring occasionally, until they started to soften.
I increased the heat to medium-high before adding the ground beef and sausage, which I seasoned with one teaspoon of salt and half a teaspoon of black pepper.
I broke up the beef and sausage with a meat masher, which made this step super quick; however, you can also use a wooden spoon.
Drummond recommends draining off ""at least half of the grease"" once your meat is ready.
I stirred everything in the pot and let the tomato paste cook for one minute.
I stirred everything together again, allowing the wine to deglaze the bottom of the pot.
Drummond's recipe calls for a 14.5-ounce can, but I could only find 28-ounce cans at the store. I decided to use the entire can so my soup would have even more broth.
I crushed the whole tomatoes with a wooden spoon as I stirred everything together.
Now my pot was starting to look like a soup!
Once my soup was boiling, I reduced the heat so it could simmer.
Drummond recommends simmering your soup for 20 minutes. I had some extra time and wanted the flavors to develop a little longer, so I opted for 40 minutes instead.
Drummond's recipe calls for 12 lasagna noodles, but I used the entire box. I have a strict No Noodle Left Behind policy.
I filled a pot with salted water and brought it to a boil, breaking the noodles into smaller pieces as I added them.
Drummond says you should let the noodles cook for about a minute less than the package instructions, until they're almost tender, so I cooked my pasta for nine minutes total.
After draining the noodles, I drizzled some olive oil on top to prevent them from sticking together. I had a feeling my broth would need far more liquid once I added the noodles, so I also saved the pasta water.
All I needed to do was mince some more parsley and basil.
My soup was almost ready!
I let the soup simmer for five minutes after adding the noodles and pasta water.
I added the ricotta and Parmesan cheeses to a bowl, along with the chopped parsley and basil.
I seasoned the mixture with salt and pepper and stirred everything together, molding it into one big ball I could scoop my little dumplings out of.
This is such an impressive-looking soup.
I loved how the white ricotta dumplings popped against the deep-red broth of the soup, and the sprinkle of basil on top was a nice touch. The curves of the lasagna noodles peeking through the surface made my bowl look especially inviting.
I opted for small dumplings because I liked their presentation, but you could also use big dollops if you prefer.
Drummond's lasagna soup is deliciously hearty, and that first spoonful of meat, pasta, and cheese instantly warmed my soul.
The broth needs more salt to taste, but it goes so well with the creamy ricotta dumplings. I recommend really mixing them into the broth to give your soup even more of a flavor punch, and make sure to break the noodles into smaller pieces so they're easier to pick up with each spoonful.
I made this for my fiancé, Peter, and our friends Kayla and Oliver. They decreed this another win in my ongoing mission to find the best soup recipes.
""It's quite literally lasagna but in a comforting soup format,"" Peter said. ""The best of both worlds.""
Oliver also had the idea to make the soup with ravioli or tortellini instead, which I think is a fabulous recommendation.
Whether you're looking to destress or just want a cozy night in, Drummond's lasagna soup is the comfort dinner of dreams.

Earnings season has kicked off, and investors are parsing results to see if their favorite trade can keep going strong into year-end. 
Luckily, Wall Street got a firm signal that the AI trade is still alive and well on Thursday, with one of the biggest names in semiconductors reporting stellar results for the third quarter. Stocks jumped in morning trading, with chip stocks broadly in focus for investors. 
Here's where major indexes stood shortly after the 9:30 a.m. ET opening bell on Thursday:
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company raised its full-year guidance and revealed a bullish outlook for AI spending as it reported $33.10 billion in Q3 revenue, a 40.8% year-over-year increase and a 10% jump from the previous quarter. Compared to Q2, Q3 results showed a 6.0% revenue bump and a 13.6% increase in net income.
Executives at the company weren't shy about where they see the latest strength coming from, pointing specifically to massive demand from AI. CEO C.C. Wei said on the earnings call that the company is convinced that ""the AI megatrend is strengthening.""  
Other chip stocks jumped on the news of the strong results, with Nvidia and Broadcom both up 1%. 
TSMC's results also importantly helped investors shrug off their other big fear this week, which is that the trade war will once again become an overhang for the market.
This week saw a new flare-up of tariff worries as the White House insisted it would take a tough stance on China in light of its latest moves to restrict flows of rare earth materials. 
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Wednesday that investors should not count on the administration to change its position on trade to boost a flailing stock market. The so-called TACO trade was already on display this week after Donald Trump calmed nerves with a post on Sunday, after last Friday's tough talk on China tariffs sent stocks plummeting. 
Meanwhile, TSMC wasn't the only tech update that boosted investors' spirits.
Foxconn, known for producing key components for Apple, recently revealed that its chairman met with representatives from OpenAI and has plans to meet with Nvidia in the near future.
The ChatGPT maker has been on a deal-making spree lately, inking contracts with companies such as Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices and Oracle. 
With one top AI supplier raising guidance and another exploring a deal with OpenAI, investors are rekindling bets that the AI craze will keep pushing the market higher. 
Despite the volatility stemming from trade war jitters, stocks are on track for a solid week of gains, with the S&P 500 up nearly 1% since last Friday's close.

Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) is scheduled to announce its earnings on Tuesday, October 21, 2025. We anticipate that the company will report quarterly revenues of approximately $2.5 billion, supported by ongoing growth in procedure volumes and robust demand for its da Vinci surgical systems. Nevertheless, we expect margins to experience slight pressure due to rising component costs and increased R&D expenditures. While recurring instrument and service revenue remains a significant profit contributor, the mix of hardware sales and pricing dynamics may dampen immediate profitability. The growing implementation in general surgery and international markets continues to bolster growth, but sustained margin enhancement will rely on cost leverage and product innovation over the upcoming quarters.
The company currently has a market capitalization of $156 billion. Revenue over the past twelve months was $9.1 billion, and it was operationally profitable with $2.6 billion in operating profits and net income of $2.6 billion. Although much will depend on how the results compare against consensus and expectations, comprehending historical patterns could potentially tilt the odds in your favor if you are an event-driven trader.
There are two approaches to achieving this: either grasp the historical probabilities and position yourself before the earnings announcement, or evaluate the relationship between immediate and medium-term returns following the earnings release and adjust your position accordingly once the results are out. That being said, if you desire upside potential with less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an attractive alternative – having outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception.

Here are some insights on one-day (1D) post-earnings returns:
Additional information regarding observed 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns following earnings is encapsulated along with the statistics in the table belo
A relatively less hazardous strategy (though not advantageous if the correlation is minimal) is to understand the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns following earnings, identify a pair that exhibits the highest correlation, and execute the corresponding trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D demonstrate the highest correlation, a trader may position themselves ""long"" for the next 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Below is some correlation data based on a 5-year and a 3-year (more recent) history. Please note that the correlation 1D_5D refers to the relationship between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns.

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is anticipated to announce its earnings on Thursday, October 23, 2025. Expected earnings are projected to be around break-even at $0.01 per share, according to consensus estimates, while revenues are predicted to decrease by 1.5% to $13.1 billion. Intel has been facing significant challenges in its CPU segment due to ongoing market share losses to competitor AMD in both the server and client computing arenas. The broader shift in the market from CPUs to GPUs in the era of generative artificial intelligence has also affected the company’s performance. Nevertheless, we will be keenly awaiting updates regarding the foundry business, which has been increasing production of its latest 18A process technology. Intel recently revealed important details about its upcoming Panther Lake laptop chip, the first chip to be manufactured employing the new production process, aimed at high-end AI-enabled laptops.
Intel stock has surged by an impressive 80% year-to-date, largely propelled by substantial investment commitments from the U.S. government and GPU giant Nvidia. However, the stock typically performs poorly after its earnings announcements. Analyzing data from the past 5 years, the stock has registered positive returns in only 25% of instances one day following earnings.
The company currently holds a market capitalization of $165 billion. Over the past twelve months, the revenue reached $53 billion, although it reported an operational loss of $4.4 billion. While the outcome will significantly depend on how the results compare to expectations and consensus, being aware of historical trends might provide an advantage if you are a trader focused on events.
There are two approaches to consider: grasp the historical odds and position yourself before the earnings release, or examine the correlation between immediate and medium-term post-earnings returns and position accordingly after earnings are disclosed. If you desire upside with less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative, having outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception.

Some insights on one-day (1D) post-earnings returns:
Further details regarding observed 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns post-earnings are summarized along with the statistics in the table below.
A relatively lower-risk strategy (though not effective if the correlation is weak) is to comprehend the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns following earnings, identify a pair with the highest correlation, and execute the appropriate trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D demonstrate the highest correlation, a trader could take a ""long"" position for the next 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Below is some correlation data derived from a 5-year and a more recent 3-year history. Note that the correlation 1D_5D refers to the relationship between 1D post-earnings returns and consequent 5D returns.
Occasionally, the performance of peers can impact the stock’s reaction post-earnings. In fact, price adjustments might start occurring before the earnings announcement. Here is some historical data regarding the past post-earnings performance of Intel stock compared to the stock movements of peers that reported earnings just prior to Intel. For fair comparison, peer stock returns also reflect post-earnings one-day (1D) returns.

Alternatively, if you prefer upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock like Intel, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P and achieved over 105% returns since its inception."

    Has Apple chosen someone to fill the chief executive role once Tim Cook decides to retire? Here are a few candidates reportedly being considered.
  
Apple CEO Tim Cook visited Apple's Fifth Avenue store in New York in September 2025.
Tim Cook's 65th birthday is next month -- Nov. 1, to be exact -- and with the Apple CEO's special day looming, talks have been building regarding his potential successor. Cook has made no official public mention of retirement or stepping down yet, but according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, the tech giant is working behind the scenes to ensure a seamless transition when the time comes.
Cook replaced Steve Jobs in 2011, and after a period of uncertainty, Cook ushered Apple into its most profitable era. Stock-watching website Stocktwits reports that the company's stock increased by around 1,800% since Cook took over leading the company.
Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.
Jobs may have introduced devices like the iPhone into everyday use that changed how we interact with technology but Cook expanded on the Apple experience. Under his guidance, the company built upon Apple's smartphone by introducing subscription services and more mobile products, including earbuds and wearables.
He introduced Apple Pay, Beats headphones became part of the company's ecosystem, the Apple Watch launched 10 years ago and Apple even entered the entertainment business, producing original Oscar-winning movies and Emmy-winning TV shows through Apple TV Plus.

Tim Cook shows off the new orange iPhone 17 at 2025's Apple Event.
We should reiterate that the notion of Cook stepping down is pure speculation at this point. We don't know what Apple's CEO is currently planning or what his thoughts about retirement may be. That said, there are a handful of contenders who have reportedly been part of the succession conversation. 
Apple likely has ""a solid bench of successors"" that the company's board has been developing, says Bryan Ma, VP of Devices Research at IDC.
""But the anxiety gets amplified when there isn't clear visibility for such a valuable and iconic company,"" Ma says. ""Compounding the challenge is the fact that the bar has been set by big rock stars like Steve Jobs and Tim Cook. The next generation of leaders have very big shoes to fill.""
John Ternus, Apple's current vice president of Hardware Engineering, was top of Gurman's list. Ternus has been with the tech giant for more than two decades, so he has the knowledge and experience for a chief executive upgrade. There would be value in having an engineer behind the wheel. 
Ternus appeared during the September Apple event to introduce the iPhone Air. At 50, he's the same age Cook was when he took over as Apple CEO.
Other potential contenders are also being considered, including Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering; Greg Joswiak, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing; and Jeff Williams, the company's former chief operating officer, according to a report by Apple Insider. On Oct. 10, Bloomberg reported that Federighi also will soon be overseeing the Apple Watch operating system watchOS, while Ternus will be overseeing Apple Watch hardware engineering once Williams departs at the end of the year.
Federighi has been with Apple for a long time and has the public speaking experience -- frequently speaking during Apple Events -- that would be vital if he replaced Cook as CEO. Considering his current role, Joswiak has a more marketing perspective and a broader overview of the company and may not be as hands-on with the tech as Ternus and Federighi. And according to Gurman, Williams was viewed as a shoo-in to be Cook's replacement until his role as COO was announced to be ending. (He's now Apple's senior vice president of design, watch and health.) Cook held the position of chief operating officer before he replaced Jobs as CEO in 2011. Sabih Khan will be stepping into that COO role, which also puts his name in the running.
When Cook steps down, Apple will undoubtedly have a pool of qualified talent to choose from to take up the leadership mantle. Who exactly will take the mantle remains to be seen.
Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment."

Staring at another low-battery warning just when youâre about to leave home is the kind of modern frustration no one needs: A reliable wall charger (with several ports) has quietly become one of those gadgets we canât go a day without. Thatâs where the Baseus 100W USBâC wall charger comes in, and right now itâs sitting at an allâtime low price on Amazon: The threeâport power block has dropped to just $34, down from $49.99, as Amazon clears out the last of its postâPrime Day stock.
See at Amazon
The Baseus version produces up to 100W of charging juice in the form of a single USB-C outlet, which is enough to fast-charge a 16-inch MacBook Pro from dead to nearly full charge in roughly an hour and a half. It’s PD 3.0 protocol compatible meaning it speaks the same charging “language” that most current laptops, tablets, and phones speak so you get the maximum speed you can get without heating up your devices.
What’s more, its prongs are collapsible so it easily fits in a pocket or laptop sleeve and takes up very little real estate in a carry-on. It’s meant for the frequent flier or commuter who wouldn’t be interested in having some battery brick taking up valuable space on the wall or acting as luggage dead weight. And in the form of a charger for its rated capacity, it packs well – only slightly larger than your average singleâport telephone adapter.
If you’ve been struggling with having to tote up multiple chargers or are tired of lugging a laptop brick with you, the Baseus 100W wall charger is more than worth snapping up at this all-time low right now. Offers like this almost never stay around after the last batch goes through them, and this one hits almost all the right buttons.

LEGO has officially rolled out its full lineup of Advent calendars for 2025 and the holiday deals are already turning heads. As the countdown to December begins, several sets are seeing unexpected discounts but theyâre unlikely to last long. The LEGO Minecraft Advent calendar is now available at an allâtime low price of $26, down from $44.99, which makes it the cheapest LEGO Advent calendar on Amazon right now. With the popular City Advent Calendar already sold out, this Minecraft edition is now the bestâseller.
See at Amazon
One of the joys of the Advent season is the combination of excitement and reminiscence and that tiny moment each day when you pull back the wrapper on a new surprise in the runâup to Christmas. LEGO has made that experience a playtime ritual for youngsters and nostalgic adults in equal measure. The Minecraft Advent calendar brings the popular blocky world to the table with 24 buildable gifts designed to keep holiday mornings fun and creative.
Apart from the holiday break, the building setups and models are completely compatible with current LEGO Minecraft building sets. So the enjoyment needn’t cease at Christmas: it merely extends your child’s block-constructed world.
Amazon customers seem to agree, with the 2025 edition sporting a very respectable 4.8âstar rating. The reviews speak repeatedly about the value vs. fun equation, and specifically at this sale price. And with the holiday stock cycles for LEGO in view, the discount now seems less like an overstock sale and more like a scarce earlyâbird discount.
A word of caution: after Halloween, Advent calendars begin to disappear from the shelves of Amazon at lightening speed. Since this one happens to be at its allâtime lowest price and reduced in price by no less than 40% already, early shoppers are in for a treat since this is a total bargain.

We think there is little to worry about with AAPL stock considering its overall Strong operating performance and financial state despite its high valuation. 
While Apple’s growth has been middling in recent years, the company has bolstered its margins and improved per share earnings, driven by share buybacks. Moreover, the outlook appears stronger, with the latest iPhone 17 series seeing stronger than expected demand. 
Below is our evaluation:
 
Investing in a single stock can involve risks, but there is significant value in the broader diversified strategy we utilize with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. We extend our focus beyond just equities. We consider a portfolio that includes 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% cryptocurrency in addition to equities and bonds – likely to yield greater returns over the next 1-3 years while providing better protection if markets decline by 20%? We have analyzed the data.
Let’s delve into the details of each of the factors analyzed, but first, for a brief overview: With $3.7 Tril in market capitalization, Apple offers innovative smartphones, computers, tablets, wearables, accessories, and digital services like gaming, music, payments, and financial solutions for both consumers and various business sectors.
[1] Valuation Appears High
This table illustrates how AAPL is valued compared to the broader market. For further information, see: AAPL Valuation Ratios
[2] Growth Is Moderate
 
This table highlights how AAPL is growing in comparison to the broader market. For additional information see: AAPL Revenue Comparison
[3] Profitability Appears Very Strong
This table illustrates AAPL's profitability relative to the broader market. For further details see: AAPL Operating Income Comparison
[4] Financial Stability Appears Very Strong
 
[5] Downturn Resilience Is Strong
AAPL has shown more resilience than the S&P 500 index during different economic downturns. We evaluate this based on (a) the extent to which the stock declined and, (b) how quickly it bounced back.
2022 Inflation Shock
2020 Covid Pandemic
 
 
2008 Global Financial Crisis
 
However, the risks are not restricted to significant market downturns. Stocks tend to drop even when conditions are favorable – consider scenarios such as earnings, business announcements, and outlook modifications. Check out AAPL Dip Buyer Analyses to learn how the stock has bounced back from sharp declines in the past.
The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which consists of 30 stocks, has a proven history of consistently surpassing its benchmark, incorporating all three – S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. What leads to this performance? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; they offer a smoother experience, as demonstrated in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Salesforce stock (NYSE: CRM) offers a persuasive yet fully valued investment opportunity following the announcement of its recent revenue guidance for 2030. On October 16, 2025, shares increased by as much as 5% in extended trading after the company projected revenues to surpass $60 billion by 2030, exceeding the $58 billion consensus estimate from analysts. This guidance does not account for the pending $8 billion acquisition of Informatica, which was announced in May and is anticipated to be finalized in the upcoming quarters.
Although this development is positive, CRM stock is still down 28% year-to-date, reflecting investor worries about slowing revenue growth and uncertainty regarding the company's artificial intelligence (AI) strategy and plans for monetization.
The company exhibits strong operational performance marked by substantial profitability and financial stability; however, it trades at a premium valuation, which limits the potential for upside. Investors must consider whether the high multiples are warranted based on growth possibilities and the company’s capacity to effectively implement its AI roadmap.
That said, if you are looking for an upside with less volatility than owning individual stocks, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has significantly outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has delivered returns greater than 105% since its inception. Why is this the case? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided better returns with lower risk in comparison to the benchmark index; they offer a smoother investment experience, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
Salesforce holds premium valuations across essential metrics when compared to the S&P 500:
This premium pricing seems warranted due to superior operational performance, but it leaves little margin for error in case of disappointment.
Salesforce’s revenue growth profile indicates deceleration while still being above market averages:
The deceleration in growth from historical double-digit rates to high single-digits signifies a natural maturation phase for a company generating $40 billion in revenue, but it also raises doubts regarding the sustainability of its valuation.
Salesforce demonstrates remarkable profitability that supports its premium valuation:
These margins afford flexibility for strategic investments while returning capital to shareholders, which alleviates concerns regarding moderating growth.
The balance sheet shows no issues and provides strategic flexibility:
This financial strength enables Salesforce to pursue mergers and acquisitions while navigating economic uncertainties without diluting shareholder value.
Historical downturn performance highlights vulnerability despite strong fundamentals:
This pattern of volatility shows that the stock amplifies market movements, making timing crucial for investors. It’s important to recognize that investing in a single stock without thorough analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) and generated strong returns for investors. Why is this the case? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided an effective way to capitalize on favorable market conditions while minimizing losses during downturns, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.
Salesforce’s impressive profitability, financial stability, and consistent above-market growth justify its premium multiples; however, the current pricing offers limited upside. The 5% jump post-earnings suggests the market has a favorable view of the 2030 targets, yet the 28% decline year-to-date underscores ongoing investor skepticism regarding AI monetization and the potential for growth re-acceleration."
30,2025-10-16,"The average rate on a 30-year U.S. mortgage declined again this week, easing to just above its lowest level this year
The average rate on a 30-year U.S. mortgage declined again this week, easing to just above its lowest level this year.
The average long-term mortgage rate slipped to 6.27% from 6.3% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, the rate averaged 6.44%.
The latest dip brings the average rate to just above 6.26%, where it was four weeks ago after a string of declines brought down home loan borrowing costs to their lowest level since early October 2024.
Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, also eased this week. The average rate dropped to 5.52% from 5.53% last week. A year ago, it was 5.63%, Freddie Mac said.
Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors’ expectations for the economy and inflation. They generally follow the trajectory of the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.
The 10-year yield was at 4.02% at midday Thursday, down from around 4.14% the same time last week. 
Mortgage rates started declining in July in the lead-up to the Federal Reserve’s decision last month to cut its main interest rate for the first time in a year amid growing concern over the U.S. job market.
At their September policy meeting, Fed officials forecast that the central bank would reduce its rate twice more this year and once in 2026. Still, the Fed could change course if inflation jumps amid the Trump administration’s expanding use of tariffs and the recent trade war escalation with China.
Even if the Fed opts to cut its short-term rate further that doesn’t necessarily mean mortgage rates will keep declining. Last fall, after the Fed cut its rate for the first time in more than four years, mortgage rates marched higher, eventually reaching just above 7% in January this year.
The average rate on a 30-year mortgage has remained above 6% since September 2022, the year mortgage rates began climbing from historic lows. The housing market has been in a slump ever since. 
Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes sank last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years. So far this year, sales are running below where they were at this time in 2024.

United Airlines just threw a subtle jab at its two biggest rivals.
The carrier on Thursday said it was focused on a host of ""premium"" moves, including making sure its airport lounges don't get ""overcrowded"" — an obvious swipe at Delta Air Lines, which continues to face long lines outside some of its popular Sky Clubs.
But it didn't stop there. It tweaked American Airlines, too.
United, during its Thursday earnings call with investors, touted its growing number of seatback screens, saying that these are installed on more than 146,000 seats across 765 airplanes.
It's a not-so-subtle reminder that American stubbornly refuses to install seatback screens on most of its domestic fleet.
""These screens define a premium airline in the US,"" said United's executive vice president and chief commercial officer, Andrew Nocella. ""Our signature interior conversion is now at 64% and an investment of over $1.6 billion.""
The comments came after a choppy year for airlines, with President Donald Trump's positions on tariffs and other controversial issues said to be putting a damper on demand for some international flying.
United's SVP of global network planning and alliances, Patrick Quayle, told the media in October that the airline has seen some decline in foreign points of sale. Still, he said, transatlantic demand remains strong overall, with more than 80% of its seats purchased by people in the US.
United is trying to position itself as the more premium option among the Big 3, emphasizing comfort and exclusivity as the airlines compete for high-paying premium and business travelers.
United said its premium cabin revenue rose about 6% year-over-year in the third quarter, though that was less than Delta's 9%.
Meanwhile, Delta has acknowledged the record crowds at its more than 50 Sky Clubs worldwide and has made changes, though some have annoyed customers.
In 2023, it raised annual lounge pass prices by $150, increased guest fees, and restricted access for basic economy passengers unless they had the right credit card.
Hoping to split the crowds between the two upscale products, Delta is also rolling out a new tier of exclusivity: ""Delta One"" lounges, which are more high-end than its Sky Clubs. As of 2025, there are only four locations: New York-JFK, Boston, Los Angeles, and Seattle.
Responding to a request for comment from Business Insider, a Delta spokesperson said: ""We are always evaluating our policies and strategy to ensure the best possible Club experience. We continue to track impact of previous policy changes and strive to ensure an unparalleled Club experience for our valued members.""
Meanwhile, American has stayed steadfast in its mostly anti-seatback entertainment stance. (It has in-flight entertainment on large planes that fly overseas, and on certain transcontinental flights.) But on most of its domestic workhorse fleet, it's instead installed tablet holders so passengers can stream entertainment on their own devices. This saves money on weight and fuel.
Some people — including this reporter — prefer it this way.
""Over 90% of our customers already fly with their own devices — ones they upgrade, know, and prefer,"" an American spokesperson told Business Insider. ""As such, American is focused on investing in fast connections and free entertainment, enjoyed on the devices our customers choose.""
The spokesperson added that all AAdvantage loyalty members will get free WiFi starting next year.
On Thursday, United's stock was down more than 7% after it posted better-than-expected earnings figures, but revenue numbers that fell short of what analysts had expected.
Still, its stock is up more than 34% over the past year.Delta, which also reported earnings last week, is up around 6.5% over the past year. American, which is set to report earnings next week, is down nearly 8.6%.

32,2025-10-16,"Apple just launched its brand new M5 MacBook Pro, but with very few changes compared to last year’s M4 model. If you’re in the market to upgrade, rumors indicate that next year’s M6 MacBook Pro should be well worth the extra wait.
The M5 MacBook Pro is, by all appearances, a very minor spec bump update. And that’s not altogether a bad thing. It’s always good to get a new, more powerful chip even if little else changes.
But where the M5 MacBook Pro is lacking in new features, next year’s M6 model is expected to go big with noteworthy changes.
Here’s a rundown of the latest rumored features:
Normally, users might look for 2-3 tentpole additions in a new model. If current rumors pan out, the M6 MacBook Pro is going to have a whole lot more to offer.
The hardware redesign alone is a big deal, since the MacBook Pro hasn’t changed its look since 2021’s bulky “apology model” arrived. Advancements in Apple silicon hopefully will make thinner possible without any butterfly keyboard-style compromises.
Apple’s M6 chip is expected to be a larger than usual processor upgrade. A new 2-nanometer process and other packaging innovations should combine to enable unique gains.
The current MacBook Pro display is solid, but who wouldn’t take something better? 
Getting OLED, touch support, and the notch’s removal all in one year should make the M6 model’s display very compelling.
And rumors indicate Apple might bring cellular capabilities to the Mac next year too, with the M6 MacBook Pro offering a next-generation C2 modem.
All of this easily adds up to one of the biggest Mac updates ever.
If you don’t need a new MacBook Pro right away, Apple’s upcoming model should be well worth another year’s wait.
Are you planning to buy an M5 MacBook Pro, or wait for the M6 model? Let us know in the comments.

Bath & Body Works stock (NYSE: BBWI) has decreased by 33% year to date, in contrast to a 13% increase in the S&P 500. What drives this sharp decline? A combination of waning consumer demand, pressure on margins, and investor fatigue. While the valuation of the company may seem appealing, that doesn’t guarantee stability.
On the surface, the stock appears inexpensive. BBWI is trading at merely 7.7 times earnings, 0.7 times sales, and 6.9 times free cash flow—significantly lower than the S&P 500 averages of 23.6x earnings, 3.2x sales, and 20.6x free cash flow. On paper, it appears to be a value buy. However, this doesn’t imply it will be shielded when the market faces challenges.
With markets hovering near all-time highs, numerous investors are inclined to view BBWI's downturn as a chance to buy. But let’s take a moment to reflect—historically, the potential downside risk may be much greater than it currently seems. We elaborate on this further below.
Nevertheless, if you seek upward potential with reduced volatility compared to owning a solitary stock like BBWI, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has notably outperformed its benchmark—a composite of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its establishment. What contributes to this? Collectively, the HQ Portfolio stocks have offered superior returns with diminished risk compared to the benchmark index, avoiding significant fluctuations, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Additionally, take a look at –Buy AVGO Stock After 10% Drop?
BBWI might seem inexpensive, but just the price alone doesn’t ensure safety. Revenue has stagnated, with a decline of 1.8% on average over three years and only 0.2% over the last twelve months on $7.4 billion in sales—barely the momentum you desire. Margins are reasonable but facing pressure: 17.1% operating margin, 9.9% net, and 13.6% cash flow, indicating that even minor revenue declines can significantly affect earnings. And regarding the balance sheet? It’s thin. $5 billion in debt against a $5.4 billion market cap, with merely $364 million in cash. One decline in spending, and flexibility is lost.
During the inflation shock in 2022, BBWI stock plummeted nearly 67% from its zenith while the S&P 500 only fell 25%. Even after a partial recovery, it has not returned to its previous highs. In the pandemic of 2020, BBWI decreased by 63%, albeit it quickly bounced back once stimulus measures boosted consumer spending. Furthermore, during the 2008 financial crisis, the stock fell by 79%, significantly worse than the market average, taking over two years to rebound.
This trend isn’t accidental. Bath & Body Works incessantly experiences disproportionate losses during every substantial downturn. It exemplifies a cyclical retailer that flourishes in prosperous times but collapses when consumer spending tightens.
At approximately $26 per share, BBWI may appear priced for vulnerability—but history suggests otherwise. In past downturns, the stock's losses surpassed 60%. A similar decline would bring the shares closer to $10, emphasizing how susceptible the stock remains to changes in spending habits or market sentiment.
This is not an act of fearmongering; it’s a dose of realism. The stock has repeatedly demonstrated sensitivity to macroeconomic pressures. When growth slows or interest rates rise, BBWI doesn’t merely decline—it plummets.
The intent of this analysis is not to drive you away from BBWI. It aims to underscore the authentic downside risk. While such a scenario may or may not materialize, the likelihood is not negligible. You are not investing in a defensive business with stable cash flows; you are wagering on a consumer revival strong enough to counteract soft growth and high leverage.
If this level of risk makes you uncomfortable, you might want to explore the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has exceeded its all-cap benchmark (a mixture of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to provide solid returns for investors. What contributes to this success? The rebalanced combination of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offers a versatile strategy that capitalizes on favorable market conditions while controlling losses during market downturns, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics."

Alphabet (GOOGL) has faced setbacks in the past. Its stock fell by over 30% within a timeframe of fewer than 2 months in 2022, erasing billions in market capitalization and wiping out significant profits in one correction. If the past serves as any indication, Alphabet (GOOGL) stock is susceptible to unexpected and severe declines.
Investing in a single stock can be precarious, but significant value lies in the broader diversified strategy we utilize with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Allow us to pose this question: Over the past 5 years, which index do you suppose the Trefis High Quality Portfolio has outperformed — the S&P 500, S&P 1500 Equal Weighted, or both? The response may surprise you. Discover how our advisory framework helps tip the scales in your favor.
It certainly assists in mitigating the risk if the fundamentals appear sound. For insights on GOOGL, check Buy or Sell GOOGL Stock. Below are a few important figures.
*LTM: Last Twelve Months
When evaluating risk for GOOGL, examining how much it declined during major market downturns is beneficial. The most significant fall was during the Global Financial Crisis, where it dropped approximately 65%. The Inflation Shock in 2022 also pushed the shares down about 44%. The Covid pandemic caused a decline of nearly 31%, and the 2018 correction wasn’t minor either, reflecting a 23% decrease. These statistics indicate that although GOOGL is robust in terms of fundamentals, it isn't immune to unfavorable market conditions. Such substantial drawdowns should be taken into account, even for prominent companies.
The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has demonstrated a track record of consistently outperforming its benchmark that spans all 3 indices — the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000. What accounts for this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided superior returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; it’s a smoother investment journey, as evidenced by HQ Portfolio performance metrics."

Ferrari (RACE) stock has fallen 19% during the past week, and is currently trading at $389.56. Our machine-driven multi-factor assessment suggests that it may be time to reduce exposure to RACE stock. We are primarily concerned current valuation and a price of $273 may not be out of reach. We believe there is not much to fear in RACE stock given its overall Strong operating performance and financial condition. But given its Very High valuation, the stock appears Relatively Expensive.
Below is our assessment:
RACE stock has fallen meaningfully recently and we currently find it relatively expensive. While this may feel like an opportunity, there is significant risk in relying on a single stock. On the other hand, there is a huge value to a broader diversified approach we take with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Should you buy one stock you like or build a portfolio designed to win across cycles? Our numbers show that High Quality Portfolio has turned stock-picking uncertainty into market-beating consistency. This portfolio is incorporated in asset allocation strategy of Empirical Asset Management - a Boston area wealth manager and Trefis partner - whose asset allocation framework yielded positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P lost more than 40%.
Let's get into details of each of the assessed factors but before that, for quick background: With $70 Bil in market cap, Ferrari provides luxury performance sports cars, licenses the brand for lifestyle goods, and operates retail stores and themed entertainment parks globally.
RACE has been more resilient than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. We assess this based on both (a) how much the stock fell and, (b) how quickly it recovered.
2022 Inflation Shock
2020 Covid Pandemic
The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming its benchmark that includes all 3 - S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics."

 Stock futures are pointing to a higher open for major indexes as investors digest a flurry of corporate earnings reports, while gold continues hitting new highs; Walmart (WMT) shares are higher after closing at record highs the last two days following news of the retailer's collaboration with OpenAI; Salesforce (CRM) shares are gaining after the company issued new long-term revenue projections; Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) shares are rising as strong AI chip demand continues to fuel sales growth; and Nestlé is laying off 16,000 workers. Here's what you need to know today.

 Stock futures are higher as strong earnings reports from banks continue to roll in. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.2% recently, after the blue chip index closed fractionally lower yesterday. Futures linked to the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq, both of which finished higher on Wednesday, were up 0.4% and 0.6%, respectively, this morning. Gold was up 1.4% at $4,260 an ounce, as investors continue pouring money into the safe-haven asset amid stock market volatility and economic uncertainty. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) was little changed at $111,600, trading near its lowest levels of the month and well below the record high of $126,000 set early last week. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on a array of loans, was at 4.01%, down from 4.04% yesterday.

 Walmart (WMT) shares are slightly higher in premarket trading after closing at record highs the past two sessions following news the retail giant would team up with ChatGPT developer OpenAI. The collaboration, announced Tuesday, will allow shoppers to discover and buy items via instant checkout directly through the AI platform. The stock has gained 21% so far this year, outpacing broader market returns, as the retailer has benefitted from strong e-commerce sales and demand across income levels amid economic uncertainty. Walmart shares were up 0.1% before the opening bell, after gaining nearly 7% over the previous two sessions.

 Salesforce (CRM) shares are surging in premarket trading after the customer relationship software maker announced new long-term revenue targets as part of its annual conference. Salesforce said it expects $60 billion in revenue in 2030, which would reflect an annual growth rate of around 10%. The projections exclude impacts from the company’s $8 billion acquisition of data management software provider Informatica. The fresh outlook comes after the cloud-based software company recently issued current-quarter growth projections that came in below expectations. Salesforce shares, which come into today's session down roughly 30% so far in 2025, were up nearly 6% in recent trading.

 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) reported a huge increase in third-quarter revenue as the chipmaker continued to see strong demand amid the AI spending boom. TSMC posted third-quarter revenue of $33.10 billion, up 41% from the year-ago period and 10% from the second quarter this year. The company is forecasting fourth-quarter revenue of between $32.2 billion and $33.4 billion.  TSMC shares were up 2% in recent premarket trading.

 Nestlé announced plans to cut 16,000 jobs over the next two years. About 12,000 of the eliminated will be in white-collar roles, while the remainder will be manufacturing and supply chain jobs. Nestlé said it expects to save CHF 1.0 billion ($1.256 billion) by the end of 2027. The move by new CEO Philipp Navratil comes after the company dismissed its former chief executive in September over an undisclosed relationship with a subordinate. Nestlé shares traded in Switzerland moved sharply higher Thursday.

Salesforce. “Salesforce Announces New FY30 Revenue Target of $60B+, 10% Organic FY26-FY30 CAGR.”
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. “TSMC Reports Third Quarter EPS of NT$17.44.”

U.S. stocks were mixed Wednesday as investors weigh an ongoing trade conflict, a government shutdown, hopes for lower interest rates and optimism for AI demand.
The large-cap S&P 500 index rose 0.4%, the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the blue-chip index, was nearly flat.
Trade tensions remain high between the U.S. and China, though a scheduled meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping appears to be back on track. Meanwhile, the U.S. government shutdown continues. Polymarket prediction market odds currently say the government will remain closed until after November 16. Polymarket users have also weighed in on the Fed’s next meeting, putting 95% odds on a quarter-point interest rate reduction. 
On the earnings front, Taiwan Semiconductor beat the third quarter consensus and raised its 2025 revenue growth outlook — a positive development for AI investors banking on continued AI demand. 
Stock futures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones are up ahead of the market open on Thursday. Contracts tied to the S&P 500 rose 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures gained 0.6%. Dow Jones futures rose 0.3%. 
Taiwan Semiconductor, the world’s largest chip foundry, reported its performance for the third quarter of 2025 before the market opened Thursday. Charles Schwab, The Bank of New York Mellon, and U.S. Bancorp are also on the reporting calendar for October 16. 
What is a good D/E ratio? Debt-to-equity or the D/E ratio compares a company’s debt to its equity. Debt and equity are the two primary funding sources for business capital. How a company chooses to combine these two capital sources influences its financial health and the risk it poses as an investment. 
Low D/E ratios are generally better than high ones. A low D/E ratio means more equity and less debt. Too much debt can make a business less resilient in downturns due to a smaller equity cushion plus the burden of larger loan repayments. 
The exception to the lower-is-better rule is when a company forgoes essential growth initiatives to avoid borrowing. Telecom, energy, aerospace, retail, hospitality, real estate and other industries require generous debt loads to compete. For example, a hotel chain must buy or develop more properties — two capital-intensive strategies — to grow.  
Many analysts prefer D/E ratios below 2, with exceptions for capital-intensive business models. 
You can calculate the D/E ratio as total liabilities divided by shareholder equity. Both values are on the balance sheet, so the ratio quantifies the company’s leverage as of the last day of the reporting period. 
The D/E ratio is comparative. What’s good in one industry may be awful in another. To understand a company’s D/E ratio, compare it to: 
Grocery store operator Albertsons has a D/E ratio of 4.7, while competitor Kroger’s is 2.7.  Software providers Salesforce and SAP have much lower leverage ratios at 0.19 and 0.21, respectively."

Following disappointing sales of the Galaxy S25 Edge, Samsung has reportedly decided to cancel the launch of the Galaxy S26 Edge next year.
Samsung introduced the Galaxy S25 Edge earlier this year as part of its flagship lineup, positioning it as a slim, lightweight smartphone that still offered top-tier performance. The move was seen as a response to Apple's new iPhone Air, aimed at fans of thinner devices. However, the Galaxy S25 Edge failed to perform well commercially.
Reports earlier this month indicated that Samsung had already reduced production of the Galaxy S25 Edge due to sluggish sales. Moreover, the phone is now available at a 40% discount on Amazon, just five months after launch, as Samsung continues to try to boost demand.
But according to a new report from South Korea's Newspim (via Jukanlosreve on X), Samsung has already decided to discontinue the ""Edge"" lineup altogether.
The report claims that Samsung has scrapped plans for the Galaxy S26 Edge, meaning next year's Galaxy S26 lineup will once again consist of three models: the Galaxy S26 Pro (base model), Galaxy S26 Plus, and Galaxy S26 Ultra.
 



The report even goes on to claim that once the remaining Galaxy S25 Edge inventory is sold out, Samsung does not plan to manufacture any additional units. A senior Samsung executive reportedly told the publication, ""I'm not sure if the slim line will ever return, but as of now, it seems unlikely. It's practically gone.""
Interestingly, Samsung had already started development on the Galaxy S26 Edge, which raises the possibility that it could still appear at a later date — though the report suggests this is highly unlikely now.

Earlier leaks suggested that Samsung was planning to replace the Plus model with the Edge version in the Galaxy S26 lineup. However, those plans appear to have changed last month, when reports indicated that Samsung had resumed development of the Galaxy S26 Plus. With the S26 Edge now reportedly canceled, it seems Samsung is reverting to its traditional three-phone lineup.
There are still several months to go before Samsung officially unveils the Galaxy S26 series, but if these reports are accurate, it's safe to say goodbye to the short-lived Edge lineup.
 




At an all-time low
The Galaxy S25 Edge offers a powerful processor in a thin and light form factor. It features a 6.7-inch display and offers a premium experience despite a few compromises. The S25 Edge also carries over many features from Samsung's top-tier lineup, including the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, a 200MP camera, and the latest version of One UI, making it an appealing option for those who value both performance and sleek design.

If you didnât get a chance to treat yourself to a brand-new pair of earbuds for less on Prime Day, donât worry. One of our favorite in-ear options, the Beats Studio Buds, is back on sale. Right now, you can grab them for just $90 on Amazon, down from their usual $150 price tag.
Thatâs a solid $60 discount on the black color. Itâs close to the drops we saw during the big sale events this year, so now is an excellent time to upgrade. Just be sure to grab yourself a pair before the stock ends or the retailer decides to push the price back up to $150.
See at Amazon
This pair gets you two listening modes: Active Noise Canceling mode and Transparency mode. Since the brand calls these âtrue wireless noise canceling earbuds,â the ANC mode is the main selling point, and it does a great job at blocking all external noise to give you an immersive listening experience. This mode is great for when you want to disconnect from the world for a while and dive deep into whatever is playing. It could be your favorite song or a Lo-Fi playlist to help you study while tuning everything else out.
The transparency mode, on the other hand, is great for when you do want to stay connected to your surroundings while still enjoying solid audio. It lets ambient sound in, keeping you aware of whatâs happening around. But regardless of the mode you choose, sound quality stays rich, deep, and clear. Built-in microphones make taking calls easy, and even let you interact with voice assistants for some hands-free control.
Beat Studio Buds are IPX4-rated sweat- and water-resistant, so a few splashes here and there wonât hurt. Wear them on a rainy day, during intense workouts, or on a long beach day without worrying about damaging them. And speaking of long days, youâre looking at around 8 hours of listening time on a single charge. That extends to 24 hours total with the pocket-sized charging case.
These also play nicely with both Apple and Android devices, so compatibility wonât be an issue, even though Beats is owned by Apple.
All things considered, the Beat Studio Buds can be a great investment for anyone looking for better sound, different listening modes, and a solid battery life. Youâre getting all that and more with these. Donât miss the chance to grab for less while you can.

Hims & Hers stock (NYSE: HIMS) increased by 16% yesterday following its announcement about expanding into the treatment of menopause and perimenopause—a strategic shift indicating that the company is creating revenue sources beyond its debated compounded GLP-1 obesity treatments. With shares already up 150% year-to-date and trading at approximately $60, the critical question now is: could HIMS stock go up another 2x to $120?
It’s an ambitious target, but let’s explore if the calculations actually support this. Before delving into the numbers, if you are looking for upside with less volatility than owning an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has significantly outperformed its benchmark—a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is this the case? As a whole, stocks within the HQ Portfolio have delivered better returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster experience, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
Here’s the intriguing aspect of HIMS—it’s not performing like a conventional high-growth stock. At 7.6x trailing revenues, the multiple appears almost conservative given the company’s offerings. When compared to other high-growth healthcare companies, you’d expect to see a multiple closer to 12-15x for this type of momentum.
So, what’s the route to doubling? It boils down to two factors: revenue growth and multiple expansion.
Can revenues hit $4 billion by 2028?
The company recently reported $2.0 billion in trailing twelve-month revenue, marking an increase of 88.7% from $1.1 billion. That’s not a typo—nearly 90% growth. The latest quarter demonstrated $545 million in sales, a 72.6% increase from $316 million a year prior. Refer to Hims & Hers Revenue Comparison for further information. This growth is primarily fueled by compounded GLP-1s, which have gained considerable popularity as lower-cost alternatives to Wegovy and Zepbound.
Analysts anticipate 58% growth this year and 20% the following year, but these predictions were formulated prior to the menopause/perimenopause launch. If HIMS can maintain a compound annual growth rate of even 25%-30% over the next three years—which appears feasible given its three-year average of 76.3%—then achieving $4 billion in revenue by 2028 is genuinely attainable, perhaps even conservative.
What happens to the multiple?
Here’s where it becomes intriguing. If revenue reaches $4 billion and the stock remains at $60, you’d be looking at merely 3.8x sales. This would position HIMS as one of the least expensive growth narratives in healthcare. However, that’s not how markets typically operate, right?
More plausibly, as the revenue foundation expands and diversifies with the menopause sector, the multiple may modestly compress to around 6x. Do the calculation: 6x times $4 billion equals a $24 billion market capitalization. With approximately 245 million shares outstanding, that pushes the price to above $100—and that’s assuming the multiple actually decreases from current levels.
But wait—shouldn’t the multiple actually expand? For a company that consistently grows by over 75% annually, a 7.6x revenue multiple seems to indicate substantial risk. This brings us to the pertinent question...
What’s Holding Back the Multiple?
However, until sustained profitability improvements are evident, the market won’t grant HIMS a premium SaaS-like revenue multiple. Growth is impressive, but investors want to witness a pathway to substantial earnings power.
The menopause launch is a clever strategy as it addresses the most significant concerns: over-dependence on compounded GLP-1s. Undoubtedly, the company has additional revenue streams, including sexual health, mental health, and dermatology, among others. Menopause and perimenopause impact millions of women; it’s an underserved market, and HIMS’s direct-to-consumer approach is ideally suited for those conditions where patients often feel stigmatized when seeking traditional care.
If this sector can produce even $500-750 million in annual revenue within 2-3 years, HIMS would start to appear less like a one-dimensional entity reliant on favorable regulations and more like a legitimate, multi-faceted telehealth provider.
HIMS has constructed an infrastructure encompassing a telehealth platform, pharmacy fulfillment, and customer relationships. Every new sector they introduce capitalizes on that existing framework. The CAC to acquire a menopause customer diminishes if that customer is already utilizing HIMS for dermatological or hair loss needs. Cross-selling becomes incredibly effective. This is where the business model begins to look remarkably appealing.
Remember, investing in a single stock without thorough analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stock benchmark (a mix of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to yield strong returns for investors. Why is this the case? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offered a responsive approach to capitalize on favorable market conditions while minimizing losses when markets decline, as elaborated in RV Portfolio performance metrics.
Can HIMS double to $120? The mathematical pathway exists. Reach $4 billion in revenue with solid execution, maintain a 6x multiple, and you’re looking at $100-120 per share within three years. That’s not an unrealistic scenario—it’s actually quite conservative given the growth trajectory.
However, here’s the catch: the valuation seems low because the risks are genuine. The FDA's imminent scrutiny over compounded GLP-1s is serious, and until HIMS demonstrates it can generate significant revenue outside that sphere, investors will keep the multiple suppressed.
The menopause launch is a strategic move. If it is successful—and if the regulatory environment remains favorable for another 12-18 months—HIMS could undoubtedly double. But if the FDA acts before the company diversifies, this stock could fall by half before it has the chance to double.
Placing a bet on HIMS at the current levels essentially amounts to a wager on timing: can management establish a diversified revenue base before regulators put an end to the compounded GLP-1 advantage? For investors with a higher risk tolerance who believe the answer is yes, the risk-reward dynamic appears compelling. For everyone else, it may be prudent to wait and observe how the menopause launch performs over the next two quarters."

Bitdeer Technologies stock (NASDAQ: BTDR) soared by 29% on October 15 after the announcement of its expansion into data center operations and provisioning. This strategic shift goes beyond the company’s conventional Bitcoin mining and high-performance rig sales.
This transition reflects an emerging trend among Bitcoin miners. In light of the AI boom, there is a significant demand for data centers. Miners are in a unique position to satisfy this requirement for AI high-performance computing (HPC) by utilizing their existing infrastructure, technical skills, and power resources. By catering to AI needs, miners can establish a more consistent revenue stream and potentially attain higher profit margins compared to traditional mining. This evolution is advantageous for the miners, offering a more valuable business model, and also for the AI sector, which benefits from much-needed computational capacity.
Considering the recent events and the stock's response, the vital question is whether BTDR stock is a purchase at prices above $26. Although the current valuation seems considerably high, we believe the potential for robust growth is significant. We’ll explore this further, including the company’s operational and financial performance, in the subsequent sections.
However, if you are looking for an upside with less volatility than investing in an individual stock like BTDR, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has realized returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is this the case? As a collective, the HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; less volatility, as illustrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
Based on what you pay per dollar of sales or earnings, BTDR stock appears very overpriced compared to the broader market.
Bitdeer Technologies’ revenues have seen modest growth over recent years.
Bitdeer Technologies’ profit margins are significantly lower than most companies within the Trefis coverage universe.
Bitdeer Technologies’ balance sheet appears very solid.
BTDR stock has performed worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent declines. While investors are hopeful for a gentle landing by the U.S. economy, what could happen if another recession occurs? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash illustrates how key stocks performed during and after the last six market crashes.
In conclusion, Bitdeer Technologies’ performance across the metrics outlined above is as follows:
• Growth: Inconsistent• Profitability: Very Weak• Financial Stability: Very Strong• Downturn Resilience: Weak• Overall: Weak
Thus, investing in a single stock without a thorough analysis can be hazardous. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has surpassed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to deliver solid returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced blend of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided an adaptable way to capitalize on favorable market conditions while minimizing losses when markets decline, as explained in RV Portfolio performance metrics.
On the surface, Bitdeer Technologies’ stock may appear unappealing, considering the company’s historically poor performance in crucial financial metrics and its currently very high valuation. Nevertheless, a closer inspection unveils a compelling growth narrative.
First, revenue growth is noticeably accelerating. Consensus projections anticipate revenue to spike by 65% in 2025 and an impressive 89% in 2026. When you take these forward revenue forecasts into account, the current Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio becomes significantly more justifiable.
Second, the core mining business is making strides. Last month, the company mined 452 Bitcoins, up from 375 in August. As Bitcoin prices increase, this not only enhances mining revenue but also elevates the value of the company’s overall assets. Furthermore, profitability remains stable, with the adjusted EBITDA margin maintaining at 11% in both 2024 and Q2 of 2025.
In summary, there’s more to Bitdeer than initially perceived. Despite its recent stock increase, we believe it still represents a sound investment. While our assessment might be incorrect, and investors must carefully consider all risks—particularly given the stock’s history of significant downturns—we think BTDR has the potential to deliver substantial returns for an investor with a 3-5 year outlook."

From a quantitative perspective, the 77.2% change in NVIDIA (NVDA) stock from 4/18/2025 to 10/15/2025 was chiefly motivated by a 48.4% change in the company’s P/E Multiple. While there is more to this narrative than mere numbers, let’s first analyze the stock price movements by examining its contributing elements.
Investing in a single stock can be risky, yet a significantly diversified approach offers great value, such as the one we adopt with Trefis High-Quality Portfolio. Should you invest in a single stock you like or create a portfolio designed for success across market cycles? Our data illustrates that the High Quality Portfolio has transformed stock-picking uncertainties into consistent market-beating performance. This portfolio is integrated into the asset allocation strategy of Empirical Asset Management – a Boston-based wealth manager and Trefis partner – whose asset allocation framework produced positive returns during the 2008-09 timeframe when the S&P declined by more than 40%.
Returning to the “change”: the alterations in fundamental factors such as valuation, revenues, and profit margins have an underlying narrative regarding business and investor sentiment. Below, we have pinpointed crucial developments that affected the stock price movement for NVDA stock. Before that, as a brief background: NVDA provides graphics, computing, and networking solutions for the gaming, professional visualization, datacenter, and automotive sectors globally, in addition to a strategic partnership with Kroger Co.
Opinion: We currently consider NVDA stock appealing yet volatile. Why is that? Take a look at the complete narrative. Read Buy or Sell NVDA Stock to understand what drives our current view.
Risk: That said, Nvidia isn’t exempt from significant declines. It dropped 68% during the Dot-Com bubble and suffered an even steeper decline of 85% during the Global Financial Crisis. During the inflation shock, it declined approximately 66%, while the corrections in 2018 and the Covid pandemic pulled it down by 56% and 38%, respectively. Even with strong fundamentals, Nvidia’s history indicates it can incur steep losses when market conditions turn.
Consistently selecting winners is a challenging endeavor – particularly given the volatility linked with a single stock. Instead, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a collection of 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four-year period. What is the reason for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have historically yielded better returns with less risk when compared to the benchmark index; showcasing a more stable performance as highlighted in HQ Portfolio performance metrics."

    ""Studio-grade sound"" was the goal. A mobile Dolby Atmos studio is the result.
  
Using Mercedes vehicles, Universal's talent and Dolby's tech, the three companies hope to drive the listener experience forward. Dolby is no stranger to car audio, helping to add Atmos to the location where most people listen to most of their music. Universal is, well, universal, covering legendary labels like Interscope, Capitol, Def Jam, Abbey Road Studios and many others. Mercedes, you also may have heard of: It's been building cars for almost 140 years. 
The pitch from this high-profile triumvirate was to make a vehicle audio system so close to that of a studio that creatives could use it to finalize mixes, notably Atmos Music mixes. To that end, some journalists, including myself, were invited down to Interscope's studios in Santa Monica, California. Once there, we listened to an Atmos-mixed music track in a big space with big speakers, then a smaller studio with an elaborate (and great-sounding) PMC speaker system, and finally the same track inside a Mercedes-Maybach sedan. 
Now, it's not like we could A-B compare them instantly back-to-back, nor were they volume matched, nor did I know the song, and forget about blind testing, but in fairness, there were a lot of similarities between the studio sound and the Maybach. The car sounded amazing, as you'd hope for something that costs more than I paid for my house. Is this all just a marketing gimmick? Well, not exactly.
The back of this Maybach has USB and HDMI connections to get a laptop fully connected while running a digital audio workstation like Pro Tools with video and spatial audio for what it's calling a ""fully equipped Dolby Atmos sound studio.""
Checking a mix in a car is not new. Even back when I was studying audio production, we were advised to check any mixes on a variety of audio systems. After all, just because something sounds great in a pristine studio doesn't mean it will sound right on a boombox, through headphones or in a car.  
The ""Crafted in a Mercedes"" setup is infinitely beyond the days when I'd dump a mix to a cassette and try it in my Volkswagen. At the announcement event in Santa Monica, I sat in the back of the Mercedes-Maybach with Aron Forbes, mixer and producer for artists such as Billie Eilish, Halsey and many others. Using his personal laptop running Pro Tools connected to the Maybach, he played a track by Finneas. With this setup, there was no need to go back into the studio to adjust anything. Instead, he could make any tweaks necessary to the mix from the vehicle because the Maybach has Atmos, including a height speaker in between the two glass roofs. 
Aron Forbes checking playback. Playing in the back, PMC speakers.
Screens on the backs of the front seats showed the Dolby Atmos mixing interface, displaying where the virtual speakers were. If the artist were with him instead of yours truly, this would certainly make things easier than constantly leaning across the sizable middle armrest to point at things on the laptop's screen.  
Part of the Atmos plugin as shown on the backseat screen in a Maybach.
Car audio is big business. Far bigger business than home audio. I've been told by several traditional speaker manufacturers that the sales of their entire home speaker line are barely a rounding error compared to their car audio business.
In the last few years, Samsung has made extensive inroads into the car audio market. With the purchase of Harman International, it already owned the majority of the market, and since then, it's been gobbling up audio brands like candy. At this point, unless it's Bose (and its subsidiaries), or Focal-JMLab (ditto), it's likely Samsung/Harman regardless of the branding. With very few exceptions, notably for this story the Maybach's Burmester system, there are basically three main companies for all ""high-end"" car audio.  
A Burmester tweeter in the A-pillar.
At least for now, all are doing a decent job of making car audio sound as good as possible. Car audio is difficult in a lot of ways, and if you don't remember what radios sounded like in older cars, consider yourself lucky. 
So there are really two versions of the same question here: Will we get more Dolby Atmos in cars, and will that lead to more Dolby Atmos music, or will we get more Atmos music, and that will lead to more Atmos car audio systems? My guess is the former. If there's demand, or if it makes it more likely consumers will upgrade to the higher-end system in their next car, you can bet you'll start seeing more of it. 
Spatial audio makes a lot of sense in the car. Unlike most homes, there are already multiple speakers arranged in a layout roughly conducive to surround sound. Where can you get the content, though? Given how long it took Spotify to add lossless audio, I wouldn't hold my breath that it'll add Atmos any time soon. So that leaves Apple Music, Amazon and Tidal for Atmos mixes. 
The Burmester system in this Mercedes-Maybach S-Class has 31 drivers powered by 1,750 watts. If you're wondering, ""Where did it put the drivers?"" the answer is everywhere. It put them everywhere.
As far as Crafted in a Mercedes goes, Mercedes has said aspects of this setup, like specific control of the speakers, are being considered for production. So, for now, you can't have a rolling Atmos studio of your own unless you're really enthusiastic about DIYing a van with speakers and acoustic treatments. Hopefully, we'll see Atmos in some less opulent vehicles. 
While the point of the visit was the car and the collab, I love recording studios. There's a certain aesthetic that's common among all the ones I've visited. I'll call it ""creative cozy."" Here are some additional pics in case you're curious.
This is Dr. Dre's own console, which he used for The Chronic, Eminem's Slim Shady LP and many others. This studio was built specifically for Kendrick Lamar.

GE Vernova (NYSE: GEV), the newly independent energy and electrification giant spun off from General Electric, has rapidly emerged as one of the most captivating industrial narratives in the market. Shares currently trade around $640, having increased significantly since the April 2024 listing, as investors flock to opportunities associated with the global energy transition and AI-driven power demand. Yet, with valuations soaring, many are questioning: can GE Vernova continue to ascend—or is it already fully valued?
However, if you are looking for an upside with less volatility than owning an individual stock, take a look at the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns of over 105% since its launch. As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; providing a steadier ride, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Additionally, see Can PayPal Stock Fall To $50?
For GE Vernova’s stock price to reach the $1,000 level, investors would need to witness a combination of robust revenue growth, significant margin expansion, and persistent belief in its long-term earnings potential. The company is anticipated to generate about $37 billion in revenue in 2025, but if management successfully implements its strategy across gas power, grid, and electrification, total revenue could rise to approximately $55–60 billion by 2028. If operating margins enhance towards the mid-teens, that would equate to net income of around $6–7 billion.
Should investors continue to value the company as a leading high-growth energy transition player instead of a conventional industrial entity, a forward P/E ratio of 50×—akin to the current premium valuation—would suggest an equity value in the vicinity of $900–1,000 per share.
In essence, achieving $1,000 is not implausible, but it relies on GE Vernova maintaining rapid revenue growth, enhancing profitability to top-tier standards, and preserving its growth-stock valuation multiple. Any degradation in execution or compression of that multiple would render the target significantly more difficult to attain.
At $640 per share, GE Vernova is valued like a leader in energy transformation—not a turnaround story. The company’s fundamentals are strengthening, and its involvement in electrification, grid modernization, and AI-driven power demand renders the long-term narrative compelling.
If management can effectively implement its growth strategy—then valuations in the $900–1,000 range are mathematically feasible. However, with forward multiples already nearing 50× earnings and 90× EV/EBITDA, the margin for error is exceedingly slim.
For investors who trust in GE Vernova’s execution and the global power demand cycle, the stock still presents significant long-term potential. For others, it might be wise to wait for a pullback before re-entering.
Now, we apply a risk assessment framework while constructing the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which, consisting of 30 stocks, has a proven track record of consistently outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four-year period—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. . Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided better returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; providing a steadier ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics."

GE Aerospace (NYSE:GE) stock has seen a solid performance, rising by over 65% between 4/18/2025 and 10/15/2025. Several factors have driven the surge including a strong operational performance and upbeat outlook. A global rebound in air travel and production delays at Boeing and Airbus have lifted demand for GE’s engines and after-market services. Moreover, a $7 billion share buyback expansion and a dividend hike underscored management’s confidence in cash flows and long-term growth.
Quantitively, the move was mainly influenced by a 42.6% change in the company’s P/E Multiple. Although there is more to this narrative than just statistics, let’s first analyze the stock price fluctuations and their contributing factors.
Investing in a single stock can be risky, but there is immense value in a broader diversified approach that we adopt with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Additionally, think about what the long-term performance for your portfolio could be if you combined 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto with equities.
Returning to the “change”: The shifts in fundamental factors such as valuation, revenue, and margins come with a story regarding the underlying business and investor sentiment. Below, we have pinpointed key developments that impacted the stock price movement of GE stock. For context: GE delivers advanced industrial solutions worldwide across power, renewable energy, aviation, and healthcare, which encompasses medical imaging, digital healthcare, patient monitoring, diagnostics, and drug discovery technologies.
Here Is Why GE Aerospace Stock Moved
Our Current Assessment Of GE Stock
Opinion: At present, we consider GE stock unattractive. Why is that? Check out the full story. Read Buy or Sell GE Stock to understand the factors driving our current viewpoint.
Risk: Nonetheless, GE is not immune to significant impacts. It plummeted nearly 83% during the Global Financial Crisis and about 78% in the 2018 correction. The Dot-Com bubble erased close to 49%, and the Covid selloff resulted in a 58% drop. Even the recent inflation shock caused a decline of around 46%. Thus, regardless of how robust the setup appears, sharp market downturns can still severely affect this stock.
Selecting winning stocks consistently is a challenging endeavor – especially with the volatility linked to a single stock. Instead, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a collection of 30 stocks, has a proven history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four years. Why is that the case? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks offered superior returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; a smoother ride, as illustrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

I have CFLs that are 20 years old and going pretty strong.  I've had better luck with CFLs than I do with LED for longevity.  CFLs do have to warm up, but they are plenty bright and reasonably efficient.  The increased efficiency of LEDs is quickly offset by the cost of replacing them when they burn out so frequently.  LEDs can last nearly forever too, but not the way they are manufactured today with cheap components in the power supply and overdriving the LED crystals, sometimes by a factor of two.  Big Cl 
The thing is, Norway is wealthy exporting its plentiful oil.
I'd rather the profit goes into transforming their transportation system. It's not just Norway that has benefited, their pioneering the technology has helped push it forward and prove to other countries that it is not just feasible, it is highly desirable.
Oil that funds Middle Eastern states and their vanity projects, or Western oil companies who spew out FUD about climate change, they can sod off.
I don't know of any every-day EV drivers that ever want to go back to ICE. And the EV lifestyle is getting easier every day for many people. But not all North Americans.
First of all, a lot of people who have EVs still have an ICE so they never left.  The people who have only EVs have resigned themselves to being a person who mostly drives close to home.  That may be fine for them but the thought of losing the ability to just go for a long drive makes me sick.My Equinox EV has 500 km of range. I don't think my ability to ""just go for a long drive"" is in any sort of danger...

I assume you've never driven Chicago to D.C. (or similar) for business.  I've done it many times.  The longer your stops, the less sleep you get before the next day.  Air travel at least in the U.S. has gotten quite expensive, so driving those sorts of distances starts to make sense pretty quickly here.

Of course this isn't the end of it because there are still plenty of petrol / diesel cars on the road, and large vehicles like trucks but attrition will mean in 10 years 
Internal Combustion Engines ARE more expensive to own.
They are cheap to make and cheap to sell.   But maintenance and fuel costs are significantly higher.  Especially in Norway.
Norway is powered almost entirely (over 95%) by hydroelectric dams.   And they have little to no petroleum deposits. So electricity is far cheaper than gasoline/diesel.
As for maintenance, electric cars have far fewer moving parts.  Basically the wheels.  No movement = no wear and tear.  You know those non-car people that ask don't ch

No oil?  What are you talking about? Norway's economy has been powered by oil exports for years. They have so much they put the oil money in a big fund called Oljefondet (oil fund) which is now valued at $2 trillion!  They wisely use all this money to invest in hydro and other renewables, and to push the EV transition.  Very wise on their part.  But make no mistake, their wealth came from oil!
Biggest impediment in north America is price.  But then again all vehicles in North America are crazy expensive now and the used market is really bad.
But like I said, I don't know of anyone that daily drives an EV that would want to go back to ICE for daily commuting.

Then you have the MAGA brain-damaged, conspiratorial, & protectionist view of the world that EVs are evil, China is evil, WEF 15 minute cities etc so therefore let's all buy 15mpg pickup trucks.

Most of the very populated parts of Norway don't get too cold, but other parts definitely do!  In Alberta Canada, EV range drops to about 2/3 when it's very cold, and you really need to keep it plugged in overnight (or in a garage) to keep the battery warm. But 2/3 range is quite amazing actually, given cabin heating on top of batteries running colder.

I think as we see sodium ion batteries become more prevalent that they'll become very popular in colder climates because of their better performance in lower temperatures. As you say, most cars need heat pumps to warm up the battery for charging otherwise.
Most of the populated parts of Norway have winter lows that only just cross into sub-zero. The winter lows rarely drop below -5C which isn't cold by any measure. Nights where it gets -15C are incredibly rare, and days even more so. Norway is considered the most temperate country in its latitude. It's just not that cold and it's only just at the threshold where an EV would even bother taking any kind of action to maintain the battery. Even without any kind of special engineering EV range just isn't dramatica 
My parents lived in a sweden for a while not that long ago. In Stockholm, which is pretty warm, there are lots of EVs, and in fact teenagers can get licenses to drive very small, speed-limited cars, and many of those are now EVs.
Norway's wealth and size undoubtedly played a role in its EV success. The country has a population of 5.5 million and is one of the world's richest nations, thanks to substantial oil reserves — the largest in Europe after Russia. However, these factors alone don't fully explain the remarkable progress made. ...

Tax breaks and ease of movement helped
Favorable state policies have, undoubtedly, helped smooth the transition to electric vehicles. Norway levied no VAT (Value-added tax) or import duties on EVs, which can make up between a third and almost half of the cost of a new car.

EVs were also exempt from toll road charges and parking fees. They could even use bus lanes in and around the capital, Oslo.

Higher-income groups benefited the most from the tax breaks and the newly purchased EV was often a second family car.

Having almost reached the 2025 adoption goal, the government recently rolled back some of those incentives. VAT is now partially applied to large and luxury EVs, costing more than 500,000 kroner ($44,200, €42,500). Drivers from low-income groups still gain from many of the incentives and falling electric vehicle prices.

Bjorne Grimsrud, director of the Oslo-based transportation research center TOI, thinks the government incentives have been ""very costly"" but affordable, given the country's wealth and desire to be climate-neutral by 2050.

""The government used to collect 75 billion kroner annually from taxes and tolls on cars, but that has been cut in half,"" Grimsrud told DW.

Norway achieved (essentially) 100% EV sales by eliminating all VAT and Tariffs on new EVs up to 500,000 Kr, $50K US....
The majority of cars on the road in Norway are likely still ICE cars, bought before the EV incentives went into effect.
When a Norwegian buyer went into the showroom, there could have been up to a 50% price difference, with the EV being half the price of the similar ICE vehicles.
This is great and all, but few governments charge similar VAT and taxes on cars, and if they do, they likely lack 
I think that is right. But they also made EV's cheaper and more convenient to operate than an ICE vehicle. So EV's have an advantage even in the used car market. Which meant there was almost no reason for someone to choose the ICE vehicle. An EV was cheaper to buy. cheaper and more convenient to operate and held its value better. 
I don't think its impossible to create those conditions in other places. The problem is political and the power of the legacy industries. If the United States opened its doors to c 
...erm oil and gas don't kill it's just the way you use them.
But, this is good. If we have to burn stuff, better to do it in one place generating juice and manage it better,  rather than travelling all over the place and not managing it at all.  Aside from C02, think smog, asthma, copd and general grubbiness in polluted cities.
And respect to Norway for their sovereign wealth fund and welfare state. Hear the king is pretty cool too. Can I emigrate, is Norwegian hard to learn?
Norway polishes its enviromental halo in one hand while making an absolute killing by selling oil and gas to the rest of the world. Their sovereign wealth fund which is almost exclusively funded by fossil fuels is currently valued at 2 TRILLION dollars.
No one does enviromental hypocrisy like the Norwegians.
Gas cars lose comparable range in cold weather, so...?
https://www.energy.gov/energys... [energy.gov]
And when you mix in 'you can preheat your cabin while still connnected to your charger,' EVs lose *less* range than gas cars.
Norway isn't one of the top oil producing countries in the world  [wikipedia.org] and they're way behind the top producers in volume. They're known as an oil nation because of a small population relative to the amount of hydrocarbons they produce. More to the point, they never put a gun to anyone's head to force them to buy their oil (or perhaps, never sent a team of Viking berserkers to intimidate people into buying their oil). If people weren't buying their oil, they'd be buying from Saudis instead.
Oil is used for a lot m
Well done on completely missing the point. Its no different in principle to a group promoting healthy eating yet making its money selling burgers and doughnuts down the road.
If you believe in the enviroment leave the oil in the ground or make sure it only gets sold to companies for manufacturing purposes, not as fuel.
Well done on completely missing the point. Its no different in principle to a group promoting healthy eating yet making its money selling burgers and doughnuts down the road.There's some hypocrisy but I'm not sure what path you're suggesting here. Should Norway stop pumping gas/oil so that people go buy it from Saudi/Iran/Russia/USA/Venezuela instead?  They'd make no meaningful impact on global hydrocarbon usage, and leave their people worse off in the process.

Not sure whats so difficult to understand. Practice what you preach is a well known phrase, maybe you've heard of it. I'm not talking about overall oil consumption, I'm talking hypocrisy - google its meaning. You're probably the sort of person who'd see nothing wrong with a doctor telling someone to stop smoking for their health while sitting behind his desk puffing away.
So... your recommendation would be the ""make no meaningful impact on global hydrocarbon usage, and leave their people worse off in the process"" approach?
You're probably the sort of person who'd see nothing wrong with a doctor telling someone to stop smoking for their health while sitting behind his desk puffing away.The flaw in this analogy is that the doctor could stop smoking and improve their health in the exact same way that they're encouraging their patient to do.  The Norwegians can't stop pumping oil and have any meaningful positive environmental impact.  But regardless, I think professionally duty requires that even a chain-smoking doctor advise that their pati

I really don't know why you have a problem with the analogy, the meaning of the word hypocrisy or you're just playing devils advocate because you're bored. Either way, I think I'll just file you under ""idiot"" and leave it there.
If you believe in the enviroment leave the oil in the groundIf, starting from tomorrow, every single oil-producing country completely stopped selling any oil, civilization would collapse within, maybe, a few years. As it stands, trucks, shipping vessels, airplanes, concrete producing factories and many other essential things all run on hydrocarbons. For many developing nations almost all their power stations need oil or gas or coal. In order to combat climate change we need to come up with ways all these things can still function without needing oil anymore. Like, f

So let the developing nations pump the oil then. A nation with 2 trillion in the bank doesn't need to especially while pretending to be green by mandating EVs on the population.
Norway is sitting on a lot of oil, they only drill/produce less than they could.
Their wealth is from state ownership of the oil, and they use that wealth to help fund the govt, but let's not pretend Norway is some low-tax utopia, the citizens pay a healthy tax rate on most things (except, of course, EVs)
Yes we should do so. Every country made most of its money exploiting a usually dirty history and natural resource. The difference is Norway invested that money into a fund for its future while most other countries blow it on meaningless expenses that provide no benefit to its citizens.
Because all that oil was sold with an agreement not to burn it, right?If you're going to point out the indignities of the past as a reason to not support something in the future I remind you you once came screaming and crying bleeding out of a woman's vagina. But we won't hold that against you.

Population of Norway:  5.6 million.Population of USA:  340 millionNumber of cars in Norway:  2.9 millionNumber of cars in USA:  285 million.
What can or should be done in Norway has absolutely nothing to do with the US.
Norway is only 5.5 million people.  NY city alone is 8.5 million and Norway is the size of an average US state.  Who really cares what they do, they are pretty insignificant to the world in general.
Range Rover Velar has electronic flush door handles and a 5.0L V8. So I don't know if you hate EVs or hate being burned alive inside your car.Maybe that's just a one-off? Well there's the Cadillac CTS-V, with a 5.7L V8.
Tesla S is just one of many EVs. A few others go with those silly flush door handles and several others do not.

They did not ban the sale of gasoline cars, just incentivized EV sales. There will be a tax penalty on new gas/diesel sales in a few years but *not today*. I think you underestimate how expensive petrol is in the EU vs electricity. Norwegians aren't driving 200km a day in their car for the most part, its city driving, which is also the least efficient and therefore the most expensive.
  Fuck Tesla anyway, most of the cars being sold in Norway are Chinese models.
Shoes create a lot of rubber pollution too. When the tread wears off on your shoes where do you think it goes? And don't get me started on all the problems associated with bicycles.

Exactly this, eliminating pointless driving will reduce transport emissions more quickly and effectively than anything else.
X11 had built in remote support long before RDP, Telnet and serial terminals existed way before that too.
Almost all driving is pointless driving. You should be able to get everything you need on foot. After that there should be good public transit. Other than maybe for the disabled and emergency vehicles, cars should never be necessary.

Disabled wouldn't even get personal cars. That is just a symptom of our horribly designed towns and cities. It really is something when you see a disabled placard on someone's giant F-250. You just know they're an old selfish prick.
Almost all driving is pointless driving. You should be able to get everything you need on foot. After that there should be good public transit.A surprisingly large number of Americans aren't even willing to accept the range limitations of EVs as reasonable, and that basically boils down to having to make a stop for 30 minutes rather than 5.  The idea that we should be limited to the stores and restaurants within walking distance, and beholden to a train and/or bus schedule for everything else represents significantly more compromise than slightly longer pit stops.Honestly, my take on it has been if you enjoy urban living, fine, you do you.

Most of the urban noise comes from cars!  I had a nice place in a dead end street in a major East coast city and it was very quiet at night.  If we had more residential streets closed to through traffic or so-called ""superblocks"" it would be very peaceful in our cities most of the time.

I guess it's due to my always buying cars that were FUN to drive....performance oriented, good looking and well...FUN.

That's because your city is designed wrong.
Walkable cities have always been a thing. Only in America were cities designed around the car.
Exactly. I live in America and I'm in one of those underfunded, unsustainable suburb type cities in Florida (they are everywhere). It sucks having to drive everywhere. I even tried walking to the convenience store which is about a 15 minute walk from my house but it is *extremely* dangerous (America: safety last). The people are unhealthy and miserable. You can bet a lot of that is because everything is so spread out for no reason other than racism and car-centrism.
Only in America were cities designed around the car.That's not true. It's more pronounced in the US, yes, but not unique to it. There was a time in the 1960s and 70s where maybe not whole cities but new developments were designed around the car in other countries too. And even nowadays this happens way too often.

It's a continual struggle everywhere. Here, in Switzerland, the population recently voted to reject a number of extensions to the highway system, preferring to invest more in our excellent public transport system. The job of the politicians in parliament is to implement the referendum the public has voted on.

So what do the politicians do? They commission a study that examines the best places to invest transport money - funny, how it proposes extending the highway system at the expense of public transport. 
Not just America. Most British cities are pretty crap too.

What are the most expensive cities in the US when talking about accommodation? New York? Boston? Two of the few American cities where you can walk/don't need a car. Obviously even Americans prefer walkable cities. If you want space, get a summer house for that. The rest of the year you can live in something urban, really urban, now sprawl, and enjoy the day to day offering of culture, people, food, entertainment etc. I have never had a Netflix or Spotify (or similar) subscription because I go to the theatre

I agree. But my post was intentional hyperbole to question at what point we draw the line for discussing insignificant pollution versus the overwhelmingly larger portion. If I bring up fossil fuels versus electric cars, and someone wants to chime in a whataboutism and rant about tires, then I think we have a duty to push back on nonsense with more nonsense.

Storage problems are frustrating, but you donât need to upgrade your entire system to fix them. If your current setup is running out of room and you canât deal with slow speeds anymore, itâs time to grab a high-performance SSD.
There are quite a few in the market, and depending on the storage capacity youâre after, youâre looking at spending upwards of $80-$100 for a solid 1TB option from a reliable brand. That changes today, thanks to this current deal at Amazon, which is offering the Western Digital 1TB SSD for just $67, a 21% discount off its regular price. Youâre saving almost $20 on a reliable solution thatâs going to take all your storage headaches away for a while, but the offer wonât last too long. Grab it for less while you can!
See at Amazon
This tiny SSD gets you read speeds of up to 560MB/s, which makes for faster load times and smoother performance. Think quicker boot-ups and efficient file transfers throughout your day, without a hint of lag. The 1TB storage capacity is more than enough to store all your important files, both old and new. Whether you have a rich game library or like keeping all your favorite movies close, this SSD brings everything together in a single place. Itâs also great for offloading large projects and backups to create some extra room on your main drive.
Compatibility-wise, the Western Digital SSD uses a SATA III 6 Gb/s interface and fits into a standard 2.5-inch/7mm slot, so it should work with most laptops and desktops easily. Installation is pretty straightforward. Simply insert the drive, connect it to your system, and youâre good to go.

Is Google's latest AI image-editing tool an Adobe-killer? New data suggests it may be hurting it.
When Google launched its Gemini 2.5 Flash model — better known by its more fun codename Nano Banana — in August, it became a viral hit. Because of its ability to edit images using AI for free (or at a low cost if you're using it through the API), we wondered if it might spell bad news for Adobe, which sells competing image software.
Data provided to Business Insider by Appfigures, an analytics company, reveals that as downloads of Gemini skyrocketed around the time of Nano Banana's release, downloads of Firefly, Adobe's generative AI image and video app, began to slump.
While it's impossible to say for certain that the two are directly related, the timing closely matches. After launching in June, Firefly was experiencing ""impressive"" growth, with downloads in August up 150% over the previous month, Randy Nelson, Appfigures' head of insights, told Business Insider. Gemini grew just 20% in that same period. The data includes downloads from both the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
Adobe could not immediately be reached for comment. 
After Google rolled out Nano Banana to the Gemini app on August 26, Firefly downloads dropped by more than half over the following week, while Google's app skyrocketed.
As of October 6, Gemini downloads were up 331% compared to the last week of July, while Firefly was down 68% — its lowest since the arrival of Nano Banana — per the Appfigures data.
To further put that into perspective, Google's Gemini app had 6.1 million more downloads last week than the week it integrated the new image model, according to the data, while Firefly saw 2 million fewer downloads.
Further analysis from Appfigures of different territories shows that Gemini had an 88% jump in downloads in the US from the last month of September to the last month of October. Firefly, meanwhile, dropped by 82% during the same period in the US.
Adobe's Firefly app lets people use a variety of models, and in September it added Google's Nano Banana to the list. At the time of Nano Banana's launch, Adobe told Business Insider that its advantage lies in having a variety of different models in one place so that users don't have to move between different platforms.
Regardless, users appear to still be flocking to Gemini, and Adobe's stock price — down nearly 35% in the past year — reflects the challenges its business faces from Google, OpenAI, and a host of other AI competitors knocking on the door.

Over the previous ten years, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stock has delivered a remarkable $167 billion back to its investors through actual cash via dividends and stock buybacks. Let’s delve into some figures and see how this payout capability compares to the market’s leading capital-return entities.
 
Interestingly, META stock has provided the seventh-highest amount to shareholders in history.
Why is this important? Because dividends and stock buybacks represent direct and tangible returns of capital to shareholders. They also indicate management's confidence in the company's financial stability and its ability to produce sustainable cash flows. There are more stocks that exhibit similar traits. Below is a list of the top 10 companies ranked by total capital returned to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.
 
Investing in a single stock can be risky, yet there is significant value in a more diversified approach we adopt with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. We extend beyond just equities. Is a portfolio consisting of 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% cryptocurrency along with equities and bonds likely to yield higher returns during the next 1-3 years while offering better protection if markets decline by 20%? We have analyzed the data. 
Top 10 Stocks By Total Shareholder Return
Meta Platforms Fundamentals 
That’s a solid summary, yet assessing a stock from an investment standpoint involves much more. This is precisely what Trefis High Quality Portfolio aims to do. It has been created to minimize stock-specific risk while still providing exposure to potential gains.
 
META Historical Risk
However, META is not exempt from significant declines. It dropped approximately 43% during the 2018 market correction, 35% during the Covid pandemic, and faced a more severe loss of 77% during the inflation shock. Despite all the positives surrounding the stock, risks do persist. When markets falter, META can still experience substantial drop-offs.
Nonetheless, the risk extends beyond major market downturns. Stocks can decline even when conditions are favorable – consider situations like earnings announcements, business updates, and changes in outlook. Read META Dip Buyer Analyses to learn how the stock has rebounded from sharp declines in the past.
The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a selection of 30 stocks, consistently outperforms its benchmarks that encompass all three indices — the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000. Why is this the case? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; resulting in a less volatile experience, as evidenced by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Here is how Amazon.com (AMZN) stock compares to its competitors in terms of size, valuation, growth, and margins.
For context, Amazon.com engages in global retail sales of consumer goods and subscriptions, provides cloud services, and produces electronic devices such as Kindles, Fire tablets, Fire TVs, Rings, and Echo.
Recently, AMZN stock has seen significant declines, and we currently assess it as fairly priced. This might sound like a warning, and there’s notable risk in depending on a single stock. Nonetheless, there is substantial merit in a more broadly diversified strategy, as we do with the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Additionally, consider what the long-term performance of your portfolio could be if you included 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto alongside equities.
Why does this matter? AMZN has just decreased by -7.9% in a month, and peer comparisons put stock performance, valuation, and financials into perspective, highlighting whether it is genuinely outperforming, falling behind, and most importantly, could this trend persist? Read Buy or Sell AMZN Stock to find out if Amazon.com is indeed a falling knife. Sharp declines often present rebound opportunities – observe how the stock has dropped and recovered in the past through the AMZN Dip Buyer Analysis lens.
The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising a collection of 30 stocks, has demonstrated a record of consistently outperforming its benchmark, which includes all three indices – the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000. What is the reason for this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; they experience less volatility, as evidenced by the HQ Portfolio performance metrics."

My contrarian instincts often kick in when I see the crowd reaching a questionable consensus. Most of the time, what the crowd does IS the market; what they say, however, is often suspect.
Over the past few years, the crowd has expected rapid Federal Reserve rate cuts that never materialized; there were repeated expectations in 2022, ’23, and ‘24 of an imminent recession that never happened; the fears caused by market concentration seem to have also been ignored by Mr. Market.
Then there is the endless cacophony of bubble chatter.1  I cannot recall ever hearing the crowd identify a bubble in real time, and then there actually a) being a bubble that b) burst soon after.
By definition, it is the crowd that creates bubbles through a combination of psychology, greed/FOMO, excess liquidity, and sheer recklessness. It is rare to see that same crowd be able to identify that bubble in real time.
Way back in 2011, I tried to create a checklist of how to spot a bubble in real-time.2 It is 14 bullet quantitative points that should allow you to see if any market is exhibiting bubblicious tendencies.
Let’s go through those 14 points to see how they hold up today: (Spoiler: Lots of expensive stocks, and pricey bubbly tendencies, but we are not quite there yet):
Standard Deviations of Valuation: Markets are pricey, but not Japan 1989/1999-2000 Dotcom pricey
Significantly elevated returns: The past 15 years have seen returns of 16% annually. This is the third-best rolling 15-year period since WW2, but it also follows a 57% GFC crash. The past two years 25% annually. 2023-24 certainly counts as elevated.
Excess leverage: While there are some leveraged products put there like 2X and 3X ETFs, it is hardly a meaningful amount of capital (the same was said about Subprime, but that was wildly infiltrated throughout the entirety of the financial system)
New financial products: Alts? Private Credit? Neither is so much “New” as newly popular.
Expansion of Credit: Mostly tight, not very available.
Trading Volumes Spike: NYSE average daily trading volume (ADV) is roughly 1.36 billion shares – somewhat above historical average of 900 million to 1.2 billion shares per day. NASDAQ average daily volumes has exceeded 9 billion shares through 2025.​ ADV ranges 6–8 billion shares daily, so activity this year is well above average.
Perverse Incentives: I am not aware of much here other than the land grab in alts, the huge number of new ETFs, and the return of meme stock trading.
Tortured rationalizations: These are ever-present, but there has been some uptick lately.
Unintended Consequences: Have yet to fully happen.
Employment trends: Full employment is offset by eye-watering salaries for AI engineers.
Credit Spreads: Are very tight, and make me wonder why anyone would want to own HY when IG is almost the same pricing
Credit Standards: Still tight since the GFC.
Default Rates: Low, but moving higher in autos, credit card, mortgage but especially student loan debt.
Unusually Low Volatility: VIX atr 20 is not exactly complacent; as we saw in April, VOL has been quick to respond to any issue…
So while there are some signs of bubblicious activity, it is hardly overwhelming or seriously determinative in my view. Stocks are pricey, but this seems less like a bubble and more like a later-stage bull market cycle.
Earlier this year, I noted what a spectacularly underappreciated 15 years we have enjoyed. The bubble talk looks like a lot more of the same…
Remember, Greenspan’s “Irrational Exuberance” speech was December, 1996. All bull markets run further, longer, and higher than most expect…
 
Excerpt from original checklist after the jump…
 
Previously:
Checklist: How to Spot a Bubble in Real Time (June 9, 2011)
A Spectacularly Underappreciated 15 Years (April 28, 2025)
 
 
___________
Footnotes:
1. Old trader’s joke: “There is a bubble in calling bubbles…”
2. With the benefit of time and hindsight, it is easy to see the influence of the Great Financial Crisis on that list.
 

 
 
Realtime Bubble Checklist from June 9, 2011
1. Standard Deviations of Valuation: Look at traditional metrics –  valuations, P/E, price to sales, etc. — to rise two or even three standard deviations away from the historical mean.
2. Significantly elevated returns:  The S&P500 returns in the 1990s were far beyond what one could reasonably expect on a sustainable basis. The years around Greenspan’s “Irrational Exuberance” speech suggest that a bubble was forming:
1995    37.58
1996    22.96
1997    33.36
1998    28.58
1999    21.04
And the Nasdaq numbers were even better.
3. Excess leverage: Every great financial bubble has at its root easy money and rampant speculation. Find the leverage, and speculation won’t be too far behind.
4. New financial products: This is not a sufficient condition for bubble, but it does seems that each major bubble has new products somewhere in the mix. It may be Index funds, derivatives, tulips, 2/28 Arms.
5. Expansion of Credit:  This is beyond mere speculative leverage. With lots of money floating around, we eventually get around to funding the public to help inflate the bubble. From Credit cards to HELOCs, the 20th century was when the public was invited to leverage up.
6. Trading Volumes Spike: We saw it in equities, we saw it in derivatives, and we’ve seen it in houses: The transaction volumes in every major boom and bust, almost by definition, rises dramatically.
7. Perverse Incentives: Where you have unaligned incentives between corporate employees and shareholders, you get perverse results — like 300 mortgage companies blowing themselves up.
8. Tortured rationalizations: Look for absurd explanations for the new paradigm: Price to Clicks ratio, aggregating eyeballs, Dow 36,000.
9. Unintended Consequences: All legislation has unexpected and unwanted side effects. What recent (or not so recent) laws may have created an unexpected and bizarre result?
10. Employment trends:  A big increase in a given field — real estate brokers, day traders, etc. — may be a clue as to a developing bubble.
11. Credit Spreads: Look for a very low spread between legitimately AAA bonds and higher yielding junk can be indicative of fixed income risk appetites running too hot.
12. Credit Standards: Low and falling lending standards are always a forward indicator of credit trouble ahead. This can be part of a bubble psychology.
13. Default Rates: Very low default rates on corporate and high yield bonds can indicates the ease with which even poorly run companies can refinance. This suggests excess liquidity, and creates false sense of security.
14. Unusually Low Volatility: Low equity volatility readings over an extended period indicates equity investor complacency.

59,2025-10-16,"India's foreign ministry has said it is ""not aware"" of a phone call in which US President Donald Trump claimed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed to stop purchasing Russian oil. 
On Wednesday, Trump said his Indian counterpart had ""assured me today"" that it would end Russian oil imports, a move the US has pushed for in a bid to increase economic pressure on the Kremlin to end the war in Ukraine.
But asked about the call on Thursday, an Indian government spokesman cast doubt on Trump's account, saying he was ""not aware of any conversation between the two leaders"" taking place the previous day.
The Indian government had earlier said discussions were still ""ongoing"" with the US over its Russian oil purchases. 
It comes as a White House official confirmed to the BBC that Trump plans to speak to Russian President Vladimir Putin in a call on Thursday.
India has become a key energy customer for Russia since the outbreak of the war, partly allowing the Kremlin to withstand the impact of Ukrainian allies slashing oil and gas imports, the country's biggest export market. 
The Trump administration has put public and diplomatic pressure on India to end its support for the Russian energy market as it seeks to increase the Kremlin's economic isolation and force an end to the war. Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
Speaking at the White House on Wednesday, Trump said he had received assurances from Modi on Wednesday that India would halt its purchases ""within a short period of time"".
In its initial response, the Indian government did not directly dispute that the call between Trump and Modi had taken place. It read: ""Our consistent priority to safeguard the interests of the Indian consumer in a volatile energy scenario. Our import policies are guided entirely by this objective.""
The Indian government's second response on Thursday raises further questions over whether a deal has been struck between Washington and Delhi.
BBC News has contacted the White House and State Department for comment.
Delhi's continued reliance on Russian crude oil, which it imports at a discount, have become a key source of contention in US-India relations under the Trump administration, which has taken a tougher line on the Ukraine war after Putin failed to agree a peace deal with the White House.
India is second only to China for how much Russian energy it imports, funding which helps to prevent the collapse of Russia's critical fossil fuel industry. 
Modi's government has accused Ukraine's allies of hypocrisy, pointing to ongoing trade with Russia, including energy imports to the European Union, albeit at reduced levels.
In its latest round of sanctions unveiled this week, the UK government said it would target a major Indian oil refinery as it ""continue(s) to get facilitate getting Russian oil onto global markets"". Officials said India's Nayara Energy Limited imported 100 million barrels of Russian crude oil worth more than $5bn (£3.75bn) in 2024 alone.
At least 27 people have been killed in US strikes on alleged ""narco-boats"" in the Caribbean.
Bolton is the third of the US president's political opponents to face charges in recent weeks.
Previous presidential findings have seen the US arm rebels and conduct lethal strikes around the globe. 
Trump would not be drawn on whether the CIA was seeking to topple Maduro. 
The president has defended the fee and said the programme - used widely by US tech companies - was being abused

IonQ (NYSE:IONQ) stock is down 6.6% in a day in reaction to the company's announcement of a substantial $2 billion equity offering.
The news, released on Tuesday, October 14, detailed the sale of millions of new common shares and associated warrants. Investors reacted negatively because such a large issuance of new stock significantly dilutes the value of existing shares by increasing the total number of shares available on the market. 
While history suggests price dips recover, there is risk - specific to profitability and downturn resilience. Consider the following data:
It’s important to recognize that traditional financial numbers may not fully reflect IonQ's value, as it is a quantum computing company still largely in the research stage with commercial application years away. Instead, investors are primarily betting on the immense, long-term future potential of quantum technology when investing in IONQ stock.
While we like to buy dips if the fundamentals check out - for IONQ, see Buy or Sell IONQ Stock - we are wary of falling knives. Specifically, it is worth trying to answer if things get really bad, and IONQ drops another 20-30% to $51 levels, will we be able to hold on to the stock? What is the worst-case scenario? We call it downturn resilience. Turns out, the stock has fared much worse than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. We assess this based on both (a) how much the stock fell and (b) how quickly it recovered.
IONQ stock has fallen meaningfully recently, and we currently find it unattractive. This may feel like a caution, and there is a significant risk in relying on a single stock. However, there is a huge value to a broader diversified approach we take with the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Trefis works with Empirical Asset Management - a Boston area wealth manager - whose asset allocation strategies yielded positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P lost more than 40%. Empirical has incorporated the Trefis HQ Portfolio in this asset allocation framework to provide clients better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
Below are the details, but before that, as a quick background: IONQ provides general-purpose quantum computing systems accessible via major cloud platforms like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Marketplace.
Worried that IONQ could fall much more? You could take a look at the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics."

Navitas Semiconductor (NASDAQ:NVTS) stock has experienced an explosive rally, hitting its fifth consecutive day of gains and delivering a cumulative return of 96% over that period. This surge has added approximately $1.5 billion in value, bringing the company’s current market capitalization to about $3.2 billion. The stock is now trading 325% above its 2024 closing value, drastically outpacing the S&P 500’s year-to-date return of 13%.
This dramatic performance is directly attributable to an update on the company's partnership with Nvidia to develop power technology for next-generation AI data centers. The stock jumped significantly on October 14, 2025, after Navitas announced that its specialized gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) chips are actively supporting Nvidia's new 800V AI architecture.
Navitas focuses on the design, development, and sales of GaN power integrated circuits. After this rally, is NVTS still a buy - or is it time to lock in gains? Deep dive with Buy or Sell NVTS.
NVTS stock has jumped meaningfully recently, and we currently find it unattractive. This may feel like a caution, and there is a significant risk in relying on a single stock.

Empirical has incorporated the Trefis HQ Portfolio in this asset allocation framework to provide clients better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
The following table summarizes the return for NVTS stock vs. the S&P 500 index over different periods, including the current streak:
What is the point? Momentum often precedes conviction. A multi-day win streak can signal growing investor confidence or spark follow-on buying. Tracking such trends can help you ride the strength, or prepare for a well-timed entry if momentum fades. However, big gains can follow sharp reversals - but how has NVTS behaved after prior drops? See NVTS Dip Buyer Analysis to learn more.
There are currently 134 S&P constituents with 3 days or more of consecutive gains and 11 constituents with 3 days or more of consecutive losses.
While NVTS stock looks attractive given its winning streak, investing in a single stock without detailed, thorough analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors.

United Airlines (NASDAQ: UAL) is set to publish its earnings report on Thursday, October 16, 2025. For traders who focus on events, assessing historical stock behavior around earnings reports can be a useful tool, but the actual performance relative to consensus expectations will ultimately determine the stock's immediate reaction.
Reviewing the last five years, UAL stock has often shown negative single-day returns following earnings announcements. In 53% of cases, the stock has dropped, with a median negative return of -4.0% and a maximum one-day decline of -10.2%.
Traders can approach this event in two distinct manners:
Current consensus predictions suggest United Airlines will report earnings of $2.67 per share on revenue of $15.29 billion. This contrasts with the earnings of $3.33 per share and revenue of $14.84 billion from the same quarter last year.
From a fundamental viewpoint, United Airlines currently boasts a market capitalization of $33 billion. Over the past twelve months, the company generated $58 billion in revenue, alongside $5.4 billion in operating income and a net income of $3.3 billion, demonstrating operational profitability.
That said, if you're looking for an upside with reduced volatility compared to owning a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has significantly outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is this the case? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; it's less of a roller-coaster experience, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
See earnings reaction history of all stocks
Here are some insights into one-day (1D) post-earnings returns:
Additional information regarding observed 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns following earnings is summarized in the table below.
A comparatively lower-risk strategy (though it may not be effective if the correlation is weak) is to evaluate the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns following earnings, identify a pair with the highest correlation, and implement the suitable trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D demonstrate the highest correlation, a trader can take a ""long"" position for the next 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Below you will find correlation data based on a 5-year and a 3-year (more recent) history. Keep in mind that the correlation 1D_5D refers to the connection between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns.
At times, the performance of peers can affect the stock’s reaction post-earnings. In fact, the pricing may begin to adjust prior to the earnings being disclosed. Below is some historical data comparing the post-earnings performance of United Airlines stock with the stock performance of peers that reported earnings immediately before United Airlines. For a fair comparison, peer stock returns also reflect post-earnings one-day (1D) returns.
Investing in a single stock without thorough analysis can be hazardous. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has exceeded its all-cap stocks benchmark (the combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to deliver strong returns for investors. Why is this so? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a flexible way to capitalize on positive market conditions while reducing losses during downturns, as explained in RV Portfolio performance metrics."

I’m the kind of person who doesn’t really care about the brand of the bag that I’m carrying, as long as it is able to fit in all that I need for the entire day. I look more for the functional quality of the bag rather than what letters are involved. Uniqlo has been a go-to brand lately for me when it comes to shoulder bags, round mini bags, and messenger bags. This latest one that they’re releasing in collaboration with JW Anderson will definitely be added to my list.
Simply called the Canvas Tote Bag, it is exactly what its name advertises. It’s a carry-all bag that can become your EDC and also a secondary carry-on bag for when you’re traveling. The main purpose is for all your everyday stuff to fit in it without fuss as you go to school, work, or even for leisure. With a capacity of 21 liters and dimensions of 21.7 x 16.5 x 13.2 inches, it should be able to handle a laptop, books, a water bottle, and all sorts of pouches that you carry around.
Designer Collaboration: Uniqlo x JW Anderson






What makes this tote particularly appealing is its versatility across different life scenarios. For students, it’s spacious enough to carry textbooks, notebooks, and tech essentials without looking bulky or academic. Working professionals will appreciate how it transitions seamlessly from commute companion to office accessory, holding everything from lunch containers to important documents. The structured yet soft silhouette means it won’t look out of place whether you’re heading to a coffee meeting or weekend farmers market.







Uniqlo has a knack for collaborating with great designers and creating clothes and accessories that are relatively affordable and accessible. It has become one of the most well-known casual wear brands and retailers in recent decades. Every time they drop a collab with designers like JW Anderson, KAWS, Anya Hindmarch, Maiko Kurogouchi, Marni, etc., the items become must-haves and oftentimes, they’re out of stock early on.


JW Anderson brings a particular design sensibility to this collaboration that elevates the humble tote bag. Known for his avant-garde approach to everyday items, Anderson has a gift for making functional pieces feel special without being pretentious. His influence is subtle here. You won’t find dramatic architectural elements or bold graphics, but rather thoughtful proportions and that perfect balance between structured and slouchy that makes a bag photograph beautifully and carry comfortably.


This Canvas Tote Bag has the hallmarks of another classic bag for the brand. The durable, heavyweight canvas material will ensure that it can last for years, even if you use it every day and stuff all your things in it. The canvas weight strikes that sweet spot. It is substantial enough to maintain its shape when loaded, but not so heavy that it adds unnecessary bulk to your daily carry. The design is pretty simple, minimalist, and vintage so it can match all kinds of outfits and aesthetics. It also has an inner pocket with a slide fastener if you need to store some small, important things in there without mixing them with all your other stuff.

Since this is a collaboration with JW Anderson, you get vibrant colorways to accent your outfit of the day. You get bright blue, dark blue, and bright red, but probably most purists will go for the natural canvas for a classic-looking tote bag. The color selection feels intentional. The blues offer versatility for both casual and professional settings, while the bright red provides that pop of personality for those who like their accessories to make a statement. There’s just a tiny JWA logo on the bottom of the bag, which doesn’t take away from the minimalist look of the entire canvas bag.




The Canvas Tote Bag will be available sometime in mid-October and is priced at just $40. At this price point, it’s positioned perfectly for gift-giving season as it is affordable enough to buy multiples and special enough to feel considered. It would be a perfect holiday gift for your friends or yourself. Well, that is, if stock will actually last until then. I, for one, am looking forward to collecting all four colors since I’ll leave my house four times a week and use one color for each day.

Nvidia's financial performance has been extraordinary, making it the most valuable U.S. company at a $4.4 trillion market cap.Its market dominance stems can be attributed to the company's leadership, it's high-powered chips and a comprehensive, full-stack AI infrastructure strategy.Despite its stock run-up, valuation metrics indicate Nvidia may still be undervalued given its strong growth potential.
A $1,000 investment in Nvidia (NVDA) five years ago would be worth more than $12,000 today. The chipmaker’s stock has enjoyed a remarkable run, fueled by surging demand for its high-powered GPUs amid the AI boom.  
This wasn’t a hype-driven rally. The stock never got ahead of its fundamentals; if anything, investors were late to recognize what Nvidia had been quietly building for years. When AI’s moment arrived, Nvidia was ready to embrace it.
Over the last five years, Nvidia executed two stock splits:
On Oct. 14, 2020, Nvidia closed at $14.05 on a split-adjusted basis. That means a $1,000 investment would have bought 71 shares.
As of Oct. 14, 2025, Nvidia closed at $180.03 per share, making those 71 shares worth $12,782.13—a more than 12x return, and that’s excluding any dividends received along the way.
For comparison, a $1,000 investment in the SPY ETF, which tracks the S&P 500 index, would have grown to $1,986.69 in the same period.
The takeaway? Whether you held or missed out, Nvidia’s return has been extraordinary.
What drove this exponential return?
Nvidia’s strategic pivot — repurposing its powerful graphics chips for AI workloads — proved transformational as AI became a dominant investment theme after OpenAI released ChatGPT in late 2022. Though AI had been evolving for decades, ChatGPT made it tangible, accessible and personal for the mainstream.. Nvidia positioned itself at the center of the AI narrative, capturing demand from cloud providers, data centers and enterprises racing to build next-generation infrastructure.
In May 2020, Nvidia launched the A100, the first GPU based on its Ampere architecture. Delivering up to 20x performance improvements over the previous generation Nvidia GPU, A100 quickly became the gold standard for AI. Major customers included Alibaba Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Baidu Cloud, Cisco, Dell Technologies, Google Cloud, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle.  After the launch, NVDA shares rose from $8 in mid May to end the year at $13.02, representing a gain of 63%
Nvidia stock ended 2021 at $29.36, gaining 125% from the previous year’s close, as the Covid-ridden world embraced high-performance computing for remote work, gaming and data analytics. Demand from crypto mining also contributed to stock gains.  In April 2021, Nvidia announced the general availability of  Omniverse Enterprise, a 3D simulation platform for creating digital twins and virtual worlds. A key attribute of the Omniverse is to create physically accurate visualizations and simulations of products and environments, reducing the time and costs of physical testing.
Nvidia announced its first Hopper-architecture-based GPU, the NVIDIA H100, in 2022, calling it “the engine of the world’s AI infrastructure.” The H100 was designed to be deployed in every type of data center, including on-premises, cloud, hybrid-cloud and edge. While investor response to the H100 announcement was initially muted, the GPU would  prove to be a critical enabler of large-scale AI workloads in the following years.
ChatGPT’s release on Nov 30, 2022, marked an inflection point for AI. Nvidia stock jumped 8% that day — an early sign that the market was beginning to recognize Nvidia’s potential.  However, by the end of the year, the Nvidia stock retraced to 2020 levels, wiping out its 2021 gains. A major reason was the crypto market crash, which significantly reduced demand for Nvidia’s gaming GPUs used by miners. The same year, Nvidia faced yet another setback when  the U.S. government introduced controls to prevent the chipmaker from exporting its most powerful chips, including the A100 and H100 GPUs  to China, threatening a solid revenue stream. 
The explosion of investment in generative AI in 2023 led to a surge in demand for AI infrastructure. With its H100 GPUs already in production, Nvidia became a clear beneficiary.. Both institutional and retail investors piled into the AI theme and Nvidia’s stock more than tripled over the year, closing 2023 near $50. Nvidia also crossed $1 trillion in market capitalization for the first time.
The momentum carried into 2024. As major tech companies allocated billions of dollars to expand their AI capabilities, Nvidia's datacenter revenues soared. At its annual GTC conference in March 2024, Nvidia unveiled its next-generation Blackwell GPU platform, reinforcing optimism about its roadmap. In June 2024, Nvidia executed a 10-for-1 stock split to increase accessibility for investors. Later that year, Nvidia was added to the prestigious Dow Jones Industrial Average – a recognition of its market leadership.
Nvidia’s financial performance has been equally impressive. The AI bellwether more than doubled its revenues for fiscal 2024 and then doubled its revenues again in fiscal 2025 in rapid succession. Positive investor sentiment drove record inflows into the stock, making Nvidia the most valuable company in the U.S. with a $4.4 trillion market cap. Recently, CEO Jensen Huang confirmed that the exponential demand for AI computing, particularly for the newer Blackwell GPUs, showed no signs of slowing down. 
With Nvidia stock setting new highs, some analysts are even forecasting a potential future valuation of $7 trillion, despite setbacks with China and intensifying competition from AMD. 
Nvidia’s decision to repurpose its graphics chips for AI was nothing short of visionary. Recognizing that the parallel processing architecture originally designed for rendering complex graphics was also perfectly suited for the intense computational demands of AI – marked a pivotal turning point and redefined the company’s future.
The introduction of the Compute Unified Device Architecture in 2006 is Nvidia’s most significant differentiator. CUDA provided software tools that allowed developers to program Nvidia GPUs for general computing tasks beyond graphics. Thus Nvidia built a robust software ecosystem around its hardware. This early move created a durable competitive moat, fostering developer loyalty and driving long-term platform adoption. It meant that researchers and developers building AI models were already accustomed to Nvidia's software and hardware long before the AI boom truly kicked off, positioning Nvidia as the default choice for AI infrastructure.
Unlike its competition, Nvidia focuses on building the entire AI infrastructure. Its end-to-end AI platform encompassing GPUs, CPUs, networking hardware, and full-stack software gives it the capability to build AI supercomputers, while enabling customers to deploy AI with greater ROI. 
Nvidia’s ability to deliver new GPU architectures with significant performance gains — such as Ampere, Hopper and Blackwell — has kept it consistently ahead of the curve. The company’s rapid iteration has made it the go-to provider for customers racing to keep pace with the computing demands of generative AI and large language models.
Nvidia’s financials have been growing at a faster pace in recent fiscal years, leading to the sharp rise in its share price. Revenues have grown from $26.97 billion in fiscal 2023 to $60.92 billion in fiscal 2024 and to $130.5 billion in fiscal 2025. The growth in revenue has been accompanied by strong profitability. Operating income has grown from $4.2 billion in fiscal 2023 to $32.9 billion in fiscal 2024 to $81.5 billion in fiscal 2025 and  earnings per share from $0.17 in fiscal 2023 to $1.19 in fiscal 2024 and to $2.94 in fiscal 2025. 
Nvidia has shown remarkable resilience, enduring the 2022 crypto crash that severely impacted its gaming segment and the current US-China trade tensions. China has been a key market for Nvidia; it represented $17 billion or 13% of Nvidia’s sales for the fiscal year that ended in January. But Nvidia’s market share in the region has weakened from 95% before 2022  to just 50% after U.S. regulators tightened restrictions on selling high-end AI chips to China over national security concerns. Instead of resisting policy constraints, Nvidia adjusted swiftly by introducing the H20, a watered-down version of its H100 GPU designed for U.S. compliance — demonstrating its agility in navigating complex regulations. With China turning away from its chips now, Nvidia is accelerating expansion into new markets, again highlighting its resourcefulness.
Huang’s leadership remains Nvidia’s greatest asset. The visionary chief executive touted the transformational potential of AI long before it went mainstream and prepared Nvidia to be at the heart of the AI buildout boom. As a founder-CEO, he brings continuity, long-term strategic vision and assertiveness to steer Nvidia through a complex technological and geopolitical situation. 
Huang’s pragmatic leadership has been on display repeatedly: He lobbied effectively to ease U.S. restrictions on H20 chip exports, yet accepted China’s subsequent rejection of Nvidia’s H20 and RTX Pro 6000D chips with composure. Chinese regulators have reportedly directed companies like Alibaba and ByteDance to cancel orders for Nvidia’s RTX Pro 6000D processors, which are specifically designed to comply with U.S. export rules and serve the Chinese market.  Instead of dwelling on the setback, Nvidia shifted strategy — assuming a “China zero” baseline in financial guidance and treating any China-related sales as potential upside rather than expectation.
The recent U.S. approval to sell AI chips to the UAE drove Nvidia stock to new highs, and a deal to sell directly to OpenAI, bypassing traditional cloud partners — reflects the company’s evolving sales strategy. Meanwhile, Nvidia’s strategic investment in Intel points to initiatives to diversify manufacturing sources beyond TSMC, as Taiwan faces an ongoing geopolitical threat of invasion from China. This proactive de-risking underscores Huang’s forward-looking approach that continues to set Nvidia apart.
Nvidia still has a long growth runway extending into the next decade. Last month, Nvidia unveiled Rubin CPX, a new class of GPU designed to handle million-token coding and generative video applications. Rubin CPX is offered in multiple configurations, including the Vera Rubin NVL144 CPX , which Nvidia says will enable companies to generate $5 billion in token revenue for every $100 million invested. Rubin is on schedule for volume production next year.
Over the next five years, Nvidia expects to scale into a $3-4 trillion AI infrastructure opportunity with its Blackwell, Rubin and other successors. The AI infrastructure market continues to expand significantly with $600 billion in data center and computing-power investments expected this year. The key drivers for these investments include reasoning agentic AI that would require a lot of computing power, global build outs for sovereign AI, enterprise AI adoption, and the arrival of robotics and physical AI.
Blackwell has set industry benchmarks for AI inference ROI. As agentic and reasoning-based models gain traction, inference workloads are scaling across sectors, positioning Blackwell as a core growth engine. Nvidia claims that its Blackwell platform delivers the highest ROI at AI factory scale and can generate $75 million in token revenue over three years from a $5 million investment. Token revenue is earned during an AI system’s inference phase, where it processes input tokens and generates output tokens to produce responses. The faster and more efficiently it handles each token, the greater the potential revenue the system can generate.
Nvidia’s RTX Pro servers enable enterprises to build AI factories and accelerate enterprise workloads from agentic AI and LLM inference to industrial AI and digital twins. About 90 companies have already adopted  RTX Pro servers, including Hitachi, which uses these for real-time simulation and digital twins,  Lilly for drug discovery, Hyundai for factory design and AV validation and Disney for immersive storytelling. RTX Pro servers are expected to become a multibillion-dollar product line as enterprises modernize data centers. 
Sovereign AI has emerged as a growth pillar, as nations seek to build in-country AI infrastructure using Nvidia’s full-stack. Nvidia is working on Sovereign AI  initiatives across The UK and Europe.
The European Union plans to invest €20 billion to establish 20 AI factories in France, Germany, Italy and Spain, including five gigafactories to increase its AI infrastructure tenfold.
Isambard-AI, deemed as the UK’s most powerful AI supercomputer, is powered by Nvidia. This supercomputer aims to accelerate breakthroughs in fields of drug discovery and climate modeling.
Nvidia expects to achieve over $20 billion in sovereign AI revenue this year, more than twice its revenue last year. 
Networking, which is shaping up as a critical contributor for Nvidia, fetched second quarter revenues of $7.3 billion, up 98% year-on-year and up 46% sequentially. Strong demand across Spectrum X Ethernet, InfiniBand, and NVLink spurred the strong growth. Spectrum X, which is the  world’s first Ethernet networking platform for AI, is now annualizing over $10 billion in revenue, accelerating from an $8 billion annual run rate in the first quarter. 
THOR, Nvidia’s new robotics computing platform is seeing early adoption from leading players like Meta, Amazon Robotics, Agility Robotics, Boston Dynamics, Caterpillar, Figure, Hexagon and Medtronic. Robotic applications require exponentially more computing power and infrastructure, representing a significant long-term demand driver for Nvidia’s data center platform. 
Last but not the least, Nvidia’s near-term outlook looks upbeat. It sees third-quarter revenues of $54 billion, plus or minus 2% – implying a range of $52.9 billion to $55.1 billion compared to the consensus of $53.1 billion. This is higher than the $46.7 billion in revenues it generated for the second quarter. The outlook assumes no H20 shipments to China. 
So, does Nvidia look like it’s slowing down?
Even at record highs, Nvidia’s stock may not be as overvalued as it appears. Several valuation metrics suggest there’s still room for upside:
These metrics suggest that, despite its impressive run-up, Nvidia stock may still be undervalued relative to its historical and sector benchmarks.
Nvidia stock isn’t trading on hype The market is pricing in its AI leadership and perhaps even under-pricing the scale of its opportunity. Despite a hefty $4.4 trillion market cap, Nvidia remains deeply embedded in the multitrillion-dollar AI infrastructure cycle that continues to unfold. Nvidia isn’t some accessory to AI buildout, it is the backbone of the process.
The company’s financial results continue to validate this growth narrative, with sustained momentum across key segments. Competition from AMD cannot be brushed off, but Nvidia’s full-stack advantage remains difficult to replicate. 
China is a near-term setback, but Nvidia is already expanding into other international markets. Nvidia’s dominance in data centers, sovereign AI initiatives and enterprise AI point to a multi-year growth runway. The recent dip in Nvidia stock presents a buying opportunity, in my opinion.
Despite a nearly 1,200% surge over the past five years, Nvidia’s growth shows no signs of fatigue. No stock, including Nvidia, has a straight upward trajectory and periods of volatility are inevitable. However, pullbacks in Nvidia stock could offer attractive entry points for investors with a long-term view. As the buildout of AI infrastructure continues to accelerate, Nvidia stock appears well-positioned to set new highs.
How much would $1,000 invested in NVDA five years ago be worth now?
A $1,000 investment in Nvidia shares five years ago would now be worth more than $12,000, excluding dividends.
What was the main driver of Nvidia's stock price growth? 
Nvidia’s early and strategic positioning at the center of the AI boom — serving cloud providers, data centers, and enterprises racing to build next-generation infrastructure — fueled its extraordinary gains.
Is Nvidia still a good investment today? 
As the buildout of AI infrastructure continues to accelerate, Nvidia stock appears well-positioned to set new highs, thanks to its dominant market share, cutting-edge technology and expanding end markets.

Asian equities had a strong day before TSMC’s post-close financial results, as US-China tensions eased on Treasury Secretary Bessent’s truce comments, and the US dollar resumed its decline. Having pulled off the Israel-Gaza peace agreement, I suspect the US’s increased pressure on China is to help President Trump resolve the Ukraine war. Makes sense, right?
It was a quiet night in Hong Kong and China with light volumes as traders wait for further clarity on the US-China geopolitical situation. Hong Kong and especially Hong Kong growth/tech/internet names have worked off their overbought situation as their Relative Strength Index (RSI) declines, and their 50-day moving averages have been acting as support. Alibaba -0.25% as its Singles Day (November 11th) pre-sales kicked off last night. In the first hour, 35 brands had RMB 100 million in sales, 1,802 orders were received, and active users exceeded last year’s. Cosmetics and sports apparel were in vogue with Estee Lauder, Nike, and Anta reportedly seeing strong demand out of the gate. Cosmetics company Giant Biogene (2367 HK) fell -15.21% on concerns its products weren’t doing well during Singles Day, though the company’s controlling shareholder bought 760,000 shares on the dip.
Nio -8.99% after a well-respected Singapore sovereign wealth fund, GIC’s August lawsuit in a NYC court for inflating revenue was discovered. GIC is accusing Nio of recognizing revenues sold to its battery swap affiliate, though the batteries hadn’t yet been sold to end clients. The news weighed on EV and battery space, including Xiaomi -3.6%, CATL -1.2% and Xpeng -3.5% despite CEO He Xiaopeng announcing flying car production will begin in 2026.
He also announced at the 2025 Sustainable Global Leaders Conference in Shanghai that their humanoid robot launch last month will be enhanced by a new AI visual and language system. The NDRC announced a three-year plan to increase EV charging stations, which likely explains the outperformance of clean tech companies such as Sungrow +7.66%, Longi +2.61%, the Hong Kong and Mainland electricity and coal sub-sectors. If power generation is the key to AI, doesn’t China have a huge advantage due to its massive solar (12% of electrical output), wind (13%), nuclear (5%), and hydro (16%)? Surprised this hasn’t hit investors’ radar yet.
Coincidentally, a Mainland media source noted “the world’s first onshore commercial modular small reactor…has passed the safety review of the International Atomic Energy Agency”. Mainland investors bought a healthy $2.035B of Hong Kong stocks today, accounting for 25% of Hong Kong volumes via Southbound Stock Connect. Zijin Gold International +3.8% after being added to the Southbound Stock Connect. Interesting that Mainland precious metals and mining stocks had another down day. The Mainland precious metals sub-sector has doubled since January 2024. Maybe a signal for the red-hot global gold and mining space? Mainland China had a significant value bias as banks, insurance, and utilities outperformed while growth stocks such as semis and the STAR Board underperformed. The National Team’s favored ETFs had average/slightly above average volumes. Maybe buy the dip from the National Team a little? Hard to know for sure though………
The China Federation of Logistics & Purchasing released the E-commerce Logistics Index, which increased MoM to a new high. I’ll have to dig into this further and report back.

Toyota will attempt to reshape the global luxury car market by transforming Century from a revered Japanese car into a standalone brand positioned above Lexus, with ambitions to rival Rolls-Royce and Bentley on the world stage. Carscoops reports Toyota announced the decision during a panel discussion ahead of the Japan Mobility Show, which opens to the public on October 31 in Tokyo.
Chairman Akio Toyoda explained the rationale behind the move, saying “when we go higher-end, we need something above, not Lexus, nor Toyota.”
“And we have the Century,” he said. “That is the position of the Century.”​
First introduced in 1967 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Toyota founder Sakichi Toyoda’s birth, the Century has been the automaker’s flagship car for nearly six decades. But the model was traditionally reserved for Japan’s political elite, business leaders, and members of the Imperial House of Japan, blending low-key luxury with Toyota’s reputation for meticulous craftsmanship. Unlike typical luxury vehicles that signal wealth, Century is often marketed as a symbol of achievement through “persistent work, the kind that is done in a plain but formal suit,” as one old Toyota brochure put it.​
Toyota’s decision to elevate Century from a luxury car to a new brand altogether comes as the company seeks to clarify its luxury hierarchy and give Lexus greater creative freedom. Simon Humphreys, Toyota’s chief branding officer, told Carscoops the separation will allow Lexus to operate with more autonomy. “In a sense, Lexus will be freer to act,” Humphreys explained. “Lexus should continue to take on challenges as a pioneer. Century will take on the high-end market as the top of the top, one of one.”​
Century’s new brand identity will be showcased through the One of One concept, a coupe that looks like if a Rolls Royce had a baby with an SUV. While the driver’s side door opens normally, the front passenger seat has sliding doors that open forward and backward, offering a wide opening—and since the passenger seat is actually situated a bit further back in the car, you get exceptional legroom if you’re riding shotgun. And unlike traditional luxury coupes, the One of One has no rear window and rides high on large wheels, giving it a muscular, but still modern appearance.
Currently, there are two cars sold in Japan that offer the Century branding: a sedan with a 5.0-liter V8 hybrid system, and an SUV powered by a 3.5-liter V6 plug-in hybrid. The sedan, which underwent its most recent redesign in 2018, starts at approximately $180,000, while the SUV begins around $170,000. Toyota produces just 50 sedan units each month and 30 SUV units, maintaining exclusivity through limited production.​
The brand will expand globally, but slowly and cautiously. Century SUVs launched in China last October, with approximately 40 units sold through Lexus dealerships. The UAE is expected to receive its first shipments in 2026, also through the Lexus network. Toyota has not announced plans to bring Century to the United States, though the brand is “studying” international opportunities.​ Generally though, Forbes reports each Lexus dealership offering Century will employ a “Century Meister,” a dedicated specialist trained to provide personalized presentations and service.​
Toyota’s new brand structure can be compared to Japanese watchmaking, where Seiko, Grand Seiko, and Credor serve different market segments under the same parent company. Whether Century can compete with European ultra-luxury cars remains to be seen, but Toyota is betting its heritage of Japanese craftsmanship and reliability will resonate with buyers.​
You can get a sneak peek of Toyota’s One of One concept for the new Century brand below:

72,2025-10-16,"This battle royale skydiving tag game has a playable demo right now, playable across VR and non-VR systems.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Enjoy our content? Make sure to set Android Central as a preferred source in Google Search, and find out why you should so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.
 



In his weekly column, Android Central Senior Content Producer Nick Sutrich delves into all things VR, from new hardware to new games, upcoming technologies, and so much more.
Imagine yourself in a plane surrounded by seven other people. Everyone is suited up to jump out, and just as the bay doors open, a brown backpack is thrown out that looks a lot like a parachute. Unfortunately, you don't have time to wonder if the thing on your back is a real parachute or a fake, because the plane has already ejected everyone, and you're now free-falling at 10,000ft in the air.
Knowing what's likely going to happen, it's pretty clear to you that you're not going to be the one landing without a parachute. For the next several minutes, all eight of you battle it out in the clouds, using your arm-mounted rockets and grappling hooks to catch other players and keep the backpack until the end.
The game is Project Freefall, and its unique nature isn't just the gameplay; it's also the fact that you can play on a Meta Quest headset, a Steam Deck, or any of the other non-VR platforms the game supports, all flying together in a fairly rare cross-platform quest to reach the bottom.
Developer Schell Games has long made some of the best Meta Quest games. The veteran VR studio is behind well-known games like I Expect You to Die, Among Us VR, Silent Slayer: Vault of the Vampire, Until You Fall, and many more. While Among Us VR eventually became Among Us 3D with crossplay support between VR and non-VR systems, Project Freefall is designed for crossplay from day one.
The game launched in ""earliest access"" this week during Steam Next Fest, with a demo on the Meta Quest and a demo on Steam that you can download right now. Since the game is multiplayer only, I recommend visiting Schell Games' Discord server and joining any one of the active sessions posted there.
Project Freefall is simple enough in concept, but certainly one of those games that'll become increasingly complex as players master the unique movement systems. As you're falling through the air, you not only have those arm-mounted thrusters, but each hand has an independent grappling hook that can be used to grab items or pull yourself toward obstacles.

Why are there giant Ninja Warrior-esque obstacles falling through the air while you skydive? It's a video game that's not afraid to be a video game, that's why! Any number of objects can fall, from giant shark statues to literal Ninja Warrior-style obstacle courses that you can pull yourself through to avoid being tagged.

Grabbing the backpack is as easy as simply running into the player wearing it, from whence you'll immediately boost away wearing the coveted prize. Schell Games told me this small boost was introduced in early testing to help avoid the pitfalls of backpack juggling, giving players a brief moment to collect themselves before being chased.
Along with those giant obstacles that help make movement more complex in an otherwise empty sky, you'll find a smattering of power-ups and items that help you achieve the goal of holding the backpack the longest.

Whether it's a paint grenade to blind your opponents, Mario Kart style, or a bat that you can smack them with and stun them, these items are all about increasing the competitive nature of the game.
And that brings me to the unique qualities of playing on each supported platform. VR players will find that they have a distinct movement advantage, as they can easily aim each of their arms in different directions or even blind fire toward an obstacle while faking movement toward another. It's a classic juke movement that's made even more chaotic by the freedom of movement VR allows.
But non-VRs aren't at a disadvantage, despite being a little stiffer. While the VR version plays out in first person, the non-VR version is entirely done in 3rd-person. This gives the non-VR version a distinct perspective advantage, as you can more easily see everything around you without having to whip your head around constantly.
 



Schell Games told me it worked around the clock to balance these two distinct gaming perspectives, ensuring that neither platform has an overwhelming advantage. Some players will simply choose one over the other based on either convenience or their own strengths. If anything, playing it on a Steam Deck made it feel more chill, while the VR version felt far more active and chaotic, effectively highlighting the strengths of both systems.
The full early access period begins on October 21 and is fully free to play. A fairly standard skin shop is set up for players to purchase unique skins if they want, although in-game currency ensures that you will be able to earn skins and plenty of other fun cosmetic prizes without having to bankroll your character.
Check out the demo now and give it a shot! I was thoroughly impressed with how much fun it was, and the unique movement concepts make it feel substantially different in a flooded market of games that too often feel the same.
 




Whether you love social environments, puzzle game, multiplayer shooters, or just checking out the next evolution of technology, the Meta Quest 3s has it all at a lower price than you imagined.

74,2025-10-16,"Earlier we looked at the sharply-designed OMO X, a scooter by Chinese manufacturer Omoway.
 
Seeing the OMO X we wondered if Honda, the global leader in scooters, would notice and counter with a designey Chinese-market scooter of their own. We now have the answer: Not exactly. In China, Honda has partnered up with Sundiro, another Chinese brand, to produce scooters together. The idea is to combine Honda engineering with Sundiro's distinctly-Chinese-market flavor. The 50-50 venture has yielded this Sundiro Honda Square X125, which almost looks like it was designed in Minecraft:
 
The 125cc scooter is designed to have a techie appeal, with squares and boxes unexpectedly interrupting the form.


 
 
 
Behind the seatback is a rack for strapping things to, and the surface is festooned with cutouts; the companies plan to release storage accessories that can be slotted in.
 
 
The seatback can also be folded down, serving as passenger seating.
 
On the side is a little flip-up table, for…tea breaks?
 
 
The utilitarian design also includes two USB ports.
 
If you're wondering where the gas cap is, it's down in the center.
 
While the tank only holds 1.5 gallons (you read that right), the scooter gets an absurd 138 mpg. That's enough for a city dweller to get out into the country, as the marketing materials suggest.


Released just this month in China, the scooter retails for 12,680 yuan, which is under USD $1,800. However, fat chance we'll see one of these in the 'States.

Luxury fashion saw an investor resurgence on Wednesday, as French conglomerate LVMH reported an increase in quarterly sales growth for the first time this year.
The CAC 40, a French stock market index featuring Hermès, Kering and LVMH, among others, closed up nearly 2% on Wednesday. LVMH’s rise also added to chairman Bernard Arnault’s fortune by more than $18 billion.
The performance of LVMH, which includes brands like Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Sephora, will “likely set a positive tone for the upcoming luxury reporting season,” analysts said. A positive turnaround for sales in China drove the gains, Reuters reported.
Despite ongoing trade tensions, the Chinese government said Apple would boost investment in the country, though it did not provide details on the size of the investment. The company’s CEO Tim Cook made a trip to China this week, even as President Donald Trump has threatened 100% tariffs on the country after it enacted export controls over rare earths.
A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump Administration from laying off workers during the government shutdown, meaning those employees will have their jobs secured for at least two more weeks. Federal workers’ unions had argued the layoffs were being used as an unlawful pressure tactic against Democrats, and the judge said Wednesday that the government is using the shutdown to “assume all bets are off, the laws don’t apply to them anymore.”
As the One Big Beautiful Bill Act limits student loans for parents and graduate students, the nation’s Historically Black Colleges and Universities, whose students rely more heavily on federal loans, are bracing for impact. But some billionaires are stepping in and supporting the institutions—including Atlanta Falcons owner and Home Depot cofounder Arthur Blank, who this week committed $50 million in scholarships for students at four Atlanta HBCUs.
Andy Slavitt left his government job and set out to use technology to improve healthcare for underserved and low-income communities in 2018 through healthcare-focused VC firm Town Hall Ventures. Since then, the firm has invested in 35 companies and started seven others. Now, Town Hall Ventures told Forbes it has raised $440 million for a fourth fund, bringing its total assets under management to $1.4 billion.
A Colorado couple raked in millions in sales for a device that claims to help stop people from choking to death. The Dechoker was marketed as FDA-approved—but the government agency had not only never approved the device, it told the Carvers to stop selling the product entirely in 2023, records show. Anti-choking devices have been shown to be potentially more harmful than helpful, and Amazon began removing the Dechoker and rival unapproved suction devices after Forbes asked the retailer about them.
Brown University became the latest institution to reject a deal with the Trump Administration that would have provided special federal funding considerations in exchange for widespread changes to its policies. In a letter to government officials, the school’s president said the deal would “restrict academic freedom” and undermine the autonomy of its governance.
The U.S. military is considering land strikes against Venezuelan drug cartels, President Donald Trump told reporters Wednesday, a potential escalation of the controversial military operations aimed at curbing drug smuggling into the U.S. The president also said he had authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations in the country, and alleged that Venezuela’s top officials have “emptied their prisons into the United States of America.”
Inflation and tariff disruptions have had a big impact on the cost of your morning cup of joe, as coffee prices have risen more than 20% since August 2024, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In July, President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 50% on Brazil and 20% on Vietnam, the two countries that together produce more than half of the world’s coffee beans.
For decades, Stanford Health Care had been trying to install a state-of-the-art proton therapy machine to add to its array of high tech cancer treatments. But try as it might, it just couldn’t find a place to put one.
Three years ago, Stanford found an alternative: Startup Leo Cancer Care had developed a variation on the standard proton therapy machine design. Instead of rotating the radiation beam around a patient laying flat in a bed, it used a chair in which a seated patient rotated around the beam. That seemingly simple change had transformative consequences. It helped trim the space required for the machine to about 1,700 square feet from more than 29,000 square feet—a more than 90% reduction. That made it significantly less expensive and easier to fit where they wanted it. So Stanford teamed up Leo Cancer Care, which makes the chair and imaging technology, with Mevion Medical Systems, which had developed a small proton accelerator, and in 2024 they started building out the new facility.
It’s still early days for Leo Cancer Care, and this is a hard and capital-intensive business. But the company, which has raised a total of $150 million at a valuation of $280 million, including a recent $40 million round led by Catalio Capital Management, is gaining traction. Revenue reached $11 million last year, and is expected to more than double this year.
WHY IT MATTERS The number of proton therapy machines in use today is tiny: There are only 46 proton centers in the U.S. and just over 100 worldwide, Leo Cancer Care cofounder and CEO Stephen Towe said, while the global need for them is closer to 2,000. Proton therapy provides greater targeting in cancer treatment, allowing patients to receive effective therapy with less damage to normal tissue and lower radiation risk, but its cost has been prohibitive.

While President Donald Trump continues to gamble with the U.S. economy—threatening tariffs, chickening out on tariffs, attempting to bully the Federal Reserve, interfering with the Bureau of Labor Statistics, laying off massive numbers of government employees, and deporting an even higher number of people, all while lining his own pockets—American workers are the ones who will pay the price.
Economists surveyed recently by The Wall Street Journal believe a labor market slowdown is ahead: They forecast the economy will create fewer than 50,000 jobs a month over the next year, down from earlier expectations. It’s just one sign of impending gloom: Mark Zandi of Moody’s Analytics published an analysis showing that 22 states are already in or close to a recession. Hiring has stalled; people are “hugging” their jobs. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that there are “significant downside risks” in the economy.
But as long the Fed keeps giving Trump and his investor-class cronies the interest rate cuts they’ve have been clamoring for—one last month, and almost certainly another one coming this month—and the stock market keeps soaring to all-time highs, Trump doesn’t care about the economic damage he’s causing. He probably relishes it, in fact, because he’s smashing yet another accomplishment of President Joe Biden.
Revisionist historians may try to say otherwise, but Biden—despite coming into an office during a once-in-a-century pandemic that killed more than a million Americans, spiked unemployment, and massively disrupted the global economy—had a fairly solid record when it came to his economic policies. Throughout his administration, Biden and his advisers had one North Star they followed: helping American workers. And in doing so, they left Trump with a robust labor market.
Even with the BLS downward revisions to the number of jobs added during Biden’s last year in office, his economy fundamentally added jobs, and wages rose from the bottom up throughout his term. More than that, Biden was a pro-labor president through and through. He was the first president to walk a picket line, joining a United Auto Workers strike in Michigan in 2023. The symbolism was important, but Biden also backed it up with policy: He strengthened the National Labor Relations Board and used regulations to prevent employers from misclassifying employees as independent contractors, protect all workers from heat stroke, and recover stolen wages.
Those pro-worker policies didn’t stop with the NLRB or Department of Labor. Biden’s Federal Trade Commission chair, Lina Khan, made a name for herself by trying to modernize antitrust policy. She went after corporations in Silicon Valley and beyond that were treating workers poorly, and banned noncompete policies. The administration also wove pro-worker policies into its congressional agenda. The Inflation Reduction Act, which supercharged the U.S. green energy economy, ensured that workers hired for American manufacturing jobs were well paid. Those policies, combined with the tight labor market after the Covid lockdowns ended, increased worker organizing and gave labor more bargaining power than it had seen in decades.
Despite photo ops trying to prove that he understands American workers, Trump has been hurrying to reverse nearly every pro-worker regulation enacted under Biden. He’s also laid off the federal workforce in such numbers that it will diminish the number of jobs available while growing the ranks of the unemployed, who will compete for jobs in a private market where businesses are now freed of many of Biden’s new rules.
Americans are feeling the tough job market. They’re worried they will lose their jobs and not at all confident they’ll be able to find a new one. CEOs are nervous too, meaning they’re less likely to increase hiring. Some employers, instead of investing in job creation, are betting on artificial intelligence. Young workers with the least experience are the most affected, but employers’ use of AI is making work harder for everyone because, it turns out, AI is bad at most jobs. (AI is mainly good at making rich people richer.)
Add the labor market woes to the affordability crisis and the Republicans’ slashes to the safety net, and Americans are in for a rough time ahead. The weakening economy means Trump will likely get more interest rate cuts, and the market will likely continue climbing on AI hype, but that won’t make borrowing or buying homes more achievable for people who’ve lost their job (or fear losing it).
Voters trusted Trump on the economy, at least more than they trusted Biden. Time and again on the campaign trail, Trump made hyperbolic promises like, “Starting on day one, we will end inflation and make America affordable again, to bring down the prices of all goods.” And: “Starting on day one, we will end inflation and make America affordable again. We’ll do that. We’ve got to bring it down.” And: “A vote for Trump means your groceries will be cheaper.”
As we now know, voters were wrong to believe Trump. It is day 270 of his presidency, and inflation continues to climb. Grocery prices are at record highs. Workers’ wallets are getting hammered, and we are only at the dawn of the Trump economy.

Low-cost carrier Avelo Airlines is shaking up its fleet.
In September, the carrier inked a $4.4 billion deal with Brazilian planemaker Embraer for 50 of its newest jets, the E195-E2, with deliveries scheduled to begin in 2027. The new planes will fly alongside Avelo's existing fleet of Boeing 737s.
It's a big moment for Embraer and US aviation: Avelo, which launched in 2021, is the first US airline to purchase the E2.
Until now, the jet failed to gain traction in the US market because of the regional pilot union's ""scope clause,"" which limits the size and weight of planes that regional affiliates can operate.
These agreements, intended to protect mainline pilot jobs at places like Delta and United, cap outsourced flying to aircraft weighing less than 86,000 pounds — well below the E2's weight. This means that only independent airlines, like Avelo, can operate it.
Embraer Commercial Aviation president and CEO Arjan Meijer said during the company's Investor Day on Tuesday that the E-2 is quieter than its rivals, burns less fuel per seat, and comes with a 2x2 cabin layout, meaning no dreaded middle seats.
Avelo CFO Hunter Keay said that the plane's automatic takeoff capability will help the airline reach smaller airports in secondary markets because it can operate on shorter runways where Avelo's 737s cannot.
This opens the door to many more cities on the map, some of which Keay said don't currently have any commercial traffic.
Avelo opted for the E-2 over the rival Airbus A220, a plane with a longer range and higher capacity, but that would likely take longer to arrive due to supply chain bottlenecks.
Business Insider toured the jet during the 2024 Farnborough Airshow in England. Here's what travelers can expect onboard:
The E-2, nicknamed the ""Profit Hunter,"" has a 2x2 cabin with two sets of seats on either side of the aisle. The pictured Embraer-installed seats have headrests, which may not appear in Avelo's no-frills cabin.
The A220, by comparison, features a 3x2 layout, as seen on carriers such as Delta and Breeze Airways.
Embraer has introduced larger overhead bins on its E195-E2 that can accommodate hand luggage with wheels first, rather than horizontally.
This is expected to reduce the number of gate-checked bags.
The E-2's two Pratt & Whitney PW1900G GTF engines contribute to its attractive fuel burn; however, the powerplants are facing technical issues that have led some airlines, such as Dutch airline KLM Cityhopper, to ground some jets.
The P&W-equipped A220 is also battling engine issues that have grounded some airline fleets entirely.
There is less competition in secondary markets, and Avelo can fly routes where it doesn't compete with other carriers.
For example, the airline is already the sole carrier on routes like New Haven, Connecticut, to San Juan, Puerto Rico; and Hartford, Connecticut, to Montego Bay, Jamaica.
Budget airlines typically operate a single type of plane. For Southwest Airlines, that's the Boeing 737. For Spirit Airlines and Frontier Airlines, it's the Airbus A320 family.
The strategy keeps maintenance, training, and labor costs down; however, a multi-fleet — especially one with two different manufacturers — creates a more complex system.
Even though the plane is new, it doesn't mean Avelo is revamping its entire experience.
Keay said the airline is keeping its no-frills business model, meaning travelers can still expect cramped seats and no free entertainment or WiFi.
Its Boeing 737 standard coach seats offer 29 inches of pitch.
These seats offer more space and padding compared to standard economy seats.
Many budget carriers, such as Spirit and Frontier, are trending toward offering more premium options.
It's unclear if Avelo will follow suit, though it does offer extra-legroom bulkhead rows and rows with the middle seat blocked.
The A220 remains the more dominant plane in the US, as larger non-scope-clause restricted airlines, such as Breeze and JetBlue, have opted for the European-made jet over the E-2.
And there are very few classic E-Jets still flying for budget carriers. JetBlue Airways recently retired its last one in September, and Breeze plans to phase out its E-Jets by mid-2026.

Contributor.
Let’s begin with a difficult truth: the Shiller PE ratio of the S&P 500 is currently just under 40. If you’re curious as to why this should alarm you, let’s place it within a historical framework.
What exactly is the Shiller PE telling us? The Shiller PE — also referred to as the Cyclically Adjusted PE Ratio (CAPE) — takes the current value of the benchmark index and divides it by the 10-year average of inflation-adjusted earnings of index components, which helps to mitigate the effects of business cycles and offers a clearer view of sustainable earning potential. When this ratio reaches extreme heights, it indicates that investors are paying excessively for each dollar of historical earnings.
Here’s an essential inquiry: How extreme is a Shiller PE of 40?
Robert Shiller voiced his concerns in 2014 when the figure surpassed 25, highlighting this as ""a level that has only been exceeded since 1881 during three past periods: the years surrounding 1929, 1999, and 2007."" And what transpired after each of those peaks? Catastrophic market crashes.
We will explore the details in the following sections. However, if these valuation worries lead you to reconsider your broad market exposure, some strategies could potentially offer upside with less volatility compared to holding individual stocks or navigating the full beta of the S&P 500. Consider the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. It has significantly outperformed its benchmark—a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has generated returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is this the case? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided improved returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster experience, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
Let’s review what transpired the last 3 times the Shiller PE reached levels above 32:
In September 1929, the Shiller PE ratio climbed to nearly 32.6, and the notorious stock market crash followed the next month. The result? The S&P 500 dropped over 83% during the Great Depression, while the Dow eventually fell 89% from its peak to its lowest point in the summer of 1932. Even more concerning: An investor who entered the market at the previous high on August 31, 1929, would have suffered negative returns for more than 25 years until September 1945 (excluding dividends).
The Shiller PE ratio achieved an all-time high of 44.19 in December 1999, just before the technology bubble burst. What was the outcome? From its apex on March 24, 2000, to its trough on October 9, 2002, the S&P 500 declined by 49%.
For perspective on how drastic market downturns can be, our dashboard – How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash – illustrates how key stocks performed during and after the last seven market crashes, providing insight into potential recession scenarios.
The Shiller PE ratio peaked at approximately 38.6 in late 2021 — the second-highest reading in history following the dot-com bubble. From its high of 4,796 on January 3, 2022, the S&P 500 fell 25% to its low in October 2022. The index officially entered bear market territory in June 2022, declining more than 20% from its high. For the entire year of 2022, the S&P 500 recorded a decline of approximately 19%, marking its poorest performance since 2008.
If we take these historical benchmarks and apply them to today’s S&P 500 (standing at 6,671 as of October 15, 2025), the possible downside becomes disturbingly apparent:
It’s notable that the 2022 correction took place at a Shiller PE level almost identical to what we see today. Despite that shock less than 3 years ago, market valuations have now risen even further! Even if we consider that we might face a moderate correction similar to the one witnessed in 2022, one fact is undeniable: when valuations hit these extremes, the market typically reverts toward its long-term average.
However, extreme valuations are not acting in isolation. Today’s market confronts a troubling confluence of challenges:
These risks are not isolated—they are interconnected threats that have the potential to amplify one another. A rise in inflation induced by tariffs may compel the Fed to maintain higher rates for an extended period, putting pressure on corporate margins as government debt service costs increase. It’s a cacophony of negative factors that could hit the markets hard, especially when starting from such inflated valuations.
Nonetheless, honesty requires that we contemplate scenarios where the bears could be incorrect. Here are convincing explanations as to why markets might continue to rise despite these warnings:
The actual risk of downside for the S&P 500 from current levels is 25-50%.
Here’s the rationale:
A detailed breakdown:
Timeline considerations: Out of 21 significant market declines since 1950, the Shiller PE Ratio issued warnings for 10 of these by breaching its long-term average. While the ratio isn’t a precise timing tool, historical patterns imply elevated risk within a 1-3 year timeframe.
How should investors position themselves in this climate?
In light of the considerable downside risks highlighted above, investing in a single stock without thorough analysis can be especially hazardous when overall market valuations are stretched. Under such circumstances, diversification and systematic approaches are vital.
Consider strategies such as the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has surpassed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to yield strong returns for investors. Why is this so? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive solution to leverage favorable market conditions while mitigating losses when markets decline, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics. In the face of a potential 40-60% downside, strategies that can ""limit losses when markets head south"" are especially crucial.
The market often has a way of testing the confidence of its most certain participants. While the weight of historical evidence indicates significant downside risk, markets have consistently defied gravity when skeptics were most convinced of their downfall.
What’s certain is this: investors at today’s valuations are paying remarkably high prices in relation to historical norms. Whether this price is warranted by a truly new paradigm or signifies yet another chapter in the timeless narrative of speculative excess will only become clear in hindsight.
The prudent approach? Recognize the risk, size positions appropriately, and keep liquidity for opportunities. Overall, it would be wise to exercise a degree of caution and refrain from absolute certainty in any one direction. Those who display the greatest confidence often find themselves at the highest risk of being caught off guard."

Stock indexes have been breaking records in 2025. That’s not unusual: The stock market tends to rise. 
What is atypical, economists say, is the historically high ratio of stock prices to corporate earnings.  
Price-to-earnings ratios tell you if a stock is overvalued or undervalued. A common yardstick, the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, or CAPE ratio, stands at 39.65 for the S&P 500.  
The last time – indeed, the only time – it ranged that high before was at the peak of the dot-com bubble, in 1999-2000. The CAPE ratio also spiked in 1929, just before the Great Depression.   
Are we in another bubble? Will the market crash? The answer to those questions depends on whom you ask.  
In a recent speech, Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned that stock prices “are fairly highly valued.” To many listeners, Powell was saying stocks are overpriced.  
In market comments on Oct. 14, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told reporters, “You have a lot of assets out there which look like they’re entering bubble territory.”  
Every day or two, another op-ed piece or financial headline reminds us we may be living in another bubble, buoyed by unrealistic hopes about the profitability of AI. Other pundits disagree, arguing that companies are turning profits and the market is fundamentally sound.  
AI and tech giants have driven the massive stock gains of the past decade. Collectively, the “Magnificent Seven” earned 698% between 2015 and 2024, according to The Motley Fool. The S&P 500 as a whole returned a comparatively modest 178% in those years. 
If we’re in a bubble, analysts say, those stocks helped inflate it.  
Already, many investors are turning to cash. Money market funds held a record $7.7 trillion in assets in September, The Wall Street Journal reported. 
Money market funds are paying higher returns than in the past. With stocks potentially overvalued, some investors are content to sit on the sidelines. 
That does not mean, however, that an everyday investor should cash out of stocks and put every dollar in cash. 
Here’s the theory: If you pull out of a “bubble” market when it’s high, you can wait until the market falls, then put your money back into stocks, buying the dip. 
It sounds foolproof. Investment experts warn, however, that it’s hard to get the timing right. 
“Any time you’re trying to avoid a downturn, the risk of being wrong is pretty high,” said Peter Lazaroff, a certified financial planner in St. Louis. “And you have to be correct twice.” 
As Lazaroff explains, you have to make two decisions: When to sell high, and when to buy low. Those calls are harder than they sound.  
Sell high? The market might close at a record one day, then set another record the next day. You won’t know the peak until it’s past. 
Buy low? In the Great Recession, the Dow lost more than half of its value between 2007 and 2009. If you had bought back in on any day in 2008, you would have missed the bottom. 
“The problem is, we’ve seen over and over that actually implementing an approach like that is very difficult,” said Amy Arnott, portfolio strategist at Morningstar. “You end up missing out on some gains.” 
But there’s nothing to stop you from having some cash on hand to hedge against a bubbly stock market.  
Financial advisers routinely tell older clients to dial down their stocks as they approach retirement. The idea is to insulate yourself against the market’s inherent volatility, and to have sufficient cash to cover your expenses in a downturn. 
“Right now, I’m telling clients to shore up their cash,” said Zaneilia Harris, a certified financial planner in Washington, DC. “Just in case something is needed, you’re not pulling from your portfolio when it’s down.” 
Younger investors and retirement savers might consider building some cash reserves, Harris said, even if it’s only a small percentage of their investable dollars.  
Should stocks fall, anyone with cash will have an opportunity to buy shares at a discount. 
“If you don’t have cash to put in the market when it’s down, you’re missing an opportunity,” Dwyer said.  
If the market falls, even a cash-strapped investor can get in on sale-priced stocks.  
“If you don’t have any cash sitting around and we see a big market drop, increase your 401(k) contribution, bump it up a percent or two,” Dwyer said. “You’re probably not even going to notice it.”  
A higher 401(k) contribution will scoop up more shares of discounted stock in a downturn. It’s another way to buy low.  "
86,2025-10-16,"Paris-based Lise (Lightning Stock Exchange) has become the first company in Europe authorized to operate a fully tokenized equity exchange, the company said on Thursday.
The exchange, which targets the SME IPO market in France, received a DLT TSS license from France’s financial regulator, the ACPR, under the EU’s Distributed Ledger Technology Pilot Regime, according to a press release.
The authorization, developed with input from the Banque de France, ESMA, AMF, and the European Central Bank, allows Lise to combine the roles of a Multilateral Trading Facility (MTF) and a Central Securities Depository (CSD) within one digital framework.
Lise counts among its shareholders CACEIS (a subsidiary of the Crédit Agricole Group), BNP Paribas, and Bpifrance. The tokenization-friendly exchange targets French firms with market capitalizations below €500 million ($582m), and seeks at least half of the issuers to be SMEs with valuations under €200 million.
“This license allows us to operate the first fully tokenized equity exchange in Europe, offering a direct response to real-world financing challenges,” said Mark Kepeneghian, Lise’s CEO.
Lise plans to list its first SME and midcap IPOs in early 2026, focusing on sectors such as energy, infrastructure, and defense.
For investors, the model could make exposure to Europe’s smaller growth firms easier and more transparent. For policymakers, it represents a test case in using blockchain technology to simplify and modernize capital markets.

Opendoor Technologies stock (NASDAQ: OPEN) recently experienced a significant drop, falling 27.7% from $10.21 on September 17, 2025, to its current price of $7.38. This decline is attributed to a combination of factors: first, a correction from its earlier ""meme rally"" as investors locked in profits; and second, persistent and intense criticism of its business model and profitability, notably voiced by a prominent hedge fund manager.
Given these challenges, the critical question for investors is whether this sharp price drop represents a genuine buying opportunity. Buying the dip is a reasonable strategy for quality stocks that have a history of bouncing back from declines.
It turns out, OPEN stock passes basic quality assessments. However, the concerning news is that the stock has returned (median) -41% in one year, and 39% as peak return after historically experiencing sharp dips (>30% in 30 days). For some context, OPEN offers a digital platform for the buying and selling of residential real estate online in the U.S., including title insurance and escrow services.
For more information on stock fundamentals and analysis: Read Buy or Sell Opendoor Technologies Stock to view the complete picture. OPEN stock has declined considerably recently, and we currently consider it fairly valued. This may sound like a warning, and relying on a single stock does carry significant risk. However, a broader diversified approach provides considerable value. Strategic asset allocation and diversification assist you in staying invested. Did you realize that investors who sold off from the S&P in 2020 missed out on the substantial gains that followed? Trefis High Quality Portfolio and Empirical Asset Management’s asset allocation method are crafted to minimize volatility, allowing you to maintain your investment strategy.
OPEN has faced 11 instances since 1/1/2010 where the dip threshold of -30% within 30 days was activated
Revenue growth, profitability, cash flow, and balance sheet strength must be reviewed to mitigate the risk of a dip signaling a worsening business situation. 
While dip buying may be appealing, it should be assessed thoroughly from various perspectives. This multi-faceted analysis is precisely how we develop Trefis portfolio strategies. For those seeking upside potential with a more stable experience than a single stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, achieving over 105% returns since its inception."
88,2025-10-16,"Some of Johannesburg's most promising young designers joined forces for an exhibition at Design Week South Africa, using locally found and discarded materials to rewrite the narrative about their city.
The Price of Gold brought together work by 11 emerging talents inside Victoria Yards – a community space set in a converted steam laundry in the city's Central Business District (CBD).
The innercity area has become notorious for its high crime rates and crumbling infrastructure since it was abandoned by big businesses and politicians following the end of Apartheid.
But The Price of Gold exhibition showcases the work of local designers and makers, who have found ways to make use of its hidden riches, whether scrap metal or Europe's exported fashion waste, to create a kind of love letter to the city.
""The government has really given up on Johannesburg,"" curator Nkhensani Mkhari told Dezeen. ""You can see it in how the city decays. But we still love it.""
""What the city asks of each and every one of us is to take charge of your life,"" he added. ""How can you empower yourself, even when the circumstances aren't really favourable? How can you make do?""
""I think that's quintessentially Joburg,"" he added.
In this spirit, the exhibition relies heavily on reclaimed materials sourced within the city limits.
Fashion designer Khumo Morojele created Johannesburg's equivalent of the iconic ""I ♥ NY"" T-shirts, using pieces of discarded clothing sourced from vendors in Dunusa, a sprawling second-hand market in the CBD.
""Joburg has come through a lot of paradigm shifts,"" Morojele explained, nodding to its history as a gold rush mining town founded by white settlers.
""We're very interested in shifting it again to highlight the people that actually put in the work to sustain this city,"" he added. ""Right now, a lot of the aspiration is to Western ways of doing things and Western culture.""
""But within town, within the centre of Joburg, is where all the culture comes from. And that's the real gold.""
In the exhibition, his T-shirts were sold alongside pieces from local streetwear brands Frndly, Franasonic and Shwelabana, displayed in giant shrink-wrapped bales that recall the packaging in which mountains of discarded clothes from the West arrive in South Africa.
Nearby, Morojele also exhibited a series of patchwork T-shirts conceived during workshops with upcyclers at the Kantamanto second-hand market in Accra, Ghana, together with fellow designers Klein Muis and Berendja Valkeman.
The resulting pieces speak to the power of garments as cultural and political signifiers, combining European football shirts with the logos of luxury fashion brands and images of former US president Barack Obama.
Johannesburg fashion designer Thato Nzimande also worked with second-hand clothing to stage an imagined future storefront, providing an Afrofuturistic vision of what womenswear might look like without colonisation.
Elsewhere in the exhibition, vintage furniture brand Respect Your Elders exhibited modernist pieces sourced from local second-hand markets and refurbished with unexpected textiles, including Wassily Chairs finished with faux fur and Persian rugs.
Similarly, engineer-turned-sculptor Kutlwano Makwela created a female figure, nicknamed Johannesburg's Statue of Liberty, using industrial scrap metal from the local area.
""How do you take something that nobody cares about and make them care,"" Mkhari questioned. ""That's what I've been thinking about the whole time while putting this show together.""
The curator also brought in several projects that provide a sense of Johannesburg's history, among them a metal light sculpture with cutouts reminiscent of cave paintings by artists James Delaney and Lady Skollie, and textile works covered in handmade earth pigments by architect Mandy Schindler.
More contemporary impressions come from director Jack Markovitz and his three-channel film Eyesore, which compares his own impressions of Johannesburg with archival footage shot by his mother.
A soundscape by musician Shanti Cullis incorporates recordings of the city's streets, while artist Francesco Mbele created a slide show of photographs from the 1970s through to the 1990s, sourced during his weekly trips to the Rosebank Sunday Market.
South African president Cyril Ramaphosa recently described Johannesburg as ""not a pleasing environment"" and launched a task force to take it ""back to its glory days"" ahead of the G20 summits set to take place here next month.
But Mkhari compares Johannesburg today to New York in the 1970s or East London pre-gentrification, when abandoned spaces and cheap rents created a haven for local artists and creatives.
""Everybody is super nostalgic about that period – and we're there now,"" the curator explained. ""The great thing about the city is that it's generous. It's inexpensive to live in and that creates room for possibility.""
""We didn't have money to do this exhibition,"" he added. ""We just did it. We did it off of small donations, and everybody just getting their hands dirty.""

Your boss might not want to know the real you after all.
One of the many pieces of career advice that emerged years ago and has somehow persisted is the idea that we should bring our whole selves to work.
That doesn't always work, and it's starting to look a bit threadbare with age, especially as the job market has cooled and employers can be more selective about those they hire.
""If you love wearing tight little leather outfits that are strapped on, I don't want to see that,"" said Margie Warrell, a leadership consultant and author of the book ""The Courage Gap.""
""That's not appropriate,"" she told Business Insider.
The whole-self idea is just one example of bumper-sticker wisdom that was meant to guide us through our careers but often doesn't hold up.
Here are six bits of trite work advice — and what to consider instead:
The impulse to align your work with what you love makes sense. Yet, feeling like you have to ""find your passion"" can also set you up to fail.
""That's probably as vague as it gets,"" said Jochen Menges, a professor of human resource management and leadership at the University of Zurich. ""It's not an actionable goal.""
He told Business Insider that a better approach would be to set goals centered on the emotion you want to feel in your work, such as pride, even though you might not experience it every day.
""If I align my emotional needs more with what I do — with my career prospects — then I'm a lot better off,"" he said. That, in turn, will accelerate your career, Menges said.
When you're looking for a job, it can be tempting to apply to as many roles as possible to boost your chances of getting something. 
It's an especially tempting tactic, given how often people report applying and never hearing back. In a LinkedIn survey conducted in late 2024 across more than a dozen countries, 37% of respondents said they had been applying more but hearing back less often.
While the spray-and-pray approach might be appealing, it's not always the best option. That's because networking to make connections inside an employer can often be more effective, recruiters say.
If you have a list of places you're targeting, you can — and should — network before the job gets posted, veteran career coach Laura Labovich told Business Insider.​​ That's because once a job listing is live, recruiters and hiring managers aren't likely to do more than point you to the application.
On a ladder, you can only go up or down.
The idea of scaling a corporate hierarchy has become outdated for many workers, Christian Tröster, an Academy of Management scholar and a professor of leadership and organizational behavior at Germany's Kühne Logistics University, told Business Insider.
Instead, he said, people might want to consider what he called a ""protean"" career — one that changes shape over time.
Tröster said that rather than ascending a ladder, a better aim for many workers would be to become ""psychologically successful.""
""The ultimate goal of your career is feeling proud and accomplished,"" he said.
One practical reason you might not want to climb the ladder is that a push by some corporate leaders for ""flatter"" organizational structures — and an elimination of middle management — can mean there aren't as many rungs for ambitious workers to grab onto.
""Careers today are no longer linear,"" Warrell said. Instead, workers might opt for a lateral move, a side gig, or a so-called portfolio career, where you take on multiple jobs to earn a living while maintaining flexibility.
Warrell said that workers who chart their own paths are often more fulfilled than those who try to grind their way up an org chart.
Career advice once often included the suggestion that workers avoid changing jobs for at least a year to avoid appearing as though they weren't committed to an organization.
While a string of frequent job changes can raise concerns among prospective employers, Warrell said prohibitions on job-hopping have often softened.
She said ""smart"" job changes — even in relatively quick succession — that indicate you're taking on extra responsibility and developing new skills can add polish, not tarnish, to a résumé.
""It can be seen as a sign of ambition, adaptability — not instability,"" Warrell said.
Technical mastery — especially in hot areas like artificial intelligence — can take you far and often leave you with your pick of jobs. Yet it's not the only route to career success.
AI is already taking on some coders' work, for example. In surveys, employers often say they're after so-called soft skills — abilities such as communication and teamwork.
Menges said one reason soft skills are important is that humans will still often be needed to evaluate what AI produces.
To help do that, he said, workers will need to rely in part on emotion for guidance. Menges said that in the 20th century, workers were often told to sequester their feelings in the workplace.
""Now, you've got to bring those emotions back, because whatever AI does needs evaluation, and that evaluation comes down to how we feel about what appears on our screens,"" he said.
While it might have been well-intentioned, critics have long found the idea of showing up at work as the unvarnished version of yourself to be problematic.
Business leaders, including Google's Sundar Pichai and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, have pushed back on the concept.
Ella F. Washington, a professor of practice at Georgetown University, previously told Business Insider that a better way to think about the idea is to bring your whole professional self to work.
That might mean putting aside your politics or working with people you might not like. Or, Warrell said, it could mean pushing through a bad mood.
""If one part of your whole self is that you're short-tempered and grumpy in the morning, don't bring that self to work,"" she said.

But he has a serious point.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Any indie developer will be able to tell you that designing and making a video game is only part of the job. You also need to market the game if you want people to actually play it, and that can sometimes be the most difficult and disheartening part.
Marketing a video game might not throw up the technical challenges involved in making it, but it can require just as much creativity, as one indie dev recently demonstrated with an unusually blunt approach (for help on the making side of things, see our guides to the best game engines and the best laptop for game development).
Solo indie developer Marty PixelRod hit the streets of downtown Greenville, South Carolina, to try to drum up interest in his gameplay trailer ahead of today's release of new mini-metroidvania, Prototype Juan: A Tale of Two Mundos. The video is in jest, but he has a serious point: marketing a video game can be hard, and it needs a more strategic approach than simply throwing it out there
Many developers will be able to relate to Marty as he stands forlornly on the high street with his laptop in front of him, hoping that at least one passerby might show interest in his game. It will feel like an apt analogy for those who have been there watching their Steam wishlist slowly tick up in single figures.
Clearly this isn't how to market an indie game. but how should you do it? Below, I've rounded up a few tips from some of the developers we've featured in our Indie Game Dev Insider series (by the way, you can find Prototype Juan: A Tale of Two Mundos on Steam today if you want to show Marty some support).
New game developers often want to crack on with making the game and worry about marketing later. That's totally understandable since you might not feel confident enough to start shouting about a game if you don't know when you'll finish it, and mastering the challenges that come up in development can be enough work if you're a solo developer.
But if you want your game to get somewhere and not remain a personal project, you need to start marketing at the same time you start making it, and that includes showing early development.
Daily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors.
Look at how established developers and even film studios market their products: the hype often begins long before release. There might be an initial tease to generate curiosity in niche audiences, and then an announcement trailer, a cinematic trailer, a gameplay trailer and eventually the launch trailer. Every step plays a role in ensuring that people know about the product by the time it's ready for release.
The first step in marketing anything is research and strategy. That means thinking about who will play your game, how you can reach them and what kind of message will appeal to them. Ideally, even your development decisions will be based on market research. For example, you might choose to focus on an emerging subgenre, a old concept that was ripe for a revival, or a genre that's popular but has little competition compared to others.
Find out who your competitors are, compare their price points and see if you can identify what caused any spikes in wishlist velocity (data providers like Gamalytic.commay help here). And make sure you're clear on what unique selling proposition (USP) will make your game different or better.
It can feel like a slog, but successful marketing requires consistency and constant momentum. Use multiple marketing actions that amplify each other. That could mean making a new trailer and using it in different ways, providing development updates, asking for feedback and running playtests to find bugs.
Basic marketing essentials include an up-to-date website and easily locatable press kit. Festivals are a great place to get visibility. There are lots of official events run by steam but also 3rd party festivals. And a demo is essential to boost your wishlist and to gain more promotional opportunities.
An email newsletter isn't a must but it provides a way to keep communicating directly with your audience to keep them engaged, and it doesn't depend on the whims of social media algorithms. We have a guide to the best free blog platforms.
Try to time announcements strategically. This could include timing demo updates around big festivals and approaching media and content creators ahead of events. For the latter, focus on those that have shown an interest in your genre, and send them a key and a personalised message. You could offer an exclusive trailer or demo release in exchange. You might also want to consider paid ads on platforms such as Reddit, YouTube and Facebook, but this can become expensive.
 



Steam is key for visibility. Your game's page should have quality capsule art, an engaging description of the game and should accurately communicate what players can expect. Check GameStat's Steam tag statistics to choose the best tags for your game.
Wishlists are Steam's main metric, which it uses to measure the popularity of games. If you can create spikes in wishlist velocity (the speed at which people wishlist your game), there's a chance the algorithm could put you in a featured section like 'Popular Upcoming' or 'New & Trending'. Demos may now appear in 'Trending Free', which is another reason why a good demo is so important.
Aim to build a community around your game starting early in development. Your first fans can become enthusiastic allies and ambassadors, amplifying the hype around your game. Use social Media and interact with potential players naturally. Reshare user-generated content (UGC) and run surveys to invite honest feedback on bugs and features. You can also holding contests, giveaways or tournaments as incentives.
Discord is a popular choice, and many devs opt to direct people there from other channels and content. Early members on your channel can provide insights into how to reach your target audience while also helping you fix problems. For story-based games, a spoilers channel will allow people to talk about the story without ruining it for others.
X, the ex-Twitter, might seem like a graveyard sometimes these days, but it can be good for targeting trending hashtags and starting a conversation. Try 'ask me anything' posts, and get fans to engage early for a bump in engagement. Also see our roundup of the best social media sites for creatives.
Finally, remember that every post and every comment is a chance to show your game to the world, even if you're just asking other devs for help in online forums. Even if it's not a marketing post, take the opportunity to talk about your game and communicate its selling point.

Apple just launched their new Apple TV and Peacock bundle, which lets you subscribe to both for a discounted price. While you can purchase the bundle individually, Apple One subscribers have a special benefit: they can purchase a Peacock subscription separately with a 35% discount, if subscribed to the Family or Premier plan.
In their press release for this new bundle, there was one line I found particularly interesting (my emphasis):
Apple One subscribers on the Family and Premier plans can subscribe to Peacock Premium Plus and receive a 35 percent discount — the first benefit of its kind for Apple’s all-in-one subscription bundle.
In a market based on subscription services, offering external partnerships has been increasingly popular. Competitors like Amazon Prime have long offered external benefits and discounts, such as free Grubhub+ and gas station discounts. 
Apple specifically mentions that this 35% discount is the first benefit of this kind for Apple One subscribers. I don’t think it’s unreasonable to assume that Apple may be working on launching more benefits like this. After all, Apple has been increasing their number of partnerships, such as offering an MLS subscription, streaming Friday Night Baseball on Apple TV, and now the new Peacock discount. Outside of subscriptions, they also heavily lean into Apple-exclusive carrier deals for new iPhones.
What do you think? Will Apple offer more third-party partnerships in the future? Who would you like to see them partner with?

93,2025-10-16,"The second-largest publicly traded ether treasury firm, SharpLink Gaming (SBET), has raised $76.5 million in a direct stock offering priced above market.
The Minneapolis-based company said in a press release it sold 4.5 million shares at $17 per share, a 12% premium over its $15.15 closing price on Oct. 15.
The sale price also reflected a premium to the company's net asset value of its 840,124 ETH holdings, reflecting what the company called “strong institutional confidence” in its strategy.
An unnamed institutional investor bought the shares and received a 90-day option to buy another 4.5 million shares at $17.50.
The firm’s ether holdings are second only to that of Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), which currently has 3.03 million ETH in its treasury.
SBET is higher by 3.7 to $15.57 in early Thursday trade alongside a modest bounce in the price of ETH to back above $4,000.

99,2025-10-16,"Chronic wounds are a major health problem for diabetic patients and the elderly – in extreme cases they can even lead to amputation. Using electric stimulation, researchers in a project at Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, and the University of Freiburg, Germany, have developed a method that speeds up the healing process, making wounds heal three times faster.
There is an old Swedish saying that one should never neglect a small wound or a friend in need. For most people, a small wound does not lead to any serious complications, but many common diagnoses make wound healing far more difficult. People with diabetes, spinal injuries or poor blood circulation have impaired wound healing ability. This means a greater risk of infection and chronic wounds – which in the long run can lead to such serious consequences as amputation.
Now a group of researchers at Chalmers and the University of Freiburg have developed a method using electric stimulation to speed up the healing process.
“Chronic wounds are a huge societal problem that we don’t hear a lot about. Our discovery of a method that may heal wounds up to three times faster can be a game changer for diabetic and elderly people, among others, who often suffer greatly from wounds that won’t heal,” says Maria Asplund, Professor of Bioelectronics at Chalmers University of Technology and head of research on the project.
The researchers worked from an old hypothesis that electric stimulation of damaged skin can be used to heal wounds. The idea is that skin cells are electrotactic, which means that they directionally ‘migrate’ in electric fields. This means that if an electric field is placed in a petri dish with skin cells, the cells stop moving randomly and start moving in the same direction. The researchers investigated how this principle can be used to electrically guide the cells in order to make wounds heal faster. Using a tiny engineered chip, the researchers were able to compare wound healing in artificial skin, stimulating one wound with electricity and letting one heal without electricity. The differences were striking.
“We were able to show that the old hypothesis about electric stimulation can be used to make wounds heal significantly faster. In order to study exactly how this works for wounds, we developed a kind of biochip on which we cultured skin cells, which we then made tiny wounds in. Then we stimulated one wound with an electric field, which clearly led to it healing three times as fast as the wound that healed without electric stimulation,” Asplund says.
In the study, the researchers also focused on wound healing in connection with diabetes, a growing health problem worldwide. One in 11 adults today has some form of diabetes according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Diabetes Federation.
“We’ve looked at diabetes models of wounds and investigated whether our method could be effective even in those cases. We saw that when we mimic diabetes in the cells, the wounds on the chip heal very slowly. However, with electric stimulation we can increase the speed of healing so that the diabetes-affected cells almost correspond to healthy skin cells,” Asplund says.
The Chalmers researchers recently received a large grant which will allow them to continue their research in the field, and in the long run enable the development of wound healing products for consumers on the market. Similar products have come out before, but more basic research is required to develop effective products that generate enough electric field strength and stimulate in the right way for each individual. This is where Asplund and her colleagues come into the picture:
“We are now looking at how different skin cells interact during stimulation, to take a step closer to a realistic wound. We want to develop a concept to be able to ‘scan’ wounds and adapt the stimulation based on the individual wound. We are convinced that this is the key to effectively helping individuals with slow-healing wounds in the future,” Asplund says.
• “Bioelectronic microfluidic wound healing: a platform for investigating direct current stimulation of injured cell collectives” was published in the journal Lab on a Chip. The article was written by Sebastian Shaner, Anna Savelyeva, Anja Kvartuh, Nicole Jedrusik, Lukas Matter, José Leal and Maria Asplund. The researchers work at the University of Freiburg in Germany and Chalmers University of Technology. • In their study, the researchers showed that wound healing on artificial skin stimulated with electric current was three times faster than on the skin that healed naturally. The electric field was low, about 200 mV/mm, and did not have a negative impact on the cells. • The method the researchers developed is based on a microfluidic biochip on which artificial skin can be grown, stimulated with an electric current and studied in an effective and controlled manner. The concept allows researchers to conduct multiple experiments in parallel on the same chip. • The research project began in 2018 and is funded by the European Research Council (ERC). The project was recently granted new funding so the research can get to market and benefit patients.
