Whether you're doing some holiday shopping or simply upgrading the home office, I just noticed one leftover Cyber Monday Chromebook deal that deserves your immediate attention. Best Buy has decided to extend a deal that carves $200 off the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus, an ultra-lightweight and versatile laptop that's well-suited for both work and play. 
We've tested dozens of Chromebooks over the years, and the Galaxy Chromebook Plus stands out as one of the best laptops we've used. That being said, it's not exactly cheap, which is why deals like this have become so crucial to shoppers.
Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus (8GB RAM / 256GB): $749.99 $549.99 at Best Buy
Head to Best Buy today and you'll get a straight $200 knocked off the price of the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus, one of our favorite Chromebooks on the market. The purchase also includes one year of the Google One AI Premium plan at no additional cost. 
The Galaxy Chromebook Plus is further proof that Samsung is the master of manufacturing sleek, lightweight devices that don't skimp on performance or cutting-edge features. 
Straight out of the box, the Chromebook Plus offers a gorgeous 15.6-inch AMOLED display with a 60Hz refresh rate, while under the hood you'll get a powerful Intel Core 3 100U chip and 8GB of RAM. There's also 256GB of expandable storage and a surprising number of ports, especially given that, at 11.8mm thick, the laptop is actually thinner than the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6. It's also the first Chromebook to come with the Quick Insert key, a new feature that lets you access Gemini and other streamlined AI features more easily. 
Of course, there are a few drawbacks with the Galaxy Chromebook Plus. For one, it doesn't have a touchscreen or a convertible design, and the battery life (estimated around 13 hours max) is a bit disappointing given the steep price tag. You also don't get a fingerprint scanner with the Galaxy Chromebook Plus, and you're limited to the 256GB storage configuration (although you can expand the storage using a microSD card). 
On a $300-$500 Chromebook, these issues wouldn't be a big deal, but I've come to expect more from laptops in the $750 range. Fortunately, this Best Buy discount places the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus much closer to where it needs to be, just in time for holiday shopping.

Uber might seem ubiquitous in the US, but its CFO says the company has lots of room to grow.
Across the 10 largest countries where Uber operates, about 15% of adults use either Uber for ride-hailing or delivery, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah said during a presentation at UBS' Global Technology and AI Conference on Wednesday. Uber and other consumer-focused companies often refer to this metric as ""market penetration.""
Uber's market penetration in the US ""is right in line with that 15% average,"" Mahendra-Rajah said. That means that Uber has yet to reach many customers in the country where it was founded, he said.
To Uber investors, that number might seem small given how prevalent Uber has become in many parts of the country, Mahendra-Rajah said at the conference.
Indeed, for many people who live in large US cities and turn to the app for rides to the airport or meal delivery, using Uber — or a rival app, such as Lyft or DoorDash — has become a habit.
But not everyone in the US uses Uber so frequently — or at all, Mahendra-Rajah said.
Among Uber investors, ""it's often a view of: 'There is no way I could use Uber anymore than I am, and there's no way my children can order Uber Eats more than they already do,'"" he said. 
""But you are really a unique case compared to the US average,"" he said. ""That's why we remain very optimistic.""
Uber has already built big businesses in ride-hailing and delivery. Still, there are multiple areas where it's trying to grow.
While many urbanites already use the app, Uber is also trying to get more users in the suburbs to turn to the app for rides to dinner or deliveries from Costco. Ride-hailing trips from suburbs — or ""sparser markets,"" as Uber executives have called them — make up about 20% of Uber's total trips, Mahendra-Rajah said earlier this year.
Rural areas, where ride-hailing trips and delivery distances tend to be longer, have also been relatively recent focuses for the apps.
Uber Eats is also adding more supermarket chains and other retailers as partners to expand its delivery business, Mahendra-Rajah said on Wednesday.
Uber is also getting into the AI training business. Its AI Solutions arm has headhunted some white-collar workers with PhDs for gigs, such as its Project Sandbox — though it ended contracts for that project early, Business Insider reported last month.
CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said on Uber's November earnings call that the company's expansion into AI training is part of its aim to become a broader ""platform for work.""

4,2025-12-04,"Unique pricing sensibilities means POCO isn't ready to launch its best phone in India — and that's a damn shame.

In Hardwired, AC Senior Editor Harish Jonnalagadda delves into all things hardware, including phones, audio products, storage servers, and networking gear.
I've been using the F8 Ultra for the last three weeks, and I like what POCO did with the phone. While the brand always did a great job with the hardware, it wasn't until the F7 Ultra that it was able to deliver a phone with a great camera, and the F8 Ultra builds on that foundation. In my F8 Ultra review, I called it one of the best phones in the $800 category, and I stand by that — it really is a great all-rounder.
There's just one problem: POCO isn't bringing the phone to India. At the launch of the F8 Pro and F8 Ultra, POCO indicated that it sold 94 million devices globally in its seven-year history, and that's pretty good. While the brand didn't go into regional figures, India is POCO's biggest market by a considerable amount; its presence in the country and positioning as an affordable brand has allowed it to make significant inroads.
It's this positioning that's hurting the brand now. I asked POCO India and global spokespeople for an on-the-record statement about why its latest device isn't coming to India, but I didn't get one. That said, it isn't hard to understand why POCO is reticent to launch the F8 Ultra in India; the brand is still seen as a budget player, and it just doesn't have the cachet to sell a phone that costs over $700 in the country — there wouldn't be any takers.
 



Xiaomi — POCO's parent brand — knows this well, as it has tried several times in the past to sell its costliest phones in the country to no avail. That's why we didn't get Mi-branded flagships for a while, and it's only in the last two years that it started selling its Ultra models in India. I see this as a prestige play, where Xiaomi is able to raise its brand profile by marketing devices like the Xiaomi 14 Ultra and Xiaomi 15 Ultra in the country, and this is similar to what OPPO and Vivo also do with the Find X9 Pro and X300 Pro.
With POCO, however, the focus is still on the budget category. This is why the brand didn't bring the F7 Ultra to the country earlier in the year, only debuting the budget-focused F7 instead. POCO positions its products at a younger audience, and that ostensibly means catering to the budget segment with devices in the C and M series. I'm positive that these entry-level and budget phones outsell even the likes of the X7 Pro, and in that context, it's easy to see why POCO didn't bring the F8 Ultra to India.
Even then, I think the brand should have taken a gamble this time around. Phone pricing is trending up in India — like all global markets — and this year's flagships highlight that. Vivo sub-brand iQOO's devices are positioned against POCO's products, and the iQOO 15 debuted in India for ₹72,999 ($811), a staggering increase of ₹18,000 ($200) from the iQOO 13's ₹54,999 ($611) pricing last year.
 



With a significant price increase this year and the likes of Realme and other brands also rolling out phones in this category, this would have been the ideal year for POCO to bring its costlier portfolio of products to the country. The F8 Ultra is positioned well against the iQOO 15 and Realme GT 8 Pro, and given POCO's recognition as a value-focused brand, it would have sold a decent number of phones by undercutting the F8 Ultra against its key rivals.

After all, it was this exact strategy that allowed POCO to rise in prominence with the F1 all those years ago. The F1 was an outlier in the sheer amount of value it delivered, and it's clear that we won't get devices like that again; the F2 Pro was proof of that. But to not bring the F8 Ultra to India feels like a short-sighted move, considering when other brands are willing to take a bet on the country.
If nothing else, this is hurting POCO's image in the country. I get that devices like the F8 Ultra won't sell in anywhere as many numbers as the brand's budget phones, but having marquee phones to market only elevates a brand's profile, and Samsung does this to great effect globally. It positions Galaxy S and Z devices as aspirational products, and sells millions of Galaxy A and FE devices with the clear implication that they're just as good as the flagships — POCO (and Xiaomi in general) doesn't seem to get this strategy.
The way Xiaomi and POCO position their brands in the U.K. is drastically different to India, and I find that puzzling considering both brands are actually recognizable in the country. POCO is doing all the right things when it comes to the actual hardware, and it now needs to get its strategy in order and ensure its best devices are sold in its biggest market.

Amazon kept pricing steady on select flagship products after Cyber Monday ended, and the Bose QuietComfort headphones remain discounted at what marks their lowest price point yet. These wireless noise-cancelling headphones now sell for $199 instead of the regular $349 tagÂ which brings premium Bose audio and industry-leading noise cancellation down to a price bracket where you’d typically find mid-tier alternatives with compromised performance.
See at Amazon
The QuietComfort headphones have microphones around each earcup that constantly pick up sounds from the outside world and they make sound waves that are opposite to the noise that is coming in, which cancels it out before it gets to your ears. This active noise cancellation works over a wide range of frequencies and gets rid of everything from the low rumble of airplane engines to the mid-frequency chatter of people talking in an office. The system changes in real time as your acoustic environment changes and for example, it automatically lowers the cancellation strength when you move from a quiet room to a busy street. The plush over-ear cushions block out noise passively by making a physical seal around your ears. This works with active cancellation to make the silence even deeper than either method alone.
When you need to concentrate or sleep while traveling, Quiet Mode turns on full noise cancellation for the best isolation, while Aware Mode lets outside sounds through the headphones so you can hear announcements, conversations, or traffic without taking them off. This mode of transparency uses the same outside microphones that cancel out noise. It picks up sounds from the outside world and mixes them in with your audio playback in a natural way and with the push of a button, you can switch between modes, which lets you quickly adapt to situations where being aware is important for safety or socializing.
High-fidelity audio drivers make sound clear across the whole frequency range, bringing out vocal and instrumental details that are lost on cheaper headphones. You can change the bass, midrange, and treble settings right in the Bose Music app. This lets you change the sound to fit your tastes or make up for different types of music. When you want cleaner mids in bass-heavy electronic music, lowering the low-end can help. On the other hand, adding treble to acoustic recordings can bring out string details.
With noise cancellation on, the battery can last up to 24 hours on a single charge which is enough for multi-day trips or full work weeks without needing to plug in. Plugging it in for just 15 minutes gives you 2.5 hours of playback time, which is great if you forgot to charge it overnight and need to leave right away. The included audio cable with an inline microphone lets you connect the headphones with a wire when Bluetooth isn’t available or when the battery dies in the middle of a flight.
With multipoint Bluetooth, you can connect to two devices at the same time and switch between them automatically based on which one plays audio first. You can stay connected to both your laptop and your phone at the same time, you can answer calls on your phone without having to disconnect from your computer or miss notifications while watching videos. The seamless switching between devices makes it easy to switch audio sources without having to go into Bluetooth settings every time.
The padded headband spreads the weight evenly across the top of your head, stopping the pressure points that form when you wear poorly made headphones for a long time. The over-ear cushions are made of memory foam wrapped in synthetic protein leather. This makes them feel soft against your skin and keeps their shape even after years of daily use and these headphones stay comfortable even on long flights across the ocean or during eight-hour work days.
The $199 price drop is $150 less than Bose’s top-of-the-line noise-canceling headphones, which puts them in competition with brands that can’t match their adaptive ANC, sound quality, and comfort all day long.

Cyber Monday ended three days ago, and Black Friday seems like a long time ago but Amazon still has this bundle at its lowest price ever: The Logitech G923 racing wheel with pedals and the separate shifter usually costs $459, but right now it’s only $333.
This is a great gift for people who love racing games or who are tired of playing Gran Turismo and Forza with a regular controller that doesn’t feel like real driving. The TrueForce force feedback system connects directly to game audio engines to make vibrations and resistance that match what’s happening on screen and it fixes the problem of not being able to feel what you’re seeing.
See at Amazon
The G923’s force feedback technology processes game sound up to 4000 times per second to make the wheel vibrate: You can feel the texture of different road surfaces, the rumble of engine vibrations, and the effect of hitting curbs or going off-track through steering resistance that changes all the time. This is different from older force feedback systems that only reacted to directional forces like crashes or understeer as they missed the small things that make driving feel like you’re in control of the car. The dual-motor system has enough torque to make it feel like you’re steering a heavy load when you’re going fast around a corner, but it still lets you turn smoothly when you’re going slowly.
The wheel can turn 900 degrees which is the same amount that real car steering does which means that you are turning the wheel the same amount that you would in a real car, not making big movements. The rim is wrapped in real leather for grip and durability that lasts through long marathon races and the hand-stitching gives it a high-end look that cheap rubber or synthetic materials can’t match. Steel paddle shifters behind the wheel make a satisfying click when you change gears. They are also in a place where your fingers naturally rest while racing. The steel shaft that runs through the center of the wheel hides the force feedback motors which makes a strong connection that sends feedback exactly without any dead zones or flex.
The pedal set has a progressive brake spring that makes it harder to push down on the brake pedal, just like real hydraulic brakes that need more pressure to stop faster. This progressive resistance makes it easier to control how hard you brake, which is very important when you want to brake as late as possible without locking the wheels. The throttle and clutch pedals have lighter springs to make them easier to use, and all three pedals have rubber faces with texture that keep your feet from slipping when you drive aggressively.
The separate shifter makes the experience go from good to great by giving you a real H-pattern with six speeds and reverse: You can put the shifter exactly where it feels right for you in relation to your wheel and seat because it mounts separately with a desk clamp or screws. The metal shaft and gear mechanism make mechanical clicks and resistance that feel good to use. The whole thing is strong enough to handle rough shifting during competitive racing.
You can use this with PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PC, and Mac so you don’t have to stick with one platform if you upgrade your hardware or switch between systems. The wheel connects to your computer or console through USB and gets its power from them and you don’t need any extra power supplies or complicated setup beyond putting it on your desk.
This $126 off the bundle is a big savings compared to buying the wheel and shifter separately, where you’d usually pay full price for each part. For less than the cost of the wheel alone at regular price, you get professional-grade sim racing hardware that real racers use in competitive leagues.

Amazon kept some Cyber Monday deals running on select items including this JBL Go 4 that punches way above its weight class in the sound department. The speaker is currently down to $39 from its regular $49 price, which is an all-time low that makes it an easy pick for personal use or as a holiday gift at a reasonable budget.
See at Amazon
The sound engineering that went into this small speaker is all about getting bass response that usually needs much bigger drivers and enclosures. JBL tuned the parts inside to make what they call “punchy bass” which means that you can feel the low-end frequencies instead of just hearing the tinny mids and highs. A single driver and passive radiators in the speaker boost the bass without needing extra power or space. This means you get fuller sound from something that weighs less than half a pound. The JBL Go 4 is great for times when you want to hear real music instead of the thin, high-pitched sound that most ultra-portable speakers make.
With moderate volumes, the battery lasts up to seven hours of continuous playbackÂ which is enough for most day trips or outdoor activities without having to find an outlet. The Playtime Boost feature adds two more hours by changing the audio processing to use less power. However, you will lose some volume and bass depth in exchange for longer battery life. This is helpful when you’re at the beach or camping and remember you forgot to charge it the night before and it gives you enough power to keep the music going until sunset.
The IP67 certification means that the speaker can stay submerged in up to one meter of water for 30 minutes and is also completely dustproof. After a day at the beach, you can rinse it off under the tap, use it in the shower, or leave it by the pool without worrying about splashes ruining the electronics. The tough outside is made of recycled plastic and has a fabric grille that protects the driver while letting sound through clearly. This environmentally friendly construction doesn’t make the speakers less durable; the materials can handle drops and bumps that would break less sturdy speakers.
With the $10 off, this speaker is now cheap enough that you might buy it on a whim instead of thinking about it first. For less than the price of good wired headphones, you get IP67 protection, surprisingly strong bass, and a battery that lasts all day. JBL built their name on providing high-quality sound at reasonable prices. This is the lowest price ever for a portable speaker that doesn’t sound like a toy and it’s easy to grab one and try it out for yourself.

Sony extended several deals beyond Black Friday and Cyber Monday, covering products like the PS5 Pro, controllers, PS VR2, and the PlayStation Portal. The PS Portal is currently sitting at a record low of $178 instead of the usual $199 on Amazon which makes it a lot more accessible for people who want to play their PS5 games away from the TV.
This device solves the problem of shared screen time in households where multiple people want to use the same television and lets you stream your PS5 library to the handheld anywhere in your home with decent Wi-Fi. The 8-inch LCD screen and DualSense controller integration mean you’re getting the full PS5 experience in a portable form factor.
See at Amazon
The PlayStation Portal streams games directly from your PS5 console over your home Wi-Fi network. To work well, it needs at least 5Mbps of bandwidth, but Sony says 15Mbps is better. To send video to the Portal’s screen, your PS5 needs to be either fully on or in Rest Mode with network features turned on. The console does all the processing and with this method, you can play the real PS5 versions of games with the best graphics and performance, as long as your streaming connection is good enough. The system works with any game that is compatible with your console including both PS5 and PS4 games that you already own.
Cloud streaming is available to PlayStation Plus Premium members which means you can play hundreds of games from the catalog directly on the Portal without having to download them. This makes it possible to play games when you’re not at home or when someone else is using the console, but you need a stable internet connection no matter where you are. With a Premium subscription, you can also stream some digital PS5 games from the cloud which means you can play them right away without having to wait for installations or updates to finish.
The 8-inch LCD screen can show 1080p resolution at up to 60 frames per secondÂ which is the highest frame rate that most PS5 games can handle. This means that action games and competitive shooters will run smoothly. The display brightness works well in well-lit rooms without washing out, and the full HD clarity makes game details clear enough that you won’t feel like you’re losing visual quality compared to playing on your TV. The screen is in the middle of two halves of what is basically a DualSense controller that has been split in half. You get the same haptic feedback and adaptive triggers that you would get when playing normally on the console.
You can use Tempest 3D AudioTech with any audio device that works with PlayStation Link wireless technology or a standard 3.5mm headphone jack: This spatial audio processing makes the same immersive soundscapes that you’d hear on your main setup. This helps you find enemies in competitive games or enjoy the details of the environment in single-player adventures.
The PlayStation Portal has all the DualSense features that make PS5 games feel different from games on other platforms. For example, it has haptic feedback that changes based on what you do in the game and adaptive triggers that give you different levels of resistance. The controller vibrations let you feel the tension of drawing a bow, the recoil of different weapons, or the texture of the ground and it keeps you connected to the game even though you’re playing on a smaller screen. The button layout, thumbstick placement, and overall ergonomics are the same as those of a standard DualSense controller, so you won’t have to learn new controls or get used to a cramped handheld layout.
This $21 discount makes the PlayStation Portal cheaper than standalone gaming handhelds that can’t access your existing PS5 library which makes it a good choice. You’re getting a device that lets you keep your game saves going smoothly between the TV and the handheld without having to deal with multiple versions or problems with cloud save synchronization.

As we soar right toward the end of the year, all our Instagram and Twitter feeds are now expectedly inundated with Spotify Wrapped. The music streaming platform’s end-of-year personal summaries always make for a fun time of defending you’re quirky top 5s or lying that, “I only really use Spotify when my kids are in the car. IÂ definitely didn’t listen to 5,247 minutes of ‘This Is What It Sounds Like’ fromÂ K-Pop Demon HuntersÂ on my own!” It’s okay. Me too, buddy.
Part of Spotify Wrapped is the platform automatically makes a playlist for you of your top listened-to songs of the year. So why not give your faves, your absolute bangers, your cream of the crop the justice they deserve by blasting your songs over a brand new JBL Flip 7 Bluetooth speaker? Amazon actually has the portable speaker on sale at the moment for 27% off. The JBL speaker normally goes for $150, but the discount takes $40 off the top, leaving you only having to pay an easy $110 for a limited time.
See at Amazon
The JBL Flip 7 features a two-way speaker system that delivers stunning sound with impressive bass. The woofer handles deep lows and midrange frequencies, while the tweeter produces crisp, high-end notesâcombining for a rich, dynamic audio experience that you can both hear and feel. The long-lasting battery provides up to 16 hours of playback on a single charge, so youâll have plenty of time to enjoy your music, all day or nearly all of it.
Take your music anywhere with the portable JBL Flip 7. Itâs designed for on-the-go use, including both a loop and carabiner. The speaker has an IP67 rating for waterproof and dustproof protection. So it doesn’t matter whether youâre by the pool or at the beach, you can enjoy your tunes in almost any environment. Its durable fabric and rubber exterior are built to withstand rough conditions and minor impacts.





The JBL Flip 7 comes in a variety of colors to suit your personality. Choose from vibrant shades like red, blue, green, pink, or opt for the camo version. Just be careful not to set it down in the grass. If you prefer a more subtle look, there are also sleek sand, white, and black options available.

10,2025-12-04,"As the large language models powering generative AI tools slurp up ever more data across the web, Cloudflare cofounder and CEO Matthew Prince said at WIRED’s Big Interview event in San Francisco on Thursday that the internet infrastructure company has blocked more than 400 billion AI bot requests for its customers since July 1.
The action comes after the company announced a Content Independence Day in July—an initiative with prominent publishers and AI firms to block AI crawlers by default on content creators’ work unless the AI companies pay for access. Since July 2024, Cloudflare has offered customers tools to block AI bots from scraping their content. Cloudflare told WIRED that the number of AI bots blocked since July 1, 2025 is 416 billion.
“The business model of the internet has always been to generate content that drives traffic [to a website] and then sell either things, subscriptions, or ads,” Prince told WIRED’s executive editor, Brian Barrett. “What I think people don't realize, though, is that AI is a platform shift. The business model of the internet is about to change dramatically. I don't know what it's going to change to, but it's what I'm spending almost every waking hour thinking about.”
As a company, Cloudflare’s offerings are geared toward making it faster and safer to access content online. But as the AI industry has exploded and AI giants have emerged, Prince says he’s become increasingly focused on how Cloudflare can leverage its position to discourage consolidation and safeguard the internet as a place where businesses and creators of every size can survive—or, ideally, thrive.
“We need to be able to make sure that businesses large and small flourish on a fair playing ground,” Prince said. “That is the future that we're trying to play for. That's the best thing for our business, because that's more people to be customers of ours. That's more internet for us to be able to protect.”
Prince specifically highlighted concerns about Google’s policies around its search and AI crawlers. As a major AI player jostling for dominance, Google combined its search and AI crawlers into one, so blocking its AI scraper also blocks a site’s ability to be indexed in Google search. The move has put content creators in a bind, because they don’t want AI models to train on their creations, but they typically need their place in Google search to help audiences find their material.
“You can't opt out of one without opting out of both, which is a real challenge—it's crazy,” Prince said. “It shouldn't be that you can use your monopoly position of yesterday in order to leverage and have a monopoly position in the market of tomorrow.”
Prince cites stats that Cloudflare has not previously shared publicly about how much more of the internet Google can see compared to other companies like OpenAI and Anthropic or even Meta and Microsoft. Prince says Cloudflare found that Google currently sees 3.2 times more pages on the internet than OpenAI, 4.6 times more than Microsoft, and 4.8 times more than Anthropic or Meta does. Put simply, “they have this incredibly privileged access,” Prince says.
Publishers and other content creators have seen promising results when they block AI crawlers, Prince adds. He argues that creative, original human thought still has immense potential value and urgency for AI companies looking to ever-expand their models, whether these insights come from local news outlets that know all the regional details or Reddit users brain-dumping their deepest—or silliest—ideas. And this creates the potential for licensing deals and other paid content to be at least the germ of a viable business model for creators long-term.
Ultimately, Prince notes, regulation may be a necessary intervention. In the meantime, Cloudflare is working to apply pressure wherever it can to drive evolution of AI business models that are pluralistic and expand markets, rather than concentrating and centralizing them. Prince argues that while this aligns with the founding tenets of the open internet, it’s also just good business for everyone.
“It's almost like a Marvel movie—the hero of the last film becomes the villain of the next one,” he said. “Google is the problem here. It is the company that is keeping us from going forward on the internet, and until we force them—or hopefully convince them—that they should play by the same rules as everyone else and split their crawlers up between search and AI, I think we're going to have a hard time completely locking all the content down.”

With Black Friday and Cyber Monday having passed, you might be thinking times up for finding great deals on tech and gaming stuff. But oh, my friend, you could not be more wrong. Amazon still has a number of deals still active following the huge savings weekend. For instance, this Razer Tartarus V2 gaming keypad went on sale just before Black Friday to its lowest price on record and has remained since. The gaming keypad usually goes for $80, so that 25% ends up chopping off $20âbringing the price you pay to only $60. No telling when the price will jump back up, so if you’re still shopping for the right gift for your gamer pal or are just looking to upgrade your own gaming setup, now’s the time to do it.
Let’s chat about mice, keyboard and controller for a moment. For some genres, the best way to play is obvious. A real-time strategy game? That’s gotta be mouse and keyboard. Racing games? Need to go with controller for those analog triggers. Though, some genres are debatableâparticularly the first-person shooter.
See at Amazon
With a mouse, you have pin-point control over your aim, able to accelerate naturally, as fast as you can move the mouse. And yet, movement is limited. the W, A, S, D, control scheme doesn’t allow for precise control over your walking speed. Plus you’re limited to exactly eight directions of movement.
On controller, you can decide how fast you move, and have a full 360-degree range of movement with the left analog stick. However, your view relies on the right analog stick, which can only turn so fast and offers a much more limited control.
Hannah Montanna knew best. You need the best of both worldsâand the Razer Tartarus V2 is just that.
The Tartarus looks like someone hacked up a keyboard and glued a joy-stick to the side (complimentary). With it, you now have a directional thumbpad for more natural controls, closer to what console-oriented players are used to. And then your remaining four fingers can still have access to all the keys you need. There’s also a scroll wheel.
The Razer Tartarus V2 features 32 mecha-membrane keys. They provide the tactile feedback and satisfaction of pressing down a mechanical key. They are are individually programmable so you can set it however you like to support your gaming or for use in creative workflows such as video or photo editing. You can even program macros, allowing for multiple key and keypress combinations in order to execute complex commands.
The gaming keypad is built with an ergonomic palm rest which is both adjustable and detachable, so you can customize your set up to whatever best matches your preferences and comfort.
And it of course would not be a proper Gamer with a capital G accessory without proper RGB lighting. The Razer Tartarus V2 gaming keypad offers full Razer Chroma supports. You can have the keypad fully synchronize with the game you’re playing or even with your Philips Hue lights if you’d got them.

Kalshi is ramping up its media partnerships with a new CNBC deal.
The popular prediction site has a new multi-year partnership with the business news giant that will put Kalshi's real-time prediction data across CNBC's channel, site, and app, starting in 2026.
Kalshi reached a similar data integration deal with CNN on Tuesday. That day, Kalshi also announced that it had raised $1 billion from investors at an $11 billion valuation.
The terms of the two partnerships weren't disclosed, but a person familiar with the deals said that money is changing hands in both. Axios reported that Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour said CNN isn't paying to license Kalshi's data. Kalshi disputed that Mansour said that to Axios.
Prediction markets like Kalshi and rival Polymarket let users trade contracts about the outcomes of events — from elections to sports games, or even whether it will rain in a city before a certain date.
CNBC viewers will be able to see what Kalshi users believe are the probabilities of different market and economic outcomes, such as whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its next meeting, based on the way those users are trading contracts. The financial news outlet will also feature a Kalshi-branded ticker during select TV segments on shows such as ""Squawk Box"" and ""Fast Money."" Kalshi will have a CNBC-branded page on its website.
Mansour said in a statement that the CNBC partnership is ""the next evolution: moving from data about what's happening now, to real-time forecasts about what's happening next.""
CNBC President KC Sullivan said in a statement that ""prediction markets are rapidly shaping how investors and business leaders think about important events.""
""Kalshi's data will serve as a powerful complement to CNBC's reporting and help people stay better informed about the world around them,"" he added.
Real-time markets data — like stock prices — have been a staple of CNBC for decades. The business news network is now turning to predictions data to help keep users engaged.
News organizations like CNBC could see engagement rise if viewers and readers connect to prediction data as way to gamify news. Prediction sites ""can be highly engaging"" since they can ""create a feeling of being connected to real events as they unfold,"" said Daniel Umfleet, the CEO of telehealth service Kindbridge Behavioral Health, which works with gamblers.
Prediction sites could also turn into a new revenue stream for media companies, similar to how sports betting ads are now ubiquitous across sports networks and podcasts.
Kalshi isn't the only prediction site striking deals. Rival Polymarket reached a prediction data integration deal with Yahoo Finance in mid-November, and earlier this year became the official prediction market service for X, formerly known as Twitter. Polymarket and Kalshi also reached prediction data deals with Google in November.
Partnerships with major news organizations are beneficial for Kalshi since they're ""a form of brand building,"" Morningstar gaming analyst Dan Wasiolek told Business Insider.
Prediction sites are increasingly popular. Kalshi announced in early December that its trading volume had risen eightfold since July.
Prediction markets have also drawn controversy, particularly around their similarities to gambling.
Kalshi and Polymarket are similar to online sportsbooks in the sense that they allow users to profit from predictions on the outcomes of events like games. However, they are classified as exchange markets for futures contracts that are regulated by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Instead of setting odds, these prediction markets price contracts and facilitate trades between their users.
Since Kalshi and Polymarket aren't sportsbooks, the platforms argue that they shouldn't be regulated at the state level. That said, some state regulators have targeted them.
In late November, a US District Court judge in Nevada ruled against Kalshi, saying ""Kalshi is not licensed to conduct gaming in Nevada or any other state"" and that the company was trying to ""evade state regulation."" Kalshi disputed this characterization and has appealed the ruling.
On Wednesday, the gaming division of Connecticut's Department of Consumer Protection issued a cease and desist order for Kalshi and investment platforms Robinhood and Crypto.com, calling their prediction markets ""unlicensed online gambling"" and saying they were ""operating outside a regulatory environment.""
""As other courts have recognized, Kalshi is a regulated, nationwide exchange for real-world events, and it is subject to exclusive federal jurisdiction,"" Kalshi said in a statement. ""It's very different from what state-regulated sportsbooks and casinos offer their customers. We are confident in our legal arguments and have filed suit in federal court.""
A class action lawsuit filed late last month similarly claimed Kalshi had violated state gambling laws. Kalshi disputes the claim. The case is ongoing.
If similar legal cases continue, the Supreme Court may eventually have to rule whether prediction markets like Kalshi should be legal in all 50 states.
Sportsbooks like FanDuel and DraftKings have responded to the success of Kalshi and Polymarket by announcing plans to launch their own competing prediction sites. Robinhood is also extending its prediction markets, which it said last week were its fastest-growing product line by revenue.
The prediction market landscape is ""even more 'Wild West' than sports betting"" because of the lack of clarity around regulation, said Rachel Volberg, a gambling researcher and professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
Morningstar's Wasiolek said he thought prediction markets would have a positive impact on sportsbooks, and that they would ""expand the market more than cannibalize it."" But he added that the sportsbooks' shift into prediction markets could raise their costs in what's ""an increasingly uncertain and competitive landscape.""

If you're among the many Americans who lament that the pandemic housing boom passed you by, 2026 might finally be your moment.
A new Redfin report predicts that next year will usher in what the company calls ""The Great Housing Reset."" Researchers expect a multi-year stretch of slowly rising home sales and improved affordability, as incomes outpace home prices for the first sustained period since the Great Recession.
Redfin forecasts that mortgage rates will gradually decline over the course of 2026 and that, by year's end, the median home-sale price will be up just 1% from a year earlier. Existing-home sales — the sale of previously owned homes — are expected to climb 3% from 2025, reaching an annualized pace of 4.2 million.
Daryl Fairweather, Redfin's chief economist, told Business Insider that home sales will pick up as the ""rate-lock"" effect fades and more homeowners with low mortgage rates finally decide to sell.
""A lot of people bought during the pandemic; there was just a huge surge of activity because of how low rates were,"" Fairweather said. ""A typical homebuyer stays in their home for 10 years, and we're five years out from the start of the pandemic. Naturally, we'll start to see more people be ready to sell homes again — it's not going to be a drastic change; it'll just be more of a loosening of the market.""
Over the last few years, the housing market has been strained. It all stems from the COVID-19 pandemic and its ripple effects on the real estate market.
In the early stages of the pandemic, the US government rolled out a massive stimulus package to prop up the economy. That, combined with rock-bottom mortgage rates, inadvertently set off one of the most dramatic homebuying frenzies in US history. Between late 2020 and 2021, a surge in demand drove home prices to record highs, exacerbating the nation's long-standing housing shortage.
Those pandemic-era dynamics have shaped the market ever since.
Homeownership has felt out of reach for years for many would-be buyers, especially millennials and Gen Zers who have watched mortgage rates climb (and since fall, but not to pandemic lows), starter homes vanish, newly built homes shrink, and the amount of cash needed to buy skyrocket.
By late 2025, though, there are signs the market is easing up. In many cities — even once-red-hot pandemic boomtowns like Austin and Tampa — softer demand has meant homes sit on the market longer, pushing sellers to cut prices and offer more incentives and concessions as buyers regain leverage.
Redfin expects that dynamic, along with gradually declining mortgage rates, to lure more would-be buyers back into the market. Still, researchers warn that even as conditions improve, affordability will remain a major barrier to homeownership for many, especially younger buyers.
""We're not going to see this wave of people rushing into the market again; we'll see more of a normalization — more of a return to what the housing market felt like pre-pandemic,"" Fairweather said. ""It's still going to be more expensive, but wages have increased considerably since 2018 and 2019, so I think more people will feel like, for their own personal circumstances, it's finally the right time to buy.""

Recently, I spent a week in the hospital, and my arms were covered in bruises and scratches from constant IVs and bloodwork.

This oil has truly been a lifesaver for my skin. Highly recommend!!"" —Michele D

I love the tingly minty feeling. If you don’t like tea tree oil, you might not like this product. But I love it. The smell is so refreshing and soothing. I’ve been using this for a couple of weeks now, so I can’t comment on hair growth yet, but my scalp feels SO much better. It used to feel raw and irritated, and now it feels normal again... Also, I have noticed SIGNIFICANTLY less hair fall in the shower. It used to be all over my bathroom sink when I would brush my hair. Now I have just a normal amount of hair fall."" —Jg22

Promising review: ""I like it a lot. Strangely, it does make me want to floss my teeth every day (which I don’t do). Maybe because it works! The day before I got these, I nearly destroyed my gums because I couldn’t get the piece of steak meat stuck between my back teeth. I could still feel it, but couldn’t see it. Then I bought these (only because they were on sale) and tried them; it worked in one go! I knew there was still something between my teeth! I even forgot about it because of the number of times my old floss couldn’t get anything out. Try the mini packs for yourself and you’ll see what I mean! No more wax floss for me.

""These are hands down my favorite hydrocolloid patches for pimples. While they all essentially do the same thing (reduce the appearance of pimples), these have won me over! I’m not sure if it’s the great price point combined with the number of patches, the cute designs to select from, or the compact case, but these are a winner. I also have to say that you don’t even feel these on your face, which makes me love them even more. While patches are small and meant to be somewhat inconspicuous, I’ve felt that other patches can feel “bulky” on my face and have even fallen off when I’m sleeping. These are truly thin to the point where I went to wash my face this morning and forgot that they were on my face."" —mklsg

""Worked QUICKLY! I was skeptical at first because a lot of the reviews I read were for people postpartum, and I just had a plain old-fashioned hemorrhoid (can’t be TMI if you’re here for a similar reason 😉).

I live in north Texas, where tree-related allergies can get bad, and not wanting to rely on allergy medicine or allergy shots, I do feel that this has made a difference for me and my family’s health. The dust doesn’t cling to the fabric outer sleeve like other air purifiers I’ve had in the past, either which I appreciate aesthetically."" —Emily
Price: $194.99 (originally $229.99)
Promising review: ""I never write reviews, but for this… I had to. I have been using this product for the last four months, about three times a week. I am typically prone to styes, but I haven’t gotten one since I started using these! Not only is it helping prevent styes, but my eyelids feel better and cleaner after using it. This product is life-changing for me. It’s easy to use and the value is worth every penny."" —Elisa

This year has seen the most layoffs in the US since the pandemic, according to the consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.
Employers have announced 1.17 million job cuts through November, a report published on Thursday showed.
It's just the sixth time since 1993 that this figure has exceeded 1.1 million.
2025 has seen the fifth-highest number of job cuts. The most were seen in 2020, when the labor market was upended by the COVID-19 pandemic. That year also marks the only time there were more than 2 million job cuts through November.
The majority of 2025's cuts came early in the year, with over 600,000 shed by the end of April, and 275,000 roles being eliminated in March alone as the Trump administration took the ax to government jobs in Washington, DC. 
Away from 2025, the other worst years for job cuts in the past three decades were 2001 and 2002 — around the dot-com crash — and 2009, when the financial crisis led to mass layoffs.
The report found US employers announced 71,321 job cuts in November, up 24% from the same period last year, though down more than half from the 153,074 cuts announced in October 2025.
""Job cuts in November have risen above 70,000 only twice since 2008: in 2022 and in 2008,"" said Andy Challenger, chief revenue officer for Challenger, Gray & Christmas.
The firm said that telecommunications companies cut the most jobs last month, at over 15,000, followed by some 12,000 layoffs in tech.
Verizon announced in November that it plans to lay off 13,000 employees.
Challenger's report said restructuring and economic conditions were the most commonly cited reasons for layoffs last month.
However, the leading cause through the year remains the Department of Government Efficiency, cited in nearly 300,000 job cuts.
So far this year, AI has been cited as responsible for around 55,000 layoffs, the report said.
Meanwhile, hiring is also stuttering.
Employers have announced just shy of 500,000 planned hires through November this year, the report found. That's down 35% from the same period last year and is the lowest year-to-date total since 2010.
""The increased spending over the Black Friday and the Thanksgiving weekend may give rise to hires in December right before the holiday,"" said Challenger, the company executive. ""It's unclear, however, if those positions will last into the New Year.""

21,2025-12-04,"The iPhone 17 series has been a massive success for Apple, with a recent report showing the iPhone 17 models will not only drive record revenue for Apple this quarter but also help improve global sales for 2025 compared to previous estimates. BGR has been tracking Apple stock availability since the launch, and three of the four models have consistently been sold out, especially the base iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro Max. The iPhone Air is the only 2025 iPhone not to see a similar reception. The phone has been available online since launch in the various markets we've been tracking. Only China experienced a brief stock disruption for the iPhone Air.
While the Air doesn't have the same appeal as the other three models, fans of the ultra-slim handset who didn't buy an iPhone Air will be happy to hear that you might find an unexpected bargain this holiday season, as long as you don't mind buying a slightly used model or a new handset from the used market. That seems to be the conclusion from a recent SellCell report. The smartphone trade-in experts, whose job is to track prices of used devices, have checked with more than 40 U.S. buyback companies, finding that the iPhone Air experienced the worst resale drop of any iPhone since 2022. The handset lost up to 47.7% of its value in 10 weeks. The figure applies to the 1TB iPhone Air, which costs $1,399 if you buy it from Apple. The iPhone Air's average depreciation sits at 44.3%, which suggests you can get good discounts if you don't mind buying a used iPhone Air unit.
To score savings of up to 40% on the iPhone Air, you'd have to look for unused or second-hand units sold on third-party websites, including auction sites like eBay. The downside is that you may have to buy the phone from an untrusted source if purchasing it from an individual rather than a company. The upside is getting a phone that's been used for less than three months at a great discount. Apple has not discounted the iPhone Air in its stores.
SellCell's data doesn't guarantee the savings but signals that iPhone Air owners are willing to sell the handset at much lower values than expected for a new iPhone. SellCell noted in its report that the iPhone Air's depreciation is 12.4% worse than the iPhone 15, 7.7% worse than the iPhone 14, and 5.3% worse than the iPhone 16.
The iPhone 17 series saw an average depreciation of 34.6% after 10 weeks, according to SellCell's research. The resale value is in line with expectations for the first 10-week period, but it outperforms previous generations. The iPhone 16 series and the iPhone 14 series depreciated by 39% and 36.6% during their first 10 weeks of sales, respectively. The iPhone 17 models retained 9.7% more value than the iPhone Air. The best-performing iPhone 17 variant is the 256GB iPhone 17 Pro Max, at 26.1% depreciation. Put differently, an iPhone 17 model is a better investment than the iPhone Air if you plan on trading the phone in at some point in the future. SellCell's data also suggests that buying an iPhone 17 variant from the used market would be cheaper than getting it from Apple and its partners, assuming there's enough stock from unofficial retailers."

Director Carl Eric Rinsch made so many failed, seven-figure option bets after Netflix wired him $11 million that his broker at Wells Fargo tried — and failed — to stop him, a New York fraud jury heard on Tuesday.
""I can afford to lose the money,"" Rinsch said, according to testimony by his former Wells Fargo advisor, Ronald See.
And when the brokerage hit the brakes — limiting him to $250,000 per transaction — the show developer was undaunted.
On March 30, 2019, just three weeks after receiving the $11 million, Rinsch instructed See, of Wells Fargo Advisors, to wire his remaining $8.5 million to Citibank so he could establish a new brokerage account with Charles Schwab.
""They won't put restrictions on me there,"" Rinsch wrote See in a letter shown to jurors.
Rinsch, 48, is on trial in federal court in Manhattan, fighting charges that he had no right to use the $11 million Netflix sent him on anything other than ""White Horse,"" the 120-minute TV series he'd already spent $44 million of Netflix's money on. (Rinsch ultimately never finished a single episode of the clones-versus-humans sci-fi thriller.)
Defense lawyers counter that the $11 million was actually Rinsch's contractually-promised payment for having completed principal photography, and was his money to spend as he pleased.
Either way, testimony on Tuesday by two of Rinsch's former financial advisors showed that he was eager to spend the cash prosecutors say the director had quickly moved into his Wells Fargo account.
The streamer wired Rinsch the $11 million on March 6, 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic halted film production worldwide.
Over the next three weeks, he then lost some $5.8 million, almost all of it on highly risky options trades involving Gilead Sciences, which was developing COVID-19 treatment drugs. (See would earn a $22,000 fee on these losses, the defense pointed out on cross-examination.)
The director was off to the races again as soon as he switched to Charles Schwab, according to testimony.
""I could send $3 mm personal to get started,"" he wrote to his new financial advisor, Adam Checchi, who also testified on Tuesday.
""I understood that to mean three million from his personal funds,"" Checchi said under questioning by a federal prosecutor.
Checchi told jurors that Rinsch would soon lose almost $6 million more, mostly on failed, highly risky bets that Gilead's stock would rise and that the S&P 500 would decline.
""I'm not a broad, diversify kind of guy,"" Rinsch explained in a late March 2020 email, adding that he pursues ""aggressive"" option trading ""fully expecting to lose it all.""
Earlier in the day, former Netflix executive Peter Friedlander, who on Monday called Rinch's project ""visionary,"" completed a second day of testimony.
Defense attorney Benjamin Zeman showed Friedlander — and the jury — emails from August 2019, in which Rinsch begged for ""immediate support"" with casting in Brazil.
""Show is set to collapse,"" Rinsch wrote.
The defense is blaming the implosion of White Horse on Netflix's decision to pull support for the project in September 2020.
Using an email chain projected throughout the courtroom on Tuesday, Zeman attempted to show jurors that a year earlier, Friedlander was already cold toward the show developer's requests for help.
""His own delays in decisions have caused this,"" Friedlander wrote in forwarding Rinsch's email to Mike Posey, an original series vice president, and others, including production executive Shelley Stevens and Rahul Bansal, an original series director.
Rinsch would continue asking for support — and money — for another six months before Netflix forwarded the $11 million payment at the center of the trial. The project was ultimately written off by Netflix as a tax loss eight months later, in November 2020.
Rinsch's trial is expected to continue through next week. He faces up to 90 years in prison if convicted of wire fraud, money laundering, and engaging in unlawful monetary transactions.

25,2025-12-04,"Wi-Fi! It’s everywhere, and yet you can’t really see it, by virtue of the technology relying on the transmission of electromagnetic waves outside the visual spectrum. Never mind, though, because you can always build yourself a Wi-Fi analyzer to get some insight into your radio surroundings, as demonstrated by [moononournation].
The core of the build is the ESP32-C5. The popular microcontroller is well-equipped for this task with its onboard dual-band Wi-Fi hardware, even if the stock antenna on most devboards is a little underwhelming. [moononournation] has paired this with a small rectangular LCD screen running the ILI9341 controller. The graphical interface is drawn with the aid of the Arduino_GFX library. It shows a graph of access points detected in the immediate area, as well as which channels they’re using and their apparent signal strength.
If you’re just trying to get a basic read on the Wi-Fi environment in a given locale, a tool like this can prove pretty useful. If your desires are more advanced, you might leap up to tinkering in the world of software defined radio. Video after the break.


the functionality of this project has been a perfectly fine smartphone app for more than a decade :)
“… and yet you can’t really see it, by virtue of the technology relying on the transmission of electromagnetic waves outside the visual spectrum.”
Sounds like an engineering challenge to me.  :)
Already got infrared/thermal perception wired up to myself daily for the last year or so and was looking into exactly this sort of wifi scanning setup to use as a new source of input to the mind.  Maybe not visual sight, but certainly a sense.
These newer dual band boards allow lots of useful maker projects!
With some tweaks this may be one to add to the sensory repertoire while at work for quicker diagnostics of network/airspace issues I often run up against.  Hmmmm….

A whole host of AI startups are emerging to help marketers create ads to acquire new customers. Tel Aviv-based Eikona is using AI to help marketers retain those customers, an area often referred to as ""lifecycle marketing.""
On Thursday, Eikona announced a $5 million seed investment round, led by StageOne Ventures. Crecendo Venture Partners, Wix Ventures, and Clarim Ventures also participated.
Eikona adds a generative AI layer to the practice of A/B testing, which is when marketers compare different versions of an email, SMS, or app push notification to figure out which one yields the best results.
Eikona has developed its own AI models that generate content from scratch and create different variations based on their performance. It built its own models on top of various existing popular AI models. Marketers can plug in their brand guidelines and past performance data to help Eikona fine-tune its models to personalize content to different users.
Nir Weingarten, Eikona's cofounder and CEO, told Business Insider that A/B testing can often be hard to scale. And while some marketers are beginning to use AI to help create their marketing content and ads, the prompts they use can sometimes be limited and grounded in their own human biases.
""It's hard to understand what worked — is it because the background was red, or was it a composition of things? This is something AI is good at: combining features,"" Weingarten said.
Eikona integrates into marketers' existing automation platforms. Asked what could stop a platform like Klaviyo, Braze, or Iterable from producing Eikona-like features themselves, Weingarten said his company's advantage as a startup is that it can move quickly.
""This is the classic innovator's dilemma,"" Weingarten said.""Hopefully, we can get to distribution before the giants get to the innovation.""
Weingarten said the company plans to invest the fresh funds in further product development.
""We spent our first two to three years devoted to finding product-market fit,"" Weingarten said. ""We have the notion, we've validated, we understand the ability to create a lot of profit for users, and now we need to make this a product that people like to use.""
In five years, Weingarten hopes Eikona will become a market leader in a new category he describes as ""adaptive marketing.""
""We want it to be a standard in the world, starting in lifecycle marketing, where every message that reaches a client is adapted in a certain way to be much more intimate, more personal, much more warm, and much better performing,"" Weingarten said.

""What's your age?"" isn't typically a fair question, but Spotify's making it OK.
Spotify Wrapped is back, and the big, new feature for the streamer's year-end recap for users is the ""listening age."" While some weren't too exciting — my listening age (34) wasn't far off from my real one (36) — others had a different experience, like newsletter editor Grace Lett, 28, whose listening age was 51.
Grace took the news in stride, but others weren't so happy, writes BI's Katie Notopoulos.
The whole thing might seem like a silly gimmick (it is), but it's also the perfect representation of Spotify Wrapped: a smart marketing tool to get people talking about their Spotify use with each other.
There's also a method to the madness. Wrapped isn't just about doing a quick search of users' top artists and songs. (Justice and ""Hate"" by ThxSoMch for me, since I know you were dying to know.)
Wrapped takes the entire year, with work for next year's edition beginning as soon as the current year's drops. Executives analyze reactions on social media and figure out how to adjust going forward. Three Spotify executives walked BI's Henry Chandonnet through the whole process.
Spotify Wrapped isn't easily replicable.
Like most popular things, plenty of companies have tried recreating Spotify's success. That includes rival YouTube, which launched YouTube Recap this year.
But few, if any, have penetrated the zeitgeist quite like Spotify.
Some platforms don't deserve a recap. I'd be depressed if I saw how much I spent on takeout this year or the number of hours I logged playing video games.
Others come off as too braggadocious. I would rather gouge out my eyes than see a recap of your Strava or Peloton history.
Music is a sweet spot, though. It's fun to look back at what you listened to throughout the year, kind of like catching up with an old friend. And there's a genuine interest in how others' lists stack up. (It's always fun finding an undercover Swiftie or a lowkey Deadhead.)
One group still seemed unimpressed on Spotify's big day: investors. Spotify's stock finished down almost 3.5%.
And isn't it ironic? Don't you think?

The ability to forecast the future is a valuable sign of intelligence and a good test of AI's capabilities. How good is ChatGPT at prediction?
An answer to this fascinating question emerged recently when economist David Seif wrapped up an annual forecasting contest he runs for a secret group of economists, hedge fund investors, and tech executives.
In its seventh year, the challenge requires contestants to predict roughly 30 events. The 2025 game kicked off in late 2024, when Seif sent out the list of events to predict in fields such as politics, business, science, economics, pop culture, and sports.
One question asked the contestants to forecast whether Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce would announce their engagement by April 1. Another: Would Bulgaria adopt the euro as its official currency on or before July 1?
Sam Leffell, a director at a hedge fund firm, was filling out his probabilities in December and had an idea.
""When I was answering the questions, I had the ChatGPT screen up. I wondered, what it will say to these questions?"" he recalled in a recent interview.
Leffell reached out to Seif to ask if ChatGPT could take part, and Seif said, go for it. So, Leffell got started by pasting the game's rules into ChatGPT.
These are complex rules, covering multiple pages. Contestants must assign a percentage based on the likelihood of each event happening. As the results come in over the year, these predictions are scored a bit like golf. The lowest score wins.
""You get points equal to the square of the difference between what you put and the results,"" Seif said.
For example, if you assign a 90% chance of something happening and you get it right, you get 10 points. That number is squared, resulting in a total of 100 points. Excellent work.
The opposite is more painful. If your 90% probability event doesn't occur, you are stuck with the difference between 90 and zero. That 90 score is then squared for a total of 8,100 points. Ouch.
And this is only the scoring system. There are whole pages of rules on other aspects of the game. Leffell pasted all this into ChatGPT.
A few seconds later, the AI chatbot responded, ""Thank you for providing the detailed rules of the forecasting contest. Please share the clean list of prompts for which you need a probability estimate, and I will provide a single number for each as per the contest's guidelines.""
Leffell pasted in all 30 questions at once, and ChatGPT quickly replied with its percentage probabilities for each event. Leffell sent those to Seif, who entered the responses on ChatGPT's behalf.
Even while setting this machine-prediction experiment up, Leffell noticed something intriguing.
""For one question, related to an NFL wild card outcome, it gave a mathematical response that was statistically correct,"" he said. ""It was doing math rather than qualitative stuff. That was notable because ChatGPT, at the time, was not supposed to be good at math.""
As 2025 began, 160 contestants had submitted their predictions and began waiting for the future to unfurl.
This is when I first heard about the game through friends of mine who were participating. One is a hedge fund manager. The other two are a chief marketing officer and a lawyer.
They became insufferable at parties, discussing their various forecasts, along with the intricacies of the scoring system and other rules.
It's the type of conversation that bores me to death. However, when one friend mentioned that ChatGPT was taking part for the first time, I got hooked.
Could a machine outperform 160 humans in predicting all these events? AI models are great when there's existing data. When the future's involved, there's a lot less information to lean on.
I'd recently tested ChatGPT's stock market forecasting ability. Could it excel at this more complex challenge, or are humans uniquely adept at foreseeing the future through experience, extrapolation, and intuition?
As the year progressed, some events occurred, and others didn't. Some happened too late, while others developed in weird, unexpected ways. As life does.
Each time a question was resolved, Seif updated a central spreadsheet and sent a ranking to all the contestants.
My friends seized on every update. Who was winning? Who was lagging? And most of all, where was ChatGPT ranked?
The game wrapped up on November 13.
""For the first time in the seven years we've run the contest, I pulled off the win myself,"" Seif wrote in his final email update of the 2025 competition.
ChatGPT came 80th, he wrote, ""and we had 160 players.""
Strange symmetry. I immediately texted my friends: This means ChatGPT is no better than the average human! Not very impressive.
One of my buddies, the CMO, replied: No, this means ChatGPT is as good as the average human. Incredible!
I asked Seif about this, and he had a different way of measuring ChatGPT's predictive power, or lack thereof.
If you'd put a 50% probability for each event happening, you'd have gotten 75,000 points. That's Seif's benchmark for whether contestants added value or not.
ChatGPT got 82,925. So it missed that benchmark, essentially adding negative value, according to Seif.
When there was a lot of existing data to help with forecasting and calculating probabilities, ChatGPT did better, he said.
For instance, the chatbot analyzed this event well, giving it a 70% chance of happening: The winning team of the FIFA Club World Cup is from the European Union.
ChatGPT performed worse when there was a lack of data, or it missed new information that altered the likelihood of an event occurring.
For example, the chatbot assigned a 95% chance of this happening: Astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore safely return to Earth by March 1.
By the end of 2024, news announcements made it clear that this rescue mission was highly unlikely to happen by March 1, 2025, Seif said.
""ChatGPT just wasn't up with the news on that one,"" he added.
Leffell, the hedge fund manager who entered ChatGPT in the game, drew different conclusions and shared some important caveats.
He asked ChatGPT to make these predictions in December 2024. OpenAI's chatbot has improved since then, so its forecasting ability may be better now. Better prompting may have also helped ChatGPT perform better.
Leffell also said that ChatGPT took only a few minutes to understand the complex rules of the game and make 30 predictions—a lot faster than most human contestants.
Leffell himself spent many hours, over several days, to understand the questions and research the events, coming up with his own probabilities.
""It did better than half the people, and it spent a lot less time than everyone else on the challenge,"" he told me. ""If you look at results per minute of work, maybe ChatGPT won?""

31,2025-12-04,"U.S. applications for unemployment benefits fell to their lowest level in more than three years last week, potentially complicating the Federal Reserve’s upcoming decision on interest rates
WASHINGTON -- U.S. applications for unemployment benefits fell to their lowest level in more than three years last week, potentially complicating the Federal Reserve’s upcoming decision on interest rates.
The number of Americans applying for jobless benefits for the week ending Nov. 29 fell to 191,000 from the previous week’s 218,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That’s the lowest level since September 24, 2022, when claims came in at 189,000. Analysts surveyed by the data provider FactSet had forecast initial claims of 221,000.
Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. The job cuts announced recently by large companies such as UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon typically take weeks or months to fully implement and may not be reflected in Thursday’s data. 
For now, the U.S. job market appears stuck in a “low-hire, low-fire” state that has kept the unemployment rate historically low, but has left those out of work struggling to find a new job. 
On Wednesday, private payroll data firm ADP estimated U.S. job losses of 32,000 in November. The surprisingly weak report may be discouraging for people looking for jobs, but it bolstered expectations that the Fed will cut its main interest rate next week. 
It’s not clear how much weight this week’s layoff figures will carry with the Fed as the numbers can be volatile and prone to revisions.
Complicating the Fed’s upcoming decision is inflation, which remains above the central bank’s 2% target. The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation will be released in a government report on Friday and will also be factored into its rate call.
Two weeks ago, the government said that hiring picked up a bit in September, when employers added 119,000 new jobs. That mixed report, which also showed employers had shed jobs in August, was delayed due to the government shutdown. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4%, its highest level in four years, as more Americans returned to the labor market in search of work though they did not all immediately find jobs. 
November’s comprehensive jobs data has been delayed for release until later this month, after the Fed’s meeting, also due to the government shutdown.
The government also recently reported that retail sales slowed in September after three months of healthy increases. 
Consumer confidence has plunged to its second-lowest level in five years, while wholesale inflation eased a bit. 
The data suggests that both the economy and inflation are slowing, which has boosted financial markets’ expectations that the Federal Reserve will reduce its key interest rate at its meeting next week. If the Fed does reduce its benchmark rate next week, it would be the third cut of the year as it attempts to support a job market that has been slowing for months.
Thursday's report from Labor also showed that the four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, fell by 9,500 to 214,750.
The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Nov. 22 dipped by 4,000 to 1.94 million, the government said.

32,2025-12-04,"The JBL Tune Flex earbuds normally retail at $100. Now, they're just $40.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Even as many of the year's best deals wrap up this week, buyers can still find excellent earbud deals and more, if they know where to look. One pick, for example, is Amazon's 60% off on the JBL Tune Flex earbuds, which are a great, affordable pair of buds that are now priced at under $40.
While they may not be the best wireless earbuds on the market, they still offer a really affordable entry price for active noise cancellation, high-quality audio, and crystal clear phone calls. Buyers also say they find the fit comfortable without a silicone ear tip and with the AirPod-like stemmed design.
You might also be hard-pressed to find another pair of earbuds around this price that offers a substantial battery life, ANC, ambient sound modes, and a powerful bass-forward sound profile. This particular deal is available for all three of the colors the Tune Flex buds come in, including Black, Blue, and White.
JBL Tune Flex: $99.95 $39.95 at Amazon
Amazon still has a few deals lingering around after Cyber Monday, including 60% off on the JBL Tune Flex earbuds, bringing them down to just $40. The Tune Flex buds come with ANC, Ambient Aware, and VoiceAware features, along with a long battery life, even for the normal price point.
✅Recommended if: you're looking for a pair of noise-cancelling earbuds for around $40; battery life is a top priority for you when it comes to cheap earbuds; you need something with water resistance for workouts or outdoor adventures.
❌Skip this deal if: you'd prefer over-ear headphones and may want to consider upgrading to some that are on our best JBL headphones list; you want a pair of earbuds with a silicone ear tip for improved fit; you'd prefer a pair of earbuds or headphones with a more balanced audio profile, rather than a bass-heavy one.
The JBL Tune Flex wireless earbuds feature the company's signature Pure Bass Sound, along with ANC, Smart Ambient mode, and four onboard microphones for clear phone calls and voice commands.
JBL says these will get up to 8 hours of battery life per charge when ANC isn't engaged or up to 24 with intermittent use of the charging case. With ANC, the company says they'll get roughly 6 hours per charge and 18 hours with the charging case. Fast charging is also a factor here, with just a 10-minute charge replenishing about 2 hours of playtime, according to JBL.
You can also use the JBL headphones mobile app for a range of EQ and audio customization options, Smart Audio and Video modes, touch control gestures, and more. They also come with an IPX4 water resistance rating, meaning they'll withstand light levels of sweat from workouts or most mild outdoor weather conditions.

34,2025-12-04,"Probably the biggest story in the world of old cars over the past couple of weeks has been the surfacing of a GM EV1 electric car for sale from an auto salvage yard. This was the famous electric car produced in small numbers by the automaker in the 1990s, then only made available for lease before being recalled. The vast majority were controversially crushed with a few units being donated to museums and universities in a non-functional state.
Finding an old car isn’t really a Hackaday story in itself, but now it’s landed in [The Questionable Garage]. It’s being subjected to a teardown as a prelude to its restoration, offering a unique opportunity to look at the state of the art in 1990s electric automotive technology.
The special thing about this car is that by a murky chain of events it ended up as an abandoned vehicle. GM’s legal net covers the rest of the surviving cars, but buying this car as an abandoned vehicle gives the owner legal title over it and frees him from their restrictions. The video is long, but well worth a watch as we see pieces of automotive tech never before shown in public. As we understand it the intention is to bring it to life using parts from GM’s contemporary S10 electric pickup truck — itself a rare vehicle — so we learn quite a bit about those machines too.
Along the way they find an EV1 charger hiding among a stock of pickup chargers, take us through the vehicle electronics, and find some galvanic corrosion in the car’s structure due to water ingress. The windscreen has a huge hole, which they cover with a plastic wrap in order to 3D scan so they can create a replacement.
This car will undoubtedly become a star of the automotive show circuit due to its unique status, so there will be plenty of chances to look at it from the outside in future. Seeing it this close up in parts though is as unique an opportunity as the car itself. We’ve certainly seen far more crusty conventional cars restored to the road, but without the challenge of zero parts availability and no donor cars. Keep an eye out as they bring it closer to the road.


2 hours long? no chapter breaks?
You can get a refund of the viewing fee if you like.
I think I want a refund for the time I spent reading another stub of an article that says “here watch this YouTube video.”
There are other websites on the internet designed to waste your time, maybe go check those out.
Isn’t the point to not waste time?
The average business spends 10% of their revenue on marketing. That is paid from everything I buy, so I’m actually paying something for every second of advertising and marketing, and ad-funded material regardless of whether I watch it or not.
So if I’m not watching stuff that’s paid out of my money, shouldn’t I be getting my money back?
Let’s calculate: I consume around 10 hours of ad-funded content a week, and for that pleasure I pay around 10% of the price of all the stuff I buy. Let’s say that portion is roughly $200. Therefore, if I don’t view this two hours of video this month and only make 8 hours in total, I should be getting a refund for $40.
So where’s my forty bucks?
Or 200 bucks a month for 40 hours of content to be accurate – same point. If I don’t watch this video, or 2 hours of some other clickbait content instead, someone owes me 10 bucks.
Many people don’t realize how much “content” actually costs, because it’s hidden in the system.
Wrong model. Watching ads is the penalty you pay for buying a product whose supplier presents those ads. You have to pay to avoid watching the ads. (Youtube, for example) If people shun advertised products, suppliers who don’t advertise will be more able to succeed. Alas, that has the disadvantage that ad-supported “free” media content would tend to disappear.
Taking a more realistic view, advertising works. For some types of businesses, advertising drives so much more business that efficiencies of scale apply, and the lower unit cost in volume production overwhelms the cost of advertising.
For myself, I boycott products whose ads annoy me. Consequently, I haven’t bought Charmin for more than 50 years. I block advertisers that irritate me (d**bleclick). Advertisers should be less intrusive: banner ads and sidebars are OK, long mid-video interruptions are not.
I’d recommend asking your favorite AI tool to provide a summary….😆
I got to test drive one of these in 1996/1997. It was fast off the line. Would have been a great car for driving around town. Compared to the other ’90s EV options, like the Sparrow, this was a real car with some performance behind it. Also came with a CD player as a standard (selling point at the time).

The Icon Blue DualSense is one of several limited-edition PS5 controllers you can buy for a discounted price right now.
By

 Icon Blue Limited Edition DualSense PS5 Controller 
 $64 (was $85) | Walmart Exclusive 
The Walmart-exclusive Icon Blue DualSense Controller is back in stock and on sale for $64 (was $85). Launched in October, this eye-catching edition of the official PlayStation controller was first discounted to $64 on November 20 when PlayStation's 2025 Holiday Sale kicked off. Walmart sold out before Black Friday weekend and then restocked it at full price--but now it's back on sale alongside other DualSense models. This deal is supposed to run through December 18, but there's no guarantee Walmart will still have units available by then.
Inspired by the PS5's LED light when powered on, the Icon Blue DualSense is meant to capture the ""feeling of anticipation and wonder"" whenever you boot up the PlayStation 5. Other small flourishes include Katakana characters on the back and PlayStation's face button shapes (icons) on the touchpad.
The Icon Blue DualSense launched alongside a handful of Walmart-exclusive PlayStation collectibles, including a few Astro Bot products like this 7-inch Golden Captain Vinyl Figure for $20 and a Pillow Plush for only $16.88. Walmart's listing states the plush is 15 inches, but we bought one and are pleased to report that it's actually 25 inches. If Walmart sells out--the retailer says it has low stock--it's worth noting Amazon has an Astro Bot plush and throw blanket bundle for $25 (was $30).
If Walmart sells out of the $10 Astro Bot Mystery Mini Figures, you can get one of these figures by picking up the CultureFly Astro Bot Collector's Box at Target for $35. You'll also get a blanket, a beanie, an enamel pin, and a travel tumbler. Target also has an exclusive 16-inch Astro Bot Youtooz plushie for $50 and a Youtooz 4.5-inch Vinyl Figure for $30. Check out GameSpot's Astro Bot merch roundup for even more new collectibles themed around PlayStation's unofficial mascot.
 God of War 20th Anniversary DualSense Controller 
 $64 (was $85) 
The Icon Blue was just one of five Limited Edition DualSense Controllers to launch in October. All five are discounted by $20 during PlayStation's Holiday Sale, but retailers are sold out of some models. The Astro Bot Joyful model, for instance, is the first DualSense Controller to sell out at every retailer during the sale. The Ghost of Yotei Gold is sold out everywhere except Target and GameStop, but you can still get the PS Direct-exclusive Ghost of Yotei Black DualSense. The God of War 20th Anniversary DualSense is back in stock at all retailers except for PS Direct.
PlayStation Direct also has the Death Stranding 2: On the Beach edition and last year's Fortnite Limited Edition in stock.
Limited Edition DualSense Controllers:
After selling out of select editions from the Chroma and Deep Earth Collections, Walmart has restocked all of the standard DualSense colors. Walmart is offering an additional $1 discount for most models compared to other retailers.
Amazon's stock situation is more chaotic, as the retailer is sold out of numerous models at the time of writing on December 3.
 DualSense Edge PS5 Controller (Midnight Black) 
 $169 (was $200) 
 DualSense Edge PS5 Controller (White)

If someone were to ask you which sector has led the market over the last three months, you might guess technology. After all, AI is the only thing you seem to hear about when it comes to stocks these days.
You'd be wrong, though — healthcare has actually outperformed every other sector since the start of September as investors have started to look to more defensive assets. The State Street Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLV) has risen 13% over that period, followed by tech and utilities at 9% and 5%, respectively.
One fund that has seen a significant boost during the latest stretch of outperformance is the Tema Oncology ETF (CANC), which has risen 28% since September. Year-to-date, the fund is up 41%.
As its name implies, the fund holds stocks focused on cancer treatments. Earlier this week, I asked David Song, the fund's manager, for a few of his favorite stocks in the fund going forward.
First, he highlighted Revolution Medicines (RVMD), which is the fund's top holding. The stock has gone parabolic recently, gaining 127% since August 11. 
""It has an incredible management team that does science and clinical development really well,"" Song said. ""They have a potential breakthrough in pancreatic cancer therapy.""
Second, Song pointed to Roche Holdings (RHHBY), a Swiss company that has a portfolio of cancer immunology drugs. The stock trades at an attractive PE ratio of 15, Song said, and the company has a number of projects in the works that could continue to propel its share price.
""They have a significant pipeline opportunity that could continue to re-rate this company, this reasonable valued company,"" he said. ""Just to underscore that, they had a recent positive readout in a breast cancer trial.""
Finally is Guardant Health (GH). It's a diagnostics company that produces a liquid biopsy test that can detect cancer early — especially colorectal cancer, which is the fastest-growing cancer among young people in the US.
""This liquid biopsy, the idea that you can potentially detect cancer early, also monitor cancer, through just simple blood draws, is very interesting,"" Song said. ""One of the leaders in this cancer diagnostic space we own is Guardant Health.""

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is drafting the company's annual strategic plan, and he shared key parts of the vision for next year in an interview with Business Insider.
This annual document is called the V2MOM, which stands for Vision, Values, Methods, Obstacles, and Measurements. It's shared internally at the start of each fiscal year, which begins in February. The document often contains important projections. For instance, Business Insider broke details of Salesforce's 2023 plan to cut costs and boost profit margins, which fueled a massive rally in the stock that year. 
More recently, Salesforce has made a huge bet on AI agents with a flagship offering known as Agentforce. Some investors, clients, and employees have cast doubt on the initiative, although the company's earnings on Wednesday revealed some positive signs for the upcoming fiscal year.
The V2MOM document for this upcoming fiscal year will have four main components, Benioff said in an interview following the results.
""The first, most important thing is our data foundation,"" Benioff said. ""None of these agents work without data and context, or you just get all the hallucinations,"" the term for inaccurate AI outputs.
Salesforce recently bought cloud data management company Informatica for $8 billion. This will be combined with existing Salesforce data platforms, Mulesoft and Data 360, to make customer data ""harmonized, federated, and integrated,"" he said. ""That is critical for every customer.""
A strong data foundation is even more important for the generative AI era that's sweeping over the software industry right now. To get the most out of this new technology, companies are weaving their internal data with the intelligence of AI models to create new services and explore efficiencies.
Salesforce handles a massive amount of corporate customer data already. Strengthening this part of its business could help the company build more power AI services, including bolstering its Agentforce efforts.
Benioff said the second component of the strategy for next year sits on top of this data foundation. These are applications such as its popular CRM software, along with Slack, and Tableau data-visualization tools.
The third piece is Agentforce itself, Benioff said, though he provided few details about his vision for this in the V2MOM document, beyond saying the AI service has dramatically evolved over the last year.
The fourth piece is the ""evolution"" of bespoke AI agents that are curated for specific corporate customers such as Williams-Sonoma. This also includes AI agents for employees, such as Salesforce's own Slackbot, which Benioff used liberally to answer questions during the interview with Business Insider.
Salesforce aims to deliver these services by industry, creating versions for automakers, drug companies, and governments, for instance, Benioff explained.

41,2025-12-04,"The age of the Fitbit is over, but that could be good news for your bank account.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

It's time to start thinking about those New Year's resolutions, and if yours include leveling up your fitness regimen, I just found a leftover Cyber Monday Fitbit deal that might make things easier. The Fitbit Charge 6, the latest and greatest band-style wearable from the brand, is still sitting with a 38% discount at Amazon, a full week after Black Friday. 
This sleek wearable boasts a discrete, lightweight design, up to seven days of battery life, and all of the comprehensive health and fitness tracking features that made the brand so iconic. It's also several years old, and one could argue that the age of Fitbit supremacy may be over now that Google's got its hands on the brand. Is this Fitbit Charge 6 deal even worth it? Let's discuss.
Fitbit Charge 6: $159.95 $99.95 at Amazon
Buy the Fitbit Charge 6 in Black or Silver and you'll score a straight 38% off your purchase, knocking the fitness tracker down to just shy of 100 bucks. The Coral version, on the other hand, is available for up to 20% off.  
Despite its age, the Charge 6 continues to be one of the best band-style fitness trackers on the market, with great battery life and loads of accurate health and fitness tracking capabilities. 
Since completing its acquisition of the company back in 2021, Google has been slowly phasing out its attention to Fitbit in favor of the Pixel Watch. This is because, according to the data, most consumers nowadays are more interested in buying a smartwatch with fitness features, rather than a wearable that's solely based on fitness tracking. 
This means that the Charge 6 might be the last traditional Fitbit that we ever see, which is a bummer for folks who simply want to track their fitness goals without all the bells and whistles (and accompanying price tag) of a smartwatch. 
 



The good news is that, despite first hitting store shelves in 2023, the Fitbit Charge 6 is still one of the best fitness trackers that money can buy. You get the iconic petite design that once made Fitbit ubiquitous, plus comprehensive health and fitness tracking that monitors HR, SpO2, ECG, EDA, skin temperature, and more. You also get features like sleep tracking, NFC, and GPS straight out of the box, plus up to seven days of battery life on a single charge.
We were also happy to learn that Google will finally be releasing some new Fitbit hardware in 2026, so hope isn't entirely lost for folks who prefer the band-style fitness tracker. So yes, if you want the absolute best fitness wearable on the market, go with the Pixel Watch 4 or perhaps something from Garmin. But if you want something lightweight and simple that doesn't sacrifice fitness-focused specs, the Charge 6 is still a great choice (especially at this price).

42,2025-12-04,"Some marriages between director and project feel like they must have been orchestrated by the guardian deities of cinema themselves, and such was the case of Guillermo del Toro helming a new ""Frankenstein"" movie. Scripted solo by del Toro as a direct adaptation of Mary Shelley's world-changing 1818 novel ""Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus,"" the 2025 ""Frankenstein"" movie immediately became one of the year's most talked-about films after hitting Netflix in early November.
Like most ""Frankenstein"" adaptations, this one tells the story of Victor Frankenstein (Oscar Isaac), a mad scientist who succeeds in stitching together a creature from disparate human body parts and then jolting it to life via electric current. But del Toro also changes the book in major, fascinating ways. The kicker is that Victor endeavors to raise the Creature (Jacob Elordi) like a father, yet he can't help repeating the harsh and traumatizing upbringing that his own father gave him — a setup that allows del Toro to plunge even further than usual into his pet themes of prejudice, misjudged innocence, familial trauma, and kindness coming up brutally against the societal omnipresence of evil.
What's more, del Toro gets to explore all that within an expressly Gothic milieu, relishing every opportunity for painstakingly-designed somberness, mood, and violence. And it seems safe to say that his gusto has awakened a craving for more Gothic cinema among the moviegoing public. To help with that, we've compiled a list of some great watches if you love the luxuriant sets and outsized emotions of ""Frankenstein.""
Here are the 10 best movies like Guillermo del Toro's ""Frankenstein"" to watch next.
The latest Hollywood adaptation of ""Frankenstein"" could be said to be a continuation of a mainstream Gothic horror revival to which 2024's ""Nosferatu"" similarly belonged. Like Guillermo del Toro's ""Frankenstein,"" this ""Nosferatu"" finds a beloved 21st-century auteur — in this case Robert Eggers — re-animating a classic of early horror cinema with deeply-considered ideas and powerful directorial choices.
Much like del Toro, Eggers doesn't hide his own love for the pure dollhouse pleasure of updating canonical Gothic film with modern-day resources, lavishing both beauty and harrowing grandeur on every visual element of his remake, from the sets to the costumes to the shadow-drenched cinematography. But, also like del Toro, his interest reaches beyond geeky cosmetic reproduction. His ""Nosferatu"" is one that makes a point of pursuing the story's psychosexual themes to their final consequences, actively interrogating what it is about said story that makes it centennially enduring.
In this version, the focus is entirely directed towards Ellen Hutter, the underestimated hero of the original ""Nosferatu."" This time, Ellen (Lily-Rose Depp) gets a whole movie's worth of emotional exploration to lay the groundwork for her climatic interaction with the titular vampire, who is given a brash, counterintuitive interpretation by a prosthetics-caked Bill Skarsgård. Nearly psychological-realist in its emphasis, ""Nosferatu"" asks what it could mean for a relatively normal 19th-century German couple like Ellen and Thomas Hutter (Nicholas Hoult) to come face-to-face with a disruptive force of supernatural proportions; the answers to which Eggers ultimately arrives (and doesn't arrive) are positively unforgettable.
If you're a fan of ""Frankenstein,"" the rest of Guillermo del Toro's filmography makes for a pretty natural recommendation: He's one of our most idiosyncratic and incorrigible working auteurs, and there's a good chance you'll find something to draw you into most if not all of his other films. But 2015's underrated ""Crimson Peak"" is of particular interest to fans of del Toro's latest Gothic confection.
If the entirety of the Mexican writer-director's oeuvre has flaunted its Gothic inflections from the start, ""Crimson Peak"" is the film in which del Toro really gets down to brass tacks and makes a proper, full-fledged homage to the genre — one so devoted and uncompromising as to have ultimately become a box office tragedy. People went to it in multiplexes in 2015 expecting the big-budget ghost horror romp promised by the marketing, but ""Crimson Peak"" is really more of a Gothic romance where, much like in ""Frankenstein,"" the fear and the gruesomeness are primarily tonal furnishing placed tastefully around an emotionally stirring story.
That story, an original one penned by del Toro and Matthew Robbins, tells of Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska), a budding American novelist who marries English baronet Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) and moves with him and his sister Lucille (Jessica Chastain) to their family's estate in Cumberland. As she gets used to her new home, a lush mansion sinking in real time into a red clay mine, Edith faces ghosts, dark secrets, and deliciously heightened melodramatic twists.
The father of all ""revered auteur tackling classic horror"" exercises in modern Hollywood is Francis Ford Coppola's ""Bram Stoker's Dracula."" Released during Coppola's crepuscular '90s period and immediately hailed as his most interesting and vital film in years, ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" is relatively faithful to the letter of Stoker's 1897 novel as far as ""Dracula"" adaptations go, which in itself is reason enough for fans of classic horror literature to give it a stab.
But what really makes ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" a bloody, Gothic delight, and in particular a must-watch for fans of the 2025 ""Frankenstein,"" is that it represents an unparalleled marshalling of resources towards a filmmaker's passion. In a way, it's a precursor to Coppola's much-derided and oft-defended ""Megalopolis"" — if not (at all) in narrative or tone, then at least in the way it finds Coppola using his industry stature and resources to realize a bold, maximalist, spectacle-minded vision that lays bare, above all, his love for the power of cinema.
Gary Oldman stars as the Count, while around him are Winona Ryder as Mina Harker, Keanu Reeves as Jonathan, Tom Waits as Renfield, and Anthony Hopkins as Professor Van Helsing — a cast of fascinating if irregularly successful performances who never once let up on Coppola's dictum to go big. Buoying their commitment to the morbid, bloody eroticism of Stoker's tale is a breathtaking all-around achievement in visual design, including legendary analog special effects and the magnum opus of iconic costume designer Eiko Ishioka.
Speaking of classic vampire novel adaptations that lit up American cinema in the '90s, Neil Jordan's take on Anne Rice's ""Interview with the Vampire"" remains a stirring, highly entertaining film to watch today, even if the ongoing AMC television series has somewhat eclipsed it in the public eye. If you enjoyed the frayed relationships and messed-up familial dynamics of Guillermo del Toro's ""Frankenstein,"" or the sheer gusto with which its superstar players surrender to the heightened drama, then there's a good chance you will enjoy what Jordan does with Rice's seminal novel of dysfunctional gay vampire love.
Scripted by Rice herself, this 1994 adaptation brilliantly cast Tom Cruise as Lestat de Lioncourt and less-than-brilliantly cast Brad Pitt (arguably the film's only unconvincing element) as Louis de Pointe du Lac, two vampires who have been living for centuries as on-again-off-again companions ever since the flamboyant and impulsive Lestat turned the brooding and emotive Louis in the late 18th century. Although the movie tones down the explicitness — and above all the carnality — of their relationship, it still very much drives home its own standing as a queer story, especially as it looks back on Louis and Lestat's efforts to be dads to Claudia (played stunningly by Kirsten Dunst), an 11-year-old girl who gets turned by them and matures into an adult while still inhabiting the body of a child. It's an epic, twisty, existential story of outsized emotions, made viscerally concrete by the force of the horror elements.
Still Guillermo del Toro's masterpiece nearly two decades on, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a perfect alignment of all his greatest strengths as an artist: the visual lushness, the sheer imaginative vitality, the respect for fantasy as a realm of serious dramatic possibility, the thorough political consideration of his themes and their implications, the unflagging sincerity and emotional openness steeped in a clear-eyed sobriety to the world's horrors. It offers a dark fairytale so indelible and perfect that it feels like something that should exist in folk legend, rather than the whole-cloth invention of a single writer-director.
And yet, sure enough, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" boasts an original screenplay by del Toro himself. In that sense, much like ""Crimson Peak,"" it's a fascinating glimpse into the way del Toro's process as a director changes when he's handling a brainchild of his own, compared to a work of adaptation like ""Frankenstein."" In either movie, he's equally passionate about bringing his ideas to fruition — but ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" with its rich, elegant metaphor for fascist complacence and the necessity of defiance, feels like stepping further and further into the deepest recesses of its creator's mind.
Being that it's a mind capable of creating a film this beautiful, terrifying, and primally powerful, that incursion proves enormously thrilling. Plus, this is a movie that shares more than a little thematic ground with ""Frankenstein,"" right down to its evocation of the extent to which a parental authority can inflict tyranny on the children subjected to their whims.
Brazilian filmmakers Juliana Rojas and Marco Dutra have made a habit of exploring delicate emotions and touchy political topics through bombastic genre convention — and 2017's ""Good Manners"" locales them as Latin American twisted fairytale spinners in the same tradition as Guillermo del Toro. For those who enjoyed ""Frankenstein,"" ""Good Manners"" offers a similarly compelling look at the process of raising a nominally ""monstrous"" child in a genuinely monstrous world, the way that process impacts parent and child in different ways, and what that all says about familial bonds.
It's hard to wade into specifics of the parent-child relationship in question without hitting upon spoilers — this is very much a movie you want to go into knowing as little as possible. But the gist of the plot, at least as initially presented, is that São Paulo resident Clara (Isabél Zuaa) applies for a live-in housekeeper-slash-future-nanny job in the apartment of lonely countryside transplant Ana (Marjorie Estiano), who is several months into what might be described as a very unusual pregnancy. Navigating the lifestyle eccentricities of her new boss and eventually becoming her lover in a highly uneasy dynamic, Clara comes to realize that she's gotten herself into a highly dangerous situation. If this description suggests a straightforward domestic thriller, just know that ""Good Manners"" is nothing of the sort. Rotating through horror, romance, comedy, and even musical stylings, Rojas and Dutra create one of the most singular and unclassifiable fantasy films that we've had in years if not decades.
As previously mentioned, Hollywood cinema is currently going through something of a Gothic horror revival, with more and more big-budget, buzzy, highly successful films proving that there's a viable market for straightforward takes on the genre. Bu back when Joe Johnston came out with ""The Wolfman"" in 2010, this was not really the case. Horror-wise, it was a time when the stock of found footage horror, torture porn, and other ""gritty"" and ""realistic"" subgenres was on the rise, and a mainstream American blockbuster about werewolves felt almost out of place in that cultural context. Indeed, ""The Wolfman"" flopped rather spectacularly.
Be that as it may, it's a solid, stylish, suitably spooky film, and very much a precursor to the unapologetic lavishness of ""Frankenstein."" A remake of the 1941 Universal horror flick ""The Wolf Man,"" Johnston's film stars Benicio del Toro as Lawrence Talbot, a man who returns from the United States to his native England following the death of his brother Ben (Simon Merrells). While investigating what happened, Lawrence winds up being attacked by Ben's killer, who turns out to be (you guessed it) a werewolf. 
With moody somberness, dazzlingly massive sets, and Oscar-winning makeup work, the movie then follows Lawrence's excruciating process of transformation into the titular wolfman. At times, it feels like the last gasp of a kind of human-scale monster-based horror cinema that would all but disappear from Hollywood for years, until the ongoing wave of renewed interest in the Gothic finally, thankfully revived it.
David Lynch's ""The Elephant Man"" differs from other movies on this list in that it's a biographicial drama set (ostensibly) in the real world with no (explicit) elements of fantasy. But it's nonetheless a vital item in the syllabus of definitional movies about radical solidarity with those deemed abject creatures by society. That the only ""crime"" of John Merrick (John Hurt) is to be someone people are displeased to look at, no matter how persuasively he puts forth his intelligence and kind-heartedness, only makes this particular portrait of arbitrary monster-ification all the more poignant.
Lynch takes cues from Gothic literature and Gothic cinema alike in his fictionalized telling of the life of Joseph Merrick, a Victorian-era Englishman whose significant physical deformities made him a pariah but didn't stop him from pursuing a fulfilling, creatively rich life to the best of his possibilities. Lynch initially shrouds his John Merrick in the darkness and oblique mystery of a Universal monster, goading the audience to feel the trepidation with which Merrick's society viewed him. But this expedient quickly turns out to be a ruse, as it emerges that Lynch sees his protagonist with nothing but respect and admiration (even if his penchant for surrealism errs on sensationalizing Merrick a smidge too much). One of the very best movies of the 1980s, it's a deeply sad yet life-affirming portrait of a vibrant life unjustly lived in the shadows — a tonal and thematic companion to ""Frankenstein"" in a vastly different genre register.
Before offering his own directorial take on ""Frankenstein,"" Guillermo del Toro helped give it a highly messed-up 21st-century update by executive producing Vincenzo Natali's ""Splice."" An original sci-fi horror flick with a distinctly late-2000s bluish sheen and a veritable arsenal of gleefully unconscionable decisions, ""Splice"" will certainly not be a movie to everyone's taste, and accordingly bombed at the box office. But it definitely deserves mention as a kindred project to del Toro's ""Frankenstein.""
Sarah Polley and Adrien Brody star as Elsa Kast and Clive Nicoli, two genetic engineers and romantic partners who carry out a clandestine human-animal hybridization experiment. The experiment ultimately creates Dren (Delphine Chanéac), an anthropomorphic female creature who grows at a much more rapid pace than a human child. But, as Dren reveals herself to have a taste for flesh and a slew of unexpected biological features, Elsa and Clive (aptly named after actors Elsa Lanchester and Colin Clive from the original ""Frankenstein"" films) find themselves unsure of what to do with their new genetically engineered half-human surrogate daughter.
From there on out, ""Splice"" probes depths of taboo, moral murkiness, and squeamish biological speculation that make it a genuinely stunning and frequently nauseating watch (including, it should be warned, a gruesome and willfully disturbing depiction of sexual violence near the end). It's the kind of movie you're likely to either loathe entirely or fall in love with, and it's easy to understand why del Toro, bless his heart, would fall into the latter camp.
Before Guillermo del Toro's ""Frankenstein,"" before James Whale's ""Frankenstein,"" and before any other example of a horror movie as we currently understand them, really, there was ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari."" The 1920 Robert Wiene film that epitomized German Expressionism, invented framing devices and twist endings, predicted the rise of Nazism a decade before the fact, and inspired goth style was also, by most criteria, the inaugural scary flick. While its influence looms large over pretty much all of cinema, it casts a particularly strong shadow on all iterations of ""Frankenstein,"" especially del Toro's.
The film's original script by Carl Mayer and Hans Janowitz tells of the titular carnival entertainer (Werner Krauss), who hypnotizes the star of his number, hapless somnambulist Cesare (Conrad Veidt), into committing murder on his behalf. Filled with the highly stylized sets and lighting choices that were typical of German Expressionism, ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" is still one of the horror movies with the best cinematography, more than a century of conscious and unconscious imitators later. 
But the core of its enduring impact is the way it clashes Caligari's murderous amorality with Cesare's childlike innocence, yielding a gut-wrenching, psychologically charged tragedy that lies at the base of genre cinema's formation. Naturally, ""Caligari"" is a visible influence on the entire filmography of del Toro, echoing through his approach to framing, production design, and storytelling, which makes ""Frankenstein'""s own story of ruthless creator and misunderstood creature a kind of full-circle moment."

The move: Meta Platforms stock spiked on Thursday, with the social media company seeing $69 billion added to its market cap, bringing its total value to $1.68 trillion. The stock rose as much as 4%, and is up 13% year-to-date.
The chart:
Why: The stock's most recent surge follows a report from Bloomberg that the company plans to scale back its metaverse efforts, with executives set to slash budgets in that part of the business by 30%, according to the report.
When the company changed its name from Facebook to Meta Platforms in October 2021, CEO Mark Zuckerberg framed metaverse technology as its future. The buzz around the technology ultimately faded shortly after the company's rebranding, and despite its namesake, the company has pivoted hard to AI in the last few years.
What it means: It's another indication that Meta views the future primarily through the lens of AI.
Despite Zuckerberg's historic bet on the metaverse and his belief that it would play a key role in the future of tech, the company hasn't seen much of a return.
The Reality Labs Division has been a money loser for Meta, with losses reaching $70 billion since 2021, according to Bloomberg. On Meta's most recent earnings call, the metaverse wasn't mentioned once.
The market's response to Zuckerberg's decision to shift focus away from metaverse spending makes it clear that Wall Street isn't lameting the reduced focus on the metaverse, as investors continue to see AI as the dominant force in tech and the broader stock market.

45,2025-12-04,"An Empirical 100 Trillion Token Study with OpenRouter
The past year has marked a turning point in the evolution and real-world use of large language models (LLMs). With the release of the first widely adopted reasoning model, o1, on December 5th, 2024, the field shifted from single-pass pattern generation to multi-step deliberation inference, accelerating deployment, experimentation, and new classes of applications. As this shift unfolded at a rapid pace, our empirical understanding of how these models have actually been used in practice has lagged behind. In this work, we leverage the OpenRouter platform, which is an AI inference provider across a wide variety of LLMs, to analyze over 100 trillion tokens of real-world LLM interactions across tasks, geographies, and time. In our empirical study, we observe substantial adoption of open-weight models, the outsized popularity of creative roleplay (beyond just the productivity tasks many assume dominate) and coding assistance categories, plus the rise of agentic inference. Furthermore, our retention analysis identifies foundational cohorts: early users whose engagement persists far longer than later cohorts. We term this phenomenon the Cinderella ""Glass Slipper"" effect. These findings underscore that the way developers and end-users engage with LLMs ""in the wild"" is complex and multifaceted. We discuss implications for model builders, AI developers, and infrastructure providers, and outline how a data-driven understanding of usage can inform better design and deployment of LLM systems.
Just a year ago, the landscape of large language models looked fundamentally different. Prior to late 2024, state-of-the-art systems were dominated by single-pass, autoregressive predictors optimized to continue text sequences. Several precursor efforts attempted to approximate reasoning through advanced instruction following and tool use. For instance, Anthropic's Sonnet 2.1 & 3 models excelled at sophisticated tool use and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Cohere's Command R models incorporated structured tool-planning tokens. Separately, open source projects like those done by Reflection explored supervised chain-of-thought and self-critique loops during training. Although these advanced techniques produced reasoning-like outputs and superior instruction following, the fundamental inference procedure remained based on a single forward pass, emitting a surface-level trace learned from data rather than performing iterative, internal computation.
This paradigm evolved on December 5, 2024, when OpenAI released the first full version of its o1 reasoning model (codenamed Strawberry) [4]. The preview released on September 12, 2024 had already indicated a departure from conventional autoregressive inference. Unlike prior systems, o1 employed an expanded inference-time computation process involving internal multi-step deliberation, latent planning, and iterative refinement before generating a final output. Empirically, this enabled systematic improvements in mathematical reasoning, logical consistency, and multi-step decision-making, reflecting a shift from pattern completion to structured internal cognition. In retrospect, last year marked the field's true inflection point: earlier approaches gestured toward reasoning, but o1 introduced the first generally-deployed architecture that performed reasoning through deliberate multi-stage computation rather than merely describing it [6, 7].
While recent advances in LLM capabilities have been widely documented, systematic evidence about how these models are actually used in practice remains limited [3, 5]. Existing accounts tend to emphasize qualitative demonstrations or benchmark performance rather than large-scale behavioral data. To bridge this gap, we undertake an empirical study of LLM usage, leveraging a 100 trillion token dataset from OpenRouter, a multi-model AI inference platform that serves as a hub for diverse LLM queries.
OpenRouter's vantage point provides a unique window into fine-grained usage patterns. Because it orchestrates requests across a wide array of models (spanning both closed source APIs and open-weight deployments), OpenRouter captures a representative cross-section of how developers and end-users actually invoke language models for various tasks. By analyzing this rich dataset, we can observe which models are chosen for which tasks, how usage varies across geographic regions and over time, and how external factors like pricing or new model launches influence behavior.
In this paper, we draw inspiration from prior empirical studies of AI adoption, including Anthropic's economic impact and usage analyses [1] and OpenAI's report How People Use ChatGPT [2], aiming for a neutral, evidence-driven discussion. We first describe our dataset and methodology, including how we categorize tasks and models. We then delve into a series of analyses that illuminate different facets of usage:
Finally, we discuss what these findings reveal about real-world LLM usage, highlighting unexpected patterns and correcting some myths.
Our analysis is based on metadata collected from the OpenRouter platform, a unified AI inference layer that connects users and developers to hundreds of large language models. Each user request on OpenRouter is executed against a user-selected model, and structured metadata describing the resulting ""generation"" event is logged. The dataset used in this study consists of anonymized request-level metadata for billions of prompt–completion pairs from a global user base, spanning approximately two years up to the time of writing. We do zoom in on the last year.
Crucially, we did not have access to the underlying text of prompts or completions. Our analysis relies entirely on metadata that capture the structure, timing, and context of each generation, without exposing user content. This privacy-preserving design enables large-scale behavioral analysis.
Each generation record includes information on timing, model and provider identifiers, token usage, and system performance metrics. Token counts encompass both prompt (input) and completion (output) tokens, allowing us to measure overall model workload and cost. Metadata also include fields related to geographic routing, latency, and usage context (for example, whether the request was streamed or cancelled, or whether tool-calling features were invoked). Together, these attributes provide a detailed but non-textual view of how models are used in practice.
All analyses, aggregations, and most visualizations based on this metadata were conducted using the Hex analytics platform, which provided a reproducible pipeline for versioned SQL queries, transformations, and final figure generation.
We emphasize that this dataset is observational: it reflects real-world activity on the OpenRouter platform, which itself is shaped by model availability, pricing, and user preferences. As of 2025, OpenRouter supports more than 300+ active models from over 60 providers and serves millions of developers and end-users, with over 50% of usage originating outside the United States. While certain usage patterns outside the platform are not captured, OpenRouter's global scale and diversity make it a representative lens on large-scale LLM usage dynamics.
No direct access to user prompts or model outputs was available for this study. Instead, OpenRouter performs internal categorization on a random sample comprising approximately 0.25% of all prompts and responses through a non-proprietary module GoogleTagClassifier. While this represents only a fraction of total activity, the underlying dataset remains substantial given the overall query volume processed by OpenRouter. GoogleTagClassifier interfaces with Google Cloud Natural Language's classifyText content-classification API
The API applies a hierarchical, language-agnostic taxonomy to textual input, returning one or more category paths (e.g., /Computers & Electronics/Programming, /Arts & Entertainment/Roleplaying Games) with corresponding confidence scores in the range [0,1]. The classifier operates directly on prompt data (up to the first 1,000 characters). The classifier is deployed within OpenRouter's infrastructure, ensuring that classifications remain anonymous and are not linked to individual customers. Categories with confidence scores below the default threshold of 0.5 are excluded from further analysis. The classification system itself operates entirely within OpenRouter's infrastructure and was not part of this study; our analysis relied solely on the resulting categorical outputs (effectively metadata describing prompt classifications) rather than the underlying prompt content.
To make these fine-grained labels useful at scale, we map GoogleTagClassifier's taxonomy to a compact set of study-defined buckets and assign each request tags. Each tag rolls up to higher level category in one to one way. Representative mappings include:
There are inherent limitations to this approach, for instance, reliance on a predefined taxonomy constrains how novel or cross-domain behaviors are categorized, and certain interaction types may not yet fit neatly within existing classes. In practice, some prompts receive multiple category labels when their content spans overlapping domains. Nonetheless, the classifier-driven categorization provides us with a lens for downstream analyses. This enables us to quantify not just how much LLMs are used but what for.
A few variants are worth explicitly calling out:
Unless otherwise noted, token volume refers to the sum of prompt (input) and completion (output) tokens.
To understand regional patterns in LLM usage, we segment requests by user geography. Direct request metadata (like IP-based location) is typically imprecise or anonymized. Instead, we determine user region based on the billing location associated with each account. This provides a more reliable proxy for user geography, as billing data reflects the country or region linked to the user's payment method or account registration. We use this billing-based segmentation in our analysis of regional adoption and model preferences.
This method has limitations. Some users employ third-party billing or shared organizational accounts, which may not correspond to their actual location. Enterprise accounts may aggregate activity across multiple regions under one billing entity. Despite these imperfections, billing geography remains the most stable and interpretable indicator available for privacy-preserving geographic analysis given the metadata we had access to.
Our analyses primarily cover a rolling 13-month period ending on November, 2025, but not all underlying metadata spans this full window. Most model-level and pricing analyses were focused on November 3, 2024 – November 30, 2025 time frame. However, category-level analyses (especially those using the GoogleTagClassifier taxonomy) are based on a shorter interval beginning in May 2025, reflecting when consistent tagging became available on OpenRouter. In particular, detailed task classification fields (e.g., tags such as Programming, Roleplay, or Technology) were only added in mid-2025. Consequently, all findings in the Categories section should be interpreted as representative of mid-2025 usage rather than the entire prior year.
Unless otherwise specified, all time-series aggregates are computed on a weekly basis using UTC-normalized timestamps, summing prompt and completion tokens. This approach ensures comparability across model families and minimizes bias from transient spikes or regional time-zone effects.
A central question in the AI ecosystem is the balance between open-weight (that we abbreviate to OSS for simplicity) and proprietary models. The figures below illustrate how this balance has evolved on OpenRouter over the past year. While proprietary models, especially those from major North American providers, still serve the majority of tokens, OSS models have grown steadily, reaching approximately one-third of usage by late 2025.
This expansion is not incidental. Usage spikes align with major open-model releases such as DeepSeek V3 and Kimi K2 (indicated by vertical dashed lines in the first figure), suggesting that competitive OSS launches such as DeepSeek V3 [9] and GPT OSS models [8] are adopted rapidly and sustain their gains. Importantly, these increases persist beyond initial release weeks, implying genuine production use rather than short-term experimentation.
A significant share of this growth has come from Chinese-developed models. Starting from a negligible base in late 2024 (weekly share as low as 1.2%), Chinese OSS models steadily gained traction, reaching nearly 30% of total usage among all models in some weeks. Over the one-year window, they averaged approximately 13.0% of weekly token volume, with strong growth concentrated in the second half of 2025. For comparison, RoW OSS models averaged 13.7%, while proprietary RoW models retained the largest share (70% on average). The expansion of Chinese OSS reflects not only competitive quality, but also rapid iteration and dense release cycles. Models like Qwen and DeepSeek maintained regular model releases that enabled fast adaptation to emerging workloads. This pattern has materially reshaped the open source segment and progressed global competition across the LLM landscape.
These trends indicate a durable dual structure in the LLM ecosystem. Proprietary systems continue to define the upper bound of reliability and performance, particularly for regulated or enterprise workloads. OSS models, by contrast, offer cost efficiency, transparency, and customization, making them an attractive option for certain workloads. The equilibrium is currently reached at roughly 30%. These models are not mutually exclusive; rather, they complement each other within a multi-model stack that developers and infrastructure providers increasingly favor.
The table below ranks the top model families in our dataset by total token volume served. The landscape of OSS models has shifted significantly over the last year: while DeepSeek remains the single largest OSS contributor by volume, its dominance has waned as new entrants rapidly gain ground. Today, multiple open source families each sustain substantial usage, pointing to a diversified ecosystem.
This figure illustrates the dramatic evolution of market share among the top individual open source models week by week. Early in the period (late 2024), the market was highly consolidated: two models from the DeepSeek family (V3 and R1) consistently accounted for over half of all OSS token usage, forming the large, dark blue bands at the bottom of the chart.
This near-monopoly structure shattered following the Summer Inflection (mid-2025). The market has since become both broader and deeper, with usage diversifying significantly. New entrants like Qwen's models, Minimax's M2, MoonshotAI's Kimi K2, and OpenAI's GPT-OSS series all grew rapidly to serve significant portions of requests, often achieving production-scale adoption within weeks of release. This signals that the open source community and AI startups can achieve quick adoption by introducing models with novel capabilities or superior efficiency.
By late 2025, the competitive balance had shifted from near-monopoly to a pluralistic mix. No single model exceeds 25% of OSS tokens, and the token share is now distributed more evenly across five to seven models. The practical implication is that users are finding value in a wider array of options, rather than defaulting to one ""best"" choice. Although this figure visualizes relative share among OSS models (not absolute volume), the clear trend is a decisive shift toward market fragmentation and increased competition within the open source ecosystem.
Overall, the open source model ecosystem is now highly dynamic. Key insights include:
Today the open source LLM arena in 2025 resembles a competitive ecosystem where innovation cycles are rapid and leadership is not guaranteed. For model builders, this means that releasing an open model with state-of-the-art performance can yield immediate uptake, but maintaining usage share requires ongoing investment in further development. For users and application developers, the trend is positive: there is a richer selection of open models to choose from, often with comparable or sometimes superior capabilities to proprietary systems in specific areas (like roleplay).
A year ago, the open source model ecosystem was largely a story of trade-offs between two extremes: a vast number of small, fast models and a handful of powerful, large-scale models. However, a review of the past year reveals a significant maturation of the market and the emergence of a new, growing category: the medium-sized model. Please note that we categorize models by their parameter count as follows:
The data on developer and user behavior tells us a nuanced story. The figures show that while the number of models across all categories has grown, the usage has shifted notably. Small models are losing favor while medium and large models are capturing that value.
A deeper look at the models driving these trends reveals distinct market dynamics:
The era of small models dominating the open source ecosystem might be behind. The market is now bifurcating, with users either gravitating toward a new, robust class of medium models, or consolidating their workloads onto the single most capable large model.
Open-source models today are employed for a remarkably broad range of tasks, spanning creative, technical, and informational domains. While proprietary models still dominate in structured business tasks, OSS models have carved out leadership in two particular areas: creative roleplay and programming assistance. Together, these categories account for the majority of OSS token usage.
The figure above highlights that more than half of all OSS model usage falls under Roleplay, with Programming being the second-largest category. This indicates that users turn to open models primarily for creative interactive dialogues (such as storytelling, character roleplay, and gaming scenarios) and for coding-related tasks. The dominance of roleplay (hovering at more than 50% of all OSS tokens) underscores a use case where open models have an edge: they can be utilized for creativity and are often less constrained by content filters, making them attractive for fantasy or entertainment applications. Roleplay tasks require flexible responses, context retention, and emotional nuance - attributes that open models can deliver effectively without being heavily restricted by commercial safety or moderation layers. This makes them particularly appealing for communities experimenting with character-driven experiences, fan fiction, interactive games, and simulation environments.
The figure above shows category breakdown over time if we zoom in on Chinese OSS models only. These models are no longer used primarily for creative tasks. Roleplay remains the largest category at around 33%, but programming and technology now account for a combined majority of usage (39%). This shift suggests that models like Qwen and DeepSeek are increasingly used for code generation and infrastructure-related workloads. While high-volume enterprise users may influence specific segments, the overall trend points to Chinese OSS models competing directly in technical and productivity domains.
If we zoom in just on the programming category, we observe that proprietary models still handle the bulk of coding assistance overall (the gray region), reflecting strong offerings like Anthropic's Claude. However, within the OSS portion, there was a notable transition: in mid-2025, Chinese OSS models (blue) delivered the majority of open source coding help (driven by early successes like Qwen 3 Coder). By Q4 2025, Western OSS models (orange) such as Meta's LLaMA-2 Code and OpenAI's GPT-OSS series had surged, but decreased in overall share in recent weeks. This oscillation suggests a very competitive environment. The practical takeaway is that open source code assistant usage is dynamic and highly responsive to new model quality: developers are open to whichever OSS model currently provides the best coding support. As a limitation, this figure doesn't show absolute volumes: open source coding usage grew overall so a shrinking blue band doesn't mean Chinese OSS lost users, only relative share.
Now if we examine just the roleplay traffic, we see that it is now almost equally served by Rest-of-World OSS (orange, 43% in recent weeks) and Closed (gray, at ~42% most recently) models. This represents a significant shift from earlier in 2025, when the category was dominated by proprietary (gray) models, which held approximately 70% of the token share. At that time (May 2025), Western OSS models accounted for only ~22% of traffic, and Chinese OSS (blue) models held a small share of ~8%. Throughout the year, the proprietary share steadily eroded. By the end of October 2025, this trend accelerated as both Western and Chinese open source models gained significant ground.
The resulting convergence indicates a healthy competition; users have viable choices from both open and proprietary offerings for creative chats and storytelling. This reflects that developers recognize the demand for roleplay/chat models and have tailored their releases to that end (e.g., fine-tuning on dialogues, adding alignment for character consistency). A point to note is that ""roleplay"" covers a range of subgenres (from casual chatting to complex game scenarios). Yet from a macro perspective, it is clear OSS models have an edge in this creative arena.

Broadly, across the OSS ecosystem, the key use cases are: Roleplay and creative dialogue: the top category, likely because open models can be uncensored or more easily customized for fictional persona and story tasks. Programming assistance: second-largest, and growing, as open models become more competent at code. Many developers leverage OSS models locally for coding to avoid API costs. Translation and multilingual support: a steady use case, especially with strong bilingual models available (Chinese OSS models have an edge here). General knowledge Q&A and education: moderate usage; while open models can answer questions, users may prefer closed models like GPT-5 for highest factual accuracy.
It is worth noting that the OSS usage pattern (heavy on roleplay) mirrors what many might consider for ""enthusiasts"" or ""indie developers"" - areas where customization and cost-efficiency trump absolute accuracy. The lines are blurring, though: OSS models are rapidly improving in technical domains, and proprietary models are being used creatively too.
Building on the previous section's view of the evolving model landscape (open vs closed source), we now turn to the fundamental shape of LLM usage itself. A foundational shift is underway in how language models are used in production: from single-turn text completion toward multi-step, tool-integrated, and reasoning-intensive workflows. We refer to this shift as the rise of agentic inference, where models are deployed not just to generate text, but to act through planning, calling tools, or interacting across extended contexts. This section traces that shift through five proxies: the rise of reasoning models, the expansion of tool-calling behavior, the changing sequence length profile, and how programming use drives complexity.
As shown in the figure above, the share of total tokens routed through reasoning-optimized models climbed sharply in 2025. What was effectively a negligible slice of usage in early Q1 now exceeds fifty percent. This shift reflects both sides of the market. On the supply side, the release of higher-capability systems like GPT-5, Claude 4.5, and Gemini 3 expanded what users could expect from stepwise reasoning. On the demand side, users increasingly prefer models that can manage task state, follow multi-step logic, and support agent-style workflows rather than simply generate text.
The figure above shows the top models driving this shift. In the most recent data, xAI's Grok Code Fast 1 now drives the largest share of reasoning traffic (excluding free launch access), ahead of Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Flash. This is a notable change from only a few weeks ago, when Gemini 2.5 Pro led the category and DeepSeek R1 and Qwen3 were also in the top tier. Grok Code Fast 1 and Grok 4 Fast have gained share quickly, supported by xAI's aggressive rollout, competitive pricing, and developer attention around its code-oriented variants. At the same time, the continued presence of open models like OpenAI's gpt-oss-120b underscores that developers still reach for OSS when possible. The mix overall highlights how dynamic the reasoning landscape has become, with rapid model turnover shaping which systems dominate real workloads.
The data points to a clear conclusion: reasoning-oriented models are becoming the default path for real workloads, and the share of tokens flowing through them is now a leading indicator of how users want to interact with AI systems.
In the figure above, we report the share of total tokens originating from requests whose finish reason was a Tool Call. This metric is normalized and captures only those interactions in which a tool was actually invoked.
This is in contrast to the Input Tool signal that records whether a tool was provided to the model during a request (regardless of invocation). Input Tool counts are, by definition, higher than Tool Call finish reasons, since provision is a superset of successful execution. Whereas the finish-reason metric measures realized tool use, Input Tool reflects potential availability rather than actual invocation. Because this metric was introduced only in September 2025, we are not reporting it in this paper.
The noticeable spike in May in the figure above was largely attributable to one sizable account whose activity briefly lifted overall volumes. Aside from this anomaly, tool adoption has shown a consistent upward trend throughout the year.
As shown in the figure above, tool invocation was initially concentrated among a small group of models: OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini and Anthropic's Claude 3.5 and 3.7 series, which together accounted for most tool-enabled tokens in early 2025. By mid-year, however, a broader set of models began supporting tool provision, reflecting a more competitive and diversified ecosystem. From end of September onward, newer Claude 4.5 Sonnet model rapidly gained share. Meanwhile, newer entries like Grok Code Fast and GLM 4.5 have made visible inroads, reflecting broader experimentation and diversification in tool-capable deployments.
For operators, the implication is clear: enabling tool use is on the rise for high-value workflows. Models without reliable tool formats risk falling behind in enterprise adoption and orchestration environments.
The shape of model workloads has evolved markedly over the past year. Both prompt (input) and completion (output) token volumes have risen sharply, though at different scales and rates. Average prompt tokens per request have increased roughly fourfold from around 1.5K to over 6K while completions have nearly tripled from about 150 to 400 tokens. The relative magnitude of growth highlights a decisive shift toward more complex, context-rich workloads.
This pattern reflects a new equilibrium in model usage. The typical request today is less about open-ended generation (""write me an essay"") and more about reasoning over substantial user-provided material such as codebases, documents, transcripts, or long conversations, and producing concise, high-value insights. Models are increasingly acting as analytical engines rather than creative generators.
Category-level data (available only since Spring 2025) provides a more nuanced picture: programming workloads are the dominant driver of prompt token growth. Requests involving code understanding, debugging, and code generation routinely exceed 20K input tokens, while all other categories remain relatively flat and low-volume. This asymmetric contribution suggests that the recent expansion in prompt size is not a uniform trend across tasks but rather a concentrated surge tied to software development and technical reasoning use cases.
Sequence length is a proxy for task complexity and interaction depth. The figure above shows that average sequence length has more than tripled over the past 20 months from under 2,000 tokens in late 2023 to over 5,400 by late 2025. This growth reflects a structural shift toward longer context windows, deeper task history, and more elaborate completions.
As per previous section, the second figure adds further clarity: programming-related prompts now average 3–4 times the token length of general-purpose prompts. The divergence indicates that software development workflows are the primary driver of longer interactions. Long sequences are not just user verbosity: they are a signature of embedded, more sophisticated agentic workflows.
Together, these trends (rising reasoning share, expanded tool use, longer sequences, and programming's outsize complexity) suggest that the center of gravity in LLM usage has shifted. The median LLM request is no longer a simple question or isolated instruction. Instead, it is part of a structured, agent-like loop, invoking external tools, reasoning over state, and persisting across longer contexts.
For model providers, this raises the bar for default capabilities. Latency, tool handling, context support, and robustness to malformed or adversarial tool chains are increasingly critical. For infra operators, inference platforms must now manage not just stateless requests but long-running conversations, execution traces, and permission-sensitive tool integrations. Soon enough, if not already, agentic inference will be taking over the majority of the inference.
Understanding the distribution of tasks that users perform with LLMs is central to assessing real-world demand and model–market fit. As described in the Data and Methodology section, we categorized billions of model interactions into high-level application categories. In the Open vs. Closed Source Models section, we focused on open source models to see community-driven usage. Here, we broaden the lens to all LLM usage on OpenRouter (both closed and open models) to get a comprehensive picture of what people use LLMs for in practice.
Programming has become the most consistently expanding category across all models. The share of programming-related requests has grown steadily through 2025, paralleling the rise of LLM-assisted development environments and tool integrations. As shown in the figure above, programming queries accounted for roughly 11% of total token volume in early 2025 and exceeded 50% in recent weeks. This trend reflects a shift from exploratory or conversational use toward applied tasks such as code generation, debugging, and data scripting. As LLMs become embedded in developer workflows, their role as programming tools is being normalized. This evolution has implications for model development, including increased emphasis on code-centric training data, improved reasoning depth for multi-step programming tasks, and tighter feedback loops between models and integrated development environments.
This growing demand for programming support is reshaping competitive dynamics across model providers. As shown in the figure below, Anthropic's Claude series has consistently dominated the category, accounting for more than 60% of programming-related spend for most of the observed period. The landscape has nevertheless evolved meaningfully. During the week of November 17, Anthropic's share fell below the 60% threshold for the first time. Since July, OpenAI has expanded its share from roughly 2% to about 8% in recent weeks, likely reflecting a renewed emphasis on developer-centric workloads. Over the same interval, Google's share has remained stable at approximately 15%. The mid-tier segment is also in motion. Open source providers including Z.AI, Qwen, and Mistral AI are steadily gaining mindshare. MiniMax, in particular, has emerged as a fast-rising entrant, showing notable gains in recent weeks.
Overall, programming has become one of the most contested and strategically important model categories. It attracts sustained attention from top labs, and even modest changes in model quality or latency can shift share week to week. For infrastructure providers and developers, this highlights the need for continual benchmarking and evals, especially as the frontier is constantly evolving.
The figures above break down LLM usage across the twelve most common content categories, revealing the internal sub-topic structure of each. A key takeaway is that most categories are not evenly distributed: they are dominated by one or two recurring use patterns, often reflecting concentrated user intent or alignment with LLM strengths.
Among the highest-volume categories, roleplay stands out for its consistency and specialization. Nearly 60% of roleplay tokens fall under Games/Roleplaying Games, suggesting that users treat LLMs less as casual chatbots and more as structured roleplaying or character engines. This is further reinforced by the presence of Writers Resources (15.6%) and Adult content (15.4%), pointing to a blend of interactive fiction, scenario generation, and personal fantasy. Contrary to assumptions that roleplay is mostly informal dialogue, the data show a well-defined and replicable genre-based use case.
Programming is similarly skewed, with over two-thirds of traffic labeled as Programming/Other. This signals the broad and general-purpose nature of code-related prompts: users are not narrowly focused on specific tools or languages but are asking LLMs for everything from logic debugging to script drafting. That said, Development Tools (26.4%) and small shares from scripting languages indicate emerging specialization. This fragmentation highlights an opportunity for model builders to improve tagging or training around structured programming workflows.
Beyond the dominant categories of roleplay and programming, the remaining domains represent a diverse but lower-volume tail of LLM usage. While individually smaller, they reveal important patterns about how users interact with models across specialized and emerging tasks. For example, translation, science, and health show relatively flat internal structure. In translation, usage is nearly evenly split between Foreign Language Resources (51.1%) and Other, suggesting diffuse needs: multilingual lookup, rephrasing, light code-switching, rather than sustained document-level translation. Science is dominated by a single tag, Machine Learning & AI (80.4%), indicating that most scientific queries are meta-AI questions rather than general STEM topics like physics or biology. This reflects either user interest or model strengths skewed toward self-referential inquiry.
Health, in contrast, is the most fragmented of the top categories, with no sub-tag exceeding 25%. Tokens are spread across medical research, counseling services, treatment guidance, and diagnostic lookups. This diversity highlights the domain's complexity, but also the challenge of modeling it safely: LLMs must span high variance user intent, often in sensitive contexts, without clear concentration in a single use case.
What links these long-tail categories is their broadness: users turn to LLMs for exploratory, lightly structured, or assistance-seeking interactions, but without the focused workflows seen in programming or personal assistants. Taken together, these secondary categories may not dominate volume, but they hint at latent demand. They signal that LLMs are being used at the fringes of many fields from translation to medical guidance to AI introspection and that as models improve in domain robustness and tooling integration, we may see these scattered intents converge into clearer, higher-volume applications.
By contrast, finance, academia, and legal are much more diffuse. Finance spreads its volume across foreign exchange, socially responsible investing, and audit/accounting: no single tag breaks 20%. Legal shows similar entropy, with usage split between Government/Other (43.0%) and Legal/Other (17.8%). This fragmentation may reflect the complexity of these domains, or simply the lack of targeted LLM workflows for them compared to more mature categories like coding and chat.
The data suggest that real-world LLM usage is not uniformly exploratory: it clusters tightly around a small set of repeatable, high-volume tasks. Roleplay, programming, and personal assistance each exhibit clear structure and dominant tags. Science, health, and legal domains, by contrast, are more diffuse and likely under-optimized. These internal distributions can guide model design, domain-specific fine-tuning, and application-level interfaces particularly in tailoring LLMs to user goals.
Different model authors are utilized in different usage patterns. The figures below show the distribution of content categories for major model families (Anthropic's Claude, Google's models, OpenAI's GPT series, DeepSeek, and Qwen). Each bar represents 100% of that provider's token usage, broken down by top tags.
Anthropic's Claude is heavily skewed toward Programming + Technology uses, which together exceed 80% of its usage. Roleplay and general Q&A are only a small sliver. This confirms Claude's positioning as a model optimized for complex reasoning, coding, and structured tasks; developers and enterprises appear to use Claude mainly as a coding assistant and problem solver.
Google's model usage is more diverse. We see notable segments for Translation, Science, Technology, and some General Knowledge. For instance, ~5% of Google's usage was legal or policy content, and another ~10% science-related. It might hint at Gemini's broad training focus. Compared to others, Google has relatively less and, in fact, declining coding share by late 2025 (down to roughly 18%) and a broader tail of categories. This suggests Google's models are being used more as general-purpose information engines.
xAI's usage profile is distinct from the other providers. For most of the period, usage is overwhelmingly concentrated in Programming, often exceeding eighty percent of all tokens. Only in late November does the distribution broaden, with noticeable gains in Technology, Roleplay, and Academia. This sharp shift aligns with the timing of xAI's model being distributed at no cost through select consumer applications, which likely introduced a large influx of non-developer traffic. The result is a usage composition that blends an early, developer-heavy core with a sudden wave of general-purpose engagement, suggesting that xAI's adoption path is being shaped both by technical users and by episodic surges tied to promotional availability.
OpenAI's usage profile has shifted markedly through 2025. Earlier in the year, science tasks accounted for more than half of all OpenAI tokens; by late 2025, that share had declined to under 15%. Meanwhile, programming and technology-related usage now comprise more than half of total volume (29% each), reflecting deeper integration into developer workflows, productivity tools, and professional applications. OpenAI's usage composition now sits between Anthropic's tightly focused profile and Google's more diffuse distribution, suggesting a broad base of utility with growing tilt toward high-value, structured tasks.
DeepSeek and Qwen exhibit usage patterns that diverge considerably from the other model families discussed earlier. DeepSeek's token distribution is dominated by roleplay, casual chat, and entertainment-oriented interaction, often accounting for more than two thirds of its total usage. Only a small fraction of activity falls into structured tasks such as programming or science. This pattern reflects DeepSeek's strong consumer orientation and its positioning as a high-engagement conversational model. Notably, DeepSeek displays a modest but steady increase in programming-related usage toward late summer, suggesting incremental adoption in lightweight development workflows.
Qwen, by contrast, presents an almost inverted profile. Across the entire period shown, programming consistently represents 40-60 percent of all tokens, signaling a clear emphasis on technical and developer tasks. Compared with Anthropic's more stable engineering-heavy composition, Qwen demonstrates higher volatility across adjacent categories such as science, technology, and roleplay. These week-to-week shifts imply a heterogeneous user base and rapid iteration in applied use cases. A noticeable rise in roleplay usage during September and October, followed by a contraction in November, hints at evolving user behavior or adjustments in downstream application routing.
In summary, each provider shows a distinct profile aligned with its strategic focus. The differences highlight why no single model or provider covers all use cases optimally; it also underscores the potential benefits of multi-model ecosystem.
Global LLM usage exhibits pronounced regional variation. By examining geographic breakdowns, we can infer how local usage and spend shape LLM usage patterns. While figures below reflect OpenRouter's user base, they offer one snapshot of regional engagements.
The distribution of spend, as shown in the figure below, underscores the increasingly global nature of AI inference market. North America, while still the single largest region, now accounts for less than half of total spend for most of the observed period. Europe shows a stable and durable contribution. Its relative share of weekly spend remains consistent throughout the timeline, typically occupying a band between the mid-teens and low twenties. A notable development is the rise of Asia not only as a producer of frontier models but also as a rapidly expanding consumer. In the earliest weeks of the dataset, Asia represented roughly thirteen percent of global spend. Over time, this share more than doubled, reaching approximately 31% in the most recent period.
As shown in the table above, English dominates usage, accounting for more than 80% of all tokens. This reflects both the prevalence of English-language models and the developer-centric skew of OpenRouter's user base. However, other languages particularly Chinese, Russian, and Spanish, make up a meaningful tail. Simplified Chinese alone accounts for nearly 5% of global tokens, suggesting sustained engagement by users in bilingual or Chinese-first environments, especially given the growth of Chinese OSS models like DeepSeek and Qwen.
For model builders and infrastructure operators, cross-regional usability, across languages, compliance regimes, and deployment settings, is becoming table stakes in a world where LLM adoption is simultaneously global and locally optimized.
Cohort Retention Rates. Retention is measured as activity retention, where users are counted if they return in subsequent months, even after periods of inactivity; as a result, curves may exhibit small non-monotonic bumps.
This collection of retention charts captures the dynamics of the LLM user market across leading models. At first glance, the data is dominated by high churn and rapid cohort decay. Yet beneath this volatility lies a subtler and more consequential signal: a small set of early user cohorts exhibits durable retention over time. We term these foundational cohorts.
These cohorts are not merely early adopters; they represent users whose workloads have achieved a deep and persistent workload–model fit. Once established, this fit creates both economic and cognitive inertia that resists substitution, even as newer models emerge.
We introduce the Cinderella Glass Slipper effect as a framework to describe this phenomenon. The hypothesis posits that in a rapidly evolving AI ecosystem, there exists a latent distribution of high-value workloads that remain unsolved across successive model generations. Each new frontier model is effectively ""tried on"" against these open problems. When a newly released model happens to match a previously unmet technical and economic constraint, it achieves the precise fit — the metaphorical ""glass slipper.""
For the developers or organizations whose workloads finally ""fit,"" this alignment creates strong lock-in effects. Their systems, data pipelines, and user experiences become anchored to the model that solved their problem first. As costs decline and reliability increases, the incentive to re-platform diminishes sharply. Conversely, workloads that do not find such a fit remain exploratory, migrating from one model to another in search of their own solution.
Empirically, this pattern is observable in the June 2025 cohort of Gemini 2.5 Pro and the May 2025 cohort of Claude 4 Sonnet, which retain approximately 40% of users at Month 5, substantially higher than later cohorts. These cohorts appear to correspond to specific technical breakthroughs (e.g., reasoning fidelity or tool-use stability) that finally enabled previously impossible workloads.
In all, rapid capability shifts in foundation models necessitate a redefinition of user retention. Each new model generation introduces a brief opportunity to solve previously unmet workloads. When such alignment occurs, the affected users form foundational cohorts: segments whose retention trajectories remain stable despite subsequent model introductions.
The Dominant Launch Anomaly. The OpenAI GPT-4o Mini chart shows this phenomenon in its extreme. A single foundational cohort (July 2024, orange line) established a dominant, sticky workload-model fit at launch. All subsequent cohorts, which arrived after this fit was established and the market had moved on, behave identically: they churn and cluster at the bottom. This suggests the window to establish this foundational fit is singular and occurs only at the moment a model is perceived as ""frontier.""
The Consequence of No-Fit. The Gemini 2.0 Flash and Llama 4 Maverick charts showcase a cautionary tale of what happens when this initial fit is never established. Unlike the other models, there is no high-performing foundational cohort. Every single cohort performs identically poorly. This suggests that the models were never perceived as a ""frontier"" for a high-value, sticky workload. It launched directly into the good enough market and thus failed to lock in any user base. Similarly, the chaotic charts for DeepSeek, despite overwhelming success overall, struggle to establish a stable, foundational cohort.
Boomerang Effect. The DeepSeek models introduce a more complex pattern. Their retention curves display a highly unusual anomaly: resurrection jumps. Unlike typical, monotonically decreasing retention, several DeepSeek cohorts show a distinct rise in retention after an initial period of churn (e.g., DeepSeek R1's April 2025 cohort around Month 3, and DeepSeek Chat V3-0324's July 2025 cohort around Month 2). This indicates that some churned users are returning to the model. This ""boomerang effect"" suggests these users return to DeepSeek, after trying alternatives and confirming through competitive testing that DeepSeek provides an optimal, and often better fit for their specific workload due to a superior combination of specialized technical performance, cost-efficiency, or other unique features.
Implications. The Glass Slipper phenomenon reframes retention not as an outcome but as a lens for understanding capability breakthroughs. Foundational cohorts are the fingerprints of real technical progress: they mark where an AI model has crossed from novelty into necessity. For builders and investors alike, identifying these cohorts early may be the single most predictive signal of enduring model–market advantage.
The cost of using a model is a key factor influencing user behavior. In this section, we focus on how different AI workload categories distribute across the cost–usage landscape. By examining where categories cluster on log–log cost vs usage plots, we identify patterns in how workloads concentrate in low-cost, high-volume regions versus high-cost, specialized segments. We also reference similarities to the Jevon's paradox effects, in the sense that lower-cost categories often correspond to higher aggregate usage, though we do not attempt to formally analyze the paradox or causality.
The scatter plot above reveals a distinct segmentation of AI use cases, mapping them based on their aggregate usage volume (Total Tokens) against their unit cost (Cost per 1M Tokens). A critical preliminary observation is that both axes are logarithmic. This logarithmic scaling signifies that small visual distances on the chart correspond to substantial multiplicative differences in real-world volume and cost.
The chart is bisected by a vertical line at the median cost of $0.73 per 1M tokens, effectively creating a four-quadrant framework to simplify the AI market across categories.
Note that these end costs differ from advertised list prices. High-frequency workloads benefit from caching, which drives down realized spend and produces materially lower effective prices than those publicly listed. The cost metric shown reflects a blended rate across both prompt and completion tokens, providing a more accurate view of what users actually pay in aggregate. The dataset also excludes BYOK activity to isolate standardized, platform-mediated usage and avoid distortion from custom infrastructure setups.
Premium Workloads (Top-Right): This quadrant contains high-cost, high-usage applications, now including technology and science, positioned right at the intersection. These represent valuable and heavily-used professional workloads where users are willing to pay a premium for performance or specialized capabilities. Technology is a significant outlier, being dramatically more expensive than any other category. This suggests that technology as a use case (perhaps relating to complex system design or architecture) may require far more powerful and expensive models for inference, yet it maintains a high usage volume, indicating its essential nature.
Mass-Market Volume Drivers (Top-Left): This quadrant is defined by high usage and a low, at-or-below-average cost. This area is dominated by two massive use cases: roleplay, programming as well as science.
The sheer scale of these two categories confirms that both professional productivity and conversational entertainment are primary, massive drivers for AI. The cost sensitivity in this quadrant is where, as previously noted, open source models have found a significant edge.
Specialized Experts (Bottom-Right): This quadrant houses lower-volume, high-cost applications, including finance, academia, health, and marketing. These are high-stakes, niche professional domains. The lower aggregate volume is logical, as one might consult an AI for ""health"" or ""finance"" far less frequently than for ""programming."" Users are willing to pay a significant premium for these tasks, likely because the demand for accuracy, reliability, and domain-specific knowledge is extremely high.
Niche Utilities (Bottom-Left): This quadrant features low-cost, low-volume tasks, including translation, legal, and trivia. These are functional, cost-optimized utilities. Translation has the highest volume within this group, while trivia has the lowest. Their low cost and relatively low volume suggest these tasks may be highly optimized, ""solved,"" or commoditized, where good-enough alternative is available cheaply.
As noted, the most significant outlier on this chart is technology. It commands the highest cost-per-token by a substantial margin while maintaining high usage. This strongly suggests a market segment with a high willingness-to-pay for high-value, complex answers (e.g., system architecture, advanced technical problem-solving). One key question is whether this high price is driven by high user value (a ""demand-side"" opportunity) or by a high cost-of-serving (a ""supply-side"" challenge), as these queries may require the most powerful frontier models. The ""play"" to be had in technology is to service this high-value market. A provider who can serve this segment, perhaps through highly, optimized, specialist models, could potentially capture a market with higher margins.
The figure above maps model usage against cost per 1M tokens (log–log scale), revealing weak overall correlation. The x-axis maps out the nominal values for convenience. The trendline is nearly flat, indicating that demand is relatively price-inelastic; a 10% decrease in price corresponds to only about a 0.5–0.7% increase in usage. Yet the dispersion across the chart is substantial, reflecting strong market segmentation. Two distinct regimes appear: proprietary models from OpenAI and Anthropic occupy the high-cost, high-usage zone, while open models like DeepSeek, Mistral, and Qwen populate the low-cost, high-volume zone. This pattern supports a simple heuristic: closed source models capture high value tasks, while open source models capture high volume lower value tasks. The weak price elasticity indicates that even drastic cost differences do not fully shift demand; proprietary providers retain pricing power for mission-critical applications, while open ecosystems absorb volume from cost-sensitive users.
The figure above is similar to the prior figure but displays the model authors. Four usage–cost archetypes emerge. Premium leaders, such as Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Claude Sonnet 4, command costs around $2 per 1M tokens and still reach high usage, suggesting users are willing to pay for superior reasoning and reliability at scale. Efficient giants, like Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash and DeepSeek V3 0324, pair strong performance with prices below $0.40 per 1M tokens and achieve similar usage levels, making them attractive defaults for high-volume or long-context workloads. Long tail models, including Qwen 2 7B Instruct and IBM Granite 4.0 Micro, are priced at just a few cents per 1M tokens yet sit around 10^2.9 in total usage, reflecting constraints from weaker performance, limited visibility, or fewer integrations. Finally, premium specialists, such as OpenAI's GPT-4 and GPT-5 Pro, occupy the high-cost, low-usage quadrant: at roughly $35 per 1M tokens and usage near 10^3.4, they are used sparingly for niche, high-stakes workloads where output quality matters far more than marginal token cost.
Overall, the scatterplot highlights that pricing power in the LLM market is not uniform. While cheaper models can drive scale through efficiency and integration, premium offerings still command strong demand where stakes are high. This fragmentation suggests that the market has not yet commoditized, and that differentiation, whether through latency, context length, or output quality, remains a source of strategic advantage.
These observations suggest the following:
From an operator's standpoint, several strategic patterns emerge. Providers like Google have leaned heavily into tiered offerings (most notably with Gemini Flash and Pro) explicitly trading off speed, cost, and capability. This tiering enables market segmentation by price sensitivity and task criticality: lightweight tasks are routed to cheaper, faster models; premium models serve complex or latency-tolerant workloads. Optimizing for use cases and reliability is often as impactful as ""cutting"" price. A faster, purpose-built model may be preferred over a cheaper but unpredictable one, especially in production settings. This shifts focus from cost-per-token to cost-per-successful-outcome. The relatively flat demand elasticity suggests LLMs are not yet a commodity—many users are willing to pay a premium for quality, capabilities, or stability. Differentiation still holds value, particularly when task outcomes matter more than marginal token savings.
This empirical study offers a data-driven perspective on how LLMs are actually being used, highlighting several themes that nuance the conventional wisdom about AI deployment:
1. A Multi-Model Ecosystem. Our analysis shows that no single model dominates all usage. Instead, we observe a rich multi-model ecosystem with both closed and open models capturing significant shares. For example, even though OpenAI and Anthropic models lead in many programming and knowledge tasks, open source models like DeepSeek and Qwen collectively served a large portion of total tokens (sometimes over 30%). This suggests the future of LLM usage is likely model-agnostic and heterogeneous. For developers, this means maintaining flexibility, integrating multiple models and choosing the best for each job, rather than betting everything on one model's supremacy. For model providers, it underscores that competition can come from unexpected places (e.g., a community model might erode part of your market unless you continuously improve and differentiate).
2. Usage Diversity Beyond Productivity. A surprising finding is the sheer volume of roleplay and entertainment-oriented usage. Over half of open source model usage was for roleplay and storytelling. Even on proprietary platforms, a non-trivial fraction of early ChatGPT use was casual and creative before professional use cases grew. This counters an assumption that LLMs are mostly used for writing code, emails, or summaries. In reality, many users engage with these models for companionship or exploration. This has important implications. It highlights a substantial opportunity for consumer-facing applications that merge narrative design, emotional engagement, and interactivity. It suggests new frontiers for personalization—agents that evolve personalities, remember preferences, or sustain long-form interactions. It also redefines model evaluation metrics: success may depend less on factual accuracy and more on consistency, coherence, and the ability to sustain engaging dialog. Finally, it opens a pathway for crossovers between AI and entertainment IP, with potential in interactive storytelling, gaming, and creator-driven virtual characters.
3. Agents vs Humans: The Rise of Agentic Inference. LLM usage is shifting from single-turn interactions to agentic inference, where models plan, reason, and execute across multiple steps. Rather than producing one-off responses, they now coordinate tool calls, access external data, and iteratively refine outputs to achieve a goal. Early evidence shows rising multi-step queries and chained tool use that we proxy to agentic use. As this paradigm expands, evaluation will move from language quality to task completion and efficiency. The next competitive frontier is how effectively models can perform sustained reasoning, a shift that may ultimately redefine what agentic inference at scale means in practice.
4. Geographic Outlook. LLM usage is becoming increasingly global and decentralized, with rapid growth beyond North America. Asia's share of total token demand has risen from about 13% to 31%, reflecting stronger enterprise adoption and innovation. Meanwhile, China has emerged as a major force, not only through domestic consumption but also by producing globally competitive models. The broader takeaway: LLMs must be globally useful performing well across languages, contexts, and markets. The next phase of competition will hinge on cultural adaptability and multilingual capability, not just model scale.
5. Cost vs. Usage Dynamics. The LLM market does not seem to behave like a commodity just yet: price alone explains little about usage. Users balance cost with reasoning quality, reliability, and breadth of capability. Closed models continue to capture high-value, revenue-linked workloads, while open models dominate lower-cost and high-volume tasks. This creates a dynamic equilibrium—one defined less by stability and more by constant pressure from below. Open source models continuously push the efficient frontier, especially in reasoning and coding domains (e.g. Kimi K2 Thinking) where rapid iteration and OSS innovations narrow the performance gap. Each improvement in open models compresses the pricing power of proprietary systems, forcing them to justify premiums through superior integration, consistency, and enterprise support. The resulting competition is fast-moving, asymmetric, and continuously shifting. Over time, as quality convergence accelerates, price elasticity is likely to increase, turning what was once a differentiated market into a more fluid one.
6. Retention and the Cinderella Glass Slipper Phenomenon. As foundation models advance in leaps, not steps, retention has become the true measure of defensibility. Each breakthrough creates a fleeting launch window where a model can ""fit"" a high-value workload perfectly (the Cinderella Glass Slipper moment) and once users find that fit, they stay. In this paradigm, product-market fit equals workload-model fit: being the first to solve a real pain point drives deep, sticky adoption as users build workflows and habits around that capability. Switching then becomes costly, both technically and behaviorally. For builders and investors, the signal to watch isn't growth but retention curves, namely, the formation of foundational cohorts who stay through model updates. In an increasingly fast-moving market, capturing these important unmet needs early determines who endures after the next capability leap.
Together, LLMs are becoming an essential computational substrate for reasoning-like tasks across domains, from programming to creative writing. As models continue to advance and deployment expands, having accurate insights on real-world usage dynamics will be crucial for making informed decisions. Ways in which people use LLMs do not always align with expectations and vary significantly country by country, state by state, use case by use case. By observing usage at scale, we can ground our understanding of LLM impact in reality, ensuring that subsequent developments, be they technical improvements, product features, or regulations, are aligned with actual usage patterns and needs. We hope this work serves as a foundation for more empirical studies and that it encourages the AI community to continuously measure and learn from real-world usage as we build the next generation of frontier models.
This study reflects patterns observed on a single platform, namely OpenRouter, and over a finite time window, offering only a partial view of the broader ecosystem. Certain dimensions, such as enterprise usage, locally hosted deployments, or closed internal systems, remain outside the scope of our data. Moreover, several of our data analyses rely on proxy measures: for instance, identifying agentic inference through multi-step or tool-invocation calls, or inferring user geography from billing rather than verified location data. As such, the results should be interpreted as indicative behavioral patterns rather than definitive measurements of underlying phenomena.
This study offers an empirical view of how large language models are becoming embedded in the world's computational infrastructure. They are now integral to workflows, applications, and agentic systems, transforming how information is generated, mediated, and consumed.
The past year catalyzed a step change in how the field conceives reasoning. The emergence of o1-class models normalized extended deliberation and tool use, shifting evaluation beyond single-shot benchmarks toward process-based metrics, latency-cost tradeoffs, and success-on-task under orchestration. Reasoning has become a measure of how effectively models can plan and verify to deliver more reliable outcomes.
The data show that the LLM ecosystem is structurally plural. No single model or provider dominates; instead, users select systems along multiple axes such as capability, latency, price, and trust depending on context. This heterogeneity is not a transient phase but a fundamental property of the market. It promotes rapid iteration and reduces systemic dependence on any one model or stack.
Inference itself is also changing. The rise of multi-step and tool-linked interactions signals a shift from static completion to dynamic orchestration. Users are chaining models, APIs, and tools to accomplish compound objectives, giving rise to what can be described as agentic inference. There are many reasons to believe that agentic inference will exceed, if it hasn't already, human inference.
Geographically, the landscape is becoming more distributed. Asian share of usage continues to expand, China specifically has emerged as both a model developer and exporter, illustrated by the rise of players like Moonshot AI, DeepSeek, and Qwen. The success of non-Western open-weight models shows that LLMs are truly global computational resource.
In effect, o1 did not end competition. Far from that. It expanded the design space. The field is moving toward systems thinking instead of monolithic bets, toward instrumentation instead of intuition, and toward empirical usage analytics instead of leaderboard deltas. If the past year demonstrated that agentic inference is viable at scale, the next will focus on operational excellence: measuring real task completion, reducing variance under distribution shifts, and aligning model behavior with the practical demands of production-scale workloads.
This work was made possible by the foundational platform, infrastructure, datasets, and technical vision developed by the OpenRouter team. In particular, Alex Atallah, Chris Clark, Louis Vichy provided the engineering groundwork and architectural direction that enabled the explorations undertaken in this study. Justin Summerville contributed fundamental support across implementation, testing, and experimental refinement. Additional contributions included launch support from Natwar Maheshwari and design edits from Julian Thayn.
Malika Aubakirova (a16z) served as the lead author, responsible for experiment design, implementation, data analysis, and full preparation of the paper. Anjney Midha provided strategic guidance and shaped the overarching framing and direction.
Early exploratory experimentation and system setup were supported by Abhi Desai during his internship at a16z. Rajko Radovanovic and Tyler Burkett, during their full-time tenure at a16z, provided targeted technical insights and practical assistance that strengthened several critical components of the work.
All contributors participated in discussions, provided feedback, and reviewed the final manuscript.
The figures below break down the internal sub-tag structure for the three major domains: roleplay, programming, and technology. Each domain exhibits distinct internal patterns that reveal how users interact with LLMs within these categories.

Listen, man, I know… AirPod Pro 3 are really nice! They work well with Apple products. They have cool features like live translation and an industry-leading heart rate sensor. They’re iconic and minimalist, and they sound pretty good. Yadda, yadda. But if you’re in the market for a pair of wireless earbuds that do one thing well (like playing music), I’m here to tell you that maybe it’s time to look beyond the Apple bubble. Maybe it’s time… for Soundpeats. Yes. Soundpeats.
Soundpeats Air5 Pro+
The Soundpeats Air5 Pro+ sound excellent and have solid ANC, especially for the price.
Pros
Cons
There are so many wireless earbuds in the world nowadays, so which pair you buy will depend largely on, well, you. What do you want? Are you listening to podcasts? Are you trying to translate other languages? Are you gaming? Do you run a lot? Do you want a pair that does your laundry? You’re shit out of luck if the last one is on your “must have” list. But if listening to music is a big one, like it is for most people, then I can say for sure that the $130 Soundpeats Air5 Pro+ are bringing a lot to the table for not a lot of money.
When I put the Air5 Pro+ into my ears, the first thing I noticed was that they’re extremely comfortable. I’m not often hit with the perfect-fit revelation when putting wireless earbuds in my ears, so the experience was immediately welcome. The ear tips are slim enough for a smooth, deeper fit without feeling loose. The result is a pair of wireless earbuds that just drop straight in and then feel snug once they’re there. Obviously, fit is a very personal thing, so your results might not be the same, but if you don’t feel the same as I do, there are three included different sizes: small, medium, and large.
The next thing I noticed (or, next two things, really) is that the Air5 Pro+ are both loud andÂ clear. Driving the volume and clarity (no pun intended) is a hybrid driver setup that combines a 10mm dynamic driver for the low end and a separate xMEMS driver. The latter, I’m fairly certain, is where that extra clarity is coming from. If you’re unfamiliar, MEMS drivers (short for micro-electromechanical systems) are different from other drivers, which typically use magnets.
Instead of using a magnet and coils to create sound, a MEMS driver vibrates a silicon membrane using what’s called the piezoelectric effect (a phenomenon through which materials generate electricity from applied mechanical stress). When the membrane is vibrated, it expands and contracts, generating sound waves. The result is a solid-state driver that has a fast response time and usually equates to more clarity in mid and high frequencies. This is admittedly my first experience with a MEMS driver, and I have to say, the Soundpeats Air5 Pro+ are making me a believer.
The soundstage is spacious, which is to say that all frequencies (mids, highs, and lows) feel distinct from one another and like they have room to breathe. That clarity and nuance translates well across genres, too. Whether I was listening to Herbie Hancock or Steely Dan, the Air5 Pro+ performed. I even tested the wireless earbuds via Spotify on lossless settings (FLAC format) and your typical midrange settings, which are more compressed, and was pleased with both, even if FLAC sounds better.
I felt like the Air5 Pro+ shone particularly bright when listening to older songs with lots of instrumentation. In Neil Young’s “Old Man,” for example, the banjo felt perfectly panned to the left in its intended place in the mix, while the acoustic guitar occupied the right, and the lap steel/piano swooped in intermittently right through the middle. Everything in its place. Lovely.
One particular standout is the low end, which is mainly the responsibility of the 10mm dynamic driver. Maybe it’s because the driver is dedicated mostly to just the bass territory, or maybe Soundpeats just nailed the tuning, but I found the Air5 Pro+ deliver clear and pronounced low end that isn’t overpowering. Obviously, everyone’s preference is different, but I would consider the Air5 Pro+ to have great out-of-the-box tuning that feels suited for lots of different genres. I can say for sure that if fidelity tops your list of things you look for in a pair of wireless earbuds, these should be on your radarâespecially when you consider that for $130, they eclipse competitors like the OnePlus Buds 4 and the Nothing Ear 3 in the sound department by a long shot.
Sound quality is a big part of any pair of wireless earbuds, but it’s not everything. Chances are you’re still going to want important (and increasingly standard) features like active noise cancellation (ANC) in your chosen pair as well. On that front, Soundpeats delivers again. I put the Air5 Pro+ through the obligatory subway test, and they held up. Train noise was mostly blocked out, even at 60% volume.
Whether that noise cancellation is a product of a superior fit (passive noise cancelling) or Soundpeats’ ANC algorithm, the Air5 Pro+ did a better-than-average job of blocking out noise during my commute, both on the street and while riding the train. They’re not my top choice for ANC when it comes to wireless earbuds (that distinction still belongs to Bose and its QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd Gen), but they’re more than solid, especially for the price.
Outside of ANC, the Air5 Pro+ also offer various features through the Soundpeats companion app. I’ve covered those previously in my review of the excellent Clip1 open wireless earbuds, but it bears repeating since the Soundpeats app is solid. It’s all pretty standard stuffâcontrolling the earbuds’ mode (ANC or transparency), adjusting EQ (both preset and custom), and activating features like “game mode,” which reduces latency in audio. There’s also a section for things like white noise if that’s your jam. You could just as easily look up ambient noise on Spotify or YouTube, but if, for whatever reason, you can’tÂ do that, the option is nice to have.
These wireless earbuds also have adaptive EQ, which uses an ear test to adjust the EQ to your specific hearing. Like most tests, Soundpeats’ adaptive EQ feature consists of listening to a tone and then indicating with a tap in the app when you hear it. I took Soundpeats’ test and didn’t find a huge difference, but that could just be a result of the out-of-the-box tuning working well with my particular hearing. If you’re at all interested in getting the most out of your wireless earbuds fidelity-wise, I always recommend taking the included hearing test in your companion app (if there is one).
Like basically every other pair of wireless earbuds, there are touch controls that can trigger things like play or pause, as well as toggling ANC on and off, or track skipping. They work fine. There’s a slight delay between tapping and the command registering, which isn’t ideal, but not enough to drive me mad or make me like the wireless earbuds less.
If there are two things I might deduct some points for, it’s the looks and the battery life. Like the Clip1, I’m not a huge fan of the Soundpeats design language, but everyone’s taste is different, and ultimately, sound and ANC are more important. Battery life, however, is a material category, and the Air5 Pro+ are a little under the average in that department. Soundpeats’ wireless earbuds are rated for 6 hours of battery life in the earbuds themselves at 60% volume while listening in normal mode, which is Soundpeats lingo for “without ANC.” That means you can expect about 5 hours if you’re listening with ANC on, which, in several hours of testing, tracks from my perspective.
That’s not an egregious battery life, but it’s a little underwhelming compared to other wireless earbuds with ANC, which in my experience usually get around 6 to 7 hours outside the case with ANC activated. The case holds about 24 hours of additional battery, which is (again), just okay; total battery life with the case is up to 30 hours, according to Soundpeats.
I’m not here to tell you what to like. Maybe you own a pair of AirPods or Google’s Pixel Buds 2a, and you love them. If that’s the case, then go forth. If you’ve ever wondered if there was more to appreciate in the sound department, though, then Soundpeats and its xMEMS driver might be a great way to find out at a cost that’s not crippling to your wallet.
For $130, the Air5 Pro+ offer great sound, better-than-average ANC, and lots of features. While the look isn’t sleek and the battery life is a little underpowered, they feel like a steal for the money, especially when compared across the aisle to competitors like Nothing and OnePlus, which are solid but still not quite up to Soundpeats’ level. Trust me, they may not have the same recognition, but the sound speaks for itself.

How much do you want to bet that the proliferation of Kalshi is going to make everyone’s lives a little worse? Earlier today, the “prediction market” platform that allows people to “trade contracts” on future events in a way that is somehow legally distinct from gambling announced a partnership with CNN to place odds on everything from elections to the weather. It’s just one part of the company’s apparent plan to, in the words of co-founder and CEO Tarek Mansour, “financialize everything and create a tradable asset out of any difference in opinion.”
Mansour popped up at the Future of Global Markets 2025 conference held by Citadel Securities last month to float the notion that everything can be an asset if you’re willing to put money on itâan idea that doesn’t actually make any sense if you think about it for more than a second. The idea that you can resolve a difference of opinion by turning it into a financial contract where people put money on either side of the outcome isn’t a resolution tool. It is just a bet that Kalshi takes a cut of.
He also pushed this idea that all of the “prediction markets” like to run with, which is the notion that they are providing some sort of clarity on what is happening. “[Prediction markets] do a very, very good job at distilling information and surfacing truth to people,” Mansour told the conference. Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan just ran with this idea the other day during an appearance on 60 Minutes, calling his company’s platform “the most accurate thing we have as mankind right now.” There’s no real evidence of that, nor, frankly, a particularly useful metric for making such a determination.
A prediction market, in theory, is a reflection of the wisdom of crowds. If a contract allows you to purchase a contract for a given outcome for $0.66, the market thinks there is a 66% chance of that outcome being correct. But that’s not a prediction, that’s a probability. The opposite will still happen one out of three times. And the business model for these platforms counts on people betting on both sides of the proposition, which kinda undermines the idea that it’s a pure prediction.
For example, remember on the day of the New York mayoral election when Polymarket accounts started claiming there was a âsurge of whalesâ betting on Andrew Cuomo to win while asking, âDo they know something we donât?â If they care about the predictive nature of the platform, why encourage people to chase the less likely outcome?
None of that seems to concern investors, who simply see the money pouring in and the transaction fees skimmed off the top. Yesterday, Kalshi reported that it raised $1 billion in new financing at an $11 billion valuation. So the people with the money certainly seem to be betting that there are a lot of suckers out there. Feels like they’ll probably win that one.

If your TVâs internal speakers donât offer an immersive sound experience and youâre done rewinding content just to hear what was said, itâs high time you invest in a solid soundbar. The best options out there push audio that surrounds you, plus offer multiple listening modes for different needs, and now is a great time to nab one without shelling out big bucks.
The latest Samsung B-Series soundbar, which comes with a built-in subwoofer, is currently down to just $100 at Amazon, after a nice 29% discount. Youâre saving a nice $40 on it, and itâs also the lowest we have seen it drop to in a long while. Pick yours up fast, because such discounts donât last forever.
See at Amazon
This compact soundbar sits nicely on the console of your TV and is minimal enough to blend into any entertainment setup. Those who prefer a cleaner setup can mount it on the wall just as well. It connects to your display (or other devices) using Bluetooth, so there are no cables or complicated steps to worry about. Once connected, it pushes bold, room-filling sound that surrounds you. It wonât feel like the audio is just being blasted from the speaker, but instead, coming from all corners and every direction. The included subwoofer takes care of the bass, bringing action-packed scenes and even your favorite tunes to life. Watching a classic action movie? Youâll feel like the fights are happening right there in your living room. Planning a horror show night? Be ready for footsteps creeping up from behind, and donât blame us if the entire thing feels a lot more spookier!
Dialogues get a boost, too. It does a good job of picking up on everything thatâs being said, from screams in the Real Housewives to subtle whispers in the Stranger Things. You wonât have to rewind a scene repeatedly anymore. Moreover, sound doesnât distort at higher levels, which is great for when youâre using the soundbar to vibe to your favorite songs. Thereâs also a Do Not Disturb mode built right in, which automatically reduces the volume. This is one ideal for those late-night streaming sessions where you donât want to wake the entire house up.
Setting things up is straightforward, and managing everything is even simpler. The soundbar can be used with your Samsung TV remote, letting you adjust power, volume, and sound effects easily. To get started, put the soundbar in the pairing mode using the input button on it. Then, turn your TV on and head to Settings > Sound > Sound Output > Bluetooth Speaker List. Look for your soundbar in the list, and press Pair and Connect. It should be ready to use within a few minutes! All in all, if youâve been wanting to grab a solid Bluetooth soundbar to enjoy better sound during your favorite movies and series but couldnât pick one up during Black Friday, now is a good time to make the move. This option would normally run you around $140, but you can grab it for just $100 today. Youâll also enjoy free delivery with your purchase. Just note that itâs selling out fast, so the discount, as well as the stock, wonât be around for long. Snap it up quick, because once the deal is gone, it might not come back anytime soon.

Those looking to game better or push some creative boundaries this holiday season; weâve got good news. The top-rated ASUS GeForce RTX 5070 just hit its lowest price ever, and itâs even better than what it dipped to during Black Friday!
This graphics card sits at $710, but you can currently grab it for just $570 at Amazon, after the retailer took 20% off its price. The deal is open to all shoppers, and there are no delivery charges to worry about. Even better, this isnât one of those complicated-to-score discounts. You donât need to enter any complicated coupon codes or follow long checkout steps to grab the discount. Just throw it in your cart, and the offer applies automatically. The only thing to note is that the retailer has marked the deal as a fast-selling one. That means the stock, or the drop itself, is only going to be around for a short time, and it wonât be long before we see them wrap up. Itâs better to act now if you donât want to run into last-minute disappointments later on.

RTX is the most advanced platform for full ray tracing and neural rendering tech that completely upgrades the way you work and play. The graphics card is powered by the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture and DLSS 4, featuring fifth-gen tensor cores for better AI performance, latest streaming multiprocessors that are optimized for neutral shader, and fourth-gen ray tracing cores specifically built for mega geometry. DLSS4 uses AI to boost FPS, reduce latency, and make the overall image quality top-notch, while the Blackwell architecture makes cinematic quality visuals at unbelievable speeds possible.
The 2.5 slot design of the card offers better build compatibility while maintaining cooling performance, regardless of how intense things get. Cooling mechanism includes a premium phase-change GPU thermal pad that softens under heat to fill the gaps between the GPU and thermal module effectively, resulting in superior thermal conductivity and better heat dissipation throughout your sessions. The axial-tech fans come with longer blades, alongside a barrier ring to increase the downward air pressure, while the 0db tech stops the fans automatically when the temperature of the GPU goes 50 degrees. The latter makes it easy to focus on light tasks without any distracting sound, and puts the fans back to work at 55 degrees when things start to heat up. You can also switch between Quiet and Performance BIOS profiles manually; the former offers a calmer operation, while the latter maximizes performance for resource-intensive tasks.
The card comes with a GPU guard that applies adhesive to secure all four corners of the GPU to keep it firmly in place. Dual-ball bearings are designed to last up to twice as long as sleeve bearings, while the protective backplate does a good job of keeping the components safe from external damage. Whatâs more, the Tuning tool makes overclocking, cooling control, and monitoring the performance of your card a breeze. It even comes with MuseTree, which is an AI-powered image-generation app that gives the creative inside you a boost by letting you create images, manage ideas, and unlock new inspirations as you go.
You can now grab the graphics card for just $570, after an impressive $140 discount on its retail price of $710. This makes the upgrade much more affordable, but only for a short time. Donât miss out on the chance to grab it for less, as this is one of the lowest prices we have seen the card drop to.

The US will soon require H-1B visa applicants to make their social-media profiles public so consular officers can review their online activity, a State Department spokesperson told Business Insider.
Beginning December 15, consular officers worldwide will conduct ""online presence reviews"" for all applicants in the H-1B specialty-occupation category, along with their H-4 dependents, the spokesperson said.
The policy, which the department described as part of the Trump administration's focus on ""protecting our nation and our citizens,"" marks one of the broadest expansions of digital vetting ever applied to foreign workers.
Applicants will be instructed to adjust their privacy settings to ""public"" across all social-media platforms, ensuring officers can access posts, networks, employment information, and other digital activity.
The agency already conducts similar reviews for foreign students and exchange visitors in certain categories.
However, the new directive extends this practice to one of the most widely used visa pathways in the US labor market.
""A US visa is a privilege, not a right,"" the spokesperson said. ""In every visa case, we will take the time necessary to ensure an applicant does not pose a risk to the safety and security of the United States.""
The spokesperson declined to comment on reports of an internal State Department cable outlining additional vetting criteria, but confirmed that the new policy will apply globally to applicants ""of all nationalities.""
The move deepens a broader overhaul of the H-1B system under President Donald Trump.
Trump signed an executive order in September imposing a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applications, a move that sent Silicon Valley scrambling and left employers warning foreign workers not to travel.
That policy — aimed at curbing what the administration called ""abuses"" of the system — has been met with confusion, fierce criticism, and an ongoing legal challenge, saying the president lacks authority to impose such fees.
The program allows US employers to hire highly skilled foreign workers in fields such as engineering, software development, biotech, and finance — industries where companies often rely heavily on international talent.
Major firms, including Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Apple, Intel, and Nvidia, collectively sponsor tens of thousands of H-1B roles each year.

A startup that helps brands show up in AI search results and chatbot conversations has raised $4 million in funding.
London-based Azoma aims to capitalize on the rise of generative engine optimization (GEO), a strategy to make content more visible in AI overviews and chatbots like ChatGPT.
""We're helping the world's most recognizable brands to stay relevant in the era of AI search,"" Max Sinclair, the CEO and cofounder of Azoma, told Business Insider.
Azoma, founded in 2022, has developed two patented technologies. One is what it calls a ""digital twin"" to simulate how brands appear in AI chatbot responses. Most conversations with chatbots are private, so Azoma creates profiles of people matching a client's target customer demographic, then uses those to submit a ""very large volume"" of prompts to see what the chatbot says about a brand.
For example, Azoma could send 100,000 prompts asking for the best coffee shop in a city from the profile of a man in his 30s, Sinclair said. Azoma would then assess how its client ranks in those chatbot answers versus its competitors.
Azoma's second solution is generating content, such as product listings, that it says is optimized to appear in AI search results and chatbot answers.
Sinclair said Azoma is a software-as-a-service platform that charges brands on a per-use basis and retailers by product categories. Its clients include the likes of Mars, Colgate, Zappos, and P&G. Azoma achieved profitability earlier this year, Sinclair said.
The GEO and answer engine optimization market is a young and competitive space where the rules are still being written.
Search engine optimization experts from companies like Google and Microsoft previously told Business Insider that some SEO principles still apply to GEO, such as creating relevant content. Sinclair, a former Amazon executive, said he agrees with the top-level principles, but large language models have changed the game.
""The way these LLMs work is totally, totally different. It's a totally new technology,"" Sinclair said. He explained that this is because the number of keywords is much greater in AI search versus traditional search, and because AI has significantly more context about the user.
Investors in the pre-Series A funding round included Ignite Ventures, Rank Ventures, eBay Ventures x Techstars, Twinpath, MaRS ISF, plus angel investors.
Azoma, which was also cofounded by Timur Luguev, who has a Ph.D. in computer science, plans to use the fresh capital to invest in R&D and expand its commercial operations by hiring for sales and customer success roles.
Here's an exclusive look at the 19-page pitch deck Azoma used to raise its $4 million pre-Series AI round.

Year-end hardware shopping delivers the best deals as manufacturers clear remaining inventory to hit annual sales targets before closing the books. This Lenovo V15 G2 laptop is currently at a record low of $599 instead of its typical $2,599 listing, available exclusively through Amazon’s stock rather than Lenovo’s official site.
The configuration packs 32GB DDR4 RAM, a 1TB PCIe SSD, and a 15.6-inch FHD display into a practical business and student laptop that handles everyday computing without breaking your budget. Over 1,000 reviews average 4.5 stars as buyers discover this is solid value for general productivity work, web browsing, and multitasking.
See at Amazon
The 32GB of RAM is a lot for a budget laptop, which is unusual and it lets you keep dozens of browser tabs open along with Office apps, video conferencing software, and background programs without slowing down. Most cheap laptops come with 8GB or 16GB of RAM which means you have to close programs all the time or deal with lag when you switch between tasks.
The 1TB PCIe SSD has enough space for document libraries, photo collections, downloaded media, and application installations without needing external drives or constant cloud management. The PCIe interface makes load times faster than older SATA SSDs which means that Windows boots up in seconds and apps open right away instead of making you wait. The amount of space on the drive is important, especially for students who need to keep their textbooks, lecture recordings, and project files on their own computers, or for business users who need to keep client documents and presentations offline.
The 15.6-inch FHD screen has a resolution of 1920x1080px and makes text look clear enough for long periods of time without straining your eyes. The anti-glare coating also cuts down on reflections from windows or lights above you and the screen quality is good enough for work and media consumption – but it doesn’t pretend to be a display for making content with perfect color accuracy. Dolby Audio speakers make video calls sound clear and YouTube and Netflix sound good enough.
Wi-Fi 6 support means faster wireless speeds and better performance in networks that are crowded with many devices trying to use the same bandwidth. The connectivity options cover practical needs: USB-A ports for older devices, USB-C ports for newer accessories and possible display output, HDMI ports for external monitors or projectors, and an Ethernet jack for wired connections when Wi-Fi isn’t available or isn’t reliable enough.
The Intel Celeron N4500 processor does a good job of handling basic computing tasks and uses very little power, which is good for battery life during classes or meetings when there aren’t any outlets nearby. This chip isn’t good for video editing, 3D rendering, or gaming beyond simple games, but it works fine for web browsing, document editing, video streaming, and communication software.
This $2,000 discount off the normal listing price makes a well-equipped laptop affordable while keeping specs that usually cost $1,000 to $1,200 elsewhere. You get twice as much RAM and storage as most other budget laptops, as well as modern connectivity standards that make the laptop last longer.

I just *know* you've been meaning to re-up on The Pink Stuff.
BuzzFeed Staff
If you’ve got a running mental checklist of boring products you def aren't excited to buy, but do ultimately need, now is as good a time as any to get it done. Below are the basics — like duster sponges, body wash, and dish spray — that aren't fun to buy, but are certainly handy to have around.  
The heavy-duty formula — from small biz Cerama Bryte — works on glass, ceramic, induction, radiant, and halogen stovetops.
Promising review: ""The only way to properly clean a glass cooktop stove and not leave streaks or marks behind. When I first got my new stove, my hard water left marks all over. I tried everything I could think of and even searched the Internet. I was terrified my brand-new stove was ruined. Nothing worked, and then I found this product, and it works like magic. Easy to use. Doesn't take up a lot of storage space. And leaves your stove top looking like it's brand new again. So glad I found this product. Highly recommend."" —Lisa
Get the kit on Amazon for $14.98.
BuzzFeeder Emma Lord is a fan! Here's what she has to say: 
""I bought this after being peer-pressured by all the lovely reviews and I'm happy to report it lives up to the hype. The scent is lovely — it has depth with a hint of floral, but it's light and not at all overpowering. My favorite thing about it is how easily it pairs with other scents, because I am a body mist gremlin who swaps out her scents every day. The lather is also deeply satisfying and I feel quite refreshed and squeaky clean without ever feeling dry.""
Promising review: ""Cremo's body wash is nothing short of exceptional. If you’re a fan of luxurious fragrances, this product will quickly become your new favorite. It boasts an incredible scent that perfectly mimics Baccarat Rouge 540 — a fragrance renowned for its sophisticated and captivating aroma. What sets this body wash apart is not just its stunning scent but also its longevity. The fragrance lingers beautifully throughout the day, ensuring you stay enveloped in that luxurious aroma long after your shower."" —Ralph D. Thompson II
Get it from Amazon for $9.99. 
Promising review: ""I’ve been on the hunt to buy a down pillow like the ones I slept on at the top-rated Loews Hotel in Philly. This is that pillow! I’ve bought pillows online many times, but nothing compares. This is the first pillow I’ve ever bought that didn’t hurt my neck or make me regret spending the money. I will absolutely be ordering another set! Absolutely the comfiest pillow, you won’t regret it. I never write reviews, but just had to because I know the search for pillows is difficult when you can’t feel them. I promise you won’t regret it!"" —Amazon Customer
Get them from Amazon for $41.99+ (available in two sizes; clip the coupon for 20% off this price!)
PS: YouCopia is a woman-owned small business that specializes in home storage solutions.
Promising review: ""I have a bad habit of buying reusable water bottles. This one is cute, this one has this feature, this one has that. What resulted was a cluttered cabinet, a ton of water bottles falling on me every time I went to get one, and I was only using a handful right at the front. This is a great solution! It keeps the cupboard organized, and I can see what I have and quickly grab the bottle I need. As a bonus, it also creates a built-in limitation on how many water bottles I can have at any given time. Really recommend."" —Miki
Get it on Amazon for $24.99+ (available in three sizes).
Promising review: ""These Medicube pads have literally healed my skin. I started using them regularly and noticed such a big difference in how clear and smooth my face looks. They’re gentle but effective, and my skin feels healthier with each use. I love that they’re easy to use and don’t irritate my skin at all. Honestly, they’ve become one of my favorite skincare products and I don’t think I could go without them now."" —demian
Get them from Amazon for $13.90.

And here's what BuzzFeeder/The Pink Stuff fan Heather Braga has to say: 
""After hearing what incredible things The Pink Stuff can do, I finally ordered it and tried it for myself. Honestly, wow! It really does work wonders. I tried it first on my Le Creuset cast-iron pan and was really amazed at how just one pass with The Pink Stuff (and a scouring brush) took off almost every stain! I can't wait to try it on literally everything in my home that needs a deep cleaning.""
Promising review: ""This stuff is absolutely wild. I had been trying to clean my shower/tub forever, because it had a thick layer of caked-on calcium deposits from years of hard water buildup. Last year, I manually scraped every inch of my shower with a razor blade and removed 90% of the film, but there were spots I couldn't reach with the blade and some residual discoloration on the plastic from the previous buildup. I tried my best to remove the rest, but NOTHING worked to polish the shower up, so I just gave up and figured I'd have to live with the permanent staining. Then I found this little bucket of magic. It literally cleaned and polished the shower so well that, if I didn't know any better, I'd assume I had just had a brand-new shower installed. Absolutely bonkers. Honestly, just buy it."" —Mike Harrington
Get it from Amazon for $5.97.
Promising review: ""This floor cleaner is magic. No streaks, and my floors look so good and shiny and clean! I detest mopping, but the end result is worth it!! Don’t hesitate."" —Dean
Get it from Amazon for $6.98.
Mouthwatchers is a small business established by Ronald Plotka, DDS, that specializes in antimicrobial toothbrushes designed to get deeper cleans that even patients with ""great"" dental hygiene might miss with traditional brush and floss routines. 
BuzzFeed Shopping writer Emma Lord says, ""I personally bought this and love it! I use an electric toothbrush usually, but I feel like I'm getting a much more satisfying clean from these?? Especially because I tend to get yellow stains between my teeth no matter *how* much I floss, and these bristles seem to actually target that a lot more effectively.""
Promising review: ""I’m a dental hygienist of 16 years and typically use and recommend electric toothbrushes; however, this manual toothbrush is great! My teeth feel very clean after brushing for two minutes, similar to the way they would feel after using my Oral-B or Sonicare electric toothbrush. I’ll definitely purchase again!"" —Beth
Get a two-pack from Amazon for $5.99. 
Promising review: ""I first ran across the Chopula at a little kitchen store in North Carolina. I was so impressed with all the ways it can be used, I came back to Amazon and ordered another for myself and one each for my kids. I really do love how easy it is to get underneath fried eggs to flip them with this gadget. I had other spatulas, but they always seemed too thick, or they were metal, and I couldn't use them on my nonstick pans. I find myself using it instead of a wooden spoon for a lot of things I stir on the stovetop. You can chop pounds of ground beef with the side of it, too. Nice product for sure!"" —Lois Thurston
Get it from Amazon for $9.99 (available in seven colors).
Check out a TikTok of the foaming pink drain cleaner in action. 
Promising review: ""I’ll admit, I was pretty skeptical when I first bought this product. After months of battling with a stubborn sink that just wouldn’t drain, I had tried everything — and I mean everything — short of calling a plumber. I decided to give Yugou a shot as my last-ditch 'Hail Mary,' and I’m so glad I did! Not only was it incredibly easy to use, but it also worked effectively. I couldn’t believe it. The sink is now flowing and draining better than it ever has before, and dare I say... it was even kind of fun to use! Bonus: It has a lovely, fresh scent that leaves the bathroom smelling great. I’ll definitely be buying more of this magic in a bottle once I’ve finished this review, as it’s also perfect for preventative maintenance. Highly recommend!"" —Janet Anders
Get it from Amazon for $15.98. 
Smartish is a small biz!
Here's what BuzzFeeder Heather Braga has to say: 
""I have this magnetic cable manager and absolutely love it! Cannot tell you how many times my Mac charger would come unplugged and then swiftly fall behind my desk. Then I'd have the annoying task of getting underneath said desk and trying to feed the wire back up to my laptop. Beyond annoying. This has been such a problem-solver! Additionally, Smartish is a small business.""
Promising review: ""I bought one of these for my husband and he ended up using it daily. I ended up ordering one for myself to place on my nightstand and it makes my life a little easier. This would be a great gift for others!"" —Jennifer
Get it from Amazon for $22.99+ (available in two sizes and six colors).
Promising review: ""My skin dries out severely during the winter all the time, and I have to constantly use Vaseline to keep it moisturized (normal cream doesn't work on me). Imagine my surprise when my SO tried to put snail goo on me, eww!! I resisted for weeks, refusing to use this product as she constantly vouched for its abilities. After a month, I finally gave in, and boy, it is amazing! My hands feel more moisturized than ever for longer, and it doesn't leave a disgusting, greasy feel like Vaseline. Take it from a once-non-believer: you have to try this. Even if it doesn't work for you, you paid a fraction of what you would've paid for any other name-brand moisturizers."" —Kyoko Ozaki
Get it from Amazon for $12.98. 
Each pouch of lemon-scented formula gets you four uses. Dump a pack into your disposal (while off at first!), run the water just a bit, and then start it and watch as the blue foam gets to work eliminating odors and loosening up nasties that have been caught down there for who knows how long. 
Promising review: ""These are amazing! I was skeptical at first, but I followed the directions (which are super easy) and was grossed out and satisfied at the same time to see the gunk that was removed. You put the entire packet down your disposal (I read that twice, too) and magic happens in under two minutes! That is what I call powerful and successful cleaning! The scent is super clean and light with a hint of lemon. These will definitely be a cleaning staple for me."" —KPITT
Get a pack of two (eight uses) from Amazon for $11. 
They can be used wet or dry and on virtually every type of flooring and drywall if desired. Since they can be thrown in the wash, one microfiber pad can replace up to 100 single-use pads. 
Promising review: ""These clean like magic! So much better than the wasteful disposable wipes. Another plus: they clean with just water, so no unpleasant artificial 'cleaning' smell."" —Sarah D.
Get a set of two from Amazon for $16.87. 
Avarelle is a small biz!
Promising review: ""While I am an avid fan of using reviews and ratings left by fellow Primers, I am not one to stop and leave a review, but this product and the company truly deserve the acknowledgment. These patches work far better than a wide variety of the name-brand and twice-the-price acne patches. All you have to do is wash your face, apply it to the area as needed, and go to bed! The adhesive keeps it on while the patch works its magic. I love the different sizes, and the results are mind-blowing. I say this as a person who has tried everything from the $20 patches to 99-cent store varieties. Avarelle, you have made a loyal customer for life. You are one in a million. I wish you nothing but success, you are a diamond in the rough."" —Albino&Tamrie
Get a box of 40 round patches for $8.49 or a box of eight extra-large patches for $7, both from Amazon.
To learn more, check out our Avarelle pimple patch deep dive.
Promising review: ""I love how easy these are to use! Once a month, drop this tablet in and let it work its magic. No more stinky water or clothes. Makes everything smell clean!"" —ShoeLover
Get it from Amazon for $6.64+ (available in packs of three, five, or six).
PS: It's also great for eczema, itchy rashes, and skin infections!
Promising review: ""I have ordered this twice now. If my skin is breaking out, I just spray this on after washing my face and let it air dry. It is non-irritating and non-drying. It has a light chlorine smell to me. I can use both morning and night with no irritation. After a few days of this, my skin started clearing up! I put some in a travel spray bottle and take it when I’m flying. My skin always feels dirty on planes, and I spray it on a few times on travel days to freshen my face and hopefully kill some bacteria. It sprays over makeup with no issues."" —SaraSmile11
Get it from Amazon for $17.46. 
Promising review: ""I have tried everything for the bathroom, but this is perfect and cleaned my bathtub like new. All the mold disappeared like magic. Wonderful product. It's a bit expensive, but it smells good and is non-toxic. Would recommend to anyone."" —Tashi Dolma
Get it from Amazon for $20.98 (available in two scents). 
Promising review: ""This scale with a built-in cup is the best thing for my baking tools. No more whipping out 1,000,000 cups. Also, [rather than] always trying to figure out grams or cups, now I just press a button, and it tells me I love this."" —Corin lonigro
Get it from Amazon for $24.98 (available in three colors).
The microfiber dusting head is completely removable and machine-washable.
Promising review: ""This sucker is LOOOONG. It's also short when you need it to be. But its length is one of its greatest assets, being able to reach even those ceiling beams you couldn't reach before. Finally reach the tops of picture frames that are hanging in awkwardly high places. Clean off the poles that extend the drop of the ceiling fans. Dust the corner speakers mounted on the ceiling. This is what I did in no time at all with this duster, and despite nearly two years of web buildup in some high places, I got the whole job done in just a few minutes. Seriously, you can wipe down all the webs that have been built — all without standing directly beneath the duster! The extra length also means no unexpected guests are going to drop down your shirt while you're evicting them. And I'm perfectly okay with that."" —M. C. Payette
Get it from Amazon for $8.99 (also available in a two-pack and a version with extra attachments).
Promising review: ""This smells heavenly!! I wore it today with the Cheirosa 62, and it smells delicious! I already purchased a second bottle for me and one for my daughter because I know it's going viral, and I don't want to run out! It's already hard to find where I am. To me, this is even better than the Vanilla Cashmere, and that's been my absolute favorite so far."" —Heather Mg 
Get it from Amazon for $9.98. 
Check out a TikTok of the Monday Dry Shampoo in action. 
Promising review: ""I was thoroughly impressed with this dry shampoo. It's affordable, effective, and everyone compliments how great I smell when I use it. Two bottles lasted me a few months. It does have a white cast, but that can easily be worked into the hair to become undetectable."" —Meg B. 
Get it from Amazon for $4.67. 
Fellow BuzzFeed Shopping editor Heather Braga is a huge fan of this spray: 
""My 1-year-old is a big ice pop fan, so I've got a long life ahead of me to be filled with stain removal. I held her while she sucked down a red ice pop on a 90-degree day, and naturally, it dripped all over my white tank top (note to self: stop wearing white around these kids). I was actually kind of excited because it meant I got to put my newly purchased bottle of Miss Mouth's Messy Eater Stain Treater Spray to the test! I followed the directions on the bottle that said to dampen the stained area, spray it with the stain remover, then pop it into the washing machine as usual. What do ya know — it really worked! Completely cleared away all the red stains! Not sure what witchcraft has been used to make this product, but I'm here for it."" 
Promising review: ""THIS IS MAGIC! It’s not like the commercials or ads you see, where you spray it and it instantly disappears, but it does work that way. It removed the red spicy ramen stains from a shirt that had already been washed. When I washed the shirt, the stain was still there, and it was a white shirt. Now the shirt is like new. I have also used it on multiple types of fabrics and with various colors; it doesn’t cause fading or discoloration. It removes the stain, even if you don’t see it in the beginning. Once you wash it, it’s gone. It works on food and pet stains. Will be purchasing more. If you have kids, buy this! They also sell travel ones that work amazingly, too! There is no smell like a laundry scent or chemical scent."" —Hailey
Get it from Amazon for $7.97 (available in three sizes and multipacks). 
Promising review: ""We received our delivery this morning at 10, and I have already used it to clean the post-smoothie blender, wash the porch floor, and pretreat grease stains on a load of spotted T-shirts. This stuff is wonderful!"" —desert dweller
And BuzzFeed Shopping editor Elizabeth Lilly says: ""I live in an apartment without a dishwasher, and I honestly use that as an excuse to order takeout food instead of cooking. But, as soon as I got my hands on a bottle of this stuff (regular Dawn is my go-to dish soap, BTW), I put it to use on both a saucepan I used to make homemade enchilada sauce *and* the casserole dish I baked those enchiladas, which had a ton of caked-on food from sitting overnight. It really does work like I say it does! Like, scary well.""
Get it from Amazon for $4.94 (also available in multipacks and an apple scent!).
The color-adaptive formula is designed so that one of four shades will work on any skin tone. 
Promising review: ""Took years off my eyes! This product is so reasonably priced. I came across a TikTok promoting this and decided to take a chance since the price was super reasonable. My eyes looked brighter in a good way, and the concealer worked so well that I felt I looked younger. I got compliments from friends asking what I did differently with my makeup. I recommend it."" —Monica T. 
Get it from Amazon for $6 (available in four shades).
Diatomite stone absorbs water super fast, so no more wet countertops!
Promising review: ""This splash guard is exactly what my kitchen needed! It fits perfectly behind the faucet and instantly absorbs all those annoying drips and splashes that used to pool on the counter. The material is sturdy, dries super quickly, and looks sleek and modern with my kitchen decor. It also helps keep the sink area clean and dry all day. Easy to install and makes a big difference. I highly recommend it for anyone tired of wiping down wet counters."" —Dmathughes
Get it from Amazon for $15.91+ (available in five sizes and three colors).
Promising review: ""I didn’t think disposable face towels would make a big difference in my skincare routine — but now I can’t imagine going back to regular washcloths. These face towelettes are seriously soft, thick, and the perfect size. One sheet easily dries my entire face (and neck!) and they don’t tear or pill like some cheaper versions I’ve tried. I originally bought them because I have sensitive skin and was breaking out more than usual. Turns out, reusing regular towels was part of the problem. These towels are ultra-hygienic, and I love that I can use a fresh one each day, especially after cleansing or masking. They’re gentle enough that I’ve even used them around my eyes with no irritation. They’re also incredibly versatile — I’ve used them dry to pat my face, dampened them to remove makeup, and even used one as a quick baby wipe in a pinch. And with 50 in a pack, I feel like I’m getting great value for the price."" —Tia Stevens
Get them from Amazon for $9.99 for a 50-count (also available in packs of two, three, four, and six).
Promising review: ""I have super frizzy, curly hair and live in New England, where we have super humid summers. I have been struggling to find a product that de-frizzes my hair without making it look oiled down, and this is it. I put it in my wet hair after washing, towel-dried, and put my hair in a ponytail to go to work. My hair was frizz-free all night — even working outside in high humidity. People even asked if I did something to my hair! This is an amazing product for the price. Absolutely buying again and would recommend to anyone with a frizz issue."" —Marissa 
Get it from Amazon for $4.20. 
Promising review: ""AMAZING! Seriously, amazing. I live in southern NM, and we've had massive dust storms for several weeks now. This cleans like magic. Wet it, squeeze it out, sweep it across the baseboards and other places where a lot of dust has accumulated. Like magic! This tool can make your job very quick."" —Cherie M. Mcginn
Get it from Amazon for $7.99+ (available in packs of two, four, and eight and in five colors).
Prep'd, the small biz that created these handy dividers, was founded in 2015 by two industrial engineers who believed cooking should be simple, easy, and ultimately fun. 
Promising review: ""These are great for so many reasons. We're in a mixed gluten household (one person has celiac and is diabetic, but we are not all doing a gluten-free diet). We can portion control for carb counting and separate out gluten-free vs. non-gluten-free on one pan. Plus, cleanup is just throwing in the dishwasher!"" —J Fans
Get a set of four from Amazon for $24.99.
Promising review: ""I bought these last month to see if I would like them. They are my 32,393,657,697,047,241st product I have purchased for stainless steel in my kitchen. Hahahahaa, not really, but I know I have bought over 100 products, and none ever do what they say they will. ENTER WEIMAN STAINLESS STEEL CLEANER WIPES! This product is EVERYTHING and more. I have no streaks, no hand prints, just gorgeous, shiny, and clean stainless steel. You have made my life so much easier with these wipes. I am so thankful I found this product. Just wipe on and shine off with a cotton cloth. Easy peasy and lasts for the whole week in my heavily used kitchen because I cook every single day. So thankful. You will love these, I promise you. This is not a gimmick product, it's the REAL DEAL! Buy them and you will be as happy as me and your kitchen will look stunning."" —jaguar

Space-saving furniture, sneaky storage helpers, and other ingenious products that make a BIG difference.
BuzzFeed Staff
If your place currently feels more like a walk-in closet than an apartment, a small space makeover may just help you reclaim some breathing room. Below, we've got clever do-it-all solutions — think foldable wall-mounted desk setups, 4-in-1 convertible sofa beds, lift-top tables, and more — that actually fit your life. 
The manufacturer notes that the sofa bed has a weight limit of 350 pounds.
Promising review: ""I ABSOLUTELY love this sofa bed. The functionality of it works great in the space I purchased it for. It is super comfortable and sturdy. As a plus-sized woman, I am often wary of furniture that has a weight limit. However, this folding ottoman beat all expectations! It provides great support, even when fully flattened into a bed. I love how versatile it is and how easily it transitions from one position to the next. It looks great in my space and offers additional seating when others are in my room. Highly recommend!!!"" —Sabb

The other half of the table also lifts to reveal storage space!
Promising review: ""Love this thing! Easy to assemble; it just takes a while. Very functional for me, as I can watch TV while I work. Good quality."" —Tiffany C.
Get it from Amazon for $149.98 (available in two finishes).
Promising review: ""So happy with this table. It’s larger than I had anticipated, which is great. Takes some time to assemble, but it's totally worth it. In an NYC apartment, everyone appreciates furniture that can fold up and be neatly tucked away in a corner. It also arrived two weeks early, which was great!"" —Amber Martin
Get it from Amazon for $80 (available in three finishes).
FYI, the curtain has nine mesh pockets, which are able to hold items up to 1 pound each, so just don't go throwing a mega-size conditioner in there, okay?
Promising review: ""This is the perfect solution for my tub/shower situation. We have no shelving, and shower head racks tend to get rusty/caked with soap and have even fallen off. We've had this in the shower for three months now and it's great. It holds all our bottles, razors, and bars of soap."" —Rachel B

Promising review: ""BEST MONEY YOU WILL SPEND ON AMAZON. I have a VERY small kitchen with limited counter space, so I am always looking for ways to maximize room. STURDY is an understatement. I store five of my cutting boards and three metal trays on this, and it is not budging. I mounted it to the side of my fridge, and when I say it's not moving... IT'S NOT MOVING. I've slammed the fridge and freezer doors, tried pulling on the rails, and NOTHING is moving or falling out. It's CAKE to assemble and free up space behind my knife block, so I have more counter space and don't have to worry about all the cutting boards falling when I grab a knife. 10/10, would buy again!"" —Connie Howbert

Promising review: ""Love this little shoe storage system. Fits 6+ pairs of shoes, and with 6 inches of depth, it fits perfectly in tight spaces or behind doors.

Promising review: ""A while ago, I purchased a seven-piece sectional modular sofa from Belffin in gray velvet. I couldn’t be happier: its styling is minimalist, its look is modern and sleek, and its comfort and functionality are high quality. And you can align these any way you want. Moreover, it’s smaller and more dainty, so it fits perfectly in our family room. I’ve just added two ottomans to my set. So, now I have a family room that comfortably and elegantly accommodates up to 9 people. Like the other sofa sections, these square-sized Ottomans come with impressive storage spaces under the seat cushions (approximately 21.5 x 21.5 x 6.5 inches) that we use to store board games and puzzles. Very ingenious. If you prefer, they can be linked together with a nifty connector accessory that is easy to install or remove, depending on the alignment you want for your sofa or ottoman sections."" —Juan Lulli

The wall-mounted unit includes a six-track wooden shelf (so you can place lids vertically) and six swiveling hooks for hanging pots and pans. Once securely attached to the wall, the organizer can hold up to 30 pounds. 
Promising review: ""Easily my favorite kitchen item. I have a tiny kitchen that only has two cabinets for storage, so my oven was my storage for pots and pans until I bought this. Now, I don't have to pull eight items out of my oven just to preheat and bake something. Installation was easy, took about 10 minutes. It's easy to pull the hooks up and move them when you decide you want them somewhere else, and you can store lids or stock pots or other items on the shelf above the pots. Love, love, love this pot rack."" —Patricia R.

Promising review: ""I love this couch cup holder tray. I made a small, portable office in my bedroom. I often work from the bed so I can keep my feet raised to prevent my ankles from swelling. I put the couch cup holder tray on the bed next to me, and keep the TV remote, my tablet, my drink, and other items in it for easy access. I have moved all over to see if the tray would tip, but no tipping occurred. (Note: I have a firm memory foam mattress.) It is sturdy, easy to clean, and doesn’t tip over when you move around. Because of its size, you can use it anywhere… like on the couch, or when you are outside sunbathing or working on the deck/porch. It is a good buy for the price!"" —Amazon Customer

Promising review: ""I’ve owned more bed frames than I care to admit, but this one is a total game-changer. First, the assembly was painless — I put it together in under 1.5 hours with just the included tools and my questionable sense of direction. The bed feels rock-solid, no squeaks or wobbles even after a few weeks of use. The real MVP here is the storage space. The lift-up storage option is ideal — it lifts up super easily and holds way more than I expected — extra bedding, off-season clothes, Legos, or even a secret snack stash. This bed is designed to be used without a box spring. We went with a 12-inch mattress, and the height is perfect. The fabric sides and headboard look sleek and high-end. If you want a sturdy bed that doubles as a closet without breaking the bank, this is it. I’m actually planning to get this bed for our other kids…. and that’s saying something."" —StephMW

Once this arrived and was put together, my bathroom suddenly became more functional and attractive! We use the top to hold our toiletries, such as toothbrushes, hairbrushes, and other styling tools. The shelf below holds litter-specific things, such as poo bags, a scooper, and a small handheld brush for sweeping out any litter that managed to sneak out of the actual box inside.

It's very well-designed in terms of stability, so as long as you obviously put your heavier items along the perimeter, it's super sturdy. I'm moving, and there is no sink space at the new place, so this is simply a godsend (especially with the hot flat iron issue and not wanting to burn the sink).

58,2025-12-04,"The legal fight between OpenAI and iyO took another turn, following a decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Here are the details.
Earlier this year, as soon as OpenAI announced that it had acquired Jony Ive’s io company, iyO. Inc. filed a lawsuit over alleged trademark infringement.
In the days that followed, multiple documents were made public and revealed interesting details, including the fact that iyO CEO Jason Rugolo had tried to hire Evans Hankey while she was still Apple’s VP of Industrial Design, and before she joined Ive’s venture.
The documents also showed that Ive and Altman decided on the name io in mid-2023, and that Rugolo approached Altman in early 2025 seeking funding for a project regarding “the future of human-computer interface”.
At the time, Altman declined the offer, revealing that he was working on “something competitive,” to which Rugolo replied “ruh roh. / want to work together?”
So when iyO sued, claiming that OpenAI was about to enter its market under a similar name and with similar products to its planned AI-powered in-ear headphones, OpenAI countered.
The company stated that io’s first product wouldn’t be an in-ear headphone, nor a wearable, and that Rugolo had not only volunteered unrequested information about his company, but had also suggested OpenAI acquire ioY for $200 million.
Back then, the court initially sided with iyO, and issued a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), blocking OpenAI from using the io branding. At the time, OpenAI removed the partnership announcement video, as well as mentions of io on its website.
Following this decision, OpenAI appealed to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which brings us to the new decision.
On Wednesday, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the TRO, which means that OpenAI is still blocked from using the io branding to market upcoming products that may be similar to iyO’s.
Per iyO’s press release, the court validated iyO’s complaints over:
With the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals’ decision, the case will likely continue in the district court for a Preliminary Injunction hearing, which will either leave the restrictions in place, narrow them, or expand them.
Just don’t expect this to be over quickly. After the court issued the TRO, the Preliminary Injunction was scheduled for April 2026, with fact and expert discovery, dispositive motions, and a jury trial running through 2027 and 2028.

Even Black Friday and Cyber Week deals tend to give the greatest discounts to the one-gen-behind tech devices while keeping the markdowns on the newest releases far more modest. And when a brand-new device does get a big splashy deal, it’s almost always shortlived.
Yet here we are nearly a week after Black Friday, and one of Apple’s newest smartwatches is still sitting under $200 at Amazon. That’s the 40mm Apple Watch SE 3, which is still $50 below its usual price despite being barely three months old. There’s no catch, no hidden “refurbished” language, or anything else that would give you pause before cashing in and upgrading your exercise tracking, sleep monitoring, and overall smartwatch game for under $200.
See at Amazon
At $200 and with the sturdy construction that Apple puts into all of its smartwatches, the Apple Watch SE 3 is in a unique position where it can be either an upgraded watch for someone with an older model, or an ideal first smartwatch for a younger user. The Apple Watch For Your Kids feature is easily set up on the SE 3, and it lets the wearer call, text, and share their location even if they don’t have an iPhone. They’ll benefit from the all-day 18-hour battery life and rapid recharging just as much as adult wearers, if not more.
As an upgrade on an older smartwatch, the SE 3 brings a wide array of advanced features, most notably in the health and sleep monitoring and tracking departments. The SE 3 monitors the quality and duration of your sleep and gives you an overall sleep score so you can work to maintain or improve it. The smartwatch also gives you alerts if it detects possible sleep apnea, which could give you early detection of a potentially life-threatening condition and allow you to seek treatment.
All of the workout tracking, activity rings, seamless sync of data with an iPhone, and other advanced features that have established the Apple Watch as one of the preeminent health-oriented smartwatches on the market, are present in the SE 3, and in their most recent and advanced forms.
The many great features and visuals of the Apple Watch SE 3 are always at the ready, thanks to the 1,000 nits of brightness that come from the OLED Retina display. It also now features Always-On display mode, so you can look down at any time during your workout or run and see your running pace or heart rate, or your text messages and incoming calls.
The 40mm GPS model of the Apple Watch SE 3 continues to defy convention during the holiday shopping season, first by getting a fat $50 price break, and now by keeping it well past Black Friday. This 20% off deal at Amazon is still going strong, but who knows for how long?

Forbes Staff.
Oracle chairman Larry Ellison became the world’s second-richest person Thursday, reclaiming the rank from Google cofounder Larry Page as a weekslong rally for Google parent firm Alphabet’s stock cooled. 
Oracle’s shares rose 2% to around $212 as of around 12:35 p.m. EST, adding to a 3.3% gain on Wednesday after the company announced Tuesday it would release its second-quarter results on Dec. 10. 
Shares of Alphabet fell 1% to just over $316, paring earlier gains after the stock surged 84% from Aug. 1 to Sept. 10, when it reached an all-time high of $345.72.
Market indexes were largely flat as of early afternoon. 
Ellison's estimated net worth grew to $264.8 billion, following a $5.2 billion increase Thursday. He ranks ahead of Page, whose fortune is estimated at $259.7 billion after a $2.4 billion dip. Fellow Google cofounder Sergey Brin, who bumped Ellison last week to become the world’s third-richest person, now ranks fifth with a net worth estimated at $239.6 billion. Brin falls behind No. 4 Jeff Bezos, whose fortune is estimated at $239.8 billion. Tesla CEO Elon Musk remains the world’s richest person—by far—with a net worth of about $493.6 billion. "

70,2025-12-04,"Geopolitical issues between China and the U.S. Trump administration have caused Xbox and other types of gaming hardware to explode in price. Vietnam is part of the solution. 

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Whether it's Xbox stock supply issues or tariffs triggering price hikes, Xbox Series X|S hardware can't catch a break.
When the United States President Trump kicked off a trade war with China, it caused massive price increases across a variety of products. One business particularly hard hit has been video game consoles — which do not enjoy the same exemptions as other electronics. The United States exempted Apple's iPhones from tariffs for example to protect one of its top national tech businesses. But, it did not extend the same courtesy to the only U.S.-based console player still going: good old Xbox.
Since the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S launch, Microsoft was strong out of the gate, even beating the PlayStation 5 in U.S. dollar sales (via The Verge and Circana) for a few months. But then, PS5 supplies began surging ahead. Xbox hasn't been able to keep up ever since, with hardware declines posted nearly every quarter for the past couple of years. To make matters worse, it was forced to raise prices a few months ago, making the Xbox Series X, and in some cases, the less powerful Xbox Series S more expensive than some PS5 models. Tariffs have played a huge part in making Xbox Series X|S less competitive.
To avoid these types of price increases, manufacturers like Sony PlayStation and Nintendo have moved some of their hardware production out of China, which has been disproportionately targeted in Trump's tariff blitz. One country that has benefitted from this is Vietnam, which has increasingly started to assert its position in all types of electronics manufacturing. The country can now count Xbox among those.
 



In a new report from Reuters, electronics manufacturing heavyweights Foxconn and Luxshare have submitted planning proposals to local authorities, aimed specifically at growing their video game console footprint.
Fushan Technology, part of Foxconn, is seeking production permits specifically for Microsoft Xbox gaming devices, the report claims. Fushan aims to scale up to 4.8 million additional Xbox gaming devices as part of the permit, which likely includes Xbox Series X|S consoles, official Xbox controllers, accessories like the official Xbox headset, and possibly even Xbox Cloud Gaming server tech. Do note that this wouldn't include the Xbox Ally handheld — which is produced by ASUS, not Microsoft, despite the branding. China's Luxshare-ICT has also posted proposals to expand its own console manufacturing operation by an additional 4.5 million units per year.
Microsoft has been dividing its Xbox Series X silicon between retail Xbox Series X consoles and Xbox Cloud Gaming servers as it expands capacity in countries like Brazil and India, which also suffer disproportionately from tariffs and taxes inflating Xbox local hardware prices. Microsoft recently said its Xbox Cloud Gaming use had seen a 45% growth rate year-over-year, even as Xbox Series X|S supplies decline.
All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.
One thing I am constantly asked about on social media is whether or not Xbox is ""exiting"" console hardware. Microsoft has reiterated plans to build a next-gen Xbox console, which is set to be more PC-like than ever with the capability to run Steam and other Windows PC apps and gaming platforms. Another reason people often think Xbox is leaving hardware is Xbox Series X|S stock supplies, which are often difficult to find stocked up in some regions.
Indeed, Microsoft didn't do any Xbox Series X|S deals for Black Friday and Cyber Monday, owing to the stock shortage. Diversifying its supply chain will hopefully help boost Xbox Series X|S production in what could be a pretty huge year for the platform. Although, DRAM supply constraints and price hikes into 2026 could frustrate those efforts for everyone involved.
RELATED: Is this a new Xbox dashboard? 🤔
For millions of Xbox users still on Xbox One X and Xbox One S consoles — Grand Theft Auto 6 will likely catalyse upgrades in a way not seen since the Xbox Series X|S launched in 2020.
Microsoft can't afford to not have stock available for this rare gaming event, particularly since Grand Theft Auto 6 will be available only on Xbox Series X|S and PS5 at launch. Xbox Series S could be the ""cheapest"" way to access the game — but only if you can actually find one to purchase.
Xbox Game Pass Ultimate got a big price hike a few months back, costing $30 a month. Amazon is still selling one month playtime cards at $20 a month however, meaning you can stock up ahead of the price hike. Xbox Cloud Gaming premium quality, hundreds of games including Call of Duty, and other perks await.

Ahead, you’ll find comfy outfits, sand-taming helpers, and heat-proof gadgets that make soaking up every sunny moment way simpler.
Promising review: ""I cannot tell you how much I LOVE these things. I had been using a cheaper pair of pasties, and these are a world apart from those. They cover everything really well and are super comfortable. I literally forget that they are on. I have worn them under really thin white shirts, and you can’t see anything! I LOVE THESE SO MUCH. So much that I just bought another pair so that I’ll never be without."" —Sara Reiland
Get them from Amazon for $28.50 (available in five colors and two sizes). 
The formula is also fragrance- and oxybenzone-free.

Promising review: ""I've gone through several sunscreens to wear with makeup, and this has been the best for me. I'm a simple girl. I apply this with vitamin C cream, let it absorb, then apply my It Cosmetics CC cream. It acts like a primer for me, and my CC glides nicely over it, no pilling, no heavy or cakey feeling. It's def lightweight but provides great protection."" —Emily Haynes 
Get it from Amazon for $14.89.

Promising review: ""NO WHITE CAST! I've been looking for a stick sunscreen and this was just exactly what was needed!! I'm a medium-toned Black woman and looking for something without a white cast is always a challenge. I have applied it on my bare skin and there isn't a white cast at all! It's a 'soft matte' finish, for sure, and looks like natural skin. Like you're not wearing anything at all."" —Martina
Get it from Amazon for $18.99 (also available in a pack of two).
Promising review: ""Love these!!! Super flowy, lightweight, and surprisingly well fit. They wash and dry incredibly well, no wrinkles after drying. I’m planning on buying more."" —PBMC

It fits any phone up to 100mm x 170mm (or about 3.9 inches x 6.7 inches). It's also a great fix for keeping out sand and dirt (and a great option for runners if you're caught in the rain but still want to be able to toggle through your music options). 
See why BuzzFeeder Elizabeth Lilly loves it here!
Promising review: ""I took this on a cruise with me to Honduras, Mexico, and Belize, and it held up perfectly! I was so scared to put this in the water for the first time (after testing it, of course), but it proved to work very well! In fact, I ended up just using it as a carrying case for my room key and phone throughout the cruise! I took it with me snorkeling along the barrier reef in Belize, and I got so many wonderful pictures and videos underwater!"" —GWinSD
Get it from Amazon for $6.99 (available in 14 colors).
Bumkins is a small business that has been designing responsibly made baby products for over 30 years.  
Promising review: ""I bought this to hold wet bathing suits and towels while traveling. It really got tested when I had a mishap getting on a catamaran from a beach, and I had to swim back to shore with my bag of stuff. The clothing and phone that were inside this wet bag stayed dry! I just wish I'd had my towel packed inside it, too."" —PCreative
Get it from Amazon for $11.95 (available in dozens of designs). 
Promising review: ""Perfect hat for Disney World! I wore it every day for 2 weeks and it held up beautifully! It also helped drastically in the Florida heat! Kept me shaded and was very lightweight, so that my head didn’t feel all sweaty like normal hats. Highly recommend!!"" —DS Hensen
Get it from Amazon for $26.99+ (available in women's sizes M–XL and in eight colors).
The Fileist is a Los Angeles-based, woman-owned small biz creating fashionable yet functional accessories designed to make your life just a bit easier.
Promising review: ""Love! Love! Love it! Very sturdy grip and fashionable! I have had skin cancer numerous times, including melanoma. This is a must-have to keep me safe and fashionable — vacation or otherwise. I have thrown it in the overhead on a plane or shuffled through crowded venues prior to COVID-19 and never lost my hat. This is a great gift, first to myself and now to others! Thank you for keeping me safe and on point at an affordable price!"" —Emily K. 
Get it from The Fileist for $55+ (available in dozens of styles and colors).
The waterproof patches last 12 hours or through six applications of sunscreen — whichever comes first. When purple, it's time to reapply, and when clear, you're good to go! 
Promising review: ""I am very sensitive to UV rays and I burn very easily. Discovering these UV stickers was the best thing that ever happened to my vacations. They take the guesswork out of knowing when to reapply your sunblock, helping you stay burn-free without watching the clock and doing math. These work with both lotion and spray-on sunscreen. One sticker works all day long and doesn't come off while you are out having fun."" —Rachel W.

Here's what BuzzFeeder Elizabeth Lilly has to say:
""I own this and use it ALL the time. It comes in handy in a variety of situations at home *and* while traveling — especially when you're sitting in a stuffy plane in Miami in July with the doors open, waiting for the pilot to board and take off. I def got some jealous side-eyes from other passengers as I kept myself cool with this.""
Promising reviews: ""I ordered several to take on a cruise and give as gifts. Waiting in line on a 92-degree August afternoon to board a huge cruise ship, I was glad I had charged my device ahead of time! Got lots of envious looks and referred folks to Amazon for these treasures."" 😎 —SK @ the beach
""Not only are they great for cooling down, but if you suddenly find yourself with a dead battery on your phone, they become a mini charger. You just have to have a cord. And they have a flashlight! These were super handy on our cruise. Easy to store in my crossbody bag and we were all thankful for them during the heat of the day."" —Blu Kerry 
Get it from Amazon for $15.29+ (available in four colors). 
Megababe is a woman-owned small business from entrepreneur, body acceptance advocate, and influencer Katie Sturino. 
Promising review: ""A must-have for summer. Any thicc thigh folks will know that the summer can be tough. I saw this on TikTok and gave it a shot. It's perfect with shorts or a dress on the inner thighs. I've heard of people with other bodily chafing issues using it on those parts of their body with success."" —Faith
Get it from Megababe on Amazon for $13.95. 
PS: SafeGo is a small biz. 
Promising review: ""Bought it for an overseas trip, and it worked great. We used it both in a hotel room when the room safe was out of order and on the beach. I look forward to using it on outings this summer, and I think it will be a very useful addition to my travel staples. I packed in my luggage full of toiletries and sunscreen, so it didn't feel like it took up a ton of space and I could carry it in my purse/tote without it feeling too bulky. That said, you can fit a lot into it."" —laurel
Get it from Amazon for $39.95+ (available in four colors). 
The Ring Thing comes from BringThings, Inc., a woman-owned company dedicated to making ""stylish, functional products."" They donate a portion of each sale to anti-human trafficking non-profits.
Promising review: ""I take my wedding ring off at night when I go to bed. When I’m at home, I put it in a ring dish. But whenever I am traveling, I’m always afraid that I might forget it or it might get knocked onto the floor, and I won’t be able to find it. So this works perfectly for me. Since it has a clip on it, I attach it inside my bathroom bag, and the problem is solved. My rings are safe and secure and won’t be forgotten."" —CG
Get it from Amazon for $19.95 (available in nine colors).
Reviewers recommend that if you're between sizes, size up!
Promising review: ""This suit is so pretty! I was nervous that, for the price, it would be poor quality, but it looks just like the photos. The material is nice and thick, and I love that it’s padded. I’m between a small and medium, so I sized up based on other reviews."" —Morgan Meldrum
Get it from Amazon for $35.99 (available in women's sizes 2–14 and seven styles). 
Promising reviews: ""These sandals are incredibly comfortable. I purchased them for a trip where we’ll be doing a lot of walking and these are perfect. Very secure on my feet, no sliding, the straps do not rub or irritate my skin."" —Jordan Lombardi
""My partner and I bought a pair for a 7-day cruise to the Caribbean. They were perfect for daily walking, excursions, and the beach. They were comfortable, easy to dry off/clean, and matched well with outfits. We did size down as the reviews suggested, and they fit perfectly."" —Amazon Customer
Get them from Amazon for $37.10+ (available in women's sizes 5–14 and in 20 colors).
Promising review: ""I have had these for a while before writing my review. I wanted to use them several times first. So far, I've used them for my travels both summer and winter — they pack easily and are super comfy. Every time I've worn them, I receive compliments on how cute they are. I was REALLY pleased with them when I visited Chico Hot Springs in Montana last year. It was so NICE to slip into these water shoes and NOT have to walk all the way across the COLD tiles and metal stairs to the motel building! I've laundered them when I've returned home — always allowing them to air dry — and placed them back in my suitcase so they're ready for my next trip!"" —Rick Abbott

BTW, Shakalo is a small business based in San Diego.
BuzzFeed Shopping editor Sally Elshorafa lives by the beach (lucky duck!) and used it on herself and her toddler. She says, ""It's actually shocking how well it worked. No sand was on our legs, arms, or tummies after I used it. A miracle product.""
Promising review: ""We recently moved to a beach area, and we are constantly there. This item has changed our entire lives! It lasts decently long (depending on how much you use it), it smells super good (not at all like baby powder), and it's super effective. It has saved me from vacuuming my car at least 1–2 times a week. And I even use it on my dog's paws and bellies to make sure they're taken care of too. I will definitely be buying the refill & another baggie to have exclusively in the car."" —Gabbs Uresti
Get it from Amazon for $24.99. 
Promising review:  ""Girlfriend and I bought these for traveling, and used them at the Newark Airport to sleep for several hours on a layover! Getting them inflated took some time, but overall, we loved these! Packed easily in our carry-on packs, super comfortable, and saved us the cost of a hotel in NYC on St. Patrick's weekend! Will be using them again this summer on our trip to Europe! They have already paid for themselves five or six times over!"" —Jesse Flegal
Get it from Amazon for $33.92+ (available in 16 colors/prints).
BuzzFeed shopping editor Elizabeth Lilly (pictured above on the right!) has this set and says: 
""I've worn it many times, both while traveling and at home in NYC, including to a sweltering Yankees baseball game, a long (also sweltering) weekend in Lisbon, as a cover-up on a Caribbean cruise, and more recently to Boquete, Panama!""
Promising review: ""I got so many compliments when wearing this set on vacation in Hawaii! The top is very comfortable and cropped at just the right length. The shorts were a little see-through, but for the price, they were very comfortable."" —Courtney Smith
Get it from Amazon for $31.34+ (available in women's sizes XS–XL and in 13 colors/patterns). 
Fomin is a small biz!
Promising review: ""These are great for travel. Throw them in your purse or travel bag, or pack them with your toiletries. Lots of great uses. Don’t take up space, don’t count as a liquid, and WORK. Like them a lot."" —Lloyd
Get a box of 15 from Amazon for $8.99+ (available in four scents or a variety pack).
Promising reviews: ""Have this skort in a few different colors. Love it! Thin, comfortable, and true to size. The shorts underneath have pockets, which is great. They have so many colors to choose fro,m will definitely be ordering more."" —Sam
""This skirt is incredibly comfortable! The fabric is lightweight and breathable, making it perfect for any physical activity. The built-in shorts provide extra coverage and support, ensuring I can move freely without any worries. The built-in shorts are a game-changer. They stay in place and prevent any chafing, which is a huge plus during intense workouts. The addition of pockets is fantastic — they are spacious enough to hold essentials like my phone, keys, or even a small wallet. It’s so convenient not having to carry a bag! This skirt is perfect for a wide range of activities. I’ve worn it for running, yoga, tennis, and even just running errands. It transitions seamlessly from workout wear to casual wear, making it a versatile addition to my wardrobe."" —Jackie
Get it from Amazon for $14.99 (available in women's sizes XS–XXL and in 32 colors/prints).
The pouch comes in two different sizes. The medium fits iPhone minis 10–15, 11–15 Pro, and the Galaxy22, while the large fits iPhone Plus/+/Max/11 and Galaxy Plus/Ultra. 
Promising review: ""Works like a charm. Put your phone in the case and leave it in your car on a hot day, and it works great. Large size fits my phone, and its charging case. A little pricey but a good product."" —AllyBe
Get it from Amazon for $39.97+ (available in two sizes and eight styles). 
Promising review: ""I have very fair skin, four children, and love my two-week beach vacation every summer, so we go through a LOT of sunscreen. Having a stick for faces is essential to avoid burning eyes while on the beach or in the pool. This is the best sunblock stick I have ever used. It goes on and blends so easily and doesn’t leave any white marks like some other brands. This will be my go-to stick from here on out!"" —Heather Rink
Get it from Amazon for $9.83.
I know Birkenstocks are expensive, but they really do last forever (mine average three years with near-CONSTANT wear), and once they're broken in, they're incredibly comfortable. I've worn them everywhere — including up and down the hills of Positano, at the beach in Jamaica, through old towns in Montenegro, etc., etc. — and they haven't done me wrong. Living in the northeast, they're also what I wear 90% of the time come spring and summer, so they've got miles and miles on them. 
Get them from Birkenstock for $117.95 (available in women's 4/4.5–12/12.5 standard and wide).

Promising review: ""I bought this to use on a cruise. I had such an easy time carrying my drinks around. So many people asked where I purchased it from."" —Jasmine
Get it from Amazon for $9.99 (available in multipacks). 
Promising reviews: ""I saw this on YouTube and immediately wanted to try it. I have curly hair, which I love, but sometimes I just want to put it in a ponytail and go on with my day. This is a time-saver for all those little hairs that tend to stick up or refuse to stay in place. I’m not a fan of hairspray, and this even smells nice. I believe it’s a light coconut smell. Overall, you are satisfied, and you don’t need to use it much. I took it with me on vacation, and it saved me time in the evening from having to deal with bad hair days."" —Blanca Perez
Get it from Amazon for $7.99 (also available in multipacks). 
Promising review: ""This is such a great romper — soft and light. Perfect for summer. I wear a white T-shirt or tank top with it to give a pop of color. It is open in the back, so I feel like you need something underneath. A long sports bra would work well, too."" —Holly Carrell Yeager
Get it from Amazon for $29.99 (available in women's sizes S–XL and in eight colors).
Promising review: ""Absolutely love these bands. Whether on a cruise ship or relaxing on a beach, they keep your towel in place regardless of the wind. I also like that they are lightweight and small, so easy to travel/fly with, and no worries about them breaking. I now make them a go-to gift idea for family and friends!"" —Always Needing Retail Therapy!
Get a four-pack from Amazon for $11.99+ (available in four colors).
Promising review: ""I was so super skeptical about this product. I am not a frequent user of this brand either. I read some good reviews, so I went ahead and bought it ahead of a family cruise. I am so glad I did. I burnt my own shoulders and forehead on day one. When I made it back to my room, I could feel the pain setting in. I immediately applied this. Within a few hours, I could feel relief. I did apply it several times over the course of my vacation. I would recommend this product to anyone, and I will keep it in stock. Better than aloe gel."" —Laura
Get it from Amazon for $9.99.
Promising review: ""We LOVE this thing. We vacationed in Egypt for scuba diving in June. After the diving part, we toured many places in Cairo and the surrounding areas, mostly on foot. Yes, it was freaking HOT. Being used to a humid climate, the well-intentioned 'yeah, but it's a DRY heat' didn't lessen the discomfort we felt. This was a lifesaver. It will always be in my travel pack, and I can use it for gardening and any other activity outside during the summer. I highly recommend!"" —Native Texan

A lot of stock photos are notorious for their ridiculousness, and sometimes, it really does feel like they’re made this way on purpose.
The fun goes even higher when these pictures try and fail to depict something you’re closely familiar with. For example, some professionals online shared some absurd stock photos that just couldn’t get their jobs more wrong, and it’s absolutely hilarious. Scroll down to check them out!

Regardless of these pictures’ reputation, many companies still use stock photos for their websites and advertisements. Curious about why that is the case, why it isn’t good for business, and what the best alternatives are, we did some research and came across an article by Business.com that told us everything we needed to know.
To begin with, the article first explained that stock photographs are created by third-party professional photographers and sold online for use by other companies. Most of them cost no more than a dollar a piece and only grant permission to use.

If a person or a company wants something that’s not featured anywhere else online, they can also buy high-quality images with exclusive rights to them. However, with this option, the price goes up significantly, and a license for a single picture might rise to thousands of dollars. 
Since the first method saves time and money, it may appear to be a good option. But if we look at the research and the numbers, it shows that the truth is that companies’ visuals have a much more significant impact in this digital age than one might think.

The main problems with stock images start with being overused, inauthentic, and out of touch. As mentioned before, they cost little and are easy to get, which is why you can find the same pictures featured in many different places online. 
In addition to that, these images are rarely made for a specific purpose, focusing more on having just enough to connect to the basic idea, which makes them generic and makes you seem disconnected from your clients and your own business for using them.

   Anonyvet    Report  
Another thing is that while more and more diverse and inclusive stock photos are making their way online, this wasn’t always the case. In the not-so-distant past, most of these images were primarily focused on white people, making it challenging to find the right fit if a company tried to show its diversity and inclusion or simply be proud of its roots.
Lastly, it’s no stretch to say that these pictures are often cliched. They might be intended to be relatable and make you imagine yourself in the situations they depict, but more often than not, due to their lack of uniqueness, they only inspire mockery and laughter.

   carrie_m    Report  
But you don’t have to pay thousands of dollars to have a few good images on your website and ads, because the article suggests better ways to get them. For example, you can hire a professional photographer or a talented graphic designer to make something that captures the essence of your company and the idea you want to pass on and creates something unique that no one else has.
       
   Vlad_Stroescu    Report

You could even encourage your customers to take and submit pictures of your business and use what they send in. This will not only reduce the money you spend but will also provide you with photos that will probably be a lot more authentic and relatable than anything made professionally. 
But if none of that seems like the right choice, there is nothing wrong with using quality stock pictures. It just requires a little extra effort to find the good ones that are not being used by anyone else. Who knows, you might just hit the jackpot.
       
   Zogabogga    Report  
       
   RobKendt    Report  
Ultimately, there are a lot of factors that can impact a company’s decision regarding what kind of pictures to use for their representation. Even some of the ridiculous stock photos can be the right choice in some situations.
However, the most important part is to calculate the importance of this decision and act accordingly. After all, you don’t want to use images depicting your profession so absurdly that they make fun of them online.

With reference to the Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs), consider the following statements:
1. FPIs must register with SEBI through authorised Designated Depository Participants.
2. There is no platform which provides data on FPI investments.
3. An FPI can hold up to 30 per cent of the paid-up equity capital of a listed Indian company.
How many of the statements given above are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None
Explanation
— The Rupee continued its fall, breaching the 90-mark against the US dollar for the first time, weighed down by persistent equity selling by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs), uncertainty around the India-US trade deal and higher importer demand for the American currency.
— Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) in India are governed under a framework developed by the government in collaboration with regulatory authorities such as the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
— SEBI is the major regulator of FPIs, overseeing their registration, operational rules, and market compliance.
— FPIs must register with SEBI through an authorised Designated Depository Participant (DDP), such as the National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL). Hence, statement 1 is correct.
— An FPI may own up to 10% of the paid-up equity capital of a listed Indian firm. Hence, statement 3 is not correct.
— The Open Government Data (OGD) Platform India makes available public information about FDI, FPI and market developments in India. Hence, statement 2 is not correct.
Therefore, option (a) is the correct answer.

With reference to the current account deficits (CAD), consider the following statements:
1. The CAD always enhances the productive capacity and thus overall GDP growth.
2. A current account deficit happens when a country’s imports exceed its exports in terms of goods and services.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2
Explanation
— The country’s current account deficit moderated to $12.3 billion, or 1.3 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in July-September 2025 from $20.8 billion, or 2.2 per cent of GDP, in the year-ago period, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data showed.
— In the April-June 2025 period, the current account balance recorded a deficit of $2.4 billion, or 0.2 per cent of GDP. The current account deficit is the difference between exports and imports of goods and services. It is a key indicator of the country’s external sector.
— A current account deficit happens when a country’s imports exceed its exports in terms of goods and services. This deficit reflects a nation’s foreign transactions and can influence economic stability. Hence, statement 2 is correct.
— CAD can be beneficial only if imports are productive (capital goods, tech, machinery). But, it can also arise due to high consumption imports, oil price spikes, weak exports, etc. Hence, statement 1 is not correct.
Therefore, option (b) is the correct answer.

The term ‘bull run’ with reference to the stock market refers to:
(a) a prolonged rise in stock prices driven by strong investor confidence
(b) a sudden collapse in stock prices due to panic selling
(c) a period of extremely low trading activity in the market
(d) a temporary suspension of trading due to excessive volatility
Explanation
— Market participants have been in a cheery mood thanks to the stock market trading near record high levels over the past few days. However, the bull run has been dominated by banking, financial services, and a few other big-name stocks. This has skewed the overall picture of the benchmark Nifty 50 and Sensex indices.
— Many big private sector bank stocks are considered heavyweights, or among the most influential, in the indices. This means that if these stocks outperform significantly, it can paint a rosy overall picture even if other sectors underperform.
— The term ‘bull run’ refers to a prolonged rise in stock prices driven by strong investor confidence. In the financial markets, such as stocks, when prices have generally been increasing or are expected to increase, a bull market exists. Bull markets commonly refer to the stock market but can be applied to anything that is traded, such as bonds, real estate, currencies, and commodities.
Therefore, option (a) is the correct answer.

With reference to the Advanced Traffic Management System (ATMS), consider the following statements:
1. It has provisions for various electronic enforcement devices which help in speedy identification of incidents.
2. Presently, the ATMS is not installed on any of the highways or expressways in India.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2
Explanation
— The Ministry of Road Transport & Highways is expecting to introduce Advanced Traffic Management System (ATMS) across all the National Highways (NHs) in the country. Presently, the ATMS is installed in high traffic density National Highways and National Expressways such as Delhi-Meerut Expressway, Trans-Haryana, Eastern Peripheral Expressway etc. Hence, statement 2 is not correct.
— The Advanced Traffic Management System has provisions for various electronic enforcement devices which help in speedy identification of incidents on the highway stretches and effectively monitor the highways, thereby improving the response time of the on-site assistance. Hence, statement 1 is correct.
— The Government seeks to roll out Advanced Traffic Management System, based on an array of tower- and gantry mounted incident-detecting and speed-monitoring cameras with central monitoring locations, across all National Highways of 4-lane configuration and above.
— The Union Minister also stated that the government is also initiating barrier-less tolling based on Multi-Lane Free Flow (MLFF) Electronic Toll Collection system utilizing integrated technologies, notably Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) with AI analytics, combined with the existing RFID-based Electronic Toll Collection (FASTag).
Therefore, option (a) is the correct answer.
With reference to Nuclear Energy in India, consider the following statements:
1. India currently has more than 20 operational nuclear reactors.
2. Small Modulator Reactors technologies are aimed at supplying clean electricity to remote regions with limited grid infrastructure.
3. The Kudankulam nuclear power project (KKNPP) in Tamil Nadu is the largest nuclear power station in India.
How many of the statements given above are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None
Explanation
— Russian nuclear company Rosatom State Corporation is likely to make a strong pitch for deploying its small modular reactors (SMR) for targeted applications in India, alongside efforts to position its large new-generation atomic power reactor-based projects as the cornerstone of the bilateral cooperation between the two countries in the field of nuclear energy.
— Russia has a lead in the nascent field of SMRs, which are advanced nuclear reactors that have about a third of the generating capacity of most traditional nuclear power reactors but can produce a large amount of low-carbon electricity.
— Currently, two SMR projects have reached the operational stage globally, with an SMR named the ‘Akademik Lomonosov floating power unit’ that has two-modules of 35 MWe (megawatt electric) and started commercial operation in May 2020. The Lomonosov is a non-self-propelled power barge that doubles up as a floating nuclear power station and is docked in the Pevek harbour, providing heating for the Arctic port town of Pevek and supplying electricity to the regional Chaun-Bilibino power system. It is designated as the world’s northernmost nuclear power plant.
— During the November meeting, the two sides reviewed the progress of the Kudankulam nuclear power project (KKNPP) in Tamil Nadu — the largest nuclear power station in India and the flagship project of the Russian–Indian energy cooperation. Hence, statement 3 is correct.
— SMR technologies are aimed at supplying clean electricity to remote regions with limited grid infrastructure, as well as to individual industrial enterprises. India is looking at SMRs as a solution for localised applications, such as energy-hungry data centres, and quick scaling up of base load capacity. Hence, statement 2 is correct.
— India currently has 24 operational nuclear reactors totalling 7,943 MWe of capacity, with six reactors – 4,768 MWe – under construction. Another 10 units – some 7 GWe of capacity – are in pre-project stages. The Centre has a target to expand its nuclear energy capacity to 100 GWe by 2047, for which it plans to pursue a two-pronged approach: the deployment of large-capacity reactors as well as the use of SMRs to ensure faster deployment of units. Hence, statement 1 is correct.
Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer.

79,2025-12-04,"Even the most seasoned home cooks can admit that steak somehow always tastes better at a restaurant. That, of course, begs the question: Where will you get dinner? You might be surprised to learn that many of the more expensive chophouse chains out there aren't quite worth the money, while a number of other steak restaurants seem to be struggling back from the brink. Somewhere right in the middle, though, is a mid-priced dining destination that's hailed for its value and quality — so it's no wonder that it's currently dominating the steakhouse market in the United States.
If your guess was Texas Roadhouse, you'd be correct. In 2024, the chain raked in approximately $5.49 billion in sales, a nearly 15% increase from the year before (via Restaurant Business Online). Not only do those numbers place Texas Roadhouse firmly ahead of its steakhouse competitors, including LongHorn Steakhouse (which made $3.01 billion in sales last year) and Outback (which took in just $2.72 billion), but they've also secured its spot as the top-selling casual dining chain across all categories, from burger joints to seafood spots.
Per the 2024 report from Technomic, Texas Roadhouse's big boom in sales resulted in it officially dethroning Olive Garden as the most lucrative casual restaurant chain in America, a title the Italian concept had held since 2018. We guess those fresh-baked rolls with cinnamon butter finally caught up to Olive Garden's unlimited breadsticks. But even when compared to similar steakhouse chains, it's clear why Texas Roadhouse stands apart.
Despite its name, Texas Roadhouse was actually founded in Clarksville, Indiana back in 1993 — and is today headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky. But, of course, with more than 730 locations currently dotted across the globe, there are plenty of outposts to be found in Texas (including the company's largest), as well as every other state except Hawaii. The chain has been gaining ground in the casual dining landscape for years now. Back in 2023, Texas Roadhouse was singled out in a report by Brand Finance as the fastest growing chain restaurant not just in America, but the entire world, having experienced a 56% jump in brand valuation year over year. As the company continues to expand to new markets and open up new locations, it's showing no signs of slowing down its momentum.
Die-hard Texas Roadhouse diners clearly appreciate the quality of food they're getting at such reasonable price points. Indeed, all of the chain's beef is USDA Choice grade. That's a mere one tier below Prime, the highest grade a cut can get. That just means the meat has less marbling than the best of the best. Considering the fact that you can get a hefty porterhouse T-bone for about $35, the lack of Prime cuts probably isn't a problem. The restaurants also employ people to hand-cut every slab and use aging and seasoning processes to bring out the beef's best flavors — just some of the reasons Texas Roadhouse's steaks are so good."

85,2025-12-04,"Abu Dhabi-focused Solana infrastructure firm Solmate (SLMT) has signed a non-binding term sheet to acquire digital asset firm RockawayX in an all-stock deal that would create an institutional crypto group with more than $2 billion in assets and third-party stake.
The combined company would fold RockawayX’s infrastructure, liquidity and asset management units into Solmate, which is shifting from a passive digital asset treasury to an operating crypto business, and keep on trading under the SLMT ticker.
The deal, expected to close in the first half of 2026, still requires definitive agreements, regulatory clearance and shareholder approval.
Solmate CEO Marco Santori would lead the group, while RockawayX chief Viktor Fischer would run the RockawayX subsidiary and serve as Solmate’s executive chairman according to a press release shared with CoinDesk.
RockawayX, the blockchain arm of venture capital firm Rockaway Capital, brings onchain market making, lending and ""solver"" services used by major cross-chain bridges like Wormhole and Debridge, plus venture and credit funds that together oversee about $1.04 billion, along with around $1.1 billion staked to its validators.
Solmate, which rebranded from Brera Holdings earlier this year, plans to use that stack to earn yield on its treasury and to back Solana-based markets that handle tokenized stocks, treasuries and futures.
The two firms unveiled Solana infrastructure in the U.A.E. in November allowing local investors can stake assets inside the region.
""As the combined entity’s staked treasury grows, so would its ability to land transactions for high-frequency traders - all in addition to generating staking yield,"" the release said. ""Solmate's and RockawayX’s infrastructure would provide these same services, not only for trading, but for everyday onchain transactions like consumer payments as well.""
SLMT shares traded almost 6% higher at $2.51 in pre-market trading on Thursday.

From Cotality (formerly CoreLogic): US home price insights — December 2025 • Year-over-year price growth continues its downward trend, only rising 1.1% in October 2025. 

• Price declines expanded from six of the 100 largest metros in January to 32 by October, marking the broadest softening of prices since the early 2010s.
...
This year began with a stable growth trajectory, with national price growth posting an annual increase of 3.4% in January. However, that momentum slowed steadily as the year progressed. By October, annual appreciation was a mere 1.1% annual increase—the lowest rate since early 2012.

""The housing market in 2025 demonstrated remarkable resilience despite significant headwinds. Slowing price growth reflects a much-needed rebalancing after years of unsustainable gains. While some markets are experiencing declines, these adjustments will help restore affordability over time and make housing more accessible to a wider group of buyers,” said Cotality’s Chief Economist Dr. Selma Hepp. 

This deceleration highlights the impact of higher mortgage rates earlier in the year and persistent affordability challenges. Furthermore, price growth was dampened by a notable increase in inventory. Many markets saw a surge in both existing and newly built homes, slowing rates of in-migration and weakened demand.

The robust price increases of 2022 when top metros — primarily in Florida and the Southeast — saw gains exceeding 30% has now given way to declines. At the start of 2025, only six metros — primarily in Florida — posted year-over-year drops. By October, that number surged to 32, as pricing downturns extended into Texas, California, and various states throughout the Mountain West.
emphasis addedThis graph from Cotality shows the Top 10 coolest markets.The list is dominated by Florida and Texas. According to Cotality, the highest risk markets are all in Florida.House prices are under pressure with more inventory and sluggish sales.

                Reading time 14 minutes
      
My brother was visibly nervous at the thought of flying the buzzing, expensive, 360-degree drone hovering in front of himâespecially once I told him my drone kit sent to me for review cost $2,000. (There are cheaper bundles, but I’ll talk about pricing later.) His movements were slowed by winter cold as he took off his glove and gripped the Antigravity A1âs single-hand controller. I gave him a short rundown of how to fly, what buttons to hit, and slipped the A1âs bug-eyed headset over his eyes. I physically had to maneuver his fingers to the correct buttons. He couldnât see his own hands while his view was filled with a global, 360-degree image streaming from the drone.
Despite his initial fumbling, in mere minutes, he was flying at top speed, abandoning all pretenses and enjoying what is likely the most unique drone we’ve seen in years. âOh,â he sighed with his eyes still concealed behind the goggles and the exterior screen showing the Manhattan skyline in his field of view. âThis is way easier than I thought it would be.â
Antigravity A1
Designed by Insta360, the 360 camera drone is easy to fly even if you'll look goofy wearing the required headset. Professionals may get more or less use out of it depending on what they want.
Pros
Cons
What Iâm talking about is a drone thatâs odd in every possible way. The Antigravity A1âdesigned by a company spun out from 360-degree camera maker Insta360âcurrently allows only one control option, a flight stick crossed with the sawed-off grip of a pistol. You donât have to use any buttons to control the A1 (there are a few physical toggles for turning and elevation), but flying requires pointing in a direction, pulling the trigger, and letting the drone follow your lead. You donât so much capture one image through the droneâs sensor but everything surrounding the cameras thanks to its 360 lenses. And you donât so much see what the drone sees as much as you inhabit it through the gogglesâlike you’re standing in the middle of a transparent globe hovering several hundred meters above the ground.
Drones never stopped being interesting. Recent examples like the DJI Neo 2 and Mini 5 Pro are smaller and more capable than previous versions. Despite that, 2025 is an awkward time for stateside drone operators, as the most popular drone maker, DJI, is on the edge of being yanked out of the U.S. market entirely come Dec. 23. If youâve never taken to the air with a zippy, unmanned aircraft system, the skies are still a wonder to navigate. Not only is the A1 an incredibly accessible flyer that will inevitably upset traditional drone pilots, but it’s also a whole new category for drones with its 360-degree cameras.
See Antigravity A1 at Best Buy
The A1 is not a cheap drone. It starts at $1,600 for the standard bundle, which includes the drone, headset, controller, and a single battery for flying. Opting for the $1,900 Explorer bundle will get you a case to hold all your various drone parts plus an extra three batteries and a charging hub. If you spend $2,000, you get access to the longer-lasting High Capacity Flight Battery. Antigravity also has a set of propeller guards and replacement drone lenses for sale. Either way, the A1 will demand an investment in time, money, and all your wayward charging cables.
Judging by the number of pieces that make the A1 drone work, it feels like the engineers were trying to fill out a consumer tech bingo card. I first got hands-on time with an early version of the drone back in August, and yet the company has made huge strides in controls, menus, and usability in the short time since then. Still, to use the A1 requires three peripherals: the Vision Goggles, the Grip Motion Controller, and the A1 itself.
To call this a first-gen product would be ignoring just how much batshit engineering has gone into this amalgamation of AR (augmented reality) headset and drone. The Vision Goggles is relatively light, but it comes with a snug fit. It has two knobs at the bottom to set the PPD, or pixels per degree, which each user will need to twist to fine-tune how clear the screen UI will appear. Inside, it uses two pancake lenses with 1-inch micro OLED displays, each at a 2,560 x 2,560 resolution. Itâs a combination of Meta Quest 3-like optics with updated visuals pushing it closer to an Apple Vision Pro or Samsung Galaxy XR.
Once inside the headset, when you move your head, youâll be able to look freely up, down, left, right, frontways, slantways, however you want. The drone stitches the images from the two lenses, and you won’t ever see any drone parts in your view, save for rare scenes when taking off or touching down. Like the Apple Vision Pro, the A1’s goggles use a separate battery that gets plugged into a port at the bottom. Instead of leaving a long leash in your pocket, the battery is meant to dangle like a necklace. Thereâs no on or off button on the headset, either. You turn the Vision Goggles on and off again with the battery itself. If you lose the battery, youâve lost access to the headset.
The visuals from inside the Vision Goggles are already of good quality, though the fact the drone is streaming video to the headset means youâll inevitably lose detail. We flew the drone well over 500 yards away on a clear day in Calvert Vaux Park in lower Brooklyn, and we didnât experience any lag or streaming disruptions. Antigravity says its low-latency OmniLink 360 transmission system is the secret to clear video, and in my own tests that proved mostly true. The live view is only ever viewed at a max of 2K resolution and 30 fps inside the headset. However, that doesnât mean youâll always have such clear visuals in areas with more interference. The A1 routinely warned there was some kind of magnetic disruption in the area, even though we stood in an empty field for more than two hours. It gave me the same warning at home and in Gizmodo’s office, so Iâm not quite sure what it was detecting.
If thereâs any one element that captures the ludicrous nature of the A1 experience, itâs that the Vision Goggles have a special defogging function you can access from the main menu. This kicks in the internal fan system in case your eyes are getting extra sweaty in between the face cushion and surprisingly solid light seal. That round exterior screen will show any users looking at your face what youâre currently seeing. Plus, when you flip up both the antennas, youâll look like the classic Japanese bug-faced superhero Kamen Rider. There are so many excessive things about this headset that donât actually need to be there. Still, if you were looking for a fun device, there are few things more entertaining than an evil eye that shows onlookers what your drone is currently spying on.
The entire concept behind a 360-degree camera is that users donât need to do anything but hit the record button for the sake of capturing all angles of your antics. The one complication is that users then need to manually pick out their best shots in the edit room. When you stick the same technology on a drone, it takes on a whole new life with its own share of considerations.
The A1 drone itself isn’t that big or heavy. It weighs in at about 249 grams, or about 0.54 pounds with the regular battery, though it’s closer to 291 grams, or 0.64 pounds, with the high-capacity battery. That’s the scale of most drones and it’s light enough you don’t need to register it with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Its size reminds me first of the DJI Air 3S, which I spent some time with close to a year ago. The A1’s four propeller arms fold up into a neat bundle that fits snugly into an included hardshell case. Sure, that may not sound that big, but consider you also need to have the controller and goggles with you to fly the A1, and you’ll be weighed down a little more on any adventures.
Before you fly, you have to remember what your controller looks like. Once you have your headset on, youâll have nothing but memory to hit any of the necessary controls. The headset takes you through a set of hands-on tutorials for all the various button layouts, but even then I was often stuck taking off it off to see what I was doing. To reset and recenter the screen, you need to find the large scroll wheelâwhich also manipulates the horizontal orientationâand click it in. The controller’s menu button is a tiny key on the controller’s right side that’s impossible to find inside the headset. Even if the controller had a better layout, it would still be constrained by the inherent drawback of this droneâs design when there are no other control options, either with your phone or a traditional dual-stick controller.
You’ll also need to register the A1 drone with Antigravityâs services to get access to all of its flight features. Without registering, youâll be limited to flying 50 yards in the air and 30 yards away. However, after I installed everything, pushed through several firmware updates (which became a pain of desperately connecting and reconnecting the drone), registered my drone, and thumbed through all the lengthy tutorials, taking to the skies was a far easier exercise. The headset will show a crosshair of the direction where your controller is pointing. Holding down the trigger puts the drone into gear, and steering it merely requires pointing in a new direction.
See Antigravity A1 at Best Buy
This means you can be looking anywhere in the droneâs field of view but be flying in a completely different direction. The headsetâs view will show with a picture-in-picture at the top of the screen showing a view of whatâs in front of the droneâs sensors. This is why my brother took very little time to understand the drones controls. In the air, the only thing the pilot has to mind is the trigger. If you let off the gas, the A1 will simply hover in the air, spinning based on the direction of the controller. Flying it is a joy as well, which is only enhanced with its simplicity.
In addition to regular flying, there are preset flying patterns if you want to do a orbit shot or even set a predrawn flight path. While these features are more important on non-360 camera drones, the fact you have to use the headset and controller to select these options anyway makes them less useful than if there were other control options. However, the features do make it easier for non-flyers to experience the sights without having to figure out the A1’s controls.
Like your typical DJI drone, you can set the A1 to Normal, Cinematic, and Sports flying. With the toggle in âSâ mode, the drone can reach a top speed of 35.8 mph, or 16 m/s, though it slows to a crawl of 6.7 mph, or 3 m/s, in âCâ mode. In my tests of the pre-production drone back in August, the A1 would slow down every time I attempted a sharp turn. In this new version, I didnât experience any of those same issues. Taking it through a small obstacle course made up of jersey barriers and threading the drone through a small copse of trees didnât require any fine manipulation. I pointed, and the drone did the rest.
At least the A1’s object avoidance sensors did a good job at keeping me out of range of trees. The drone uses a binocular vision system supplemented with infrared sensors to avoid smacking into the ground. It will still struggle to detect thin branches, which may prove a hazard if you plan to shoot in the woods.
In the droneâs menus, you can also enable an first-person view, or âFPVâ mode, that is supposed to offer a more familiar experience to people who have flown other first-person drones. In this mode, you can also enable a âVirtual Cockpitâ that will create a badly rendered 3D dragon underneath you. Itâs cute, but entirely unnecessary. The FPV mode is already more difficult to maneuver than the default setting.
Thereâs really no comparison. The A1 isnât made to complete any fancy tricks like a barrel roll or somersault. Other FPV drones like the DJI Avata 2 rely on their gimbal-mounted sensor and zippy flying capabilities to help pilots line up the right shot, but the idea behind the 360-degree camera mounted on the A1 means it doesnât need any fancy flying to capture what it needs to.
The A1 tries to split the difference between a consumer-level âjust for funâ drone and a more professional-minded quadcopter built for people who plan to do some proper filmmaking. Itâs easily one of the most fun drones you can buy today, one that you can effortlessly share with friends. For professionals, the choice gets more muddled.
Insta360âs class-leading X5 360-degree camera is still one of the best around despite GoPro and DJI trying to knock it off its throne. If you thought that the Antigravity A1 would simply be an X5 strapped to a drone, it was never going to be that simple.
The A1 can shoot video at a maximum 8K resolution and 30 fps, with options down to 24 fps. While the number of people who use an 8K TV is infinitesimally small, you actually want to capture 360 footage at such a high resolution. The camera is essentially two sensors working in tandem, recording all the pixels in huge arc. Otherwise, youâll have options for capturing 5.2K footage at up to 60 fps. If you want to shoot at 100 fps or for any true slo-mo experience, you need to drop it down to 4K.
Both the headset and drone each have a slot for a microSD card, though the drone itself does have an extra 20GB of internal storage just in case. The A1 can accept cards as large as 1TB, which should be enough for all casual and most professional drone flyers.
The actual sensor on the drone is 1/1.28-inch in size with an f/2.2 aperture. Thatâs a larger aperture than the f/2.0 on the X5, though it wonât make too big a difference in terms of depth of field. The A1 has a slightly smaller max video bitrate (170Mbps versus 180) but the same ISO range. So it should be just as capable as the X5 360-degree camera, right? Well, in my testing, the one issue I came across was the video stitching. On a regular 360-degree camera, it has to close the gap between the two sensors to make the spherical video look seamless. The gulf between the two sensors on the A1 is much wider than on a stick camera. In my footage, I would see some strange artifacts and occasionally notice close-up objects distort when I finally had the chance to take a gander at the final footage.
The drones also include a small menu option to enable a feature for enhanced AI stitching, though that doesnât impact the final footage. You wonât know if youâve produced any visual artifacts until you watch the footage yourself, which thankfully can be done inside the Vision Goggles. That could still pose a problem for any amateur cinematographer. The entire point of this drone is to get the shot without needing to be at the right place at the right time. Any visual distortion could lead to messy post-production cleanup work. For an example, watch the family that came to visit me during one of my flights. Their faces start to flicker and distort to an annoying degree.
And if you plan to shoot in low light, the A1 may not be the best one for it. Even when outside with the sunset on the horizon, the 8K footage started to look grainy. Indoors, low-light shooting looked far worse.
Antigravity also offered me a look at its new Antigravity Studio editing software built specifically for 360-degree footage. Itâs essentially the same software as Insta360 Studio, which is to say it’s simple enough to use even for a complete amateur. I edited several videos using simple keyframes to set the shots I wanted at the 9:16 aspect ratio. I also played around with some of the transitions, like one that creates a âtiny planetâ effect by zooming out through the fisheye lens. I didnât do any post-processing work to make each video look better, but with a mix of 8K and 5.2K footage, you can see the difference in base quality. Any 8K footage will inevitably look better on a 360-degree camera.
Antigravity Studio crashed several times as I attempted to export footage. It may be a result of beta software on Windows, so I canât get too riled up about it. The app is also available on Mac. However, it does point to a common problem among 360-degree cameras. If you simply want to upload your cool drone shots to TikTok or Instagram, it will inevitably take more effort than a more traditional camera or drone. The Antigravity app supposedly allows users to share their footage right from the drone and complete some easy highlight reels akin to what you can do in the GoPro Quik app. However, I couldnât connect the A1 drone to my phone after many, many attempts.
The Antigravity A1 comes with a single battery in the basic bundle, though for review the company sent me the Infinity Bundle, which comes with three âhigh-capacityâ flight batteries. The less expensive standard bundle only comes with three regular flight batteries. The regular battery clocks in at 2,360mAh, while the high-capacity version is almost double that at 4,345mAh. How much you spend on the drone will dictate how much flight time you get.
The regular batteries are rated for approximately 24 minutes of flight time, while the high-capacity versions will let you go for closer to 40 minutes. In reality, youâll get less flight time when you start recording, especially at 8K. I went out into my tests with four high-capacity batteries. Running the drone near-continuously and shooting at 5.2K, I blew through three whole batteries in a little less than two hours. When each battery reaches around 15%, the drone will initiate an automatic return-to-home landing.
Still, it was enough for a fun outing with friends, even if it required close to 30 minutes of charging with the included Charging Hub. The hub can charge three batteries at once, although strangely enough the middle battery requires exposing the charging pins on the rear side and cradling it in an exposed bracket. DJIâs charging hub has three separate pockets for all three batteries at once. Antigravity likely wanted to make the hub fit inside the carrying case, which Iâll add is a very handy inclusion since youâll need to carry the headset, controller, and drone with you everywhere.
I didnât have the opportunity to test the less-capable battery. Whether the promised 24 minutes of battery life (likely less when recording at 8K) is good enough for you depends on how you plan to use it. Hopefully, youâll get the necessary shots you want without having to do many reshoots. With the stitching problem, you may need to carry some extra batteries with you just in case.
The Antigravity A1 is desperate to split the difference between whatâs merely a fun drone and something any regular flyer will want to have on hand. For its $1,600 starting price, you get everything you need to fly the drone, though youâll end up spending more for extra batteries. I have a hard time recommending the standard bundle considering the lack of a carrying case and batteries, so most people who buy the A1 drone will end up spending more than the base price. Compare that to other FPV drones, and you have to justify the 360-degree camera for the extra cost. A DJI Avata 2 Fly More Combo that includes three batteries, a case, controller, and headset, retails anywhere between $1,500 to $1,800 on Amazon depending on how many accessories you want. (Of course, thatâs before all DJI drones are effectively banned in the U.S.)
This drone is not a simple commitment, despite how easy it is to use after you get used to its odd controls. Sure, it could be a toy you take out to impress your friends or family, but the A1 is better as a device you use to explore your environment. You can truly get a sense for the scale of a place through the ability to look everywhere around you. You can take that same footage home and spy on things you may have missed when you were staring off at the distant horizon.
And thereâs truly nothing else like it that Iâve personally experienced. Novelty may be enough for some, but othersâincluding myselfâare just looking for a usable drone. Even as a first attempt, the A1 manages to clear that bar, despite some occasional issues with the end footage. So if youâre looking for the most unique drone you can get in the U.S. (especially considering DJI has effectively stopped launching drones stateside thanks to Uncle Samâs protectionist policies), you donât have to look further than this one.

90,2025-12-04,"It feels like we've been waiting for an eternity. While users around the world have been playing around with their new OnePlus flagship for nearly a month at this time, US users are just about to start having their patience be rewarded.
For those unaware, the recent US government shutdown caused the FCC to suspend most of its functions, including the certification of new devices. This was the main reason for the delay in the OnePlus 15's availability stateside. 
US pre-orders start December 4
Regulatory hurdles cleared last week, and with the device finally out of certification limbo, the OnePlus 15, as of today, December 4, is finally available for pre-order in the US. 
And well, to make up for the delay, the OnePlus 15 comes with one of the best pre-order campaigns we've ever seen.
OnePlus isn't just throwing in a free case or protective film with the new phone, it's bundling full accessories in. As indicated by the tech giant in its original pre-order intimation, freebies are first-come, first-served. Since pre-orders went live earlier today, the OnePlus Watch 3 freebie is already out of stock, but the others are still up for grabs!
With the purchase of either the 256GB or 512GB variant, you can claim one of the following gifts:
It's worth noting that the pre-order window is brief. It starts today and closes on Thursday, December 11th. After the 11th, the OnePlus 15 will go in 'Open Sale' status, with OnePlus suggesting that more deals are on the way. We doubt that any of those deals will be as big as a free $300 watch being bundled-in for free, though we'll be keeping our eyes open. 
Are you planning to pre-order the OnePlus 15? Or are you waiting for discounts on a different phone? Let us know in the comments below!

91,2025-12-04,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) took the world by storm when OpenAI released its chatbot, dubbed ChatGPT, for public use back in November 2022. Since then, multiple companies have launched their own chatbots to try to claim a piece of the growing market. Even with multiple players in the market, ChatGPT receives over 2.5 billion requests per day, which should give you an idea of just how much people use AI these days.
According to OpenAI, ChatGPT users mainly use the chatbot for assistance in everyday tasks and ""three-quarters of conversations focus on practical guidance, seeking information, and writing."" Despite the meteoric rise of AI use within both personal and professional settings, many people building these systems don't trust them.
A debate over AI usage is happening as the rest of us are increasingly becoming reliant on AI chatbots and trust them with some critical tasks, such as writing police reports. It may come as a surprise, then, that many AI experts are skeptical about the technology and, according to a recent article by The Guardian, some are even advising their friends and family to avoid it altogether, for various reasons.
If there's a group of people who understand AI chatbots better than most, it's the experts building the systems. These are the people responsible for pushing the boundaries with every new model that is released to market, and those who help assess the quality of output for better results. The Guardian spoke to various experts in the AI field who expressed their skepticism about the technology. One of the recurrent themes: how companies prioritize rapid turnaround for AI raters, and how they don't offer these workers enough training and resources to produce their best deliverables.
""We're expected to help make the model better, yet we're often given vague or incomplete instructions, minimal training and unrealistic time limits to complete tasks,"" Brook Hansen told The Guardian. One worker also revealed how some colleagues tasked with rating sensitive medical content were in possession of only basic knowledge about the topic. Criticism is not limited to the rating side. One Google AI rater revealed to The Guardian how he became skeptical of the broader technology, and even advises friends and family to avoid chatbots after seeing just how bad the data used to train models really is.
Another reason why some AI experts don't trust chatbots is the propensity for hallucination, or completely off-base or erroneous reasoning coming from the models. In a YouTube video by OpenAI, CEO Sam Altman says it's ""interesting"" that people have a high degree of trust in ChatGPT — perhaps misplaced, in his view, as AI hallucinates and shouldn't be trusted that much. Andrej Karpathy (former research scientist and founding member at OpenAI, and former director of Tesla's AI division) also discussed some of the limitations of AI in an article published on X, cautioning against using AI in production without human oversight.
The short answer is no. If experts who work in the field are skeptical about trusting AI, you should approach AI chatbot outputs with a pinch of salt. Earlier this year, we saw multiple cases of Google AI overviews making blatant mistakes – one clear sign that you shouldn't take AI outputs at face value. Because of such mistakes, there are things you should never ask ChatGPT or any other AI chatbot, as you're more likely to get misleading information.
For example, in an interview with MIT Technology Review, Meredith Broussard, a data scientist and NYU professor, advised against AI use for questions surrounding social issues, as these questions are more nuanced by nature. Additionally, a recent study by NewsGuard, a media literacy non-profit organization, found that the rate at which AI chatbots from major companies are likely to repeat false information almost doubled from 18% in August 2024 to 35% in August 2025.
The report found ChatGPT was likely to spread false claims 40% of the time. Such statistics are why even Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai, cautions against blindly trusting AI chatbots. All information or dialogue derived from chatbots should be cross-checked manually for veracity."
92,2025-12-04,"RAMnarök continues as Micron shut down Crucial
The ongoing chaos in RAM production, with mass shortages jacking up street prices to are-you-joking levels, now has a major manufacturer casualty. Micron have announced the end of Crucial, their consumer brand for PC memory and SSDs – and likely a familiar name to gaming PC builders who’ve been hooking up their storage drives and slotting in their RAM sticks for decades.
""Micron has made the difficult decision to exit the Crucial consumer business in order to improve supply and support for our larger, strategic customers in faster-growing segments,"" wrote Micron’s Executive VP and Chief Business Officer Sumit Sadana.
In other words, there’s a whole bunch of AI data centres cropping up, and Crucial are rudely hogging memory hardware that could be put to more profitable use than merely supplying grassroots interests in computing and games. Important uses! Like generating a thumbnail image of Mr Beast pretending to swim away from a shark, or unilaterally rewriting article headlines in Google Discover so they’re full of incoherent lies. God, you PC people are so selfish.
Crucial RAM and SSD shipments will continue until 2026, though expect the former, especially, to remain at silly-high prices while that data centre demand keeps shortages short and costs in the clouds. Probably worse so than before, now that there’ll be one less company trying to keep stock flowing.
After February, they’re gone for good, which is a huge shame. Crucial had been making quality, relatively affordable components and storage right up until Micron’s act of filicide, with the likes of the T500 and X9 Pro currently holding pride of place in our best SSDs list. I’ve even had a few more recent models – the T710 NVMe drive and the external X10 – in my cupboard, waiting for me to find the time to test them. The PC I’m writing this on, and have played games for years with, has a Crucial P5 as its main SSD, and I somehow remember choosing a 2x4GB Crucial Ballistix RAM set for my first DIY build after reading an agreeable review of it in PC Gamer’s then-tiny hardware section.
Even if you don’t have a pile of to-be-benchmarked components in your house, that’s a lot of hobbyist history to just... end. And for what?

Those of us who were using Twitter widely 15 years ago probably remember this. In 2011, a post suggesting that Detroit build a statue to RoboCop went viral, with the then-mayor of the city even chiming in. Peter Weller, the star of RoboCop, even released a video about it. Like many moments on the internet, though, for most of us, that was it. But in Detroit, the fight continued, and this week, after almost 15 years, the RoboCop statue is finally on display.
You can see the statue in all its glory below, courtesy of the Detroit Metro Times, which broke the story.
ð¥²
 â¬ original sound – Detroit Metro Times 
 
Clearly, this is awesome and something that is long overdue. Few cities are as synonymous with fictional heroes as Detroit is with RoboCop. Rocky Balboa has a statue in Philadelphia, of course. The Ghostbusters were New York guys. The Karate Kid is all about the San Fernando Valley. There are others too, but it’s not a long list.
It did, however, take a very long time for this to happen. The reasons for the delay are numerous, and again, the Detroit Metro Times has a fantastic piece about it from 2021. You should definitely head over there and read it, but basically it’s a whole other story of heroism, as artists and interested parties teamed up over the years to make it happen, battling cancer and red tape along the way. The statue was actually completed around that time, but it took four more years for it to find a permanent home. Which it finally has.
That permanent home is in the Eastern Market section of Detroit, Michigan, at 3434 Russell Street. I know if I ever find myself in Detroit, that’s going to be one of my first stops. What about you?
As for RoboCop, not only has he now been immortalized as a statue, but he may soon return to pop culture prominence. Amazon Studios has been working on bringing the character back as a TV show for a few years, and presumably, that’s still in the works.
Are there other fictional characters that are city-specific and deserve this kind of treatment? Let us know below.

96,2025-12-04,"Billionaire John Morgan sometimes wakes in a rush, grateful to find himself in his own bed instead of the place his mind occasionally drags him at night. In a recurring dream, he's stranded in an old car with almost no money, unsure how he'll make it.
Morgan, valued at $1.5 billion, grew up as the oldest of five in a family that was ""financially insecure,"" he told Business Insider's Kevin Reilly for the video series Authorized Account:
Despite coming from little, Morgan went on to found one of the nation's largest personal injury law firms, Morgan & Morgan, which has offices in all 50 US states. He also owns a collection of science attractions, malls, hotels, and billboard companies.
However, listen to Morgan for even just a few minutes, and it becomes clear he's not your stereotypical pompous billionaire. He admits to having imposter syndrome, dreams about losing everything, and attributes a lot of his success to sheer luck.
Here are five mindsets that shape how Morgan works, hires, and sees risk and opportunity in places others might overlook.
Morgan's first job out of law school didn't pay much. ""My first job doing personal injury, I had a $10,000 base and 10% of whatever I would close. And I think my first year I made like $15,000.""
After a few years, he started his own law firm. However, despite its tremendous success over the last 37 years, he's never managed to shake the feeling of imposter syndrome.
""I don't know how this happened,"" he says of his wealth and success, ""and I'm going to be found out one day."" He doesn't see this mindset as a weakness, though.
In the philosophy of late businessman Andy Grove, which Morgan emulates: Only the paranoid survive. It's that paranoia fueled by his imposter syndrome that feeds Morgan's undying drive. ""It keeps you hungry,"" he says.
That's why he starts every morning by checking numbers. ""I get numbers from my attendance and my attractions. I get numbers from new cases signed up the day before. I get all sorts of leaderboard reports,"" he says.
Morgan talks about luck the way some people talk about weather — unpredictable, constant, and impossible to ignore. ""Life is a thousand left turns, a thousand right turns, a thousand U-turns,"" he says. One different turn, he adds, could have changed everything.
He traces that belief to a feeling of humility. Success, he warns, convinces people they are far smarter than they truly are. And he believes the remedy is simple: look for opportunity everywhere because luck shows up only when you put yourself in its path, he says.
Chasing luck meant saying yes to everything — cold-calling lawyers for cases in his early law years, visiting union halls, or going to events other people dismissed as pointless. The more chances he took, the more ""lottery balls"" he had in play.
""When you're looking for opportunity,"" he says, ""the more lottery balls you have, the more chance you have to win the bingo game.""
That mindset guided him through the biggest pivot of his career. When lawyer advertising became legal in 1977, many attorneys refused to try it. Morgan borrowed $100,000 and went all in anyway, even though ""I was embarrassed about it,"" he says. The calls came almost immediately.
This line came from Morgan's father, whose continuous string of job losses didn't help the family's financial struggles when Morgan was a child.
""But the great gift that my dad gave us was every time he would get fired … he would say these words: 'Whatever you do, be a professional, nobody can fire you,'"" Morgan said. ""And it was seared in my mind that I was going to do something where nobody could fire me. I wasn't going to be in his position.""
His father's message shaped how he handles risk and made him determined to work for himself. This mindset formed the backbone of his career, from selling Yellow Pages ads for AT&T to help pay for law school and founding Morgan & Morgan in 1988 in his early 30s, far earlier than his friends had expected.
""They were all working for somebody,"" he said of his friends. ""I'd already watched my dad work for somebody. I'm like, that ain't happening.""
In the early days of his firm, Morgan says he was deeply involved in the day-to-day decisions, making cold calls to law firms, signing up cases, and driving his Nissan Maxima from one lawyer to another.
Decades later, he says, ""most importantly, the thing that I learned was to scale and delegate. And once you learn to scale and delegate, then you get what you can't buy, which is time.""
He spends part of that time picking what he calls ""send-delete people"" — employees who handle something the moment he sends it and never need follow-up. Once he sees that in someone, he delegates ""a little bit more and a little bit more.""
The result is freedom to focus his time and energy on strategy, expansion, and the next puzzle to solve.
While many financial experts say accruing good debt is key to building wealth, Morgan avoids debt as much as possible.
After starting several banks in the 1980s, he learned how compounding interest ""is like a tsunami"" and how fast debt can ""swallow you.""
That said, he did borrow $100,000 to invest in mass-market advertising in the early days of his firm. However, he says he resisted borrowing when starting many of his other business ventures, including interactive museums, hotels, and shopping centers. For example, when he bought a struggling mall in Myrtle Beach, he says he paid cash.
""I am scared to death of debt,"" he says. ""I have at this time zero debt, zero personal guarantees on anything.""

98,2025-12-04,"Samsung, as the first-mover in the foldable market, always held a strong position in the market, but it’s no secret that prior generations were putting the company on a path to second place. Following the launch of the Galaxy Z Fold 7, though, Samsung has reestablished its dominance over the foldable market according to the latest numbers.
Counterpoint Research reports that Samsung made up 64% of the global foldable market in Q3 2025, up from 56% the year prior. That’s a huge increase, with Samsung’s overall shipment volume increasing by 32% on the back of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7. 
OEM performance further underscored the outsized influence of the Samsung Galaxy Z cycle this quarter. In particular, the Z Fold7’s slimmer frame, lighter hardware, improved hinge durability and reduced crease visibility broadened its premium appeal and drove a stronger-than-expected uplift.
The increase is also despite nearly every other major player – Huawei, Motorola, and Vivo – seeing marked improvements to their shipment volume as well. Honor and Xiaomi, though, did see considerable drops in their shipment totals.
It just goes to show, yet again, that Samsung’s efforts to drastically improve the Galaxy Z Fold 7 paid off. In a prior comparison in Q2, ahead of the Fold 7’s launch, Samsung foldable shipments were behind both Huawei and Motorola.
There’s no mention of Google’s Pixel Fold series here, though that’s not exactly a surprise, as Pixel remains a niche player in this already-niche portion of the smartphone market.
The report goes on to point out that existing brands such as Samsung and Huawei are “demonstrating clear technology leadership and sharpening product differentiation strategies” ahead of Apple’s expected foldable iPhone launch next year, pointing to Samsung’s Galaxy Z TriFold as an example.
