Prediction Markets 
Kalshi’s CEO is bullish on the future of prediction market betting to solve disagreements for people, or at least make him very, very rich. What if every outcome in your life could be turned into a way to win or lose money?âImagine your very existence has been gamified into a gambling roguelike. “The long-term vision is to financialize everything and create a tradable asset out of any difference in opinion,” Tarek Mansour said at last month’s Citadel Securities conference.
What sounds like a loading screen from Cyberpunk 2077 was enough to make investors jump at the opportunity to turn angry Reddit threads into stock tickers you can gamble on. Kalshi recently raised $1 billion in its latest funding round this week, leading to an $11 billion valuation. What are investors so pumped about? Here’s the pitch Mansour gave in November on stage with co-founder Luana Lopes Lara:
[Prediction markets are] pretty much already close to a $100 billion a year asset class. It’s pretty easy to imagine it 10x from here. We haven’t even started. It’s been a year. I think a very large number of people care, much larger than traditional markets, and I think retail as a pie has just been growing in the U.S. and I think it’s going to keep growing–it’s growing in the stock market, it’s growing outside the stock market.
The long term vision is to financialize everything and create a tradable asset out of any difference of opinion. And I think if you do build a general purpose exchange that can resolve differences of opinions on anything the [total addressable market] is quite massive, quite a bit bigger than the current TAM of the stock market.
Putting aside the retail trading and the institutional trading product there’s sort of this separate product which is we are living in a world where we have an abundance of information but there’s a lot of noise and we don’t really understand what’s real from what’s not and prediction markets are an antidote to that, they do a very good job of surfacing information and distilling truth to people.
The co-founder of Kalshi says: ""âThe long-term vision is to financialize everything and create a tradable asset out of any difference in opinion.""

Mansour’s prediction market, i.e. opinion polls turned into casinos, was established back in 2018. Like rivals such as Polymarket, It’s pitched as a sophisticated tool for hedging risk. Picture some big world event like a war or an election. No one knows the outcome or what it might mean for their business so they trade bets to reduce the chance of losing a ton of money.
I’m not going to weigh in on whether that makes any sense because that’s not what Mansour is saying is going to make Kalshi go 10X. The real moonshot is being able to take the popularity of betting on stocks with apps like Robinhood or sports with Draft Kings, and apply it to the totality of life. Every outcome, not just one in the market or a football game, will be an opportunity for people to gamble, ahem, I mean hedge risk.
It all feels very Sam Bankman-Fried-coded. Remember that big FTX crypto debacle from the wunderkind that was also making grand pronouncements on stage at conferences just before it all went belly up? Headlines like this about Kalshi and Polymarket don’t drive confidence. Where’s the prediction market for betting against prediction markets?
If the post-covid era has taught us anything about the current state of the distraction economy, it’s that we love finding new ways to waste time and money on our phones. I don’t actually think most people want to treat break room debates or dinner table arguments like betting on horse racing. Maybe if it was more like Umamusume: Pretty Derby.
But I think Mansour does and the people prepared to give his company billions do and that’s all it takes for bad things to happen.

American Eagle's marketing campaigns are giving the company a meaningful boost.
The retailer has launched a number of campaigns this year that have been at the center of viral moments online.
It looks like they're paying off financially. Its stock has been up this year, and its total revenue was $1.4 billion for the third quarter that ended November 1, roughly 6% higher year-over-year.
American Eagle raised forward-looking guidance for the fourth quarter, and its stock rose at least 10% after hours on Tuesday.
The boost was driven by its intimates and loungewear brand, Aerie, which saw comparable sales rise by 11%. While other retailers are spending big on AI products for consumers, Aerie is making a promise not to use the technology.
Its pledge not to use AI in its ads, shared in an Instagram post, garnered tens of thousands of likes, making it the brand's most popular post in the past year as of October, Metricool, which tracks social media engagement, told Business Insider in October.
Its success is also due in part to the star power it tapped into with Sydney Sweeney and Travis Kelce being featured in campaigns that gained traction on social media.
Sweeney's ""Great Jeans"" partnership in July drew criticism online from some who said the campaign had a negative message that promoted ""regressive"" beauty standards. American Eagle tripled down on the campaign.
""Sydney Sweeney sells great jeans. She is a winner, and in just six weeks, the campaign has generated unprecedented new customer acquisition,"" chief marketing officer Craig Brommers said in September.
In August, American Eagle released a clothing line in collaboration with NFL star Travis Kelce and his Tru Kolors brand, one day after he announced his engagement to Taylor Swift.
The two campaigns combined made up 44 billion impressions, as it attracted more customers ""than ever before.""
""American Eagle launched its largest, most impactful advertising campaigns ever, which are delivering results by collaborating with high-profile partners who are defining culture,"" president and executive creative director Jen Foyle said on the Tuesday call.
The brand is not done forming an all-star cast of celerity partners. The most recent campaign is with Martha Stewart, and American Eagle is betting it'll be a hit with Gen Z customers.
""Martha Stewart resonates with Gen Z. That's a perfect example of what we're up to,"" Foyle said.

Making progress in any sport really comes down to knowing your numbers. If you want to improve, you need a solid idea of what youâre working toward and a convenient way to keep an eye on it. Whether youâre just getting into running and hitting your favorite trails, jumping in open water for triathlon training, or biking some hills, a reliable GPS watch can make all the difference. It helps you stay motivated, stay on track, and avoid losing steam. Conveniently, Samsungâs newly released 2025 version of its smartwatchâthe Galaxy Watch 8 Classicâis still on sale post Black Friday and Cyber Monday. This watch normally goes for $500, but right now you can grab it for 20% off, bringing it down to $400. You end up saving yourself a whole $100.
Now this is the Classic model of the Watch 8. What’s different about it? First up, it’s much bigger. The standard models come in either 40mm or 44mm. This watch face measures across at 46mm. But more noticeable that that, the watch has a metal casing. The new lug system allows for easy band detachment and replacement. So when you’re not working out, this watch maintains a professional work you could even pair nicely with a suit. Then when it’s time to hit the pavement in your running attire, swap out the band for a silicone one, easily.

The Galaxy Watch 8 runs on Samsungâs Galaxy AI platform, which helps it deliver smarter health and fitness tracking. Whenever you head out for a ride, run, hike, or any sort of outdoor workout, the watch can keep tabs on how youâre performing in real time and compare it to your past sessions. Throughout the day, it can nudge you with personalized wellness suggestions to help you steadily move toward your fitness and health goals. The improved heart-rate tracking is also a big upgrade. It filters out the noise from natural body motion, giving you a more accurate reading than previous Samsung watches.
Your sleep gets just as much attention. The Watch 8 tracks your patterns closely enough to flag possible signs of sleep apnea and gives you a much clearer look at how well youâre actually resting each night. When you wake up, you get a quick snapshot of your energy level and readiness for the day. It combines details like your sleep score, steps, heart-rate behavior, and more to give you a realistic picture of where your body stands.





Of course, itâs not just about fitness. The Galaxy Watch 8 works great as a full-blown smartwatch for everyday life. You can read and respond to messages straight from your wrist without fishing your phone out of your pocket. And if itâs paired with your phone, the watch becomes a remote camera controllerâperfect for group shots or selfies at a distance. You can change settings, hit the timer, and take the picture all from the watch.
The new Watch 8 can hit up to 3,000 nits, while the Watch 7 maxes out at 2,000 nits. That extra brightness makes a big difference when youâre checking stats under direct sunlight. Both models are still tough enough for all-weather training, whether youâre out in the cold, the rain, or the heat.
The Galaxy Watch 8 is also designed from the ground up to work with Gemini, the AI assistant built by Samsung and Google. You can use it to check your schedule, reply to texts, set reminders, and handle a bunch of everyday tasks with ease.

Black Friday came and went with some decent Apple deals on Amazon, but the retailer didn’t move all its inventory during the rush. That means the all-time low pricing on the MacBook Air M4 256GB, which launched in March 2025, is still available right now at $749 instead of the usual $999 tag. This matters because Apple rarely sees discounts this deep, especially on hardware that’s less than a year old.
See at Amazon
The Apple M4 processor makes things a lot faster and you’ll notice it right away when you switch between demanding apps. Video editing software that used to stutter now works perfectly with 4K video, and you can run multiple Chrome tabs and Photoshop at the same time without hearing a fan noise because there isn’t one. The chip architecture puts the CPU, GPU, and neural engine all on one piece of silicon which makes data move faster between parts and uses less power. This means that the battery can last up to 18 hours without dying when you’re doing real work instead of just browsing Safari.
This hardware can run Apple Intelligence on its own and it can do things like help you write, make images, and organize your files without sending your data to other servers. The privacy architecture does everything on the device, so your personal information never goes to the cloud for processing. This is very helpful when you want to summarize long email threads, make custom emojis based on descriptions, or have the system sort notifications by how important they really are.
The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display has a brightness of 500 nits and can show one billion colors: This means you can work outside without having to squint at a dim screen. The text is clear enough that you won’t strain your eyes when you write for a long time, and the colors in photos are accurate enough that designers and photographers can trust them. The bezels around the screen are thin enough to give you the most viewing area without making the whole thing too big to handle.
Two Thunderbolt 4 ports handle charging, data transfer at 40GbpsÂ and video output to external displays, so connectivity is complete. You can use two external monitors at the same time, which turns this light laptop into a real workstation when you’re at your desk. MagSafe charging is back and it has a magnetic connection that safely disconnects if someone trips over the cable. This keeps both your laptop and your sanity safe. If you have a router that works with Wi-Fi 6E, your wireless speeds will be faster. The four-speaker system with Spatial Audio makes the sound surprisingly immersive for a chassis this thin and the three-mic array also does a good job of isolating your voice during calls, even in noisy places.
This price of $749 is $250 less than what the hardware usually sells for which is a good deal because it usually holds its value all year. You’re getting a current-generation processor with twice the base RAM, which will keep the machine up to date for years to come with software updates and more demanding applications. This is the lowest price ever for anApple laptop that can handle both creative work and everyday tasks without any problems.

Uber announced on Wednesday that it is launching its Robotaxi service in Dallas as the company prepares to introduce its Waymo rival into other major cities next year. But it wonât be totally human-less yet.
The company said in its news release that vehicles, provided with partner Avride, will operate in a 9-square-mile area of Dallas starting in the Downtown area when a user requests an UberX, Comfort, or Comfort Electric through the app after users update their preferences to include robotaxi options. The service will be available at the same cost as a regular trip on one of those Uber levels. Plans are pending for an expansion to other Dallas-area neighborhoods.
However, Uber says it will use human supervision behind the wheel of the Avride vehicles before moving to fully driverless operation. It did not give a timetable for that change.
Uber is competing in an increasingly crowded “self-driving” market as Waymo rapidly expands its service to other cities and now airports, Teslaâs also-human-supervised Robotaxi seeks approval in new markets, and Amazonâs Zoox expands into San Francisco last month. The original ride-hailing company has spent this year backing its plans with targeted cities and new partners.Â 
The Lucid Gravity electric SUV will be the basis for a planned fleet of 20,000 Uber robotaxis over the next six years, following a July announcement. That release included news that Uber was also making an investment in Lucid as well as the robotics manufacturer Nuro. In October, Nvidia announced a deal with Uber to build 100,000 autonomous vehicles starting in 2027.
Uberâs deal with Nuro has already yielded closed-course testing in Las Vegas for vehicles ahead of a launch in âdozens of markets around the world,â according to the companyâs statement in July.

Planning to host a gathering this holiday season? You need a good speaker to add the vibes and to keep your guests entertained. Beats make some of the best-sounding options out there that pack bold audio, plus offer incredible battery to keep the party going all night.
If you missed grabbing a solution during Black Friday or Cyber Monday, all is not lost. We just spotted the Beats Pill Bluetooth speaker going for just $100 at Amazon right now, after a sweet $50 discount for Cyber Week. All color options are discounted, including black, red, and gold. Just note that itâs a leftover deal from the main event that expired at midnight. Lingering offers donât stay in stock for long, which means itâs technically your last chance to save this big on the speaker. There are no coupon codes to worry about, either, as the discount applies automatically at checkout. Even better, youâll be saving on the delivery fee, too, which adds even more value to the purchase.
See at Amazon
Yes, it looks like a pill, but in a good, minimal way. The speaker is super lightweight, featuring a soft-grip silicone backing that protects it from everyday wear and tear, plus a removable lanyard, which makes it easy to carry around. Slip it into a bag, or slide your fingers through the strap and get going.
You get the sound quality youâre paying for. Beats has packed it with a bigger, bespoke racetrack woofer that displaces 90% more air volume to deliver deeper, punchier bass. Pair this with the redesigned tweeter that captures highs and rich mid-range tones well, and youâll enjoy stable, balanced audio that doesnât distort, even when you have pumped the volume all the way up. Listening to the latest Coldplay album or just catching up on a Joe Rogan podcast, sound comes through with clarity and depth like never before.
Support for high-resolution lossless audio lets you enjoy tracks in their original form, as close as possible to what the creator intended. For this, just connect the speaker to your laptop or other compatible devices via a USB-C cable. Speaking of compatibility, even though Beats is an Apple brand, the Pill plays nicely with both Android and iOS devices. One-touch pairing keeps the process quick, and automatic pairing connects the unit to your most recently used device when it comes in range on its own. Thereâs a built-in microphone, too, that can be used to take quick calls right from the speaker, or to activate voice assistants like Alexa.
A single speaker is enough to keep a crowd entertained for hours, but for a bigger setup, you can always pair two of these together for twice the output experience in Amplify mode or Stereo mode. These let you have your own private concert right there in your backyard, with every beat being felt deep inside. The battery is designed to last up to 24 hours, which translates into at least a few nights of jamming and vibing. It even doubles as a power bank, letting you charge your phone or other devices via USB-C cable when in a pinch.
Outstanding durability is made possible with the IP67 dust and water resistance, which lets you keep the party going in all weather conditions. Rain, shine, beach sand, or a few water splashes by the pool wonât hurt it. The current deal brings the price down of this powerful speaker to $100, making the upgrade quite affordable. But itâs best to get your orders in quick, as the deal could expire any moment now.

The crypto market has entered December with a sharp momentum shift, as altcoins rebound in a clean V-shape pattern, Bitcoin flashes a historically rare bullish signal, and the Federal Reserve injects $13.5 billion in liquidity, the second-largest such operation since the COVID-19 pandemic.
Traders now want to know whether this cluster of catalysts marks the start of a full market reversal.
Altcoins are driving the December turnaround after one of the strongest 24-hour recoveries in months.
“Alts just printed a sharp V-shape recovery, erasing all the downside. In 24 hours, they’ve surged into the Warming Up quadrant, where rallies and breakouts ignite. But there’s one condition: BTC must stabilize and reclaim $93,500,” cautioned Altcoin Vector in a post.
The V-shape pattern historically appears ahead of broader trend reversals, but only if Bitcoin confirms the macro direction.
Several analysts believe a confirmation signal may already be forming. According to Gert van Lagen, Bitcoin’s monthly Bollinger Band Width has dipped below 100, a rare technical event that preceded every major Bitcoin parabolic leg in the past decade.
$BTC [1M] – Bollinger Band Width just dipped below 100 — flashing a rare green signal.Historically, every time this triggers, Bitcoin follows with a direct parabolic leg up.No red signal flashed in the previous months… pic.twitter.com/PoAM9hgHfV
If history repeats itself, Bitcoin may be preparing for its next major expansion phase, provided it can retake the $93,500 resistance level.
Social data from Santiment indicates a sharp increase in institutionally driven narratives across cryptocurrency platforms. Vanguard, managing $11 trillion, reversed its anti-crypto stance and opened Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana ETF trading to more than 50 million clients.
Bank of America followed by allowing advisers to recommend a 1%–4% crypto allocation starting January 2026.
“… [these developments] signal growing institutional acceptance and mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency,” Santiment noted.
Strong stablecoin inflows, including Tether’s $1 billion mint on Tron, and anticipation of Ethereum’s Fusaka upgrade are further supporting the early December rebound.

The most unexpected catalyst emerged on December 1, when the Federal Reserve injected $13.5 billion via an overnight repo. The move, which signaled tightening pressure within the financial system, was one of the largest liquidity injections since the COVID-19 pandemic.

The general sentiment is that this move could prevent further downside or boost short-term risk appetite” ahead of the December rate decision. Analyst Tracy Jin believes Bitcoin’s rebound was a direct response to the liquidity signal.
“In risk markets, ‘not tightening further’ is often enough to shift positioning,” she stated.
However, analyst Brett warned against assuming this is the start of quantitative easing, suggesting that it is a warning light inside the financial system.
""The Fed just injected $13.5 billion into the market as an overnight repo operation.

Banks borrow money from each… https://t.co/YNaOxpf7ll pic.twitter.com/mOuxAiE0PW
The market now hinges on whether Bitcoin can reclaim the critical $93,500 level. If BTC stabilizes and confirms the rare Bollinger Band signal, the early December V-shape bounce could evolve into a full reversal supported by liquidity, institutional flows, and seasonal strength.
If not, volatility may return as macro and liquidity conditions continue to shift.

When Ali Dastjerdi and Nathan Ondracek became freshman roommates at Harvard in 2015, they didn't expect they'd one day be cofounders together — or that they'd build a startup with a third friend they hadn't met yet.
Ondracek met Samuel Ilkka at AWS — his first job out of college — and the two bonded quickly and became roommates in Seattle. During the pandemic, Dastjerdi, who was working remotely as an investor at Insight Partners, moved in with them for a year. Working and living together cemented the three-way friendship.
In 2022, the trio quit their jobs to cofound Raylu, an AI startup that builds agents to help private-market investors automate sourcing work. On Monday, the company announced that it had raised $8 million in Series A funding, bringing its total funding to $12 million.
One of their earliest customers, HighlandX, led the round. The VC firm used the product, loved it, and eventually asked how they could invest, Dastjerdi said.
The Raylu team consists of 11 people, with plans to expand to 20 by January.
The three 28-year-olds told me that Raylu works because the friendship works. One of the ways they protect their friendship: a single, unopened beer in their office refrigerator.
""The day the company collapses is the day we drink that beer,"" Ondracek said.
It's a reminder that even if the company they built falls apart, their friendship is still worth toasting.
Ondracek and Dastjerdi met the way many college friendships begin. Harvard assigns freshman roommates after a 200-question survey, and the two ended up in the same room. ""From that point forward, we started becoming really close,"" Ondracek said. ""Ali was the best man at my wedding.""
They took the same classes — computer science and statistics — and stayed roommates for all four years. They spent late nights dreaming up business ideas, none of which stuck. But the urge to build something together did.
When Dastjerdi moved to Seattle with Ondracek and Ilkka, it was obvious to him that this was ""a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to build a company with two close friends that you think are truly brilliant.""
""Some people start companies because of ideas. I think we started a company because it's a one in a million shot to have this group to be able to start it with,"" Dastjerdi said.
The trio, now based in New York, works out of a WeWork office, and no longer lives together.
Mixing friendship and business usually comes with risks. But the three cofounders said the overlap didn't scare them.
Dastjerdi said he sought advice from a mentor who'd once started a company with his childhood best friend. The mentor asked him one question: ""If you and these two friends had just the biggest fight ever, what would happen the next day?
""I said probably nothing,"" Dastjerdi recalled. ""We would just get back to doing what we were doing."" The mentor said that was a good sign.
The trio said working together as best friends has upsides: They trust one another, reset fast after an argument, and know each other's strengths and weaknesses.
""It's like a little bit of a sibling relationship,"" Ondracek said, explaining that disgruntlement doesn't lead to lasting animosity.
When I asked the trio to describe one another, their dynamic snapped into focus. Ilkka said Dastjerdi brings ""urgency"" and an understanding of the investing world, and he called Ondracek the ""best engineer"" he knows. Dastjerdi described Ilkka as the team's optimist and risk taker.
The cofounders said their dynamic has changed after starting a business together.
Dastjerdi said one of the hardest adjustments for him was remembering how to be a ""regular friend"" outside work. Because ""99%"" of his thoughts revolve around the company, he's had to build what he calls a ""mental firewall"" to keep cofounder mode from bleeding into friend mode.
Trust has also become non-negotiable. For Ikka, he has had to learn not to look over their shoulders as much when they're working. ""I can either stress about everything, or I can trust these guys I'm working with to handle their weight,"" he said.
They've learned to celebrate wins more deliberately — especially because they're doing this not just as founders, but as friends.
""You have to celebrate the good things because no one's going to celebrate them for you,"" Ondracek said.
The founders say their journey has taught them a few valuable lessons worth sharing.
Ondracek said what matters most for a startup is its people.
""Nothing works if the people don't work,"" Ondracek said. ""You can have the most product market fit, and if the people don't work, you're doomed from the start,"" he added.
Dastjerdi said founders shouldn't fall in love with an idea too early.
""We went through many iterations where it felt like someone kind of liked what we did,"" he said. ""When we actually found product-market-fit, it is so tangibly different. It's like, people have to rip the product from you.""
Keep iterating, be picky, and pivot more — sometimes that could lead to a bigger win, he added.
Ilkka warned against rushing into the founder path just because other people are starting young. The right time is when you're ready, and when there's a real purpose driving the decision, he said.
And if you're building with your best friends? Make sure you still want to open a beer together when everything goes south.

Karen Wheeler has been a part of the Hawkins scene since the very first season of Stranger Things, but aside from her flirtations with Max’s lifeguarding brother Billy, she’s mostly been a background player. She’s Nancy, Mike, and Holly’s mom, and she’s been supportive/scolding of them as the story requires. The first part of season five, however, saw Karen step up in a big way when one of Vecna‘s minions paid a visit to her home intent on snatching her youngest daughter into the Upside Down.
This is not just any family home; this is where the famous basement is located, where Mike, Will, Dustin, and Lucas discovered their shared love of Dungeons & Dragons. But Karen’s mostly been on the fringes of Stranger Things‘ monster mashing until nowâwhen we see her put up a hell of a fight, brandishing her weapon of choice: a broken wine bottle, something that also happens to represent her coping mechanism of choice.
Speaking to the Hollywood Reporter, Cara Buono, who plays Karen, spoke about the character’s evolution so farâand teased a tiny bit about what’s to come.
“I love the physical transformation that happens for Karen, which I think youâll really get a kick out of,” Buono said. We’re intrigued. But we also want to hear more about the Karen we’ve seen so far in season five.
“[In season five], suddenly Karenâs thrust into the unbelievable,” Buono said. “This whole time, sheâs been in denial and drinking her wine. One of the ways I justified her being the quintessential clueless â80s mom was by asking for her to be drinking as often as possible.”
As for her preferred beverage, Buono said it’s white wine. “Because her rug is white in the living room and she doesnât want to spill. Itâs a little less of a hangover than red. I would say, chardonnay. Â I always said sheâs kind of a high-functioning closet alcoholic. It was my way to try to justify the immense denial and cluelessness that she embodied.”
Hawkins is under military lockdown in season five, but as we see with younger characters as they gather supplies for their radio station, there’s a thriving black market. That’s how Karen gets her own supplies, Buono explained.
“Karen knows where to get the wine,” she said. “Sheâs focused on the wine, maybe some nail polish, and thereâs someone whoâs got a truck coming in with all that. I created a whole world of accessing the contraband. Sheâs smoking cigarettes in the garage, waiting. Because she also has mascara! That was really important to me.”
However, as Buonoâwho has worn a variety of wigs throughout Stranger Thingsâwill admit, Karen’s hair has seen better days: “It gets a little sad looking in season five because theyâre under quarantine without a lot of access to the good hair products.” Those “hiding underwater” heroics also take a toll on her curls.
We’re pulling for you, Mrs. Wheeler! Stranger Things returns with more episodes December 25 and 31.

Bitcoin plunges 32% from October peak as MicroStrategy faces potential forced selling of 650,000 coins amid liquidity crisis

Forget everything you know about Bitcoin‘s December performance. While the world’s largest cryptocurrency typically delivers holiday cheer—finishing positive roughly half the time with average gains of 29.7%—this December tells a different story. Bitcoin crashed to $85,461 early in the month, marking a brutal 32% plunge from its October peak of $126,200. Your crypto portfolio’s Christmas wishes just got coal instead of gains.
Multiple structural failures converged to create Bitcoin’s worst December setup in years.
The sell-off isn’t random—it’s a perfect storm of interconnected failures. Market analysts have noted that Bitcoin has become shamefully correlated with tech stocks, creating feedback loops where leveraged traders dump both assets simultaneously when risk sentiment sours.
Bank of Japan officials triggered yen carry trade unwinding fears, echoing August 2024’s devastating market correction when BoJ signals sparked severe global volatility. Liquidity evaporated faster than your faith in “digital gold”—market depth collapsed 25% since October while investors yanked $3.5 billion from Bitcoin ETFs in November alone. Meanwhile, investors continue paying too much for various financial products during these uncertain times.
“The pressure across markets intensified because the order book was shallow and the market lacked sufficient depth to withstand another macroeconomic liquidity shock,” warns Farzam Ehsani, CEO of crypto exchange VALR.
The corporate Bitcoin champion faces a potential forced-selling scenario that could crater prices another 30%.
Here’s where things get truly terrifying. MicroStrategy—the company that pioneered corporate Bitcoin adoption—sits on 650,000 coins (3% of total supply) but faces a metric called mNAV hovering dangerously at 1.2. If this ratio drops below 1.0, CEO Phong Le admitted the company would “sell bitcoin” as a “last resort.”
That’s not corporate posturing—it’s a loaded gun pointed at the market. Ehsani estimates such selling could trigger another 30% decline, potentially dragging Bitcoin to $60,000. Meanwhile, according to Arkham Intel estimates (which the firm acknowledges may contain a ~3% margin of error), MicroStrategy may have already quietly reduced holdings from 484,000 to 437,000 coins this month. In contrast, major institutional investors are focusing on projects like the $500 billion Stargate initiative.
The Fear and Greed Index screams “Extreme Fear” at 23 out of 100, while technical analysts predict Bitcoin will barely recover this month. In essence, your crypto investment thesis about uncorrelated digital gold just collided with reality’s meat grinder, revealing Bitcoin as another risk asset dancing to Wall Street’s tune.

Things are finally looking up for Tesla in China.
The US automaker's sales rose 9.9% in November compared to the same month last year, according to data released by China's Passenger Car Association on Tuesday.
That's a rare win for Tesla, which has had a difficult year in almost all of its biggest markets. The company has faced a sales collapse in Europe, been squeezed by intense competition in EV-friendly China, and is on track to see its overall sales decline for the second consecutive year.
One bright spot for Tesla: it's not the only one with problems. The Elon Musk-run automaker's biggest Chinese rival, BYD, has hit some speed bumps in recent months.
The Shenzhen-based EV giant, which has become one of China's largest carmakers thanks to a range of affordable and high-tech electric models, has had three straight months of sales declines.
BYD said it sold just over 480,000 EVs and hybrids in November, its highest total this year, but still around 5.3% less than the same period in 2024.
The Chinese automaker, which was once backed by Warren Buffett, has struggled in the face of a renewed price war in China's ultra-competitive EV market and a government crackdown on aggressive discounting.
Despite these headwinds, BYD is still on course to take Tesla's crown as the world's largest seller of battery EVs this year, and the company is rapidly taking market share from Musk and co. outside China.
BYD's overseas sales hit a record 131,935 in November. The Chinese auto giant is taking advantage of Tesla's woes in Europe, with BYD outselling its US rival by more than two to one in October.

18,2025-12-03,"Ken Griffin's stockpickers are using an internal chatbot to speed up their processes and find new info at his $71 billion hedge fund.
The tool, rolled out earlier this year, helps the firm's legions of fundamental equity investors find hidden details in public filings, summarize research from sell-side banks, track mentions of certain key words from executives, and more.
But the human part of these flesh-and-blood traders remains mission critical, according to Umesh Subramanian, Citadel's chief technology officer.
Speaking at a New York conference on Wednesday, he said, ""We are also careful that it's not used in the wrong way.""
""We don't want PMs offloading their human investment judgment to AI. This is a tool to further accelerate their research process,"" he said.
Citadel is far from the only hedge fund with an internal chat tool. Managers such as Balyasny, Man Group, Viking Global, and more have rolled out AI helpers to assist their investment teams. Citadel had already been using AI or machine learning in some form for roughly a decade.
But decision-making has yet to be turned over wholesale to the machines, aside from a few funds, such as Bridgewater, which is allowing AI to run a strategy uninhibited by people. Even quant fund managers — which trade markets using systematic, computer-run strategies — believe humans are still a critical part of investing.
At Citadel, employees aren't forced to use AI, Subramanian told Business Insider in an interview.
""We don't have a requirement to use AI, just like we don't go around saying you are required to use Java as a programming language. That's backward,"" he said. The new tool has close to full adoption across stock-picking teams, the firm says.
While companies like Microsoft and Shopify have mandated the use of AI by their employees, Subramanian said, ""Where that goes wrong is adopting AI for the sake of adoption, rather than because it's actually needed.""
""That is a slippery slope,"" he said.

20,2025-12-03,"Members of Congress continue to trade individual stocks even as they shape legislative agendas and gain access to non-public information. New research sheds light on how political power affects financial outcomes and underscores the need for reforms that draw a firm line between public office and private profit.
 NEW YORK – When members of the United States Congress regularly play the stock market, should we really be surprised when they come out ahead? More than 100 US senators and members of the House of Representatives traded stocks in 2024. While the practice is legal, it is fueling public outrage – and for good reason. 
 The 2012 STOCK Act was designed to curb investment-related conflicts of interest, but several high-profile incidents have cast serious doubt on its effectiveness. Consider, for example, the four US senators who sold off shares immediately after a closed-door COVID-19 briefing in early 2020, just in time to avoid the subsequent market crash. 
 In a recent paper, Yifan Zhou and I examined congressional stock trading. We set out to answer a simple but critical question: Do US lawmakers – especially those in leadership positions – actually earn outsize returns, and if so, why? 
 Our analysis focused on the gap between congressional leaders – speakers, caucus leaders, whips, and committee chairs – and rank-and-file members. This distinction is important because leadership doesn’t just come with a bigger office; it confers agenda-setting power, access to closed-door briefings, and information that can move markets. Using data from 1995 to 2021, we tracked trades by every member of Congress who rose to a leadership position and compared their returns with those of “regular” lawmakers with similar backgrounds. 
 Before entering leadership roles (the “year zero” in the figure below), future leaders and their non-leader counterparts performed about the same, and neither group beat the market. But once members moved into leadership positions, their trading performance changed dramatically. On average, leaders outperformed non-leaders by up to 47 percentage points per year.  
 This remarkable turnaround can be traced to two distinct forms of access. The first is the political information and influence channel. Leaders know earlier – and in greater detail – which bills will advance or stall, which regulations are being drafted, and which industries may soon come under increased scrutiny. That informational edge alone can translate into higher investment returns.

 The second channel is access to corporate information. Corporations naturally seek to curry favor with powerful politicians. While sharing non-public, material information – say, about a research and development breakthrough – is illegal, providing selective updates, strategic context, or executive insights can still shape expectations. And when firms decide whom to brief or court, congressional leaders who can make or break legislation are the most obvious choices.  
 After they reached leadership roles, lawmakers earned significantly higher returns on trades involving companies that donated to their campaigns or were headquartered in their home states. Leaders’ access to non-public information is a far more plausible explanation for such returns than luck. 
 Notably, leaders’ returns rose sharply when their party controlled the chamber, suggesting that greater institutional power translates into trading gains. Their stock sales also anticipated regulatory actions, such as Securities and Exchange Commission investigations and congressional hearings, months before they became public knowledge. 
 These effects were not confined to individual trades. After a leader bought shares in a company, members of their party became more likely to vote for bills that benefited that firm and vote against bills that could harm it. This pattern suggests that, at least in some cases, party discipline may be used to protect leaders’ financial interests. 
 Even more striking, firms whose stocks leaders purchased received more federal contracts – especially no-bid contracts. In other words, leaders weren’t merely forecasting policy outcomes; they may have been influencing those outcomes in ways that aligned with their investment portfolios. 
 Once in leadership, lawmakers seemed to develop an uncanny knack for predicting major corporate news: positive announcements tended to follow their stock purchases, and negative developments often followed their sales. Nothing in their pre-leadership records suggested they possessed any such skill. 
 To be sure, this does not mean that every congressional leader is cashing in on non-public information. But these trends should alarm anyone who cares about fair markets and accountable government. 
 One promising solution, recently proposed by a bipartisan group of House representatives, is to ban stock trading by sitting members of Congress. Many other democracies already restrict or prohibit legislators from owning individual stocks. The US should do the same. Even in today’s polarized landscape, one principle should be beyond dispute: elected officials should not be playing the markets while writing the rules that govern them.

Even as aging populations leave the workforce and critical sectors scramble for talent, an anti-immigrant backlash is gathering force across much of the developed world. The result is a widening gap between economic fundamentals and policy choices that threatens long-term growth and prosperity.
New technologies offer new opportunities to revamp payment and credit systems, making them not only more efficient but also safer. It would be a shame if these were foregone because banks believe that they have a right to a business model that they inherited from political compromises struck centuries ago.

European Traffic Education Seminar 2025
Experts in leading medical journal condemn the rise of SUVs, citing critical public health and safety risks
EU officials must revisit the hastily agreed trade deal with the US, where the EU stated that it “intends to accept” lower US vehicle standards, say cities – including Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam, and more than 75 civil society organisations. In a letter to European lawmakers, the signatories warn that aligning European standards with laxer rules in the US would undermine the EU’s global leadership in road safety, public health, climate policy and competitiveness. 
Road Safety
The deal agreed over summer states that “with respect to automobiles, the United States and the European Union intend to accept and provide mutual recognition to each other’s standards.” Yet, EU vehicle safety regulations have supported a 36% reduction in European road deaths since 2010. By contrast, road deaths in the US over the same period increased 30%, with pedestrian deaths up 80% and cyclist deaths up 50%.
Europe currently has mandatory requirements for life-saving technologies, such as pedestrian protection, automated emergency braking and lane-keeping assistance. Some of the most basic pedestrian protection requirements which have long been in place in the EU, such as deformation zones in the front of vehicles to reduce crash severity and the prohibition of sharp edges have made cars like the Tesla Cybertruck illegal to sell in Europe.
“Europe built its reputation on pioneering robust vehicle standards.To accept lower US standards would undo decades of EU progress,” say the signatories. According to the letter “the consequences of such a move for European road safety would be profound.“
European air quality & health at risk
The EU is set to apply limits to harmful pollution from brake and tyre wear from 2026 onwards, while at the same time the US is moving to weaken air pollution rules for vehicles. Accepting weaker US standards would increase European exposure to pollutants linked to asthma, cancer and numerous cardiovascular and neurological conditions, warn the signatories.
Jobs threat in Europe
Major EU brands such as BMW, Mercedes and Stellantis already build large numbers of vehicles in US automotive plants to EU standards – particularly larger SUVs. However, if the lower US vehicle standards are accepted in Europe, these production lines could produce vehicles to these US lower standards, before shipping these vehicles to the EU. Overall, vehicle production would shift from the EU to the US. To accept lower US car standards would risk large-scale job losses in EU car plants and across Europe’s automotive supply chain. 
Existing import loopholes must be closed
The European Commission is already working to tighten Individual Vehicle Approval (IVA), which is being abused to put thousands of oversized US pick-up trucks on EU streets without complying with core EU safety, air pollution and climate standards. To now accept lower US vehicle standards across the board would open the floodgates to US pick-ups and large SUVs.
The signatories urge EU lawmakers to oppose the intention to accept lower US vehicle standards in the EU–US Joint Statement and affirm publicly that EU vehicle standards are non-negotiable.

22,2025-12-03,"Apple is preparing to bring support for its digital car key feature to select Audi vehicles in China, based on evidence uncovered by MacRumors on Apple's backend.
Specifically, the car key support relates to Audi's partnership with Chinese company FAW, which manufactures and sells Audi vehicles in the Chinese market. The joint venture produces both combustion engine and all-electric vehicles. The partnership is now on an internal Apple list of vehicles that offer car key integration, but it is not known which models the support pertains to. 
Last month, car key support was implemented for models produced by SAIC-Audi, another China-based collaboration that produces Audi EVs in the country. For car key to come to Audi vehicles, the automotive company will need to add the functionality.
Introduced in 2022, Car Keys allows an iPhone or Apple Watch to unlock a vehicle through the Wallet app. A digital version of a car key is stored in Wallet, and unlocking can be done by holding an Apple Watch or ‌iPhone‌ near a compatible vehicle's NFC reader.
A tap on the door handle is enough to initiate an unlock, and while Face ID authentication is a security option, Apple offers an Express Mode that eliminates the need to authenticate for a faster unlocking process.
At WWDC 2025, Apple confirmed that 13 vehicle brands would ""soon"" add support for digital car keys, and Audi was on the list. Other brands included were Acura, Porsche, GMC, Cadillac,  Chevrolet, Rivian, Smart, Lucid Motors, Tata Motors, Hongqi, WEY, Chery, and Voyah.
Vehicles from BMW, Genesis, Kia, Hyundai, Lotus, Mercedes, Volvo, and more offer car keys support, with a list available on MacRumors.com.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

The Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales have come and gone, but I just noticed one historic Google Pixel 10 deal that has no signs of stopping. Grab the AI-powered flagship unlocked from Amazon right now and you'll score a straight 31% discount. That knocks the price of the phone down to only $549, no strings attached!
To be fair, this Pixel 10 discount is far from the only deal leftover from Amazon's Cyber Monday sale, but it's easily one of the most remarkable. For a little context, this popular Android phone was only discounted to $599 during Black Friday itself, which means you're currently saving $50 more than its previously-recorded record low price. I'm not sure why Amazon decided to drop such a significant discount after the biggest sale of the year, but I'm not about to start complaining. 
Google Pixel 10 128GB: $799 $549 at Amazon
Did you miss all of the fun during Black Friday and Cyber Monday? You're in luck: Amazon is still carving a straight 31% off the Google Pixel 10, knocking the phone down to its lowest price ever. This 2025 flagship comes packed with a powerful Tensor chip, versatile camera tech, and all of the latest AI-powered software tricks. 
Feature-packed and endlessly versatile, the Google Pixel 10 boasts an elegant design with a 6.3-inch OLED display, durable Gorilla Glass Victus 2 and IP68 construction, and an upgraded telephoto lens. 
Under the hood you get the powerful Google Tensor G5 processor (the same chip that powers the Pro models), 12GB of RAM, and all of the latest AI-boosted software features that the OEM is becoming known for. You also get the convenience of Qi2 charging support, and like many of the best Android phones on the market, seven years of OS and security upgrades guaranteed. 
On the other hand, if you can find a good deal, the Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL are undoubtedly better devices, and no Google phone is properly optimized for high-intensity mobile gaming. That being said, the Pixel 10 is a phone that's good at, well, being a phone, and it comes packed full of enough convenient features and AI trickery to keep you invested for years to come.

After a brief delay, OnePlus has finally announced the pre-order date and the freebies that will come with OnePlus 15 pre-orders in the U.S.
The OnePlus 15 launched on November 13, 2025, in global markets. However, the phone skipped its U.S. launch. The company confirmed that the delay was due to the phone not receiving FCC approval before launch because of the government shutdown that lasted from October 1, 2025, to November 12, 2025.
Thankfully, we learned last week that the FCC clearance had come through and OnePlus would officially launch the phone in the U.S. soon. The company has now announced that the OnePlus 15 will be available for pre-orders starting December 4, 2025 (Thursday) on OnePlus' official website.
The company hasn't announced the exact shipping date or open-sale date yet, but it should happen sometime next week if things follow the usual pattern. Still, for anyone planning to buy the OnePlus 15 in the U.S., the company is offering some generous freebies with pre-orders.
In the U.S., if you pre-order a OnePlus 15, you'll be able to choose one of the following four add-ons for free:
OnePlus notes that these freebies come in limited stock and are first-come, first-served. Of course, if you want the best-value OnePlus Watch 3, you might have to act fast since that freebie will likely sell out first.
 



In addition, OnePlus is also offering trade-in deals on the OnePlus 15. You can trade in any smartphone in any condition and get $100 credit. The company will also offer a $100 cashback bonus when you purchase with a trade-in.

These are some of the strongest discounts you'll see on the OnePlus 15, and with the holiday season coming up, it might be the perfect time to upgrade.
For those wondering about the base variant, the OnePlus 15 will retail for $900 when pre-orders go live. Alongside that, you'll be able to grab the free earbuds, AirVOOC charger, or magnetic case.

Reserve your seat to see where your brand stands in the 2026 AI search race.
Treating search visibility as digital capital turns SEO from a cost center into a compounding asset that drives sustainable business performance.
Every month, companies lose millions in unrealized search value not because their teams stopped optimizing, but because they stopped seeing where visibility converts into economic return.
When search performance drops, most teams chase rankings. The real leaders chase equity.
This is the Search Equity Gap – the measurable delta between the organic market share your brand once held and what it holds today.
 In most organizations, this gap isn’t tracked or budgeted for. Yet it represents one of the most consistent and compounding forms of digital opportunity cost. Every unclaimed click isn’t just lost traffic; it’s lost demand at the lowest acquisition cost possible – an invisible tax on growth.
When we treat SEO as a channel, we chase traffic.
When we treat it as an equity engine, we reclaim value.
Search equity is the accumulated advantage your brand earns when visibility, authority, and user trust align. Like financial equity, it compounds over time – links build reputation, content earns citations, and user engagement reinforces relevance.
But the opposite is also true: When migrations break URLs, when content fragments across markets, or when AI overviews intercept clicks, that equity erodes.
And that’s usually the moment when management suddenly discovers the value of organic search – right after it vanishes.
What was once dismissed as “free traffic” becomes an expensive emergency as other channels scramble to compensate for the lost opportunity. Paid budgets balloon, acquisition costs spike, and leadership learns that SEO isn’t a faucet you can turn back on.
Search equity isn’t just about rankings. It’s about discoverability at scale – ensuring your brand appears, is understood, and is chosen in every relevant search context, from classic results to AI-generated overviews.
In this new environment, visibility without qualification is meaningless. A million impressions that never convert are not an asset. The opportunity lies in reclaiming qualified visibility – the type that drives revenue, reduces acquisition costs, and compounds shareholder value.
Every SEO audit can uncover technical or content issues. But the deeper cause of declining performance often stems from three systemic leaks.
Migrations, redesigns, and rebrands remain the biggest equity destroyers in enterprise SEO. When URLs change without proper mapping, Google’s understanding of authority resets. Internal link equity splinters. Canonical signals conflict.
Each broken or redirected page acts like a severed artery in your digital system – small losses multiplied at scale. What seems like a simple platform refresh can erase years of accumulated search trust.
Even when nothing changes internally, the ecosystem around you continues to evolve. Zero-click results, AI Overviews, and new answer formats siphon attention. Search visibility remains, but user behavior no longer translates into traffic.
The new challenge isn’t “ranking first.” It’s being chosen when the user’s question is answered before they click. This demands a shift from keyword optimization to intent satisfaction and requires restructuring your content, data, and experience for discoverability and decision influence.
Perhaps the most corrosive leak of all: misalignment. When SEO sits in marketing, IT in technology, and analytics in finance, nobody owns the whole system.
Executives’ fund rebrands that destroy crawl efficiency. Paid teams buy traffic that good content could have earned. Each department optimizes its own key performance indicator (KPI), and in doing so, the organization loses cohesion. Search equity collapses not because of algorithms, but because of organizational architecture. The fix starts at the top.
Most companies estimate what they should earn in search and compare it to current performance. But in volatile, AI-driven SERPs, real performance deltas tell the truer story.
Instead of modeling potential, this approach uses before-and-after data – actual performance metrics from both pre-impact and current states. By doing so, you measure realized loss, click erosion, and intent displacement with precision.
Search Equity Gap = Lost Qualified Traffic + Lost Discoverability + Lost Intent Coverage
Pull your data from a stable window before the event (typically three to six months prior).
From Google Search Console and analytics, extract:
This becomes your search equity portfolio – the measurable value of your earned discoverability.
Run the same data for the current period and align query-to-page pairs.
Then classify each outcome:
This comparison reveals both visibility loss and click erosion, clarifying where and why your equity declined.
Link each pattern to its primary driver:
These map to equity types:
This triage converts diagnosis into a prioritized investment plan.
For each equity type, calculate:
Lost Value = Δ Clicks × Conversion Rate × Value per Conversion
Add a Paid Substitution Cost to translate organic loss into a financial figure:
Cost of Not Ranking = Lost Clicks × Avg CPC
This ties the forensic analysis directly to your legacy framework, which I define as The Cost of Not Ranking, and shows executives the tangible price of underperformance.
Example:
Now your analysis quantifies both organic value lost and capital inefficiency created.
Not all loss deserves recovery. Patterns surface quickly:
Plot these on a Search Equity Impact Matrix – potential value vs. effort – to direct resources toward recoverable, high-margin opportunities.
Most SEO reports describe position snapshots. Few reveal equity trajectories. By grounding analysis in actuals before and after impact, you replace speculation with measurable evidence that data executives can trust. This reframes search optimization as loss prevention and value recovery, not traffic chasing.
Traditional metrics focus on activity:
Value-based metrics focus on performance and economics:
Integrating your Cost of Not Ranking logic further amplifies this.
Every click you have to buy is a symptom of a ranking you didn’t earn.
By comparing your paid and organic data for the same query set, you can see how much budget covers for lost equity and how much could be redeployed if organic recovery occurred.
When teams present SEO performance in these financial terms, they gain executive attention and budget alignment.
Example:
“Replacing lost organic share with paid clicks costs $480,000 per quarter. Fixing canonical and internal-link issues can recover 70% of that value within 90 days.”
That’s not an SEO report. That’s a business case for digital capital recovery.
Search equity recovery follows the same progression as digital value creation – diagnose, quantify, prioritize, and institutionalize.
Compare actual performance pre- and post-impact. Visualize equity at risk by category or market.
Layer crawl data, analytics, and competitive intelligence to isolate technical, behavioral, and AI factors.
Focus on qualified clicks from mid- and late-funnel intents where AI summaries mention your brand but don’t link to you.
Answer those queries more directly. Reinforce them with structured data and content relationships that signal expertise and trust.
Embed SEO governance into development, design, and content workflows. Optimization becomes a process, not a project – or, as I’ve written before, infrastructure, not tactic. When governance becomes muscle memory, equity doesn’t just recover; it compounds.
Executives often ask:
“How much revenue does SEO drive?”
The better question is:
“How much value are we losing by not treating search as infrastructure?”
The search equity gap quantifies that blind spot. It reframes SEO from a cost-justified marketing function into a value-restoration system – one that preserves and grows digital capital over time. Each recovered visit is a visit you no longer need to buy. Each resolved structural issue accelerates time-to-value for every future campaign.
Ironically, the surest way to make executives appreciate SEO is to let it break once. Nothing clarifies its importance faster than the sound of paid budgets doubling to make up for “free” traffic that suddenly disappeared. That’s how SEO evolves from an acquisition channel to a shareholder-value lever.
The companies dominating search today aren’t publishing more content – they’re protecting and compounding their equity more effectively.
They’ve built digital balance sheets that grow through governance, not guesswork. The rest are still chasing algorithm updates while silently losing market share in the one channel that could deliver the highest margin growth.
The search equity gap isn’t a ranking problem. It’s a visibility-to-value disconnect, and closing it starts by measuring what most teams never even notice.

The officially licensed Capcom editions of the Evercade Alpha Bartop Arcade had been sold out since the beginning of the year.
By 
    Steven Petite

 Evercade Alpha Bartop Arcade - Street Fighter Edition 
 $280 
 Evercade Alpha Bartop Arcade - Mega Man Edition 
 $280 
 
The Mega Man and Street Fighter editions of the Evercade Alpha Bartop Arcade are back in stock at Amazon after being sold out in the US practically all year. The restock arrives just one week after Blaze Entertainment launched the new Taito edition in the US. Officially licensed by Capcom, the Street Fighter and Mega Man countertop cabinets launched last November and then disappeared from Amazon in early 2025. All three Alpha Bartop Arcades retail for $280 and are shipped/sold by Solutions 2 Go, which is now the official distributor for the Alpha in the US. The Taito edition is temporarily out of stock at Amazon.
The two Evercade Alpha Capcom editions have six preloaded games each, while the Taito edition has 10 games. These cartridge-based countertop arcade machines support Evercade's expansive catalog of retro game collections. Over a dozen additional digital games can be unlocked in the Evercade OS Secret menu. Heads up: Amazon has limited-time deals on over a dozen Evercade cartridges, but these deals end December 4 at 12 AM PT. Amazon's deals on the Super Pocket retro handhelds end tonight, too.
 
Here's a rundown of the specs for all three cabinets. Outside of the exterior artwork and preloaded games, the only tangible difference between the three cabinets is the arcade stick. Both Capcom editions have bat-top sticks, while the Taito version has a ball-top stick.
Key Specs:
The Street Fighter edition features the Street Fighter II: Champion Edition logo on the gray marquee and blue side panels. The granite-like marquee and control deck will be familiar to anyone who has played a full-size Street Fighter II: Champion Edition cabinet.
6 preloaded games:
The artwork on the Mega Man model is themed around Mega Man: The Power Battle, a spin-off fighting game that launched in Japanese arcades in 1995. You may be familiar with The Power Battle if you've played Capcom Arcade 2nd Stadium or spent time in Street Fighter 6's Game Center. 
The Power Battle and its sequel The Power Fighters are joined by a few other classic Capcom games, including Strider and Final Fight.
 
6 preloaded games:
 
The Taito edition has a colorful Bubble Bobble theme and features 10 classics, including Space Invaders and Puzzle Bobble (and Bubble Bobble, of course).
10 preloaded games:
 
The build quality of the Evercade Alpha is superb. The Alpha's 8-inch IPS screen produces a crisp and vibrant image, and the stick/buttons are nicer than any other arcade cabinet we've tried in this price range. The custom Evercade OS is clean and easy to use. Thanks to its extremely lightweight design--the Alpha is roughly 13 pounds--it's easy to move to different places in your house. You can even use it comfortably on the couch by propping the cabinet on your lap.
Since the Evercade library has hundreds of console and handheld games, you may want to use a regular controller sometimes. Out of the box, the Alpha only supports wired USB controllers. If you want to use a wireless controller, you'll need an adapter. With the 8BitDo USB Wireless Adapter 2, you can use a wide variety of Bluetooth gamepads, including PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch controllers as well as most of 8BitDo's Bluetooth controllers. Numerous third-party arcade sticks (wired and wireless) are also compatible, so both players can use traditional arcade controls for multiplayer games.
For more on the Evercade Alpha hardware, we'd recommend reading our in-depth review of the Mega Man edition published last year. If you like the concept of Evercade but don't want to spend $280, check out Amazon's limited-time deals on HyperMegaTech Super Pockets. These budget-friendly handhelds have a Game Boy Pocket-esque form factor, a cartridge slot for Evercade collections, and are preloaded with a dozen or more games Four Super Pocket editions are still on sale after Cyber Monday, but these deals end December 3.
 
In total, the Evercade platform has 80 cartridge collections and nearly 700 games--not including preloaded and secret games. The arcade series accounts for 21 of those cartridges, including new and upcoming Taito and Neo Geo collections. The arcade game catalog features 166 games so far. The console series is much larger--49 cartridges and 415 games--and the home computer lineup is the newest of the three with 10 cartridges and 107 games. Most Evercade carts retail for $30 these days and are themed around specific retro publishers, platforms, and franchises. Roughly 20% of the library focuses on contemporary indie games with retro-inspired visuals and gameplay. 
Evercade Cartridge Collection deals
As mentioned, some of Amazon's Black Friday deals on Evercade cartridge collections are still available as of December 2. All but two of the cartridges listed below are on sale for $24 (was $30). The other two carts on this list--Thalamus and Gremlin Collections--are available for $20 each.
These deals end December 4 at 12 AM PT / 3 AM ET:

Comcast’s Board of Directors approved the separation of the company’s cable television networks and complementary digital platforms from its remaining businesses to create an independent, publicly traded company called Versant Media Group in early January.

	The spinoff has been a year in the making and comes as the Philadelphia-based media giant is bidding to acquire the studio and streaming businesses of Warner Bros. Discovery amid a massive transformation of the media landscape.

	It will trade on the Nasdaq under the stock symbol VSNT. Versant executives will introduce the company to Wall Street and the press at an investor day event in New York on Thursday. The dramatic decision to split was a reflection of the declining value of linear television amid then rise of streaming and cord cutting. Soon after Comcast announced its plans, WBS also decided to separate its global networks from studios and streaming, something it plans to pursue if a sale doesn’t pan out. Paramount and Netflix are also bidding to by WBD in whole or part.

	It outlined the mechanics of the split, which will be achieved through a pro rata distribution of 100% of the outstanding shares of Versant Class A common stock and Versant Class B common stock to the holders of Comcast Class A common stock and Comcast Class B common stock. 




			Watch on Deadline		






	Comcast shareholders will receive one share of Versant Class A common stock or Versant Class B common stock for every 25 shares of Comcast Class A common stock or Comcast Class B common stock, respectively, held at the close of business on the record date of December 16.

	The distribution of Versant shares is expected to be completed after the close of trading on Nasdaq on January 2.

	Fractional shares of Versant common stock will not be distributed. Any fractional share of Versant Class A common stock otherwise issuable to a holder of Comcast Class A common stock will be sold in the open market on such shareholder’s behalf, and such holder will receive a cash payment for the fractional share based on its pro rata portion of the net cash proceeds from all sales of fractional shares.

	










	Prior to the distribution, Comcast expects to deliver an information statement to all shareholders entitled to receive the distribution. The information statement will describe Versant, including the risks of owning Versant common stock and other details regarding the separation.

	It said the completion of the distribution “is subject to a number of customary conditions, including that no event or development will have occurred or exist that, in the judgment of the Board, in its sole discretion, makes it inadvisable to effect the distribution.”

	Comcast expects to receive an opinion from its tax advisor confirming the tax-free status of the separation to Comcast and its shareholders.

	It expects that a “when-issued” public trading market for Versant Class A common stock will start on or about December 15 under the symbol VSNTV, and will continue through the distribution date. Comcast also anticipates that “regular-way” trading of Versant Class A common stock will begin on January 5, the first formal trading day following the distribution date.

	Following the distribution, Versant will be an independent, publicly traded company. 

	Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley  are serving as financial advisors to Comcast, and Davis Polk & Wardwell as legal counsel.

We've been entertaining Exynos 2600 rumors for a while, but now Samsung is starting to officially tease the new chip.
Samsung recently published a teaser trailer for its next in-house chip, the Exynos 2600, on YouTube. The South Korean OEM's video is rather short, only coming in at 30 seconds, but this brief clip offers a subtle glimpse into what we might expect. Samsung opens its teaser by stating, ""In silence, we listened,"" likely referring to the various grievances Galaxy users have had over the years with its Exynos chips.
The company then goes on to make two big, dare we say, promises about the upcoming Exynos chip.
Samsung says the Exynos 2600 has been ""refined at the core,"" before rolling into another statement stating optimizations have arrived ""at every level."" The company is really trying to stoke the hype flames this year with the Exynos 2600, adding that the new chip is designed to ""express the exceptional"" in its devices, and likely its users. Unfortunately, Samsung doesn't offer anything with more substance about the chip, like something we can really dig into.
However, the company's description box held more, as it says, ""The next Exynos is coming."" Samsung highlights that the chip is ""coming soon,"" which might feed into the rumors that it will be placed into the Galaxy S26.
We've been going through Exynos 2600 rumors like nobody's business, but they claim one thing: that it's going to be snappy. Rumors in October make the claim that Samsung's new in-house chip will thrust it into contention with chips from Apple and Qualcomm. Supposedly, the company has taken strides to improve the speed of the Exynos 2600, producing a snappier and graphically stronger SoC for its Galaxy phones.
We've also heard repeated rumors that the chip is built on Samsung's 2nm process, not 3nm, which you'd get from TSMC for Qualcomm's Snapdragon. AI was another object of discussion, as Samsung will look to really force its AI software onto the Exynos 2600, improving its performance to ""surpass"" Apple.

Just last month, it was speculated that Samsung's Exynos 2600 could bring a small price drop to the chip's target series: the Galaxy S26. Supposedly, the regions that could see the chip (Korea, Europe) might see a ~$20 to ~$30 price drop. There were reportedly concerns about the chip's true power potential on smartphones, despite Samsung rocking its 2nm process.
Performance has always been a concern with Samsung's Exynos chip; just look at the struggles it had with its 2500 series. There's also the fact that Samsung, when it does utilize its Exynos chip, shies away from a U.S. Galaxy launch with the chip due to market perception, as most lean toward Qualcomm's Snapdragon.

From the MBA: Mortgage Applications Decrease in Latest MBA Weekly SurveyMortgage applications decreased 1.4 percent from one
week earlier, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association’s (MBA) Weekly Mortgage
Applications Survey for the week ending November 28, 2025. This week’s results include an adjustment
for the Thanksgiving holiday.

The Market Composite Index, a measure of mortgage loan application volume, decreased 1.4 percent on
a seasonally adjusted basis from one week earlier. On an unadjusted basis, the Index decreased 33
percent compared with the previous week. The Refinance Index decreased 4 percent from the previous
week and was 109 percent higher than the same week one year ago. The seasonally adjusted Purchase
Index increased 3 percent from one week earlier. The unadjusted Purchase Index decreased 32 percent
compared with the previous week and was 17 percent higher than the same week one year ago.

“Mortgage rates moved lower in line with Treasury yields, which declined on data showing a weaker labor
market and declining consumer confidence. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate declined to 6.32 percent
after steadily increasing over the past month,” said Joel Kan, MBA’s Vice President and Deputy Chief
Economist. “After adjusting for the impact of the Thanksgiving holiday, refinance activity decreased
across both conventional and government loans, as borrowers held out for lower rates. Purchase
applications were up slightly, but we continue to see mixed results each week as the broader economic
outlook remains cloudy, even as cooling home-price growth and increasing for-sale inventory bring some
buyers back into the market.”
...
The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances
($806,500 or less) decreased to 6.32 percent from 6.40 percent, with points decreasing to 0.58 from 0.60
(including the origination fee) for 80 percent loan-to-value ratio (LTV) loans.

The first graph shows the MBA mortgage purchase index.

According to the MBA, purchase activity is up 17% year-over-year unadjusted. Red is a four-week average (blue is weekly).  Purchase application activity is still depressed, but solidly above the lows of 2023 and above the lowest levels during the housing bust.  The second graph shows the refinance index since 1990.
The refinance index increased from the bottom as mortgage rates declined, but is down from the recent peak in September.

A set of alleged promotional renders for Motorola's suspected Edge 70 Ultra have surfaced, and it seems to want to sit on a premium throne.
Earlier today (Dec 2), a leak by Android Headlines seemingly showed off what Motorola is cooking up for its Edge 70 Ultra. The leaked rendering seems official, given the level of detail present in the imagery, though it's always worth waiting until Motorola's official say-so. Nevertheless, the post claims that the Edge 70 Ultra could retain a camera housing design similar to the Edge 70 series that launched early in November.
The company is seemingly sticking with that squared housing, as well as offering a triple camera setup with an LED flash present at the bottom right of the box.
There's one major difference to note in this leak: the Edge 70 Ultra could offer a soft, textured back. As the publication also notes, the renderings purport a material shift from the Edge 70, one that looks as if it were made from fabric. The renders show that the panel is textured, potentially improving how the device feels in the hand without a case. It'd be quite a change from the Moto Edge Plus (2023), which had a glass back that was extremely slippery in hand, and would likely cause the device to take a slippery spill.
The leaks don't divulge much more information; however, the device will retain its volume rocker and power button on its right side. Its display is an object of concern, as this leak doesn't show it. The Edge 70 launched with a completely flat display, which may feel more comfortable to hold than the Edge series' old curved screen. While it may feel likely that Motorola will keep the display flat, there's nothing certain yet.
 



Per the publication, the Edge 70 Ultra is rumored to retain a display size similar to the standard Edge 70, which is 6.6 inches; however, a small change might hit its chip. Recent rumors, after allegedly spotting the phone in a benchmark, suggest the Edge 70 Ultra could sport the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5. It's also been speculated that the phone will be paired with the Adreno 829 GPU and 16GB of RAM.
Regarding its chip, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 just launched last month, bringing flagship-level performance to budget phones. Qualcomm states its newest chip offers strong gaming capabilities, alongside AI and strong performance gains over its previous affordable device-oriented chip. The SoC utilizes the company's Oryon CPU cores, which speaks volumes to its reported performance gains this year.

Rumors aren't clear about when the market could see the Edge 70 Ultra, though there are theories that it could happen in early to mid-2026.

Applying for a home loan is a pain. You have to produce a heap of documents — bank statements, tax returns, employment records, tallies of investment accounts — to prove the stability of your financial footing, then wait for a mortgage underwriter to comb through all of it before giving you the thumbs up. I spoke with one exasperated homebuyer who described the process as a ""borderline invasion of privacy.""
While the average American submits to a financial colonoscopy en route to their dream home, wannabe real estate moguls have found a way to sidestep the hassle. With the help of a once-obscure type of loan, they've built mini-empires ranging from a few homes to a few hundred — without the usual scrutiny from lenders. These landlords include small-time investors eager to expand their portfolios, TikTok tycoons seeking new streams of real estate revenue, and seasoned property managers looking to make smart bets. In recent years, they've taken out billions of dollars' worth of ""debt-service coverage ratio"" loans — often abbreviated as DSCR — to hoover up homes. The loans enable income-seeking owners to quickly purchase rental properties while dodging annoying questions about their job history or outstanding debts. DSCRs may sound complicated, but obtaining one is relatively straightforward: A landlord just has to show their lender that the desired property will generate enough rent to cover the monthly payments and other basic expenses, such as taxes and insurance. The lender focuses on the property's cash flow, not the borrower's personal creditworthiness.
For some of these landlords, the cash isn't flowing as planned. Serious delinquencies on DSCR loans have nearly quadrupled in the past three years, data from the real estate analytics firm Cotality shows. Although the troubled loans account for only a small fraction of the total dollar amount of outstanding DSCR loans, they're a sign that debt-laden landlords face shakier economics amid a rental market slowdown. And while people in the industry defend the idea behind the loans — ""It's still a great product,"" one lending veteran tells me — they acknowledge the spread of some sketchy practices that contributed to the spike in bad debt, including ambitious rent targets, hasty approvals, and loans for properties where the rental income wouldn't even cover the basic monthly payments.
Despite all the hand-wringing over Wall Street-backed giants gobbling up homes, it's the small and midsize players — prime candidates for DSCR loans — that make up the lion's share of investor purchases. If lenders tighten their standards in response to the recent turbulence, that could mean fewer budding land barons angling for houses. Regular buyers might benefit from less competition for available homes or the forced sales of some of these places. But a little shakiness in the short term doesn't mean these loans, along with the investors seeking real estate riches, will disappear. Big asset managers, keen on putting their money to work in real estate, have embraced the product. And with more people turning to rentals instead of buying, more landlords will take on this debt to multiply their holdings — even if some of their dreams of building real estate kingdoms come crumbling down.
Most people are content to snag their small slice of the American dream, buying one or maybe a couple of properties that they can call home. But there's also a growing class of entrepreneurs chasing real-estate riches. Say you decide to become one of those landlords: You own a couple of rental homes that pull in good money, but you're itching to buy more. Odds are you'll need a loan — it's expensive, and probably unwise, to tie up all your cash in a property when you could use it to do all kinds of other things, like pay for repairs or maybe even purchase more places. The Blackstones and Pretiums of the world have ample access to debt, but it's trickier for a little guy like yourself. Even if your finances are golden, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae limit the number of so-called ""conventional loans"" you can get to buy up houses and turn them into rentals. Alternatively, you may encounter a limit with your debt-to-income ratio — you can only take on so many liabilities before the typical lenders put the brakes on any further borrowing. This is when you may turn to the world of DSCR loans, where a bevy of lenders promise quick closings, little inspection of your personal finances, and practically unlimited access to more money down the line, as long as you can find rental properties that promise to deliver cash.
True to their name, debt-service coverage ratio loans center on one key metric: the ratio of the property's expected rental income to its mortgage payment and basic monthly expenses, such as taxes, insurance, and association fees. Let's say the home you've set your sights on brings in $3000 in rent each month, while those expenses total $2,500. Divide that first number by the second, and you get a coverage ratio of 1.2 — well within the typical range for a DSCR loan. Lenders prefer the ratio to be above 1, so that the soon-to-be owner has a little cushion to cover unexpected expenses that are likely to arise, such as a broken water heater or repairs on an aging HVAC system.
DSCR loans for residential investors have been around for more than a decade, but they really came into vogue during the pandemic, when borrowing rates dropped and investors saw a chance to capitalize on rising home prices and juicy rent hikes. Landlord influencers took to social media to preach the gospel of BRRRR — an acronym for Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, Repeat — which they hailed as the golden path to financial freedom. Some of these evangelists leaned on DSCR loans to buy or refinance their properties, extracting equity from their homes and using the funds to scoop up more rentals. Larger firms also began purchasing loans from smaller private lenders, packaging them into portfolios worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and selling the resulting income streams as bonds, a process known as securitization. The embrace by so-called ""institutional investors,"" such as insurance companies and asset managers, who purchase these bonds, along with growing demand from small- to midsize landlords, enabled the industry to flourish. Data from SFR Analytics, a real estate analytics firm specializing in single-family rental homes, shows that DSCR lenders churned out more than $44 billion in loans in 2022, up from just $5.6 billion in 2019.
""It really went from an unknown asset class, or very small asset class, overlooked by much of the commercial world,"" says Hunter Latta, an executive at the DSCR lender Renovo Capital.
""Fast forward to today, it's a full-blown, widely accepted asset class.""
However, several things happened in 2022 that made it trickier for investors to wring cash out of their properties. The Federal Reserve began jacking up interest rates to fight inflation, making it more expensive to borrow money. Home prices had surged in the Covid era, so the properties landlords had invested in during the pandemic came with larger loan balances and heftier monthly payments. With Americans feeling financial pressure and fewer forming new households, the pace of rent growth also slowed. By March 2023, according to Cotality, single-family rents were up just 4.3% year over year, down from the 13.3% jump recorded a year prior. Some landlords found themselves in a bind: They'd taken on loans with higher rates, expecting rents to keep pace. But investing in real estate was no longer the slam dunk it had been just a year or two earlier.
The percentage of DSCR loans in ""serious delinquency"" — meaning that payments are at least 90 days late or the property is in foreclosure proceedings — has nearly quadrupled since mid-2022, Cotality data shows. Just under 2% of securitized DSCR loans (those packaged together and sold as bonds) fell into that bucket as of August, compared with around 0.5% at the same point in 2022. That may not sound like much, but quadrupling the amount of troubled debt has been enough for lenders to take notice. By contrast, only about 1% of conventional loans are seriously delinquent, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association.
Roby Robertson, an executive vice president at LoanLogics, a mortgage technology company, likens this period to a ""hangover in a really hot market."" The most challenged loans these days were originated in 2022 and 2023, right when the market was turning. Landlords who might have aimed for a conventional loan couldn't make the math work, so they turned to a DSCR to make their investment dreams come true. Some lenders offered quick closings and ""sub-unity loans,"" which meant that the debt coverage ratio on the home was less than 1 — the rent wouldn't be enough to cover the loan payments right out of the gate, so the landlord was either betting on the home's value increasing substantially in the future, or that rents would climb enough to cover the costs. On the other side of the deal, the lender might figure that the landlord had enough skin in the game to make it work: DSCR borrowers usually have to put down at least 20% of the home's value, and often significantly more, in order to get approval, which makes them unlikely to walk away from a property even if they're losing money on it.
Other landlords chose to refinance a traditional loan into a DSCR one, a double-edged sword: Though the new loans allowed them to capitalize on higher home prices and pull money out for more deals, they also wound up locked into higher borrowing rates, requiring higher rents to make the payments.
""There is a direct correlation between cash-out refinances and delinquency,"" says Alex Offutt, a DSCR executive and industry veteran, referring to landlords who took out loans right as borrowing rates jumped. ""You're taking out the cash to go buy more properties, but rents aren't keeping pace with property values, right? So you had people that essentially got themselves into an over-leveraged position where they were not able to collect the rent they thought they could.""
Some of these loans left other real estate lenders scratching their heads.
""We'll have a loan that we look at and say there's no way we'd finance that, no way we'd get to that leverage amount,"" says Sean Kelly-Rand, a managing partner at RD Advisors, an investment firm in Boston. ""And then all of a sudden we'll see them get a DSCR loan, and we're like, what?""
Despite the uptick in delinquencies, DSCR loans continue to boom. Landlords secured more than $38 billion in DSCR loans tied to over 100,000 properties last year, according to SFR Analytics. Through October of this year, lenders have cranked out another $32.8 billion on almost 89,000 rental homes. The country's two largest mortgage lenders, United Wholesale Mortgage and Rocket Mortgage, both now offer DSCR loans, with Rocket announcing its entrance to the space just last month.
Comparing recent delinquency rates to 2022 can be misleading, says Robertson, the LoanLogics executive. Low interest rates and rising home prices at the time made it relatively easy for almost anyone to make money in real estate. Additionally, delinquencies are now trending in the right direction, having decreased slightly from a peak of 2.2% early this year. With this perspective in mind, Robertson refers to the rise in bad debt as ""natural growing pains of an industry that's kind of hot right now.""
""With the market growing as fast as it's growing, I think it's actually pretty healthy,"" Robertson tells me.
Owners of single-family rental homes face a mixed bag, though. The rent-versus-buy math tilts firmly in their favor — an analysis by the research firm Zelman concluded that the calculation leans toward renting to a degree that hasn't been seen since the early 1980s. If people continue to choose renting over buying, that'll be a boon for landlords. On the other hand, rent growth is middling. Single-family rents in August were up just 1.4% year over year, according to Cotality — a 15-year low. And while some of these landlords may be sweating over stagnant or even falling rents, investors who fall behind on their DSCR loans aren't totally stuck: Because home prices have generally climbed over the past few years, delinquent borrowers are usually able to sell the house and pay off the loan, says Sujoy Saha, an analyst at S&P Global. Still, if fewer well-funded investors are chasing properties and more cash-strapped mini-moguls are dumping their distressed assets, that could mean better odds for regular first-time buyers, who often seek the kinds of entry-level properties that are typically turned into rentals.
For wannabe BRRRRers or members of the FIRE movement, skyrocketing home prices and rock-bottom borrowing rates made the rental business seem like the best way to make a buck just a few years ago. Landlords still see plenty of opportunities to come out ahead — but ultra-cheap loans are no longer part of the equation.
""People got hooked on the cheap money,"" Offutt tells me. ""Anybody can be successful when the money's cheap.""

When you’re looking for a good daily driver that can handle web browsing, productivity apps and streaming without breaking the bank, you don’t need to spend $2,000 on a MacBook Pro: This HP 15.6″ (256GB SSD, 16GB RAM, Intel Core chip) laptop is now on sale for $369 on Amazon, down from its usual price of $1,999. This seems to be an inventory clearance sale that has brought this model’s price down to its lowest point ever.

The Intel Processor N100 has four cores that run at a base frequency that can go up to 3.4GHz when tasks need more processing power. It also has 6MB of L3 cache to help frequently accessed data load quickly. This chip is part of Intel’s lineup of chips that are made for thin and light laptops, where battery life and heat management are more important than raw benchmark scores. This processor won’t let you work on 4K video projects or play demanding games, but it can handle the everyday computing tasks that most people do without slowing down.
With 16GB of DDR4 RAM, you can keep dozens of browser tabs open at the same time as Microsoft Office apps and video conferencing software without having to move data to the slower SSD and this much RAM is enough to make you stop worrying about closing programs to free up memory. The 256GB PCIe NVMe SSD loads Windows and apps faster than mechanical hard drives, but you’ll need to be careful about how you use the space because modern games and big media libraries can fill it up faster than you’d like.
The 15.6-inch Full HD screen shows content at a resolution of 1920×1080 and has an anti-glare coating that cuts down on reflections from windows and overhead lights. The 250-nit brightness rating is good enough for most indoor lighting, but you might have trouble reading the screen in direct sunlight or very bright places. Intel UHD integrated graphics can play videos and do basic photo editing and they have enough power for casual older games, but not enough for modern AAA games or heavy creative work.
Wi-Fi 6 connections are faster and work better in crowded networks than Wi-Fi 5 connections; Bluetooth 5.3 keeps wireless mice, keyboards, and headphones connected without dropping out. Two USB-A ports let you connect older peripherals without needing dongles, and the HDMI 1.4b output lets you connect to external monitors or projectors for presentations and more workspace.
Windows 11 Home comes with a desktop interface that most people are used to and works with a huge number of Windows programs that have been made over the years. You can use traditional desktop programs like Adobe apps, business software, and games from Steam on a Chromebook without the limitations that come with web-based workflows. The headphone/microphone combo jack works with standard 3.5mm audio devicesÂ and the built-in webcam is good enough for video calls for work and school from home.
At $369, this HP is at the same price as a Chromebook, but it has full Windows functionality and more RAM than you’d expect to find at this price point. Amazon is probably clearing out its remaining stock, which is why the price has dropped so much from the inflated $1,999.

Noticed Google recently making big moves in the AI space? OpenAI certainly has.
The world's most famous startup reportedly declared a ""code red"" in a companywide memo from CEO Sam Altman. What comes next could be a critical juncture in the AI wars that impacts us all.
Altman told employees to go heads down on improving ChatGPT, setting aside work on other products. It's a sign that the already intense battles over AI are only going to amplify.
On the one hand, that could spur even more innovation. Monopolies are never beneficial to consumers. Google's threat to OpenAI's place atop Mount AI could mean more competitive pricing, better tools, or simply a wider array of options for customers.
The fight over market share also comes with risks. For years, some AI experts have warned us about the danger the tech can pose when gone unchecked. OpenAI's mission statement is even ""to ensure artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.""
But what happens when your back is against the wall, competitors are breathing down your neck, and investors or analysts are asking tough questions? Will tech companies maintain a responsible approach to AI if they risk losing their competitive edge?
We're more than a decade removed from the infamous ""move fast and break things"" era that defined innovation in Silicon Valley for years. Tech companies previously vowed that aggressive style of innovation is a thing of the past.
But with trillions of dollars at stake, and everyone going hardcore, will that remain the case?
So what's got OpenAI so nervous?
BI's Brent D. Griffiths breaks down the key areas where Google can put pressure on the ChatGPT maker.
One issue is that OpenAI's smaller size is becoming more of a weakness than a strength.
Initially, Google's size made it a lot harder to keep up with the nimble OpenAI. But as AI enters its next era of growth, Google has the benefit of a massive ads business and wide-reaching distribution channels to fuel its AI plans.
The search giant has secured some big wins in recent weeks, most notably the launch of Gemini 3, which was widely praised.
(If you're curious about the differences between ChatGPT 5 and Gemini 3, BI's Katherine Li has you covered.)
And it's not just Google that OpenAI is nervous about. Let's not forget about fellow AI startup Anthropic, which also recently launched a new model, or Elon Musk's Grok.
OpenAI may have sparked the AI wars more than three years ago with the launch of ChatGPT, but it's still a long way from finishing them.

If AI feels overhyped now, Eric Schmidt suggests that businesses should brace themselves — the real disruption hasn't even begun yet.
In an interview with Professor Graham Allison at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum at Harvard University on Monday, the former Google CEO pushed back on the idea that AI's rapid growth is a speculative bubble, saying that the technology is actually under-hyped.
""If anything, it's under-hyped because you are fundamentally automating businesses,"" he said.
The real transformation, he said, is happening deep inside companies, where AI systems are beginning to take over the ""boring"" tasks that quietly consume billions in corporate spending.
The biggest gains, he suggested, will come from automating the backbone of corporate work: the repeatable, time-consuming processes buried deep inside every organization.
The former Google chief listed billing, accounting, product design, delivery, and inventory management as examples of this.
""There's an awful lot there — it's extraordinary,"" he said, pointing to areas like medicine, climate solutions, and engineering as sectors where automation could accelerate breakthroughs.
Schmidt, who helped steer Google's early investments in AI and later co-authored a book on AI with Henry Kissinger, implied the technology's economic impact will be far larger than markets or executives appreciate. 
Still, not everyone agrees with that perspective. Some economists are sounding alarm bells that the AI boom is overheated.
In an interview this week, renowned economist Ruchir Sharma said the AI surge displays all four traits of a classic bubble and could unravel if interest rates rise, while tech leaders such as Sam Altman and Bill Gates have cautioned that parts of the market resemble the dot-com era.
To illustrate how quickly AI capabilities are advancing, Schmidt described watching an AI system generate an entire software program.
""Holy crap. The end of me,"" he said.
""I've been doing programming for 55 years. To see something start and end in front of your own life is really profound,"" he added.
However, he said that AI's long-term upside extends far beyond coding.
From back-office workflows to logistics and scientific discovery, Schmidt believes the automation curve is still in its early stages of scaling and that Wall Street is underestimating the magnitude of the shift.
""The reason people are spending this amount of money,"" he said, ""is to automate the boring parts of their business.""

Futures are trading lower on Wednesday after an ADP report showing job losses, following a stellar day across Wall Street on Tuesday. All of the major indices finished the day higher, with the technology-heavy NASDAQ leading the way, closing up 0.59% at 23,413. The S&P 500 ended the session at 6,829, up 0.25% and the Dow Jones Industrials were last seen at 47,474, up 0.39%. Traders and investors are still experiencing weekly volatility whiplash, so it’s difficult to determine whether any given day marks the start or end of a trend, up or down. The one consistent tailwind for stocks is the prospect of another Fed funds rate cut next week, now priced in at an 80% probability, up from as low as 20% a month ago. Strength in technology stocks and a cryptocurrency rally helped to drive shares higher on Tuesday.
Yields were down across the curve as buyers returned, and the song remains the same:  The anticipation of a rate cut next week, combined with prospects for economic growth in 2026, seems to be the two factors that are driving yields on any given day. With the smart money leaning on President Trump’s economic advisor, Kevin Hassett, to be the next Federal Reserve Chairman, it’s a good bet that rates could be lowered even more in 2026. The 30-year-long bond closed at a 4.75% yield while the benchmark 10-year note finished the session at 4.09%

In a complete reversal from yesterday, prices were lower across the energy sector, with both major benchmarks and Natural gas closing lower.  The same combination of oversupply and changing prospects for ending the Russia-Ukraine war continues to tip the scales one way or another on any given day. Brent Crude closed Tuesday at $62.43, down 1.17%, while West Texas Intermediate was last seen $58.62, down 1.18%. Natural gas completed the trifecta on Tuesday, closing down 1.83% at $4.83. 

Like the back-up in the energy sector, gold suffered the same fate on Tuesday as the risk-off mood that lifted stocks contributed to the selling in the precious metals. Top sector analysts attributed the move lower to trading accounts taking advantage of the recent moves higher and taking profits. Gold finished the day at $4,226, while Silver was last seen at $57.59.
Cryptocurrencies rallied on Tuesday as recent dovish shifts in the Federal Reserve’s policy and the easing of liquidity pressures boosted risk assets like crypto, while advancements in decentralized applications and generally positive market sentiment also contributed to higher prices. The 30% drop in Bitcoin over the last couple of months was also a factor, as bargain-hunting investors were buyers. Bitcoin was trading at $91,494 at 5 PM EST, while Ethereum was quoted at $2,990.
24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders. Some of these daily analyst calls cover stocks to buy. Other calls cover stocks to sell or avoid. Remember that no single analyst call should ever be used as a basis to buy or sell a stock. 
Here are some of the top Wall Street analyst upgrades, downgrades, and initiations seen on Wednesday, December 3, 2025.

Amid the electric vehicle push at the start of the decade, automakers (and then countries) grew increasingly concerned about the long-anticipated surge of new cars and brands from China flooding into large markets like the United States and Europe. While seeds have been planted and China’s exports continue to worry countries, the threat of cheaper gas-engined cars could be more immediate.Â 
In a Reuters report on Tuesday, eight of the 10 largest-selling automakers in China were revealed to be part of the more than 6 million gas and gas-electric vehicles expected to be exported globally by the end of 2025, or about three-quarters of the countryâs automotive exports. Thatâs up from about a million five years ago.Â 
The change is led by a continued problem for Chinaâs automotive industry, for years now the largest in the world: Overcapacity.Â 
Chery Automobile Co. is the largest exporter, with the majority of its over 1 million exports through the end of October this year being gas-powered in one way or another. The second-biggest exporter in China, BYD, sent mostly battery electric vehicles to other countries so far this year. And Tesla, the eighth-largest automaker in the country, makes only EVs.
A principal reason for Chinaâs largest automakers focusing exports on vehicles without plugs is that the countryâs heavily-subsidized EV market remains buoyant for the home teams and less successful for the likes of Volkswagen Group, Mercedes-Benz, General Motors, and other US and European brands, especially at the higher end. Thatâs conversely left a surplus of capacity for other vehicles, though.
Now that the US and European Union are looking to shift away from original EV mandates by the middle of the next decade (something Chinese-owned Volvo Cars and Polestar are notably fighting against), Reuters says Chinaâs surplus of capacity to produce gas-powered vehicles has pressured its automakersâthe vast majority of which are government supportedâto keep factories moving and expand new markets. Analysts have also been increasingly vocal about the need for China to start consolidating some of its roughly three dozen brands in a saturated market with both large domestic and foreign brands.Â 
Chinaâs leading automakers have already set sights beyond Europe, with BYD building a presence in Brazil and other Latin American countries, according to a recent Politico report. Russia has also been an emerging market for Chinaâs cars, too.
However, it could be a double-edged sword for some of these companies. Competing automakers with better-established reputations, loyal customers, and long-standing sales and service support already have lots of popular and less-than-popular gas and hybrid vehicles and are willing to hold prices and pile on incentives in the short term to stop buyers jumping to new offerings.
And thereâs the issue that many Chinese-branded cars still sell mostly on price, with reviewers usually including that caveat. While the Tesla Model Y-rivaling XPeng G6, destined for Europe, was given a mostly positive review from InsideEVs, the UKâs Autocar said the similarly-sized Chery Tiggo 7 plug-in hybrid was satisfactory, âfor those who just need a car.â
None of this means youâre likely to see many cars from China in the US anytime soon, though, unless they come from Mexico, which Chinaâs automakers have long targeted. Years of revised tariff policies on Chinese goods (especially vehicles and battery packs), as well as concerns about China-developed software, have mostly made the American market off-limits to the passenger car industry and left companies like BYD to assemble buses in California. Components, while cheaper to produce in China, still face stiff tariffs.Â 
However, Americans have been able to buy cars assembled in China for years, but that number shrank this year. Volvo stopped importing the slow-selling S90 luxury sedan earlier this year after being imported from a plant in China since 2018, while it moved production of the EX30 EV SUV to Belgium with the introduction of the 2026 models, and declined to import a new ES90 electric luxury car, rather than using one of its factories in the US or Europe to build it for export. General Motors, however, continues to import the Buick Envision from its sole joint-venture plant with SAIC Motor, but the unchanged 2026 model landed in the US with a $3,000 price hike over the 2025 version.

After selling out months ago, Amazon has restocked its exclusive 4K Blu-ray edition of Fallout Season 1.
By 
    Steven Petite
   on December 3, 2025 at 10:29AM PST
 
 Fallout: Season 1 Limited Edition Steelbook (4K Blu-ray) 
 $44.20 
 
If you missed out on the Steelbook Edition of Fallout: Season 1 when it launched in July, you have another chance to snag a copy for your collection. Fallout: Season 1 Limited Edition Steelbook is back in stock for $44.20 on December 3. Exclusive to Amazon, this collectible 4K Blu-ray edition also comes with five art cards.
The Limited Edition Steelbook probably won't remain in stock for long. Amazon likely restocked it due to Season 2's imminent arrival on Prime Video. Season 2 premieres December 17 and switches the series to a traditional weekly schedule. Episodes will stream on Wednesdays, with the Season 2 finale slated for February 4.
Watch Fallout Season 1
The steelbook case features exclusive character art on the front and back, while the interior art includes an advertisement for Vault-Tec with Vault Boy reassuring you that everything will be just fine. You'll also get a slipcase and five art cards featuring the main characters.
The Limited Edition Steelbook has the same on-disc content and technical specs as the standard 4K Blu-ray edition, which you can read about below.
 
 
Fallout: Season 1 is a three-disc set featuring all eight episodes in 4K resolution (2160p) with HDR (Dolby Vision and HDR10). It also supports enhanced audio with Dolby Atmos and Dolby TrueHD 7.1 surround sound.
Season 1's eight episodes clock in at 450 minutes (7.5 hours). After you're done, you can pop in the special features disc and watch an assortment of behind-the-scenes featurettes. Like many other 4K releases of shows and movies, the bonus content is on a regular Blu-ray disc instead of 4K.
You can check out the full list of special features below:
Fallout: Season 1 Special Features:
 Fallout: Season 1 Limited Edition Steelbook (4K Blu-ray) 
 $44.20 
Season 1 released on Prime Video last April and earned positive reviews from critics and fans, making it one of the few live-action video game adaptations for TV that lived up to its namesake. It's fairly uncommon for Amazon to release its original shows on Blu-ray, so it's cool that Fallout is now available to watch without a subscription. The physical editions were manufactured and distributed by Warner Bros. Discovery Home Entertainment.
The show follows three characters as they trek across the Wasteland--a Vault dweller heading above ground for the first time, a squire of the Brotherhood of Steel, and a deadly bounty hunter known as The Ghoul.
We've rounded up some cool Fallout merch below, in case you want to add some collectibles to your display shelves.
The official Fallout Store on Amazon is loaded with products themed around the Prime Video show and Bethesda's game series. From backpacks and hoodies to records and figurines, there’s a little bit of everything, including a Vault Boy plush fashioned as a rubber duck, as shown above. You can also get Vault Boy, Vault Girl, Nuka-Cola, and more characters fashioned as vinyl rubber duck figures. 
Funko recently released new vinyl figures for the second season of Fallout:
If you like action figures and statues, check out this four-pack of six-inch Fallout figures. You could also grab the premium Fallout Maximus Figure by Dark Horse for $55 (was $70). Standing 10 inches tall, the hand-painted Brotherhood of Steel collectible is a great addition to any home theater or game room.
Fallout fans who like construction sets should check out the pair of Mega Bloks sets based on the Fallout 4 video game. Both sets released last year and were sold out for months before Amazon restocked them earlier this year. The Amazon-exclusive Mega Fallout T-60 Power Armor Set comes with five micro action figures and buildable rigs (327 pieces) for $32.39. The Mega Fallout: Red Rocket Truck Stop Set is a larger 824-piece playset with multiple figures and game-accurate details. You can pick up this set for $70 (was $86).
 
Fallout: New Vegas fans should also check out the upcoming 15th Anniversary Bundle, which is now available to preorder for $155 ahead of its launch next summer.

    The crazy-colorful shake is part of the McDonaldland Meal, which is like a (pricey) Happy Meal for adults. And now I know the flavor.
  
McDonald's Mt. McDonaldland shake is the most colorful product on the McDonald's menu.
I tried the McDonaldland Meal at my local McD's on Aug. 12, the day it came out. And I don't want to say that I've been thinking about the mystery flavor of its pink-and-blue Mt. McDonaldland shake ever since, because that would make me sound truly bizarre, but...I have pondered it. 
When I tasted the shake, I guessed it was maybe blue raspberry, maybe cotton candy, maybe mixed berry. It's sweet but not sickeningly so, though I'd never order it again. (I'm a chocolate fan.) 
But I kind of wanted to know what the mystery flavor was. And now I do: According to McDonald's Canada's own nutrition page for the shake, the blue beauty features a ""mix of creamy vanilla soft serve and raspberry flavored syrup."" (I tried to confirm this on the US nutrition page, but it just spun and spun and never loaded. Get on that, Ronald.)
RASPBERRY! The Mt. McDonaldland shake is raspberry flavor! And it's blue in color, so my guess of blue raspberry was correct! Raspberry is the hot fast-food flavor these days, as Starbucks just brought back its much-loved raspberry drink syrup in late July.
If you're wondering what I'm even talking about, McDonald's continues to capitalize on the love of its customers for the company's goofy history. Recently, Happy Meals included McDonald's-themed toys -- such as drink machines, fryers and trays with food on them -- delivered in mini-Happy Meal boxes. And the much-longed-for Snack Wraps finally returned after a viral fan campaign. 
The McDonaldland Meal goes straight after that market of adults who have a nostalgic feeling for the Golden Arches. It's not cheap -- here in high-cost-of-living Seattle, the medium meal was $16.59 and the large was $18.29.

You can choose from a Quarter Pounder with cheese or a 10-piece McNugget order. It also comes with the chain's famous french fries and your choice of drink. But the specialty drink that's made to go with the meal is called that mystery-until-now-flavored Mt. McDonaldland shake, and it's a blazing blue color, topped with hot pink whipped cream. It's supposed to look like a volcano, with the pink cream as lava, I guess.
Unlike the Happy Meal, the McDonaldland Meal is made for adults.
You can order the shake without the meal if you just want to try it. If you don't want to try it, you can choose a regular drink or another flavor of shake with your McDonaldland meal.

I sampled the hot pink whipped cream by itself, and it seemed to have no flavor, so maybe they just took regular whipped cream and dyed it pink.
Nostalgic characters from McDonald's advertising are displayed on the small tins included in the meals.
Instead of a simple toy, the McDonaldland Meal comes with a 5-by-7-inch tin with one of the McDonaldland mascot characters on it. I ended up with Hamburglar, who, after Grimace, would probably have been my choice. 
Tins come embossed with Hamburglar, Grimace, Ronald McDonald, Mayor McCheese, Birdie the Early Bird and the Fry Guys. Honestly, I'm not sure what anyone would do with this tin, but it was definitely a classier included item than most of the Happy Meal toys.
Inside the tin is a card with a code you can scan to explore McDonaldland online, an ID card for your particular character, two postcards and four stickers. One of my stickers said ""robble robble,"" the Hamburglar's favorite saying, and one read, ""Keep up! Hamburglar and I are mid-heist."" I can't really imagine anyone putting these on their water bottle or laptop, but to each their own.
Honestly, unless McDonald's nostalgia is your thing, I'd recommend you just stick to ordering your usual at the Golden Arches and skipping the meal. But if you just don't get enough blue and pink food in your life -- and who does? -- try the Mt. McDonaldland shake once, pass it around to let your friends make them guess the flavor before you smugly deliver the big reveal, and then go back to chocolate or another good old standard flavor."
63,2025-12-03,"As technology continues to advance and companies look to remain competitive in meeting market demand, the skills that employees will need are also evolving. A growing number of companies are exploring how to address these skills and workforce gaps with artificial intelligence.
HR can use AI to reveal ""patterns and gaps"" and benchmark ""current workforce skills against evolving business needs or industry trends,"" said Lauren Winans, CEO and principal human resources consultant at Next Level Benefits.
What AI offers in this realm isn't exactly new, said Will Howard, practice lead of HR trends and AI at McLean & Company. HR teams have long collected and analyzed workforce data manually, he said, but AI can make the process more ""feasible and efficient"" through automation.
Here, HR experts share four factors to consider when using AI to identify workforce and skills gaps:
Organizations have troves of HR data, such as job advertisements, performance reviews, and employee job histories and training, that can be mined to uncover skills gaps, said Sanmay Das, associate director of AI for Social Impact at Virginia Tech. But this data often lacks ""quality and completeness,"" Winans said.
Before adopting AI, organizations must embrace ""good data hygiene"" by ensuring the data they plan to analyze is accurate, current, and consistent, said George Denlinger, operational president of US technology talent solutions at Robert Half.
Otherwise, AI insights will be limited or inaccurate. ""The phrase 'garbage in, garbage out' rings especially true here,"" Howard said.
Companies need a clear and consistent process for collecting, maintaining, and updating workforce data, Howard said. For instance, standardize job descriptions, including specific skills, knowledge, and activities, so that AI can make accurate comparisons.
Large language models, like ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, can summarize and report on data, Das said. But, for a deeper analysis, companies often need specialized AI tools designed for HR, including workforce planning and analytics, Howard said. Workday and Disco are some examples.
Ultimately, AI tools can leverage your existing data and identify strengths and weaknesses in your workforce, Denlinger said.
For example, with data on employee performance for a specific project and sales forecasts, AI could suggest the skills or roles necessary to meet the organization's future demands, Howard said. Examining an employee's job and training history, AI could quantify their capacity to acquire new skills via upskilling or reskilling, Winans said.
IBM, for example, uses an AI system that analyzes its employees' digital footprints within the company to identify their skills and predict skill proficiency levels. The company then uses that analysis to offer employees personalized educational opportunities and career coaches, helping them identify job opportunities and new career paths. In 2024, IBM reported that the approach had boosted employee engagement by 20%.
While AI can analyze data, it may overlook nuances and the human aspects of what makes a role successful, such as small tasks not listed in a job description, soft skills, or the behind-the-scenes efforts employees put in, Das said.
Companies should also focus on data privacy, trust, and employee buy-in, Winans said. Employees may worry about how their data is being used and how it could impact them, such as changes to their roles or responsibilities. She suggested communicating transparently about what data will be used, how it will be used, and why.
Data literacy is another challenge: HR teams must know what to do with the AI results, Howard said. ""Even the most advanced AI technology still requires a human to put the results into a business context and communicate and take action on the insights within the organization.""
For instance, the AI analysis on skills gaps should inform decisions about new roles the company needs to create or the training necessary for existing employees, Winans said.
""Skill requirements evolve rapidly,"" Winans said. Using AI to uncover skills gaps should be a ""continuous process, not a one-time audit,"" she added.
While AI can be useful for tracking ongoing skills gaps, Denlinger said this is still an emerging use of the technology that will likely evolve.
Al also isn't a ""silver bullet that can take you from zero to best in class,"" Howard said. ""Organizations shouldn't view AI as a shortcut. It still requires the foundational skills and structures that have always been there,"" such as clean data and employees confident in using the technology.
Then, he said, AI ""becomes the cherry on top that can take your workforce planning and data analysis to the next level.""

Today, in the Real Estate Newsletter: Asking Rents Soft Year-over-year
Brief excerpt: Another monthly update on rents.

Tracking rents is important for understanding the dynamics of the housing market. Slower household formation and increased supply (more multi-family completions) has kept asking rents under pressure.

More recently, immigration policy has become a negative for rentals.

Apartment List: Asking Rent Growth -1.1% Year-over-year ...The national median rent fell 1.0% in November, and now stands at $1,367. This was the fourth consecutive month-over-month decline, as we’re now in the midst of the rental market’s off-season. It’s likely that we will close out the year with an additional modest rent decline in December.Realtor.com: 27th Consecutive Month with Year-over-year Decline in RentsOctober 2025 marks the 27th straight month of year-over-year rent decline for 0-2 bedroom properties since trend data began in 2020.

67,2025-12-03,"For decades, PC builders have used Crucial RAM sticks to power their PCs. However, as we've entered the AI era, said PC builders have been struggling to find specific components as interested parties begin hoovering up hardware to power their LLMs. At the start of the year, we saw a big GPU shortage to the point that     new GeForce RTX cards were selling for ridiculous prices.    
The graphics card market has cooled down since then, with RTX 50 cards now selling for more reasonable prices. However, the ever-hungry AI market has set its gaze on another component: RAM. Prices have spiked worldwide as companies buy up sticks on a massive scale, and it has gotten so bad that Micron is removing the Crucial brand from its consumer-facing products to supply businesses instead.
Budget CPUs still exist, but only in name
 As reported by Reuters, Micron has announced that Crucial will no longer be sold to consumers. It'll continue to ship out products to people until February 2026, after which it'll become a business-only channel.
Sumit Sadana, chief business officer at Micron, said the following:
""The AI-driven growth in the data center has led to a surge in demand for memory and storage. Micron has made the difficult decision to exit the Crucial consumer business in order to improve supply and support for our larger, strategic customers in faster-growing segments.""
The loss of Crucial is a huge blow to the consumer market. As per the company's own timeline, the company was one of the first to offer DDR RAM to consumers back in 2000, with the intent of making it easier for people to upgrade their PCs at home. Now that Crucial has withdrawn from the market 25 years later, it shows just how the market has changed to support the AI industry.
This isn't the first time we've seen the RAM shortage affect how a business operates. Just a couple of days ago, we saw Raspberry Pi raise the prices of the Pi 4 and Pi 5 SBCs in response to RAM becoming harder to purchase. While older models of the SBC were left unaffected, newer models got some nasty price spikes related to the amount of RAM they have, with the 16 GB models getting up to a $25 increase. And while everyone is keen to point the finger at the AI industry as the number one cause, some people believe that things don't quite add up.

Two of the nation's latest food recalls concern cheese — and lots of it.
The recalls are distinct, citing different food safety concerns: One involves hundreds of thousands of containers of shredded mozzarella and multi-cheese blends, while the other affects several brands of grated Pecorino Romano.
But both recalls target products that have sell-by dates in 2026 and are sold in major retailers in more than a dozen states.
Here's what to know:
Great Lakes Cheese, an Ohio-based company that calls itself ""the nation's leading natural cheese packager,"" initiated a recall of half a dozen kinds of shredded cheese products — from mozzarella to pizza style — in early October because they may contain fragments of metal.
This week, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) upgraded the recall's risk classification to Class II, the second highest, meaning consumption of the product could cause ""temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences.""
The affected cheeses are sold under dozens of brand names at nationwide retailers including Target, Walmart, Publix and Aldi.
The FDA says they were distributed to 31 states — Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin — as well as Puerto Rico.
The recalled bags, with varying sell-by dates in February and March 2026, include:
The full list of products is on the FDA's website. The FDA has not published a press release or responded to NPR's request for comment about the recall. NPR reached out to Great Lakes Cheese but did not hear back by publication time.

The Ambriola Company, a New Jersey-based cheese distributor, announced last week that it was recalling some of its products after routine testing confirmed the presence of listeria, which can cause potentially life-threatening infections.
It said that while no illnesses had been reported, it was recalling products processed at that same facility ""out of an abundance of caution."" Those products were distributed to retail stores — as well as other distributors — between Nov. 3 and 20, the FDA says.
""We take food safety very seriously and immediately alerted stores and distributors to remove the affected products from shelves,"" Ambriola CEO Phil Marfuggi said in a statement. ""We are working closely with the FDA and continuing to test our products and facilities to fully understand the situation.""
The recalled products are sold — both in plastic containers and in pound-size plastic bags — under the brand names Ambriola, Locatelli, Pinna, Boar's Head and Member's Mark.
They have expiration dates ranging from February to May 2026. It's not clear exactly where the cheeses ended up, though Walmart says some are sold at Walmart locations in 14 states and Sam's Club locations in 27 states.
Wegmans has also issued a recall of Locatelli-brand Pecorino Romano — over the same listeria concerns — that it says was sold in stores in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington, D.C., between Nov. 14 and 24.
The FDA urges customers to toss the cheese or return it for a refund, and to contact their doctor if they develop symptoms of a listeria infection, which usually start within two weeks of eating contaminated food and can include fever, headache, stiff neck and muscle aches.
In the meantime, Ambriola says it has suspended production and distribution of affected products as it conducts a ""thorough review of all sanitation and food safety procedures.""

70,2025-12-03,"THE RUPEE continued its fall on Wednesday, breaching the 90-mark against the US dollar for the first time, weighed down by persistent equity selling by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs), uncertainty around the India-US trade deal and higher importer demand for the American currency.
The rupee ended at an all-time low of 90.19 against the dollar, after opening at 89.96, against the previous close of 89.97. The currency hit a record low of 90.30 during intraday trading. In New Delhi, Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran downplayed the fall, saying: “I am not losing sleep over it.”
“It (rupee) will come back next year. Right now, it is not impacting inflation or exports,” he told reporters on the sidelines of the Confederation of Indian Industry’s India Edge summit.
So far in the current calendar year (January 1 to December 3, 2025), the currency has fallen  by around 5.35 per cent compared to 2.88 per cent depreciation in 2024 and 0.57 per cent in 2023. It weakened sharply by 11.3 per cent in 2022, after a 1.74 per cent decline in 2021.
Wednesday’s fall in the currency was fuelled by the growing uncertainty around the Indo–US trade deal, which has supported the US dollar and created caution in emerging market (EM) currencies, including the rupee, said Anindya Banerjee, Head Commodity and Currency, Kotak Securities.
The rupee came under pressure after a wave of stop-losses was triggered above the 90 level, especially from leveraged traders and option sellers who were defending that zone.
Steady importer demand, particularly from sectors like oil, metals, and electronics, which continues to absorb available dollar liquidity, further weighed on the currency, Banerjee said.
Persistent selling by overseas investors in the domestic equity market also contributed to the rupee depreciation. FPIs have sold Rs 1.52 lakh crore of shares so far in calendar year 2025. In the first three days of December, they have offloaded Rs 8,369 crore equities.
Forex market participants said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) was active in the market to moderate the fall in the rupee, though its intervention was limited. “The RBI has consistently stated its focus is on managing rupee volatility. It intervened in the market today but did not defend any specific exchange rate level,” said an analyst.
The rupee’s slide beyond the 90 mark has increased hedging costs, with forward premiums jumping as both corporates and leveraged traders rushed to secure protection against further weakness. The one-year USD/INR forward premium rose another 7 basis points (bps) on Tuesday — over 12 bps in just three sessions. The one-month tenor spiked to a seven-month high near 19.5 paise.
“The move reflects a mix of genuine hedging demand and expanding speculative positions, underpinned by the growing perception that the RBI may allow a deeper adjustment after the currency broke below the previously defended 88.80 level,” said Dipti Chitale CEO Mecklai Financial Services Pvt Ltd.
The depreciation has also widened the India–US 10-year yield spread to nearly 250 bps, the largest in almost a year. Investors are demanding a higher cushion for currency risk as foreign appetite softens amid tariff uncertainty and a heavy domestic bond-supply calendar, she said.
According to Bank of Baroda’s Chief Economist, Madan Sabnavis, a depreciating rupee will help exporters at the margin but is not good for importers or inflation.
Nilesh Shah, Managing Director, Kotak Mahindra AMC, said: “It is very difficult to figure out whether the rupee will bottom out at 91 or 92 or 93, but we think a depreciation of 2-3 per cent of the rupee is needed to maintain our export competitiveness. The REER (Real Effective Exchange Rate) model also suggests 2-3 per cent depreciation every year.”
With the RBI policy due on December 3, markets will look for cues on whether the fall will stabilise. Technically, the rupee remains oversold and needs to reclaim 89.80 to recover meaningfully, said Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst – Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities.

71,2025-12-03,"A new study suggests the Big Four's supposedly meritocratic promotion systems may rely far less on performance than on internal politics — and, crucially, on whether your manager is willing to put their own reputation on the line for you.
Within the Big Four professional services firms — Deloitte, PwC, KPMG, and EY— auditors are evaluated throughout the year after each client assignment.
Supervisors generally award A-to-D grades on technical competence, teamwork, leadership, and client relationships, creating a paper trail that appears — at least formally — to determine who gets promoted in the firms' ""up-or-out"" system.
In theory, auditors who consistently exceed expectations should advance more quickly, while weaker performers may stay at the same level or even be asked to leave the firm.
However, researchers from KEDGE Business School, ISG, and the University of Cambridge gained rare access to two promotion committees inside a Big Four audit firm's Paris office, observing 6.5 hours of deliberations and conducting 61 interviews with 49 auditors and managers between 2015 and 2021. The researchers did not say which Big Four firm they observed during their study.
What they found upends the idea that high performers naturally rise to the top.
According to the paper, promotion committees function far less as objective reviews of auditors' work and far more as ""political arenas"" where managers lobby, trade favors, and defend their protégés.
Instead of simply aggregating the year's performance evaluations, committees frequently reassess — and even overturn — those scores after heated debate.
In some cases, auditors with solid ratings were downgraded because supervisors admitted their earlier evaluations had been ""complacent.""
In other cases, strong performers were promoted above higher-scoring peers because influential managers went to bat for them — or because rivals stayed silent.
Thomas Roulet, one of the study's authors and a professor of organizational sociology and leadership at the University of Cambridge, said one of the deeper paradoxes is that ""audit firms believe they are particularly fair, square, and transparent, while the collective nature of the work and the collective nature of the evaluation make it opaque and political by nature.""
EY, Deloitte, and PwC did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.
KPMG pointed to its 2024 Transparency Report, which stated that the firm's compensation and promotion policies are informed by market data and ""are clear, simple, fair, and linked to the performance and talent review process.""
The study also found that auditors are not the only ones being evaluated.
Managers' judgment is also under scrutiny, creating a powerful incentive to play it safe in performance reviews and align with what they believe the committee wants.
One senior manager told researchers he fought hard for an employee not just to keep her, but because he didn't want colleagues saying he ""overestimates his protégés.""
The result, the authors said, is a system where second-order evaluations — evaluations of evaluations — outweigh actual performance.
That dynamic ""raises questions about whether promotion committees are fit for purpose,"" they wrote, and helps explain why many auditors feel the process is opaque, political, and fundamentally unfair.
Roulet added that when managers lack influence — or choose not to expend political capital — high performers suffer.
""Those auditors who don't get support,"" he said, ""get stuck at the same level or, in general, get less recognition than what they deserve. This fosters a strong sense of injustice and unfairness.""
While he said Big Four firms ""do recognize merit and hard work,"" he said, ""the ranking system can disadvantage even high performers when everybody is a high performer.""
Internal politics has always been a feature of rising up the ranks within the Big Four, as it is in most corporate jobs.
The firms operate as limited liability partnerships (LLPs), a structure in which partners typically get a vote in strategic matters and a share of annual profits if they hold equity in the business. Making it to the top requires strong people skills, both in building an internal network and winning potential new clients.
You can be technically good, but unless you invest time building those internal networks, you won't progress as quickly, James O'Dowd, founder of the global executive recruiter Patrick Morgan, which specializes in senior partner hiring and industry analysis, previously told Business Insider.
Promotions at all levels of the Big Four have also become tougher to secure as firms struggle to manage sluggish revenue growth and AI disruption to their traditional work.
In May, the UK branch of Deloitte told employees in an internal memo that it would only promote 25% of the workforce. The previous year, the firm promoted 28% of its employees. The same memo said that Deloitte had ""faced a particularly challenging year and fell materially short of its performance goals.""

""I actually think it's a brilliant idea if it can be done in an educational way that's legal.""
By 
    Eddie Makuch
   on December 3, 2025 at 10:10AM PST
Prediction markets have been popular for years, and now Roblox's top boss has said he wants to see them integrated into the hugely popular game someday.
CEO Dave Baszucki told The New York Times, ""We would. I think we would have to do that.""
It's not so easy, though, as Baszucki said every country has different legislation surrounding ""loot boxes and kid gambling,"" so there are regulatory hurdles that would need be sorted out.
Baszucki is bullish on the idea, even if it might take time to come to fruition. For what it's worth, the interviewer and host laughed at the idea of prediction markets in Roblox.
""I actually think it's a brilliant idea if it can be done in an educational way that's legal. And so, imagine no free Robux, no free prizes, just a game called the Dress to Impress Predictor, where it's not like trying to get kids' money or anything like that. I would be a big fan of it,"" he explained.
Prediction market platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi are peer-to-peer platforms where people can buy and sell contracts tied to any number of events, including professional sports and culture events like which movie will win Best Picture. They are different from traditional sports betting platforms because there is no ""house"" setting the odds.
Prediction markets in the US are regulated by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, an agency of the US government that recently granted approval to Polymarket to function in the US. Its main rival, Kalshi, was approved by the CFTC years ago.
Kalshi recently reached a deal with CNN to feature its markets in the CNN newsroom, a decision that drew much debate and discussion online. Prediction markets, like traditional sports gambling, have been a hot-button issue, with many saying it's bad and dangerous for many different reasons.
Currently, Kalshi has a number of open markets for gaming, including a market for Game of the Year at The Game Awards. More than $2.3 million has been exchanged so far on this market, with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 far and away the leading choice to win.
Baszucki made headlines recently when he was asked in this same interview about child predator concerns in Roblox. His response was not what many people wanted to hear.

For the past three years, we have lived in the “generative era,” where AI could read the internet and summarize it for us. 2026 marks the beginning of the “agentic era,” where AI stops just consuming the web and starts writing to it – a shift from information retrieval to task execution.
This isn’t just a feature update; it is a fundamental restructuring of the digital economy. The web is bifurcating into two distinct layers:
A big question mark is advertising, where Google’s expansion of ads into AI Mode and ChatGPT showing ads to free users could alleviate pressure on CPCs, but AI Overviews (AIOs) could drive them up. 2026 could be a year of wild price swings where smart teams (your “holistic pods”) move budget daily between Google (high cost/high intent) and ChatGPT (low cost/discovery) to exploit the spread.
It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent; it is the one most adaptable to change.

Prediction: Nvidia stock will correct by >20% in 2026 as its largest customers successfully shift 15-20% of their workloads to custom internal silicon.

				Overhype			

Last election season you might recall that the Trump administration lied repeatedly and pretended to be really interested in reining in corporate power and shoring up antitrust reform. And while this line was propped up by a lot of useful idiots (like Matt Stoller) who insisted there was common cause to be made with fascists, the whole thing was bullshit, designed to cover up widespread corruption and generational damage to regulatory independence and U.S. corporate oversight. 
Despite having followed up on none of their antitrust reform promises, Trumpland is back again pretending it’s an important policy arena for them. This time by leveraging a fake interest in antitrust reform to start seeding the idea that Netflix shouldn’t be allowed to buy Warner Brothers. Who, coincidentally, is fielding a rival bid from Trump’s billionaire right wing friend, Larry Ellison.
“Somebody” leaked word to Republican ally Charles Gasparino at the New York Post, who dutifully presents the idea that the Trump administration actually cares about corporate consolidation as if it’s a serious thing:
“Senior White House officials recently discussed antitrust concerns surrounding Netflix’s interest in acquiring the Warner Bros. studio and the HBO Max streaming service – raising doubts whether such a deal would give Netflix too much power over Hollywood, The Post has learned.
The high-level meeting that took place about 10 days ago hasn’t been previously reported. Several White House officials also suggested during the sitdown that a broader investigation is necessary focusing on Netflix’s market power, a government official who attended the confab said.”
It’s not clear if the administration, Comcast, or Paramount insiders leaked word to Chuck, but it should be reiterated that the Trump administration obviously does not actually care about unchecked “market power.” With one hand, this administration has taken a hatchet to all meaningful regulatory oversight of corporate power, setting back labor rights, consumer protection, and public safety generationally, while with its other hand, it is dismantling what remains of U.S. media consolidation limits.
Most media coverage of these rival bids won’t have the backbone to make it clear that while Netflix ownership of Warner Brothers would most certainly probably be bad for the market, the Trump administration doesn’t actually care about that. It cares about helping billionaire allies and punishing “woke” companies that platform too many minorities and gay people for their liking. 
Netflix ownership of HBO likely wouldn’t be good for the brand, but it’s not like Warner Brothers Discovery or AT&T were good for the brand (or market health) either. David Zaslav has been notorious for mismanaging the home of CNN and HBO. And Netflix, as the New York Times noted last September, is possibly the least overtly compromised of the three companies when it comes to kissing MAGA ass (which isn’t saying much, and certainly isn’t guaranteed to last).
In this case, the options here are all bad. The other bidders for Warner Brothers, HBO, and CNN include Comcast (NBC Universal) and Larry Ellison (CBS). Neither would be good stewards of the HBO brand, clearly don’t give much of a shit about healthy market competition, and have shown they’re more than willing to throw any remaining principles in the trash to curry favor with the administration.
The best and correct play for a government that actually cared about antitrust reform, consumer protection, and healthy markets would be no additional consolidation at all. But good faith media reform is not, and has never been, what the Trump administration is after.

When Stranger Things 5 dropped last week, there was plenty to geek out about. The big Will reveal at the end of episode four. Seeing what Max is up to. Dustin being a general badass. And while all that was great, I personally geeked out for something else. The return of a 1980s snack that most, except me and the Duffer Brothers, had seemingly forgotten. A snack that, thanks to Stranger Things, is now back for a limited time.
I’m talking about Peanut Butter Boppers, the snack that Murray brings Steve in the first episode of the season, which then comes back later as well. Boppers, which are basically rice cereal and fudge wrapped around peanut butter, were introduced in 1985 and, according to a General Mills article, accounted for 9% of the entire snack market in the first three months of release. So, they were pretty popular for a while before being discontinued in 1989.
Now though, thanks to the inclusion in Stranger Things, Nature Valley is re-releasing the snacks to fans. You can get a box for the cheeky (but very overpriced) sum of $19.87 at sreppob.com, which is “Boppers” spelled backwards. The company is also going to be giving away boxes and revealing a new recipe on the site, so head there for more. Netflix’s official site also has some additional info.
Obviously, I ordered a box immediately because, as a child of the 1980s, I loved Peanut Butter Boppers. My mom bought them for me all the time. When they appeared in The Lost Boys, as part of Grandpa’s special shelf in the fridge, I felt like we were kindred spirits. And while I don’t remember exactly when they went away, I do remember being very disappointed about it. But now, over 30 years later, thanks to the Duffer Brothers, I can enjoy these peanut butter snacks again. And you can too.

          The Duffer Brothers' hit series returns and is now streaming on Netflix.
        

          'Stranger Things 5' is out this week on Netflix, so your window to prepare is dwindling.
        

          Speaking at a recent 'Star Trek' convention, the star argued that the franchise's most fundamental rule is made to be broken.
        

          Cara Buono has played Karen Wheeler across all five seasons of the Netflix hit, and the stakes for her character have never been higher.
        

          The final outing for the Duffer Brothers' hit Netflix series might just be getting started in the charts.

80,2025-12-03,"“My prognosis is five years, which, when you’re 31, fit and healthy and newly married, isn’t what you expect to hear,” said Tom Chapman
Brain Tumour Research8
 Two weeks after celebrating his honeymoon, a “fit and healthy” man was told he had just five years due to an aggressive brain tumor.

 On March 16, Tom and Vicky Chapman — professional rugby players from London, England — were fresh off their honeymoon in Sri Lanka when Tom, 31, suffered a seizure in their home.

 “What was meant to be the start of married life with Vicky, who I’d already been with for over a decade, soon turned into something out of a nightmare,” Tom, 31, told the British charity, Brain Tumour Research.

 “All I remember is waking up on the floor, dazed and confused with paramedics around me,” he recalled. “Vicky told me what happened. We were both napping on the sofa and our dog started barking which woke Vicky. Five seconds later my body went into seizure which lasted around seven minutes, and I stopped breathing. Vicky had to perform CPR, which must’ve been terrifying for her.”

 When an ambulance arrived, paramedics took Tom to University Hospital Lewisham in London where CT scans revealed that he had a brain tumor “the length and size of a toilet roll tube.” 

 Doctors initially believed Tom had a grade 2 glioma and scheduled him for surgery.

 “The consultant told me I’d probably had it since I was a child and gradually it had mutated. In some ways it was reassuring because I’d gone 31 years without any side effects,” he explained.

 However, after surgery to remove the tumor on April 15, pathology results confirmed that Tom had grade 4 astrocytoma — a fast-growing and aggressive brain tumor.

 “To me, all I heard and had heard so far was numbers. I knew hearing four was worse than two,” he said. “During the appointment I asked what could have caused the tumour to develop, and what could happen in different treatment scenarios, but I was met with what seemed like stock answers from the medical team. It was frustrating that the doctors didn’t have the answers, but I’ve come to understand that’s because they don’t have the knowledge because there’s been a lack of spending in research into brain tumours. It all has a knock-on effect.”

 “My prognosis is five years, which, when you’re 31, fit and healthy and newly married, isn’t what you expect to hear,” he admitted.

 After surgery, Tom went through chemotherapy and radiation at the Royal Marsden Hospital in Chelsea. He’s also participating in a clinical trial to prolong his life. 

 “I want to do everything I can to beat this disease and live as close to a normal life as possible,” he said.

 Tom told the charity that, in the meantime, he and Vicky are sharing his journey in hopes of raising awareness and funds for additional research about brain tumors and treatment plans. 

 “The problem is brain tumour patients often don’t have the luxury of time, which is why investment in research needs to happen now,” he explained. “At the moment, it feels like a one-size-fits-all approach, but patients aren’t all starting from the same point. I refuse to be defined by an average.”

 Vicky told the Daily Mail that the couple was excited to start a family after their honeymoon, but they’ve obviously “been thrown a bit of a curveball” with Tom’s diagnosis. She’s set to begin IVF in January in hopes of making that dream come true.

 She said she’s confident that her husband will be there for their future children, longer than doctors expect.

 “If everything works out, he gets to be a father and experience that. And if it doesn't work out, then I have a little something of him that's left behind,” she continued. “People who have the view of, ‘But you might not make it,’ [I say] no one's promised tomorrow.”

81,2025-12-03,"Yes, Ford once had a hemi engine of its own. So why have you never heard about it? Because the hemi-headed V8 known as the legendary 427 SOHC ""Cammer"" engine never actually made it under the hood of a vehicle in production. This is largely due to the fact that the engine it was originally built to beat was outlawed before Ford ever had a chance to use it.
Designed in less than three months in an attempt to counter Chrysler's 426 Hemi ahead of the 1964 NASCAR season, Ford's single-overhead-cam 427 really showed a lot of promise. Engineers had created a two-valve, SOHC conversion of the 427 FE side-oiler, complete with a 6-foot roller timing chain, cross-bolted mains, revised oiling, and hemispherical combustion chambers. In its factory trim, the Cammer produced roughly 616 horsepower at 7,000 RPM, which was far more than any showroom Ford could ever realistically contain at the time.
Meanwhile, NASCAR leadership took notice. To them, the escalating engine war was turning standard stock cars into something so powerful they needed to crack down on it. So, NASCAR banned ""special racing engines"" like the 426 Hemi, nicknamed, ""The Elephant"" and the 427 SOHC Cammer. However, this wasn't the official end of Ford's racetrack-ready hemi engine.
Even after the ban, Ford tried lobbying for approval. Unfortunately for them, it didn't work: NASCAR reinstated the ban in December 1965. The following year, NASCAR did permit the Cammer to race but with such severe restrictions that the project simply became unworkable for competition. With a single carburetor limit, Galaxie-only usage, and a 430-pound weight penalty, there was just no way Ford was going to make the Cammer a reality in a production car.
With its dreams of a NASCAR future now crushed, the Cammer immediately became an engine without a home. What's worse, Ford had already invested in a new hemispherical powerplant, which meant parts were stacked and ready. Rather than abandon the program entirely, the company redirected its V8 to take drag racing by storm instead.
Obviously, drag racing is an entirely different beast. As such, Ford had little engineering support to offer beyond parts distribution. This left racers to refine, modify, and, in many cases, rescue the engine in real time. Using Ford's hemi for drag racing also revealed some major weaknesses — especially in the block.
According to famed engine builder Ed Pink (via Hot Rod), the bottom end of Ford's hemi was only made to handle around 750 horsepower. However, when used for drag racing, nitro teams were extracting more than 2,500 horsepower, which meant they were blowing the engine blocks apart in just a handful of runs. Timing-chains and the oiling system repeatedly failed under quarter-mile loads as well.
It might have been just the thing to win at Daytona, but in the National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) pits, there was no denying the Cammer was way out of its element. That's not to say that it didn't bring home any wins for Ford, though. Drag racer Connie Kalitta was among the first to receive a Cammer, and he became the first driver to surpass 200 mph at an AHRA national event in 1965. Drivers including Bill Lawton, Gas Ronda, and Phil Bonner also scored significant wins.
While Kalitta and others continued to use the Ford engine, most teams would go on to transitioned to Chrysler power. By the early 1970s, the Cammer's competitive window had officially closed. From there, the 427 SOHC never entered mass production because it was never engineered for consumer use, nor was it ever intended for the emissions or durability standards that came with such use. As soon as Ford shifted its performance strategy away from the Cammer, its hemi was pretty much laid to rest."

Traveling with large dogs is a nightmare. Airline restrictions force heavier dogs into the often unsafe cargo hold, and only the uberrich can afford to ferry their furbabies on a private jet.
Frustrated by how hard it was to fly with his own Labradors, Maple and Willow — and often having to leave them behind — entrepreneur Benton Miller founded RetrievAir, a pet airline that lets oversized dogs (or any-sized dog or cat) ride in the cabin alongside their owners.
In an interview with Business Insider, Miller said the pet-air-travel sector represents a $5.5 billion US market with plenty of room for more players. RetrievAir fares average $775 per seat.
Miller recently turned to ABC's ""Shark Tank"" reality show for funding and secured $776,000 from guest Shark and Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian in exchange for a 15% stake — a nod to Ohanian's ""Seven Seven Six"" venture fund. Ohanian has a 100-pound dog named Adora.
Miller said Ohanian ""understands burn"" because of his tech background and ""knows how to scale to a billion-dollar company."" RetrievAir, which launched in May, secured over $500,000 in sales within weeks of opening bookings.
Some veteran Sharks, including Kevin O'Leary, aka Mr. Wonderful, were skeptical of RetrievAir's $80,000-a-week operating costs. But Miller said sales have since picked up, more cities have been added, and some routes — like New York to Florida — are even selling out.
RetrievAir is not your typical flight experience: Customers book flights online, but instead of navigating a crowded terminal, flyers and their pets meet at a small private airport about 45 minutes before takeoff. Security is faster and tailored to animals.
The pets don't have to be caged and stuffed under the seat in front of you, and Miller said the chartered 30-seater Embraer E135 jet was modified from a 50-seater — giving each seat ample room for humans and animals to spread out.
Dogs over 40 pounds must sit in a paid, assigned seat next to their owner. Lighter pets can sit on their owner's lap or at their feet, and each seat has a leash to secure the animal.
And there's a flight attendant — trained in basic pet behavior — to keep everyone safe, watered, and full of treats.
Miller said the white noise from the engines relaxes most dogs, and they commonly sleep during the flight. They recommend owners of more anxious dogs bring a familiar toy or blanket to help comfort them.
Dogs must have their Rabies vaccine to fly. Luggage, snacks, and alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages are included for human passengers.
The plane makes a pit stop on the ground every two hours so the animals can use the bathroom (Miller said pet accidents are rare) and the jet can be cleaned. A flight from New York to Denver, for example, would stop in Chicago.
It's less convenient than a nonstop, but it serves two purposes: It protects the health and comfort of the animals, and it allows RetrievAir to sell the trip as one long, single itinerary or split it into individual legs to capture more potential customers.
Pet-focused public charter carriers aren't new. Companies like BarkAir and K9 Jets already schedule shared flights for humans and their pets. Miller said Ohanian's involvement — paired with RetrievAir's efficiency-focused model — has helped put the company on a stronger footing.
""We've had profitable days, profitable weeks,"" he said. However, he added that their load factor, or the percentage of seats sold, still does not consistently reach the 50% level needed across all routes to reliably generate revenue.
Still, he said he's focused on keeping the service accessible to everyday pet owners by offering lower fares and opening new routes, while maintaining the semi-private jet experience that makes the model work.
Miller said the average fare is around $775 one-way per seat.
Some shorter upcoming trips, like New York to Washington, DC, in February 2026, are priced as low as $300. He said the lower DC price is possible because the plane flies into a smaller, less expensive airport about 30 miles from the city.
This could be a pain for travelers, but Miller said the location saves money. He added that he prefers these out-of-the-way airports because they're also less congested and cover broader areas.
""Waukegan National Airport in Illinois is 45 minutes north of Chicago, but it's also 45 minutes from Milwaukee,"" Miller said, adding that smaller airports also reduce the risk of air-traffic delays.
Some RetrievAir trips are more expensive, such as the New York to Los Angeles route, which costs a little over $3,000 one-way per seat in February, or around $6,000 if the dog is over 40 pounds and requires its own seat.
That compares with the roughly $6,700 one-way ticket on BarkAir or K9 Jets on the same route for one seat. The two competitors charter Bombardier and Gulfstream jets that are half the capacity or smaller than the Embraer jet that RetrievAir uses.
RetrievAir flies to six US destinations and plans to add six more in 2026. Unlike both BarkAir and K9Jets, RetrievAir does not fly internationally, but plans to do so in the future. Miller said Seattle is among its highest-requested destinations.
""There are more pets than kids in the city,"" he said. ""Seattle attracts Canadians, especially in the Vancouver area, who may have a vacation home in Arizona or California and need our service.""
RetrievAir's Embraer jet is operated by the third-party carrier RVR Aviation. Miller's team handles scheduling and bookings, while RVR manages the aircraft, maintenance, and crew.
The plane has three seats per row: a single seat on one side of the aisle (seat A) and two seats on the other (seats B and C). Miller said dogs up to 40 pounds can share their owner's seat space and are placed in the A seats by the window.
Bigger dogs, however, need their own seat and are placed in B and C with their owner — with the pup riding in the window seat and away from where they could more easily sniff their neighbor.
Miller said there are precautions to ensure that aggressive or reactive dogs are kept away from other pets, like boarding back to front to minimize interactions. Pets and their owners are denied boarding if the crew anticipates an issue.
""There's a bit of an honor system when booking, that's when we ask for the temperament of the pup,"" Miller said. ""We will talk with the owner if the pet is not friendly, but if we think the pup may be too aggressive, we will ask them not to fly and refund their ticket.""

For over a decade, Steam company Valve’s biggest goal has been bringing Windows games to Linux. While that goal is almost complete with the massive success of Proton compatibility on Steam Deck and the upcoming Steam Machine, the company has also been secretly pushing to bring Windows games to ARM devices. 
In an interview with The Verge, Steam Deck and SteamOS lead Pierre-Loup Griffais revealed that Valve has been secretly funding Fex, an open-source project to bring Windows games to ARM, for almost a decade. 
“In 2016, 2017, there was always an idea we would end up wanting to do that,” the SteamOS lead said, and that’s when the Fex compatibility layer was started, because we knew there was close to a decade of work needed before it would be robust enough people could rely on it for their libraries. There’s a lot of work that went into that.”
“We’re pretty excited to be able to expand PC gaming to include all those options”
Griffais explained that the project pushes to “reduce barriers for users not having to worry about what games run”. With Windows games running on ARM, a large number of Steam games are able to run on a significant number of additional devices including low-power laptops, tablets and even phones (hopefully) without issue. 
While Griffais didn’t confirm specific devices that Valve is working on, the SteamOS lead explained that they’re “excited” about creating potential ARM-based devices. “I think that it paves the way for a bunch of different, maybe ultraportables, maybe more powerful laptops being ARM-based and using different offerings in that segment,” he said. “Handhelds, there’s a lot of potential for ARM, of course, and one might see desktop chips as well at some point in the ARM world.”
But why ARM? The Steam Deck lead explained that the hardware offers more efficiency at lower power compared to other options. While the current hardware in the Steam Deck and other handhelds can run at low-wattage, they’re simply less efficient at lower-power than hardware designed specifically to run at that spec. 
“There’s a lot of price points and power consumption points where Arm-based chipsets are doing a better job of serving the market,” they said.  “When you get into lower power, anything lower than Steam Deck, I think you’ll find that there’s an ARM chip that maybe is competitive with x86 offerings in that segment.”
“We’re pretty excited to be able to expand PC gaming to include all those options instead of being arbitrarily restricted to a subset of the market,” they continued. 
Valve is currently working on an ARM version of SteamOS using “the same exact OS components, the same exact Arch Linux base, all the same updater, all the same technologies,” Griffais said. 
“When  you’re looking at SteamOS on Arm, you’re really looking at the same thing,” he continued. “Instead of downloading the normal Proton that’s built for x86 and targets x86 games, it will also be able to download a Proton that’s Arm-aware, that has a bulk of its code compiled for Arm and can also include the Fex emulator.”
All of this is to give players a choice. While Windows games are built for Windows, they don’t necessarily need to be played on Windows. Valve has already proven how effective this can be with some games Windows running via Proton performing better due to the lack of Windows bloat. 
Nevertheless, there are issues. Some games have compatibility problems out of the box, and modern multiplayer games with anti-cheat simply do not work through a translation layer, something Valve hopes will change in the future. 
It’s all fantastic work though, and it gives players a chance to break away from Windows without losing much, if anything, when shifting ecosystems. For decades, Windows has dominated the PC space, and it likely still will for a long while, but now there’s actually space for alternatives to grow. 
We’ve already seen massive adoption of SteamOS via the Steam Deck, but with Bazzite now shifting petabytes of ISOs every month, there’s definitely an urge to move away from Windows, at least on the handheld side.

86,2025-12-03,"Micron is ditching Crucial to focus on supplying the AI market with RAM, which is bad news for PC builders and gamers.

It's a sad day to be a PC gamer, builder, or enthusiast, with Micron — a huge producer of random-access memory (RAM), solid-state drives (SSDs), and other storage solutions — announcing the end of Crucial, its brand of RAM kits and SSDs made available to consumers.
Crucial Consumer Business has been a major player in the PC building market since it was established nearly 30 years ago in 1996, competing with the likes of Samsung, SK Hynix, Corsair, and Seagate, among others. Now, though, it's being shuttered as Micron shifts its manufacturing efforts to focus solely on supporting AI companies.
The firm announced the news on Wednesday morning, explaining that the decision ""reflects Micron’s commitment to its ongoing portfolio transformation and the resulting alignment of its business to secular, profitable growth vectors in memory and storage.""
Its ultimate goal is to strengthen its business performance in the long-term and ""and create value for strategic customers as well as stakeholders"" — AKA, big corporations attempting to experiment with and develop artifical intelligence products, not people like you and I.
""The AI-driven growth in the data center has led to a surge in demand for memory and storage. Micron has made the difficult decision to exit the Crucial consumer business in order to improve supply and support for our larger, strategic customers in faster-growing segments,"" said Micron executive vice president and chief business officer Sumit Sadana in a statement.
“Thanks to a passionate community of consumers, the Crucial brand has become synonymous with technical leadership, quality and reliability of leading-edge memory and storage products. We would like to thank our millions of customers, hundreds of partners and all of the Micron team members who have supported the Crucial journey for the last 29 years,"" he added.
 



Micron says it's committed to continuing the sale of Crucial products until the end of its current second fiscal quarter, which is February 2026. Once March begins, however, you'll no longer be able to purchase Crucial RAM and SSD from PC part retailers.
All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.
The firm has also stated it ""will work closely with partners and customers through this transition,"" and that it will continue to provide support for Crucial products and fulfill any warranty obligations. Additionally, it intends to keep selling ""Micron-branded enterprise products to commercial channel customers globally.""
As for those working for the Crucial brand that will soon find themselves out of work, Micron has noted it intends to offer its employees ""redeployment opportunities"" for open positions elsewhere in the firm.
All in all, it's good that the company seems to be — or at least plans to be — handling the closure of Crucial ethically, but this is still a tragedy for consumers and hobbyists looking to build or purchase a PC. Not only are we losing a reputable and well-respected RAM and storage brand, but we're also likely going to see prices climb, too.
Indeed, the price of RAM has already skyrocketed due to a surge of demand from AI companies, resulting in kits themselves as well as devices with RAM in them becoming more and more difficult to afford. Demand for RAM is through the roof even as OpenAI declares ""code red"" and companies turn to debt to fund AI, with developers desperately investing more and more in the hopes for a grand payoff — and Micron is eager to provide supply.
Yes, it certainly makes sense from a business standpoint, but it sure does suck for the rest of us that want affordable RAM and storage for our gaming rigs and creative work PCs. The shortage of RAM on the market is already frustrating, and I'm not looking forward to it getting worse.
Micron's Crucial consumer RAM kits and storage devices and components like SSDs will continue to be sold until the end of February 2026. After that, Crucial products will no longer be available.
The recent, sharp increase in RAM prices is due to AI companies like OpenAI and Google demanding more and more of it for their infrastructure as they continue to expand their operations. That extremely high demand, and Micron's desire to supply it to majorly profit, is why the company is axing Crucial.

This week’s Future of TV Briefing looks at what TV and streaming companies’ latest quarterly earnings report indicate about the state of the streaming ad market.
The third quarter in a non-election year is typically a tricky time for TV and streaming advertising businesses. People usually spend less time in front of their TVs in July and August (at least until the NFL and college football seasons start). But Q3 earnings season can actually be a pretty great time to get a read on what TV network and streaming service owners’ ad businesses are up to.
During the latest quarterly earnings calls, executives from the major TV and streaming companies shared details on how their streaming businesses fared in the latest upfront cycle and teased out new ad products and capabilities. 
Some companies also shed light on how their streaming ad businesses currently stack up against their traditional TV ad businesses. So let’s start there. 
In short, they still don’t. Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery provide the clearest views of the dynamic, and at best streaming delivers 30% of the ad revenue of traditional TV. And that figure comes from Paramount, which saw 41% year-over-year declines in both TV and streaming ad revenue. 
Meanwhile, WBD’s streaming ad revenue increased by 15% year over year, which was not enough to outpace the 20% decline in TV ad revenue. 
The situation was similar at TelevisaUnivision where streaming ad revenue grew but not enough to offset declining TV ad revenue, leading to a $21.1 million decline in U.S. ad revenue.
The dynamic may not be all that different a year from now. 
NBCUniversal’s parent company Comcast president Mike Cavanagh said during the company’s most recent earnings call that Peacock represented one-third of the money advertisers committed to spend with NBCUniversal in this year’s upfront. That’s a 20% increase compared to the prior year’s upfront, but it still means traditional TV accounted for a significant majority of the company’s upfront haul. For what it’s worth, 
That said, streaming advertising is a growing business, unlike traditional TV advertising. AMC Networks reported a 40% year-over-year increase in digital ad commitments in this year’s upfront, but CEO Kristin Dolan didn’t provide any numbers to put that in context of its overall upfront haul. And Fox’s ad-supported streamer Tubi increased its ad revenue by 27% year over year and turned a quarterly profit for the first time.
Then there are the streaming-only ad sellers like Netflix and Roku. “We more than doubled our U.S. upfront commitments,” Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters said during its earnings call. And Roku CFO and COO Dan Jedda said the company’s ad prices are higher in Q4 2025 compared to Q4 2024 as a result of this year’s upfront deals, “which is different than last upfront.”
YouTube’s (grand)parent company Alphabet didn’t divulge how the platform did in this year’s upfront, but this is the best place I could think to cite a stat that covers a year-long timeframe: YouTube is on track to generate $1 billion in annual revenue from interactive, direct-response ads served on TV screens, per Alphabet svp and chief business officer Phillip Schindler.
TelevisaUnivision didn’t break out streaming’s impact on its upfront market, but it did tease out the importance of streaming ad capabilities exceeding traditional TV’s. “Our household graph powered record volume this year, with 100% of streaming commitments activated through the graph’s advanced targeting capabilities,” said CEO Daniel Alegre during its earnings call.
That helps to explain why there was plenty of talk about advanced streaming ad capabilities across company earnings calls. 
Paramount, for example, is in the midst of unifying its three streaming services – Paramount+, Pluto TV and BET+ – onto a single tech stack that will, among other benefits, “improve our capabilities across the ad tech we’ll be able to deploy,” said chairman and CEO David Ellison. 
And then Netflix and Roku each talked up their respective deals to make ad inventory available through Amazon’s demand-side platform. Netflix’s Peters called out programmatic as an incremental revenue growth area, though some of that boost will have to wait until 2027 when it introduces new advanced measurement and advanced targeting capabilities.
Disney is also upgrading its streaming tech in a way that could benefit its streaming ad business. 
“Regarding Disney+, we’re in the midst of rolling out the biggest and the most significant changes from a product perspective, from a technology perspective, since we launched the service in 2019. And we’re really encouraged because it’s enabling greater personalization, resulting in a product that’s just more dynamic, more engaging and basically it’s working,” said Disney CEO Bob Iger during the company’s earnings call. 
Obviously, he didn’t explicitly say anything about ad-related benefits, but when I hear “greater personalization,” I think “ad targeting.” And when I think “ad targeting,” I also think “scale” because what good is it to carve up an audience if the resulting audience segments are too small to be of much interest to advertisers. Which would mean Netflix and Disney are expecting to further scale up their ad-supported audiences and would help to explain why AMC Networks talked up its inventory-carving capabilities during its quarterly earnings call.
A year after signing a deal to make AMC+’s ad-supported tier available to Charter’s pay-TV subscribers, AMC Networks’ Dolan said that more than 850,000 people “have opted into AMC plus since its inclusion in the package earlier this year.” 
And now AMC Networks is opening up more of its ad inventory to dynamic ad insertion, or being able to slot in different ads for different audiences versus the typical “everyone sees the same ad” model. DAI “actually allows us an opportunity to cross-sell across all our platforms, including CTV” and soon horror-centric streamer Shudder’s ad-supported tier, said chief commercial officer Kim Kelleher.
“We have a PMP with [Netflix] through The Trade Desk, and it’s pretty annoying. You have to have a separate tag for every single creative. So you can’t rotate creative.”

89,2025-12-03,"The iPhone 17 lineup includes a new Ceramic Shield 2 with anti-reflective technology, but it turns out standard screen protectors aren’t the best match for the new displays.
One of the tentpole features of the iPhone 17 line is Ceramic Shield 2. The new display technology is available across iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, and iPhone Air.
Per Apple: “Ceramic Shield 2 [has] a new Apple-designed coating for 3x better scratch resistance and improved anti-reflection to reduce glare.”
In theory, Ceramic Shield 2 should give iPhone 17 users more confidence in going without a screen protector.
Understandably though, lots of us would feel safer adding an extra layer of protection to the pricey new iPhone.
But a study published today by Astropad offers another reason to skip standard screen protectors.
Per the company’s testing, the iPhone 17’s new anti-reflective upgrades are completely lost—and then some—with the average screen protector.
In other words, an out of the box iPhone 17 offers nearly twice as good anti-reflection as its predecessor. 
But because of the way Ceramic Shield 2’s anti-reflective coating works, if you apply a standard screen protector, reflectivity gets significantly worse. Giovanni Donelli writes:
With iPhone 17, AR [anti-reflective] protection is applied directly to the glass. When a screen protector is installed, the protector adheres to the iPhone display with a thin layer of adhesive. However, because AR coatings are tuned for and rely on direct contact with air, covering the coating with glue essentially cancels its effectiveness.  The coating is still present, but it can’t function properly while covered.
While testing, we found that screen protectors without their own anti-reflective coating caused enough interference to effectively double the amount of reflectivity on the display!  The AR coating can’t function properly because it’s no longer in contact with air.
What’s the solution? Astropad recommends a screen protector with built-in anti-reflective features, like its own Fresh Coat product.
If you’re in the market for an iPhone 17 screen protector, the full study is well worth a read.

90,2025-12-03,"Following pushback from a mandate requiring phones in India to come pre-installed with a state-owned, undeletable app, the government is now saying that the app may be deleted if users choose to do so.
The move, however, is unlikely to change Apple’s refusal to comply with the order. Here are the details.
Last week, the Indian government issued a directive requiring smartphone makers to pre-install a state-owned app called Sanchar Saathi.
The Indian government has been promoting Sanchar Saathi as a security app, offering tools to report stolen devices, block a phone’s unique IMEI number with carriers, and report spam or scam phone numbers.
Earlier today, Reuters reported that Apple would not comply with the mandate:
Apple however does not plan to comply with the directive and will tell the government it does not follow such mandates anywhere in the world as they raise a host of privacy and security issues for the company’s iOS ecosystem, said two of the industry sources who are familiar with Apple’s concerns. They declined to be named publicly as the company’s strategy is private.
One of the many sticking points of the mandate was the apparent requirement for the app to be undeletable, in addition to being either pre-installed on new devices or automatically installed via a software update.
Now, the Indian government appears to have softened its stance on the requirement for the app to be undeletable, although it is still apparently requiring it to be pre-installed or auto-installed by manufacturers:
#SancharSaathi puts digital safety in your hands. Pre-installed for your protection, but for user its completely optional. So you can decide what stays on your device.#DoT #Telecommunications #CyberSecurity #DoTForDigitalSafety@JM_Scindia @PemmasaniOnX @neerajmittalias… pic.twitter.com/MhDMVuRxNE
This partial shift is unlikely to change Apple’s stance on the matter, since it doesn’t address the company’s other concerns regarding privacy and security.
This impasse comes at a time when India plays an increasingly important role in Apple’s business, both as a manufacturing alternative to China and as a rapidly growing consumer market, and it adds to a recent dispute involving a potential $38B antitrust fine in the country.
Whether any of this may cause the local government (or even Apple) to take action against the company’s domestic operations in the country remains to be seen.
Google, meanwhile, has yet to weigh in, as the company hasn’t replied to multiple news outlets’ requests to comment on the issue or to clarify whether it intends to comply or similarly refuse the mandate.

93,2025-12-03,"In 1953 Egon Eiermann, a German architect and proponent of functionalism, designed this no-frills desk for himself. His aim was to make it as minimalist as possible.

Eiermann was a professor at the Technische Hochschule Karlsruhe (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology). Architecture students began producing the desk in the school's shop, for use around campus. The school continued producing the desk thru the 1950s and '60s.

The desk had never seen formal production, but in the 1990s, German furniture manufacturer Richard Lampert picked up the rights, and started selling the desk as the Eiermann 1. It did well on the market, and was recognized as a design classic.
 
In the 2020s, Tim Schütze was an Industrial Design student at the Berlin University of Arts. For his Masters project, he chose to give the Eiermann desk a modern upgrade: Making it a sit-stand desk. 

 
To gain the height adjustability without tacking on a bulky motor, which would compromise Eiermann's intended aesthetic, Schütze devised a belt-drive mechanism that turned threaded spindles in the legs. He used 3D-printed components for the mechanism.
 

 
The user manually pulls on the belt to change the table's height.
 

 
After graduating, Schütze collaborated with Richard Lampert. The Eiermann M (for mechanical), as the update is called, is now in production.

95,2025-12-03,"Today’s 9to5Toys Lunch Break is kicking off with even lower prices on iPhone – you’ll now find 1TB iPhone 16 Pro Max models at up to $580 off via Amazon renewed Premium (among others). We also still have AirPods Pro 4 with ANC down at the wild $99 deal price, but this morning also ushered back in the Cyber Monday deal on AirPods Pro 2 at $114 off alongside a new all-time low on the official Apple Crossbody iPhone Strap and its 2025 model Neon Green Ocean Band. Hit the jump for a closer look. 
We detailed some notable chances to land a big-time price drop on iPhone 16 Pro Max (and other models) during Black Friday this year, and prices are now even lower on just about all color options – you can score a 1TB iPhone 16 Pro Max at $580 off the list price courtesy of Amazon’s top-tier Renewed Premium program.
The official Renewed Premium listings at Amazon for Apple’s 1TB iPhone 16 Pro Max are now live once again at$1,019 shipped on all four colors – that’s $580 off the original $1,599 list price and the unlocked price of the comparable 17 Pro.
We recently detailed the Amazon Renewed Premium program over at 9to5Mac. You can get more details on these listings there, but the short-form takeaway here is you’ll want to stick with the listings sold and shipped directly from Amazon (not just those that say Renewed Premium in the product name) – this will be your best option and the one with the return guarantee and 1-year warranty.
Woot landed with what was arguably one of, if not, the best deals on AirPods Pro 2 for Cyber Monday at $134.99 shipped – that’s $114 off the original list price. While we did see some extremely short lived offers at other retailers in and around $120, those deals went out of stock extremely fast, much like we saw on this Woot deal this past Monday. But, it has now returned with a new listing at the same priceand the proper 1-year Apple warranty too.
Woot is now once again offering AirPods Pro 2 down at $134.99 with free shipping for Prime members (a $6 delivery fee will apply otherwise). Originally $249 before being replaced by the new AirPods Pro 3 that fetch the same priceand have never dropped below $220 in straight up cash discounts, you’re looking at as much as $114 in savings and the lowest price we can find with a proper Apple warranty in brand new condition.
This is the latest version of Apple’s AirPods Pro 2 with the H2 chip and the MagSafe USB-C case.
For the record, Amazon is completely out of stock on the Pro 2 set and Best Buy is charging $189. 
While, for some, landing a pair of AirPods Pro 2 now that the latest series 3 set is already out is a bit underwhelming, or even pointless, some folks still swear by these Apple buds. It is probably worth remembering we are talking about some of the most popular earbuds on the planet and what many considered to be the very best ever released not more than a few months ago. 
The chances of landing the new AirPods Pro 3 anywhere near a price like this in brand new condition is slim to none. There might be some folks with a horde of gift cards or something along those lines scoring deals, but when it comes to straight up cash deals, it wouldn’t be surprising to see a year or (much) more go by before the new set lands at over $100 off – they were $30 off for Black Friday this year.
Update 12/3: Amazon has now dropped a series of additional colorways back down to the Cyber Monday lows mentioned above.
Alongside the ongoing and particularly amazing 45% price drop on AirPods 4 with ANC at $99, we are also still seeing some of the Apple Watch Series 11 Cyber Monday all-time lows live at Amazon. Configuration options are starting to jump back up in price as of this morning though, so you’ll want to get in there as soon as possible if you want to score the special holiday pricing. 
We saw some $50 price drops ahead of Black Friday, and then some $60 price drops for Thanksgiving, but Cyber Monday delivered the best deals to date on Apple Watch Series 11 at $70 off the list price. Costco members were privy to slightly deeper price drop for a brief time yesterday evening, but that deal came and went very quickly. 
As of right now, there are still some configs sitting down at the Amazon all-time low prices and you can scope them out below:
All of the prices listed above are indeed matching or within $1 of the lowest we have tracked on Amazon and the best we tracked for Black Friday weekend, outside of the limited Costco deal. 
Well ahead of Black Friday we specifically targeted/predicted a max $70 price drop on Series 11, and that’s exactly what we got, it just happened to take until Cyber Monday to get it. Nonetheless, there is still a chance to land that deal now and there’s no telling what pricing will look like between now and holiday deliver cut off times otherwise. 
The countdown clocks on this year’s ecobee smart home gear and intelligent thermostat Black Friday deals are now rolling. According to Amazon, today will be your last chance to secure one of the brand’s smart HomeKit thermostat models, including everything from its entry-level 2025 edition right through to the premium model and some of the sensor accessories that (optionally) go along with them. Scope out the deals below while you still can.
The Black Friday deals gave way to slightly lower prices on select gear for Cyber Monday – all of these offers are live at Amazonand also at Home Depot where it is unclear whether or not they will end tonight or not. Either way you can still score the deals, and this might be your last shot at them:
The offers also sit alongside some larger bundles that package up a more complete setup with, in some cases, some extra savings:
