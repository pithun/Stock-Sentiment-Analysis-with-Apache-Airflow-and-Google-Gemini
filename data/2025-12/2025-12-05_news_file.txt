I wonder if any of them advocated for this sale internally because they would seem to be a massive conflict of interest...or if they knew about the acquisition pitch before it was public knowledge and used that insider knowledge to buy even more Warner stock...(or if they get insider information that the sale isn't going through, and then sell their Warner stock before that news drops...)

This transactions is very sketchy and will be investigated for decades.And the outcome will be precisely fuck all. Antitrust laws in America governing American corporations have no teeth what so ever. The DoJ barely investigates them and when they do they loose on technicalities.The investigations are just a cost of doing business at this point.

Gonna give this deal the benefit of the doubt.
We do not need 50 streaming providers, we need at most 4.
Netflix acquiring certain properties (eg DC) that WB has so far fumbled endlessly might actually give those properties new life. OR...
Netflix will let the WB morons keep running their properties nose-first into the ground. Like my ideal situation here is that Netflix buys out all of WB's properties, and cuts everything else adrift. HBO goes back to being HBO, Discovery goes back to being Discovery, and all 
That idea works in theory where there isn't any negatives. The problem is there always is. Your goal is to consume media. Do you care about quality? Netflix is the antithesis for that. Their goal is for you to consider them the second screen.
Second.
Not first. Not only. They are not trying to engage you. They want to be on in the background so you feel a connection to them to not cancel your service, essential noise while you doom scroll.

Exactly. Streaming is close to a natural monopoly.

Only because cable was still competition.
These days, if you believe Netflix wouldn't be just another cable company when they're the only streaming game in town, I've got a bridge to sell you.
They're still the market movers - ever notice Netflix jacks up their price, then all the other streaming services follow? Or how Netflix stops password sharing, then the others follow?
If that age had persisted, it would not have remained gold for very long.  Monopolies invariably jack up prices for the consumer (since they have no where to turn) and ratchet down payments to their providers (since they have no other platform to use).  They burn the candle at both ends, as brightly as they can, for as long as they can, until something collapses.  That is exactly the direction Netflix was moving in and exactly what motivated many content holders to go build their own platform.
So that is our 
I've said a for awhile now that in the age of streaming services content owners should *have to license* their content out to other services at a reasonable cost.
Or really just go back to the Paramount Decree [wikipedia.org] style of things and say that you can be a delivery service or a production service but not both.
I'd gladly want for ""you can be the delivery or the production but not both""
I've been thinking about this since Comcast bought NBC.  Seemed bullshit that the cable company and the internet provider can also own such a large production that it can isolate for itself (if it wanted to).   Really the only consumer upside of that one was the Kabletown jokes on 30 Rock
Do you think that HBO Max + Netflix will cost the same as Netflix does now?
I swear people who insist there's something terrible about multiple streaming services can't see the wood for the trees. HBO Max and Disney+ and Hulu and Netflix and Paramount+ and Peacock and Prime all merging into one service doesn't mean a single service for $10 a month, it means a single service for $150 a month.
I would rather just continue the status quo. Have them compete with one another, and let me switch subscriptions every few months to get the content I didn't get with the others.
It saves Netflix the trouble of developing a bunch of new content. They're gaining access to a giant back catalog of top notch programming, one of the major studios (DC) regularly making blockbusters, and even perhaps some customers. Overall, is expect a bunch of synergy out of this deal. The price will be way lower than Netflix+Max.
Yeah, look at how Disney's and Hulu's prices came down after that merger!
Oh, wait...
That analogy doesn't really hold much water. Those services were essentially serving two different market segments. Bundling ESPN with Disney is a very different thing from - say - bundling Disney with Looney Toons.
Yeah, look at how Disney's and Hulu's prices came down after that mergerYou can add an ad-free Hulu subscription for $1 per month once you subscribe to Disney+ (ad-free). I'm not sure Disney really needed the content as much as they wanted the subscriber base that they could glam on to their existing packages. I'm not sure it has been profitable, and will take a long time to pay off that $9 billion investment.

I don't expect Netflix pricing to stay the same.
But the main reason this is happening is there are too many streaming services for them all to be viable. This isn't a merger of equals. HBO Max isn't sustainable right now. Not enough people are willing to pay their asking price to keep it going.
You merge the services, cut your operating costs, and raise Netflix prices a little.
And maybe we see Netflix take advantage of Warner's distribution systems and get more Netflix content in theaters and on DVD/Bluray.
For the record there is no law or ""right"" to mergers and acquisitions, we've just been acclimated to this type of thing being so regular that we accept it as just the way things have to be.  Corporations as a legal structure only exist at the behest of the laws we allow them to exist under.
We the people (as in the government) can simply say ""No, WB, you don't get to sell or merge"" or we can just say neither of these companies get to buy it since they already hold such a large share of the industry already. 
Has there ever been a merger flat out denied in the past 50 years? At most we get a few back and forths with some lip service about being better for the consumer.
Has a merger ever decreased prices?
Has there ever been a merger flat out denied in the past 50 years? Less than 50 years ago, AT&T tried to buy T-Mobile and was told by the regulators to pound sand.

Assuming you live in a society with property rights, you do in fact have the right to both buy and sell that property. Like all rights, it's not absolute and can be limited in special circumstances. Corporations are just legal mechanisms for multiple people to share certain of their individual rights, most prominently property rights.

Time Warner's financials were in dire straits in 2004 as well with a load of debt from the AOL merger. That time, they paid their debt by selling Dire Straits and the rest of Warner Music Group to Edgar Bronfman Jr.

Sure but these aren't private proprietorships or just a sale of assets.  The Clayton Act exists, has precedent and is pretty broad, there is a line and this merger is well over it.  The government is fully in it's rights to at the least deny sale to either of these parties (and IMO should)
For all their ""losses"" they were also able to pay down their debt in 2024 with $4.4B in cash flow (which got Zaslav a big fat bonus).  Like all Hollywood accounting the numbers can be suspect.

The merger is a bad idea, but the comment ""threatening to force Americans into higher subscription prices and fewer choices over what and how they watch, "" is a bit too far.

Sailing the high seas may be more popular, but given how little is worth watching it's a minor issue.

Some people insist that they do need to see the content.  They were often brought up in an environment where they were told they can have it all.  And every politician will always promise everything for free (or at least cheap), as that is the way to get (re)elected.

It's going to be like the ill-fated AOL Time Warner acquisition all over again.
The real question is ""Will they re-release the roadrunner cartoons?"".
Came here to say exactly this. Funny how Warner Brother's keeps getting acquired by tech companies that imagine themselves to be movie studios. Tech companies keep forgetting that they are good at...tech. Being a successful movie studio is a very, very different thing. Companies do best when they stay in their lane.
I don't think so.   Netflix is known for shows and movies they have made, so buying WB isn't going into an area they have not been involved in.   AT&T also made mistakes, because being involved in communications is very different than creating things that in turn get distributed.
It's going to be like the ill-fated AOL Time Warner acquisition all over again.What do you mean? That acquisition was great -- for AOL stockholders and insiders.

I was an AOL stockholder.  It was certainly not great.  The only thing it did was accelerate the demise of AOL.
but the least overlap was with netflix.Netflix and warner only overlap in streamingParamount, Comcast and warner also overlap in streaming.
Meanwhile paramount and Comcast also have a major Movie Studio business, a TV production businness, tentpole franchises, and TV/Cable Channels.
Way too much overlap both in the USoA and Outside the USoA. even if you say that in the USoA the cards were stacked in favour of Paramount, outside the USoA, Netflix was the one with the least regulatory backlash...
Maybe the kids at warner can teach netflix a thing ot two:
- How to make each seasson of a show come exactly one year after the last seasson.- Release a movie in an adequate theather exclusive Window, perhaps smaller than the current WB one, but muach, much longer than netflix's one- Dump 2 or 3 episodes of a TV series at once for the premiere, and then drop the rest week by week to build momentum and word of mouth, so that good series have more chance to survive- to license their old content to cable/tv cha 
Paramount's final bid, received Thursday evening, was for $30 per share, all cash, people close to the matter told CNBC, speaking on the condition of anonymity about confidential dealings. Paramount's offer included a $5 billion breakup fee if the transaction didn't win regulatory approval after roughly 10 months, the people said.

As Austin Dean was earning his various financial advisor certifications, he wasn't fully satisfied with the curriculum that revolved around traditional wisdom — particularly the advice to max out retirement accounts.
He was in his early 20s at the time and personally interested in the financial independence movement. The thought of ""locking up"" his savings in accounts that wouldn't be accessible until age 59 ½ wasn't appealing.
""I was like, 'There's got to be a better way. I don't want to have to wait until I'm 60 to be able to feel like I have the financial flexibility to do the things I want to do,'"" the founder and CEO of Waystone Advisors, an RIA firm that specializes in helping people achieve financial independence in non-traditional ways, told Business Insider.
He started digging into what the top 1% do — and their strategies were entirely different.
""The most wealthy don't get there by maximizing their 401(k)s and making coffee at home,"" said Dean, who has ChFC, CLU, CFP, and RICP designations. ""They started businesses, they bought businesses, they invested in real estate, they prioritized cash flow, they became the bank.""
Dean refers to retirement-specific accounts such as 401(k) plans and IRAs as ""money jail."" They're excellent savings vehicles with strong tax benefits, but you typically can't access your contributions without incurring a 10% fee until you reach age 59 ½. This rule is in place to encourage individuals to keep their retirement money invested, rather than dipping into it for short-term goals.
Another consequence of maxing out tax-deferred retirement accounts may arise years later when you must start withdrawing from them in your 70s — the IRS calls these required minimum distributions (RMDs), and they're calculated based on your account balance and life expectancy. If you don't start taking RMDs, you could incur a 25% penalty.
""The IRS very reasonably says, 'We haven't gotten our piece of that,' and you need to start pulling that money out,"" he explained. However, if you've been fiscally savvy and built income streams that provide enough cash flow to live on without needing the retirement account funds, you're ""unfortunately stuck in this position of having to pull that money out anyway and then pay taxes on it. Retirement accounts take away our control and put it in the hands of the IRS.""
Dean isn't discouraging saving for retirement; he just believes there's a more efficient way to save that gives investors, particularly those interested in early retirement, more control and flexibility.
The non-traditional solution he provides for his clients is to obtain a securities-backed line of credit (SBLOC). This is a type of loan in which an investor uses their stock portfolio or other assets, including their fine art and luxury yachts, as collateral. It allows for quick access to cash without having to sell investments and trigger a capital gains tax — and the investor can then pump that cash into other investments, such as starting a business or purchasing real estate.
""Now, your money is doing two things at the same time: It's in the market, and it's being used for other wealth-building tools,"" said Dean.
The main risk is pulling out too much money, and the stock market crashes, he explained: ""We recommend always leaving a buffer between what you are approved for and what is being used. I also recommend having other liquid assets or lines of credit in reserve, in case the market takes an unexpected swing. But if someone has an account that is properly diversified, leaves a 20% buffer on their line of credit, and has other flexible and uncorrelated assets, they should be able to weather meaningful market volatility.""
SBLOCs are popular among high-net-worth individuals. Elon Musk, for example, ""used a line of credit on his Tesla stock to go and buy Twitter and create X,"" explained Dean.
However, individuals with five-figure savings can also benefit, he said: ""If somebody has as little as $50,000 to $60,000 in an investment account, we can help them set up a securities-backed line of credit for like $35,000 to $40,000. Then they can use that to go buy their first rental property.""
Even if you have the ability to use an SBLOC, this strategy may not be for you, he added: ""First and foremost, figure out what your goals are. If your goal is to have a bunch of money in retirement accounts at 60 or 65, then keep doing that.""
He also noted that he doesn't advise clients who already have a sizable nest egg tied up in retirement accounts to liquidate and incur penalties. But, if they're looking to achieve financial independence and retire early, he typically recommends lowering their contributions to just enough to take advantage of a 401(k) match, which is essentially free money.
Another strategy he discusses with clients is funding a self-directed IRA, which allows them to invest in alternatives inside their IRA.
""The younger the person, the more likely we are to not use a self-directed IRA because we'd rather have their money not in 'money jail' and able to do two or more things at once with an SBLOC or well-designed whole life policy,"" he said. But for clients in their 50s or older with a large amount of money in retirement accounts, ""a self-directed IRA is a way for them to access unique alternative investments to help diversify their assets and create income without needed to liquidate their retirement accounts and pay taxes and penalties.""
Dean understands that non-traditional planning isn't for everyone, but wants investors to understand all of their options.
""I find the traditional wisdom of 'you should max fund your 401(k) or your IRA' to be damaging,"" he said. ""When people come to us, and they're like, 'OK, I want financial independence,' but then realize all of the money they've been working hard to save, they can't access without giving up at least 10% plus taxes — that can be really disheartening.""

Billionaire Masayoshi Son has a plan to use hundreds of billions of dollars from Japan to build Trump-branded industrial parks on federal land across the U.S., according to a new report from the Wall Street Journal. The plan is to manufacture high-tech hardware, and while the details are reportedly still being hammered out, it all sounds pretty wild. The Journal’s description of the early plans: “…ambitious to the point of science fiction.”
Internally at Softbank, where Son is CEO, the project was dubbed Project Crystal Land and has been in the works for about six months, according to the Journal. Early versions of the idea imagined a new $1 trillion city in the Arizona desert outside of Phoenix that was pitched to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick as a competitor to China’s Shenzhenâthe heart of the country’s tech sector, which borders Hong Kong.
By the summer, Son pitched his idea directly to President Trump, according to the Journal, and it included some of the most futuristic elements, including “robot-filled semiconductor-fabrication plants.” The new city would have housing for workers, and it all sounds very similar to something Trump first pitched in March 2023, when the 2024 presidential election was still a year and a half away.
Back in 2023, Trump dubbed them “freedom cities,” and they were to be built on federal land, much like Son’s idea. Almost 40% of Arizona is federally owned. The possible difference between the vision for freedom cities in 2023 and 2026 is likely to be a new emphasis on artificial intelligence. Back in 2023, Trump was talking about the need for futuristic transportation, including flying cars. AI, as we use the term today, was still relatively new at the time, since ChatGPT was launched in November 2022.
âJust as the United States led the automotive revolution in the last century, I want to ensure that America, not China, leads the revolution in air mobility. These breakthroughs can transform commerce, bring a giant infusion of wealth into rural America, and connect families in our country in new ways,â said Trump in a 2023 video.
Son reportedly revised his “new city” plan to a smaller scale, according to the Journal, dropping the part about high-tech robotics and housing for workers. But the idea for industrial parks remains and would be paid for using Japanese investment dollars, which were committed in July as part of a trade deal with the United States. Tariffs on Japanese cars were dropped from 25% to 15% and Japan committed $550 billion of investment into U.S. industry.
The Trump administration reportedly wants to funnel that money into Son’s idea for Project Crystal Land and is apparently pitching partnerships with Japanese companies like TDK, Mitsubishi Electric, and Hitachi. Eventually, Son wants to build chip-manufacturing plants that could compete with the most advanced plants in Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan.
A photo posted to the White House Flickr page last month captured Son wearing a “4 More Years!” hat in the Oval Office while shaking hands with Speaker of the House Mike Johnson. Son was on hand that day as President Trump signed the bill that reopened the government after a historically long shutdown, and Lutnick could be seen just behind the two men.
Lutnick, who has previously hyped the idea of building new factories dominated by robots, has been working with the Department of the Interior on using federal land for Son’s industrial parks, according to the Journal. Lutnick came under fire in April for suggesting any new jobs would primarily go to robots while American workers screwed in little screws for iPhones.
The idea for so-called new cities has a long history in 20th-century futurism, especially when it comes to testing out new technology. The most famous might be EPCOT, Walt Disney’s Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow. The original plan was to build a real working city where new technologies in everything from communications to transportation could be tried with real people. But after Disney died in 1966, the plan morphed from a real city into a theme park.
The Journal cautions that Son’s plan may never get off the ground. The newspaper cites sources who claim that funding for the project could come as soon as the first quarter of 2026. But it also notes that SoftBank pledged $500 billion for the Stargate data center project in a big White House announcement back in January while standing next to Trump, Larry Ellison, and Sam Altman. That project has yet to actually happen and has mostly consisted of splashy announcements.
Another big hurdle might be the fact that successful businesses may not be interested in the project to build industrial parks here in the U.S. Taiwan’s TSMC has reportedly told Son they don’t want to participate. And just about everyone on Wall Street is currently nervous about the AI bubble potentially bursting. The entire U.S. economy seems to be propped up on a technology with plenty of hype but hasn’t shown a path to profitability anytime soon.
But who knows? Mainstream economists were all convinced that Trump’s tariffs, first announced on April 2, would devastate the economy. And while there have been some modest job losses and a slight rise in inflation, it’s nowhere near the apocalyptic scenarios that were envisioned. It’s entirely possible that Trump’s economy chugs along on fumes for years before it putters out. Or it could all come crashing down tomorrow. If you know the answer to that, you could stand to make some serious money in the stock market.
The problem, as always when predicting the future, is that nobody seems to know.

LEGOs are fun to build on your own, and even more enjoyable when doing it with friends. If youâre a fan of the galaxy far, far away or have a little one who just canât seem to stop talking about the identity and origin of Supreme Leader Snoke, thereâs a way to bring an important part of Star Wars to your living room this holiday season.
The LEGO Star Wars: Attack of the Clones Jango Fett’s Starshipset, which usually goes for around $70, just dropped to $56 at Amazon. Thatâs after the retailer slashed 20% off its retail tag, making the purchase quite affordable. The offer can be grabbed by both Prime and non-Prime members. Even better, all shoppers get to enjoy free delivery with their purchase, so there are no extra costs to worry about. However, we highly recommend getting your orders in quickly because the holiday rush is in full swing, and deals are moving fast.
See at Amazon
The set is made for ages 9 and up, and comes with a total of 707 pieces. Itâs not massive, which is great if youâre planning to grab it for kids and donât want to overwhelm them with a large project. Itâs going to be one of those fun sets that can be brought to life by dedicating just a few hours during the weekend. Since the holiday season is upon us, everyone in the family can join in; maybe by the fireplace with some hot chocolate. Play the Star Wars theme song in the background to get in the feels!
Youâll be building Jango Fett (with dual blasters and jetpack), who is a simple man trying to make his way in the universe, young Boba Fett learning all about family trade, and tall Kaminoan Lama Su minifigures, plus the stunning starship. The attention to detail on the starship is incredible, since it features authentic rotating wings, four stud shooters, and a seismic charge-dropping function for some cool, explosive escapes just in the asteroid chase scene. Thereâs also an opening cockpit for two minifigures to jump in for some adventures across the Outer Rim, as well as a mobile service cart with ammunition storage. The latter doubles as a display stand.
Once built, the starship is going to measure over 3.5 in. (9 cm) high, 8 in. (21 cm) long, and 8.5 in. (21 cm) wide. Itâs going to look stunning on its own, but you can always pair it with others in the LEGO Star Wars collection for a bigger setup that spans multiple star systems. The set also comes with a detailed instruction book thatâs going to take younger fans through each step one by one. Itâs quite easy to follow, so kids will be able to build on their own. For even more assistance, you can install the LEGO Builder app, which offers digital, 3D instructions. Kids can zoom in from every angle, track their progress, and save sets. The app also makes it easy to build with friends. In this mode, it divides tasks between everyone on board, so everyone can complete their own.
The current discount brings the price of the starship model to just $56. Youâre saving a nice 20% on a set any Star Wars fan is going to love and cherish. If you like it, donât wait too long to grab it. Once the discount is gone, we canât say whether it will be back anytime soon.

I love winter, but I am definitely the complaining type. Anything below 15 degrees is a bit too cold for me, and the same is the case during summer; above 30Â°C is basically the boiling point. If you can relate and are looking for a year-round solution that offers both focused and diffused modes, the Dyson Hot plus Cool AM09 Jet Focus heater and fan is an excellent option to consider, especially at its current price.
Right now, you can pick it up for just $350 at Amazon, after the retailer took a whopping $150 off its usual price. Itâs a post Black Friday deal that made it through the main event, but it wonât be around forever. It wonât be long before the price shoots back up, so itâs best to get your orders in quickly.
See at Amazon
Itâs Dyson, so as youâd expect, the overall design is quite minimal. The solid base makes it easy to place it just about anywhere, from the middle of the lounge to a corner of your room. Year-round comfort is made possible with its dual capabilities; cools you in summer and warms you up when things start to get chilly.
The fan uses an Air Multiplier technology that amplifies the surrounding air to give you a smooth, uninterrupted airflow. There are two operating modes to choose from. The Focused mode delivers fast, personal heating or cooling, while the Diffused mode gently adjusts the temperature of your entire room. Speaking of temperature, you can adjust it anywhere from 32 to 98.6Â°F. For instance, in winters, if youâve just come home after spending time with friends on a chilly evening, go for the focused mode to relax your body a bit, and then switch to the Diffused mode to warm the entire room up. The ceramic plates heat up fast, so you wonât have to wait too long for the thing to work, either. When using the diffused mode, the fan oscillates at a 70Â° angle to direct airflow around the room evenly.
It also works fairly quietly, which is great if you want to take a nap with it running. Whatâs more, you can create sleep timers to program the fan to turn off after pre-set intervals. These can range anywhere from 15 minutes to 9 hoursâ. The included remote makes it easy to do this and more. You can adjust the temperature, switch modes, create schedules, etc. Itâs also magnetized, so you can store it neatly on the fan itself and never lose track of it.
This deal brings the price of this smart, multifunctional fan to just $350, saving you $150 on your purchase. It can be used in both summer and winter, doesnât make an annoying sound while working, and even lets you set timers for added convenience. The Silver finish gives off a premium look, so it can blend into any setup with ease. And since the fan isn’t cordless, you donât have to worry about running out of power when you need it the most. Just plug it into an outlet, and enjoy an uninterrupted stream of airflow for hours. Again, the retailer has listed it as a limited-time discount, so we donât expect it to last long. In fact, it might not even make it through the weekend. If youâve been after a unit that works as both a heater and a fan, now is the time to make the move.

Ulta Beauty's bet to expand its South Korean beauty collection is paying off, driving sales and bringing in new customers.
In a Thursday earnings call, Ulta Beauty CEO Kecia Steelman said the company's K-beauty assortment ""continues to resonate and drive skincare sales.""
She said that aside from its long-standing exclusive sales partnership with skincare and beauty brand Peach & Lily, it expanded its K-beauty brand portfolio in 2025.
""We saw space for growing K-beauty trends in both skincare and makeup,"" Steelman said to investors. ""We moved with agility to build a complementary and largely exclusive pipeline, including a portfolio of new and many exclusive brands throughout 2025, like a new Medicube, TIRTIR, Fwee, and Unleashia.""
Ulta Beauty is the only US retailer selling products from beauty-tech company Medicube, which has been promoted by celebrities such as Kylie Jenner and Hailey Bieber.
Steelman added that some K-beauty brands, like pimple-patch brand Starface, ""benefited from newness and social media virality."" The brand sells cute, colorful pimple patches, shaped like stars and cartoon characters.
She said the brands are attracting ""the next generation"" of customers.
Ulta Beauty posted third-quarter results on Thursday, reporting net sales of $2.9 billion, a 12.9% increase from the same period a year ago. Its same-store sales increased 6.3% year-on-year.
The company's stock price rose by almost 6% in after-hours trading on Thursday. It's up about 33% in the past year.
This comes as K-beauty is establishing a strong fan base in the US. Data from marketing research firm NielsenIQ showed that K-beauty was a $2 billion industry in the US in the year leading up to July 2025, a 37% from the same period the year before.
Beauty retail experts told Business Insider in October that the draw of K-beauty was their affordable price point.
Anna Keller, a principal analyst from London-based market research firm Mintel, told Business Insider, ""They're super affordable, so you're getting high-quality, effective products without breaking the bank.""
Ulta Beauty and Sephora are attempting to secure exclusive sales partnerships with K-beauty brands before the mega South Korean beauty retailer, Olive Young, makes its highly anticipated debut in the US next year.

10,2025-12-05,"Netflix today announced that it will acquire Warner Bros. Discovery's vast studios and streaming operations for $82.7 billion.
The transaction will see Netflix acquire Warner Bros., HBO, and HBO Max in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $72 billion in equity and $82.7 billion, including debt (via Reuters). The acquisition gives it control of major franchises, including DC, Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, Looney Tunes, and the Warner Bros. film library, dramatically expanding the volume and diversity of content available under one streaming umbrella. The acquisition also gives Netflix the established HBO brand and its library of prestige television series such as The Sopranos, Succession, and The Wire.
Netflix said that it intends to maintain Warner Bros.' theatrical distribution, preserve HBO Max as a discrete service in the near term, and integrate HBO and Warner Bros. content into its own catalog.

Netflix confirmed that each Warner Bros. Discovery shareholder will receive $23.25 in cash and $4.50 in Netflix stock per share. The deal is contingent on Warner Bros. Discovery completing the previously announced separation of Discovery Global into a standalone company in the third quarter of 2026, as well as regulatory approval. The transaction is expected to take 12 to 18 months to complete.
Reports in October claimed that Apple was interested in acquiring Warner Bros. Discovery's extensive back catalog of content for Apple TV. With that prospect now firmly ruled out, ‌Apple TV‌ is highly likely to face heightened competition from Netflix in the years to come.

11,2025-12-05,"Programming note: Bits about Money is supported by our readers. I generally forecast about one issue a month, and haven't kept that pace that this year. As a result, I'm working on about 3-4 for December.
Much financial innovation is in the ultimate service of the real economy. Then, we have our friends in crypto, who occasionally do intellectually interesting things which do not have a locus in the real economy. One of those things is perpetual futures (hereafter, perps), which I find fascinating and worthy of study, the same way that a virologist just loves geeking out about furin cleavage sites.
You may have read a lot about stablecoins recently. I may write about them (again; see past BAM issue) in the future, as there has in recent years been some uptake of them for payments. But it is useful to understand that a plurality of stablecoins collateralize perps. Some observers are occasionally strategic in whether they acknowledge this, but for payments use cases, it does not require a lot of stock to facilitate massive flows. And so of the $300 billion or so in stablecoins presently outstanding, about a quarter sit on exchanges. The majority of that is collateralizing perp positions.
Perps are the dominant way crypto trades, in terms of volume. (It bounces around but is typically 6-8 times larger than spot.) This is similar to most traditional markets: where derivatives are available, derivative volume swamps spot volume. The degree to which depends on the market, Schelling points, user culture, and similar. For example, in India, most retail investing in equity is actually through derivatives; this is not true of the U.S. In the U.S., most retail equity exposure is through the spot market, directly holding stocks or indirectly through ETFs or mutual funds. Most trading volume of the stock indexes, however, is via derivatives. 
The large crypto exchanges are primarily casinos, who use the crypto markets as a source of numbers, in the same way a traditional casino might use a roulette wheel or set of dice. The function of a casino is for a patron to enter it with money and, statistically speaking, exit it with less. Physical casinos are often huge capital investments with large ongoing costs, including the return on that speculative capital. If they could choose to be less capital intensive, they would do so, but they are partially constrained by market forces and partially by regulation.
A crypto exchange is also capital intensive, not because the website or API took much investment (relatively low, by the standards of financial software) and not because they have a physical plant, but because trust is expensive. Bettors, and the more sophisticated market makers, who are the primary source of action for bettors, need to trust that the casino will actually be able to pay out winnings. That means the casino needs to keep assets (generally, mostly crypto, but including a smattering of cash for those casinos which are anomalously well-regarded by the financial industry) on hand exceeding customer account balances.
Those assets are… sitting there, doing nothing productive. And there is an implicit cost of capital associated with them, whether nominal (and borne by a gambler) or material (and borne by a sophisticated market making firm, crypto exchange, or the crypto exchange’s affiliate which trades against customers [0]).
Perpetual futures exist to provide the risk gamblers seek while decreasing the total capital requirement (shared by the exchange and market makers) to profitably run the enterprise.
In the commodities futures markets, you can contract to either buy or sell some standardized, valuable thing at a defined time in the future. The overwhelming majority of contracts do not result in taking delivery; they’re cancelled by an offsetting contract before that specified date.
Given that speculation and hedging are such core use cases for futures, the financial industry introduced a refinement: cash-settled futures. Now there is a reference price for the valuable thing, with a great deal of intellectual effort put into making that reference price robust and fair (not always successfully). Instead of someone notionally taking physical delivery of pork bellies or barrels of oil, people who are net short the future pay people who are net long the future on delivery day. (The mechanisms of this clearing are fascinating but outside today’s scope.)
Back in the early nineties economist Robert Shiller proposed a refinement to cash settled futures: if you don’t actually want pork bellies or oil barrels for consumption in April, and we accept that almost no futures participants actually do, why bother closing out the contracts in April? Why fragment the liquidity for contracts between April, May, June, etc? Just keep the market going perpetually.
This achieved its first widespread popular use in crypto (Bitmex is generally credited as being the popularizer), and hereafter we’ll describe the standard crypto implementation. There are, of course, variations available.
Instead of all of a particular futures vintage settling on the same day, perps settle multiple times a day for a particular market on a particular exchange. The mechanism for this is the funding rate. At a high level: winners get paid by losers every e.g. 4 hours and then the game continues, unless you’ve been blown out due to becoming overleveraged or for other reasons (discussed in a moment).
Consider a toy example: a retail user buys 0.1 Bitcoin via a perp. The price on their screen, which they understand to be for Bitcoin, might be $86,000 each, and so they might pay $8,600 cash. Should the price rise to $90,000 before the next settlement, they will get +/- $400 of winnings credited to their account, and their account will continue to reflect exposure to 0.1 units of Bitcoin via the perp. They might choose to sell their future at this point (or any other). They’ll have paid one commission (and a spread) to buy, one (of each) to sell, and perhaps they’ll leave the casino with their winnings, or perhaps they’ll play another game.
Where did the money come from? Someone else was symmetrically short exposure to Bitcoin via a perp. It is, with some very important caveats incoming, a closed system: since no good or service is being produced except the speculation, winning money means someone else lost.
One fun wrinkle for funding rates: some exchanges cap the amount the rate can be for a single settlement period. This is similar in intent to traditional markets’ usage of circuit breakers: designed to automatically blunt out-of-control feedback loops. It is dissimilar in that it cannot actually break circuits: changes to funding rate can delay realization of losses but can’t prevent them, since they don’t prevent the realization of symmetrical gains.
Perp funding rates also embed an interest rate component. This might get quoted as 3 bps a day, or 1 bps every eight hours, or similar. However, because of the impact of leverage, gamblers are paying more than you might expect: at 10X leverage that’s 30 bps a day. Consumer finance legislation standardizes borrowing costs as APR rather than basis points per day so that an unscrupulous lender can’t bury a 200% APR in the fine print.
Prices for perps do not, as a fact of nature, exactly match the underlying. That is a feature for some users.
In general, when the market is exuberant, the perp will trade above spot (the underlying market). To close the gap, a sophisticated market participant should do the basis trade: make offsetting trades in perps and spot (short the perp and buy spot, here, in equal size). Because the funding rate is set against a reference price for the underlying, longs will be paying shorts more (as a percentage of the perp’s current market price). For some of them, that’s fine: the price of gambling went up, oh well. For others, that’s a market incentive to close out the long position, which involves selling it, which will decrease the price at the margin (in the direction of spot).
The market maker can wait for price convergence; if it happens, they can close the trade at a profit, while having been paid to maintain the trade. If the perp continues to trade rich, they can just continue getting the increased funding cost. To the extent this is higher than their own cost of capital, this can be extremely lucrative.
Flip the polarities of these to understand the other direction.
The basis trade, classically executed, is delta neutral: one isn’t exposed to the underlying itself. You don’t need any belief in Bitcoin’s future adoption story, fundamentals, market sentiment, halvings, none of that. You’re getting paid to provide the gambling environment, including a really important feature: the perp price needs to stay reasonably close to the spot price, close enough to continue attracting people who want to gamble. You are also renting access to your capital for leverage.
You are also underwriting the exchange: if they blow up, your collateral becoming a claim against the bankruptcy estate is the happy scenario. (As one motivating example: Galois Capital, a crypto hedge fund doing basis trades, had ~40% of its assets on FTX when it went down. They then wound down the fund, selling the bankruptcy claim for 16 cents on the dollar.)
Recall that the market can’t function without a system of trust saying that someone is good for it if a bettor wins. Here, the market maker is good for it, via the collateral it kept on the exchange.
Many market makers function across many different crypto exchanges. This is one reason they’re so interested in capital efficiency: fully collateralizing all potential positions they could take across the universe of venues they trade on would be prohibitively capital intensive, and if they do not pre-deploy capital, they miss profitable trading opportunities. [1]
Gamblers like risk; it amps up the fun. Since one has many casinos to choose from in crypto, the ones which only “regular” exposure to Bitcoin (via spot or perps) would be offering a less-fun product for many users than the ones which offer leverage. How much leverage? More leverage is always the answer to that question, until predictable consequences start happening.
In a standard U.S. brokerage account, Regulation T has, for almost 100 years now, set maximum leverage limits (by setting minimums for margins). These are 2X at position opening time and 4X “maintenance” (before one closes out the position). Your brokerage would be obligated to forcibly close your position if volatility causes you to exceed those limits.
As a simplified example, if you have $50k of cash, you’d be allowed to buy $100k of stock. You now have $50k of equity and a $50k loan: 2x leverage. Should the value of that stock decline to about $67k, you still owe the $50k loan, and so only have $17k remaining equity. You’re now on the precipice of being 4X leveraged, and should expect a margin call very soon, if your broker hasn’t “blown you out of the trade” already.
What part of that is relevant to crypto? For the moment, just focus on that number: 4X.
Perps are offered at 1X (non-levered exposure). But they’re routinely offered at 20X, 50X, and 100X. SBF, during his press tour / regulatory blitz about being a responsible financial magnate fleecing the customers in an orderly fashion, voluntarily self-limited FTX to 20X.
One reason perps are structurally better for exchanges and market makers is that they simplify the business of blowing out leveraged traders. The exact mechanics depend on the exchange, the amount, etc, but generally speaking you can either force the customer to enter a closing trade or you can assign their position to someone willing to bear the risk in return for a discount.
Blowing out losing traders is lucrative for exchanges except when it catastrophically isn’t. It is a priced service in many places. The price is quoted to be low (“a nominal fee of 0.5%” is one way Binance describes it) but, since it is calculated from the amount at risk, it can be a large portion of the money lost. If the account’s negative balance is less than the liquidation fee, wonderful, thanks for playing and the exchange / “the insurance fund” keeps the rest, as a tip.
In the case where the amount an account is negative by is more than the fee, that “insurance fund” can choose to pay the winners on behalf of the liquidated user, at management’s discretion. Management will usually decide to do this, because a casino with a reputation for not paying winners will not long remain a casino.
But tail risk is a real thing. The capital efficiency has a price: there physically does not exist enough money in the system to pay all winners given sufficiently dramatic price moves. Forced liquidations happen. Sophisticated participants withdraw liquidity (for reasons we’ll soon discuss) or the exchange becomes overwhelmed technically / operationally. The forced liquidations eat through the diminished / unreplenished liquidity in the book, and the magnitude of the move increases.
Then crypto gets reminded about automatic deleveraging (ADL), a detail to perp contracts that few participants understand.
(Pray we do not alter them further.)
Risk in perps has to be symmetric: if (accounting for leverage) there are 100,000 units of Somecoin exposure long, then there are 100,000 units of Somecoin exposure short. This does not imply that the shorts or longs are sufficiently capitalized to actually pay for all the exposure in all instances.
In cases where management deems paying winners from the insurance fund would be too costly and/or impossible, they automatically deleverage some winners. In theory, there is a published process for doing this, because it would be confidence-costing to ADL non-affiliated accounts but pay out affiliated accounts, one’s friends or particularly important counterparties, etc. In theory.
In theory, one likely ADLs accounts which were quite levered before ones which were less levered, and one ADLs accounts which had high profits before ones with lower profits. In theory. [2]
So perhaps you understood, prior to a 20% move, that you were 4X leveraged. You just earned 80%, right? Ah, except you were only 2X leveraged, so you earned 40%. Why were you retroactively only 2X? That’s what automatic deleveraging means. Why couldn’t you get the other 40% you feel entitled to? Because the collective group of losers doesn’t have enough to pay you your winnings and the insurance fund was insufficient or deemed insufficient by management.
ADL is particularly painful for sophisticated market participants doing e.g. a basis trade, because they thought e.g. they were 100 units short via perps and 100 units long somewhere else via spot. If it turns out they were actually 50 units short via perps, but 100 units long, their net exposure is +50 units, and they have very possibly just gotten absolutely shellacked.
In theory, this can happen to the upside or the downside. In practice in crypto, this seems to usually happen after sharp decreases in prices, not sharp increases. For example, October 2025 saw widespread ADLing as (more than) $19 billion of liquidations happened, across a variety of assets. Alameda’s CEO Caroline Ellison testified that they lost over $100 million during the collapse of Terra’s stablecoin in 2022, but since FTX’s insurance fund was made up; when leveraged traders lost money, their positions were frequently taken up by Alameda. That was quite lucrative much of the time, but catastrophically expensive during e.g. the Terra blowup. Alameda was a good loser and paid the winners, though: with other customers’ assets that they “borrowed.”
In the traditional markets, if one’s brokerage deems one’s assets are unlikely to be able to cover the margin loan from the brokerage one has used, one’s brokerage will issue a margin call. Historically that gave one a relatively short period (typically, a few days) to post additional collateral, either by moving in cash, by transferring assets from another brokerage, or by experiencing appreciation in the value of one’s assets. Brokerages have the option, and in some cases the requirement, to manage risk after or during a margin call by forcing trades on behalf of the customer to close positions.
It sometimes surprises crypto natives that, in the case where one’s brokerage account goes negative and all assets are sold, with a negative remaining balance, the traditional markets largely still expect you to pay that balance. This contrasts with crypto, where the market expectation for many years was that the customer was Daffy Duck with a gmail address and a pseudonymous set of numbered accounts recorded on a blockchain, and dunning them was a waste of time. Crypto exchanges have mostly, in the intervening years, either stepped up their game regarding KYC or pretended to do so, but the market expectation is still that a defaulting user will basically never successfully recover. (Note that the legal obligation to pay is not coextensive with users actually paying. The retail speculators with $25,000 of capital that the pattern day trade rules are worried about will often not have $5,000 to cover a deficiency. On the other end of the scale, when a hedge fund blows up, the fund entity is wiped out, but its limited partners—pension funds, endowments, family offices—are not on the hook to the prime broker, and nobody expects the general partner to start selling their house to make up the difference.) 
So who bears the loss when the customer doesn’t, can’t, or won’t? The waterfall depends on market, product type, and geography, but as a sketch: brokerages bear the loss first, out of their own capital. They’re generally required to keep a reserve for this purpose. 
A brokerage will, in the ordinary course of business, have obligations to other parties which would be endangered if they were catastrophically mismanaged and could not successfully manage risk during a downturn. (It’s been known to happen, and even can be associated with assets rather than liabilities.) In this case, most of those counterparties are partially insulated by structures designed to insure the peer group. These include e.g. clearing pools, guaranty funds capitalized by the member firms of a clearinghouse, the clearinghouse’s own capital, and perhaps mutualized insurance pools. That is the rough ordering of the waterfall, which varies depending geography/product/market.
One can imagine a true catastrophe which burns through each of those layers of protection, and in that case, the clearinghouse might be forced to assess members or allocate losses across survivors. That would be a very, very bad day, but contracts exist to be followed on very bad days.
One commonality with crypto, though: this system is also not fully capitalized against all possible events at all times. Unlike crypto, which for contingent reasons pays some lip service to being averse to credit even as it embraces leveraged trading, the traditional industry relies extensively on underwriting risk of various participants.
Many crypto advocates believe that they have something which the traditional finance industry desperately needs. Perps are crypto’s most popular and lucrative product, but they probably won’t be adopted materially in traditional markets.
Existing derivatives products already work reasonably well at solving the cost of capital issue. Liquidations are not the business model of traditional brokerages. And learning, on a day when markets are 20% down, that you might be hedged or you might be bankrupt, is not a prospect which fills traditional finance professionals with the warm fuzzies.
And now you understand the crypto markets a bit better.
[0] Brokers trading with their own customers can happen in the ordinary course of business, but has been progressively discouraged in traditional finance, as it enables frontrunning. 
Frontrunning, while it is understood in the popular parlance to mean “trading before someone else can trade” and often brought up in discussions of high frequency trading using very fast computers, does not historically mean that. It historically describes a single abusive practice: a broker could basically use the slowness of traditional financial IT systems to give conditional post-facto treatment to customer orders, taking the other side of them (if profitable) or not (if not). Frontrunning basically disappeared because customers now get order confirms almost instantly by computer not at end of day via a phone call. The confirm has the price the trade executed at on it. 
In classic frontrunning, you sent the customer’s order to the market (at some price X), waited a bit, and then observed a later price Y. If Y was worse for the customer than X, well, them’s the breaks on Wall Street. If Y was better, you congratulated the customer on their investing acumen, and informed them that they had successfully transacted at Z, a price of your choosing between X and Y. You then fraudulently inserted a recorded transaction between the customer and yourself earlier in the day, at price Z, and assigned the transaction which happened at X to your own account, not to the customer’s account.
Frontrunning was a lucrative scam while it lasted, because (effectively) the customer takes 100% of the risk of the trade but the broker gets any percentage they want of the first day’s profits. This is potentially so lucrative that smart money (and some investors in his funds!) thought Madoff was doing it, thus generating the better-than-market stable returns for over a decade through malfeasance. Of frontrunning Madoff was entirely innocent.
Some more principled crypto participants have attempted to discourage exchanges from trading with their own customers. They have mostly been unsuccessful: Merit Peak Limited is Binance’s captive entity which does this. It also is occasionally described by U.S. federal agencies as running a sideline in money laundering, Alameda Research was FTX’s affiliated trading fund. Their management was criminally convicted of money laundering. etc, etc.
One of the reasons this behavior is so adaptive is because the billions of dollars sloshing around can be described to banks as “proprietary trading” and “running an OTC desk”, and an inattentive bank (like, say, Silvergate, as recounted here) might miss the customer fund flows they would have been formally unwilling to facilitate. This is a useful feature for sophisticated crypto participants, and so some of them do not draw attention to the elephant in the room, even though it is averse to their interests.
[1] Not all crypto trades are pre-funded. Crypto OTC transactions sometimes settle on T+1, with the OTC desk essentially extending credit in the fashion that a prime broker would in traditional markets. But most transactions on exchanges have to be paid immediately in cash already at the venue. This is very different from traditional equity market structure, where venues don’t typically receive funds flow at all, and settling/clearing happens after the fact, generally by a day or two.
[2] I note, for the benefit of readers of footnote 0, that there is often a substantial gap between the time when market dislocation happens and when a trader is informed they were ADLed. The implications of this are left as an exercise to the reader.

Despite the fact that Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff talks about AI nonstop, regularly chimes in on the AI news of the day, and endlessly pushes his company’s AI platform, he seems worried that people just aren’t associating Salesforce with AI. Luckily, he has a solution in mind, according to a report from Business Insider: changing the company’s entire name to Agentforce to evoke the AI agents that he’d like the company to be known for.
While the suggestion of changing the company’s name was apparently raised in jest, Benioff took it seriously and told the publication that a new corporate name might be in the works. “That would not shock me,” he reportedly said, with an apparent preference for the name Agentforceâcurrently the name used by a number of the company’s AI-related services, including Agentforce Sales, Agentforce Service, and Agentforce 365 Platform.
On one hand, Salesforce Agentforce Sales is pretty redundant, so there’s some logic in simplifying the naming convention. On the other hand, it’s hard not to get a whiff of the cryptocurrency goldrush era, where companies just started throwing the word “blockchain” into everything. Remember when Long Island Iced Tea Corporation changed its name to Long Blockchain Corporation, a name that doesn’t even make sense, and saw its stock immediately skyrocket by over 400%? It feels like we’re not that far off from a situation similar to that.
Salesforce, of course, would not be the first tech company to go through a rebrand. Google famously became Alphabet, Jack Dorsey’s Square changed to Block, Elon Musk renamed Twitter to X, and Michael Saylor changed Microstrategy’s moniker to Strategy as it became a bitcoin holding company. Notably, at least two of those are changes most people simply don’t acknowledge.
But perhaps the most appropriate parallel for this particular change is Facebook rebranding to Meta in the midst of an effort to pivot the company into a new era where it would become the platform of the metaverse, an immersive virtual reality world where just about anything you could imagine is possible, including having legs. The dream of that particular reality is largely dead now, with Meta reportedlyÂ that it’ll likely have layoffs within its Reality Labs division and will shift away from the virtual world to build more AI products. And yet, the name sticks.
That might be a fate Benioff should consider: if you go so far all-in on a single bet that you surrender your name to it, you might just be stuck with a reminder of that decision even if it fails.

Is your Christmas tree missing a little bling? Itâs time to add some smart lighting to brighten it up. Govee makes some of our favorite solutions out there, and we just spotted its smart RGBIC Christmas tree lights going for less at Amazon.
On a regular day, these lights would run you around $140, but the retailer just slashed the price by 36%, offering them for just $90 right now. Itâs the lowest we have seen them drop to in a long while. It was also originally a Black Friday discount, which managed to survive the main event. Youâll enjoy free delivery on your purchase, which ultimately brings the total down even further. Snap it up quickly, though. Christmas is just around the corner, and weâre expecting these lights to be a popular pick, so both the discount and the stock could run out soon.
See at Amazon
The box includes 24 string lights, with a total of 480 LED beads. Each line is 6.6ft long and features 20 LEDs, making it great for most trees from 6.5ft to 8ft. Thereâs an 11.5ft power line attached, which allows you to place the lights anywhere without feeling limited. Installation couldnât be simpler. The lights come with everything you need to put these up, including mounting rings, bar support, cable ties, and U-shaped straps.
Once up, the upgraded LED design, paired with the densely arranged beads, makes for a much smoother, uniform lighting effect. You can choose from 16 million color options (you read that right), plus over 60 versatile preset modes that have something appropriate for every occasion. If you already have a vision in mind, go DIY using the dedicated app, picking your own colors and styles. You can overlap layers, draw a sketch on the app to get specific patterns on the lights, edit patterns, or share your ideas with the AI bot to create unique effects. Donât have the time for all of that? The preset modes make it easy to choose one within seconds. The Christmas lighting show, for instance, is bright and offers a nice mix of holiday-appropriate colors. Similarly, the âNew Yearâsâ mode is a bit more vibrant, while the âWinter Warmâ option brings cozy energy into your space.
The timer section in the app lets you create specific schedules for your lights. Thereâs a Sleep option to dim them, and a Wake Up to turn them on gradually. Whatâs more, the lights can also turn on when you clap your hands. Turn it into a game and see who can light them all up in the shortest time!
Thereâs a lot more to like about these smart lights that can be used for multiple events. You can pick from a range of colors and preset modes, which means youâre no longer stuck with the basic yellow lighting. Maybe go for something bright during the day, and switch to warmer tones at night; the possibilities are endless. Amazon is now letting you grab them for just $90, after taking a whopping 36% off their retail price. Make sure you act fast to grab them, because weâre not expecting the discount or the stock to last long. That said, there are plenty of other lighting solutions by Govee going for less, as well. Now is a great time to stock up on everything youâve had your eyes on, before the prices shoot back up.

Every PC is going to get more expensive in the coming monthsâboth stationary and mobile machines. Folk who were planning to build their own computer are screwed out of an affordable PC thanks to the ballooning price of RAM. However, anybody who was thinking of buying a prebuilt laptop should do it sooner rather than later. There are growing signs some of the largest laptop makers are planning to raise prices sooner than later.
Market analysis firm TrendForce reported Friday that most of the largest laptop manufacturers are consideringâif not already planningânew price hikes. Lenovo, the company that still commands the largest market share in PCs, is reportedly warning customers (by that, we mean retailers) that current prices will expire come Jan. 1, 2026, according to a notice seen by industry sources. That means retailers should expect to see a new suggested retail price, which will eventually force consumers to fork over even more for their desktops and laptops.
ð Memory crunch alert! #Dell reportedly to hike prices 15-20% as soon as mid-Dec, #Lenovo follows in early 2026. Time to lock in orders.ð¡More: https://t.co/osuy2oPhNt ð pic.twitter.com/m7MTczLitl
— NEWS (@NEWS2082680) December 5, 2025

Gizmodo asked Lenovo for confirmation of its plans, but the company did not respond to a request for comment before press time. All companies are dealing with the same issue. Memory prices have increased at a relentless pace over the past two months due to a growing shortage of DRAM (dynamic random access memory) and NAND, which is used for flash storage. Major semiconductor companies, such as Samsung and SK Hynix, have listened to the siren call of AI data centers and have refocused their industries, creating memory for ongoing projects like OpenAIâs multi-state Stargate project. AI memory is proving far more lucrative for companies, so much so that major memory supplier Micron ended its Crucial consumer-end brand to put all its focus on supplying data centers.
HP, the second-largest PC supplier by market share, is in similarly dire straits. Korean newspaper Chosun Ibo reported earlier this week that both HP and Dell are re-examining their product roadmaps just weeks before theyâre expected to unveil their new products at CES 2026. HPâs CEO Enrique Lores has suggested memory makes up for around 15 to 20% of a PCâs cost. Thatâs only exacerbated by the refocus on AI in PCs, like with Microsoftâs Copilot+ designation. These PCs need more RAM to facilitate on-device AI of any kindânormally at least 16GB if not more. If you were wondering why Apple is now providing at least 16GB on all base MacBook models, now you know why.
TrendForceâs anonymous industry sources suggested Dell would raise prices by around that same 15 to 20% as soon as mid-December. Dellâs brand encompasses its lineup of consumer- and business-focused laptops as well as gaming products through its Alienware brand. The company is not ruling out any price hikes, though to what extent is the remaining question.
In an email statement, Dell told Gizmodo:
Like others in the industry, Dell takes targeted pricing action, when necessary, while maintaining supply continuity and its commitment to customer value. Our supply chain is resilient and globally diverse. Itâs designed to offer the needed flexibility when navigating macroeconomic, regulatory, and trade dynamics.
Representatives from Lenovo and HP didnât respond to a request for comment. Weâll update this piece if we hear more.
This trend of price increases will inevitably hurt the smallest brands worse. OneXPlayer, the maker of boutique gaming handhelds and PCs, told customers it had halted any new orders of its big, expensive Apex gaming handheld. It said âcurrent stock is fully allocatedâ for pre-sale customers. It now has to âconfirm new pricing with our memory and SSD suppliers.â You can guess that if that PC is already expensive, it will cost even more going forward.

Bitcoin treasury companies are bleeding as Bitcoin’s price flutters around $89,000.
Metaplanet, one of the largest Bitcoin treasury companies after Strategy, has swung from over $600 million in unrealised profits in early October to around $530 million in unrealised losses as of December 1, according to data from Galaxy Research.
The collapse mirrors Bitcoin’s 25% price drop from its October highs. With Bitcoin trading around $89,000, treasury companies that accumulated aggressively near the peak are now deeply underwater. 
Touted as the next wave of corporate finance, the digital asset treasury model is breaking apart. Companies that raised capital to buy Bitcoin over $100,000 — thinking the asset would never drop below six-figures — are now sitting on massive unrealised losses while their equity premiums have simultaneously evaporated.
Shares for these companies have also plunged in value. Already in September, many treasuries were watching their stock prices lose value, sometimes at a faster pace than Bitcoin. 
Metaplanet, the hotel operator turned Bitcoin treasury, has an average cost that sits at around $108,000 per Bitcoin. With Bitcoin at $89,000, the company is underwater by nearly $17,000 per coin across its 30,823 Bitcoin balance sheet.
Nakamoto has been hit particularly hard. Not only does the company hold 5,398 Bitcoin at an average cost of around $118,000 — that puts the company’s unrealised losses at over $180 million — but it has also watched its share prices collapse more than 95%. 
And then there’s Semler Scientific, which holds 5,048 Bitcoin at an average cost of about $95,000, leaving it with over $50 million in unrealised losses.
Only Strategy remains profitable, holding 650,000 Bitcoin at a $74,436 average cost. But even Strategy’s unrealised gains have collapsed from $28.4 billion in July to $6.9 billion today.
But that’s not all, for equity premiums tell an even uglier story.
In July, when Bitcoin traded near $118,000, treasury companies commanded massive premiums to their Bitcoin holdings. Metaplanet traded at 237% of its Bitcoin market-to-net-asset value, while Strategy traded at a 79% premium. 
Today, those premiums have vanished or inverted entirely.
Strategy now trades at a 15.5% discount to its Bitcoin NAV — the first time the company has traded below the value of its holdings since transforming from a software provider into a treasury company.
Metaplanet’s premium collapsed to just 6% from 237%, while Scientific trades at a 29% discount, and Nakamoto has a discount of over 50%. 
The compression also reflects a complete loss of confidence in the treasury model. 
When Bitcoin was rallying, investors paid premiums betting these companies would continue accumulating and Bitcoin would continue to appreciate. Now that Bitcoin has fallen and these companies are underwater, investors are pricing in distress.
Moreover, treasuries have also slowed down their shopping sprees. In November, the amount of Bitcoin bought by these companies dropped to its lowest level this year, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net.

21,2025-12-05,"Netflix is taking a massive swing at the future of entertainment, and Hollywood will never be the same.
The streaming giant has agreed to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's studio and streaming businesses for an equity value of $72 billion, the companies said on Friday. It's by far Netflix's biggest acquisition in its history and is one of the largest ever in the entertainment industry.
""Warner Bros. has helped define the last century of entertainment, and together, we can help define the next one,"" Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos on a call after the deal's announcement.
The seismic cash-and-stock deal, which has a total enterprise value of $82.7 billion, will bring together Netflix's streaming platform with Warner Bros.' century-old studio, HBO, HBO Max, and some of the most iconic franchises in film and television.
The acquisition is expected to close after WBD spins off its Global Networks division into a separate publicly traded company, Discovery Global, which includes WBD's TV networks like CNN, TNT, and TBS. The process is expected to take 12 to 18 months, the companies said.
Netflix investors don't seem thrilled with the deal, as its stock slid 3.9% in premarket trading on the news. WBD shares surged 3.3%.
Shares of rival bidders Paramount also retreated by 2.9%, while fellow suitor Comcast's stock was little changed.
Sarandos said the merger strengthens the company's core mission.
He called Warner Bros.' catalog ""incredible"" and said that bringing together classics such as ""Citizen Kane"" with Netflix hits like ""Stranger Things,"" ""KPop Demon Hunters,"" and ""Squid Game"" would allow the company to entertain the world ""even better.""
Sarandos said this merger would let Netflix give audiences ""more of what they love"" while helping shape the next century of global storytelling.
Netflix plans to preserve Warner Bros.' existing operations, including its theatrical release pipeline.
Several WBD employees said they were on edge about a Netflix acquisition.
One longtime HBO software engineer said they were worried about their job if the Netflix acquisition went through. Their reasoning was that Netflix already has a top-notch tech platform, so they might not keep many software engineers if the tech giant came out on top and collapsed HBO Max's platform into its own.
Another WBD streaming employee expressed a similar concern about Netflix and their personal job security.
A third WBD streaming employee had a very different take, saying he was rooting for Netflix to win.
""I think Netflix is cooler and more hip than Comcast and Paramount,"" this person said. They said they weren't too concerned about their job security with a deal, adding that in past transactions involving WBD's assets, reorgs took a long time to come to fruition.
Warner Bros. grants Netflix access to some of the most recognizable titles in modern entertainment, including enduring sitcoms like ""Friends"" and ""The Big Bang Theory,"" as well as prestige television from HBO, franchises like ""Harry Potter,"" and classic movies like ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Casablanca.""
While Netflix built its empire on original programming, it has long lacked the kind of heritage intellectual property that more established studios, such as Disney, have.
If regulators approve the deal, Netflix subscribers are likely to get a wider selection of premium content on the platform.
Netflix expects the acquisition to deliver $2 billion to $3 billion in annual cost savings by the third year and to boost earnings by the second year.
WBD shareholders will receive $23.25 in cash per share and $4.50 in Netflix stock, Netflix said. The agreement values WBD at $27.75 per share.
Regulators are expected to scrutinize the deal closely. It still requires approval from the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, and WBD shareholders.
Netflix's victory is a surprise for many media industry insiders and a loss for David Ellison's Paramount Skydance.
Netflix already has the largest paid streaming service by both subscribers and engagement, so the consensus among media analysts was that it didn't necessarily need HBO Max and its content.
Paramount was the first bidder for WBD and the only suitor willing to swallow the whole company. Many industry insiders thought Ellison's apparent rapport with Trump could help a Paramount-WBD deal get a headache-free approval process.
Comcast was also in the mix. Rich Greenfield of LightShed Partners made the case that Comcast should go all out to buy WBD's studio and streamer, writing that it was time for the company ""to make a bold move to change the narrative around Comcast."" Without HBO Max, Greenfield said its Peacock streamer would be ""stranded without an obvious merger partner and at a meaningful content deficit.""
Instead, Netflix appears poised to acquire HBO Max and its large subscriber base. Meanwhile, Paramount+ and Peacock could fall further behind.

	Netflix secured $59 billion in debt financing for acquisition

								By 

	Todd Spangler

NY Digital Editor

UDPATED: Netflix’s stock was up and down in trading Friday after the company announced a debt-fueled deal to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery’s studios and HBO Max streamer — while investors pushed WBD stock to its highest levels in more than three years.

	Shares of Netflix, after opening the session down 4%, rebounded through the morning into positive territory before dropping back down to close Friday down 2.9%, to $100.24/share. WBD stock ended the day up 6.3% to $26.09/share — the highest its stock price has been since closing at $26/share on April 13, 2022, in the days after Discovery Communications completed its WarnerMedia acquisition.

	Meanwhile, the stock price of Paramount Skydance — which had been aggressively bidding to acquire WBD in its entirety — fell 9.8% Friday on the Netflix-WB deal news.




			Popular on Variety		






	Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery announced the deal Friday before the market opened. The deal carries an equity value of $72 billion and an enterprise value of (including debt) of $82.7 billion, the companies said. WBD shareholders will receive $27.75/share in cash and stock in Netflix under the pact.

	In an SEC filing, Netflix said it secured $59 billion in debt financing from Wells Fargo, BNP Paribas and HSBC to fund the deal.

	Netflix execs told Wall Street analysts on a call that they jumped on the rare opportunity to buy Warner Bros., which has a huge film and TV library, significant production capabilities, along with the HBO Max streaming service. While Netflix didn’t need to acquire WB to continue on its growth trajectory, co-CEO Ted Sarandos said, the combination will accelerate both Netflix and Warner Bros. businesses.

	










	“This is a rare opportunity that’s going to help us achieve our mission to entertain the world and to bring people together through great stories,” Sarandos said on the call.

	Netflix said it expects to see $2 billion-$3 billion in cost savings annually by the third year after the WB deal closes. The company expects the transaction to be accretive to earnings per share by year two.

	Netflix said it plans to maintain Warner Bros.’ current operations, including continuing to release WB films in theaters. Currently, Warner Bros. has deals to release its film in cinemas through 2029. Netflix also signaled it would keep HBO Max as a discrete service, at least in the near term.

	That said, Sarandos told analysts he believes release windows for Warner Bros. movies in theaters will become “much more consumer friendly.”

	“I wouldn’t look at this as a change in approach for Netflix movies or for Warner movies,” Sarandos said. “I think, over time, the windows will evolve to be much more consumer friendly, to be able to meet the audience where they are quicker.” He added that “our primary goal is to bring first-run movies to our members, because that’s what they’re looking for.”

	The companies said they expect Netflix’s deal with WBD to close in 12-18 months, following WBD’s already planned split into two entities — Warner Bros. studios and streaming and Discovery Global, largely comprising its TV networks — by the third quarter of 2026.

The Business of Entertainment"
24,2025-12-05,The money maven is a big proponent of this particular retirement savings vehicle.
25,2025-12-05,"I'm a registered dietitian feeding my family of four — including one teenage boy with an appetite for two — on a budget, so balancing nutrition and cost is my priority.
Before I became a dietitian, I was a frugal shopper who relied on store brands and sales that kept my family below our target budget.
When an Aldi opened nearby, I didn't expect switching stores to drastically impact our savings, nor was I convinced that its product quality could match that of other store brands.
It turns out I was wrong on both accounts. And once I began bargain shopping for organic milk to give my toddler, I became a true Aldi enthusiast.
Now, I visit the discount grocer weekly for nutrient-dense staples, such as fish, nuts, frozen fruits, and vegetables that help stretch our grocery bill even further.
I buy two dozen eggs every time I'm at Aldi since they cost much less here than at the other stores near me.
My family uses eggs for breakfasts like omelettes, waffles, and pancakes, and we also hard-boil them for an on-the-go snack (each one has over 6 grams of protein).
I like to stock up on raw nuts, like walnuts and pecans, since I can use them in so many different recipes that I know my family won't waste them.
For example, roasted pecans with maple syrup and rosemary are a delicious snack. I also add nuts to Greek yogurt, overnight oats, banana bread, and various desserts.
I keep walnuts, which are packed with heart-healthy fats, in the pantry or the freezer when I want to store them for a long period of time.
I always grab a 32-ounce tub of Aldi's Friendly Farms plain nonfat Greek yogurt with no added sugar. 
Greek yogurt contains probiotics, also known as ""good bacteria,"" which offer a range of health benefits. It's also a decent source of protein — this variety has 16 grams of protein per serving.
I eat it for breakfast often and add chia seeds, walnuts, and blueberries for extra flavor and nutrients. 
Greek yogurt is also great to have on hand for substitutions in recipes calling for sour cream or mayonnaise.
I like that Aldi's Specially Selected sourdough is made with only a few ingredients.
This bread has the natural tang of traditional sourdough even though it contains commercial yeast, which isn't an ingredient in authentic sourdough made with only water, flour, and salt.
However, I buy this loaf for its flavor and texture, as it works well with tuna melts, avocado toast, or fried eggs sprinkled with Trader Joe's Everything but the Bagel Sesame Seasoning Blend.
Olives are a low-carbohydrate staple filled with healthy fats and fiber.
Instead of relying on cheese and processed ingredients to flavor salads and grain bowls, Kalamata olives add a delicious briny taste.
For parties, I use olives to make homemade tapenades, which are a great addition to cheeseboards.
Frozen berries, which are packed with antioxidants, are one of Aldi's best bargains. The cherry and berry medleys are great in smoothies with almond milk and chia seeds.
I always buy frozen blueberries since we use them almost every morning in overnight oats, yogurt bowls, or muffins.
I often add canned tuna, a lean and inexpensive protein, to my cart. 
Northern Catch chunk-light tuna has 20 grams of protein per serving, and my son loves using it to make tuna melts.
The store's canned salmon is another staple for us. I throw it over salads when I don't have anything prepped for lunch. 
And if I want a seafood dinner that feels a bit more luxe, I grab Aldi's frozen tuna steaks to make sesame-crusted, pan-seared tuna.
I buy Aldi's old-fashioned and steel-cut oats to meal prep overnight oats for the week. Each serving of them has a nice dose of fiber, and I top them with nuts for even more protein.
My family also uses oats to make energy bars, granola, and toasted oats. We've even used them as a high-fiber binder in place of breadcrumbs in some recipes.
Aldi's produce section has my favorite salad ingredients — prewashed arugula, peppers, red onions, tomatoes, mushrooms, and radishes — at an affordable price.
I also stock up on zucchini, red peppers, and red onions to make a large batch of grilled or roasted vegetables at least once a week.
I can reheat them as side dishes or mix them with quinoa, arugula, chickpeas, feta, and hummus for a delicious and easy-to-prepare lunch.
I buy Aldi's jarred pesto because it tastes better than other brands I've tried, and it's less expensive than making it from scratch (plus, it's way easier).
I keep a few jars in the house at all times since I use the sauce to make one of my family's favorite quick meals: pasta with chicken or shrimp, broccoli, pesto, and grated Parmesan cheese.
About 2 ½ tablespoons of these tiny seeds provide about 10 grams of fiber, 5 grams of protein, and 8 grams of fat. They're also heart-healthy.
Since we only use about a tablespoon at a time on yogurt or in smoothies for the extra nutrient boost, I store them in the freezer to extend their shelf life.
After all, these high-fat seeds can spoil at room temperature.

Oh you sweet summer child. The internet had a business model the second it was accessible outside of ARPANET.
Also no. I'm not sure if you stole your dad's Slashdot account, but no the best internet ever created was not preserved in academic wonderland. The internet was far more useful in the early 2010s than at any time in the past and long after it was commercialised. Is it going downhill? Yep. But does that mean it was better in its infancy? Hell no. It was fucking useless back then. There's far more information available now than there ever was.
And 2010 coincides with the ascendency of the smartphone as the primary device most people use to access the internet. It's not the sole reason, but it does play a big part.
There's far more information available now than there ever was.You didn't have gopher?
The Internet was, and still is, more than http/https. But that's only for people who know their way around it. The rest of you are like the fat kid on a boy scout camp-out when the bear (Google) arrives. As long as you keep it fed, we'll be safe.

Agreed.  If someone wants a movie or music or software, they can request it from the owners and can only use the item they were specifically given permission to use.  Otherwise, they have to pay for it.
The search giant combined its search and AI crawler into one, meaning users who opt out of Google's AI crawler won't be indexed in Google search resultsI can think of another company which has a search engine and is also one of the ""big boys"" when it comes to AI.  Do Microsoft do their own AI crawling or is it sufficiently separated from Bing's that Cloudflare can tell them apart (so far).A second approach is that Google's search engine is their original business.  How tolerant would their user-base be if Cloudflare blocked their crawler, worldwide.  That war would hurt the sites depending on Google for their traffic, but it would also hurt Google as well.  The DOJ was already going after the company (not sure if that's still a ""thing"" under Trump) but their machinations take years anyway, as thegarbz points out [slashdot.org], the EU more likely to get involved and they sometimes move faster.

Were all of those really AI bots?What about all those times that I went to a web site, got a stupid captcha, said fuck it, and went to a different site?
One of the browsers I use cannot handle Cloudflare Capchas, I'm not sure if it's down to browser sniffing or some incompatibility, but at that point I either say fuck it or copy the link into another browser.
Does your browser advertise itself as a web crawler? But let's math this shit!
You are a human. I suspect when you browse it takes you a good 10-20 seconds to make a connection, wait, receive a captcha, re-evaluate and context switch, and attempt to switch to another website. That's conservatively 6 attempts per minute. I assume you need to eat, drink, shower, shit and sleep so let's say you spend every other moment constantly battling Cloudflare like a lunatic even professionally while you work. That's 16 h 
Aren't scraping requests. I keep getting blocked by cloudflare and it sucks, it happens probably 1 out of 50 sites on multiple machines. They still can't recognize between power users and AI.
That's great. You get all my competitors together to follow this standard with a minimal amount of opt-in data and I'll just keep hovering up the entire internet. You see why my competitors may not be so keen on your standard idea?

Alaska Airlines is making its most ambitious international expansion yet, announcing daily nonstop service from Seattle to London Heathrow beginning spring 2026 as the carrier transforms into a premium global airline following its acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines.
Alaska Airlines is accelerating its future as a premium global carrier, charting a bold new course across the Atlantic with the launch of nonstop routes to London Heathrow and Reykjavik, Iceland, from its growing global gateway in Seattle starting next spring.
London is the largest intercontinental market from Seattle, with more than 400 passengers traveling between the two vibrant cities every day, making it a strategic choice for Alaska’s transatlantic debut.
Alaska will offer daily, year-round service to the British capital on its widebody 787-9 aircraft, featuring 34 enclosed suites with fully lie-flat seats in Business Class. The route targets both corporate and leisure travelers seeking premium onboard amenities and expanded connectivity options.
CEO Ben Minicucci emphasized the significance of the expansion: “With these bold moves, we are accelerating our vision to connect our guests to the world. We are seizing this moment to redefine the international experience and level up”.
As a gateway to Europe, this daily flight will connect guests throughout the West Coast to London and other destinations served by Alaska’s extensive partner network, while also providing guests in the states of Alaska and Hawaii with conveniently timed connectivity to a highly desired market.
The London service will utilize Alaska’s growing Boeing 787-9 fleet, featuring a striking new global livery inspired by the aurora borealis. Alaska Air Group’s 2024 acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines provided the carrier with access to widebody aircraft for the first time, accelerating its long-haul expansion plans.
The carrier currently operates four 787-9s and will open a new pilot base in Seattle to support the aircraft type beginning in spring 2026. Alaska is debuting its striking global exterior design that will be featured on its growing fleet of up to 17 widebody 787 Dreamliner aircraft.
The Seattle-London market is currently served by British Airways, Delta Air Lines and Virgin Atlantic, with about 14,700 two-way weekly seats. Alaska’s entry will provide travelers with additional scheduling options and premium capacity.
Alaska’s expansion into the London market, facilitated by strengthened collaborations with American Airlines and British Airways, presents significant opportunities, with these alliances expected to deepen over time.
The London announcement represents part of a comprehensive international expansion strategy. The long-haul Dreamliner experience will be available when service begins between Seattle and Seoul-Incheon on September 12, and on the existing Seattle-Tokyo Narita route starting on January 7, 2026. Flights to Rome are scheduled to begin next spring.
The carrier plans to have at least 12 nonstop intercontinental flights from Seattle by 2030, establishing the Pacific Northwest hub as a major gateway for global travel.
Alongside London, Alaska also announced seasonal daily service to Reykjavik, Iceland. Alaska will fly the Reykjavik route with 737-8 MAX aircraft during the summer season when the days are long and bright in Iceland, serving adventure lovers and outdoor enthusiasts while providing a convenient gateway to the European continent.
International travel, especially for premium seats, has held up better than U.S. domestic demand, where the market is oversupplied, making Alaska’s timing strategic for entering long-haul markets.
The route offers an alternative to those seeking more flight times, greater premium seat capacity, and the ability to earn and redeem valuable miles on Alaska’s award-winning loyalty program.
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport currently offers 58 service options to 36 international destinations on 30 different airlines, and with Alaska Airlines’ announcement of three new services coming in 2026, SEA will offer over 60 international services.
Alaska is making substantial investments to the onboard experience over the next few years, including all-new interiors with updated lie-flat seats, a new premium economy cabin and upgraded main cabin seats, with new premium products and amenities to match the exceptional service provided by flight attendants.
The London route launch represents Alaska Airlines’ most significant step toward becoming a global carrier, leveraging its Seattle hub’s strategic position and the operational capabilities gained through the Hawaiian Airlines acquisition. As the airline builds toward its goal of 12 intercontinental destinations by 2030, the London service will serve as a flagship route demonstrating Alaska’s commitment to premium international service and connectivity for West Coast travelers.

            Hot Stocks 




            Netflix has submitted the highest bid to date for Warner Bros. Discovery’s studio and streaming assets, according to people familiar with the secretive bidding process.
    

            Netflix’s most recent offer, submitted on Thursday, valued the Warner Bros. studio, HBO Max streaming service and related parts of the company at around $28 per share, sources said.
    

            Paramount also submitted a new bid on Thursday, closer to $27 per share, one of the sources added.
    

            The two offers aren’t apples-to-apples, however, because Paramount has been trying to buy all of Warner Bros. Discovery, including CNN and other cable channels, while Netflix and another bidder, Comcast, have only shown interest in the studio and streaming assets.
    

            The mega-media bidding war has intensified in recent days, captivating a wide swath of Hollywood and garnering attention from the Trump White House. Iconic brands like HBO and DC Comics hang in the balance.
    

            Representatives for the companies involved have declined to comment. But leaks out of what is supposed to be a confidential process suggest that Netflix now has the pole position.
    

            Paramount certainly perceives it that way; the company’s attorneys wrote to Zaslav expressing “grave concerns” about the auction process.
    

            Specifically, Paramount’s attorneys charged that WBD has “embarked on a myopic process with a predetermined outcome that favors a single bidder,” meaning Netflix.
    

            Analysts said the letter could be a precursor to a hostile-takeover play by Paramount, which has moved aggressively in recent months under new CEO David Ellison’s leadership.
    

            Late Thursday, Bloomberg reported that WBD and Netflix have entered exclusive talks.
    

            Ellison kickstarted the auction process earlier in the fall by submitting multiple bids to WBD CEO David Zaslav and the company’s board.
    

            Analysts at the time predicted that a bidding war would break out, and that’s exactly what has happened, given that famed movie and TV studios rarely come onto the market.
    

            Zaslav officially put up the for-sale sign in October. At the same time, he said that WBD’s previously announced plan to split the company into two publicly traded halves would continue to be pursued.
    

            The WBD board had been under pressure to do something, since the company’s stock plummeted after it was formed through a 2022 merger, from roughly $25 a share to a low of $7.52.
    

            The split plan helped to rejuvenate WBD’s shares earlier this year, and then word of Paramount’s offers sent the stock skyrocketing back toward $25.
    

            Sources in Ellison’s camp have emphasized that Paramount would be disciplined in its pursuit of the Warner assets.
    

            Meanwhile, people in Zaslav’s camp have argued that the proposed split was the best way to realize the value of all of WBD.
    

            If the split still takes effect next year, the Warner Bros. half would house HBO Max and the movie studio, and the Discovery Global half would house CNN and other cable channels.
    

            Paramount may have been trying to get ahead of the split by making unsolicited bids for the whole company.
    

            Ellison’s pursuit is audacious, to be sure: Paramount’s market cap is currently one-fourth the size of WBD’s market cap.
    

            But Ellison and his management team have been moving fast to revitalize Paramount and disprove skeptics across Hollywood.
    

            It’s impossible to make sense of the WBD bidding war without understanding the “Trump card.”
    

            Ellison and Paramount are perceived to have a mutually beneficial relationship with President Trump and the White House — and thus an advantage in getting any deal approved by the Trump administration. “That’s the Trump card,” an Ellison adviser remarked to CNN in October.
    

            Past administrations proudly insisted that agencies like the Department of Justice, which enforces antitrust law, were independent of the president. Trump has replaced those norms with a new, overtly transactional approach.
    

            Trump has repeatedly praised Ellison and his father Larry, Oracle’s executive chairman, who is a key player in Trump’s dealings with TikTok.
    

            “They’re friends of mine. They’re big supporters of mine,” the president said in mid-October.
    

            Numerous Republican lawmakers have also cheered the Ellison takeover of CBS and the rest of Paramount, especially the installation of Bari Weiss as editor in chief of CBS News.
    

            Ellison has been both credited and criticized for forging a relationship with Trump’s inner circle this year despite donating nearly $1 million to Joe Biden’s reelection campaign last year.
    

            Just a couple of weeks ago, Ellison landed an invitation to Trump’s White House dinner for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
    

            What some have seen as savvy business practices, others have seen as media capitulation. And Ellison has stayed mostly quiet about the matter.
    

            On Wednesday he was scheduled to appear at the DealBook Summit, an annual conference hosted by The New York Times in Manhattan. But he withdrew from the summit amid the negotiations with WBD and was later spotted back in Washington, D.C. for talks with officials there.
    

            During the WBD bidding process, Paramount executives have bluntly argued that their offer will pass muster with Trump administration regulators while rival offers will not.
    

            After all, any proposed sale could be held up for months, and even years, in Washington, either by Trump loyalists carrying out his wishes or by bureaucrats with genuine objections to media consolidation.
    

            But Trump does not get a literal veto. When the Justice Department in 2017 sued to stop AT&T’s merger with Time Warner, a forerunner to WBD, the companies fought the case in court and prevailed.
    

            Some Wall Street analysts have asserted that Netflix may be willing to stomach a similar legal battle.
    

            Plus, Washington is not the only regulatory battleground that media companies have to worry about.
    

            A WBD sale, in whole or in part, would face scrutiny in the United Kingdom, the European Union and some Latin American countries. Sources previously told CNN that the perception of Trump clearing the way for the Ellisons in the US could hurt them in other markets.
    

            Media reports about Netflix emerging as the frontrunner for WBD’s studio and streaming assets have prompted some Republican elected officials to raise alarms about the prospective combination.
    

            “Learning about Netflix’s ambition to buy its real competitive threat — WBD’s streaming business — should send alarm to antitrust enforcers around the world,” Sen. Mike Lee wrote on X. “This potential transaction, if it were to materialize, would raise serious competition questions — perhaps more so than any transaction I’ve seen in about a decade.”
    

            A recent Bank of America analyst report put it this way: “If Netflix acquires Warner Bros., the streaming wars are effectively over. Netflix would become the undisputed global powerhouse of Hollywood beyond even its currently lofty position.”

31,2025-12-05,"It's the first week of December, and we're witnessing something unusual in iPhone history. The iPhone 17 is still sold out in the U.S. and various key international markets, especially the standard iPhone 17 model. The iPhone 17 Pro Max is now easier to find than the standard iPhone 17 in several markets, including the U.S. That's not what usually happens with Apple's newest iPhones. The Pro and Pro Max are the first to sell out, and the most likely to experience stock issues during the December quarter.
This year, the base iPhone 17 is a massive success for Apple. As you'll see below, buyers need to wait between three and seven business days for an iPhone 17 delivery. The iPhone 17 Pro Max is in stock in multiple markets, though certain storage tiers might be sold out. The iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone Air aren't experiencing shortages in the markets we looked at on Friday.
BGR has been tracking iPhone 17 delivery times since preorders began. Every Friday, with the exception of Black Friday, we've reported the delivery estimates for the four new iPhone models based on data we obtained from Apple's online stores for the U.S., Canada, U.K., France, Switzerland, Germany, Ireland, China, and Japan. The process is identical for each market. We simulate placing an order on Apple's online store for each of the four iPhone models. We look at all color and storage combinations for each version, and Apple's system offers a shipping estimate.
This week's stock data tells us Apple has been catching up with iPhone 17 demand. iPhone 17 Pro Max shipping estimates have improved compared to two weeks ago. Even in the U.S., the 256GB, 512GB, and 2TB versions are in stock. Interestingly, the 1TB model has a wait time of 3-5 days in North America, going up to 7-10 days in China. Our figures below reflect the different shipping estimates you'll see on Apple.com depending on the iPhone 17 Pro Max storage option you select.
The base iPhone 17 saw shipping estimates improve in North America and China, but stock constraints reappeared in other markets.  As of this writing, both storage options (256GB and 512GB) across all five color choices are sold out in the markets we follow. Shipping times stand at 3-5 business days for Europe and Asia and 5-7 business days for North America. Interestingly, the iPhone 17 is sold out in Japan again, a market where the handset was in stock two weeks ago:
An IDC report earlier this week showed that the iPhone 17 series will drive a record quarter and year for Apple. Also, the iPhone 17 has helped the entire smartphone market exceed growth expectations. Our checks indicate iPhone 17 demand remains strong in December."

Reddit is getting rid of one of its oldest fixtures.
The platform's CEO, Steve Huffman, said in a post that Reddit would be removing its r/popular feed from the homepage for new users to promote a more personalized and relevant user experience.
The popular feed, located on the left sidebar of the website, displays the most liked recent posts across the platform.
""In theory, it's what's most popular on Reddit, but it's actually what is liked by the most active users on Reddit—which is not the same thing,"" he said. ""Having it as a default feed gives the false impression of a singular Reddit culture, one that is neither representative of Reddit nor appealing to new users (or anyone at all, IMO).""
He summed up his disdain for the feature by saying, ""r/popular sucks, and we're moving away from it, and towards better, more relevant and personalized feeds.""
Huffman, who has been the platform's CEO since 2015, said Reddit would stop showing the popular feed in the sidebar unless users read it regularly.
He said his favorite part of Reddit was that every community on the platform had its own unique culture, rules, and sense of humor.
""And if your perspective isn't represented, you can create the community you want to see,"" he said. ""The freedom to build your own corner of the internet is what makes Reddit, Reddit.""
The platform gets 116 million visitors daily, he said. Reddit's stock price has risen about 44% in the past year.
In the post, he announced a few other changes, like limiting the number of high-traffic communities a single person can moderate, and changing the way it shows community sizes.
""These changes are all part of the same goal: making Reddit more conducive to how people actually use it today,"" he said.
This is not Reddit's first effort to nudge its users into smaller community groups, as it recalibrates its platform alongside competitors like Quora, and beyond that, the likes of Meta. 
In October, Reddit removed its public chat feature and urged users to chat on private group chats as a way to ""connect with communities in smaller, focused spaces.""

33,2025-12-05,"'Netflix and chill' just got an upgrade!

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Netflix announced its $82.7 billion acquisition of Warner Bros. earlier today(Dec. 5), acquiring over a century of cinematic legacy by the streaming giant. Netflix was up against other companies, including Paramount Skydance, and Comcast. However, Netflix ultimately secured the deal with Warner Bros. after weeks of negotiations, with its highly competitive, mostly cash offer, according to some reports. 
This means iconic content like The Big Bang Theory, The Sopranos, Game of Thrones, along the DC Universe will join Netflix’s platform. Meaning, all the content on Warner Bros. (the studio), HBO, and the HBO Max streaming service will now be owned by Netflix.
“Today’s announcement combines two of the greatest storytelling companies in the world to bring to even more people the entertainment they love to watch the most,” said David Zaslav, president and CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, in a press release.
 



This move comes at a time when we witnessed intense content dispute between Disney and YouTube, which resulted in a weeks-long blackout for consumers. Combining the world's largest streaming platform with Hollywood's renowned studios makes Netflix one of the most dominant players in the content market. This could make it really tough on smaller streaming services to keep up with the massive Netflix-Warner entity.
While Netflix and Warner Bros. are optimistic about the acquisition, considering this enhances Netflix’s potential, allowing the company to significantly expand in the U.S. and gain a large foothold in the country.
However, on the flip side, there could be other concerns brewing. Some analysts think that this deal could face intense regulatory scrutiny and anti-trust battles in both the U.S. and Europe, when it comes to one large company essentially trying to monopolize the streaming industry. Critics argue that merging these two could grant Netflix ""too much power over Hollywood.""
 



It is highly likely that all of HBO and HBO Max will be pulled into Netflix's already large catalog of entertainment. “By combining Warner Bros.’ incredible library of shows and movies—from timeless classics like Casablanca and Citizen Kane to modern favorites like Harry Potter and Friends. Together, we can give audiences more of what they love and help define the next century of storytelling,” said Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix, in a press release.

This also means that users stick to one platform, without having to switch between multiple apps and streaming services, and have all their favorite shows under one roof. They won't have to worry about licensing issues seen when some Warner Bros. shows move to other streaming services.
That said, sources close to the negotiations informed Reuters that the acquisition could actually be good for consumers. They stated that ""the potential combination of its streaming service with HBO Max would benefit consumers by lowering the cost of a bundled offering.""
Lastly, it is important to note that while the acquisition has been confirmed, Netflix states that HBO Max will likely operate separately for 12 to 18 months while they close the transaction, but this could keep HBO Max's subscribers in limbo, having them decide if they'd want to ditch the service until things move over to Netflix.
We're curious what you think about this acquisition! Sticking with both services, or just one for now? Let us know in the comments!

35,2025-12-05,"A Louisville Metro Police officer and another individual were hospitalized following an early-morning car crash in downtown Dec. 5.
The crash was reported at 3:19 a.m. after the officer who was injured responded to a report of a break-in, a statement from the department said. The officer's cruiser, which LMPD said had its lights and siren activated, collided with another passenger vehicle at the intersection of 2nd Street and West Market Street.
Emergency Medical Services and the Louisville Fire Department responded to the crash. Both vehicles were damaged along with a utility pole, according to the LMPD statement. Both drivers — the officer, who was not named, and another adult — were alert as they were taken to the hospital with injuries not believed to be life-threatening.
Footage from WAVE shows the crash occurred on the northwest corner of the intersection. The cruiser appeared significantly damaged. A MetroSafe supervisor told The Courier Journal the crash knocked out stoplights at the intersection and crews were working to fix them as of about 8 a.m.

 Howl's Moving Castle Deluxe Limited Edition (Hardcover) 
 $20 (was $25) | In stock December 4 
 World of Howl Trilogy Box Set (Paperback) 
 $22.38 (was $32) | Limited-time deal 
 
Howl's Moving Castle Deluxe Limited Edition is back in stock for $20 (was $25) at Amazon. The recently released collectible hardcover edition of Diana Wynne Jones' classic fantasy novel had been sold out for about a month at multiple retailers. Along with the restock of the Deluxe Limited Edition, Amazon has a limited-time deal on the new World of Howl Trilogy Box Set that drops the price to only $22.38.
The Deluxe Limited Edition and World of Howl Box Set would look great displayed next to the Steelbook Edition of Studio Ghibli's animated adaptation. The 2004 adaptation written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki strays considerably from the source material, but both the film and novel are magical in their own ways.
The 352-page Deluxe Limited Edition of Howl's Moving Castle features beautiful new jacket art, full-color endpapers by artist Devin Elle Kurtz, black-and-white illustrations throughout the novel, and more premium flourishes. The publisher recreated a starry night sky by digitally printing the blue page edges. Bright white streaks resemble shooting stars.
Beneath the dust jacket you'll find gold foil-stamped text and shooting star graphics on the front/back covers and spine. The front cover features a well-known line from the novel: ""Howl's quite heartless, you know.""
If you've never read the novel, Howl's Moving Castle follows Sophie Hatter after she accidentally attracts the attention of the Witch of the Waste. Transformed into an old woman, Sophie's only chance at breaking her curse lies within the Wizard Howl's castle, a mobile base ruled by an infamous heartbreaker who is tormented by dark secrets from his past.
Howl's Moving Castle Deluxe Limited Edition was published September 9 by Greenwillow Books. In addition to Amazon, the $20 deal is available at Walmart.
As mentioned, the new World of Howl Trilogy Box Set is on sale for cheap at Amazon. Greenwillow Books published the slipcased paperback set on October 7.
Howl's Moving Castle is the first book in the World of Howl Trilogy. It was followed up by Castle in the Air in 1990 and House of Many Ways in 2008. All three books are standalone stories with different protagonists, but Howl appears in both of the follow-ups, so you should read Howl's Moving Castle first.
Castle in the Air follows unsuccessful carpet salesman Abdullah as he daydreams about a more adventurous life. House of Many Ways focuses on Charmain Baker as she explores a family home that can bend time and space.
All three novels are also available individually in paperback, and standard edition hardcovers with durable library bindings of the first two books are in print, too. Amazon's deal on the box set makes it cheaper than the price of the three books combined.
World of Howl Series:
As mentioned, the 2004 Studio Ghibli film deviated quite a bit from the book, as it featured a different aesthetic, certain characters stuck around for much longer, and even the dynamic between Sophie and Howl plays out in an unconventional way.
If you want to add the Studio Ghibli adaptation to your home movie collection, you can get the Howl's Moving Castle Limited Edition Steelbook for only $18 or the standard edition for $15. Both editions come with Blu-ray and DVD versions of the film as well as a nice selection of special features, including storyboards, documentaries, interviews, original promotional materials, and a booklet with artwork and commentary. Another option is the Walmart-exclusive Howl's Moving Castle and Spirited Away 2-Film Box Set for $23. This is the same standard edition, but you also get Spirited Away's standard edition. Howl's Moving Castle has a star-studded cast of voice actors, including Christian Bale, Jean Simmons, and Billy Crystal, who voiced various characters.
Howling's Moving Castle on Blu-ray:
Studio Ghibli Howl's Moving Castle Books:
The film adaptation also has an official art book, a picture book, and a four-volume comic book adaptation. The Art of Howl's Moving Castle offers a sprawling collection of concept sketches, fully rendered character and background drawings, paintings and cell images, and commentary from the Studio Ghibli crew that worked on the movie. Unfortunately, the first volume in the official Film Comic series is difficult to find for a reasonable price, while the other three are still readily available for $10 each.

Howl's Moving Castle is just one of numerous Studio Ghibli animated films inspired by a novel, short story, or manga. We've rounded up some of the other adaptations and their source materials below. We only included Ghibli films that pull from source material that's readily available in English. At the bottom, you'll also find a few examples of the reverse situation: written and illustrated stories adapted from Studio Ghibli films.
Written by. Eiko Kadono and illustrated by Akiko Hayashi, Kiki's Delivery Service is a popular Japanese children's novel originally published in 1985. Hayao Miyazaki wrote and directed the 1989 animated adaptation. The adaptation has an official art book as well as a comic adaptation of its own.
The 2006 Ghibli film Tales from Earthsea is a notable one here because Goro Miyazaki--Hayao Miyazaki's son--adapted parts of Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea series as well as his father's graphic novel Shuna's Journey. The film pulls from the first four novels in Le Guin's classic fantasy series. A Wizard of Earthsea, the first novel in the fantasy series, was published in 1968. Humorously, the film gets its name from the fifth book in the series, but it doesn't include elements from its namesake.
Shuna's Journey, meanwhile, was published in Japanese in 1983 and received an English translation in 2022. It has beautiful watercolor artwork by Hayao Miyazaki. We'd also highly recommend The Books of Earthsea: The Complete Illustrated Edition, a lavish 1,008-page hardcover collecting Le Guin's full series.
The Borrowers, a 1952 fantasy novel written by Mary Norton was adapted by Studio Ghibli in 2010 as The Secret World of Arietty. Hayao Miyazaki wrote the screenplay, and Hiromasa Yonebayashi directed the film.
When Marnie Was There, a 1967 children's novel by Joan G. Robinson, was adapted to a film of the same name in 2014. Yonebayashi directed and co-wrote the psychological drama.
Baron the Cat, a 2002 manga by Aoi Hiiragi, was adapted the same year as The Cat Returns. Aoi Hiiragi's manga was translated to English in 2005 with the title Baron: The Cat Returns. The Baron from the book and movie previously appeared in Studio Ghibli's 1995 film Whisper of the Heart. This is because Aoi Hiiragi also wrote the original manga it's based on. Unfortunately, the 1989 manga Mimi o Sumaseba has never received an English translation.
Hayao Miyazaki has adapted exactly one of his own published works: Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. First published in 1982, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is Miyazaki's only manga series. He based the screenplay for the 1984 film adaptation on parts of the first and second volumes of what eventually ended as a seven-volume series in 1994. Since the manga ran for a decade after the film's release, it's no surprise that the 1,100-plus page series is markedly different than the movie. The Nausicaa manga is available in trade paperback or in a deluxe, two-volume hardcover box set with a display case, fully illustrated endpapers, and a watercolor poster. Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind's Blu-ray and DVD combo pack is one of many Studio Ghibli films available with a steelbook case.
 Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind Manga Box Set (Hardcover) 
 $47.89 (was $80) 
My Neighbor Totoro isn't like the films and books listed above. Written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, My Neighbor Totoro released in 1988. A four-volume ani-manga released in Japan almost simultaneously. Viz Media translated those volumes to English in 2004-05. Just last year, all four were reprinted as My Neighbor Totoro Film Comic: All-in-One Edition. The nearly 600-page hardcover book is available for the bargain price of $30. The film was also adapted into a picture book the same year it released. For Totoro's 25th anniversary, author Tsugiko wrote a novelization of My Neighbor Totoro with illustrations by Miyazaki.
My Neighbor Totoro and Kiki's Delivery Service aren't the only Studio Ghibli films to receive ani-manga (film comics in the US) adaptations. Fans can also get omnibus editions of comics adapted from Spirited Away and Ponyo. The 856-page Spirited Away Film Comic: All-in-One Edition is on sale for $25.60 (was $35). Ponyo's All-in-One Edition released in July and is up for grabs for $25.87 (was $30). Ghibli fans can preorder the Princess Mononoke Film Comic: All-in-One Edition and Castle in the Sky's All-in-One Edition ahead of their January and July releases, respectively.

Like a helicopter too heavy for lift off, tech companies are ditching anything they don't view as essential to get their AI plans off the ground.
Meta is planning to cut its metaverse division's budget by as much as 30% and considering job cuts as part of the move, writes BI's Jyoti Mann and Pranav Dixit. The decision comes as tech companies look to pare back anything not directly focused on giving them an edge in the AI wars.
Investors loved the move, with the stock finishing the day up almost 3.5%.
For Meta, ditching the metaverse has been a long time coming. (We actually declared it dead back in checks notes May 2023.) During Meta's most recent earnings call, the word ""metaverse"" wasn't even used once.
It's quite the reversal from when the metaverse was the literal inspiration for the entire company's rebrand from Facebook. But it's tough to keep making the case for funding something that burns billions of dollars and doesn't directly generate a ton of revenue.
Especially when you need to make room for AI plans that are burning billions of dollars and have yet to directly generate a ton of revenue.
Meta is unlikely to be the last company to cut non-AI-related fat.
AI projects are really expensive. From hardware to talent to power, there doesn't appear to be a ""cheap"" way to do it. The space is also incredibly competitive, and even the first movers are feeling the heat.
That's forcing companies to rethink their allocation of resources, particularly when it comes to projects that don't get them to their AI goals.
Even those focused solely on AI are recalibrating their approach. OpenAI is sidelining ancillary projects to solely focus on beefing up ChatGPT.
Tech companies with business lines already benefiting from the AI boom hold an advantage. Amazon, Google, and Microsoft's cloud businesses are experiencing an uptick from AI investments.
Those players aren't standing still, though. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella tapped a new advisor to ""rethink the new economics of AI.""
Next month could be a good indication of how much tech companies are willing to throw overboard to keep their AI dreams afloat. Several companies conducted layoffs at the start of the year as part of their annual culling.
Where companies draw the line will be interesting to watch. Money-losing endeavors not tied to AI will be obvious targets, but what about the stuff that is bringing in money but doesn't fit a company's future AI vision? How much will companies cut from what already is to support what could be?

Wall Street has begun rendering its verdict, at least in the short term, on Netflix‘s $82.7 billion deal to acquire Warner Bros.

	As is typical with acquisitions, the stock of the buyer lost ground by mid-day Friday, slipping 3% to just below $100, while the party being (mostly) acquired, Warner Bros. Discovery, gained ground. WBD’s 5% rise was not stratospheric, but the shares had already doubled since reports started circulating in September that the company could be sold, meaning that much of the premium was already priced in.

Paramount stock has emerged as the biggest loser thus far, falling 8%. While the shares have climbed 17% since the August close of the Skydance merger, they are well off the 52-week high of $20.86 established in September.

	










	Shares in Comcast, which was bidding against Netflix and Paramount for the WBD assets, ticked up 1%. Major exhibitors Cinemark and AMC Entertainment saw their stocks take a drubbing on investor fears that Netflix could alter the standard rollout of films in theaters, shortening or even eliminating theatrical windows. The company’s Co-CEO, Ted Sarandos, said the current operations of the Warner Bros. film studio, including its theatrical output, would stay as is for the near future. Releases in theaters for films through 2029 are established in contracts that would prompt lawsuits if they were to be broken.




			Watch on Deadline		






	Wall Street analysts, who had a chance to quiz Netflix management during a pre-market conference call about the deal, have slowly been digesting the news. “We admit that we are still coming to terms with the official announcement this morning,” wrote MoffettNathanson’s Robert Fishman in a note to clients.

	Fishman went on to flag several concerns, citing signs of flagging engagement on Netflix, particularly in North America, as well as questions about HBO Max’s independence and the commitment to theatrical releases over the long term. The biggest question mark for many analysts is the regulatory outlook. Netflix expects the deal to close in the next 12 to 18 months, but questions abound, even with the streaming giant attaching a hefty $5.8 billion breakup fee to the deal.

	










	“As concern from the creative community or other regulating bodies grows, Netflix could be forced to navigate a more complex regulatory process,” Fishman wrote. “Ultimately, we think the likelihood of approval comes down to how successful Netflix will be in defining the market beyond the traditional media landscape to include other companies like YouTube, Amazon, and other digital players like TikTok and social media as they compete for engagement across the total day.”

	Doug Creutz of TD Cowen went a step further, writing in a research note that he expects the Netflix-WB deal to “face meaningful regulatory scrutiny.” He added his belief that “it is far from certain that the deal gets approved.” If it were to be blocked, he said, “it would open up a potential path” for Paramount to re-start deal talks. The David Ellison-led company has put in four bids for all of WBD, and earlier this week registered its strong objections to the way Warner has been conducting the process.

	With WBD off the table (for now), Creutz warns that investors “will want to see more clarity for specific plans for the Paramount assets.”

44,2025-12-05,"The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL is a certified large-screened beast.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Just a few leftover Black Friday phone deals remain, including 29% off the price of the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL at Amazon. The Pixel 10 Pro XL is our favorite Android phone for parents, in no small part due to its powerful range of cameras, its large OLED display, and its huge performance improvements over previous generations. It features a wide camera lens, a telephoto, and an ultrawide lens on the rear, as well as a powerful front-facing camera.
The 10 Pro XL normally retails at $1,200, so keeping an eye out for deals like this is definitely the move. To be sure, this is also the lowest price ever recorded for the phone at Amazon, so it's not a bad pick if you're already in the market for something in the premium price range.
Google Pixel 10 Pro XL: $1,199.00 $849.00 at Amazon
Amazon has chopped $350 off the price of the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL, which is our top pick for the best Android phone for parents. The discount brings this premium-level Pixel phone down to just $850, representing a pretty solid price for the offering.
✅Recommended if: you're looking for a phone with a really powerful set of cameras and access to AI processing features; you want a phone that has built-in Qi2 magnets and Pixelsnap; you'd prefer a phone that can handle gaming and other power-intensive tasks, and you have the budget to pay a premium price tag, even if discounted.
❌Skip this deal if: you're in the U.S. and need to be able to use an eSIM; you need something with top-notch PWM settings; you're looking for industry-leading processing speeds and would rather go with a Qualcomm-backed device.
The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL is a powerhouse, boasting a 6.8-inch Super Actua OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate. The Google Tensor G5 also offers significant performance improvements over previous generations of the Pixel, making for smoother gaming. While it still doesn't quite hold up to some premium-level, Qualcomm-backed phones, it's still a welcome upgrade and it gets multi-tasking help from the 16GB of RAM.
As for cameras, this Pixel has a 50MP main lens, a 48MP ultrawide with macro focus, a 48MP telephoto, and a 42MP selfie cam. It also comes with a 5,200mAh battery, 45W wired fast charging, and Qi2 Pixelsnap wireless magnets built in.
Some of the biggest downsides to the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL are its lack of a SIM card tray in the U.S., some battery throttling, and a PWM rate that isn't suitable for many with sensitive eyes. If these aren't dealbreakers for you, then an $850 price tag is a good opportunity to pick this premium phone up, at the very least.

45,2025-12-05,"Google Home Speaker is coming in Spring 2026, but Motorola's new Soundflow smart speaker might enter the mix as well. 

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Google is upgrading its smart home ecosystem in a big way, with Gemini for Home rolling out now and new hardware in the mix. The company already refreshed the Nest line with new smart home cameras and doorbells, and there's a Google Home Speaker arriving in Spring 2026 to provide a modern answer to the Nest Mini and Nest Audio speakers. Aside from the giants in the smart home market like Google, Amazon, and Apple, there are always wild cards, and Motorola might soon be one of them.
Motorola appears to be gearing up to launch a smart speaker in collaboration with Bose that could rival Google's smart speaker offerings, according to Android Headlines. The publication surfaced leaked images of the new smart speaker, which could be called the Motorola Soundflow. It's a wireless Bluetooth speaker that looks to add smart functionality, perhaps with Gemini integration or another voice assistant.
 



The wireless speaker sports a cylindrical design with mesh fabric fully covering the sides. There's a base with the Motorola wordmark on it, plus an LED light ring at the top. In fact, the light-blue LEDs at the top of the rumored Motorola Soundflow speaker are reminiscent of the blue glow of Amazon's Echo smart speakers. The light ring, paired with a microphone button at the top of the Motorola Soundflow, suggests this will indeed be a smart speaker.
Unlike Google Home and Nest speakers, the Motorola Soundflow appears to be a wireless. This would put in the same realm as options like the Sonos Roam 2, a wireless smart speaker with Sonos Voice Control and Amazon Alexa support. It also invokes similarities to the Amazon Echo Tap, a forgotten wireless smart speaker that was discontinued in 2018.
Bose has been expanding its audio collaborations to bring its sound to other companies' products, like Motorola. Previously, Bose and Motorola worked together to make the Moto Buds Loop. This year, Bose also teamed up with Baseus to make cheaper earbuds and headphones with classic Bose sound.
Not many details are known about the Motorola Soundflow speaker, so we'll have to wait for an official announcement. If competitors like the Sonos Roam 2 are any indication, the Motorola smart speaker could be priced between $100 and $200.

46,2025-12-05,"Nubia Fold's 6,560mAh battery is a 49% gut punch to the Galaxy Z Fold 7.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

For years, the main complaint about foldable phones hasn’t been the crease. It’s been the trade-off: you usually have to pick between a slim design and a battery that lasts through dinner. Well, Nubia just threw a massive wrench in that narrative.
The new Nubia Fold is officially here, and instead of quietly joining the pack, it’s going after Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 7 with a bigger battery, a lower price, and the kind of specs you’d expect from something far more expensive.
Its headline feature is a colossal 6,560mAh battery (via Notebookcheck). To put that number in perspective, that’s not just ""good for a foldable"" — it’s arguably the biggest battery we’ve ever seen in the form factor. You’re looking at a power cell that significantly outpaces the Galaxy Z Fold 7 (4,400mAh).
What makes this launch even more aggressive is the price tag. The Nubia Fold has landed in Japan for ¥178,560, which converts to roughly $1,150. For that price, you get a book-style foldable running the powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite processor for nearly $800 less than Samsung’s latest offering. While competitors are pushing the $2,000 mark, Nubia is proving that the foldable tax doesn’t have to be quite so steep.
You aren't just paying for a big battery, either. The device features an expansive 8-inch OLED main display (120Hz, naturally) and a usable 6.5-inch cover screen. Despite packing that massive battery, Nubia managed to keep the chassis reasonably slim at 5.4mm unfolded and 11.1mm folded.
Of course, when you undercut the market leader by this much, corners get cut.
 



First, the cameras. Instead of the periscope zooms and high-end sensors found on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, the Nubia Fold sticks to a more modest setup: a 50MP main, a 50MP ultrawide, and a 5MP macro sensor.

Second, durability. The phone carries an IP54 rating. That means it can handle dust and a splash of water, but unlike the IP68-rated Galaxy Z Fold 7, this isn't a phone you want to drop in the pool.
At the moment, the Nubia Fold is only available in Japan. If Nubia releases it in other countries, it might push Samsung and other brands to reconsider their prices and battery choices for future models.

There's a bubble in talk of an ""AI bubble.""
The phrase ""AI bubble"" appeared in 42 earnings calls and investor conference transcripts between October and December — a 740% increase from the previous quarter, according to an AlphaSense analysis.
In the third quarter of 2025, five transcripts mentioned the term. The quarter before that, four. For all of 2024, executives and analysts used the phrase in 24 transcripts total. In 2023, it was nine. (The analysis counted transcripts where ""AI"" and ""bubble"" appeared within five words of each other.)
Now dozens of companies across semiconductors, cloud infrastructure, financial services, and industrials are fielding some version of the same question: Is the AI boom a bubble?
At UBS's Global Technology and AI Conference on December 2, AMD CEO Lisa Su told investors, ""from the standpoint of, you know, do we see a bubble? We don't see a bubble.""
Nvidia CFO Colette Kress similarly swatted the premise aside, describing it onstage as a ""supposed AI bubble.""
Her boss, CEO Jensen Huang, said as much in Nvidia's November earnings call. ""There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,"" he said. ""From our vantage point, we see something very different.""
Aixtron, a German semiconductor-equipment maker, was asked in its November earnings call whether customers might slow capacity plans if AI enthusiasm wanes. Coface, a Paris-based credit insurer, described re-running the math on big AI-related capital requests to ensure they hold up even if ""bubble-type enthusiasm"" fades.
So why the sudden spike?
Analysts pointed to the sheer scale of the numbers being tossed around.
""We've been seeing these huge partnerships and people throwing out money amounts for infrastructure — like trillions of dollars — which I can't remember ever hearing before,"" Sarah Hoffman, director of AI thought leadership at AlphaSense, told Business Insider. That gap between the trillions being invested and the billions in revenue from many AI efforts, she said, ""is what's getting people a little bit freaked out.""
Gil Luria, managing director and head of technology research at DA Davidson, said analysts and CEOs are voicing anxieties they're already hearing from investors.
Luria pointed to what he called ""circular transactions"" as one source of anxiety. ""Nvidia investing a dollar in CoreWeave, CoreWeave borrows nine, and uses eight of them to buy Nvidia chips,"" he said. ""That's the echoes of bubbles past.""
The past eight weeks have given bubble proponents plenty of ammunition.
Tech luminaries, including Sam Altman and Bill Gates, have said there's some froth in AI spending. In earnings calls this quarter, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon all said they planned to increase their spending on data centers that are the backbone of AI. Michael Burry, whose bet against the housing market was made famous in ""The Big Short,"" made headlines after he said he had shorted Nvidia, the world's most valuable company.
While executives have pushed back on skeptics, Luria said that only cash will quiet the conversation.
""There's nothing they can say that will change people's perception of whether or not there's a bubble,"" he said. ""The only thing they can do is show results, and those have to be financial results.""

Still got a “dumb” TV lacking all the smart features we’ve seen become a standard over the last decade? No need to upgrade just yet if it’s still working fine. Maybe just need to bring it into the modern age with the help of a Roku. Theyâre budget-friendly and simple to set up. And conveniently enough, Amazon is currently offering the Roku 4K HDR Streambar SE and Wireless Bass Bundle at a 35% discount. Itâs usually listed at $230, but for a short period you can grab it for only $150âmeaning you keep an extra $80 in your pocket.
Whether youâre trying to start streaming on a non-smart TV or youâre just not a fan of your smart TVâs clunky interface (looking at you, LG), plugging a Roku into one of your free HDMI ports is can make for a better experience. Youâll be able to access all the apps you rely on to stay caught up with new releases. Every Roku streaming device includes Bluetooth support and works with both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, letting it smoothly integrate into your broader smart home setup. Its remote also features a built-in voice assistant, making it simple to search for whatever content youâre looking for.

And speaking of the remote, itâs rechargeable, so you no longer need to stock AAAs. The backlit buttons make it easy to navigate in dim lighting without the usual fumbling around. Of course, you can also just say âHey Rokuâ and control everything via voice commands instead. If the remote ever goes missing, Roku even provides a lost-remote finder. Though, itâs probably slipped somewhere between your couch cushions. Maybe just check there.
The home screen is completely customizable, allowing you to keep your preferred streaming apps front and center. An interesting bonusâRoku actually has its own original programming. Alongside the apps you already subscribe to like Hulu, Netflix, Disney+, and Max, you can switch over to enjoy Rokuâs free original series such as Dinner Budget Showdown, Celebrity Family Food Battle, Martha Cooks, and Emeril Cooks. I promise, there’s more than only cooking shows. I just have food on the mind.





This holiday season bundle isn’t the standard Roku streamer. This is a multimedia player and speaker in one. This Roku soundbar sits under your TV so you can enjoy upgraded sound with all your shows and movies. The soundbarâor Streambar, ratherâis both your sound output and the source of the Roku interface itself. It just needs to plug into your TV over HDMI and you’re set.
The bundle is also throwing in the Roku Wireless Bass. This can kick your already great sound up a notch by bringing a subwoofer into the mix.
Go grab some snacks and let everyone know that the next movie night will be happening in your living roomâthanks to the Roku Streambar SE and Wireless Bass bundle, now available for just $150. I’d recommend putting that $70 you’re saving toward a popcorn machine.

If youâre after a PC that doesnât take up a lot of space on your desk but still offers incredible performance for all your work and play tasks, we highly recommend checking the Dell OptiPlex 7020 7000 MFF out.
This compact PC usually retails for around $2,400, which doesnât exactly make it a budget-friendly option, but thatâs not the case today. Right now, you can snap it up for just $699 at Amazon, after a massive 71% discount. The deal is open to both Prime and non-Prime members, but thereâs a catch you should know about. The retailer has listed the offer as a limited-time one, meaning you donât have a lot of time left to snag the savings. Grab it before the offer wraps up, or the stock ends for good.

This mini PC fits into compact spaces and cluttered desktops easily. You can place it near your monitor, or mount it on its back for a cleaner look; whichever you prefer. The small size also makes it convenient to take your entire setup with you around without feeling limited. Just toss it in your laptop bag, and youâre good to go. Of course, the space-saving design doesnât mean a compromise on performance. Dell has packed the PC with an 8-core 14th Gen Intel Core i3-14100T processor, which is capable enough of handling all your everyday tasks, such as browsing, streaming, working on creative projects, and more, with ease.
Thereâs a modest 16GB of DDR5 RAM to keep things snappy and running smoothly. Itâs not too massive, but still great for multitaskers who need to work on a bunch of different things at the same time. Youâll be able to communicate with your team on Slack, sort projects using Asana, track deadlines on Excel, and use a couple of programs; all at the same time, without feeling limited. Storage is taken care of by the massive 1TB M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD. Itâs spacious enough to house all your important media content, work files, and other documents in the same place. You can even throw in a few gaming titles! Best of all, SSDs are much faster than traditional hard drives when it comes to performance, so you can expect better boot times and quicker file transfers with this one.
Immersive visuals are made possible with the Intel UHD Graphics 730. Thereâs also support for up to 4 simultaneous displays with up to 4K resolution using one HDMI, one USB Type-C, and two DisplayPort video outputs; great for professionals looking for a bigger setup. You can take video calls on one display, work on a creative project on the main one, and have reference documents open on the third; the possibilities are endless. As for the connectivity options, youâre getting Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth, a Universal Audio port, a USB 3.2 Gen 1 (5 Gbps) Type-A port with PowerShare, a USB 3.2 Gen 2×2 (10 Gbps) Type-C port, an RJ-45 Ethernet port, a USB 2.0 Type-A port (480 Mbps), a USB 2.0 Type-A port (480 Mbps) with SmartPower on, two USB 3.2 Type-A Gen 1 (5 Gbps) ports, two DisplayPort 1.4a ports, one HDMI 1.4b port, and one Power Adapter port. Windows 11 Pro also comes pre-installed; youâll have a full setup ready to go.
Itâs best to grab your PC quickly, because once the discount is gone, thereâs no telling if itâs going to be back anytime soon.

55,2025-12-05,"“Our mission has always been to entertain the world,” said Ted Sarandos.
Netflix has announced that it has entered a “definitive agreement” to acquire Warner Bros. -- including its film and television studios, HBO Max and HBO -- in a deal valued at approximately $83 billion, according to the company.
""This acquisition brings together two pioneering entertainment businesses, combining Netflix’s innovation, global reach and best-in-class streaming service with Warner Bros.’ century-long legacy of world-class storytelling,"" Netflix said in the statement released Friday morning.
""Beloved franchises, shows and movies such as The Big Bang Theory, The Sopranos, Game of Thrones, The Wizard of Oz and the DC Universe will join Netflix’s extensive portfolio including Wednesday, Money Heist, Bridgerton, Adolescence and Extraction, creating an extraordinary entertainment offering for audiences worldwide,"" the company continued.
The transaction is expected to close after the previously announced separation of WBD’s Global Networks division, Discovery Global, into a new publicly-traded company, which is now expected to be completed in Q3 2026, Netflix said.
“Our mission has always been to entertain the world,” said Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix. “By combining Warner Bros.’ incredible library of shows and movies—from timeless classics like Casablanca and Citizen Kane to modern favorites like Harry Potter and Friends—with our culture-defining titles like Stranger Things, KPop Demon Hunters and Squid Game, we'll be able to do that even better. Together, we can give audiences more of what they love and help define the next century of storytelling.”
The cash and stock transaction has a total enterprise value of approximately $82.7 billion and an equity value of $72 billion, Netflix said.

Amazon has limited-time deals on the matching Steelbook Editions for Seasons 1-3 and the newly released Final Season Complete Steelbook Edition.
By 
    Steven Petite
   on December 5, 2025 at 8:14AM PST
 Attack on Titan: Final Season Complete Steelbook (Blu-ray) 
 $54.22 (was $70) 
 Attack on Titan Limited Edition Steelbooks (Blu-ray) 
 Save up to 50% on Seasons 1-3 
 
Attack on Titan fans can get collectible Steelbook Editions of all four seasons of the anime for extremely good prices this week. Attack on Titan: The Final Season Complete Steelbook Edition released November 25 and is on sale for $54.22 (was $70) at Amazon. You can pair the new release with the Steelbook Editions of Seasons 1-3 that launched last December. This is the first time we've seen all three in stock at Amazon since The Final Season Steelbook preorders opened in August. More importantly, Amazon has limited-time deals that drop the price of each Steelbook Edition to nearly 50% the original $70 list price.
With the prices above, fans can purchase the full 94-episode series with four steelbook cases and 16 Blu-ray discs for $164 (was $280).
The Steelbook Edition for Attack on Titan's Final Season is a bargain even if you pay full price. Parts 1-3 initially released individually for $65-$70 each without steelbook cases. Even with limited-time deals on two of the three parts, you'd spend roughly $104 on the standard editions. Because Attack on Titan's fourth and final season was split into three parts that aired over three years, the Complete Steelbook Edition effectively has multiple seasons of content in one seven-disc package.
Check out the Final Season Complete Steelbook and a breakdown of Attack on Titan's previous Blu-ray releases for Seasons 1-4. We've also outlined the best ways to complete your Attack on Titan manga collection, including this year's release of the Attack on Titan Fly Collector's Box.
Attack on Titan Anime & Manga
The Complete Steelbook Edition includes all 35 episodes from Attack on Titan's three-part Final Season:
Part 3 initially aired as two lengthy TV specials in 2023. On the same day the second TV special debuted, the first one was split into three regular episodes. Then, two weeks after the finale, the second, even longer special aired as four episodes. As such, the Final Season essentially has 35 total episodes totaling 986 minutes (roughly 16.5 hours). For comparison, the next longest season was the first with 25 episodes.
The seven-disc Blu-ray set also comes with numerous special features:
Attack on Titan: Final Season Steelbook Bonus Content
 
Attack on Titan's first three seasons received fresh Steelbook Edition Blu-rays last December for $70 each. Unfortunately, the artwork on these does not match the Final Season Steelbook. These have been difficult to find in stock for most of the year, so it's awesome to see them available at Amazon with roughly 50% discounts.
We doubt these will remain in stock for long. Walmart is sold out of all three. Resellers have Seasons 1-3 listed for $52-$58 on Walmart Marketplace.
The Season 1 Steelbook Edition comes with four discs and 25 episodes; Season 2 is a two-disc set with 12 episodes; and Season 3 is three discs with 22 episodes.
 
 
 
 Attack on Titan Anime 
 Check out all four seasons on Blu-ray, including Steelbook and Limited Editions. 
 
 
As mentioned, Amazon has limited-time deals on the standard editions of all three parts of the Final Season, but you'd still wind up spending double the cost of the Complete Steelbook Edition. The Limited Editions for Parts 1-3 are sold out and priced higher than their original $90 prices by resellers. The Limited Edition for Part 3 includes a 148-page art book, 32-page digibook, seven art cards, and two enamel pins.
Standard edition box sets are also available for the first three seasons, though prices for Seasons 2 and 3 are very close to the Steelbook Editions right now. That said, you can get the Limited Edition for Season 2 for only $47.47 (was $85). This version includes a 60-page art book and 24-page digibook. Season 2's standard edition is the only one that's actually more expensive than its Steelbook Edition.
Each Blu-ray in the list below contains a complete season of Attack on Titan.
Just like with the Final Season, Seasons 1 and 3 were also originally released in multiple parts. Season 1 is still available in two parts on Blu-ray, but it's almost always cheaper to buy the complete version instead.
Big Attack on Titan fans may be interested in checking out the recently released Attack on Titan Fly Collector's Box Set. Published in June by Kodansha Comics, this unique, limited-edition collectible set is on sale for $198.25 (was $250) at Amazon. Notably, this box set contains the only English translation of Volume 35 of Attack on Titan, the true final volume in the original manga series. The box set also includes a 216-page hardcover art book and a number of additional collectibles:
 Attack on Titan 35: Fly Collector's Box Set 
 $198.25 (was $250) 
 Attack on Titan Manga Box Sets 
 Check out all seven box sets with exclusive bonuses. 
Attack on Titan's original 34-volume manga series has been collected in multiple budget-friendly editions over the years. For newcomers who want to read the manga and then watch the anime, one cool way to engage with the franchise is to check out the Attack on Titan box set editions of the manga and then watch the corresponding seasons. The manga box sets are named based on the events covered in the anime.
Each box set comes packaged in a slipcase and includes exclusive bonuses, which we've noted below. Notably, the box sets for Seasons 3-4 each include an extra book with exclusive Attack on Titan short stories. At the moment, you'd spend roughly $233 for the complete set of seven Attack on Titan box sets.
 Attack on Titan Manga Omnibus Editions 
 Check out all 12 oversized paperbacks with embossed cover art. 
The second budget-friendly way to read Attack on Titan in physical format is to pick up the 12 Omnibus Editions for $20 (or less) each. The Omnibus Editions don't include the extras, but these thick paperbacks are arguably better because they have larger pages and embossed cover art. The first 10 Omnibus Editions are 576 pages each and collect three volumes. Omnibus 11 (384 pages) and 12 (448 pages) contain two volumes each.
The combined MSRP for all 12 ($240) is substantially less than the combined MSRP of the box sets ($374). With current deals at Amazon, all 12 Omnibus Editions would cost you just under $189, so you're saving about $45 compared to the box sets.
Attack on Titan's 34-volume arc is also available in traditional paperback digest editions. Each volume retails for $11, but you can save several bucks on a bunch of them. For instance, Attack on Titan Volume 1 is only $6.77 at Amazon.

The Super Mario Galaxy Movie 
Since moving to New York City, my social media algorithm has completely rewired to show me about the current happenings, big and small, in the city. If you donât live here, you might not have heard of an up-and-coming local celebrity: a giant stuffed Yoshi thatâs been sitting on some subway tracks in Brooklyn for almost a month.
I first caught wind of what is slowly becoming colloquially known as the âClasson Ave Yoshiâ on December 4 after a TikTok video from user @jeremypinson321 came across my For You Page. The earliest mention I can find of this poor, battered baby dinosaur was on November 14, when New Yorkers first found him lying in the middle of the tracks at the Classon Avenue G train station, which is on the west side of Bedford-Stuyvesant, a neighborhood in Brooklyn.
Worst crime in NYC ð #nyc #mario #yoshi 
 â¬ original sound – binho 
 
At some point in the past few days, some kind soul got onto the tracks and helped the Classon Ave Yoshi. Heâs no longer laid out like heâd been thrown from an open subway door, and instead is propped up on one of the pillars on the tracks.Â 
weâre making progress ð®#yoshi #mta #tether #soulbrother #mario 
 â¬ Bowser’s Theme (From “Super Mario 64”) – Whaleinator 
 
After a recent night out with friends, I took a detour to see if Yoshi was still there, and lo and behold, the tattered toy was chilling against the pillar.Â 
I didnât anticipate it being as large as it was, but make no mistake, this is a giant plush. I wasnât about to walk on the train tracks and get either arrested or killed by an incoming train or the electrified tracks to find out his actual size, but this Yoshi is probably at least two feet tall, and seems to have an official Super Mario-branded tag on its hand. I looked around to try and figure out which plush this might be, but there are several big, stuffed Yoshis on the market. I couldnât nail it down without putting my life at risk.
The environmental storytelling of the Classon Ave Yoshi is tragic. Did a child lose their best friend on the way home? Could a parent who bought it for their kid for the holidays have dropped it as they hurried off the subway? Is this just a joke some prankster teenager is playing to see how social media tracks the poor guyâs encroaching filth? It could just be a cheap promotion for the upcoming Super Mario Galaxy Movie, which Yoshi will debut in. We’ve reached out to the MTA for comment and will update the story if we hear back.
As someone who watched Toy Story too much as a kid, the sight of a stuffed animal being left behind and exposed to the elements of a New York City subway station elicits an uncomfortable amount of empathy from me. I wish I could save him from this terrible fate, and I’m not the only one. As I was waiting for the G train to arrive to take me home, a pair of New Yorkers also pulled out their phones to capture the Classon Avenue Yoshiâs plight, and said, âI want to save him!â As of last night, heâs still chilling against a pillar. I need a heartwarming comeback story from this. Someone save Yoshi and get him to a toy preservationist who can make him good as new, then send him to a museum. Heâs part of New York City history now.
Update: 12/5/2025, 12:48 p.m.:Â The MTA has confirmed in a statement toÂ Kotaku that the Yoshi plush has been removed from the tracks. We have inquired about whether or not the stuff animal has been sent to the lost and found, or has been discarded and will update when we hear back.
Update: 12/5/2025, 4:28 p.m.:Â A TikTok user has posted an image of MTA workers removing Yoshi from the tracks,
KotakuÂ asked if we could claim the Yoshi to try and find its original owner, and an MTA spokesperson said that the crew had followed its internal processes to add it to the NYC Transit lost and found.

67,2025-12-05,"The motorcycle market is packed with global players. Some come with an expertise in engineering, some in design, others in historical roots, and with the onset of electric motos, brands of late also seem to come with the extra edge of modern-day innovation. But only one two-wheeler company can boast of being the world’s largest EV manufacturer (by volume): Yadea.
The Chinese company sells more than 6 million electric two-wheelers in more than 80 countries every year. In comparison, America’s biggest electric vehicle (EV) company, Tesla, sold under 2 million units globally last year: 1,789,226 to be precise.
Wuxi-based Yadea recently unveiled four motorcycles at the freshly concluded Motorcycle Live show, with the intention of bringing them all to Europe. The roll-out starts with the UK, thanks to a distribution deal with British tech mobility startup True Enterprises, which will take responsibility for sales and support.
The four Yadea models on display at the expo were the GFX – an entry-level moped, Owin – a no-frills commuter scooter, Velax – a modern-styled urban scooter, and Keeness – a proper electric motorcycle.
Starting with the GFX, it’s a compact e-moped that’s aimed at the micromobility space. It comes with around 30 miles (48 km) of range – although you’d be cruising at a mere 28 mph (45 km/h) top speed.
Of course, it’s not meant to compete with a Kawasaki Ninja ZX10R; rather, it’s meant to get you around the city as an alternative to ebikes, with the ability to haul some stuff around as well, being able to carry around 400 lb (180 kg) of weight around.
Next is the Owin, a rather conventionally styled classic European scooter. It comes with the same top speed as the GFX, but offers a better range of around 50 miles (80 km).
Being more of a classic scooter, you get more space for storage and improved overall comfort. There are also features like cruise control and reverse assist that Yadea offers in the Owin in other markets, but we’re not yet sure if they’ll make their way to the Western models, too.
Then, there’s the more radically styled Velax e-scooter. It comes with the same 50-mile (80 km) range, but it goes considerably faster, with a top speed of 68 mph (110 km/h).
It’s not just better styled but also comes with more torque – 130 lb.ft (176 Nm) compared to Owin’s 92 lb.ft (125 Nm). Hardware gets a bump, too. For instance, there are disc brakes front and back compared to a disc/drum brake setup on the Owin.
The top offering here is the Keeness – the only motorcycle among all four EVs that Yadea is launching in the UK. You get the same 68 mph (110 km/h top speed), but there’s far more range on offer: 80 miles (128 km).
It's powered by a 7-kW mid-drive motor that delivers around 221 lb.ft (300 Nm) of torque. The bike rolls on 17-inch tires, which Yadea claims are “puncture resistant,” and comes with features like app-based anti-theft, vehicle movement alert, geo-fencing, GPS tracking, and keyless unlocking.
All of these e-motos come with a two-year warranty, anti-theft tech, removable batteries, GPS tracking, and connectivity as standard. The difficulty with removable batteries is that, compared to traditional EV-charging facilities, battery switching stations are still pricey and lack standardization – but True co-founder and Chairman, Lloyd Miller, told Zag Daily that his company is seeking collaboration opportunities with councils and businesses to roll out supporting infrastructure.
To begin with though, True and Yadea will target both private riders and the fleet and rental segments. The company is already expanding to other markets, starting with Budapest, Milan, Munich, and Zurich, per Yadea’s UK and Europe representative, Peng Liu.
What’s most interesting here is how the company has priced these two-wheelers for now. The GFX is priced at £2,200, the Owin at £2,700, Velax at £3,900, and the Keenes at £5,900 in the UK. That translates to $2,905, $3,566, $5,151, and $7,792 per direct conversion in US Dollars.
So far, there’s no word on a potential US entry. But considering Yadea’s wide range of electric two wheelers, you can never say never.

70,2025-12-05,"This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Alfredo Mercedes, the 27-year-old founder of VU Talent Partners based in Medellín, Colombia. It has been edited for length and clarity.
I'm the founder of VU Talent Partners, and I recently relocated from Orlando to Medellín, Colombia.
I started my career in the Marine Corps Reserve, where I trained as an infantry mortarman. I next worked as an executive recruiter at Daversa Partners, an executive retained search firm for VC portfolio companies, where I specialized in placing executives in cybersecurity and defense technology roles.
I left Daversa in August 2024 for a six-figure role at Defense Unicorns, a Series A defense technology company that delivers AI and open-source capabilities to national security and DoD systems.
Company pivots created uncertainty around my job. I could've moved into a leadership role, but it wasn't aligned with my personal vision. I wanted to build something of my own where people and venture intersect, helping innovative tech founders scale teams that advance democracy and security for real-world problems.
I took a layoff with severance in December. After leaving Defense Unicorns, I was unsure of my next move. Now I run an AI-enabled modular recruiting platform inside a global VC firm.
In January, I was recruited by VU Venture Partners after the GP reached out to reconnect since we had crossed paths years before to launch VU Talent Partners, where I lead today. Our goal is to eliminate the chaos of scaling by building talent infrastructure that scales with startups.
I had built a reputation in defense and frontier tech recruiting. VU Venture Partners came with a unique proposition: Instead of building another search firm, what if we built a talent platform born inside the fund, powered by the same data and signals on which startups rely?
It helped that VU Venture Partners was also a perfect fit, as I was a graduate of the Venture University Accelerator, and VU Venture Partners is an early-stage global venture capital fund.
I'm the founder and CEO, which comes with a 50/50 split of ownership and profit. I run the VU Talent Partners platform on a day-to-day basis, while the VC provides capital, infrastructure, and network leverage.
First, I had a personal runway. I received rental income from my house in Orlando, which I own, and I lowered my living costs by relocating to Medellín, Colombia, and giving myself some breathing room.
Living in Medellín, Colombia, is more affordable in almost every aspect of cost of living, including rent, transportation, food, and entertainment. I live in a two-story penthouse in the main district area for $1,200 a month. Groceries delivered to my house in 30 minutes cost $40. Ubering anywhere in the city costs $10.
Second, I felt the market demand. Startups are scaling leaner, and venture firms are struggling with refreshed talent sourcing. As AI became a capacity multiplier, I felt recruiting infrastructure and speed to outcomes were missing pieces, especially.
Third, I knew I would be a unique fit. With my military experience, executive recruiting expertise, and startup operator skill set, I knew I could deliver results confidently.
My story is about building a life centered on ownership, resilience, and alignment. The Corps taught me grit. Recruiting taught me leverage. Venture taught me scale. AI is teaching me code.
At 27, I'm focused and still learning, all while creating a people-first infrastructure that outlasts me by helping teams scale talent, not overhead.

71,2025-12-05,"Canadian tech startup Cohere's CEO Aidan Gomez said on Thursday the U.S. and Canada hold an ""incredible position"" to partner with economies adopting AI..."

Catching up to the steep decline in the price of Strategy (MSTR), Cantor Fitzgerald's Brett Knoblauch cut his 12-month price target for Strategy (MSTR) to $229 from $560, citing a weaker environment for raising capital tied to bitcoin BTC$89,488.68. 
The new target still suggests nearly 30% upside from the current price of $180, with Knoblauch maintaining his overweight rating.
Strategy has built its business model around raising money via common stock, preferred stock and convertible debt offerings, and using the cash to buy more bitcoin. The flywheel worked wonderfully for years, propelling MSTR to eye-popping returns since its first bitcoin purchase in 2020. Over the past year, though, investors have been less willing to value Strategy at a high premium to its bitcoin stack. Combined with bitcoin's lame price performance, that's sent MSTR lower by about 70% from its peak in late 204.
Cantor now calculates Strategy’s fully adjusted market net asset value (mNAV) at just 1.18x — still a premium but down from the far higher levels of the past. This constrains Michael Saylor and team from raising money through what would now potentially be dilutive sales of common stock.
Knoblauch thus slashed his forecast for Strategy’s annual capital market proceeds to $7.8 billion from $22.5 billion. The value assigned to Strategy’s treasury operations — essentially, how much potential upside it can capture by raising capital and buying bitcoin — fell from $364 per share to just $74.
Still, Knoblauch hasn’t given up on the firm. “This is a function of both falling bitcoin prices and lower multiples,” he wrote in his Friday note. While he sees the current market as a headwind, his overweight rating signals confidence that the strategy could work again if bitcoin prices recover and investor appetite for leveraged exposure returns.

That view was echoed in a separate note from Mizuho, which took a more optimistic stance on Strategy’s short-term financial position. Following a $1.44 billion equity raise, the firm has built a cash reserve large enough to cover 21 months of preferred stock dividends. Analysts Dan Dolev and Alexander Jenkins said this gives Strategy the flexibility to hold its position without needing to sell bitcoin.

At a recent event hosted by Mizuho, CFO Andrew Kang outlined a cautious approach to future fundraising. He said the firm has no plans to refinance its convertible debt before the first maturity in 2028. Instead, it will rely on preferred equity, which gives it access to capital while preserving its bitcoin holdings.

Kang also made clear that the firm will only return to issuing new equity when its mNAV climbs above 1 — a signal that the market once again values its bitcoin exposure at a premium. If that doesn’t happen, and capital becomes harder to raise, bitcoin sales could be considered, though only as a last resort.

The company appears to be taking a page from its 2022 playbook, when it paused bitcoin purchases during a market downturn and resumed buying once conditions improved. Analysts say this strategy — staying patient and liquid — could help Strategy navigate the current slump.

Govee had great deals on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but those sales are over now. However the company just put this TV backlight (3 Lite model) on sale for a short time, bringing the price down to $58, down from $89, which is the lowest price we’ve ever seen, matching the best Black Friday price. Amazon shows that 10% of stock has already moved, and these flash sales typically disappear fast once word gets out.
This lighting system fixes the problem of wanting immersive bias lighting that changes color with what’s on screen instead of just glowing a static color behind your TV. The camera-based sync technology reads what’s on your screen and projects those colors onto the wall behind your TV. This makes the room feel more inviting and makes movies and games more immersive.
See at Amazon
The camera on top of your TV records what’s on the screen and analyzes it in real time to figure out what colors should be on each part of the LED strip. Traditional ambient lighting systems have trouble being accurate because cameras distort the images they take, especially at the edges where fish-eye warping makes it hard to tell what color it is.
This model has built-in fish-eye correction which means that the camera applies inverse distortion to the image it takes before it analyzes colors. This means that the lighting matches what is happening on screen instead of showing vague approximations: You can see this more clearly in scenes with clear color zones, like a sunset on one side of the screen and dark shadows on the other.
The RGBICW LED setup has red, green, blue, independent cool white, and warm white chips in each lamp bead. This lets you choose from four different colors for each segment along the strip. This multi-chip design makes the system better at making whites and pastels than RGB-only strips, which make white by mixing red, green, and blue at full brightness. The separate white chips also let you use these lights as functional bias lighting with the right white temperatures when you’re not watching something that needs color sync. The 11.8-foot length is long enough to cover 55-65 inch TVs with enough strip to run along three sides of the display which makes the wrap-around effect without the need for complicated multi-strip installations.
It takes about 15 to 20 minutes to set up: You just have to clean the back of your TV, stick the LED strip along the edges, put the camera on top of the display, and plug everything into the adapter that comes with it. To accurately detect colors, the camera needs to be able to see your whole screen clearly. So, you should place it in the middle and make sure that soundbars or other equipment don’t block it.
You can also control the lights through the Govee Home app if you have Wi-Fi: The app lets you choose from different scene modes, colors, and sync sensitivity settings that change how quickly the lights respond to changes on the screen. You can turn down the reactivity during fast-paced action scenes that would otherwise cause distracting strobing effects, or turn up the sensitivity for subtler content where you want even small color changes to show up in the ambient lighting.
In addition to screen sync, the system has several preset modes: These include music sync, which changes colors to the beat of the music, static colors for ambient lighting, and scene modes that are meant for certain moods or activities. In music mode, your phone’s microphone picks up beats and rhythms and makes lights that react to the sound in the room. These other modes make the strip useful for more than just watching movies.
This $31 discount is 34% off which means that premium TV bias lighting is now in the impulse-buy range, where you can try it without making a big financial commitment. For less than the cost of basic RGB strips that don’t have any sync features, you get camera-based screen sync with fish-eye correction, RGBICW color capabilities, and smart home integration.

Zhang Jianzhong, founder of Moore Threads Technology, has joined the billionaire ranks as shares of his Chinese AI chipmaker soared over 420% on its Shanghai market debut amid optimism it could one day become the Nvidia of China. 
The 59-year-old chairman and CEO of the Beijing-based firm has amassed a fortune of $4.3 billion based on his stake in the company, according to Forbes estimates. Moore Threads raised 8 billion yuan ($1.1 billion) in late November by selling 70 million shares at 114.28 yuan apiece, according to its prospectus.  
The company did not respond to a request for comment. The initial public offering is one of the most anticipated in China this year – with the retail portion of the share sale being oversubscribed by 2,750 times despite a clawback mechanism that eventually allotted more shares to individual investors. Moore Threads now sports a market capitalization of 276 billion yuan and plans to use the proceeds for hiring as well as research and development.
Before its blockbuster IPO, Moore Threads raised funding from a star-studded list of investors including HSG (HongShan Capital Group, formerly known as Sequoia China) as well as the investment arms of Chinese tech giants ByteDance and Tencent. In 2023, it was added to the U.S. government’s entity list, a trade blacklist that prevents it from accessing advanced American chipmaking technologies.
The company is benefiting from China’s push for technology self-reliance amid U.S. restrictions on selling advanced semiconductors to its top geopolitical rival, Kenny Ng, a Hong Kong-based securities strategist at Everbright Securities International, says via WeChat messages. Growing optimism over locally made chips has also vaulted the shares of companies including Cambricon Technologies. Chen Tianshi, Cambricon’s 40-year-old chairman and CEO, is now China’s 11th richest person with a net worth of $23.4 billion, according to Forbes' Real-Time Billionaires List.
As for Moore Threads, its products range from graphics processing units to supporting software to train AI models. The domestic market for such GPUs will grow to 1.3 trillion yuan in 2029 from 142.5 billion yuan in 2024, according to a November research note from Shanghai-based brokerage Sinolink Securities.
Moore Threads is likely to become an “important force” in replacing overseas suppliers such as Nvidia, the brokerage wrote in the note. During the first nine months of this year, sales at the company soared 182% year-on-year to 784.6 million yuan. Its loss narrowed to 723.5 million yuan, down 18.7% from the same period a year ago. 
Founder Zhang has worked in the semiconductor business for almost 20 years. He led Nvidia’s China unit for 14 years until 2020, the same year he founded Moore Threads, according to the prospectus. The mogul previously worked as a senior executive at Dell and HP in China, its prospectus shows. His wife, Liu Shanshan, was a company director during its early years before stepping down in 2023."
76,2025-12-05,"Strategy’s (MSTR) senior perpetual preferred stock, STRF, is increasingly standing out as the company’s most successful credit instrument since its launch in March. 
Trading at $110, STRF has risen 36% from issuance and has rebounded 20% from its Nov. 21 low of $92. That date also marked bitcoin’s local bottom near $80,000, highlighting the strong correlation between STRF and bitcoin. 
STRF occupies the top tier of Strategy’s preferred structure. It pays a fixed 10% annual cash dividend and features governance rights plus penalty based step ups if payments are missed. Even with its premium pricing pushing the effective yield down to about 9.03%, demand remains strong due to the security’s senior protections and long duration credit profile.
In late October, executive chairman Michael Saylor highlighted a growing credit spread between STRF and the junior STRD. The spread measures the extra yield investors demand to hold higher risk junior securities, which is now at 12.5%. At the Nov. 21 low, that differential widened to an all time high of 1.5 as investors crowded into senior exposure, STRD was trading as low as $65. The spread has since normalized to around 1.3.
Divergence is now visible across Strategy’s preferred suite. STRC, has seen four dividend rate increases to sustain investor interest. 
Strategy’s equity has also rebounded, climbing from a Dec 1 low of $155 to about $185, reflecting improved sentiment across both the company’s balance sheet and the bitcoin market since announcing a $1.44 billion cash buffer resevere for the preferred dividend payments.

Samsung Android Rumors

To Exynos or not to Exynos, that is the question for Samsung's upcoming Galaxy S26 series. And, additionally, where to Exynos? We've heard tons of reports already saying many different things - either only the S26 and S26+ will get the soon to be revealed Exynos 2600 SoC, or maybe the Ultra too, but only in some regions.
Today a new rumor muddies the waters even more, claiming that all three S26 models will indeed use the Exynos 2600, but only in one market: Korea. We have to say we're very skeptical about this claim, since Samsung has in the past also brought Exynos S-series devices to Europe.
Anyway, the story is that Samsung has apparently noted the hatred its Exynos chips get online across the world, and the seeming preference everyone has for Snapdragon chips. On top of that, the company's contract with Qualcomm allegedly stipulates that at least 75% of all Galaxy S26, S26+, and S26 Ultra units sold globally have to use the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 SoC, or else Samsung will have to pay a very high amount as compensation.
Furthermore, the Exynos 2600 yield is said to not be ideal yet, although yields are improving faster for its 2nm GAA process than they did for 3nm processes in the past, so even if it wanted to, Samsung may not be able to equip more S26 units with its own chip. We wouldn't take any of this for granted, though - surely tomorrow another rumor will come and contradict at least part of this. That is after all how things have been going on this front lately.
Source (in Chinese)
Don't see the point of getting sd 8 elite gen 5. Soc is terrible, throttling like a volcano. Dont know about this exynos, but i would opt for dimensity 9500.
That's not a bad tactic, if the Koreans don't mind, to test the waters. 
Anyway, Samsung has to prove its chip in a flagship killer like S26 FE or something and THEN use the next one, when it really can compete.
Definitely not Korea. It's Europe.

Geoff KeighleyThe Game Awards 
For one night in 2005, the Mojave Desert glowed green. Microsoft inexplicably launched its then-new console, the Xbox 360, with a release event in a hangar in the desert. A Microsoft executive told Gizmodo in 2005 that it was supposed to resemble Burning Man, the art festival where Silicon Valleyâs rich reenact the prelude to a BioShock game.. Another executive called it an “Xbox 360 oasis.” Journalists and Xbox fansâit was both a press event and a player launch partyâlounged on beanbags to play the hottest new console at one of dozens of stations. Microsoft served alcohol from paneled domes that are now synonymous with covid-era outdoor dining.
These sorts of big budget gaming events, where companies spared no expense on luring press and fans into weird placesâall in the name of promoting new hardware or gamesâdon’t exist much anymore. But 20 years later, an artifact channeling that bygone era has reemerged, once again, this time in the Colorado desert: a mysterious demonic statue with the bodies of the damned etched into its sides.
The Game Awards overseer Geoff Keighley posted a photo of the mysterious statue with a geocode pointing people to an area of Joshua Tree National Park, just off of Yucca Mesa Road. Tendrils glow red from the statue at night, illuminating the screaming skeletons of both humans and creatures. Several people who’ve visited the statue have posted about it on social media and Reddit. Apparently, a security guard watches over the relicâ”cool dude,” according to Reddit user TautSexyElfKingâand the statue makes sounds. Another person instructed others to knock on the door, saying something else will knock back.
“It was very ambient and hellish sounding,” TautSexyElfKing said. “Almost like it was a doorway and on the other side was a large cavern with demons lurking about the other side. Maybe some light growling-ish sounds. There wasn’t anything I could make out in particular that would be a hint or anything”
To the unaware, it looks like the kind of thing you might find at Burning Man, or maybe an altar for worshipping the devil. But Keighley’s post is a signal to gamers that this is an Easter eggâa marketing stunt. It’s working, not because it’s hyping people up for any specific game or console, but because it’s pushing people toward Keighley’s pride and joy: an end of year bash produced, owned, and hosted by the man himself.
The statue itself is ambiguous enough that spectators can map it onto whateverâs at the top of their Game Awards World Premier wishlist. It’s off Yucca Mesa Road, so it must be for Half-Life 3. The demonic symbols are an obvious reference to Diablo 4‘s next expansion. No, waitâmaybe that’s God of War. It’s essentially a hell portal, which clearly means Doom. I don’t know, maybe Elder Scrolls 6? Or, perhaps, Keighley is simply himself opening a portal to hell and intends to destroy the whole dang world.Â 
no one is considering that Geoff is simply opening a hell portal https://t.co/XKEgj6N3e6

Apparently everyone is wrong, according to Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier, who said it’s not Diablo 4 or Elder Scrolls 6. “I don’t currently plan on reporting what it is, sorry, but it’s a good one,â he wrote on a gaming forum. â Regardless of the answer, The Game Awards winsâthe statue has gotten enough buzz that people will, certainly, tune in to see what the statue is teasing.
It’s a little more easily digestible than, say, the Frog Fractions 2 ARG that went unsolved for literally two years spanning nearly two dozen games on Steam and a book in a California library. Then there’s the Halo 2 ARG called I Love Bees, which spanned three months, jars of honey, and several pay phones,Â  or when Electronic Arts launched copies of Mass Effect 3 into space using weather balloons. (The people who found the copies, inevitably plummeting back to earth, could play the game early.)
Keighley’s Game Awards statue doesn’t seem to necessarily be an alternate reality game. It’s hard to say if it’s really leaving any clues for gamers to decode or just there to power the hype cycle. It feels more aligned with the chaotic churn of algorithmic virality that everyone’s seeking these daysâa weird thing in a weird place, easily photographed or videotaped and circulated on TikTok, Reddit, and elsewhere. It’s working.Â 
Companies have done these sorts of things for highly-anticipated, big budget games like Overwatch (big action figures in big boxes), God of War (big axe in London), and Horizon Forbidden West (big mechanical monsters). The difference, of course, is that it’s obvious what these installations were promoting. The danger in the Game Awards statue is that people will end up let down by whatever game it’s tied to.
Events like The Game Awards were born to market AAA games; Keighley fills the show with commercials for the latest and greatest big-budget blockbusters from the industry’s mega-companies, backed by a booming voice boasting a world premiere announcement or new gameplay trailer. The biggest of these, games like The Witcher 4 or Marvelâs Wolverine, barely need the extra eye-balls while everything else gets lost in the shuffle. Homegrown debut hits like Balatro and Expedition 33: Clair Obscure, meanwhile, come out of nowhere and dominate the zeitgeist without the help of giant marketing machines. While some companies hope to manufacture a fraction of that cachet with big showcase moments, itâs no longer obvious that theyâre for sale. To hear some tell it, the old AAA gaming model has reached âthe end of days.â Weâre a long way from cosplaying Area 51 for a midnight console launch.Â 
But I suppose that’s not Keighley’s problem. People might not remember whatever the statue ends up being for but theyâll tune into The Game Award to find out. He gets to hype his show either way.

Netflix is buying Warner Bros. Discovery's studio and streaming businesses in a seismic $72 billion deal that promises to shake up Hollywood.
The Netflix-WBD tie-up, which the companies announced on Friday morning, would be the industry's largest since Disney bought 21st Century Fox for $71 billion in 2019. Netflix is planning to buy HBO Max and the top-performing Warner Bros. studio, but not WBD's TV networks like CNN, TNT, and TBS.
Netflix must first secure regulatory approval from the US and foreign governments, which some media analysts say could be a challenge. If all goes as planned, the deal is set to close in 12 to 18 months, the companies said.
Netflix beat out Paramount Skydance and Comcast in a bidding war.
Since Netflix is only buying the Warner Bros. studio and HBO Max, the remaining TV assets that are seen as less valuable will be spun out, as WBD originally planned. WBD was formed in April 2022 after a merger between AT&T's WarnerMedia and Discovery.
""In the coming days, we will establish an Integration Office, which will coordinate all planning with Netflix, consistent with regulatory requirements,"" WBD CEO David Zaslav wrote in a note to employees on Friday. ""Until the transaction closes, WBD and Netflix remain separate companies. It may be tempting to reach out directly to counterparts or former colleagues at Netflix, but it is essential that all interactions are managed through this office to ensure we meet every legal and regulatory obligation.""
Here's the full memo that Zaslav sent employees on Friday morning:

NetflixWarner Bros 
Netflix is bidding over $80 billion to buy Warner Bros., and it’s probably not doing it for the games. But the company will still come away with a ton of them if the merger goes through. Warner Bros. Games is one of the few major publishers left in the U.S. following years of big acquisition deals. What might be closer to a rounding error relative to the larger movie and TV portfolio still marks a huge shift for the industry. And Netflix’s incredibly chaotic fumbling of gaming over the last several years raises some alarm bells.
The king of streaming confirmed during a conference call presentation about the newly revealed deal that games would be part of the transaction, but never discussed them outright. Instead, they were relegated to the smallest square on a presentation slide outlining the various components of the merger. They were lumped in with “Games & Consumer Product & Experiences” alongside much bigger brands like HBO, DC, Harry Potter, and Superman.
Even with its massive success, the best-selling game of 2023, Hogwarts Legacy, was clearly nowhere close to top-of-mind for Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters. The open-world wizarding game already has a sequel in development at Avalanche Software, and it’s supposed to have some level of crossover with the upcoming HBO Harry Potter reboot. The first Hogwarts Legacy sold over 30 million copies. In revenue terms at least, that puts it way ahead of the global box office for something like James Gunn’s first Superman movie.
Then there’s TT Games, the UK-based maker of the recent hit Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga. It announced a new adaptation of Batman earlier this year called Lego Batman: The Legacy of the Dark Knight, which acts as a best-of sizzle reel for the comic book hero’s peak movie moments in an Arkham-style open world. There’s no release date yet, but it seems likely to arrive sometime in 2026. If it’s anything like the Skywalker Saga, it’ll be another top-seller.
Netflix will also become the new home of Mortal Kombat. While a new movie launches next year, fans have been waiting for NeatherRealms to return to the DC universe with Injustice 3. The studio announced earlier this year that it was done shipping new DLC for 2023’s Mortal Kombat 1 and would switch to focusing on its “next project” instead. Unless Ed Boon’s team is quietly at work on a completely new cross-over fighting game, a return to the alternate DC universe where Superman is bad still seems like the safest bet.
After that, things at Warner Bros. Games start to get really messy, thanks to years of seemingly short-sighted and chaotic executive decisions. Rocksteady Studios, once the team behind premier blockbusters like Batman: Arkham City and Batman: Arkham Knight, has been licking its wounds after the dismal failure of last year’s live service spin-off, Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League. Encouraged by publisher leadership despite misgivings from the studio floor, the multiplayer loot shooter lost over $200 million, according to Bloomberg.
The studio is reportedly back to focusing on the Arkham franchise that made it famous, but a new entry would still be years away during a time when AAA development is more expensive and precarious than ever. Earlier this year, Warner Bros. Games took an ax to many of its other studios, including MultiVersus maker Player First Games, WB San Diego, which was making a free-to-play AAA game, and Monolith Productions, which was working on a long-in-development adaptation of Wonder Woman. The latter had a storied history, including developing the Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor series, but lost key leadership after it was forced to pivot from a new IP to adapting Wonder Woman.
All of this turmoil resulted in publishing head David Haddad being fired from Warner Bros. Games after a decade-plus tenure. The game division’s struggles may have also been compounded by whip-lash from above, amid Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav’s ongoing whirlwind tour through the unraveling conglomerate. Despite casually trampling on marketing plans by revealing projects early during investor calls, Zaslav never seemed to be interested in providing Warner Bros. Games with a clear mission or mandate other than “help make stock price go up.”
News of the sale might be more reassuring if Netflix management didn’t seem equally at a loss when it comes to games. The streamer snatched up a bunch of small studios, including notable indie darlings like Oxenfree maker Night School Studio and Cozy Grove maker Spry Fox over the years. It loaded up its mobile app with tons of critically-acclaimed games from Hades to The Rise of the Golden Idol. It sought big-name additions like the GTA Trilogy Remastered. It even plunged ahead with an AAA studio called Team Blue that pulled veterans fromÂ Overwatch,Â Halo, andÂ God of War.
But despite bundling top games with its standard subscription service, almost nobody played them. It started abandoning indie game deals, cutting resources, and quietly shuttered its AAA team last year. Just this week, Netflix announced it was selling off Spry Fox, which it bought only three years ago, though the ambitious 3D Studio-Ghibli-meets-Animal-Crossing-chillfest called Spirit Crossing will remain in development. Instead, the company’s big focus moving forward will be party games and quick-turn-around licensed junk for its biggest streaming hits like Squid Games and Bridgerton. It’s the latest example of a tech company racing into gaming and falling flat on its face.
So where does that leave Warner Bros. Games and its checkered portfolio of major games and studios? It’s hard to say. In some ways, it complements all of the areas of gaming where Netflix has already failed or retreated. It may not be high up on the list of synergies, but maybe the possibility of an eventual Lego Stranger Things anthology is still part of the streaming platform’s overall ambitions for the merger. Or maybe gaming, and AAA blockbuster gaming in particular, is so peripheral to Netflix’s broader business that Warner Bros. Gaming will find itself in an even more precarious position.
Giant acquisitions are rarely as neat and tidy in practice as they appear on paper or in a PowerPoint presentation, even in the best of times, let alone when they’re thrown together in the midst of bidding wars, tumultuous legacy media transformations, and a race toward industry consolidation in order to achieve monopoly pricing power. The only thing worse is the alternatives: the Bari Weis network, Microsoft, or Saudi Arabia aren’t great options either.

83,2025-12-05,"India's travel chaos has worsened after the country's largest airline IndiGo cancelled hundreds of scheduled flights on Friday after three days of widespread disruption across its network.
The carrier, which has a 60% market share in India and flies more than 2,000 flights a day, has been facing pilot shortages after it failed to adapt to new crew rostering rules.
Thousands of passengers are stranded across India in what's a busy travel season, with all IndiGo flights from the capital Delhi cancelled.
IndiGo has said operations will return to full normalcy only by 10 February, and has sought temporary relief on the new rules that call for more rest hours and restricted night-duty.
The airline has also said it will reduce its flight operations to minimise disruptions from 8 December. 
The government has said it is closely monitoring the situation with the federal aviation minister expressing ""clear displeasure"" with how the airline had handled the situation. 
In a separate statement, India's aviation regulator said the disruptions were primarily on account of ""misjudgment and planning gaps"" in implementing the new flight duty time limitation rules. 
The regulator has directed IndiGo to submit a detailed plan on crew recruitment,  training, roster restructuring, safety-risk assessments and other mitigation measures with immediate effect.
Local media reports say IndiGo has been granted a waiver from the new pilot rest rules, and the ban on combining pilot leave with weekly rest has been eased to stabilise operations. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this.
But the airline has attracted sharp criticism from the Airline Pilots Association of India, which said any relief granted to the airline on duty timings undermines the spirit of the new regulations and ""gravely"" compromises the safety of the flying public. 
Under the new rules pilots are given more rest, with one of the major changes mandating pilots to make two night-time landings per week, down from six under the old rules.
December is a busy travel month in India, when school holidays and the peak wedding season gets under way. 
IndiGo has said it will waive off all cancellation/reschedule requests for travel between 5 and 15 December. It is also arranging for hotel rooms and food for passengers whose travel has been disrupted. 
But several passengers have taken to social media, expressing anger about not being given up-to-date information and remaining stranded at the airport without food. 
Singapore's High Commissioner to India Simon Wong said he was ""lost for words"" as he joined the thousands stranded at the airport, having to miss the wedding of his young staff member. 
Major airports in Delhi, Mumbai and other cities have issued advisories asking passengers to check the status of their flights before heading to the airport.

84,2025-12-05," Bitcoin miners face record margin pressure as proxy stocks sink, Kalshi lands $1B funding and Ether derivatives volumes overtake Bitcoin on CME. 
Bitcoin (BTC) miners are learning the hard way that “number go up” doesn’t always trickle down. Even with Bitcoin prices still elevated by historical standards, mining margins have been sharply squeezed, with some industry analysts describing the current climate as the “harshest margin environment” on record. Balance sheets are shrinking, leverage is being reduced, and companies such as CleanSpark are moving to pay down Bitcoin-backed credit lines.
The strain is spilling into public markets. Bitcoin miners and other BTC “proxy” trades have come under heavy pressure, highlighted by the collapse in shares of American Bitcoin.
Not every corner of the market is retreating, however. Capital is flowing into crypto-adjacent platforms, with prediction market Kalshi recently raising $1 billion at an $11-billion valuation after a tenfold increase in trading volumes since 2024, overtaking Polymarket.
Meanwhile, Ether is gaining traction in derivatives markets. CME Group reports that Ether (ETH) futures volumes have recently surpassed those tied to Bitcoin, reflecting rising options volatility and growing trader interest.
This week’s Crypto Biz examines the intensifying pressure on Bitcoin miners, the surge in Ethereum derivatives activity and Kalshi’s blockbuster funding round.
Renewed volatility in the Bitcoin market has pushed mining economics into the “harshest margin environment of all time,” according to TheMinerMag, which cited structurally low mining revenues driven by falling hash prices, rising operating costs and equipment payback periods stretching beyond 1,000 days as key warning signs.
“Balance sheets are retracting” in response to the worsening economics, the publication said, pointing specifically to CleanSpark’s decision to fully repay its Bitcoin-backed credit line with Coinbase as an example of miners moving to reduce financial risk.
Bitcoin mining stocks have remained volatile in 2025 as the industry continues to adjust to the revenue shock from last year’s Bitcoin halving, which cut mining rewards in half. At the same time, many miners are pivoting toward AI and high-performance computing workloads in an effort to secure more stable, predictable revenue than Bitcoin mining alone can provide.
Shares of American Bitcoin, a mining and digital asset treasury company associated with Eric Trump, plummeted more than 50% in a single trading session this week, underscoring the extreme volatility still affecting crypto-linked equities.
The stock lost roughly half its value shortly after the market opened Tuesday, extending a broader sell-off across Bitcoin mining stocks and other so-called crypto “proxy” trades that has intensified since Bitcoin pulled back from its October high.
American Bitcoin shares are now down more than 75% from their post-listing high of $9.31, reached shortly after the company began trading publicly through a reverse merger with Gryphon Mining. The steep decline underscores growing investor caution toward speculative crypto equities as Bitcoin prices and mining economics come under pressure.
Prediction market Kalshi has raised $1 billion at an $11-billion valuation, signaling a renewed interest in event-based trading among investors.
The Series E funding round followed Kalshi’s strongest month on record for trading activity and was led by crypto-focused venture firm Paradigm, with participation from Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital and ARK Invest.
Kalshi’s trading volume reached $4.54 billion in November, surpassing its previous all-time high, according to industry data. The company stated that its trading activity has grown tenfold since 2024, surpassing rivals such as Polymarket to become the largest prediction market by volume.
CME Group has reported a sharp rise in Ether futures trading activity, with volumes recently surpassing those of Bitcoin options. The exchange said the surge may reflect a catch-up trade or the early stages of a broader Ether “super-cycle.”
In a recent video, CME executive Priyanka Jain stated that ETH options are currently exhibiting higher volatility than Bitcoin options, a shift that appears to be attracting increased speculative and hedging activity.
“This heightened volatility has served as a powerful magnet for traders, directly accelerating participation in CME Group’s Ether futures,” Jain said. “Is this Ether’s long-awaited super-cycle, or merely a catch-up trade driven by short-term volatility?”
Earlier this week, the CME Group launched a new Bitcoin Volatility Index, along with several additional cryptocurrency benchmarks, providing traders with standardized pricing and volatility reference data.

I had a plan. I was going to build my own version of Valveâs Steam Machine using traditional PC parts, then stuff it all into my childhood PC case installed with SteamOS for the ultimate combination of convenience and nostalgia. But I waited too long. The price of RAM has skyrocketed so highÂ that even previous-generation PC components are now sitting at two, three, or four times as much as they were only two months ago. Building any size PC is more untenable than even back during the pandemic-era GPU shortage. Gamers everywhere are looking for an alternative to play their PC game library, andâunfortunatelyâone of the last remaining avenues demands a less-expensive-but-still-pricey cloud gaming subscription.
My original plan was to heap my PC full of hand-me-down, used, and last-gen parts to get the best deal I could. Currently, even older selections of DDR4 RAM sticks as small as 16GB cost close to $110, whereas the same component sat at $50 as recently as September. Newer DDR5 sticks now cost five times as much. And itâs only going to get worse. On Wednesday, Micron, which owns the major DRAM (dynamic random access memory) brand Crucial, announced it made the âdifficult decisionâ to kill its consumer-facing brand altogether. Sumit Sadana, Micronâs chief business officer, made it clear this was to focus on fulfilling the insatiable demand for memory from AI data centers.
Micron held 25.7% of the DRAM market share by the time it exited the scene, according to TrendForce data. The next biggest player, Nanya, held 1.1%. There are few scenarios where this doesnât impact the price of computer parts even more. So where does that leave gamers who were too late upgrading their PC or who find they need new hardware to play their games? I hate to say it, but there are options for those with solid home internet connections and a willingness to remain beholden to a subscription service.
Last month, Xbox claimed the number of playtime hours on its Game Pass Cloud Gaming service was up 45% year over year. That 45% comes specifically from cloud streaming on consoles, but the service was seeing 26% more playtime on âother devices.â Xbox didnât break down how big a portion âother devicesâ made up PC, or perhaps former PC gamers. Earlier this year, Xbox raised the price of its Game Pass Ultimate subscription from $20 to $30 a month. At the same time, it gave access to cloud gaming for people spending $15 or $10 for lower tiers on select titles. The service can now stream games up to 1440p resolutions as well.
The uptick in playtime may be related to recent games like Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 coming out on Game Pass, though that canât be the whole story. Gamers are looking for the best deal, and even a more expensive subscription service will be far cheaper than high-end 64GB RAM that costs close to $800 from some brands. For PC gamers who want to play their own games, the other option is to pay for GeForce Now. Nvidia recently updated its subscription service to enable some games to run on a more recent Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 GPU instead of an older RTX 4080 Super or RTX 4080. You have to pay $20 a month to access that feature as well as 4K streaming.
Not all games will run on the RTX 5080. Nvidia has added more over time; most recently titles like Enshrouded and Fallout 76. Nvidia also lets subscribers play a few extra games that donât appear on GeForce Nowâs supported list through the Install-to-Play feature. You can rent out extra server space for a few more bucks a month to have instantaneous access to those games.
Iâve used both Game Pass and GeForce Now extensively enough to know that streaming is not a 1-to-1 replacement for a PC. Even with fast internet speeds and low latency, there is a distinct difference in visual quality between games that are rendered on-device and those streamed over the internet, even at 1440p or 4K. Anybody who used to be a native PC gamer will recognize the quality difference after a mere few minutes of play. And PC gamers are rarely the type to accept such tradeoffs.
These PC component price hikes will inevitably price out some gamers. While we hope that weâll see more relatively inexpensive (though still costly) PC gaming devices like the Steam Machine, we canât hold out hope that gaming-ready laptops wonât demand extra cost.
Crucial was busy posting ads for its gaming-ready SSDs (solid state drives) as recently as the day prior to the companyâs announcement. Events are moving fast, and we wonât have time to blink before the news gets worse. Market analyst firm TrendForce reported Micron was the number three DRAM supplier in the world, behind SK Hynix and Samsung. Those two companies are similarly retooling their business to focus on making memory for AI data centers. Transcend, another major consumer-end memory maker, wrote to customers in a notice shared online that Samsung and Sandisk delayed their latest shipments of NAND, which is used for flash memory. Transcend has been without NAND supply since October.

These major tech brands have hinted the run on DRAM prices may last well past 2028. Korean language news site Hankyung reported Samsung and SK Hynix are both imagining their focus on AI data centers will last through the start of 2028. That sounds like magical thinking, but it shows just how willing memory makers are to leave the PC industry in the cold. Which means the consumer is going to need some alternatives, and soon.

The only top 6 OEM to record 0% shipment increase year-on-year.
Reading time: 2 minutes
Despite restructuring its premium tablet lineup last year, Samsung hasn't seen much shipment growth in Q3 2025. The Korean tech giant couldn't make a dent in Apple's iPad in the third quarter, and shipments stagnated.

Samsung held onto 2nd place in terms of global tablet shipments, but its year-on-year growth didn't look so good. Five of its rivals increased shipments, but Samsung's remained the same.

In terms of global shipment market share, Apple covered 34% of the tablet market and increased shipments by 4% year-on-year.

Samsung's shipment share year-on-year dropped by 1%, and its overall shipment growth stagnated (via Counterpoint Research).

Rivals like Lenovo, Huawei, Amazon, and Xiaomi have also more or less maintained a similar shipment market share, but they were all able to ship more units in Q3 2025 at the cost of shipments from other brands, which dropped 7%.

The Galaxy Z TriFold is a pure hybrid device that combines the Galaxy phone and tablet experience into one. When unfolded, the TriFold offers the same experience as a premium Galaxy tablet. It even runs DeX on-device, becoming the first phone to do so.

But is it really a phone? It's a hybrid. And it will be interesting to see if TriFold sales and shipments will count as tablet sales and shipments in the future.

Either way, the Galaxy Z TriFold will be released in very few markets, so it won't help Samsung push its market share by much either way.

However, the future could look very different once the TriFold or its sequel goes on sale globally. It might be what Samsung needs to challenge Apple more closely.

97,2025-12-05,"I really wish Gen5 SSDs had become relevant by now, at least for what most people use their PCs for. The current inflated SSD prices aside, Gen5 SSDs just aren't worth the investment if you're a gamer or regular user. Plus, you need to deal with high thermals and giant coolers just to avoid throttling. While Gen4 SSDs seem like the default choice for the majority of users, most people will be just fine even with a Gen3 SSD. If you have one in your PC, there's no rush to upgrade to a faster SSD. If you're in the market for a new drive, that's a different story. 
You might think you need the fastest SSDs on the market, but you probably don't
Gen5 SSDs are mighty impressive when you look at the sequential read/write speeds. After all, around 15,000MB/s transfer speeds are no joke, especially when Gen4 SSDs maxed out at around 7,000MB/s. The doubling of sequential read/write speeds has continued since we moved from Gen3 to Gen4 drives, and high-end Gen5 SSDs have brought things to a whole new level. The thing is, however, that sequential speeds don't move the needle much when it comes to gaming. Since gaming depends on random IOPS (Input/Output Operations per Second), which didn't really see a massive jump when going from Gen3 to Gen5 SSDs, the real-world benefits of blazing-fast SSDs to gaming are pretty slim.
DirectStorage was supposed to make all the extra speed on Gen5 SSDs worth it for gaming, but it hasn't seen much traction outside a few titles. Things might pick up in the near future, but Gen5 drives are basically worthless for now. Besides, these high-end drives tend to run pretty hot, requiring overkill coolers just to keep them from thermal throttling. Considering the thermal overhead, premium pricing, and little to no benefit in gaming or general system responsiveness, Gen5 drives are only really worth it for hardcore professionals.
Your PC might not be ready for the upgrade
You probably already knew that Gen5 SSDs are still ahead of their time, but what about Gen4 drives? Surely, PCIe 4.0 SSDs are completely worth it, right? Well, it turns out most of what you do on your PC doesn't even saturate Gen4 speeds. Whether it's gaming load times, OS boot times, or general system responsiveness, your Gen4 SSD isn't being stressed by the system. If you do a blind test by using a Gen3 and Gen4 SSD system, you won't be able to tell them apart. The jump from hard drives to SATA SSDs, and from SATA drives to Gen3 SSDs, is significant, but everything henceforth represents only a subtle performance jump, at least in most cases.
More than the sequential transfer speeds mentioned on your SSD's product page, what matters more for your perceived experience are features like DRAM and the type of controller on your SSD. A DRAM cache speeds up write-heavy workloads on your PC — think file transfers, video editing, game streaming, and even gaming performance in titles with base building and procedural generation. The SSD's controller also determines a lot of the drive's data transfer performance, latency, and IOPS. You should check third-party reviews to see if the drive you want to buy has a decent controller on it.
Go beyond the obvious when it comes to buying a new SSD
You might think that buying a Gen3 drive is better if you can't see any real-world difference between Gen3 and Gen4 SSDs. It would be if Gen3 SSDs were significantly cheaper than Gen4 models. The latter have been on the market for years, and have become the default for PC users, at least those who build their own rigs. So, cost arbitrage vanished a long time ago. Today, many Gen3 SSDs actually cost more than Gen4 counterparts, making any argument against Gen4 SSDs pointless. If you're building a new PC or buying additional storage, just get a 1TB or 2TB Gen4 NVMe SSD. You don't need to get rid of your existing Gen3 drives, but buying a new PCIe 3.0 drive is pointless now. Besides, a Gen4 drive will benefit you in non-gaming scenarios in the future if you decide to dabble in productivity workloads.
Do some research before spending your hard earned money
For most regular workloads like browsing, launching apps, gaming, and booting the PC, Gen3 SSDs are still just fine. Gen4 SSDs are the sweet spot in terms of performance and price, and can benefit you with certain workloads. Gen5 SSDs are the fastest in terms of sequential speeds, but don't offer much in terms of real-world performance boost. If you're using a Gen3 SSD, there's still no need to upgrade, but if you're buying additional storage, a Gen4 drive is the best choice, unless you can make use of Gen5 speeds for productivity workloads.
