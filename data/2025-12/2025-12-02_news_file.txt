0,2025-12-02,"The Bank of England has warned of a ""sharp correction"" in the value of major tech companies with growing fears of an artificial intelligence (AI) bubble.
It said share prices in the UK are close to the ""most stretched"" they have been since the 2008 global financial crisis, while equity valuations in the US are reminiscent of those before the dotcom bubble burst.
The central bank's financial stability report warned valuations are ""particularly stretched"" for companies focused on AI.
In its report the Bank also announced plans to lower the amount of capital High Street banks need to hold in a bid to boost lending and spur economic growth.
It marks the first reduction in the amount lenders need to hold since the 2008 financial crisis, and followed stress tests showing they would be able to withstand a crisis scenario with unemployment doubling, house prices plummeting and the economy contracting by 5%.
The Bank said the growth of the AI sector in the next five years would be fuelled by trillions of dollars of debt, raising financial stability risks if the value of the companies falls.
It cited industry figures forecasting spending on AI infrastructure could top $5tn (£3.8tn) and said much of this would be funded by AI firms themselves, but around half would come from outside sources, mostly through debt.
""Deeper links between AI firms and credit markets, and increasing interconnections between those firms, mean that, should an asset price correction occur, losses on lending could increase financial stability risks,"" it said.
The Bank of England is the latest institution to sound the alarm over a potential crash in the value of AI firms reminiscent of previous incidents such as the dotcom bubble.
Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of US bank JP Morgan, told the BBC in October he was ""far more worried than others"" about the risk of a serious market correction in the coming years. 
The International Monetary Fund and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development have also warned of price corrections.
The dotcom booms refers to a period in the late 1990s, during which the values of early internet companies surged on a wave of optimism for what was then a new technology, before the bubble burst in early 2000 - with many share prices collapsing.
This led to some companies going bust, resulting in job losses. 
A drop in share prices can also hit the value of people's savings including their pension funds. 
Fears over an AI-related stock market correction come as Chancellor Rachel Reeves used her Budget to encourage savers to pile cash into stocks and shares by reducing the amounts which can be saved in cash Isas. 

Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has previously raised fears about a potential financial crash, warning after the collapse of two US companies that ""alarm bells"" were ringing.
On Tuesday he said the AI sector in the US is ""very concentrated"", making up a large portion of the value of the country's stock market.
But he added: ""There is a difference to the dotcom situation in that these companies have got positive cash flows, they are not created on hope.
""But, as we see, and we saw last week in the debate about whether Google is moving onto Nvidia's patch, it doesn't mean to say everybody is going to win, it doesn't mean to say everyone is going to win equally.
""It is important to be clear it is not inconsistent, quite consistent in fact that AI turns out to be the next general purpose technology in terms of prompting productivity growth across economies. I hope it is, but we'll see.""
The central bank also said the risks to financial stability had risen during 2025, citing geopolitical tensions, global trade wars and rising borrowing costs for governments.
It said growing tension between countries had specifically raised the prospect of cyber-attacks and other disruptions.
After assessing High Street lenders' ability to cope in a crisis situation, the Bank has proposed lowering the benchmark for Tier 1 capital requirements for firms to 13% from the 14% level it has been at since 2015. The requirement refers to the buffer banks must hold in case of any losses from risky lending.
The central bank said this would still give firms a £60bn buffer against their minimum requirements so they would be able to continue lending to households and companies.
The Bank's Financial Policy Committee said lowering the threshold would make it easier for lenders to offer loans to households and businesses. The changes are due to come into force in 2027.
Elsewhere in the financial stability report, the Bank warned homeowners coming off fixed-rate mortgages in the next two years face a £64 increase in their monthly repayments.
The central bank said the typical owner-occupier coming off a fixed rate would see an 8% jump in their bills as the impact of higher interest rates continues to bite.
In total, 3.9 million people, or 43% of mortgage holders, are expected to refinance at higher rates by 2028, the Bank said.
But a third will see their monthly payments fall in that period, it added, with interest rates having fallen significantly since a spike in 2022.
The Bank of England's base rate, which influences the cost of borrowing for individuals, including mortgages, has fallen from 5.25% in 2024 to its current 4%.
In the UK and across Europe, cars are becoming longer, wider and heavier

When Ryan Kelley, the chief investment officer of Hennessy Funds, doles out a couple of stock picks, it's probably a good idea to hear him out. According to Morningstar data, Kelley has beaten 99% of peers over the last five years of managing both the Cornerstone Growth Fund (HFCVX) and the Cornerstone Mid Cap 30 Fund (HFMDX) at Hennessy.
Last week, I asked Kelly where he's seeing the best opportunities right now, and he highlighted a couple of his holdings in the mid-cap fund: Sanmina Corporation (SANM) and Dycom Industries (DY).
They're both iterations on the AI picks-and-shovels play, he said, so as long as hyperscalers continue to spend hundreds of billions on data centers, they should continue to reap significant earnings.
""We still don't know, honestly, if AI is the best thing since sliced bread, but we'll find that out,"" Kelley said. ""In the meantime, we can invest in other parts of the market and other companies that are gonna benefit from this huge buildup.""
Sanmina manufactures the parts needed for data centers and has a market cap of around $8.5 billion.
""They're not making chips, but they're making the server racks, they're building out the systems and the servers and the infrastructure for these mega data centers,"" Kelley said.
The company's recent acquisition of ZT Systems from AMD positions it well in the industry, Kelley said. Plus, he argues it trades at a cheap valuation. Its forward P/E ratio is 35, and while that's on the high end, it's just above the Nasdaq 100's average of 33 despite the stock's 103% rally over the last year.
Dycom, meanwhile, is an electrical construction and engineering company that specializes in installing fiber optic networks.
The stock is up 93% over the last year, putting its market cap at $10.4 billion. Its forward PE ratio is 45.
""We're continuing to need more and more bandwidth, and they're instrumental in that type of buildup,"" Kelley said.
He added: ""That's a secondary or tertiary company that'll benefit from the AI boom regardless … whether or not AI is really as great as it cracked up to be.""

Oh you mean when it went to court and Biden both times respected the courts rulings? That time?
Oh yeah, you don't think Presidents should have to listen to courts! What am I saying?!
""Both sides"" is bullshit.
You will never find Biden-era equivalents of:- Ordering the US military to fire on shipwreck survivors.- Pardoning someone who helped flood the US with cocaine.- Pardoning a hedge-fund manager who fleeced families out of millions.
And these are examples from just the last couple of weeks.
 Republicans didn't weaponize the courts and start firing off 100 court orders a week by judges using clown logic eitherUhhh James Comey, Hunter Biden, Ann Selzer and I could rattle off another dozen or two that might have a disagreement with that statement.

Also hold on, this is even more ridiculous then at first glance.  You lead off with talking about the ""balance of power"" then complain about court orders *from the Judicial Branch* and pretend like these are court orders from the Democratic party.  We truly are cooked.
Your whataboutism is a weak, stupid person's argument and isn't even tangentially related to anything being discussed here.
Go fuck your own face.
It's a generous gift, if a bend of the knee to his royal lowness. Let the monarchy reign. We have work to do.

Meanwhile Biden actually reduced childhood poverty and Republicans stripped this program away are when replacing it with something of 1/8 the dollars and claiming a victory lap:
The expanded child tax credit briefly slashed child poverty. Here's what else it did [npr.org]
In July 2021, for example, with the first monthly payment, Parolin and Curran write that ""the monthly child poverty rate fell from 15.8 percent to 11.9 percent. The first Child Tax Credit payment in July 2021, on its own, reduced the monthly child poverty rate by... 26 percent.""
It is $6.25 bn and while it is generous it is only $250 per child born during that narrow period of election significance.The Dell pledge is not for children born during ""that narrow period of election significance"" but rather applies to children under age ten that were not born during said period. AFAICT, the kids getting a thousand bucks do not benefit from this pledge at all.  The Dell pledge also only applies to children who live in zip codes where the median HHI is under $150k.Dell is piggybacking off of the infrastructure that already needs to be put in place to administer the accounts created by congress.

Well first it was just a figure of speech but second I have no particular issue with Dell hardware.  I'm not a fan but they've been perfectly cromulent systems when I've used them (i'm a Thinkpad fan myself)

You mean like colleges and universities that promise marketable skills to pay off student loans and then fail to deliver for a large proportion of their students?
Its a great idea in a capitalist society for every student to leave high school with a bankroll of capital. Will some of it be squandered? Yes. But I am willing to bet high schools students will be talking about what they plan to do with their bankroll and watching their older friends and siblings to see what worked and what didn't.

To be fair, Obamacare is called the Affordable Care Act but was nicknamed Obamacare by Republicans trying to disparage it. The LBJ space center was originally the Manned Spacecraft Center and it was renamed by Congress over a decade later. The Bush tax cuts were just called that because he implemented them. Trump however, is blatantly trying to name everything he can because he knows nobody else ever will.
They were called the Bush tax cuts as a disparaging term.Hardly. Bush himself was proud of the tax cuts. It's hardly disparaging to say he cut taxes when he was proud of doing so. Tax cuts (or rises) are typically always colloquially called after the person who implemented them regardless of whether they were good or bad.That really is nothing like the other examples.

That is what the poor or working class do, they don't own stocks that is locked up in an account.  The rich can afford to own much more, therefore mostly stocks and bonds and even speculative items.  It is great that the Dells are giving this away, but the effect will be minimal given the name of the account which is in itself a give away as to the motives and is a gimmick.

They say financial literacy is poor in the US.
Did you miss the part where it has to be invested in a market tracking index fund? The S&P 500, which is what people usually mean when they say ""the market"" has returned almost 10% / year over the last hundred years. Index fund fees are usually a fraction of a percent. So ~9% / year, subtract the US average inflation rate this century of 3% and you've got 6% real growth. No imaginary leverage scams needed.
that is a lot of interest that one one is getting. wonder if it even says if it goes bust they get the base funding back.

So, if I have kids but I'm not having more kids in the next 3 years, then why would I want a Trump account vs my own account somewhere?
Seems good if you are having a kids, its free money to invest for a long time. But if you have to fund the account you don't need a Trump account.
I think it's basically like a pre-provisioned 529 and the govt puts a little bit of money in there to get you started.  CA has a similar thing already I think.

GameStopPokÃ©mon TCG 
A holographic Gengar from the PokÃ©mon TCG set Skyridge just fetched over $30,000 at GameStop. The company is touting it as an “own” aimed at all the “trolls” who make fun of its infamously poor trade-in values. But the record-breaking deal is really a window into the meme stock retailer’s slimy new loot box idea: trading card Power Packs.
PokÃ©mon cards are a giant cash cow. Scalpers raid GameStop stores multiple times a month to buy up all the new products that the PokÃ©mon Company can’t print fast enough. But GameStop barely makes any profit off of those sales. It can’t just print its own PokÃ©mon cards and start selling them either. So it’s done the next best thing: It’s started opening its own packs and reselling the rarest cards as part of Power Packs, which are effectively digital slot machines.
To participate, customers set up Stripe accounts (a payment processing platform), select the Power Pack they want, and then watch to see what card they get. The program is done in partnership with Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA), so all of the cards are graded and slabbed. While the average value of a pack might be $100, most cards people get will be worth less than what they paid for the virtual blind box.
I was offered $30 for RDR2 8 days after it came out and my 100k reward points I had saved up for years were not restored when my auto renew membership was turned off from an update despite being a member for 15 years. Never forget https://t.co/Obq4ytTPu0
— Nathan ð¡ï¸ (@DistantGalaxy96) December 2, 2025

GameStop promises to buy back any cards players don’t want at 90 percent of “fair market value” minus a 6 percent commission. That commission is essentially GameStop’s cut since PSA also runs its own 90 percent buyback program without the fee. Some folks think it’s a rip-off. Supporters who are still banking on “GameStop to the moon” think it’s genius.
This new system is how one PokÃ©mon card collector found a PSA 10 Holo Gengar worth an estimated $33,883 in their Power Pack. They decided to sell it back to GameStop for $30,494.70. It’s still listed as a Power Pack high-value card for someone else to chase now.
GameStop gets to promote the exchange as “the most valuable single trade-in ever recorded in GameStop history,” even though the amount is contractually obligated through a completely separate program than the one people use to trade-in retro games, old controllers, and last year’s Madden for a fraction of their original sale value.
“I did get the chase card, I decided to sell it,” wrote user Fredflinstone00 on the Power Pack subreddit. “I purchased (2) of the $2,500 packs, I was able to sell my cards from each pack and pulled the Gengar on the 6th pack.” They said they’re getting about $28,000 after fees, which puts them up overall after being down $4,000 before the Gengar.
“I just sell the cards I don’t want and keep the ones I do want, I’ve had plenty shipped to me,” they told the community on Reddit. “With this card, the sales history is not the greatest, don’t want to risk a $10k move downwards, so I took the payout.”
That volatility is another one of the risks with Power Packs. The Gengar in question was only selling for around $5,000 as recently as 2023, and GameStop’s estimated market value matched the highest known sale of the card from back in October.
Others cash out the minute they get a chase card as well. A couple of weeks ago, Reddit user SnooPies662 snagged a PSA 10 Blaine’s Charizard worth $13,700. “Subsidized by my gf after losing 6k total on diamonds,” they wrote. “Safe to say I’m done forever now and achieved everything I could have possibly wanted from this.”

          Fish around in your attic, because this once worthless card can now buy you a meal
        

          Prices aren't quite so ridiculous as Mega Evolution...until you get to the Mega Charizard X
        

          The promotion is really just a glorified $5 coupon day
        

          Even if youâre not planning to trade something in, it might be worth hanging around your local GameStop for the theater of it all
        

          The scalping situation has become so bad that cards from the future are being hawked

SpaceX knows exactly where each terminal is because they have to for radio timing to work correctly with the moving satellites. Russia has to test those terminals somewhere. SpaceX could be giving that location to Ukraine. SpaceX could be permanently destroying any terminal that turns up near there and hasn't been cleared by Ukraine. SpaceX could be reporting the incoming locations of missiles and could be cutting service as soon as they realize that there's a surprise terminal moving rapidly towards a Ukrainian city.
Due to their lack of accuracy which makes them ineffective against hardened military targets, most of the Russian missiles are used in strict terror campaigns against civilian buildings: Power stations providing neighborhood heating, residential tower blocks with hundreds of families living in them, independent churches, nurseries often at times of maximum use and of course hospitals.
Getting on top of this and ensuring that Ukraine is a key supported customer that feels it gets what it needs could have allowed a real feel good story showing a company that took abuse and murder seriously. In fact it's pretty clear that some working at Starlink tried to do that at times and the management made it more difficult. Elon Musk is literally a baby killer.
SpaceX could be giving that location to Ukraine.Yeah, also the pigs could fly and elona could be a regular nice guy and not a Nazi on a wegovy diet.But none of these are actually happening.

Given dynamic battlefield, I don't think that is as easily done as you think, and the moment SpaceX makes a mistake and knocks out a Ukrainian drone on a mission, they'll be guilty for everything. There's not really a winning position for them here.
Russia isn't hiding that it targets civilian infrastructure. They still wage war the way everyone did it in 1939-1945. US and UK bombers essentially just opened the doors above German cities and let the unguided bombs fall wherever. We're not doing that anymore b 
Indeed.  The Germans started strategic bombing of civilian areas about 88 years ago, and in fact, the German president was just in Guernica paying his respects to the victims of that attack: https://www.theguardian.com/wo...  [theguardian.com].
We haven't stopped strategic bombing of civilian areas just because they don't work, it's also because it amounts to war crimes.  Britain bombed Germany like that as a response to Germany doing it to Britain and that being the only response Britain could muster at the time, but RAF Bomb

Nothing you said goes counter to my comment. You assume that all 8k birds are serving one dish at a time. They aren't. You probably also assume that Will Smith movie enemy of the state is a documentary about satellites. It's not, it's fiction. Satellites don't work that way.
The dish uses phased array to direct its antennas to the bird, not the other way around. This is so that the dish doesn't have to move. The bird aims a spot beam at the cell where the dish is located. The antenna compensates for Doppler 
> and the moment SpaceX makes a mistake and knocks out a Ukrainian drone on a mission
SpaceX doesn't need to do any such thing - they really just need to supply up to date location information to Ukraine. Ukraine can then send drones or whatever to any locations it doesn't like the look of, taking out testing and launch locations in the process. A large explosion ought to stop the terminal working, so SpaceX really doesn't need to do anything about it at all.
Of course, if SpaceX worked with the Ukrainians

The USAID cut related death toll is already up to 500k+, mostly children. If Elon isn't losing sleep already then I can't even imagine what would give him pause.

He's just another corporate sociopath - the only thing that matters to him is money and power. He'll only help out when its suits his purposes such as for Good PR , but like a lot of bullies he's also a coward to so won't put up when he really needs to such as in blocking starlink inside parts of russia.
I'm pretty sure Starlink is already blocked inside Russia.
SpaceX knows exactly where each terminal is because they have to for radio timing to work correctly with the moving satellites.This is quite false. It can only be known which cell the dish is in. You're thinking (likely without realizing) about Doppler. It doesn't work that way. And even then, it can still be slightly outside of that area. Photons don't work the way you think they do.

agree that NATO will not advance up to the Russian border
It's a bit late for that now: there are already four* NATO members which have a land border with Russia (not counting Poland and Lithuania, which only border Kaliningrad).
*Although I'm not sure that Norway's border is very relevant in practical terms
Thanks, Oleg.
Putin is one of the richest guys on the planet. He could have retired to, say, a chateau along the French riviera and lived out his remaining years in relative obscurity. Instead, he's a sadistic old man.
Vladimir can finish this tomorrow by sending his troops back across the border.
The only people benefiting from this war are putin and his ""Lake cooperative"", who remain in power because of the war.
Without the war, the so-called ""economy"" of putinland, which is now 146% war-driven, will collapse and that, the regime will disappear.
""Suing"" for peace won't work just like it didn't work with Nazi Germany, whose economy was driven to near collapse by Hitler's attempts to establish an autarky.

Funny, when Russia invaded Crimea, nothing was done, so that emboldened Putin to decide to invade the rest of Ukraine.   You want peace with Russia, make Russia give back the land it STOLE, then make a 300 mile buffer zone IN RUSSIAN LAND, because Putin is entirely at fault for what has been going on over there.   Ukraine wouldn't feel a need to join NATO if Russia hadn't invaded and taken land from Ukraine.
In September of 2022, when Ukraine was counter-attaking in the Kherson oblast and making significant headway,  Musk ordered Starlink service shut down [reuters.com] in that area.  Not all of Ukraine, just the Kherson and surrounding areas.

These constellations as designed act to defeat the censorship and information control of such nationsBullshit! These constellations are explicitly designed to enable censorship and control. It can be controlled by the the country, by the U.S., by Starlink, by Musk himself. They can turn off everything, a whole continent, a remarkably small region - I think three mile precision - and Individual terminals. And that's just Starlink's control. Then there is jamming, allowing external parties to control/censor.And there is absolutely no reason to expect Amazon Kuiper to be any different.

There's a huge difference:
Our governments, at least in theory, are controlled by us, the people. Ok, the 1% who make the major campaign contributions. But that's still a lot of people.
The number of SpaceX or Amazon shareholders who have enough shares to have a say in these matters is single-digits. So power is concentrated in much fewer hands.
> Our governments, at least in theory, are controlled by us, the people
Whenever you go vote, tell yourself ""this might be the last election"" . Doing that puts technologies and power structures in perspective...
The number of SpaceX or Amazon shareholders who have enough shares to have a say in these matters is single-digits.You think shareholders have a direct voice in day-to-day operations of a company? What is that mechanism?

Last I heard of something like that happening was when Roy E Disney was pissed that Eisner was screwing up the Disney-Pixar deal. He had to gather a dozen other large investors, overturn a good chunk of the board, then have them vote Eisner out to fix that deal.

And commercial operations are beholden to governments giving them the right to operate within their territory.There are many countries where starlink is not available, because their governments have not agreed terms for it to operate.
One thing Starlink could do is give the ukrainian government temporary (until the war ends) full access/control of all data flowing through the starlink network from any terminals within internationally recognised ukrainian territory.
Make it too dangerous for the russians to use, but still usable for ukraine.
As one comment said, ""It also shows that even Russia cannot block the terminals from its citizens""  Besides, the Starlink network isn't a ""military"" network.  Ukraine using it is because they were never prepared for this kind of attack.  The Russians...  well, honestly, don't they have sats and jamming networks?
Also we don't know how the uplink/downlink works.  It could be there is a large transmission area with overlapping sats that don't triangulate individual radios on the downlink.   Maybe the radios hi 
Starlink knows the location of its terminals.  They can simply whitelist Ukrainian terminals and geofence everything else so that it does not work in Ukraine.
Censorship comments make no sense because here terminals are only being switched on where they are allowed.  This condition would not apply to people in countries seeking to evade censorship given Starlink is complicit in facilitating censorship in places like China.
Geofencing is baked into their business model so they very much have the capability.  F 
the land is very valuable, that's where Ukraine's resources are.  Couple that with control of the sea front and Russia will get centuries of return on its ""investment"" (they don't care how many of their soldiers get killed)
The ""exit strategy"" is Russia controls a valuable chunk of Ukraine.
How do you imagine we could ""end the war anytime we like""?  Seems you're disconnected from reality and maybe ignorant of the subject of warfare.
Just as you live on land that was taken from someone else by killing, so it is 
Muskrat is openly on russia's side and using spacex to act against Ukraine! He bent the knee back in 2023, I think it was, by ordering Starlink blackouts strategically crafted to prevent Ukraine's communications in their defense from russia. And it's not even a general lack of service or anything he could blame on profitability or whatnot. He targets specific Ukrainian military operations and cuts the communications support for those. The only thing that's ""black"" about this ""market"" is the ink on the check

If getting back into shape is on your New Yearâs resolution list for 2026, investing in a smartwatch can be a good decision. The best options out there offer a nice mix of health, fitness, and connectivity features, plus a strong battery life. Garmin makes some of our favorite rugged, outdoor-friendly options on the market, and today is a great time to pick one up.
We just spotted the Garmin Forerunner 165, which retails for around $250 normally, sitting at $200 on Amazon right now. Thatâs after a nice 20% discount, and the offer applies to both black and white models. Even better, both Prime and non-Prime members will enjoy free delivery with their purchase, which brings the overall cost down even further. Offers this massive donât stay around for long, so itâs best to get yours in as fast as you can.
See at Amazon
In a minimal, lightweight build, the watch packs a brilliant AMOLED touchscreen display, paired with traditional button controls on the side. The screen is bright and clear; you wonât have a problem viewing your stats in any lighting condition.
This GPS watch is designed to train you, and it does an excellent job at that. Integrated Garmin Coach offers a bunch of training plans to help you work towards your fitness goals, while over 25 built-in sports apps let you track a wide range of activities, from swimming to cardio, cycling, strength training, and more. Those using it for running will appreciate detailed insights into metrics like cadence, stride strength, ground contact time, and more, which make it easy to understand areas that need improvement and make adjustments accordingly. Training effect shows how your workouts are impacting your health in real-time, just as well. Keeping your progress in mind, the watch also offers a list of suggested workouts every day. These adapt after every run to match your performance and overall recovery time, while also taking your goals into account.
Health-wise, it monitors your heart rate, plus tracks your sleep to help you understand how well youâre resting. Based on that, it creates a sleep score for you, which highlights your sleep stages, plus includes custom tips for sleeping better. Body battery energy monitoring takes it a step further by helping you find the best times for activity and rest.
Safety is taken just as seriously. If the watch senses an accident, it notifies your emergency contacts with your location details instantly. Feeling safe in a situation? You can send an alert manually, as well. Thereâs support for contactless payments, too; great for grabbing snacks or a cup of coffee on the go without relying on your wallet. Additionally, when you have the watch connected to your smartphone, youâll be able to see all your emails, texts, and other notifications right from your wrist, without needing to pull your phone out.
Battery life is another strong selling point. It lasts up to 11 days in the smartwatch modeâ¯and up to 19 hours in GPS mode. You can easily go more than a week when managing both modes together smartly. Thereâs a lot more to like about the Garmin Forerunner 165, especially with the current $50 discount. Itâs the lowest weâve seen it drop to in a long while, but the discount ends soon. If youâve been looking for the right moment to invest in a reliable smartwatch, now is a great time to make the move. Grab it before the discount ends or the stock runs out for good.

The holiday season is high stakes for TikTok Shop, which is trying to cement itself as a meaningful player in a crowded US e-commerce market.
This year, the shopping platform crossed half a billion dollars in US sales over the four-day holiday period between Black Friday and Cyber Monday, a company spokesperson said. TikTok measures sales by adding up spend via gross merchandise value, or GMV.
That figure is a relatively small piece of the broader e-commerce pie, which is dominated by Amazon. Overall, US e-commerce spend between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday was $44.2 billion, according to an Adobe analysis of direct online commerce transactions.
TikTok Shop is a relatively new player in US e-commerce, having officially launched in the country in September 2023 after a testing period.
Last year, the platform pulled in around $100 million in single-day US sales on Black Friday. While TikTok has historically relied on small and midsize businesses to drive sales, this year it featured a new crop of holiday listings from household name brands, including Ralph Lauren, Samsung US, and the Disney Store.
""A lot of more established major brands and sellers have felt more comfortable investing in TikTok, not just in advertising, but in its shopping and commerce features, which have also become more mature,"" said Sky Canaves, a principal analyst at EMARKETER, Business Insider's sister company.
One TikTok Shop staffer told Business Insider that the $500 million Black Friday week result seemed like a win.
""Not bad for official year two,"" they said.
Whether TikTok's owner, ByteDance, will be happy with the performance is another question. Even as the company announced its nine-figure Black Friday earnings last year, internally, leadership was disappointed with the US team's results, Business Insider reported earlier this year.
EMARKETER estimates that TikTok Shop will cross $15.8 billion in US sales this year. For context, EMARKETER estimates that Amazon's US sales will reach about $500 billion.
Social commerce, as a category, has seen healthy growth this year.
Live-shopping app Whatnot said it drew in $75 million in sales on Black Friday this year, triple what it pulled in for 2024. And Cyber Monday purchases driven by social media were up 56.5% from a year ago, according to Adobe.
EMARKETER expects social-commerce spending to cross $100 billion for the first time in 2026, driven in part by affiliate links from content creators who drive spending on traditional e-commerce platforms like Amazon.

November wasn't kind to some of the market's high-flying risk-on investments.
The Nasdaq 100 — dominated by the tech elite driving the AI trade — posted its first monthly decline since March.
Bitcoin, meanwhile, fared even worse, plunging 17%. It's been in a bear market since mid-November, and currently sits about 32% below record highs reached in early October. Based on where things stand now, that peak feels like a distant memory.
Selling pressure accelerated on Monday, with the king crypto tumbling as much as 8% to below $84,000.
What makes this particular bout of selling so concerning is that there's no single reason for the weakness. Bitcoin is instead suffering from a ruthless cocktail of headwinds all at once. They include:

The crypto market is facing the same concerns around overvaluation that tech stocks are, as investors balk at the eye-watering runs up in risk assets. Traders are also grappling with the residual effect of a record-setting $19 billion deleveraging event that started in early October and caused a weeks-long sell-off.
What's more, the selling pressure in bitcoin and stocks is seen as linked. Investors forced to liquidate bitcoin holdings sold stocks in order to do so. And negative sentiment in equities has bled into crypto. It's a feedback loop of continued selling.
What happens in Japan rarely impacts US investors — at least as directly as it has during the ongoing crypto sell-off. On Monday, after the Bank of Japan signaled that it will raise interest rates this month, sovereign bond yields spiked to multiyear highs.
This is notable because — as part of a so-called carry trade — global investors often borrow at near-zero rates to fund purchases in the US. Raising that rate throws a wrench into this plan and the willingness of traders to continue making risky bets in assets like crypto.
Previously, dip-buyers could be relied upon to scoop up bitcoin at discounted prices following a sell-off. But based on inflows to bitcoin-linked funds, retail investors haven't exactly been smashing the buy button after recent weakness. JPMorgan's team that monitors retail-investing trends also recently pointed out a reluctance to buy the dip.
I'm talking about Strategy, the OG bitcoin treasury company, and the largest corporate buyer of bitcoin. Last week, the company's CEO said that the firm may be forced to sell some of its holdings if a measure called ""mNAV"" — which compares Strategy's stock price to the value of its bitcoin holdings per share — dips below 1.
Don't look now, but that ratio is currently at 1.2. The prospect of forced selling by the top bitcoin treasury is giving other investors pause.
These forces are all combining to create a situation where the snap-back recovery normally enjoyed by bitcoin after periods of weakness is looking less and less likely. It's a view shared by Deutsche Bank, which argues that as bitcoin's legitimacy has increased, its fundamental reasons for declining have evolved. They offer a quote that sums it all up:
""Unlike prior crashes, driven primarily by retail speculation, this year's downturn has occurred amid substantial institutional participation, policy developments, and global macro trends,"" said analyst Marion Laboure.

Good music can bring life to any party, and the right speaker can make all your favorite tracks a lot more enjoyable. If youâve been after a powerful audio solution that offers bold sound and is easy to carry around, the JBL Partybox Encore Essential speaker is a great option to consider, and you can bring it home for less right now.
Amazon has dropped the price of this top-rated option by 39%, offering it for just $200 today. Youâre saving $130 on a unit thatâs going to make birthdays, anniversaries, New Yearâs Eve, and all other year-round occasions fun. Plus, your purchase will also include a three-month free trial of Amazon Music. However, thereâs a catch. Itâs a Cyber Monday deal, and since the event wrapped up at midnight, the deal is expected to expire soon, too. Itâs best to get your orders in quickly, to avoid last-minute disappointments.
See at Amazon
The speaker pushes the signature JBL Original Pro Sound with deep bass. Youâre going to feel all the highs and lows deep in your bones, even at the lower volumes. There wonât be any annoying distortion at higher levels, either, meaning you can pump the sound all the way up when that one song plays. The built-in ring light syncs to the music thatâs playing, offering you your very own light show. It dances to J. Loâs âOn the Floorâ, giving your gathering the boost it needs, and tones things down when something calmer plays. The visual effect really gets you into that party zone, deepening your connection to music, and helping you make better, more fun memories.
A single speaker offers bold, powerful sound on its own, but you can always use two of them together for an even bigger setup. Just ask a friend to bring theirs, and pair both the speakers wirelessly with True Wireless Stereo (TWS) technology. Speaking of connectivity, you can use the speaker either wired or wirelessly; both are supported. Plug it in for non-stop fun when youâre near an outlet, such as in your home or the backyard, and use it wirelessly on the go. The latter gets you up to 6 hours of playtime, which is enough for an entire night of jamming and vibing.
Durability comes from its IPX4 rating, which makes it splash-proof. Youâll be able to take it to the beach, by the pool, and even in the shower without a worry. The 90-day free trial of Amazon Music Unlimited takes the experience even further. The platform gets you access to over 100 million songs and ad-free listening. It also includes thousands of podcasts, plus offers one free audiobook per month. After the trial, your subscription will automatically continue at $12 per month ($11 for Prime members), if you choose to keep it.
Altogether, if youâve been after a portable speaker that can help you enjoy your favorite tracks to the fullest, now is a great time to make the move. This lingering Cyber Monday deal takes $130 off the price of a highly rated JBL option, but it ends soon. Itâs best to snap it fast, as weâre not expecting to stay around for more than a few hours. And once itâs gone, it might not be back at this price anytime soon. That said, itâs also a good time to grab anything else you missed purchasing during the main event.

12,2025-12-02,"You might think Amazon’s biggest swing in the AI race was its $8 billion investment in Anthropic. But AWS has also been building in-house foundation models, new chips, massive data centers, and agents meant to keep enterprise customers locked inside its ecosystem. The company believes these offerings will give it an edge as businesses of all shapes and sizes deploy AI in the real world.
WIRED sat down with AWS CEO Matt Garman ahead of the company’s annual re:Invent conference in Las Vegas to discuss his AI vision, and how he plans to extend Amazon’s lead in the cloud market over its fast-rising competitors, Microsoft and Google.
Garman is betting that AI is a service that AWS can deliver more cheaply and reliably than its rivals. Through Bedrock, Amazon’s platform for building AI apps, he says customers can access a variety of AI foundation models while keeping the familiar data controls, security layers, and reliability that AWS is known for. If that pitch holds up, it could help AWS dominate in the AI era.
“Two years ago, people were building AI applications. Now, people are building applications that have AI in them,” said Garman, arguing that AI is becoming a feature inside large products rather than a standalone experiment. “That's the platform that we've built, and that's where I think you see AWS really start to take the lead.”
Many of the announcements at this year’s re:Invent fall along these lines. Amazon unveiled new, cost-efficient AI models in its Nova series; agents that can work autonomously on software development and cybersecurity tasks; as well as a fresh offering, Forge, that lets enterprises cheaply train AI models on their own data.
The stakes are high for AWS to get this right. While Amazon’s cloud unit dominated the smartphone era, smaller rivals like Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure have grown at higher rates since the arrival of ChatGPT. Microsoft and Google have surged by tightly integrating with frontier AI models—the technology underlying ChatGPT and Gemini, respectively—attracting enterprises eager to experiment with cutting-edge capabilities.
This rise of AWS’s rivals has raised questions about Amazon’s broader AI strategy, and how the incumbent will fare in the years to come.
Garman says he’s been hearing these concerns for years, but less so in recent months. He argues that the tide is turning, pointing to AWS’s stronger-than-expected results in the company’s third quarter as evidence that his strategy is working.
The counter argument to his approach comes from other AI leaders, who believe that AI is a more fundamental shift in computing and will force companies to completely rethink their approach to product development. In a world where AI is a true paradigm shift, cutting-edge AI capabilities may take precedence, and incumbents like AWS could be in a more precarious position.
AI seems to be driving major organizational changes inside of Amazon. In October, the company announced it would lay off 14,000 people as it invests more in AI. Those layoffs came just a few months after Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said Amazon would need fewer people in certain areas because of AI.
Internally, Garman says that AI tools are significantly accelerating some engineering teams’ work as employees shift from writing code themselves to directing a team of AI agents. He says one AWS team recently did a big rewrite of an internal codebase, expecting that it would take 30 people roughly 18 months to complete. With the use of AI, Garman claims the team was able to complete the task with just six people in 71 days.
Some Amazon employees have a less optimistic tone when it comes to the company’s embrace of AI. In November, more than 1,000 anonymous Amazon employees signed a petition warning that the company’s “aggressive” AI rollout could come at a cost to the environment.
Garman notes that the upside of AI agents are not unlimited—though his focus here is around agent management, not environmental impact.
“Agents are most effective when you ask them to do things that … you actually know how to do yourself,” he said. “So these are not replacements for people. They are ways to make people more effective at their jobs.”
Still, Amazon says the efficiency gains of AI are also making their way to Amazon customers. Reddit was given early access to Amazon’s new Forge service, and was able to train an AI model on millions of content moderation decisions, according to AWS. Reddit said the AI model it made with Amazon developed a “social intuition,” and can now help with content moderation for millions of its online communities.
While Amazon is betting big on AI, Garman is skeptical of the exuberance sweeping the broader industry. This year, early stage labs like Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab and Ilya Sutskever’s Safe Superintelligence nabbed multibillion-dollar investments, despite that they’re not yet deploying widely used products.
“When people talk about a bubble, I think those are the deals that are most at risk,” said Garman, referring to AI startups that have raised billion dollar seed rounds. “Where it's a $3 billion valuation for a startup with no lines of code. Maybe, but maybe not. Those are the ones where I think there's open questions.”
But Garman insists that Amazon’s AI investments are justified. The company brought on 3.8 gigawatts of new infrastructure capacity in the past 12 months, and just announced an up to $50 billion investment in AI data centers for the US government. Amazon says it’s still able to sell off new capacity as soon as it comes online.
“I see the value that so many companies are getting out of AI today, and I don't see that there's any pullback,” said Garman. “They're getting real returns. They're delivering real value to their customers. And so for us, that is a good signal, and we're still in the early stages of what that value is going to be.”
As Silicon Valley continues to chase superintelligence and AGI, AWS seems to be taking a more grounded approach. Whether that’s enough to remain king of the cloud providers remains to be seen.
Question for the audience:
With the launch of Gemini 3, I’m hearing a lot of folks in the AI industry say that AI progress hasn’t stalled, despite what the skeptics might think. I’d love to hear from Model Behavior readers: What are you doing with AI today that wasn’t possible 12 months ago? On the flip side, how is the technology the same (capability-wise) as it was last year? Respond in the comments below or email me—happy to keep things off record.

13,2025-12-02,"If you’re near Rochester, New York, the price for a carton of Target’s Good & Gather eggs is listed as $1.99 on its website. If you’re in Manhattan’s upscale Tribeca neighborhood, that price changes to $2.29. It’s unclear why the prices differ, but a new notice on Target’s website offers a potential hint: “This price was set by an algorithm using your personal data.”
A recently enacted New York State law requires businesses that algorithmically set prices using customers’ personal data to disclose that. According to the law, personal data includes any data that can be “linked or reasonably linked, directly or indirectly, with a specific consumer or device.” The law doesn’t require businesses to explicitly state what information about a person or device is being used or how each piece of information affects the final price a customer sees. The law includes a carve-out for the use of location data strictly to calculate cab or rideshare fares based on mileage and trip duration but not for other purposes.
The law also requires that the disclosure is “clear and conspicuous.” Target’s disclosure is not the easiest to find–a customer would have to know to click the “i” icon next to the price of an item, then scroll to the bottom of the pop-up. In the past, the courts have held that it’s not always reasonable to assume that a customer will click on “more information” links when it’s not required.
Target didn’t respond to questions about the price differences or explain what personal data was used per the disclosures.
For years, Target has had a practice of setting different prices for different locations. In 2021, the Huffington Post found that Target’s website changed prices depending on the store location associated with a user, and a spokesperson for the company told reporters at the time that its online prices “reflect the local market.” In 2022, the company settled a lawsuit filed by multiple California county district attorneys that alleged it used geofencing to automatically update the prices listed in customers’ Target apps. Today, when you visit Target’s website, it still automatically associates you with a nearby store, which you can change in the website’s settings. (Target didn’t respond to questions about how it decided which brick-and-mortar store to automatically associate with a website visitor.)
In addition to eggs, the price of toilet paper also appears to change based on what store a customer is associated with. For those whose store is set in Flushing, Queens, a six-pack of Mega Charmin Ultra Strong Septic-Safe Toilet Paper is $8.69. Those with the Tribeca location are shown $8.99 for the same listing.
Target’s pricing practices aren’t unique or all that new—nor are they illegal. In 2012, The Wall Street Journal reported that office supply retailer Staples was displaying different prices to customers on its website after estimating their location. At the time, Staples acknowledged the practice, telling the Journal that its prices “do vary by geography due to a variety of factors, including rent, labor, distribution, and other costs of doing business.” In 2015, ProPublica found that the Princeton Review’s online SAT tutoring packages sometimes varied by thousands of dollars based on the zip code provided by customers. Similar to Staples, the Princeton Review told ProPublica that its pricing was based on the “costs of running our business and the competitive attributes of the given market.”
Last year, the Federal Trade Commission initiated a market study on what it called “surveillance pricing,” which it said included using a customer’s location to help set prices. The agency published an interim report in January but has yet to release a final report. (I was previously employed by the FTC; Target was not included in the market study.)
Beyond eggs and toilet paper, it’s not clear what else retailers are pricing algorithmically (or how). The disclosures could potentially shed some light on the variety of goods customers pay different prices for, even if it doesn’t necessarily help consumers understand why. The New York law might be followed by similar legislation in other states—at least one other state, Pennsylvania, introduced a similar bill earlier this year—and a federal bill addressing surveillance pricing was introduced in July. There’s broader regulatory interest in the ways that AI and algorithms can influence consumer pricing: According to JD Supra, over 50 bills related to algorithmic pricing, including those related to algorithmic price-fixing and the use of certain characteristics in dynamic pricing algorithms, have been introduced at the state level across the United States.
Meanwhile, Target has been exploring other high-tech efforts. It recently announced that it is launching a Target app in OpenAI’s ChatGPT, where consumers will be able to lean on the chatbot for personalized shopping recommendations.

The AI frenzy that's driving markets and corporate spending may be heading for a hard landing in 2026.
In an interview with Norges Bank Investment Management CEO Nicolai Tangen, renowned economist Ruchir Sharma said that the AI surge now checks every box on his four-part bubble checklist. And a single trigger could bring it all crashing down in 2026 — higher interest rates.
Higher rates reduce the availability of cheap capital that's been fueling AI investment and put downward pressure on growth-stock valuations.
To diagnose bubbles, Sharma uses what he calls the four O's. He said the AI boom is flashing red on all four: overinvestment, overvaluation, over-ownership, and over-leverage.
Sharma said that AI and tech spending in the US has surged at a rate that is comparable to past bubbles, such as the dot-com era. Valuations of major AI players are also approaching bubble territory when judged by long-term earnings and free cash flow.
At the same time, Americans are holding a record share of their wealth in equities, and most of those trades are AI-related, he said.
And after years of running cash-rich balance sheets, Big Tech is now issuing massive amounts of debt to fund the AI arms race.
Over the last few months, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft have become ""the biggest issuers of debt,"" Sharma said — a classic late-cycle bubble sign.
Sharma estimated that roughly 60% of US economic growth this year has been driven by AI, both through companies pouring money into new infrastructure and through the stock-market wealth effect lifting spending among high-income consumers.
But the underlying economy looks much weaker without it, he said — and that's exactly why Sharma thinks the AI trade has become so dangerously crowded.
""Outside of AI, there's a lot of weakness in the US economy,"" he said.
""This big bet on AI better work out for America — because if it doesn't work out, then I think there's a lot of trouble for this country ahead,"" he added.
Sharma doesn't pretend he can call the exact top. But he said one thing bursts every bubble, and that is interest rates going up.
He identified three conditions that are already building. First, inflation remains ""sticky,"" and far from the Fed's 2% target, he said. Second, the Fed has missed its target for five consecutive years and may soon face pressure to halt its interest rate cuts. Thirdly, AI-driven investment has sustained strong growth, which could push inflation higher again.
""At the slightest sign that interest rates are going to go up, I think that's your sign that, 'Okay — this is done now,'"" Sharma said.
That's because higher rates make borrowing costlier and slash the valuations of high-growth companies — the exact conditions that tend to burst bubbles.
He said he expects that moment to likely arrive in 2026 — a view shared by other veteran investors, but on different timelines.
Greg Jensen, co-chief investment officer at Bridgewater Associates, said on Tangen's podcast last week that ""the bubble is ahead of us"" without giving a timeline, while Mel Williams, cofounder and partner at TrueBridge Capital Partners, warned of ""a lot of carnage"" over the next 10 years.
Sharma said the AI boom could be a ""good bubble"" that could ultimately boost productivity — like past tech manias that overshot but left valuable infrastructure in their wake. But that doesn't mean investors won't get hurt.
Still, one area he thinks could shine after the correction is quality stocks — companies with high returns on equity, strong balance sheets, and consistent earnings.
That category has badly underperformed the market during the AI frenzy, creating what he called ""the single best investment idea"" heading into 2026.

Elon Musk’s Tesla has become the target of the “The Big Short” investor Michael Burry’s scrutiny. In a recent blog post, Burry gave his thoughts on the company’s current valuation and made some concerning predictions about its future.
Investor and hedge fund manager Michael Burry has criticized Tesla on the Sunday edition of his Substack newsletter ‘Cassandra Unchained.’ He also took aim at Elon Musk’s new $1 trillion pay plan, which was approved by Tesla shareholders in November, saying that it will have a further impact on its valuation.
“Tesla’s market capitalization is ridiculously overvalued today and has been for a good long time,” Burry wrote in the blog. According to an estimation presented by the investor, Tesla dilutes its shareholders at a rate of approximately 3.6% per year without any buybacks. He further predicted that Musk’s new compensation plan would make the dilution worse. (via Reuters)
On November 3, Tesla shareholders agreed on a record-breaking pay package for Elon Musk that will make him the first trillionaire in the world. If the CEO manages to achieve a string of targets, such as reaching a market capitalization of $8.5 trillion, he would make upwards of $1 trillion in stock.
This isn’t the first time Burry has voiced his concern about Tesla. In May 2021, he revealed a bearish bet against the Musk-led company. However, five months later, the investor shared that he is not betting against Tesla anymore, calling his position just a trade.
Burry first rose to global prominence in the late 2000s, when he accurately predicted the subprime mortgage crisis that led to the 2008 financial crisis. It was documented in the 2010 bestseller “The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine,” by financial journalist Michael Lewis. The book was later adapted into the Oscar-winning movie of the same name starring Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, and Brad Pitt.

Total 2025 shipments are forecast to grow 6.1 percent year over year due to ‌iPhone 17‌ demand and increased sales in China, a major market for Apple.
Overall worldwide smartphone shipments across Android and iOS are forecast to grow 1.5 percent, primarily because of the success of the iPhone.

In China, Apple's largest market, massive demand for iPhone 17 has significantly accelerated Apple's performance. It ranked first in October and November per IDC's China Monthly Sales data with more than 20% share, miles ahead of the competition, leading IDC to revise Apple's Q4 forecast in China from 9% to 17% YoY. This turns a previously projected 1% decline in China for 2025 into a positive 3% growth, that's a phenomenal turnaround. The success story is replicated across all regions, including the US and Western Europe that had previously slowed down. This calendar year will not only be a record period for Apple in terms of shipments but also in value, which is forecast to exceed $261 billion, with 7.2% YoY growth in 2025.
Back in October, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that Apple is expecting to set a new all-time revenue record in the December quarter, and a best-ever revenue record for the ‌iPhone‌. Apple believes overall revenue will grow 10 to 12 percent year-over-year.
Apple has seen strong interest in the standard ‌iPhone 17‌ and the iPhone 17 Pro models, even though the iPhone Air hasn't performed as expected.
Next year, Apple plans to change its ‌iPhone‌ release timelines. The high-end ‌iPhone‌ Fold and the iPhone 18 Pro models will come out in September 2026 as usual, but the lower-priced ‌iPhone 18‌ will be held until spring 2027.
IDC predicts that the decision will drop iOS shipments by 4.2 percent in 2026, while a global memory shortage will lead to supply constraints and price increases across the smartphone market. Total global smartphone shipments could decline 0.9 percent in 2026 due to the supply issues and Apple's lineup changes.

Duane Flemming and his wife, Chris Currie, would like to downsize.
The retired couple has spent 41 years in their four-bedroom house in a suburban community 30 miles east of San Francisco. The two-story home has gotten too big for them, and the stairs are more difficult to navigate these days. Plus, they'd like to avoid expensive renovations and upkeep. But Flemming, an 81-year-old retired veterinarian, is worried about the hefty tax they'd have to pay on their home sale profits.
""We don't use three-quarters of the rooms we've got,"" he said. ""We don't need it, and we would love to be able to get rid of it in an easy fashion, without having all of those huge expenses that are going to cost us down the line.""
Since 1997, home sellers have faced a federal capital gains tax on home sales with profits over $500,000 for married couples and $250,000 for single filers. The tax can be as high as 20% of the profits over the threshold, and is determined by income. That doesn't include potential state taxes.
Flemming estimates that his house has appreciated about $800,000 over the last four decades, and that he'd have to pay between $30,000 and $60,000 in capital gains taxes on his home sale. He worries that the remaining cash won't be enough to buy a new home and pay for rising long-term care costs on a fixed income.
""When you don't know what the future holds, and you've got a limited ability to increase your income, you start to be a little bit more cautious,"" Flemming said.
The share of home sales subject to the capital gains tax has more than doubled in the past few years, in large part because home values have soared. About 34% of US homeowners could exceed the $250,000 cap for single filers if they were to sell, and 10% could exceed the $500,000 threshold, the National Association of Realtors found in a 2025 report. That's up from 1.3% of US sellers in 2003 and 3% in 2019, the property data firm CoreLogic found.
If the capital gains tax had been adjusted for inflation when it was implemented, the $250,000 cutoff for individual home sellers in 1997 dollars would be about twice as high — $496,000 — in 2024 dollars.
If Flemming and Currie hold onto their home until they die, their two adult children will be able to inherit it with what's called a stepped-up tax basis, meaning they'd only have to pay capital gains taxes on the amount the home appreciates after they inherit it, erasing the tax burden on the increased value over their parents' lives. Federal estate taxes would only apply if their children inherit at least $28 million in assets — far more than the value of their parents' home.
These tax policies are incentivizing some older homeowners to hang onto their homes for the rest of their lives, making it harder for younger families to buy larger homes.
The growing burden of the capital gains tax, particularly on empty nesters, has long created a so-called ""lock-in effect,"" discouraging older homeowners from moving into homes that better suit their needs. As more people have been affected, it's caused a ""gumming up of the market,"" said Jim Parrott, a nonresident fellow at the Urban Institute who served as a housing policy advisor in the Obama White House.
The real-estate company Redfin reported that as of 2022, empty-nest boomers owned twice as many homes with three or more bedrooms as millennials with kids owned. This ""giant mismatch,"" as Parrott called it, between the homes people are living in and where they'd like to live, is having ripple effects across the housing market, particularly in the most in-demand and expensive places. ""The knock-on effects for what's a completely reasonable decision for empty nesters is utterly unreasonable in its macro impact on the housing market,"" he said.
There's some bipartisan support in Washington for reforming the capital gains tax for real-estate sales. President Donald Trump has even said his administration is looking into eliminating it entirely.
Rep. Jimmy Panetta, a California Democrat whose district includes several pricey coastal regions, has introduced legislation to double the tax exclusion to $500,000 for individuals and $1 million for joint-filing couples and index it to inflation.
Because the tax disproportionately impacts wealthier people, offering relief could be regressive. But some liberals support reforming it in a targeted way to relieve some of the lock-in effect. Parrott has proposed a more modest reform: doubling the exemption for the tax and indexing it to inflation for sellers who are 65 and older or who've owned their homes for at least a decade.
Other tax policy experts don't think another tax break for affluent Americans is strategic or would move the needle on housing affordability.
Tax relief would mean less revenue for the federal government at a time when the US debt is soaring, and wealthy households are already benefiting from a slew of tax breaks pushed through under Trump. ""From a national debt perspective, this seems like the worst possible time to deliver a big capital gains tax cut,"" said Daniel Hemel, a professor of tax law at New York University.
Hemel also isn't convinced that reforming the tax would do much to loosen up the market and cool home prices. The tax causes a delay in sales, but eventually homeowners die and their kids put the houses on the market, he said.
""You get a delay in the time of sale, but people don't live forever,"" Hemel said. ""We're seeing some houses on the market now that wouldn't have been on the market now, but for capital gains taxes. And then there are also some houses that would have been on the market now that aren't on the market now because of capital gains taxes.""
Of course, one way to avoid the tax while simultaneously downsizing is to move out and rent the place.
Patrick G., a 74-year-old retiree based in Colorado, is considering doing just that. His wife died in 2023, and those who lose a spouse are eligible for the $500,000 tax exemption for just two years following their death. Patrick said he's more likely to rent out his four-bedroom home so that his kids can inherit it with the stepped-up basis.
Upon the death of a spouse, many survivors get at least a partially stepped-up basis for the capital gains tax calculation, depending on how the ownership of the home was structured and how their state handles marital property.
""If it becomes inevitable that the home in Colorado is no longer feasible, then most certainly, I would probably turn it over to a property manager and let it become either an income stream or an appreciating asset for my kids when I pass,"" said Patrick, who requested partial anonymity to discuss his personal financial situation.
Collin Goodall, an artist who lives in Rumson, New Jersey, is in a similar position. His wife recently died, and he's deciding whether or not to sell the house he's owned and lived in for the last three decades. If Zillow's estimate is accurate, the home is worth about $1.2 million more than he bought it for. He's considering moving and renting his home, or just renting out a room while he lives there.
""I would not like to make a decision about downsizing, driven by, am I going to save a bunch in taxes. That shouldn't be what I'm thinking about,"" he said.
Parrott conceded that reforming the capital gains tax is far from a silver bullet for housing affordability. It's a ""modest solution that will have a modest impact,"" he said. But he noted that fixing the housing supply shortage requires ""a heterogeneous set of solutions"" to a bunch of different problems.
Update — December 2, 2025: This article has been updated to include the fact that spousal survivors often receive a stepped-up basis for capital gains taxes on home sales.

It was a tough day for one of the nation's largest transaction platforms to experience instability.
Shopify suffered an outage on Cyber Monday, freezing some merchants out of their accounts and point-of-sale systems during one of the busiest shopping days of the year.
The financial impact is still unclear. A spokesperson directed Business Insider to the company's status page.

Many small business owners posted on social media to tell shoppers that their shipping labels could not be generated and that they may experience issues during checkout.
A post shared by MINDFLOWERS (@ourmindflowers)
Outage tracker Downdetector showed a spike of roughly 4,000 problem reports at 11 a.m. ET, with thousands more pouring in around 1:15 p.m. ET.
The Canadian e-commerce transaction giant said early afternoon on its status page that some sellers were ""experiencing issues"" with Shopify admin, Point of Sales, Mobile, and Shopify Support.
By mid-afternoon, Shopify reported that services were recovering after engineers fixed an issue with the company's login authentication flow, though pockets of disruption remained.
""We are seeing signs of recovery for admin and POS login issues now,"" Shopify said in a 2:31 p.m. ET update, adding that teams were still monitoring the situation.
By 3:38 p.m. ET, Shopify said in its most recent status update that its Help Center is still ""experiencing longer than normal wait times.""
As of 9 p.m. ET, Point of Sale, API & Mobile, and Support are still considered to have ""degraded performance.""
Shopify powers more than 10% of US e-commerce sales. The company's President, Harley Finkelstein, said in a press release on Saturday that the platform processed $6.2 billion in gross merchandise volume on Black Friday, up 25% year over year, led by cosmetics, activewear, fitness, and nutrition.
Shopify's stock closed 5.8% down on Monday.

25,2025-12-02,"The Princess of Wales has sent a Christmas message about the importance of acts of kindness in times that can seem ""fragmented or uncertain"", in a letter to guests attending her carol concert in Westminster Abbey on Friday.
""The time, care and compassion you give, often quietly and unspoken, and without any expectation or recognition, make an extraordinary difference to the lives of others,"" writes Catherine.
Alongside members of the Royal Family, the 1,600 guests will include volunteers and people who have helped local communities.
Traditional Christmas carols will be sung in the specially decorated Abbey, with readings and music from performers including Hannah Waddingham and Kate Winslet.
""At its heart, Christmas speaks of love taking form in the simplest, most human ways,"" write Catherine in her letter to guests.
""Not in sentimental or grand gestures, but gentle ones. A moment of listening, a word of comfort, a friendly conversation, a helping hand, presence.""
Last month she gave her first public speech in two years, as she gradually recovers after her cancer diagnosis and chemotherapy.
While guests are waiting to get inside Westminster Abbey, they will hear music from young people supported by the the Future Talent charity, co-founded by the late Duchess of Kent, who died this autumn.
The duchess, who taught music in a state primary school, wanted to provide wider access to music lessons to children from disadvantaged backgrounds.
Among the guests will be Anna and Jonathan Cordiner, whose daughter died of a brain tumour, and who set up a charity, Kayleigh's Wee Stars, to support families where a child has a terminal illness.
Also attending will be Saphia Turner, aged nine, the winner of the BBC's Make a Difference Young Hero Award, who sells artwork and carries out sponsored challenges to raise money for food banks.
""As the year draws to a close, I hope this season brings you moments of peace and clarity, and that you too, feel surrounded by the same love and care that you offer so freely,"" writes Catherine.
Earlier on Tuesday, MPs on the Public Accounts Committee published information about royal leases, including Prince William and Catherine's new home, Forest Lodge in Windsor.
It showed they had a 20-year lease with the Crown Estate, with the couple paying a market rent, determined by independent valuers.
The public spending watchdog is to hold an inquiry into the Crown Estate and royal property next year, in the wake of questions over Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's arrangements in Royal Lodge.

Sorry, Raspberry Pi fans, the RAM price debacle has now come to roost for the beloved brand that makes miniature computers. As is always the case with supply chain constraints, major global economic disruptions will inevitably hurt the smallest companies first. And, yet again, you can thank the ballooning demands of AI for the price hikes.
The company, which makes low-cost single-board computers used in a variety of computer builds and hacks, is bumping up the cost of its Raspberry Pi 4 and 5. Raspberry Pi CEO Eben Upton says that the move is to offset âthe recent unprecedented rise in the cost of LPDDR4 memory.â How much more each model costs depends on the size of each computerâs RAM. A 4GB Raspberry Pi 4 will cost $60, $5 more than before. An 8GB model will go up by $10, from $75 to $85.
See Raspberry Pi at Amazon
The top-end Raspberry Pi 5 with 16GB of LPDDR4 RAM will demand $145, up $25 from before the price hike. Upton said his company would start âunwindingâ these new costs once the pressure on memory prices finally dissipates. When that could happen is anyoneâs guess, but analysts have warned we may not see any relief until 2027 at the earliest. Digitimes reported, based on comments from memory maker TeamGroup, that the memory supply will only get worse going into 2026.
The higher costs are in addition to price hikes of Raspberry Piâs 4GB and 8GB compute modules. The companyâs 16GB variant of its Compute Module 5 now starts at $140. Meanwhile, a new Raspberry Pi 5 with only 1GB of RAM will now cost $45, which may be good news for tinkerers constructing small-scale DIY projects. However, even something as small as a cyberdeckâold-school, mobile computers meant to ape mid-80s cyberpunk designsâwill still want more RAM for the sake of today’s internet browsers.
Raspberry Pi is still small enough that price hikes could hurt sales. Major tech firms are building AI data centers all over the U.S. and across the world, and these centers are demanding huge amounts of high-bandwidth memory. DRAM (dynamic random access memory) makers are refocusing their production for AI data centers, which are willing to pay much more for these computing components than the consumer-focused brands.
Major PC component makers, like TeamGroup and Corsair, have both made public statements that contract prices for DRAM and NAND (the major type of todayâs flash storage) have doubled in recent months. That has led to RAM prices blowing through the roof. Some RAM prices have increased by 500%.

— CyberPowerPC (@CYBERPOWERPC) November 25, 2025

CyberPowerPC, a major prebuilt PC maker, announced late last month it plans to adjust prices of all its desktop towers starting on Dec. 7. The PC maker added that SSD (solid state drive) storage prices have increased by 100%, but that âprice increases will be temporary.â Nothing is off the table, and prices will get far worse before they get better, but we’ve only seen the start of the memory crunch. Expect GPUs, which rely on VRAM, and CPUs to also get more expensive. UK-based computer retailer Overclockers UK told PC Gamer the price of graphics cards may increase late in this year, but it will get worse in 2026.
From the smallest to the high-end consumer-level computer, no price is safe.

Film writer, producer, and programmer Kier-La Janisse is best known for her nonfiction books (including the scholarly horror tome House of Psychotic Women and the encyclopedic Warped & Faded: Weird Wednesday and the Birth of the American Genre Film Archive) and her epic folk-horror documentary Woodlands Dark and Days Bewitched. But she makes her narrative film debut in this yearâs installment of The Haunted Season, an annual series she created last year to bring spooky short films to Shudder at Christmas.
io9 talked to Janisse in 2024 when the first film in the series, To Fire You Come at Last, arrived on the streamer. That entry was written and directed by Sean Hogan and follows a group of men lugging a coffin to its final resting place. Itâs an effective and creepy tale, but it doesnât reference Christmas in any way. Last year, Janisse explained The Haunted Season isnât that kind of âholidayâ series; instead, itâs picking up what the BBCâs popular A Ghost Story for Christmas has been putting down for decades.
Often drawing on early 20th-century tales written by M.R. James and his contemporaries, it taps into storytelling traditions that go back centuriesâcommunity building by sharing scary tales around a fireâand became even more popular in Victorian times with the release of Charles Dickensâ A Christmas Carol, which is obviously stuffed with festive ghosts galore.
âThat is what The Haunted Season is based on,â Janisse told io9 last year. âThis idea of an annual ghost story film that premieres every year â¦ Itâs basically a Christmas special thatâs ongoing, where thereâs a new installment every year. That tradition still exists in the UK. So this series is just part of that bigger tradition.â
Back then, all Janisse would tease about the future of The Haunted Season was that they will all be period stories, set no later than the 1960sâand that she herself would be directing an upcoming entry.
That film is now hereâit hit Shudder December 1âand itâs called The Occupant of the Room, based on Algernon Blackwoodâs 1909 short story of the same name, though the film takes place in the early 1930s. It runs 30 minutes and features live-action and animation, plus a mood that escalates from unease to outright despair, helped along by a stirring score by experimental sound artist the Nausea.
From the start, the screws start to turn. A flustered man (Don McKellar) arrives at an isolated mountain inn amid a late-night snowstorm, only to learn his reservation was never confirmed and all the rooms are full. In fact, itâs so close to Christmas, all the rooms in the entire village are full.
The front-desk clerk is politely sending the man on his way when suddenly, the proprietress emerges and offers him lodging that comes with a catch: a room thatâs empty only because the guest who rented it went hiking a few days prior and has yet to return. She might appear at any moment and kick him out, in other words. But itâs better than sleeping in the snow, so he accepts the odd offer. He even willingly pays double the going rate.
With this prickly setup priming us for a confrontation or worse, we watch as the man takes stock of the roomâthe womanâs possessions are still scattered about; most eerily, thereâs a strand of her long, dark hair lingering in the washbasinâand settles in for what turns out to be the least relaxing night of his life.
Janisse has clearly watched and studied many A Ghost Story for Christmas episodes; her expertise also includes editing Yuletide Terror: Christmas Horror on Film and Television, an anthology book that digs even more broadly into seasonal horror as a genre. And she nails the bleak, grim, ice-cold atmosphere of those old BBC episodes perfectly for The Occupant of the Room.
The travelerâs predicament is so dire he agrees to an arrangement he knows might lead to an awkward situation; thereâs also the uncomfortable thought that heâs benefiting from the previous guestâs presumed misfortune. Plus, there’s the feeling of invading someoneâs private space, even if theyâre not physically present. But beyond his initial misgivings, thereâs also a weird vibe in the room. An âinfection of melancholy,â as he calls it, and the film plunges us into that mindset with a black-and-white animated sequence that rips through his increasingly horrified perception of what it feels like being there.
If itâs Christmas cheer you seek, The Haunted Season should not be your destination. But if chills delight you the most, you can find The Occupant of the Room and To Fire You Come at Lastâas well as some of the classic BBC A Ghost Story for Christmas entries that inspired this new seriesâon Shudder now.

Logan Brown, a 30-year-old corporate lawyer, began the year billing hours at the global law firm Cooley. Now she's building a tech-first law firm that meets the routine needs of startups, without the Big Law price tag.
Soxton, Brown's new venture, has raised $2.5 million in pre-seed funding, Business Insider has learned exclusively.
""I didn't have a deck. I didn't have a team,"" Brown said.
Instead, she told investors, ""I am building the solution for founders. That is not the billable hour.""
Cooley hired Brown straight out of Harvard Law School. She spent about two and a half years working with emerging companies and helping open the firm's Miami office. In May, she took a risk and left a secure Big Law job to launch her own startup.
Two weeks after her last day, she flew to New York City and dropped in on an event hosted by a fund she had pitched.
There, she met Katie Jacobs Stanton, a venture capitalist who founded Moxxie Ventures and who has held executive roles at Twitter, Google, and Yahoo. Brown gave her the quick version of Soxton on the spot. Moxxie Ventures sent over a term sheet within a week.
""I've never moved so fast to invest,"" Jacobs Stanton told Business Insider.
Moxxie led the round, with participation from Coalition, Strobe Ventures, Flex, Park Rangers Capital, and Flickr cofounder Caterina Fake.
Unlike the legal software vendor Harvey, Soxton doesn't sell software to law firms. It offers legal services directly to startups. Brown said the company helps founders tick the boxes at the top of their checklists: incorporation, fundraising, equity issuance, and compliance checks.
Brown said Soxton does not replace a law firm when it comes to nuanced legal work. What it can replace, she says, is the shaky legal advice founders might pull from ChatGPT or another chatbot.
For $20 a month, clients can grab a contract template from Soxton's library and tweak the language. Most clients request a custom contract reviewed by an attorney, Brown said, with Soxton turning it around in four hours for $100.
While Soxton has been operating in stealth, with only a waitlist on its website, Brown said more than 270 companies — mostly pre-seed startups — have used it so far. Many clients are founders who wouldn't hire a lawyer so early and would otherwise turn to ChatGPT to ask questions.
""People put their contracts into ChatGPT, and they say, 'What does this mean?' It's often very wrong,"" Brown said. ""I think it's designed to sound correct. Founders really rely on that, and so we're working on retraining founders.""
A smaller slice of clients are startups that have raised funding and are already working with a Big Law firm, though they still route low-stakes work such as advisor agreements and influencer contracts through Soxton.
The legal tech industry has undergone major shifts this year. The first wave of startups developed tools for law firms, aiming to make legal services faster and cheaper. The newer wave handles the work itself, hiring lawyers on contract and arming them with software that can chew through documents and spit out summaries and drafts.
Crosby, backed by Sequoia Capital, handles the unglamorous but essential chore of contract review. Covenant helps private-market investors parse dense fund documents. Manifest Law and Casium use AI to file and track visa applications for employers.
Brown shrugged off comparisons to Crosby. That startup, which announced a $20 million Series A in October, largely serves more established companies than Soxton's typical day-one clients. Brown casts Soxton as more of an outside general counsel for founders, while Crosby focuses on contract review.
Ashley Mayer, cofounder and general partner of Coalition, says while other companies focus on ""bigger-ticket"" mid-market and business customers, Brown makes a smart bet on young companies.
""By offering a better, more affordable product, Soxton actually expands the market, making it possible for a broader set of startups to access foundational legal services and for those moving away from big law firms to increase their consumption,"" Mayer said.
""If your mission is to end the billable hour,"" she added, ""this is the place to start.""
Jacobs Stanton described Brown as a high-energy founder with ""a history of winning."" While at Harvard, Brown also started a pantsuit company after a frustrating search for something to wear to an interview.
Zooming out, Brown is part of a broader reshuffling in the legal profession.
At conferences and in online forums, talk of a Big Law exodus has gotten louder. More associates are stepping off the partner track to build the next generation of legal software. Startups such as Harvey, Norm Ai, and Legora are hiring ""legal engineers,"" with JDs preferred.
Soxton plans to start snapping up attorneys. For now, it has three software engineers on payroll and a roster of contracted attorneys working through a separate Massachusetts law firm. Brown said she's about to make her first full-time offer to a Big Law attorney.
""She is just a force of nature,"" Jacobs Stanton said.

Google is envisioning a future where almost every interaction you may have with the internet is hyper-personalized for you.
According to Google’s VP of product for Search, Robby Stein, most people use AI products not for general factual information but more so for advice and recommendations.
“They want to know where to eat for dinner, they want to know where to travel with their family,” Stein told the Limitless podcast last week. “So we think there’s a huge opportunity for our AI to know you better and then to be uniquely helpful because of that knowledge.”
For AI to get a better understanding of you, Stein says Google’s AI models would use connected services like Gmail so that it could paint a detailed picture of your likes and dislikes over time. Thanks to that, for example, the AI can serve you up targeted product releases that you might like.
AI is an existential topic for Google Search. Earlier this year, a judge ruled in favor of Google in an antitrust trial over its Search business, saying that “for the first time in over a decade,” AI made it so that “a product could emerge that will present a meaningful challenge to Google’s market dominance.” Google, it seems, might be seeing where the judge comes from as the tech giant ramped up its AI efforts, unveiling its latest Gemini model to great success and integrating it across the entire Google ecosystem.
Gemini is already integrated with Google Workspace apps like Gmail (where you’re personal correspondences), Calendar (which knows what you do, when, and where), and Drive (which may have your work documents or your personal photos). It is also available on Google Maps, YouTube, WhatsApp, Spotify, you name it.
The company also launched a new Chrome browser in September with Gemini integration throughout, including an agentic AI that can navigate the web and complete tasks on your behalf.
Stein’s vision of an internet that knows a lot about you is one where your interactions with Google won’t be confined to the specific instances you use the search engine, but rather as ongoing conversations. The example he gives is, say, you’re looking for a couch for your apartment. You’re going to gradually feed your AI information on what kind of couch you might be looking for, whenever it might pop into your head. The AI would remember these scattered bits of information, and more that it gathers from you via previous conversations and your activity on connected apps. And then one day, the perfect couch you are looking for goes on sale, and boom, the AI serves it up to you, perhaps via a push alert.
“I think thatâs more of how I think of the future of search than any one specific feature or single form factor,” Stein said.
Of course, some parts of the Google search experience would stay non-personalized, even in this vision, like when you go on the internet to look for simple, factual information, such as the height of the Empire State Building. But that’s not likely the majority, according to the Google executive.
“It’s almost weird not to personalize it,” Stein said.
This hyper-personalization would also be super beneficial for the company’s ad business. Stein announced just a few weeks ago that Google had “started some experiments on ads within AI Mode and within Google AI experiences.” AI-enhanced targeted ads are the name of the game, seeing that Google’s biggest digital ads competitor, Meta, announced its own foray into it just recently.
Google’s business decisions are consequential for the entire web as the company’s products hold the power to alter the way we interact with the internet. Their search engines are the average user’s gateway to the internet; meanwhile, the company’s AI business is making great strides and outperforming competitors.
Personalization sounds great on paper, and it promises to make life easier on multiple fronts. But, like many other technological advancements of our day and age, it undeniably comes with risks. The more an AI system knows about you, the bigger the security risk of any potential data breach or sale becomes.
Even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has admitted the risks of letting AI models learn all about you.
“There’s two things that people really love right now that taken together are a real security challenge. Number one, people love how personalized these models are getting,” Altman told Stanford University professor Dan Boneh last month. “And then number two is you can connect these models to other services.”
You can’t trust AI with this information the way that you could trust a fellow human, Altman said.
“If you tell your spouse a bunch of secrets, you can sort of trust that they will know in what context… what to tell to other people. The models don’t really do this very well yet,” Altman said. “So if you’re telling a model all about your private healthcare issues, and then you have it buying something for you, you don’t want that e-commerce site to know about all of your health issues.”

Nvidia has been under pressure in recent weeks amid a rethink of the AI trade, but one top bank says investors don't have much of a reason to worry about the chip king. 
Nvidia stock is down 9% over the last month. Even its blockbuster third-quarter earnings failed to generate new excitement for the company and the broader AI sector. Big-name investors like Peter Thiel and SoftBank have dumped the stock, adding pressure. 
But Morgan Stanley's Joseph Moore this week pushed back on the downbeat narratives, increasing the bank's price target for the stock to $250 from $235 on Monday. The new target is among the highest on Wall Street, and implies a nearly 40% jump from current levels. 
Moore said that he thinks threats to the AI leader's market share, specifically those in Asian markets, are overstated.
Speculation that Nvidia's dominance in the AI market may be threatened isn't new. Ever since the AI leader shot to the top of the tech sector following the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, investors have wondered how long it can maintain the rank as the top AI hardware maker. 
Morgan Stanley doesn't see any other chipmakers as posing a significant threat to Nvidia, though, even as China prioritizes building out its own domestic semiconductor supply chain. The analysts recently visited Asia and shared their take on why Nvidia shouldn't be worried about competition from the east.
""While there is much attention being paid to Chinese AI solutions, we think that they are very limited on multiple levels, including cluster size and scale out technologies, and China software still would like access to western solutions,"" the analysts stated in a note on Monday.
Moore also said his team reconciled the ambitious $500 billion estimate for chip revenue given by CEO Jensen Huang at Nvidia's GTC event in October. 
""Having met with several contacts in both Asia and in the US, we are comfortable increasing estimates to get revenues to that level.""
While the analysts increased their price targets for both Nvidia and fellow chipmaker Broadcom, they said they still see Nvidia as the sector's clear winner.
""We model for AVGO and AMD to grow their AI processor revenues slightly faster than NVDA in CY26, but that mostly just reflects supply chain limitations of a $205 bn run rate revenue stream - all key products are supply constrained through 2026,"" the note stated.
The analysts are convinced that even as competition in the AI chip market intensifies, Nvidia will still maintain the best performance-to-cost ratio and be able to access a wider range of AI applications and workloads than its competitors.

Most parents have faced the tough moment when their child asks for a smartphone, and it feels like the only options are making them feel left out or giving them access to the whole internet. It’s a lose-lose scenario that HMD Global and Norwegian smartwatch brand Xplora are finally trying to fix.
Instead of cramming another budget Android device with TikTok-baiting features, the company has teamed up with Xplora to build a phone that tries the opposite approach. The new XploraOne drops social media entirely.
If the name sounds familiar, that’s because Xplora has spent years making kid-focused wearables. But this is its first step into feature phone territory. The XploraOne offers core functions, supporting messaging, calling, location tracking, and a simple camera, without added games or app stores.
The camera setup on the XploraOne Mini is simple, though exact specifications have not been shared. The focus is safety: parents can remotely manage contacts, approve calendar changes, set call restrictions, review messages, and access the child’s photo library.
The XploraOne builds on HMD and Xplora’s growing partnership, picking up where the HMD Fusion X1 left off. That earlier device set the tone for the collaboration by baking strong parental controls into a subscription setup that gave families tighter, app-level oversight.
There is no official price for the new kid-friendly phone yet, but Xplora may aim for the same market as its wearables. Parents who’ve been hunting for a phone that doesn’t feel like handing over the keys to the entire internet may want to keep an eye on this.

38,2025-12-02,"Germany is evaluating Apple's proposed changes to address antitrust concerns over App Tracking Transparency (ATT), reports Reuters. Apple plans to tweak the text and formatting of the ATT consent prompt, while aiming to preserve the main privacy benefits of the feature.
Apple will add neutral consent prompts for its own services and for third-party apps, aligning the wording, content, and visual design of the messages. Apple also plans to simplify the consent process to make it easier for developers to get user permission for ad-related data processing.
Germany is asking for feedback from publishers, media groups, and regulators to determine if Apple's changes will address complaints about the limited amount of user data available to app publishers.
Earlier this year, Apple said that it might have to remove ATT from the EU. ""Intense lobbying efforts in Germany, Italy and other countries in Europe may force us to withdraw this feature to the detriment of European consumers,"" Apple said.
Germany first launched a probe into App Tracking Transparency in 2022 after complaints from advertisers, and in February 2025, the German Federal Cartel Office preliminarily decided that Apple abused its market power, giving itself preferential treatment. According to German regulators, Apple's restrictions made it ""far more difficult"" for developers to access user data relevant for advertising.
Introduced in 2021, App Tracking Transparency lets iPhone and iPad users decide whether to allow apps to track their activity across other apps and websites for advertising purposes. Users can choose to allow apps to ask for permission, or turn off tracking entirely.
ATT prevents apps from accessing the advertising identifier of Apple devices without express consumer permission, so apps can't track what users do and use that data for ad targeting. ATT has been unpopular with advertisers and data brokers, but Apple has pledged to work to convince Germany and other EU countries to allow it to continue to offer ATT to consumers.

The market is flooded with charging cables and MagSafe chargers. But both standalone ones only add to the inconvenience of carrying them. The endless toil in the bag for a cable is an everyday chore for me. I’m sure many of you have fished endlessly at the bottom of the backpack/handbag for a charging cable? To find a solution to this problem, I was scrolling through options for accessories with built-in charging cables, when I came across this interesting project for a MagSafe Multipurpose Charging Cable Case on Behance.
It is designed like a hand grip mobile holder, which I first presumed this guy to be, until I saw the dangling cable and thought there was more to it than its design. The cable case is designed in a way to store a charging cable within a MagSafe-compatible accessory. Sounds unfamiliar? It probably is, I haven’t seen a similar concept before.
Designer: Jinkyo Han







If you look over the last decade, charging cables (which still remain important after wireless charging and MagSafe options) haven’t meaningfully changed. Of course, universal acceptance of USB-C cable does help, but the standardization doesn’t stop the cables from tangling and getting lost in the bag. Maybe, a MagSafe case that allows the changing cable to literally attach to the back of your iPhone, could, in a way limit that.







Therefore, Jinkyo has conceived this idea with a focus on convenience: “easy portability and instant charging when needed.” The accessory – called UNTITLE 1-219 – as imprinted on it, is divided into three parts, the MagSafe cable case, the changing cable that coils within it, and the clip end, which secures the dangling USB-A and USB-C ends on either side. This design does not consider the case and the cable as two easily lost appendages, instead imagines it as a MagSafe-compatible puck that snaps to the back of your phone and doubles as a storage, allowing changing cable to be coiled right inside; so, you can pull it out when you need to power your device.



And when you’re not using it, the case becomes a bit of drop prevention for the iPhone. The accessory may seem like a small – even useless – tweak to some, but for me, it is an accessory that has the potential to evolve past the drawing board. The idea of allowing the changing case to live on the phone instead of in the backpack is a logical option to the problem of tangling and lost cables. But how thick would this accessory make the phone and how much of an inconvenience it will be in daily usage, is, of course questionable. From where I see though, this accessory would mean one less thing to buy or lose.

Basic data-labeling work — the kind built on tagging images or sorting text — is becoming obsolete, said the CEO of a $2.2 billion AI training firm.
Jonathan Siddharth, the CEO of Turing, said on an episode of the ""20VC"" podcast published Monday that ""the era of data-labeling companies is over.""
""Data needs have significantly changed,"" said Siddharth. Early models relied on annotators tagging images, classifying text, or performing simple tasks that could be outsourced at scale. Today's systems, like agentic models and reinforcement-learning architectures, require more complex data, he added.
""It's more real-world data, data that touches how real humans do knowledge work,"" Siddharth said, adding that major labs want to work with AI training companies that can be a ""proactive research partner for them.""
""It's now the era of research accelerators,"" he said.
Siddharth said AI training companies need to focus on building a reinforcement-learning environment — simulated mini-worlds — that replicate human workflows across different industries. 
To do that, AI training companies must recruit human experts in various domains, Siddharth said. 
Turing announced in June that it had raised $111 million in Series E funding at a valuation of $2.2 billion. Earlier this year, the AI training firm said its annual revenue run rate reached $300 million in 2024 — nearly triple the year before.
AI data-labeling startups have been garnering massive valuations over the past year.
In June, Meta acquired a 49% stake in Scale AI, valuing the company at over $29 billion. Mercor said in October that it closed a funding deal valuing the startup at $10 billion.
The AI training boom has also fueled a fast-growing freelance workforce. Business Insider reported in September that several freelancers and contractors said that their AI training work has provided them with thousands of dollars a month, although it can be disturbing and unpredictable. Business Insider spoke with more than 60 data labelers about their work experiences.
The demand for AI training has also created an underground market for access to these platforms. Business Insider reported on Monday that it uncovered more than 100 Facebook groups selling unauthorized access to real and fake contractor accounts. Although reselling accounts is prohibited by AI-training companies, scammers and opportunistic gig-seekers are cashing in on the growing demand for AI-training gigs.

After months of buildup and teasers, Samsung has finally launched the Galaxy Z TriFold, its first multifolding device. It’s an impressive phone-tablet hybrid, allowing users to enjoy the best of both worlds, as long as they are okay with the phone’s hefty weight. If the Galaxy Z TriFold sounds interesting to you, here are all the countries where the Galaxy Z TriFold will be available!
Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority?
The Galaxy Z TriFold is set to launch first in South Korea on December 12, 2025. Beyond this, the foldable will be making its way to China, Taiwan, Singapore, the UAE, and the US.
Samsung has not provided a timeline for regions outside the US, but has confirmed that the TriFold will be available in the US during the first quarter of 2026. However, pricing details are still pending.
Samsung says that users will be able to try out the Galaxy Z TriFold in select retail stores in these launch countries for a quick hands-on with the exciting form factor.
Customers who purchase the Galaxy Z TriFold will receive a six-month trial of Google AI Pro, providing access to powerful Gemini features, including Nano Banana Pro for image generation and Veo3 for video generation, as well as 2TB of cloud storage.
Samsung is also introducing an exclusive display repair benefit for the Galaxy Z TriFold. Every Galaxy Z TriFold purchaser will be eligible for a one-time 50% discount on display repair costs. This is likely much needed, as the displays on the Z TriFold constitute a significant cost component, and customers would otherwise face sticker shock at the estimated repair price.
The display repair benefit also suggests that Samsung anticipates some teething issues and complaints arising with the TriFold. Samsung’s first-generation Galaxy Fold also faced display issues, so users spending so much money on the TriFold should take note that it is indeed a risky purchase, being a first-generation, bleeding-edge product.

Most Americans don't eat enough fiber. As a result, they miss out on its many benefits, including supporting heart and gut health, lowering cholesterol, managing weight, and reducing the risk of colon cancer.
If you feel tempted to stock up on soluble fiber — say, by adding beans to every meal — you might want to take your foot off the gas. Literally.
""Many people can experience gas or bloating when they increase fiber too quickly,"" Michelle Routhenstein, a preventive cardiology dietitian, told Business Insider. Eating too much fiber too quickly can cause more intense symptoms of gastrointestinal distress, like constipation, abdominal pain, and nausea.
Routhenstein works with her clients to gradually introduce more fiber to their diets until they reach their daily goal — 25 grams for women and 38 grams for men.
Here are a few of Routhenstein's tips on how to sneak in more fiber — without any discouraging stomach pains.
Routhenstein recommends starting by adding fiber to one meal a day at a time.
""Choose foods you already enjoy and tolerate well, then build from there,"" she said.
If you're very new to eating fiber (or have a history of it causing gassiness and bloating), some easy additions include:
Eventually, the goal is to ramp up your fiber intake — like adding fresh fruit to that morning yogurt, snacking on raw carrots, and having at least two servings of vegetables for dinner.
Besides watching your diet, Routhenstein said there are a few other ways to avoid fiber-related bloating.
Staying hydrated and drinking plenty of water aids digestion and helps prevent constipation.
Exercise can also help. Routhenstein recommended easy walks after meals, which also improves digestion.
How long it takes for your body to get used to your daily recommended fiber intake all depends on where you start, Routhenstein said.
If you're someone who already eats some fiber, the transition can take a few weeks with a steady increase of salads and fruit.
But if you almost never eat fiber, your gut microbiome is likely less equipped to handle a sudden fiber introduction, she said. ""In those cases, it can take six months or more to rebuild the microbial diversity needed to comfortably tolerate higher fiber levels.""
No matter where you begin, the key is to go slow and not give up.
""The focus isn't on racing to the 'end goal,'"" she said, ""but on making small, consistent daily adjustments that support long-term digestive health and a sustainable heart-healthy lifestyle.""

Samsung's Galaxy Z TriFold is no longer a secret. Samsung officially unveiled the device on December 1, 2025, and even though it won't launch in the U.S. until early 2026, a new video has shown what to expect when it finally goes on sale.
Popular YouTuber Mrwhosetheboss went hands-on with the Galaxy Z TriFold shortly after Samsung revealed it. The video covers everything, including the unboxing, design and build, software experience, internal hardware, and what it's actually like to use the phone.
The video starts with a quick unboxing of the trifolding phone. Arun (Mrwhosetheboss) notes that while most modern Samsung phones ship in small boxes, the Galaxy Z TriFold arrives in a much larger box. It's similar to what Samsung did with the first Galaxy Z Fold, using a big box to deliver a more premium first impression.
Inside the box, you get the Galaxy Z TriFold laid out fully unfolded, a SIM ejector, a USB-C cable, and a slim case made to cover the device's spine for protection when closed. A rare addition is a 45 W charger included in the box, something missing from devices like the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Given the price, though, this inclusion is expected.
In terms of first impressions, when folded, the cover screen looks similar to the 6.5-inch outer display of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 with comparable bezels. However, the video notes that the device is quite heavy at 309 g, making it much heavier than the Z Fold 7.
When fully unfolded, the Galaxy Z TriFold becomes an extremely slim device measuring just 3.9 mm at its thinnest point. Since it uses a U-shaped tri-fold design, both sides fold inward individually toward the center, and the video even shows an animation that appears if you fold it incorrectly.
Once unfolded, the device offers a big 10.1-inch 16:11 display similar to an Android tablet. Arun notes that this improves app usability and information density compared to current foldables. Apps like Samsung Health, Files, and YouTube take full advantage of the larger canvas with optimized layouts and more visible content.

Samsung mentioned in its press release that the Galaxy Z TriFold is the first device with standalone Samsung DeX, and the video confirms it completely transforms the phone into a full computing device. It supports resizable windows, multi-app layouts, and a full desktop-style environment.
All things considered, the Galaxy Z TriFold looks like a promising device based on the video. It costs about $2,400 in Korea and goes on sale starting December 12, 2025. There's no U.S. pricing yet, but the foldable will likely cost slightly more than in Samsung's home market.

50,2025-12-02,"A well-known security researcher reports that Apple has slashed its bounties for finding vulnerabilities in macOS. Many have been halved, with one of them reduced from over $30k to just $5k, despite a growing problem with Mac malware.
Csaba Fitzl, principal macOS security researcher at Iru, says it suggests Apple doesn’t really care about the Mac, and increases the likelihood that vulnerabilities will be sold on the black market instead of reported to the company … 
Fitzl posted examples of the new rates on LinkedIn.
Full TCC (privacy) bypasses are down from 30.5k to 5k. Hard to interpret this in a good way. It feels like:
Individual TCC categories are also down from 5-10k to 1k.
This feels really weird especially because Apple’s mantra is privacy…
macOS sandbox escapes are also down to 5k from 10k.
We verified that the rates he cited are accurate.
TCC refers to Apple’s Transparency, Consent, and Control framework. These are the mechanisms ensuring that apps can only access sensitive personal data if they have explicit user permission. A full TCC bypass would allow an app to gain access to a Mac user’s private information without consent.
Among other things, TCC protects access to:
Security researchers have discovered a number of serious TCC vulnerabilities in the past. One example allowed an attacker to modify the consent database so that macOS thinks a user has provided permission when they haven’t. Another was a code injection attack which allowed a rogue app to take advantage of TCC permissions already granted to a legitimate app.
Fitzl notes that not many security researchers focus on the Mac platform, and with even smaller awards on offer that number is likely to further diminish. It also increases the risk that anyone discovering an exploit will decide to sell it on the black market rather than report it to Apple.
It seems inexplicable that the company would make these changes at a time when there is more Mac malware than ever before. We’ve reached out to Apple for comment and will update with any response.

51,2025-12-02,"Thanks to Apple’s popular iPhone 17,  the company is on track to ship more smartphones than rival Samsung for the first time in 14 years, according to a report from CNBC.
Counterpoint Research projects that Apple will ship about 243 million phones to retailers this year, capturing 19.4% of the global market. 
Samsung will come in just behind Apple, with 235 million phones shipped, giving it an 18.7% global market share, per the report. 
A favorable upgrade cycle, plus an expected lower-cost entry-level iPhone next year, are among the factors expected to keep Apple in the lead for the next few years.

A flurry of product announcements from the developer conference in Las Vegas present a road map for Amazon’s AI computing dominance. 
In October, Amazon AWS suffered a major outage,  disrupting services for Snapchat, Reddit, Roblox, Venmo, and United Airlines, among others. 
As more and more businesses move their cloud computing to AWS or Google Cloud, the risks of such large outages increase. 
To address this, an unusual partnership between rivals AWS and Google seeks to let customers quickly and easily move their data and services between the platforms. 
In a press release, Robert Kennedy, VP of network services at AWS, said: 
“This collaboration between AWS and Google Cloud represents a fundamental shift in multicloud connectivity. By defining and publishing a standard that removes the complexity of any physical components for customers, with high availability and security fused into that standard, customers no longer need to worry about any heavy lifting to create their desired connectivity. When they need multicloud connectivity, it’s ready to activate in minutes with a simple point and click.”

Tesla sales from its Shanghai plant jumped 10% in November, only the third time those sales have risen in a month this year, Bloomberg reports. These figures don’t break down what share of sales are within China — Tesla’s second-biggest market — or exported, but typically most made there are sold locally.
The news is a rare bright spot these days for the company’s car sales, which are continuing to decline in much of the world amid fierce competition, especially from Chinese automakers, against Tesla’s aging lineup. The FactSet analyst consensus expects Tesla’s global sales to drop 7% in 2025, the second annual decline in a row. 
Yesterday, Apple announced that its AI head, John Giannandrea, who presided over the company’s largely subpar endeavors into generative AI, would retire at the relatively young age of 60.
Giannandrea is set to leave the company this spring — right around the time Apple’s long-delayed, AI-powered Siri is expected to debut, with Microsoft’s corporate VP for AI, Amar Subramanya, taking the reins.
The move signals that Apple, which has invested far less in AI than its Big Tech peers — and has comparatively little to show for it — is finally getting serious about the technology. 
“We believe that Subramanya represents the right hire at the right time with the clock ticking on Apple’s AI strategy heading into next year with outside hires a necessary move to improve the AI strategy,” writes Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. “We believe that this was a major reset while expecting more outside hires from Cook & Co. to get Apple on the right track when it comes to AI while further preparing the company for its AI Siri launch by mid 2026 which has been delayed due to development challenges and now represents a major turning point in the company’s history.”
The company put it this way: “This moment marks an exciting new chapter as Apple strengthens its commitment to shaping the future of AI for users everywhere.”

Google’s recent AI hot streak, which includes the much-lauded release of Gemini 3 last month, has OpenAI worried — so much so that CEO Sam Altman has declared a “code red” to improve its flagship product, ChatGPT, The Wall Street Journal reports.

Michael and Susan Dell are pledging to invest billions of dollars into ""Trump accounts,"" which will also receive a $1,000 seed from the federal government.
For Dell, $1,000 has a special resonance.
It's the same amount of money that he initially invested in his company, Dell Technologies, as a student at the University of Texas in 1984. Today, the entrepreneur is the 11th wealthiest person in the world, according to Bloomberg's Billionaires Index, with a net worth of $148 billion as of December 1.
In his 2021 book, ""Play Nice but Win,"" Dell marvels at the early success of his business despite its relatively modest initial investment.
""Our sales were growing by the week, as was our ragtag band of mercenaries and buccaneers. On the face of it, it made no sense,"" Dell wrote. ""Here I was, twenty years old, a college dropout with a capital base of $1,000, saying: 'Hey, who wants to come work in this company?'""
Dell launched the company in 1984 as PC's Limited. It became one of the fastest growing companies in the country, raking in more than $6 million in sales in its first year of business. The company was renamed to Dell Computer Corp. a few years later in 1987, and went public in 1988, raising $30 million.
Today, Dell Technologies has a market cap of $90.6 billion.
In 1999, Dell revisited his old dorm room and was photographed in it.
Of course, $1,000 isn't quite what it used to be: That amount in 1984 is the equivalent of nearly $3,200 today, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics's Inflation Calculator.
""Trump accounts"" are guided by the idea that a modest initial investment can grow over time and serve as a way for younger Americans to grow wealth.
""It enables every newborn child in America to experience the enormous benefits of compounded growth, and to accumulate significant resources with the passage of time,"" Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, an early proponent of the idea, told Business Insider in May. ""It creates a generation of new capitalists.""
The Dells are pledging a total of $6.25 billion in charitable contributions to Trump accounts.
In addition to the $1,000 from the government, the Dells will pay $250 into the accounts of children who are 10 years or younger, born before January 1, 2025, and who live in zip codes where the median income is $150,000 or less.
Dell has also said that his company will match the $1,000 contribution from the federal government for Dell employees.

TVs no longer have the audience's undivided attention.
Nearly 70% of US social media users scroll their feeds while consuming other media like TV, the market research firm YouGov found in a spring 2025 survey. Millennials were most likely to multitask, followed by Gen Zers.
The popularity of ""second-screen"" scrolling may sound like trouble for Tubi, the free streaming service that's especially popular with young audiences.
However, Tubi marketing chief Nicole Parlapiano said she views it as an ""additive"" opportunity rather than something ""disruptive"" to the business.
One way Tubi is trying to capitalize is with shoppable ads. The free streamer has interactive spots with call-to-actions like QR codes that allow viewers to point their phone camera at their TV screen to learn more about an ad. Other streamers have implemented similar ad tech, including Disney+ and Hulu.
""When someone's watching something, they're able to tap into their phones and access and shop,"" Parlapiano said.
About 42% of marketers use interactive ads in their connected TV or social media ad strategies, Business Insider sister company EMARKETER found in October. Ads with QR codes or gamified elements were 36% more likely to be remembered unprompted by audiences. Interactive ads also significantly improved brand affinity, or the emotional bond that viewers have with a brand, according to data from the ad research firm BrightLine cited by EMARKETER.
Parlapiano isn't alone in her optimism about shoppable ads in the age of second-screen scrolling.
""Advertisers shouldn't see Gen Z's second-screen behavior as a threat,"" said Ian Sharpe, the chief operating officer of media at travel tech company NextTrip. Instead, Sharpe called shoppable ads ""one of the biggest opportunities in modern media.""
Why?
""This generation is uniquely comfortable watching TV while browsing, searching, and buying on their phone, which means the ad experience naturally becomes shoppable,"" Sharpe said. ""Rather than hoping a viewer remembers an ad later, brands can now trigger immediate action through QR codes, social extensions, and direct commerce hooks.""
Shoppable ads are a broad opportunity, since it's not just teenagers who scroll while they watch, said Alicia Weaver, the vice president of media activation at media buying firm Mediassociates.
""This isn't an issue unique to Gen Z,"" Weaver said. She said she can find herself on her phone during commercials, sports games, or while texting friends during a reality show.
Weaver said that besides shoppable ads, another way to take advantage of second-screen viewing is cross-device retargeting data that lets marketers put ads on other devices or platforms.
""With this kind of usage likely here to stay, it becomes a matter of being savvy and innovative in how we reach audiences,"" Weaver said. ""We're not going to change consumer behavior, but we can absolutely innovate around it.""

Amazon orders keep getting faster.
The e-commerce juggernaut said Monday that it is making a big push into ultrafast fulfillment with new 30-minute delivery tests in Seattle and Philadelphia.
Through the new service, dubbed Amazon Now, customers can choose from thousands of essentials, such as diapers, milk, pet food, electronics, and more, delivered right to their doorstep in under half an hour.
In the Seattle test, Amazon workers pick and bag items at its warehouse, which are then handed off to Amazon Flex drivers who are expected to collect orders and get going within two minutes, tech news site GeekWire reported last week, citing Amazon's permit application filings in Seattle.
While Amazon is the biggest player in e-commerce in terms of sheer volume, the company is still catching up with retail giant Walmart in terms of speed.
Powered by its fleet of more than 4,600 stores in the US, Walmart is within a three-hour delivery reach of roughly 95% of American households.
The company also said more than a third of shoppers pay an additional fee to have their orders delivered in less than an hour, and it routinely fulfills orders in a matter of minutes.
For example, Walmart said its fastest delivery on Black Friday was a Shark Steam & Scrub Mop to a shopper in Utah.
Of course, Amazon hasn't been sitting still.
In June, the company began adding 4,000 ""smaller"" communities to its same-day fulfillment service by stocking more everyday essentials at strategically located delivery stations around the US.
As for the question of whether US retailers will start promising 15-minute delivery (or even shorter), supply chain consultant Ralph Asher previously told Business Insider the laws of physics and finance could prove to be real constraints.
For example, Asher modeled a 30-minute delivery concept for Minneapolis and found that four fulfillment stations were needed to serve the metro area. Getting fulfillment down to 15 minutes required a whopping 31 centers, each of which would have to be stocked with sufficient inventory to meet demand.
""You need more and more expensive equipment to do it, you need more and more inventory, you need more and more real estate, you need more and more drivers willing to drop everything at a moment's notice to do delivery,"" he said.
""There's just probably not as much of a market for anything under 30 minutes,"" he added.

It’s got all the goodies ... 4 bedrooms, 4 baths, with bright, open interiors, and a private primary suite that doubles as its own chill retreat with direct access to that iconic backyard.
Of course, that pool is the real showstopper -- every entertainer’s dream centerpiece.

There's nothing better than coming home to the comforting aroma of beef stew or pasta sauce simmering in a Crock-Pot, especially on cozy days in the fall and winter.
As the weather turns even cooler, it's the perfect time to bring out your Crock-Pot or slow cooker to prepare hearty meals that cook on their own during the workday.
Business Insider spoke with chefs and cookbook authors about their favorite comforting slow-cooker meals, from hearty beef stews and chowders to brisket, and researched celebrity chefs' go-to Crock-Pot dishes. 
Here are 17 cozy comfort-food dishes you can make in a slow cooker, according to chefs.
Short ribs are one of cookbook author Kim Laidlaw's favorite things to make in a Crock-Pot, and they're a go-to on a chilly day.
In her cookbook, ""Everyday Slow Cooking: Modern Recipes for Delicious Meals,"" Laidlaw gives multiple different recipes for short ribs, and she recommends trying them for a meal featuring other sides.
""If you do them in a slow cooker, then the meat is out of the way,"" she told Business Insider. ""Then, you can focus on other side dishes like polenta or risotto.""
Beef, turkey, or chicken stew is a perfect stick-to-your-bones meal during the fall or winter months.
""Beef stew is really nice in the slow cooker,"" Laidlaw said. ""That's something I grew up on with the slow cooker, and it's just as good today.""
But stew is also hassle-free.
""Slow cookers are perfect in the winter for soups and stews,"" Laidlaw said. ""The best part is that you can set it in the morning and walk away.""
If you make this chowder in the fall, you can use in-season fresh corn as is suggested in this celebrity chef-approved Martha Stewart recipe, found on the chef's website.
However, you can also take the easy route by choosing canned corn from the store. The chowder is flavorful yet light and uses heartwarming ingredients like heavy cream, bacon, and baby red potatoes.
Laidlaw's recipe for slow-cooked braised brisket includes garlic, onion, dry red wine, carrot, and chicken or beef stock, with a chimichurri sauce.
""Brisket is a natural partner for the slow cooker, as a gentle braise renders it meltingly tender,"" Laidlaw writes in ""Everyday Slow Cooking.""
""Ribs do really well in the slow cooker, and you can always stick them under the broiler in the end to crisp them up,"" Laidlaw said.
""Bolognese is great because you can cook it for a long time,"" Laidlaw said. ""You just have to remember that the sauce doesn't evaporate the same as it would if you were doing it on the stove. You definitely need to compensate and put less liquid in the pot if you're using a slow cooker.""
Celebrity chef Martha Stewart's recipe for slow-cooker mac and cheese is not only easy to make but super delicious and perfect for the fall and winter seasons.
""It is important to use pungent cheeses, such as sharp cheddar, mixed with a little Gruyere or pecorino Romano for extra bite, since the white sauce and pasta will absorb a lot of flavor,"" Stewart writes.
Hugh Acheson's slow-cooker chicken broth is pretty simple — all you'll need is a whole chicken, salt, garlic cloves, white onions, carrots, celery, and a few seasonings to taste. 
You can find the full recipe for Acheson's chicken broth in his book, ""The Chef and the Slow Cooker.""
""A simple soup with Thai chilis, coconut milk, and lime is just wickedly good,"" Acheson said.
The recipe for Acheson's slow cooker chicken soup with chiles, coconut milk, and lime can be found here on Garden & Gun. Or, if you're feeling a little more adventurous, Acheson also said a slow cooker is a perfect way to make delicious chicken and dumplings.
Acheson points out that not only are meatballs, like the veal meatballs he includes in his book, easy and delicious to make, but they're a comforting, kid-friendly option you can make in a slow cooker.
""Slow cookers are not necessarily the best tool for cooking for one — they work so much better for nourishing an entire family,"" he said.
""I usually go for something that won't take too long,"" Acheson said. ""Usually, I go for a lentil soup with Tuscan kale and a little sour cream and herbs on top. To me, that's the type of food you want as you're watching the snow fall down.""
The recipe for Acheson's lentil soup with Tuscan kale can be found here on Cup of Jo.
Acheson also points out that large batches of soup are great for the next day.
One of the benefits of using a slow cooker is starting with a basic protein and jazzing it up.
From Mexican food-inspired spices to Indian simmer sauces, there are tons of ways to transform simple braised or pulled chicken dishes into something show-stopping.
This recipe from Delish tells you how to make slow-cooker barbecue pulled chicken.
""One dish I think is so versatile is pork shoulder in a slow cooker with broth and a little salt and pepper,"" Laidlaw said. ""I just braise that and then you can turn into so many different things.""
Laidlaw said that using a pork shoulder, you can make everything from pulled-pork sliders to carnitas tacos or burritos.
""Leg of lamb is so good as it breaks down in the slow cooker,"" Acheson said. ""Cooking in the slow cooker and then finishing another way is going to make sure your meat is at its best. Whether that means re-searing the meat or throwing it under the broiler, you might want to think about other steps to really finish off your meal.""
Laidlaw added, ""Recipes that have you throw everything in without any prep ahead are not nearly as good or as flavorful as the ones that do. Taking ten minutes to brown the meat before you put it in or getting the onions started goes a long way to making your meals more delicious.""
""It's really about rethinking recipes and figuring out how to do it in the slow cooker,"" Acheson said.
One of the ""best recipes"" Acheson said he uses from his book is one for a braised catfish stew, the recipe for which can be found on Garden & Gun.
""It's got this long-cooking, beautiful broth that's just a vision at the end,"" he told Business Insider. ""It's got chilies, peppers, and mace — big flavors. It just works perfectly. When slow cooking, you really want to choose a dish that works well simmering potentially all day.""
""These days, goat shoulder doesn't have that gamey taste it might have had before,"" Acheson said. ""When you're talking about cooking a large piece of meat, a slow cooker is a great place to start.""
One of the desserts Laidlaw includes in her book ""Everyday Slow Cooking"" is for gingersnap-brandy cheesecake, which would be perfect as a treat on a cold day or even a holiday dessert.

58,2025-12-02,Wall Street is eyeing a comeback as the flight from risk starts to cool.
59,2025-12-02,"A familiar voice is reportedly ready to return to WFAN soon, leading to a shift in afternoon programming at the sports station.
According to The Athletic’s Andrew Marchand, Craig Carton and the station are close to finalizing a deal that would bring him back to WFAN for a third time. Carton’s new show will have a co-host, with overnight host Chris McMonigle as the leading candidate, though others are being considered.
Marchand added that Carton’s return will shift the “Evan and Tiki” show from its current spot to the 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. slot. With these moves, Brandon Tierney and Sal Licata will no longer be part of the regular weekday schedule.
Reports surfaced in July that Carton could make a return to WFAN, with Marchand pointing to the connection Carton had with a station executive as a potential path for his comeback.
“A return to WFAN is not out of the question for Carton,” Marchand said in July. “WFAN has continued its dominance in the market with Tiki Barber joining Carton’s former partner, Evan Roberts, on afternoon drive. Chris Oliviero, who brought Carton back to WFAN after Carton served a prison sentence for fraud, is the chief business officer of the station’s parent company, Audacy, and oversees WFAN.”
Carton, 56, initially joined WFAN in 2007, working with Boomer Esiason. The two remained together until Carton was arrested in 2017 on federal charges related to a ticket scheme that used money to pay off his gambling debts. Carton was sentenced to three and a half years in prison but served slightly more than a year before being released for good behavior. 
Carton returned to WFAN in 2020 but left again in 2023 and signed with FS1. He co-hosted the morning show ‘Breakfast Ball’ with Mark Schlereth and Danny Parkins on FS1, but the show was canceled in July. Carton subsequently created his daily podcast, “The Craig Carton Show.”

I hope you got to watch some football on Thanksgiving, because those games were too much fun. Here’s hoping Patrick Mahomes, Dak Prescott and others gave you small-talk fodder for those that needed it. Speaking of which, let’s get to those quarterbacks.
In these rankings, I’m focused on monitoring the fluctuations of a QB’s performance throughout the season. No one — not even Drake Maye — is safe at the top. No one — not even Max Brosmer — is stuck at the bottom. There is room for quick ascent — and rapid decline. One question holds most important: What have you done for your team lately?
Previous: Preseason, Week 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13
All I can say is that Smith can thank his lucky stars for Brock Bowers.
The star tight end is about the only thing that seems to be working for the Las Vegas Raiders offense. The removal of offensive coordinator Chip Kelly did not make things better. Here’s how Smith’s first five dropbacks went over the first three drives this past Sunday versus the Chargers:
Presumably, those were scripted plays, by the way. So with a week of planning, this was what the passing offense looked like. Yikes.
On the season, Smith is not playing well, particularly in the situations when his team is actually competitive. As the games drag on, he looks better in some of the same ways that Blake Bortles looked half-decent in 2015 when he racked up stats (4,428 passing yards, 35 TDs, 18 INTs) as teams blew out the Jaguars.
It’s hard to make sense of whether Smith is toast or coach Pete Carroll is toast — or both. But you can bet Smith won’t be the Raiders’ starter next year. And I don’t suspect he’ll win a starting job anywhere else, either.
Sanders is making a great case for Kevin Stefanski to land a better job next year. But Sanders has not yet made a great case for himself to land a better job next year.
Sanders should get until the end of the season to prove himself and develop as a passer. And — contrary to deep-reddit, tinfoil-hat theories — Stefanski seems to be doing everything he can to help his QB with playcalling and design. It’s just that, at times, Sanders isn’t helping himself yet. It’s clear that a big part of Sanders’ success is coming through the screen game. Look at his first touchdown pass last week, a 66-yarder to Dylan Sampson. Look at the five different screen passes the Browns ran against the 49ers.
Stefanski has turned the screen game into an offensive focal point to manufacture efficiency in a passing offense that’s otherwise experiencing issues — largely at the hands of Sanders, who hasn’t been an efficient passer on throws at or beyond the line of scrimmage.
It’s not just that he’s not completing throws. It’s also that he’s not attempting them, which could have been receiver Jerry Jeudy’s beef when the two got into what appeared to be an argument during Sunday’s game.
Teams are going to jump those screens. They’re going to give Sanders opportunities to go downfield. He needs to take them.

Running it back rarely works in the NFL.
It seems the Ravens are suffering from a lack of evolution. Perhaps because almost nothing changed from a personnel standpoint, things are falling apart around Lamar.
The offensive line that seemed questionable going into 2024 looked solid that year. But that same line that looked solid going into 2025 has turned questionable. Derrick Henry’s production looks good on paper, but the film shows the slightest evidence (but just enough to be significant) of Father Time. And while last year’s film looked like it had some hidden production that the Ravens could eke out this year, we’ve actually seen the opposite happen — a regression from supporting cast members like Zay Flowers, Rashod Bateman and Isaiah Likely.
So it all comes back to Lamar, who is trying to do more for his offense while fighting through injuries. The list is long and significant for a mobile QB: hamstring, toe, ankle, knee.
The expectation was that he’d return and do MVP things, because that’s what he’s always done. But he’s clearly never been this banged up. The Ravens could have withstood those injuries if their supporting cast rose to the occasion. Or they could have withstood the lackluster supporting cast without Lamar’s injuries.
The only good news is that, as much as things are going wrong in Baltimore, they have gone much, much worse elsewhere in their division. So the Ravens might limp into the playoffs anyway. 
Mahomes went into Josh Allen mode.
I know that’s a weird sentence. Because we’re accustomed to Allen going into Mahomes mode. But I think we all know what ""Allen mode"" looks like at this point, right? There’s a level of desperation blended with do-everything willingness blended with alien-level arm talent. And most important, there’s the element of having to carry the supporting cast — and to attempt throws that only two quarterbacks (Allen and Mahomes) would dare attempt.
Despite an incredible game from Mahomes, he lost. The irony is that Mahomes is playing at such a high level that he should be enjoying himself. His film is chock-full of incredible throws. And Mahomes has recently complained about how the recent regular seasons have been such a grind that they’re not as fun. But he was winning then. And now, with all this electric play, he’s losing.
And … I wonder: Is this even less fun?
The Panthers might not be a consistent team from week to week, but when they are playing well, they can beat anybody. So a win over the Panthers is a quality win. But of course, the Rams lost.
Does that make it a quality loss? In some ways, yes.
When it comes to bookmakers’ odds, Stafford’s MVP campaign slipped, because he threw two interceptions and lost a fumble — contributing to the Rams’ defeat. I’d actually argue this performance should help his MVP candidacy, in part because it showed that maybe the Rams aren’t quite as complete as we thought they were. And Stafford is playing a much bigger role in holding the team together than we originally believed. MVP voters probably won’t view it that way. But I view it that way.
Ultimately, this was an outlier game for Stafford, who has been the king of risk management. He’s been in the league a long time and might not have to do much to address the mistakes he made. The Rams are still the NFL’s best team. Now more than ever, he’s at the center of that.
You could see the respect that Prescott and coach Brian Schottenheimer had for the Chiefs defense. They dialed up a plan that had Prescott checking the ball down to his receivers on bubble screens, often to the left side, where they used their athleticism to generate YAC. If it wasn’t that, then the Cowboys had Prescott rolling to throw to horizontal route-runners.
And even after doing that for basically the entire first half, the Chiefs made Dak work hard for his throws over the middle. He put the ball in harm’s way at least four times and was lucky to only see one interception. He only attempted one pass beyond the 20-yard line — a deep ball to CeeDee Lamb for 51 yards.
Hey, you do what you can to beat the Chiefs. Because they’re going to do everything they can to stump you. Against KC, it’s a real credit to a QB who can be steady, particularly on third downs and particularly in the third quarter. That’s when DC Steve Spagnuolo turns into the Grim Reaper and Patrick Mahomes’ greatest lieutenant in comebacks. It’s Spags who generates the extra possessions for Mahomes to stay in the game.
But that’s where — credit to Prescott — he showed up. There was one third-down conversion in the low red zone that was particularly impressive, with the Cowboys QB rolling right and zipping the ball into a tight window.
The Chiefs are hard to beat. They’re hardest to beat when their backs are against the wall. That’s what Dak and Co. did.

62,2025-12-02,"The Indian government issued a mandate that intends to force smartphone companies like Apple and Samsung to preinstall a state-run security app called ‘Sanchar Saathi’ on phones sold in the region. The companies have 90 days to comply.
But Reuters reports Apple intends to refuse the order and will not install the app on iPhones. The company will tell the Indian government that it does not comply with such orders in any market in which it participates, due to the associated security and privacy risks. 
Of course, Apple may not be able to resist the government directive indefinitely, but it is significant that it is fighting rather than quietly conforming. We’ll have to wait and see how this plays out. 
Not only would the Sanchar Saathi app be pre-installed, an interpretation of the order suggests that the government also intends the app to be un-deletable by users. 
The app in question, Sanchar Saathi, is already available to users if they choose to download it from the App Store. It enables users to report lost or stolen handsets, and can trigger carrier requests to block the IMEI number. It also contains a facility to report scam or fraudulent phone calls. 
The government ostensibly wants to increase the distribution of the app to help fight crime, as criminals often clone or spoof valid IMEI numbers onto stolen phones. The main opposition political party says the mandate is unconstitutional.

69,2025-12-02,"Today’s announcement that Michael and Susan Dell will donate $6.25 billion to American families is, on the face of it, a rather remarkable figure–likely one of the largest donations ever made with American citizens as the direct beneficiaries. Sure, it’s only a drop in the bucket of the net worth of Dell Technologies chief executive Michael Dell, whose $148 billion valuation pegs him as the 11th richest individual in the world according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and sure, the gift comes with the name of Donald Trump very prominently attached to it, but it’s still likely a better outcome than the traditional billionaire status quo of simply piling all the cash in the form of a massive pool of gold coins to lap swim in, Scrooge McDuck-style. This particular donation is meant to fill in some of the obvious gaps created by the Trump administration’s stated plans to institute “Trump Accounts” to aid with family investing for newborns born between 2025-2028, but it should be noted that the same caveats should apply as have applied to so many past Trump promises to cut Americans a check: The man’s natural state of being is duplicity. Whenever it’s possible to not pay someone a promised sum, Trump rarely misses an opportunity to renege. Nor does the concept of the accounts take into consideration the current economic precariousness that may make it impossible for the majority of families to contribute their own savings to help it grow.
The concept of Trump Accounts–inevitably named because Trump can only pretend to care about altruism if his name is attached, like his insistence on adding his own name to COVID stimulus checks–was first broached in a June press conference, in which Trump described the provision of the “One Big Beautiful Bill” that would establish an investment account for every U.S. citizen child born between Jan. 2025 and Jan. 2029, with a $1,000 starting contribution from the U.S. government. This would seemingly be both an attempt at an incentive to get parents to have more children among Elon Musk-fueled concerns over declining birth rate, and a PR campaign for Trump himself, given that the pilot program is structured to immediately end after the 2028 presidential election.
Still, the fact that the program actually is funded via the passage of the massive (deficit-increasing, naturally) spending bill makes it much more likely that it will actually be seen through to some kind of implementation, currently scheduled to potentially begin opening accounts in mid-2026. They would essentially operate along the following lines:
— The government’s $1,000 contribution would be present when the account is opened for a child born between Jan. 2025 and Jan. 2029, invested into a diversified, low-cost U.S. stock index fund. Further contributions must be into similar index funds tied to the S&P 500.
— Parents, guardians or private entities can contribute up to $5,000 per year in additional dollars into the Trump Accounts, payments that are made with after-tax dollars, meaning that contributions to the funds are not tax-deductible. There are various provisions for employers, etc. to potentially be able to match contributions made by parents.
— Funds cannot be withdrawn until the age of 18, at which point the account can essentially be transitioned into a traditional IRA, and withdrawing the funds will result in a substantial tax payment on investment gains.
The $6.25 billion contribution of Michael and Susan Dell, meanwhile, isn’t intended for these kids born between 2025-2029 at all. Rather, it’s intended to bring up to 25 million additional U.S. children into some semblance of the program by creating Trump Accounts for kids up to 10 years of age who were born prior to the 2025 cut-off. Similar investment accounts would be created for them; albeit with less seed money: The Dell contribution provides for $250 to be placed as an initial investment into each account. Around 80% of children born between 2016-2024 would theoretically qualify, although there are cutoffs based on household income: Applying families would have to live in ZIP codes where the median household income is less than $150,000 per year.
Which is all to say: Thanks, I guess? We run into the issue of genuine practicality at this point: We’re talking about a gift of $250, thrown vaguely in the direction of millions of American families by members of our billionaire ruling class. What can that money realistically do in terms of providing for a child’s future? Is it the seed that is going to allow them to go to college, to buy a house some day? Does that really seem likely? Or are we primarily talking about billionaires running PR campaigns for a president who recently hit new second term lows in his overall approval numbers?
pro-trump asshole trying to curry favor with the president by giving to-be-determined kids pocket change to invest in the stock market that he and his billionaire friends are getting ready to crash for the third time in 20 years. thanks michael and susan

More than anything, the effectiveness of the Trump accounts is contingent upon whether Americans, their employers, etc., are able to continue to faithfully invest/pump money into them over the course of 18 years or more, which is a big ask. A little seed money from the government is a nice thing, but it will barely grow in any measurable way (perhaps not even keeping up with inflation) unless parents are able to continue adding funds to the account. The ease of creating said account is meant to encourage families to participate in saving, but do you know many families in 2025 that would describe themselves as having a spare $5,000 per year to immediately start investing in a government-backed investment account, even if that might be relatively sound financial strategy? Or are the families in your orbit already scraping to get by, without being able to commit much attention to investing in the future? Hell, how will those who do invest in their Trump Accounts feel when the A.I. bubble bursts and drags the stock market down into a deep pit of despair? As is so often the case, the families most benefited by the concept of Trump Accounts will be those ones who are already on the best financial footing, aka the wealthiest Americans. A more equitable system might have provided additional benefits specifically for low-income Americans, but the current blanket system was no doubt the only way to curry enough GOP support for the concept, which already has enough socialistic overtones to make traditional Republicans jumpy.
And not to be forgotten in all this is Trump’s own history of consistently invoking or outright promising direct economic hand-outs (ironically against all traditional GOP philosophy), only to then not take any steps toward actually delivering them. Remember back in February, when Trump was telling reporters that he “loved” Elon Musk’s proposal to send Americans $5,000 DOGE rebate checks, supposedly to be funded by savings generated by the Department of Government Efficiency cutting up to $2 trillion from the United States federal budget? When’s the last time you heard about that plan? Some nine months later, and with eight months left on its original charter, DOGE effectively no longer exists, its key employees having all been shuffled off to other lucrative governmental positions to continue their personal sponging while any “savings” created by the originally Elon-led agency have been impossible to quantify thanks to an almost complete lack of verifiable public disclosure. The fact that the tumult of the DOGE era ultimately resulted in an even bigger federal deficit than before should speak to the confidence level involved whenever Trump promises anything to Americans.
Most recently, that has been in the form of promising $2,000 “tariff rebate checks,” which Trump recently claimed could be distributed in mid-2026, no doubt in advance of midterm elections.
“We’ve taken in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariff money,” Trump said to reporters in late November. “We’re going to be issuing dividends … probably the middle of next year, a little bit later than that, of thousands of dollars for individuals of moderate income, middle income.”
Trump continues asking for cash from supporters while dangling $2,000 “tariff rebate checks” though his own Treas Sec AND members of his party in Congress have declared the desperate gimmick dead on arrival.

Of course, as can often be assumed with such Trump proclamations, the math behind such an idea doesn’t really add up. Currently, according to estimates from the Tax Foundation, Trump’s tariffs are projected to raise roughly $158 billion throughout 2025, and another $207 billion in 2026 … if they aren’t capriciously raised and lowered, as the president frequently indulges in. The cost of $2,000 checks, meanwhile, would almost certainly exceed the entirety of this income: If said checks went out only to tax filers and spouses the projected cost would be $279.8 billion. So much for tariffs as a revenue-generating tool for the country; you’re now deeply in the hole, something that Congressional Republicans would no doubt despise with every fiber of their being. And even if Trump did somehow muscle said “tariff rebate checks” through Congressional approval, they could still very well backfire by contributing to another surge in inflation, as followed the three rounds of COVID relief checks in 2020-2021. It’s far easier for talk of tariff checks for Americans to simply fade away like so many other Trump proclamations, replaced by the new shiny object of the week for the MAGA faithful to latch on to.
For the sake of young American families, we can only hope that some people do ultimately feel the benefit of these government-backed investment accounts even if they do come with Trump’s name forever welded to them. It is likely that–should the program survive, and not be torpedoed by Trump and Congress at some point–usage of these accounts in the intended fashion actually could help give families the necessary incentive to actively plan savings for a child’s future, taking advantage of compounding interest … provided that the same administration’s fumbling economic policy doesn’t tank the economy so badly that those families have no funds to contribute toward savings. It’s basically a chicken-and-egg scenario: If the Trump administration gives you a nest box in which to hatch your eggs, you might as well use it, provided of course that President Fox hasn’t already paid a visit to eat his fill.

This weekly guide sorts the very best from the rest when it comes to the saturated world of sneaker releases, with information on release dates and where to buy. Please note: Some sneakers may sell out at speed.
Raffles, friends and family releases, and player exclusives — all of that before a mere mention of the many fire general sneaker releases out there. The world of sneaker drops can be a tricky place to navigate, but we’re here to help. Behold, the best of the best of what's arriving on shop floors this week. 
This week’s selection sees new chapters in long-running collaborations — such as Nike x A Ma Maniére and adidas x Brain Dead — as well as an ASICS runner built like a leather dress shoe. 
The cream of the sneaker crop awaits you. What are you waiting for? 
Release Date: December 5 
Editor's Notes: Palace's UGG shoes tend to be graphic-heavy statement pieces. So, no surprises that this laterst release comes covered in embroidered characters. But getting animation powerhouse Warner Bros for a three-part Looney Tunes-themed link-up is an unexpected twist. 
Release Date: Available now
Editor's Notes: Salomon's XT-Whisper is getting into the holiday spirit. The shoe's breathable mesh is gone and, in its place, is a rustic tartan fleece fabric. It's an old-school trail shoe slipping into something cozy for colder days. 
Release Date: December 5
Editor's Notes: Forget about breathable mesh or sleek no-sew constructions,  ASICS SportStyle's newest runner has a more old-school approach to its fabrication. This is the first modern leather ASICS shoe from the stylish diffusion line.
Release Date: December 3
Editor's Notes: The first Brain Dead x adidas Japan sneakers, with their contrasting textures and suede flames running up the sides, were wild. This follow-up release, together with pioneering retailer Dover Street Market, is the same shoe. However, by virtue of being rendered entirely black, it's a little more wearable. 
Release Date: December 6
Editor's Notes: Atlanta-based retailer A Ma Maniére has been giving Nike icons luxurious makeovers for years. So, it was only a matter of time before the Air Jordan 6 got its turn. The formula remains unchanged, with upgraded materials like a buttery mauve suede and a quilted lining.
Release Date: Available now
Editor's Notes: The city comes alive at night. And this sneaker's reflective overlays and strong pops of color are a reflection of the energy that permeates after dark.
Release Date: December 5
Editor's Notes: Trust a boundary-pushing balletcore designer to deliver an unconventional balletcore shoe. SHUSHU/TONG’s latest collaboration with ASICS takes a bow, literally, placing one on a velcro strap over a silver upper, adding a soft, feminine edge to a classic runner.

                Early season snow has started to accumulate at Colorado's Arapahoe Basin ski area, as seen from nearby Loveland Pass on Thanksgiving weekend.

WHITEFISH, Mont. — A chairlift cranks into gear as a group of ski patrollers at Whitefish Mountain Resort gets the mountain ready for another season. 
This is a typical safety training. They'll practice how to evacuate people off chairs if there were an emergency. But not much here feels typical. For starters, no one is in boots or on skis. Despite the training happening in late November, there is no snow at the base lodge, and the slopes leading up the mountain are brown, which is adding to the broader anxiety in the resort tourism industry right now.
""Yeah, if we don't have snow, that's going to dictate how our season goes,"" says resort spokesman Chad Sokol.
Going into the Thanksgiving holiday — the traditional start to the ski season — resorts across the West delayed openings due to low or no snowfall, and many couldn't even make artificial snow due to the balmy weather. It's not clear how much of an effect this has had on winter bookings. 

                Ski patrollers at the Whitefish Mountain Resort in Montana conduct preseason trainings on Nov. 19.

The snow has finally started falling in the Rockies and Pacific Northwest this week, including in Whitefish. But the ski industry is also bracing for a continued drop in international guests due to President Trump's tariffs and his negative rhetoric about their countries.
The Whitefish Mountain Resort, long known locally as Big Mountain, sits about 60 miles south of the U.S.-Canada border and has historically gotten a quarter of its business from up north.
""We think of Canadians as our neighbors, and British Columbia and Alberta, we're right here — we're a border state,"" says Zak Anderson, executive director of Explore Whitefish, the local resort chamber.
Montana state tourism officials have tracked about a 25% drop in Canadian visitors since Trump slapped steep tariffs on Canada and suggested that it should become the 51st U.S. state. Locals are sad and frustrated.
""We don't have a say in, you know, national politics,"" Anderson says.
Canadian credit card spending is also down by 12% in Whitefish's upscale boutiques, restaurants and hotels. It's a big deal for a town with less than 10,000 people — and Anderson hopes Canadians will come back.
""You know, for a little community like ours, the message is, we're here — we're open for business,"" he says.
This anxiety extends far beyond the American ski industry. The U.S. Travel Association is projecting that 5 million fewer international visitors will visit the United States this year.
""I don't know if you'd call it a boycott, but definitely a growing attitude of disenfranchisement maybe,"" says Amir Eylon, president and CEO of Longwoods International.
Longwoods, a tourism market research firm, has been surveying Canadians monthly since last winter. Most are citing U.S. politics like the tariffs and Trump's rhetoric as the reason for canceling their trips. But nearly a majority have also consistently cited the weak Canadian dollar.
""You had many Canadian travelers that were already on the fence about coming to the U.S. just from their own financial perspective and then they're going to feel insulted or hurt,"" Eylon says. ""It makes it much easier for them to say: 'You know what? Not this year.'""

                Hotels in Kalispell, Mont., near the U.S.-Canada border, are offering discounts as part of a ""Welcome Back Canada"" campaign.

Small towns dependent on tourism are launching campaigns to entice Canadians back, including Kalispell, Mont., near Whitefish and Glacier National Park. Since it opened in 1912, the Kalispell Grand Hotel has been welcoming Canadian guests, says General Manager Mitchell Bump.
""Back in the day, it was kind of like the cowboys, you know, rugged people,"" Bump says, smiling.
Sixty-five percent of Flathead County voted for Trump last year. But they stand to take a big economic hit from the cross-border politics. The local chamber of commerce has launched a ""Welcome Back Canada"" initiative. Canadians get 20% off hotel rooms in the city. Bump and his staff were eager to take part in the promotion.
""I'm a hotel manager, so, like, not really a politician. Our job is to take care of guests and keep rooms filled year-round, especially in shoulder season, and that's really the lens I'm looking through,"" Bump says.
Back in Whitefish, no one is really sure how many Canadians will show up this winter. The ski resort is coming off its second-busiest season on record, though. Sokol, the resort's spokesman, says the tariffs hit after some of the resort's busiest, most important weekends.
""So our busy periods were already behind us at that point,"" he says.
Christmas week is often the make-or-break time for resorts, and local bookings for the upcoming holidays look solid.
Anderson, at Explore Whitefish, says the drop in Canadian business this year for now has been buffered by a spike in domestic tourists and Montana's population boom since the COVID-19 pandemic. But he says that even domestic tourists are tending to book at the last minute and that's hard for businesses to plan for.
""There's so much uncertainty — it's hard to know what's going to happen,"" Anderson says. ""The political winds seem to be shifting on an hourly basis.""

74,2025-12-02,"Ford is discontinuing its Focus, a compact car that has been around since 1998. The final Focus was completed in early November 2025 at the German Saarlouis plant. A round of applause from employees as it rolled off the line marked the end of an era for the automaker. Ford has now updated its website to officially confirm that no more Focus vehicles will be built.
The Focus has seen various transformations across its lifespan. It typically has come in sedan and hatchback styles, and in later years embraced technology integration — even though Ford isn't embracing Apple CarPlay Ultra. Often offered at an affordable price, some saw it as an excellent family car to get around town. 
Ford customers are now left wondering what is next for the automaker. It has been turning its attention to electric vehicles (EV) with ambitious plans on building manufacturing plants. However, not all of Ford's EVs have lasted long on the market, and new developments have been experiencing delays. For now, Ford is left with a gap in its car lineup that nothing in the near future appears ready to fill.
Ford's push into EVs hasn't always turned out the best, as some vehicles were short-lived like the Ranger EV. The company was working on a manufacturing facility in Tennessee with the purpose of creating EVs and their batteries. However, production is on pause. In August 2025, Ford announced ambitious plans, led by a $5 billion investment in reworking its operations. The purpose is to create EVs that are more affordable than what is currently on the market, since they tend to be priced higher than gas-powered cars. 
It will also build a battery plant in Michigan, all of which would help support Ford's line of EVs, such as the F-150 Lightning and Mustang Mach-E. With the Focus gone, Ford is left without a traditional car in their lineup. However, since EVs are cheaper to drive than ICE cars, the loss of the iconic Focus may open up an avenue for exciting new cars from Ford. If the Detroit automaker builds more EVs at an affordable price, the future looks bright. 
Ford's EV ambitions aren't the only reason it stopped manufacturing the Focus. In an interview with Car magazine, CEO Jim Farley stated, ""We'd always competed at the heart of the passenger-car market, which didn't work out too well for Mondeo, Focus and Fiesta. They were loved by a lot of customers but they could never justify more capital allocation – unlike commercial vehicles."" In the United States, Focus sales exceeded 200,000 every year between 2000 and 2004, and after a dip, reached this volume again in 2012. 
However, sales started dropping steadily from here to about 158,000 in 2017. The next year, Ford discontinued the Focus in the American market. Canadian sells were similarly bleak, with less than 12,000 units sold in 2017 before being discontinued. For those in the market for a Ford, you may want to check out the EV lineup. Like the F-150 Lightning, a pickup that costs less than a Tesla Cybertruck, and carries with it the iconic lines of Ford's long-running truck. "
75,2025-12-02,"This spring, my sister and I traded snowy Wisconsin for sunny San Juan, Puerto Rico.
From lounging at the beach to visiting historic sites, we were surprised by how much we were able to do on a tight budget.
If you're planning a trip to San Juan, here are my top recommendations for fun that won't break the bank.
My sister and I stayed within walking distance of Condado Beach, so visiting was a daily activity on our itinerary. We enjoyed watching everyone swim, tan, and hang out in the sun.
The beach is also close to lots of shops and restaurants, which I liked stopping at during the day.
I also highly recommend trying a treat from The Crazy Pineapple, a vendor on the beach. I paid $20 for an amazing mix of sorbet and rum inside a pineapple.
Old San Juan is a charming section of the city that dates back to the 16th century, complete with cobblestone streets and plenty of colorful buildings.
We loved looking at the architecture and stopping into different clothing, jewelry, and souvenir shops. During our visit, art vendors even lined Paseo de La Princesa, a picturesque promenade through the area.
One of our favorite restaurants in Old San Juan was Barrachina, which claims to be the birthplace of the piña colada. We each paid about $12 for our drinks, which were delicious and creamy. I thought it tasted better than any other piña colada I've had.
My sister and I had so much fun in Old San Juan that we came back multiple times throughout our trip.
Old San Juan is also home to historic forts like Castillo San Felipe del Morro and Castillo de San Cristóbal.
For just $10, I gained access to both sites, but due to time constraints, I was only able to visit San Cristóbal. As someone who appreciates learning about history, I loved exploring the tunnels and looking at the weaponry, wall drawings, and barracks.
I also recommend stopping by La Puerta de San Juan (the San Juan Gate), a bright red gate that was once the entrance to Old San Juan. There's no entrance fee, and it's located right by the water. It provided a glimpse into history and was a good spot to take photos.
Not only is Old San Juan an incredible place to sightsee during the day, but it's an amazing place for nightlife, too.
My sister and I splurged and spent $60 each to participate in the Old San Juan Bar Crawl.
Our group had about 30 people, and we were taken to several different bars, each of which provided a welcome drink. We also got access to an open bar for around 45 minutes at one of the locations.
La Placita de Santurce is a market square that transforms into a party when night falls. When we visited, music was blaring, the streets were filled with people dancing, and there was a line to get into most of the bars, restaurants, and clubs.
We enjoyed the music and the people at Aguardiente Bar and Tulum La Placita. When we visited, neither spot charged a cover fee, and each of our drinks cost about $15.
We also had a great time at Jungle Bird, a cocktail bar that, in my opinion, had a quieter vibe than some of the other places we'd been to.
On our last full day of the trip, my sister and I decided to take an Uber to Luquillo Beach, which is about an hour away from San Juan. It cost roughly $71 to get there and back.
At the beach, we enjoyed cooler water with fewer waves and the nearby Luquillo Kiosks, a street filled with food, drink, and souvenir stands. My sister and I tried tacos from one of the vendors and were impressed by the flavors.
We noticed that beachgoers also had the option to sign up for activities like jet skiing or kayaking, but we opted to just set up a picnic on the beach instead. It was great soaking up the sunshine before heading home.
In my experience, San Juan provided the perfect mix of beaches, history, food, and nightlife without a giant price tag.
I'm still dreaming about the waves at Condado Beach and sipping on piña coladas, and my sister and I are already talking about returning.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Brittney Ball, a 36-year-old former Meta employee in Washington, D.C. It's been edited for length and clarity.
When I got hired at Meta in 2020, it was life-changing for me as a single mom. It represented safety and stability — a place to work hard at and retire from.
So, when I was let go in February in a round of layoffs aimed at ""low-performers,"" it felt like a punch in the gut.
Nine months later, my severance and savings have run dry, I'm struggling to find a tech job, and I feel that the low-performer ""label"" is part of the reason. I'm no longer the same happy-go-lucky person I used to be, applying for jobs with excitement.
But my layoff is not just this bad thing that happened. It actually changed me for the better.
Did you get laid off from Meta and would like to share your story? If so, please fill out the form here.
I was once a single mom in a homeless shelter. I taught myself how to code and broke into tech without a college degree. Getting hired as a documentation engineer at Meta meant everything, not only to me, but to my family. I made my parents proud. I was the success story.
I really loved my time at Meta and took a lot of pride in my work and the community I built. I served as the global lead for the Black@Pride ERG and assisted with its developer advocacy team for a brief period. I truly believed I'd stay forever.
We knew layoffs were coming, but we didn't know who would be affected. Maybe my head was in the clouds, but I really didn't think I would be.
I was shocked to be laid off, especially since it was part of a round of layoffs targeting low performers. I was always so proud of my work, and I just didn't think I fell in that category. It was devastating, and I had no idea what to do next.
I used to be naive and filled with excitement to work for a tech company, but since the layoff, I just see it as a resource to fund my life. It no longer feels like the secure space it once was.
I took about a month after the layoff to process everything and figure out what it meant for me. That's when I conceived the idea to create my own tech startup, TechniDox, an AI-powered documentation platform.
It really began as a way to distract myself and a space to pour my passion into, but it's gained some traction, and I'm continuing to build it in hopes that it will grow into something bigger.
I've been applying to jobs, mostly at smaller tech companies, but I haven't gotten any offers yet. I have the skills and passion, so I'm unsure what the problem is. The low-performer ""label"" could be the reason I'm still unemployed.
I know the layoff is not my fault, but it's been devastating not to be able to turn it around in a way that helps me provide for my family as a mom.
Unemployment services have not kicked in, so I've been in a gray area where my parents and partner have been helping me pay bills and for groceries. I've always been the independent type who doesn't ask for help, so it was initially uncomfortable, but I've learned that I can't always do it alone.
My best friend has dropped everything to be with me when I needed it, and my partner supports me by reminding me to get some sunlight and stay active. I have a team of people who want to see me succeed and are helping me to achieve it, and I'm so grateful for them.
My LinkedIn network has also been super supportive. I've been posting about my layoff, and people have reached out to offer résumé reviews, send me referrals, or simply tag me in a post with kind words. I had no idea that I had such supportive people watching me on my journey. That has been truly heartwarming.
I was so focused on Meta while working there that I didn't upskill as much as I should have. I'm focusing on learning new things and putting myself out there.
I'm reviving an old YouTube channel and posting about my company on LinkedIn as I build it. I never attended college, so I recently enrolled at Trinity University and am working toward a dual degree in journalism and computer science. During this challenging time, I've been finding joy in learning about things that excite me.
Even though I haven't landed a job, I remind myself that this is also happening to so many other people. The job market is hard, but I'm not giving up.

Two ""code red"" alerts — the first from a veteran tech giant worried about a buzzy AI upstart, the second from the AI upstart after the tech giant gained ground.
What a difference three years can make.
News of a recent Sam Altman memo to OpenAI employees, first reported by The Information, is reverberating around the tech world and highlighting the competitive heat it's facing as Google narrows the gap in the AI race.
On Monday, Altman reportedly told OpenAI employees in an internal Slack memo that he was issuing a ""code red"" and that the company would be putting more resources into ChatGPT and delaying other products as a result.
Altman's memo illustrates just how much the AI race has changed. In 2022, Google's management issued its own ""code red"" in the wake of ChatGPT's launch, a moment that illustrated in sharp relief just how far behind the search giant was in the AI race despite financing the breakthrough research that paved the way for AI's development.
Three years later, it's clear that OpenAI's throne is under threat. Here are some of the pressure points it's facing as Google nips at its heels.
The elephant in the OpenAI room is Google's Gemini 3 AI model, which debuted to widespread praise.
The model's capabilities demonstrated that Google is no longer far behind in the AI race. It's not just OpenAI that's unnerved, either. Nvidia, the world's most valuable company by market cap, recently found itself defending its AI chips after a report about Google's own chip progress.
The search giant said in November that Gemini had more than 650 million monthly active users, a large increase from the 450 million such users it reported in July. In comparison, OpenAI has said nearly 800 million weekly active users.
Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently said that he was ditching ChatGPT in favor of Gemini 3 because of Gemini's ""insane"" improvement.
""Holy shit,"" Benioff wrote on X last month. ""I've used ChatGPT every day for 3 years. Just spent 2 hours on Gemini 3. I'm not going back. The leap is insane — reasoning, speed, images, video… everything is sharper and faster. It feels like the world just changed, again.""
Last month, Google launched ""Nano Banana Pro,"" its AI image generator, showcasing hyper-realistic images that users quickly used to imagine tech CEOs hanging out together or pretend famous Thanksgiving dinner table guests.
Altman's ""code red,"" according to The Information's report, specifically mentions Gemini 3 and teases a coming OpenAI model that it says tested ""ahead"" of Google's flagship model, as well as mentions prioritizing OpenAI's Imagegen image generation model for ChatGPT users.
The AI game is an expensive one, and Google has the advantage of being a cash-generating advertising juggernaut.
Sure, Google plans to spend between $91 billion and $93 billion this year on cap ex, much of which is going toward AI costs. But it also brought in $100 billion in revenue in just the last quarter alone — $74.18 billion of which came from its advertising business.
And unlike OpenAI, Google can leverage its massive size for a full-stack advantage, allowing it to control AI development from research to chip manufacturing to its in-house cloud, which hosts everything.
Meanwhile, some on Wall Street have raised concerns about OpenAI's mounting AI spending commitments, which tally at least $1.4 trillion over the next eight years. In response, Altman has said OpenAI is on track to bring in $20 billion in revenue this year, and expects its annualized revenue to grow to hundreds of billions in the coming years.
But OpenAI is still figuring out its own ads business — the launch of which could be delayed by Altman's ""code red,"" according to The Information.
OpenAI hasn't squandered its head start, and it's landed some major wins this year.
In recent months, OpenAI has made significant plays into other industries, including social media with Sora, its TikTok-esque AI video generation app. In a direct shot at Google Chrome, OpenAI also launched Atlas, its own web browser.
And it sounds like OpenAI has more up its sleeve as it battles the bottleneck of lining up enough compute and energy to power its developments.
OpenAI executives have said compute constraints are holding back other initiatives, like making ChatGPT Pulse, a personalized update feature within the chatbot for Pro users, available to everyone. Last week, Bill Peebles, OpenAI's head of Sora, announced that free users would face significant cuts in the number of videos they could generate per day.
ChatGPT also remains synonymous with AI — not unlike Google and online search. That will likely help continue to drive app downloads and usage and could also stave off Google's attempts to convince users to switch to Gemini or Google's other AI-infused products.
But humans are creatures of habit, and many already use a Google product or service everyday — a platform advantage that the tech giant is already utilizing to siphon away ChatGPT users.
Silicon Valley's history is built on startup disrupting the status quo.
Now, with OpenAI (smartly) looking over its shoulder, we get to watch the AI race heat up as Google, a former startup, gets its AI legs and hits its stride.
For OpenAI, it's a reminder that tech giants can put up quite a fight when facing the prospect of being disrupted — and sometimes, can turn the tables.
""I try not to think about competitors too much,"" Altman said last May before critiquing Google's aesthetic.
It sounds like those days are gone.

Quick, pretend you're a mall Santa: if a kid asks you for ""elves"" this year, what would you reply? Some kids will ask for easy gifts, like the child who requested pickles for Christmas. Easy! But what do you say to the 3-year-old who wants to find one of Santa's elves in her stocking? I imagine these mall Santas have some pretty good stock answers, and I bet they get really good at improvising their answers on the spot! 
As kids, my siblings and I knew that mall Santas weren't actual Santa, because he was at the North Pole making our presents, and because Santa couldn't be at both our town's malls at once, as we worked out. However, that never stopped us from being wide-eyed with wonder at the jolly guy with the white beard, who let us sit on his knee and tell him what we wanted for the holidays this year. 
Mall Santas have to do a lot of interpreting: when a toddler demands a snake and a goat for Christmas, they probably do mean the real animal, but we all know they're going to find stuffed animals under the tree instead. At least the whole process can help parents get some good ideas for what to gift the kiddos!

The stock price for American Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency mining firm associated with President Donald Trump’s sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., stumbled Tuesday, rapidly declining more than 50% at times in the morning as the price of bitcoin recovers following a recent drop.
The price for ABTC dropped 34% as of 2:50 p.m. EST, recovering slightly after falling as much as 51% in the hour after markets opened.
Eric Trump is American Bitcoin’s co-founder and chief strategy officer, while Donald Trump Jr. is listed on the company’s website as an investor.
In a post on social media, Eric Trump blamed stock price fluctuations on the company’s “pre-merger private placement shares” unlocking today, which he said allowed early investors to cash in.
Eric Trump said he’s committed to holding all of his shares in the company, insisting the company’s bitcoin mining business is strong and its “fundamentals are virtually unmatched,” referring to “mining BTC at ~50% of spot with 56% gross margin in Q3.”
The company debuted on the Nasdaq in September and stock prices surged after a merger with another bitcoin mining company, but share prices have since declined about 78% since their September high.
American Bitcoin says it holds over 3,000 bitcoin obtained through “Bitcoin mining and strategic at-market purchases,” according to its third quarter earnings report, with $64.2 million in revenue and $3.5 million in net income during the quarter.
The price of bitcoin fell Monday, declining about 6%, but has since recovered to over $92,000 after a Tuesday rally.
Bitcoin reached a record high in October, when prices topped $126,000. However, the price began falling after the Federal Reserve indicated further interest rate cuts were not guaranteed in December—as cryptocurrency prices tend to coincide with lower interest rates. Bitcoin’s price has since fallen more than 30% since its Oct. 6 peak, reaching a low of $85,468 on Monday before recovering slightly."

84,2025-12-02,"Cooler temperatures have arrived, but my favorite part of the fall-to-winter transition is the style: cozy knits, chic boots, and layers that make every outfit feel effortlessly elevated. But of course, no wardrobe is complete without a good pair of jeans.
Wide-leg silhouettes continue to trend, but I have yet to find a pair that hits all the marks: a flattering fit, high-quality fabric, and a classic yet versatile wash.
So, I turned to Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy (all under the Gap Inc. umbrella) to search for the perfect pair. Here's how it went.
As someone on a budget, I appreciate that Old Navy offers a wide range of affordable pieces that don't sacrifice on style.
The first thing I noticed upon walking into the store was the expansive denim display near the front entrance. Jeans were neatly folded on well-organized shelves and separated by silhouette, making it easy to find what I was looking for.
I grabbed a pair of wide-leg, high-rise jeans in a medium wash that seemed fitting for the darker tones of the season.
These jeans were long on me and would need to be hemmed, but I loved the overall fit and shape of the denim. I also appreciated the dynamic look of the wash, as it was slightly faded on the thighs and darker along the hems.
However, it seemed as though the material around the zipper didn't overlap properly, which made it appear as though the fly was down.
The material (63% cotton, 30% recycled polyester, 6% recycled cotton, and 1% spandex) felt soft and comfortable on my body, but didn't seem to be of the highest quality.
Although I prefer denim made with a higher percentage of cotton, I'd consider this option based on the low price. The jeans were originally marked at $37, but they were on sale for $28 during my visit, which I thought was an incredible deal for a stylish pair of pants.
This style was a high contender, but I decided to try my luck at the other retailers before making a decision.
I love Banana Republic's elevated aesthetic, so I was excited to explore the brand's denim collection.
When I walked in, I noticed the jeans were neatly folded on shelves, and the store felt chic and luxurious. However, the styles were scattered throughout the store, and the labels were small, making it a little more difficult to find what I was looking for.
Once I spotted the wide-leg silhouettes, I grabbed a pair of similar high-rise, wide-leg jeans with a slightly lighter wash. The store didn't have my exact size in stock, so I sized up.
It's also worth noting that despite my best efforts, I couldn't find the exact pair I tried on on the Banana Republic website after my visit.
My first impression upon trying these jeans on was that I loved the overall style.
They featured a medium wash that was slightly distressed throughout, creating an effortlessly cool look, especially when paired with the slouchy silhouette.
The shape of the pants was also flattering on my backside and legs, which is always a plus.
When I looked at the tag, I noticed this pair was made of 74% cotton, 25% lyocell, and 1% spandex/elastane. With the highest percentage of cotton of the pairs I tried on, they were comfortable and breathable while still holding their structure and shape.
At $120, the Banana Republic jeans cost significantly more than those of the other retailers I visited. But in my opinion, a good pair of jeans is always a worthwhile investment. With the proper sizing, this pair is something I'd wear regularly for a long time.
Lately, I've shopped at Gap for everything from a stylish fall sweater to work-friendly pants. So, I was hopeful I'd be able to find a nice pair of jeans there.
When I walked into my local store, I found a sizable section of denim on shelves with large labels. However, I could only find one wide-leg style — the mid-rise baggy jeans, which have an extra-wide and slouchy silhouette.
This pair of jeans was oversized in the legs and length, and if it were available in-store, I would've tried on a size down. However, I did appreciate the light wash, which was classic and still had some dimension.
Overall, these were comfortable and breathable, with fabric made from 55% cotton, 40% lyocell, and 5% recycled cotton.
However, I thought the style was unflattering and overwhelmed my body type. Based on the fit, wash, comfort, and style, these were my least favorite pair of jeans out of the three options, especially considering the $90 price tag.
At the end of the day, I thought all three options I tried on were decent.
The price for the Old Navy pair was hard to beat, but overall, my favorite jeans were from Banana Republic.

Today, in the Calculated Risk Real Estate Newsletter: Final Look at Housing Markets in October and a Look Ahead to November Sales
A brief excerpt: After the National Association of Realtors® (NAR) releases the monthly existing home sales report, I pick up additional local market data that is reported after the NAR.  This is the final look at local markets in October.

There were several key stories for October:

• Sales NSA are essentially unchanged YoY through October, and sales last year were the lowest since 1995! And the YoY comparisons for November and December will be more difficult.

• Sales SAAR (seasonally adjusted annual rate) have bounced around 4 million for the last 3 years.

• Months-of-supply is above pre-pandemic levels.

• The median price is up 2.1% YoY, and with the increases in inventory, some regional areas will see further price declines - and we might see national price declines later this year (or in 2026).

Sales at 4.10 million on a Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate (SAAR) basis were at the consensus estimate.

Sales averaged close to 5.38 million SAAR for the month of October in the 2017-2019 period. So, sales are about 24% below pre-pandemic levels.
...
In October, sales in these markets were up 2.4% YoY. Last month, in September, these same markets were up 7.7% year-over-year Not Seasonally Adjusted (NSA).  The NAR reported sales were up 2.9% YoY NSA, so this sample is close.

Important: There were the same number of working days in October 2025 (22) as in October 2024 (22). So, the year-over-year change in the headline SA data was similar to the change in NSA data (there are other seasonal factors).
...
 More local data coming in December for activity in November! There is much more in the article.

87,2025-12-02,"Apple is facing hundreds of millions of euros in damages claims over its allegedly “excessive” App Store fees. Here are the details.
As reported by Reuters, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decided today that Apple can be sued over damage claims brought by two Dutch foundations representing iPhone and iPad users.
From the report:
The foundations argue that the fees charged by Apple for third-party apps on the App Store are excessive, hurt users and are consistent with an unlawful abuse of a dominant position. App developers using Apple’s in-app payment system are charged commissions of up to 30%.
Apple has said that a Dutch court does not have jurisdiction as the alleged harmful event did not occur in the Netherlands.
Despite Apple’s argument, the CJEU reportedly decided that since “the App Store in question is designed specifically for the Dutch market and uses Dutch to offer apps for sale to users who have an Apple ID associated with the Netherlands, regardless of where they are based,” the antitrust case can move forward.
A lawyer representing one of the two claims argues that the alleged harm totals about 637 million euros:
On the basis of the available information, in the writ of summons the damage suffered by seven million affected iPhone users and seven million affected iPad users, was estimated at around 637 million euros (including statutory interest)
The case is likely to go to a merits hearing in the first quarter of 2026, and you can read more about today’s decision here.

This weekly guide sorts the very best from the rest when it comes to the saturated world of sneaker releases, with information on prices and where to buy. Please note — some sneakers may sell out at speed.
Raffles, friends and family, and player exclusives — all of that before a mere mention of the many fire general sneaker releases out there. The world of sneaker drops can be a tricky place to navigate, but we’re here to help. Behold, the best of the best of what you can actually buy on the open market, right now.
This week’s selection is about as balanced as we’ve seen so far, featuring collaborations, classic sportswear brands, and some seriously futuristic sneakers.
The cream of the sneaker crop awaits you. What are you waiting for?
Release Date: March 14
Editor's Notes: Nigel Sylvester and Air Jordan have cornered the sneaker/BMX-head market with past collaborations and this new drop is no different. Detailed in a bold, fiery hue with burgundy accents, the Air Jordan 4 Retro OG “Brick By Brick” is one of the hardest Jordan collabs this year. 
Release Date: March 13
Editor's Notes: For a band steeped in secrecy, it’s surprising they’ve linked up with ASICS for a 2-piece drop of the GEL-Kayano 14. Both pairs feature ZUTOMAYO’s signature purple hue and bungee cords that wrap around the upper. 
Release Date: March 14
Editor's Notes: As far as OG sneaker blogs go, Footpatrol has certainly earned its stripes, in this case, Creek (the name of Saucony’s logo). The new collaboration updates the ProGrid Omni 9 in a spring-ready colorway with Footpatrol’s logo debossed on the tongue.  
Release Date: March 15
Editor's Notes: For some reason, Nike’s Air Jordan 9 hasn’t been retroed as often as other models through the years, but when it does drop it’s best to cop them asap. The Cool Grey colorway returns with its signature patent leather overlay and icy sole. 
Release Date: March 13
Editor's Notes: If you’ve been sleeping on Austrailia-based Song for the Mute, it’s time to start paying attention. 
Alongside new colorways of the Adistar Cushion, Song for the Mute links with adidas for a new collaboration featuring a trio of the brand’s most celebrated silhouette. 
Release Date: March 12
Editor's Notes:  It was only a matter of time until Crocs’ Classic Clog received the BAPE camo treatment. The new drop features three renditions detailed with allover camo and arrives with five exclusive Jibbitz to customize your pair.

90,2025-12-02,"If you are currently in the job market looking to get hired, just remember that an interview goes both ways. They are seeing if you are a good fit for the job, and YOU are also seeing if the job is a good fit for you. So when this person laughed so hard in a job interview that she left hoping to not get an offer, we actually applaud it. 
 
This person had been unemployed and searching for a job for two months already. When they were offered an interview from a company that has a 2.1 rating on Glassdoor, they knew it was most likely not going to be a good fit, but it's still good to practice your interview skills. Plus, who knows, maybe they would actually end up being chill! Spoiler alert: They did NOT end up being chill in the slightest. This entitled ""company"" had the audacity to offer a minimum wage job that demanded almost 80 hours out of your week. You also would have to pay $700 a month for your own health insurance ""benefit"" (Do you see any benefit there?), and do ""mandatory overtime"" every Saturday that did not give overtime payment… Like, girl, what?? The math ain't mathin'…
 
What would you do if a company was saying red flag after red flag during your job interview? Would you have also laughed out loud in their faces? We sure hope so.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Amina Green, a 29-year-old data scientist based in San Francisco. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. A Waymo spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.
I remember being excited for my first Waymo ride earlier last year.
When I was a child, I got into a really bad car accident, so I've always been afraid to drive myself around. It's a personal choice for me not to get my driver's license, so I walk most places in San Francisco or use ride-hailing.
I've known about autonomous-driving technology for a while. I've been living in SF for about five years. So it was exciting just to even step inside a Waymo for the first time.
The robotaxi felt safe. I appreciate the ease of use, the convenience, and the privacy.
Sometimes, after coming back from therapy, I call a Waymo because I can be in a sensitive state of mind, so I'd prefer to be alone.
It's also just fun. It feels so sci-fi. I even made a video of myself doing my makeup inside the robotaxi, and it got a lot of views on social media. There's the novelty of it to some extent. But it's also like having my own energy or vibe in the car; I can set the music to what I like, I can control the temperature — those sorts of things.
Then, in September 2024, I was involved in an incident inside a Waymo that left me a little scared and frustrated.
I was heading to an appointment to get my hair braided. I remember sitting in the front seat of the Waymo, filming randomly as I've gotten into the habit of recording myself inside the car.
Then, near the South of Market-Tenderloin area, these two guys stepped right in front of my ride after the Waymo stopped for a red light.
I don't know why they did that. They seemed like they were trying to be silly, but they kept badgering me for my number. I repeatedly told them to get out of the way, to stop, and that they were holding up traffic.
🚨Warning to women in SF 🚨I love Waymo but this was scary 😣2 men stopped in front of my car and demanded that I give my number.It left me stuck as the car was stalled in the street.Thankfully, it only lasted a few minutes...Ladies please be aware of this pic.twitter.com/6VEqb1WoJb
I was annoyed because I was already running late for my hair appointment. But I was also a bit afraid. I used to work for a nonprofit in this neighborhood, so I knew that if something happened, there wouldn't be police nearby or anyone to really help.
The most frustrating part was that after the guys left, my Waymo just sat there. It was a little scary, but also kind of annoying. Other drivers on the road were getting upset, and I felt like a sitting duck. If it had happened at night, it would've been a lot scarier.
I don't remember if I called Waymo's remote assistance or if they contacted me, but the support team determined that something had happened during my ride. They asked if I was OK; I said yes and talked a bit. Throughout the day, they called me two more times to make sure I was OK.
I ended up getting $100 in credit and participated in a user research experience with the Waymo team. It was interesting to see the features they're working on.
After the incident, I stopped taking Waymo for maybe about two or three months.
After a while, I started taking Waymo again because I still feel safer riding in a Waymo than in a human-driven vehicle.
I've been using ride-hailing services for nearly 10 years. I've had mostly positive experiences using them, but I've also had a few weird incidents.
There are situations where I wouldn't have wanted to be alone in a car with a stranger at night.
Sometimes, the ride is just straight-up dangerous. I recall a driver who was distracted by his phone, watching YouTube videos while driving.
I usually report these incidents, but I'm not sure how the companies handled the situation.
I feel safer knowing that Waymo has personnel on standby in case something happens to its cars.
That's not to say Waymo is perfect.
Beyond getting the engineering right, I think there are social and cultural factors the company should consider if it wants the technology to be widely adopted.
For example, people interact with the streets differently in different neighborhoods. I think about the Tenderloin, where it's common for people to run into the middle of the street. Is Waymo thinking about the kinds of environments its cars go through?
Maybe Waymo could give users different route options that could avoid certain neighborhoods. It may not be politically correct to say, but I think this is just the basic reality of the world we live in: There are certain neighborhoods where women, or any person, might be more likely targeted if you're by yourself.
It would also be nice if there were an extra security feature, such as automatically locking the door once the rider steps into the car.
Then, there are a lot of people in the city who aren't in tech. To them, Waymo is a symbol of this larger cultural change in the region that they feel like they're being left out of.
So, while I don't agree with it, I almost understand why some people would vandalize the cars.
I'm also just a practical rider. I still use human ride-hailing services — I'd say it's about 50-50 — because Waymo's wait time can be a bit long. Or sometimes Waymo's just way more expensive.
Ultimately, I'm positive about the technology. I hope this will be widely available, but there are some considerations and edge cases that may need to be addressed before mass adoption.

96,2025-12-02,"India has ordered all new smartphones to come pre-loaded with a state-run cybersecurity app, sparking privacy and surveillance concerns.
Under the order - passed last week but made public on Monday - smartphone makers have 90 days to ensure all new devices come with the government's Sanchar Saathi app, whose ""functionalities cannot be disabled or restricted"". 
It says this is necessary to help citizens verify the authenticity of a handset and report the suspected misuse of telecom resources. 
The move - which comes in one of the world's largest phone markets, with more than 1.2 billion mobile users - has been criticised by cyber experts, who say it breaches citizens' right to privacy.
Under the app's privacy policy, it can make and manage phone calls, send messages, access call and message logs, photos and files as well as the phone's camera.
""In plain terms, this converts every smartphone sold in India into a vessel for state mandated software that the user cannot meaningfully refuse, control, or remove,"" advocacy group Internet Freedom Foundation said in a statement.
Amid the growing criticism, India's Minister of Communications Jyotiradtiya Scindia has clarified that mobile phone users will have the option to delete this app if they don't want to use it.
""This is a completely voluntary and democratic system - users may choose to activate the app and avail its benefits, or if they do not wish to, they can easily delete it from their phone at any time,"" he wrote on X. 
The minister did not, however, clarify how this would be done if the app's functions cannot be disabled or restricted. 
Launched in January, the Sanchar Saathi app allows users to check a device's IMEI, report lost or stolen phones and flag suspected fraud communications.  
An IMEI - the International Mobile Equipment Identity - is a unique 15-digit code that identifies and authenticates a mobile device on cellular networks. The code is  essentially the phone's serial number.
In a statement, India's Department of Telecommunications said that mobile handsets with duplicate or spoofed IMEI numbers pose ""serious endangerment"" to telecom cyber security.
""India has big second-hand mobile device market. Cases have also been observed where stolen or blacklisted devices are being re-sold,"" it said, adding that this makes the purchaser an ""abetter in crime and causes financial loss to them"".
Under the new rules,  the pre-installed app must be ""readily visible and accessible"" to users when they set up a device and its functionalities cannot be disabled or restricted. 
Smartphone makers must also ""make an endeavour"" to provide the app through software updates for devices that are out of factories but haven't been sold yet, the statement said. 
All companies have been asked to give compliance reports on the order in 120 days.
The government says the move will bolster telecom cybersecurity. A Reuters report, citing official figures, says the app has helped recover more than 700,000 lost phones - including 50,000 in October alone.
But experts say the app's broad permissions raise concerns about how much data it can collect, widening the scope for surveillance.
Technology analyst Prasanto K Roy says the bigger concern is about how much access an app might eventually be allowed on the handset.
""We can't see exactly what it's doing, but we can see that it's asking for a great deal of permissions - potential access to just about everything from flashlight to camera. This is itself worrying,"" he told the BBC. 
On Google's Play Store, the app says it doesn't collect or share any user data. The BBC has reached out to the department of telecommunications with questions about the app and the privacy concerns related to it.  
Mr Roy adds that compliance will be difficult, since the order runs counter to the policies of most handset-makers, including Apple.
“Most companies prohibit installation of any government or third-party app before the sale of a smartphone,"" he says, ""barring in China and Russia”.
While India's smartphone market is dominated by Android, Apple's iOS powered an estimated 4.5% of the 735 million smartphones in the country by mid-2025, according to Counterpoint Research. 
Apple has not commented publicly, but Reuters reports it does not intend to comply and ""will convey its concerns to Delhi"".
India is not the only country to have tightened rules on device verification.
In August, Russia ordered all phones and tablets sold in the country to come pre-installed with the state-backed MAX messenger app, sparking similar privacy and surveillance concerns.

97,2025-12-02,"Get the 65-inch C4 for $1,149 at Walmart

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Well, here's something I thought I wouldn't see on Cyber Monday: a deal on the LG C4! The 65-inch C4 is available for $1,149 (was $1,999) at Walmart. This is actually the cheapest the 65-inch model has ever been!
• Shop Walmart's full Cyber Monday sale
The LG C4 is one of LG's top OLEDs in the last few years, delivering a new level of brightness for a mid-range OLED TV when released in 2024, while also delivering the features and performance we'd come to expect from LG's C-series models. I didn't expect to see the 65-inch C4 in the Cyber Monday deals, especially now at its lowest ever price.
(Not in the US? See today's best deals in your region below)
One of 2024's best TVs, the LG C4 does it all, with brilliant picture quality, premium gaming features and performance, and an ultra-competitive price. This deal knocks a massive 43% off the 65-inch model at Walmart, taking this fantastic OLED TV down to its lowest ever price. 
The LG C4 was one of the best TVs of 2024, topping every single one of our best-of lists well into 2025. It's since been replaced there by the LG C5, and that was only because the C4's stock ran low. By the looks of it, Walmart has found some stock!
The C4 earned 4.5 stars in our review. We were impressed by its picture quality, with new levels of brightness for an OLED in this price range, hitting 1,000 nits. It also demonstrates excellent detail and contrast, vivid colors and bright highlights.
The C4 is one of the best gaming TVs you'll find. It has four HDMI 2.1 ports that support 4K 144Hz, FreeSync and G-Sync, Dolby Vision gaming, HGiG and ALLM. A 9.2ms input lag time means performance is ultra-smooth and responsive, whatever game you play.
The C4 really is a jack of all trades TV, and this is likely to be your last chance to get it, especially at this price. If you want the ultimate all-rounder OLED TV, this is it.
Best Buy's Cyber Monday sale has brought LG's 48-inch B5 OLED TV back to an excellently low price – it was actually $20 cheaper over Black Friday, but this is the lowest it's every been otherwise, and is an excellent value. Released this year, the LG B5 is the best budget OLED TV on the market. The 48-inch display delivers an exceptional picture with brilliant colors and sharp contrast. You also get excellent gaming features, thanks to the four HDMI 2.1 ports and new AI tools, including AI Search, AI Concierge, and an improved AI Chatbot.
The TCL QM6K is an fantastic budget mini-LED TV, bringing premium features at a shockingly low price, but it really as as much of a bargain as it looks. It delivers great brightness and good local dimming for rich image quality, and has solid gaming features and performance for the price range, including 4K 144Hz and VRR support. This is a record-low for this size, and it's our pick as the best of the budget mini-LEDs.
This Cyber Monday deal knocks $1,000 off the 77-inch Sony Bravia 8 OLED TV, taking it back to its record-low price. The Bravia 8 is a great TV, with a contrast-rich, colorful picture, good gaming features (especially for PS5), and even better built-in sound than its OLED rivals. This is a great deal if you're looking for a massive OLED display.

98,2025-12-02,"While Black Friday and Cyber Monday are largely behind us now, Walmart has officially extended its sale for another day and this has prompted Amazon to retain the wild deal pricing on AirPods 4 with ANC – you can still score them down at $99 (45% off). On top of that, we are tracking some hangover Cyber Monday pricing on M5 MacBook Pro configurations and M4 MacBook Air, as well as Mac mini at $479. Just be sure to dive into the ongoing Nomad Black Friday event and its latest flash sale on the Titanium Apple Watch Ultra 3/Series Band at 25% off. All of that and more awaits below. 
While much of the best Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals are long gone now, some of the best are actually still live as of this morning – the wild 45% price drop on AirPods 4 with ANC at $99 are a prime example here.
The AirPods Pro 3 and base model set of AirPods 4 have now either sold out completely or jumped back up in price. But Amazon is still offering Apple’s AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation down at $99 shipped (as of the time of writing). This is a regularly $179 set of current-generation Apple buds at 45% off.
While, like most hangover Cyber Monday deals, this deal could die at any second, and that might very well be the case, this one actually has a shot of making it through the day.
Walmart has officially extended its Cyber Monday sale for what appears to be one more day (through December 2). This somewhat surprising move has many of the national retailer’s biggest and best deals (at least those still in stock) up for grabs for another day – the AirPods 4 with ANC is one of those offers, and a particularly good one at that. This might very well prompt Amazon to leave the $99 Black Friday/Cyber Monday deal live for another day as well.
There were more than a few particularly remarkable deals tracked for Black Friday this year – up to $400 off the latest Google Pixel 10 lineup, gigantic savings on the latest Samsung foldables, the best prices ever on the new M5 MacBook Pro, iPad mini 7, and AirPods Pro 3 – but landing a set of AirPods 4 with ANC at $99 is very much one of them. 
Up until the Black Friday deals starting going live this year, AirPods 4 with ANC had never dropped below $119 at Amazon, and even those offers were rare Prime Day event prices we had only tracked a couple times since the series 4 Pods released in late 2024. Black Friday ushered in the very first chance to land a set at $100, and Cyber Monday dropped them an additional $1 to the same $99 price tag we are tracking this morning.
AirPods 4 with ANC are live right now at $99 – a serious steal of a deal on a wonderful set of Apple buds that might be gone for good by day’s end (or anytime now). 

The Black Friday and Cyber Monday Apple deals were largely focused on AirPods, if not for any other reason than the particularly notable all-time lows that headlined this year’s massive sale event. That said, there were some wonderful deals on the Mac side things, and the absolute most affordable current-generation machine is still down at the Black Friday/Cyber Monday pice – M4 Mac mini from $479 shipped.
Amazon is currently offering Apple’s most affordable M4 Mac mini configuration with the 16GB RAM/256GB storage setup at $479 shipped, which is $120 off the $599 list price. The 24GB/512GB M4 mini– the machine I am typing this article on right now – is also still sitting down at the$869 holiday pricing we have been tracking over the last week or so ($130 off).
Deals on Mac mini haven’t exactly been hard to come by, but seeing prices like we are right now are. The base model, if you ask me, is a wonderful value at the full $599 list price, a great buy at the $500 deal price we have featured a number of times now, and an absolute steal at $479 – the fact that one can even get full, complete access to an M4 chip running the latest macOS at a price like this is still kind of incredible to me.
Apple’s latest M4 MacBook Air lineup and the brand new M5 MacBook Pro saw some big-time price drops for Black Friday and Cyber Monday this year, and the deals are beginning to disappear. Some of the colorways on the M4 MacBook Air configurations at$250 off are completely out of stock at Amazon now, with much of the same on the $250 price drops on the M5 MacBook Pro – if you’re looking to land either of them at the Black Friday price you’ll want to it now while you still can.
Amazon and other retailers slashed a straight up $250 off the M4 MacBook Air lineup during Black Friday for the first time – we had tracked a number of opportunities at $200 off this year, but $250 off is another story and it could disappear entirely very soon:
Apple unleashed the new M5 MacBook Pro less than 2 months ago and, after some early, lighter deals closer to launch, most configurations out there went $250 off for Black Friday this year. Amazon has already gone out of stock on select colors and configs as of this morning so get in there while you can still land most of them at the all-time low pricing:
Alongside the ongoing and particularly amazing 45% price drop on AirPods 4 with ANC at $99, we are also still seeing some of the Apple Watch Series 11 Cyber Monday all-time lows live at Amazon. Configuration options are starting to jump back up in price as of this morning though, so you’ll want to get in there as soon as possible if you want to score the special holiday pricing.
We saw some $50 price drops ahead of Black Friday, and then some $60 price drops for Thanksgiving, but Cyber Monday delivered the best deals to date on Apple Watch Series 11 at $70 off the list price. Costco members were privy to slightly deeper price drop for a brief time yesterday evening, but that deal came and went very quickly. 
As of right now, there are still some configs sitting down at the Amazon all-time low prices and you can scope them out below:
Okay, here we go folks – the official Nomad 2025 Black Friday sale is now live! One of our absolute favorite Apple gear accessory brands is now offering deep price drops across just about everything it sells with only a few minor exceptions. There are no promo codes needed here, everything that’s on sale is automatically marked downby as much as 75% offand it’s now up for grabs – get in there quick, the best stuff can sell out quick.
Nomad doesn’t often deliver sitewide savings like this, save for a few holiday offers throughout the year and our exclusive deal events for 9to5 readers. But it is Black Friday and Nomad is once again getting off to an early start – this is the official sale though, not some false start early event. 
The official Nomad sale starts today and runs right through Cyber Monday until December 3 this year. Just keep mind, as mentioned above, Nomad gear can indeed sell out during events like this and it would not be surprising to see some of the big-ticket items and popular stocking stuffers like its Find My Tracking Cards sell right out well before Thanksgiving. 
Here’s a quick selection of some of the top deals we spotted already this year, but we will be featuring additional deals from the sale today and updating this post as well:
Another host of highlights here include its latest Tempo sport Apple Watch bands, its sweet little ChargeKey 240W keychain accessory, and the aforementioned leather Pixel Watch band:

Fans in Japan will hear Kojima's voice as a little mole.
By 
    Eddie Makuch
   on December 2, 2025 at 6:33AM PST
Writer-director Hideo Kojima has announced that he is part of the voice cast for the Japanese version of Disney's Zootopia 2. He voices the mole role of Paul Moldebrandt.
Kojima told Famitsu that Zootopia 2 director Jared Bush personally asked Kojima to play the role for the Japanese dubbing of the Disney film that's now in theaters and putting up massive numbers.
Zootopia 2 has already made $560 million+ globally, thanks in large part to China, where the film has earned $270 million so far. China is far and away the biggest market for Zootopia 2 so far, the next closet being the US and Canada ($158.8 million).
Zootopia opens in Japan this Friday, December 5, and you can get a glimpse of Kojima's voiceover performance in the brief clip below. In the US version of Zootopia 2, Disney mainstay Josh Gad (Frozen, Beauty and the Beast) voices Paul Moldebrandt.
Here is the Hideo Kojima cameo from Zootopia 2 Japanese Dub. https://t.co/VeO493bt5t pic.twitter.com/8gnE31Ch9V
Kojima and Disney are staying in business together, as the upcoming Death Stranding animated TV show is being made for Disney+.
Kojima's latest game, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, is nominated for seven total awards at The Game Awards, including Game of the Year.
