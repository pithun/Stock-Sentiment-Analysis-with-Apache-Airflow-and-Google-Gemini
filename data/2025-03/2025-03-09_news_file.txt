In what's now the third iteration of the Galaxy Tab S Ultra, Samsung made essentially no design changes. But it did make the Tab S10 Ultra (and S10 Plus) the first flagship Samsung tablet to be powered by a MediaTek chip. Thankfully, there are no noticeable performance drops, unless you plan on emulating PC or Switch games. Besides that, it's basically business as usual, with the exception of a few more Galaxy AI and Gemini features baked in. Normally, this wouldn't be a bad thing, but the Android tablet market is surprisingly beginning to heat up, potentially putting some pressure on Samsung for once.

Much like its flagship slab phones, Samsung has been enjoying a comfortable cushion in the world of Android tablets. However, that cushion might be starting to wear thin, leaving us to wonder whether the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is still the best that money can buy.
Samsung made a couple of surprising decisions with its flagship tablet lineup, of which only one really affects the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra. Dropping Qualcomm in favor of MediaTek was a bold choice, but besides that, it might look like there's not really much of a difference when compared to its predecessor. So let's dive in and see whether that's the case or if there's some kind of hidden magic.

The Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra was announced in September 2024 alongside the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus, S24 FE, and Galaxy Watch FE. It's available in three different configurations, starting with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, with a retail price of $1,199.99. The 12GB/512GB model comes in at $1,319.99, while the 16GB/1TB variant will set you back $1,619.99.

No matter what your feelings are when it comes to using Android tablets, sometimes it's best when a company recognizes that it doesn't need to make any drastic design changes. That's exactly what Samsung has done with the Tab S10 Ultra, as it seems like we just have updated internals packed inside of the same shell from the Tab S9 Ultra.
That means if you're upgrading from the previous version, you won't have to shell out a bunch of extra cash for new cases or accessories. This was something that drove me absolutely mad when Samsung went from the Tab S8 Ultra to the Tab S9 Ultra. Thankfully, it's not an issue this time around.
Externally, literally, everything remains the same, with the exception of the colors on the Tab S10 Ultra. The 14.6-inch AMOLED display is as beautiful as ever, making it perfect for getting work done, playing games, or propping it up to watch a movie.
Oh yeah, and the S Pen is still included in the box, which was to be expected but is still welcome.

The best part is that the possibilities of what you can do with the Tab S10 Ultra are practically endless. I've used it as an external monitor for both my desktop and gaming handheld, a smart home dashboard, a digital notebook, and more. In fact, I'm writing this on the Tab S10 Ultra using Samsung DeX, which is connected wirelessly to my 49-inch Samsung OLED ultrawide monitor.
It's a bit odd, sure, especially because the giant 14.6-inch display is currently doubling as a massive touchpad. That's because this kind of just happened on a whim, and the Ultra is connected to Samsung's Book Cover Keyboard Slim (the one without a built-in trackpad.) Of course, connecting a mouse would make more sense, but I kind of like how I can just reach up and have the world's biggest touchpad.

To quickly recap, the Tab S10 Ultra is basically the Tab S9 Ultra that gets one extra year of updates. Well, not exactly. In a move that still surprises me, Samsung went with the MediaTek Dimensity 9300 Plus instead of the Snapdragon 8 Elite or even the 8 Gen 3.
But to be quite honest, except for one very specific niche, you wouldn't know it. And that's a good thing because if that weren't the case, Samsung would have much bigger problems on its hands.
So why would Samsung move away from Qualcomm in favor of MediaTek? That's right, you guessed it — AI. The Galaxy Tab S10 Plus and S10 Ultra are being touted as the company's ""first tablets purpose-built for AI."" But before getting too ahead of ourselves here, let's see how the Dimensity 9300 Plus compares to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 from the Tab S9 Ultra:
Test
Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra
Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra
Geekbench 6 (single-core)
2021
2075
Geekbench 6 (multi-core)
6855
5505
Geekbench AI (Quantized score)
2859
1672
While single-core scores match up with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, the Dimensity 9300 Plus destroys its competitor in multi-core Geekbench AI. Which just so happened to be the two key areas of focus when Samsung introduced the Tab S10 Ultra.
However, I would go so far as to say that you wouldn't notice a difference if you were asked to use either of these in some sort of ""blind test."" On the one hand, that's great, as it would be a very different story if Samsung's flagship tablet ended up performing worse. On the other, you might've hoped to see more of a jump in the single-core performance.

Especially if you happen to see what the Snapdragon 8 Elite can do in the Galaxy S25 with its 3,025 single-core score and 9,640 multi-core score. Mind you, that's for a phone that costs $400 less than the base model Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra. Furthermore, the 8 Elite launched after the Tab S10, so it makes sense we didn't see it here.
Nevertheless, there's almost nothing to really complain about when it comes to performance. You'll still enjoy Samsung's suite of Galaxy AI features, paired quite nicely with Google Gemini. So, I can only hope that Samsung has left enough overhead for any other potential AI features that we'll see in the years to come.
Oh, and remember how I said that Samsung essentially kept the design the same as the Tab S9 Ultra? That also goes for the microSD card slot, which is a welcome inclusion on any device, let alone one that can serve as a gaming and media playback behemoth.

Giant monitors and trackpads aside, my Tab S10 Ultra usually resides in DeX mode. I don't really have much reason to ever go back to ""regular"" Android because it's all icky and annoying there. Well, at least for tablets of this size.
With Google finally working on a proper desktop mode for Pixel devices, it only further drives the point home that certain Samsung tablets should default to DeX mode out of the box. And if doesn't want to do it for every tablet, the Tab S Ultra should be the first.
The traditional Android experience still doesn't work well on tablets or even foldable phones. App scaling is weird; apps don't play nice when going beyond the confines of a narrow rectangle, and sometimes even the interface just looks odd. DeX solves most of those problems with a little help from One UI.

It makes total sense for Samsung to just embrace the idea of the Tab S Ultra providing a Microsoft Surface experience, powered by One UI and Android. However, this leads me to another issue that I was hoping it would solve but has yet to do so.
Samsung needs to ""borrow"" Apple's iPad Pro Magic Keyboard design.
I applaud the company for making it so you can use the Tab S9 Ultra cases with the newer model. Technically, there are two ""new"" keyboard cases that launched alongside the Tab S10 Ultra. But the only real difference is the addition of the Galaxy AI key next to the arrow keys.
Unfortunately, you have a tablet that can double as a laptop, but it's arguably one of the most uncomfortable ""laptops"" that you'll ever use. With the Book Cover Keyboard, everything works fine, but try using it with your Tab S10 Ultra on your lap, and you'll immediately want to pull out your hair.
The Book Cover Keyboard Slim is slightly better, as it's a bit more rigid than its counterpart. However, you miss out on the trackpad, which is fine in some instances but isn't the ideal experience for everyone.

Whenever I get a new Android device, whether it's a phone, tablet, or gaming handheld, the first thing I try to do is see how well it can handle emulation. Most modern devices can handle up to PS2 games fairly easily. The real test is seeing how well Switch emulation performs.
That's where my first annoyance about the move to MediaTek came to mind when I heard the rumors. Graphics drivers for MediaTek devices are... well... they just don't quite stack up to Qualcomm. They'll easily handle systems with mature emulators, but once you start getting into Switch and Windows emulation, it's an entirely different story.
I won't bore you with the details, but basically, Qualcomm devices allow for the use of custom driver support and Vulkan extensions. If you ever hear about ""Turnip"" drivers, these are custom-compiled drivers that are used in a variety of emulators, including Switch, 3DS, PS Vita, and others.
These drivers can offer improved compatibility along with increased performance, which sounds great! Until you learn that you won't be able to use these custom drivers with MediaTek's Mali drivers. This ultimately means that if you try to emulate one of your favorite Switch games only to see that it gets between 10-15fps, you're simply out of luck.

There's one more thing about the Tab S10 Ultra that continues to bug me. For whatever reason, Samsung's ""Ultra"" tablet isn't available with a cellular connection. This has bugged me for the last few iterations, but after learning that those in Europe can choose between having Wi-Fi or cellular, I was hopeful that the S10 Ultra might be a deviation from that pattern.
Sure, it's not a problem with the Galaxy S10 Plus, so if you really want mobile connectivity, that's still an option. But what about those of us who prefer the larger display? Especially considering that the S10 Ultra is essentially a super-sized and Android-powered Surface Pro.
I understand that it would only make this already-expensive device cost even more. But at the same time, I don't understand Samsung's rationale when it comes to limiting or holding features from its ""Ultra"" devices.

For the first time in a few years, I feel like there's some real competition in the higher-end Android tablet space. While nothing else can really match up in terms of the display, there are now options that can keep up with Samsung's flagship tablets.
The OnePlus Pad 2 is the first that comes to mind, simply because of how much of an improvement it is over the previous model. We have the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, a gorgeous 3K LCD panel (which is great for PWM), and Open Canvas offers a different take on multitasking. Plus, even if you decide to pick up the Stylo 2 and Smart Keyboard, it will still cost you less than the Tab S10 Ultra.
It's a similar story, at least on paper, with the Lenovo Yoga Tab Plus. This was announced at CES 2025 and has flown under the radar a bit, but maybe that will soon change. Lenovo, too, opted against going with the Snapdragon 8 Elite but instead relies on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. You'll also enjoy a 12.7-inch 3K display with a 144Hz refresh rate and 16GB of RAM. Lenovo includes both a stylus and a detachable keyboard in the box.
Last but certainly not least is the big elephant in the room, Apple's iPad Pro. It has everything you could want from a laptop replacement — a big and vibrant screen, an excellent keyboard, and you can even get cellular if you want. However, the biggest caveat is that it's running iPadOS, and while that might be great for some, I still wish Apple would give us macOS on this hardware.

You should buy this if...
You shouldn't buy this if...
Frankly, the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra isn't for everyone. That statement would be true even if we had the Snapdragon 8 Elite or 8 Gen 3 over the Dimensity 9300+. It's cumbersome to use as a traditional tablet, even though the 14.6-inch display is perfect for media consumption and playing games.
If you were to ask me for a recommendation, I'd probably tell you to just get the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus. With the extra money saved, you could spring for more storage or grab one with cellular connectivity. However, even that opens another can of worms when you look around at competing tablets with a similarly-sized screen.
That being said, there's a reason we chose this as the best tablet of 2024. There's nothing quite like having a device of this size powered by Android. If you do decide to pick up the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra, I highly recommend enabling DeX as soon as you get everything set up. It just makes more sense than being confined to the traditional Android UI.


Samsung packed the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra to the gills with as many features as it could, without changing the design just for the sake of it. But we're not entirely sure about how well this behemoth of a tablet will fare with MediaTek running the ship instead of Qualcomm.

President Donald Trump downplayed economic uncertainty over his tariffs, saying a ""period of transition"" is headed for the US economy as it adjusts. But he notably did not rule out a recession in the near future.

        Trump paused his 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada earlier this week, just after they went into effect. In an interview on the Fox News show ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" Trump said he paused his planned tariffs on Mexico and Canada to help American car manufacturers and ""to a certain extent,"" to help both countries. Trump paused the tariffs until April 2.
    

        ""I wanted to help the American car makers until April 2,"" Trump said on Fox. ""April 2, it becomes all reciprocal. What they charge us, we charge them.""
    

        After a strong start to the year, the stock market has seen significant volatility in recent weeks. This week, the market saw considerable uncertainty, with the S&P 500 down as much as 2% on Thursday following tariff concerns.
    

        Still, Trump downplayed fears over a possible recession in the Fox interview. When asked if he expected a recession in 2025, Trump responded: ""I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big. We're bringing wealth back to America.""
    

        ""It takes a little time,"" he added.
    

        Trump also avoided questions about providing clarity for publicly owned businesses about how his tariffs could disrupt the economy.
    

        ""They have plenty of clarity,"" he said. ""They just use that. That's like, almost a sound bite. They always say that, 'we want clarity,'"" Trump told Fox about business asking for economic clarity.
    

        Trump paused tariffs impacting US auto manufacturers on March 5 after Ford, Stellantis, and General Motors called the president requesting a reprieve. When pressed by Fox about what ""automakers are going to do for a month"" while the tariffs are paused, Trump said that this is a ""transition period.""
    

        ""I said, 'look, I'm going to do it this one time, but after that, I'm not doing it,'"" Trump told Fox. ""They called me and they wanted help during this little transition period, and I gave it to them.""
    

        Economists are still grappling with the impact of Trump's tariffs, which some economists say will increase inflation. Some analysts say that Trump's tariffs will not help increase manufacturing in the United States.
    

        ""Tariffs will not increase US manufacturing: technology, rather than trade, has been primarily responsible for the fifty-year decline in manufacturing jobs,"" John Veroneau, a former deputy US trade representative, wrote in a February 11 post on the Council on Foreign Relations website.

3,2025-03-09,"The Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has secured unprecedented access to at least seven sensitive federal databases, including those of the Internal Revenue Service and Social Security Administration. This access has sparked fears about cybersecurity vulnerabilities and privacy violations. Another concern has received far less attention: the potential use of the data to train a private companyâs artificial intelligence systems.
The White House press secretary said government data that DOGE has collected isnât being used to train Muskâs AI models, despite Elon Muskâs control over DOGE. However, evidence has emerged that DOGE personnel simultaneously hold positions with at least one of Muskâs companies.
At the Federal Aviation Administration, SpaceX employees have government email addresses. This dual employment creates a conduit for federal data to potentially be siphoned to Musk-owned enterprises, including xAI. The companyâs latest Grok AI chatbot model conspicuously refuses to give a clear denial about using such data.
As a political scientist and technologist who is intimately acquainted with public sources of government data, I believe this potential transmission of government data to private companies presents far greater privacy and power implications than most reporting identifies. A private entity with the capacity to develop artificial intelligence technologies could use government data to leapfrog its competitors and wield massive influence over society.
For AI developers, government databases represent something akin to finding the Holy Grail. While companies such as OpenAI, Google and xAI currently rely on information scraped from the public internet, nonpublic government repositories offer something much more valuable: verified records of actual human behavior across entire populations.
This isnât merely more data â itâs fundamentally different data. Social media posts and web browsing histories show curated or intended behaviors, but government databases capture real decisions and their consequences. For example, Medicare records reveal health care choices and outcomes. IRS and Treasury data reveal financial decisions and long-term impacts. And federal employment and education statistics reveal education paths and career trajectories.
What makes this data particularly valuable for AI training is its longitudinal nature and reliability. Unlike the disordered information available online, government records follow standardized protocols, undergo regular audits and must meet legal requirements for accuracy. Every Social Security payment, Medicare claim and federal grant creates a verified data point about real-world behavior. This data exists nowhere else with such breadth and authenticity in the U.S.
Most critically, government databases track entire populations over time, not just digitally active users. They include people who never use social media, donât shop online, or actively avoid digital services. For an AI company, this would mean training systems on the actual diversity of human experience rather than just the digital reflections people cast online.
Current AI systems face fundamental limitations that no amount of data scraped from the internet can overcome. When ChatGPT or Googleâs Gemini make mistakes, itâs often because theyâve been trained on information that might be popular but isnât necessarily true. They can tell you what people say about a policyâs effects, but they canât track those effects across populations and years.
Government data could change this equation. Imagine training an AI system not just on opinions about health care but on actual treatment outcomes across millions of patients. Consider the difference between learning from social media discussions about economic policies and analyzing their real impacts across different communities and demographics over decades.
A large, state-of-the-art, or frontier, model trained on comprehensive government data could understand the actual relationships between policies and outcomes. It could track unintended consequences across different population segments, model complex societal systems with real-world validation and predict the impacts of proposed changes based on historical evidence. For companies seeking to build next-generation AI systems, access to this data would create an almost insurmountable advantage.
A company like xAI could do far more with models trained on government data than building better chatbots or content generators. Such systems could fundamentally transform â and potentially control â how people understand and manage complex societal systems. While some of these capabilities could be beneficial under the control of accountable public agencies, I believe they pose a threat in the hands of a single private company.
Medicare and Medicaid databases contain records of treatments, outcomes and costs across diverse populations over decades. A frontier model trained on new government data could identify treatment patterns that succeed where others fail, and so dominate the health care industry. Such a model could understand how different interventions affect various populations over time, accounting for factors such as geographic location, socioeconomic status and concurrent conditions.
A company wielding the model could influence health care policy by demonstrating superior predictive capabilities and market population-level insights to pharmaceutical companies and insurers.
Treasury data represents perhaps the most valuable prize. Government financial databases contain granular details about how money flows through the economy. This includes real-time transaction data across federal payment systems, complete records of tax payments and refunds, detailed patterns of benefit distributions, and government contractor payments with performance metrics.
An AI company with access to this data could develop extraordinary capabilities for economic forecasting and market prediction. It could model the cascading effects of regulatory changes, predict economic vulnerabilities before they become crises, and optimize investment strategies with precision impossible through traditional methods.
Government databases contain information about critical infrastructure usage patterns, maintenance histories, emergency response times and development impacts. Every federal grant, infrastructure inspection and emergency response creates a data point that could help train AI to better understand how cities and regions function.
The power lies in the potential interconnectedness of this data. An AI system trained on government infrastructure records would understand how transportation patterns affect energy use, how housing policies affect emergency response times, and how infrastructure investments influence economic development across regions.
A private company with exclusive access would gain unique insight into the physical and economic arteries of American society. This could allow the company to develop âsmart cityâ systems that city governments would become dependent on, effectively privatizing aspects of urban governance. When combined with real-time data from private sources, the predictive capabilities would far exceed what any current system can achieve.
A company such as xAI, with Muskâs resources and preferential access through DOGE, could surmount technical and political obstacles far more easily than competitors. Recent advances in machine learning have also reduced the burdens of preparing data for the algorithms to process, making government data a veritable gold mine â one that rightfully belongs to the American people.
The threat of a private company accessing government data transcends individual privacy concerns. Even with personal identifiers removed, an AI system that analyzes patterns across millions of government records could enable surprising capabilities for making predictions and influencing behavior at the population level. The threat is AI systems that leverage government data to influence society, including electoral outcomes.
Since information is power, concentrating unprecedented data in the hands of a private entity with an explicit political agenda represents a profound challenge to the republic. I believe that the question is whether the American people can stand up to the potentially democracy-shattering corruption such a concentration would enable. If not, Americans should prepare to become digital subjects rather than human citizens.

Tariffs represent a significant but manageable challenge for investors. 
In today's interconnected global economy, shifts in trade policy can send ripples through financial markets with surprising speed. Among these policies, tariffs are particularly influential, capable of reshaping investment landscapes virtually overnight. The Trump administration's recent push for reciprocal tariffs has investors scrambling to understand potential impacts on their portfolios and long-term financial plans.
This article explores the relationship between tariffs and financial markets, examining how these trade measures affect different sectors, influence corporate earnings and ultimately impact your investment strategy. From manufacturing to technology, we'll analyze sector-specific vulnerabilities and provide actionable insights to help you navigate this challenging economic environment.
Tariffs are taxes governments impose on imported goods and services, designed to make foreign products more expensive than domestically produced alternatives. These customs duties serve multiple purposes: protecting domestic industries from foreign competition, raising government revenue, addressing trade imbalances and occasionally serving as diplomatic leverage. When a country imposes a tariff—a 25% duty on imported steel, for example—the importer must pay that percentage to the government before selling the product domestically.
The economic impact of tariffs extends far beyond simple taxation. They reshape supply chains, alter business competitive dynamics and influence international trade patterns. While proponents argue that tariffs help preserve domestic jobs and manufacturing capabilities, critics point to resulting price increases for consumers and businesses, potential retaliation from trading partners and inefficiencies created when companies make decisions based on tariff avoidance rather than economic fundamentals.
When governments announce new tariffs, stock markets typically respond with heightened volatility as investors recalibrate expectations about future corporate earnings. The most immediate reaction often comes from directly affected industries—companies that import tariffed goods as production inputs or export products to markets where retaliatory tariffs have been imposed. Sectors like semiconductors, automobiles and consumer electronics often experience immediate price movements as investors attempt to price in potential impacts.
Beyond these initial reactions, tariffs create second-order effects that ripple through the broader economy. Higher input costs for businesses can squeeze profit margins or force price increases that dampen consumer demand. Supply chain disruptions may cause inventory shortages or production delays. Furthermore, tariff-related uncertainty often leads companies to postpone capital investments, dragging economic growth.
The market's long-term response to tariffs depends largely on adaptability—how quickly companies can adjust supply chains, pass costs to consumers, or find alternative markets. Historical precedent suggests that while tariff announcements typically trigger immediate market declines, equities often recover once businesses navigate the new trade landscape.
The impact of tariffs varies dramatically across different sectors of the economy, with some industries facing existential challenges while others may discover unexpected opportunities. Understanding these sector-specific dynamics is crucial for investors looking to position their portfolios defensively or capitalize on emerging trends.
Manufacturing and industrial companies typically experience the most direct and immediate impact from tariff policies, particularly those dependent on global supply chains or export markets. Tariffs on steel and aluminum have significantly increased input costs for American manufacturers of everything from automobiles to appliances, creating margin pressure for companies unable to pass these costs to customers.
Companies with flexible supply chains have demonstrated greater resilience, redirecting procurement to domestic suppliers or non-tariffed countries. Conversely, manufacturers with specialized input requirements or capital-intensive production processes that cannot be easily relocated have suffered disproportionately. Companies with primarily domestic supply chains have generally outperformed their import-dependent counterparts during periods of trade tension.
The technology sector presents a particularly complex case, given its globally integrated supply chains and the strategic importance of technology in trade disputes. Tariffs affecting electronic components, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and finished consumer electronics have created significant challenges for hardware-focused technology companies. Companies like Apple have publicly acknowledged tariff-related margin pressures in their earnings reports.
Software and cloud computing companies have demonstrated excellent insulation from direct tariff effects, as their products face fewer trade barriers. However, even these firms aren't entirely immune—reduced IT hardware spending by corporate customers and potential regulatory retaliation in overseas markets present indirect risks. This differential impact creates both risks and opportunities within the broader technology sector.
Agriculture and commodities have emerged as strategic pawns in trade disputes, with agricultural products often targeted by retaliatory tariffs due to their political sensitivity. American farmers have been particularly affected by countermeasures from trading partners, which imposed tariffs on U.S. agricultural exports, including soybeans, corn and pork. U.S. soybean exports to China dropped significantly following tariff implementation, forcing producers to seek alternative markets or accept lower prices.
The effects extend beyond farmers to the entire agricultural supply chain, including seed suppliers, equipment manufacturers, and transportation companies. Agricultural equipment manufacturers have reported order cancellations and delayed purchases as farmers face uncertain export prospects. Meanwhile, agricultural processors with global footprints have demonstrated greater adaptability by redirecting supply chains and sourcing from non-tariffed regions.
Tariffs inevitably affect consumer prices, though the timing and magnitude of these effects vary considerably across product categories. A significant portion of tariff costs are typically passed through to consumers, with the remainder absorbed by importers, distributors and retailers. Recent tariffs have contributed to price increases in directly affected categories—consumer electronics, appliances and certain food items have seen price increases that exceed general inflation trends.
The inflationary impact of tariffs extends beyond directly taxed products to substitute goods. When imports become more expensive, domestic producers often raise their prices in response to reduced competitive pressure. This ""umbrella effect"" means tariffs can drive inflation even in product categories dominated by domestic production, potentially influencing Federal Reserve monetary policy decisions.
Consumer response to tariff-induced price increases varies by product category. Essential goods with few substitutes tend to see minimal demand reduction despite price increases, while discretionary purchases often experience more significant volume declines. Luxury goods manufacturers have generally maintained pricing power despite tariffs, while mass-market retailers operating on thin margins have reported compressed profitability as they attempt to maintain market share.
The effect of tariffs on corporate profitability varies tremendously across industries and individual companies. Companies directly importing tariffed components have reported immediate margin pressure, with many manufacturers citing increased input costs and reduced operating margins. The S&P 500 companies most exposed to global trade have seen greater earnings volatility during trade tension than domestically focused peers.
Beyond direct cost implications, tariffs create secondary effects that further influence profitability. Many companies report significant resources devoted to supply chain reorganization, tariff mitigation strategies, and regulatory compliance—expenses that rarely appear as line items but impact bottom-line results. These adaptation costs can significantly offset short-term savings achieved through supply chain modifications.
Market leaders with strong brands, proprietary technologies, or dominant market positions have demonstrated a remarkable ability to pass tariff costs to customers. This dynamic creates potential investment opportunities in companies with strong competitive moats, even within directly affected industries, as they may emerge from trade disputes with strengthened market positions relative to weaker competitors.
President Trump’s push for reciprocal tariffs, designed to match foreign trade barriers with equal U.S. tariffs, could have far-reaching effects on markets, prices and investments. While intended to strengthen American businesses, the policy risks higher costs, retaliatory measures and market volatility.
Industries reliant on global supply chains, such as automakers, semiconductors and consumer goods, may face rising costs, squeezing profit margins and weighing on stock prices. Meanwhile, domestic-focused industries like defense, utilities and U.S. manufacturing could see gains as reduced competition strengthens their market positions.
Tariffs often drive up the price of imports, impacting everything from electronics to raw materials, which can lead to inflation. Companies may absorb these costs by cutting expenses and hiring or passing them on to consumers, potentially reducing consumer spending and corporate earnings.
To navigate trade uncertainty, investors might consider defensive sectors like healthcare, utilities, consumer staples, U.S.-focused ETFs to limit foreign exposure, or commodities like gold and tangible assets as hedges against inflation.
While reciprocal tariffs could benefit select U.S. industries, they also pose risks of inflation, supply chain disruptions and slower growth. Investors should remain diversified and monitor sector trends to adjust their portfolios accordingly.
While tariffs introduce undeniable challenges for investors, thoughtful portfolio construction and strategic positioning can help mitigate risks while potentially capitalizing on emerging opportunities.
Companies generating the majority of their revenue domestically typically demonstrate greater resilience during trade disputes. These firms generally face reduced exposure to direct tariff costs, retaliatory measures and currency fluctuations. Sectors with naturally high domestic revenue concentration—such as utilities, regional banks, healthcare services and specific consumer discretionary businesses—have historically outperformed the broader market during periods of trade uncertainty.
Investors should look beyond austere headquarters locations to evaluate accurate domestic exposure, examining revenue sources, supply chain configurations and competitive dynamics. Financial filings typically disclose geographic revenue breakdowns, enabling investors to identify businesses with predominantly domestic operations.
While trade disputes between significant economies capture headlines, they also create potential opportunities in markets not directly involved in current tensions. Companies in these ""third-party"" countries may benefit as supply chains reconfigure to avoid tariffs. Following the implementation of U.S.-China tariffs, exports from Vietnam, Thailand and Mexico to both nations increased as companies redirected supply chains through alternative channels.
International diversification requires careful consideration of country-specific risks beyond tariff exposure. Political stability, regulatory environments, currency risks and market liquidity all influence investment outcomes in international markets. Investors might consider using actively managed funds with dedicated expertise in emerging and international markets.
The rapidly evolving nature of trade policy necessitates ongoing monitoring and portfolio adjustment. Rather than attempting to time these announcements, investors should establish systematic review processes that incorporate new trade developments into regular portfolio rebalancing. This approach allows thoughtful evaluation of potential impacts rather than reactive trading driven by headlines.
Reliable information sources include official government publications, industry-specific analyses from trade associations and research from established financial institutions. Major companies increasingly provide tariff impact disclosures in earnings reports and investor communications, offering valuable perspectives on real-world effects.
Bottom Line
Tariffs represent a significant but manageable challenge for investors. While trade policies can trigger substantial short-term volatility and create genuine business disruptions, historical evidence suggests that well-diversified portfolios with appropriate risk allocations can weather these storms. The most successful investors during trade disputes typically avoid panic-driven decisions, instead making measured adjustments based on fundamental analysis of tariff impacts on specific industries and companies. By focusing on businesses with sustainable competitive advantages, diversifying across geographies and sectors with varying tariff sensitivity and maintaining appropriate time horizons, investors can position their portfolios to endure current trade tensions while remaining poised to benefit from eventual resolutions.
Tariffs are primarily implemented to protect domestic industries from foreign competition, address trade imbalances, raise government revenue and occasionally serve as negotiating leverage in international trade discussions. They effectively increase the cost of imported goods to make domestic alternatives more price-competitive.
Investors should analyze industries based on their reliance on global supply chains, dependence on imported components subject to tariffs, exposure to export markets that might implement retaliatory measures, and ability to pass increased costs to consumers. Sectors like manufacturing, technology hardware and agriculture typically face greater direct exposure.
Tariffs are typically not permanent, though some may remain in place for extended periods. Trade policies evolve with changing administrations, economic conditions and international relations. Most significant tariffs are eventually reduced or eliminated through bilateral agreements, multilateral trade negotiations, or policy adjustments when their economic costs become apparent.
Yes, tariffs can create investment opportunities, particularly in domestic companies protected from foreign competition, businesses with manufacturing facilities in non-tariffed countries and firms with flexible supply chains able to adapt quickly. Additionally, periods of tariff-induced market volatility may present attractive entry points for long-term investors in quality companies temporarily affected by trade concerns."
8,2025-03-09,"There is a cheerful red awning and a newly painted cream wooden shopfront on the market square in Macclesfield. 
A new bakery cafe has just opened, offering ciabatta and sourdough loaves as well as hot cross buns, syrupy cakes, vegetable quiches and of course coffee. 
Like towns around the UK, Macclesfield has struggled with retailers closing, leaving empty stores, so there is a buzz around the new arrival. 
But Gail's, a brand that started in London more than 20 years ago, is controversial. It draws crowds and inspires social media memes, but attracts fierce criticism too.
A recent spate of national media coverage has even asked why some people ""hate"" Gail's so much, focusing on everything from who owns it to what it does with unsold pastries.
Its arrival isn't universally popular here either.
""We don't need another coffee shop,"" says Linda Willdig. She is out shopping with her friend Nicola Tomlinson, who agrees. ""There are too many,"" says Nicola.
In fact, from a table outside the new Gail's you could easily throw a cinnamon bun and hit both a Caffe Nero and a Costa. Greggs is just around the corner too.
So something different might have been better, says Jane Kent, a community nurse. 
""People will be larding out on all the bakery stuff,"" she says. ""We don't need more pastries.""
At heart, though, the objections to Gail's are not about what it sells, but that it doesn't really belong, that it will push up prices and put independent cafes out of business.
But Stephanie Lamb, a teacher on maternity leave, is more welcoming.
""I don't know Gail's, so it's not necessarily a chain to me,"" she says. ""I'm just happy to have something extra in town."" 
She likes a latte and a croissant and somewhere she can read a book for an hour.
At Gail's prices that would set her back £6.50. Yes, it's pricey, she says, but she is still planning to ""give it a whirl"".
Gail's - a name that suggests a traditional, single-owner, cafe - favours attractive old buildings, often ones vacated as bank branches close, especially if it is a corner site that means it's more visible to passers by. 
It has 170 outlets mostly clustered in London and the south east. But this year it plans to open around 40 more, including Ely, Cambridgeshire later this month, Bath in April, and Buxton, Derbyshire in May.
At Friday's opening in Macclesfield there was a flurry of interest in the new place on the square.
Even in the wake of the cost of living crisis, we are increasingly choosing a coffee out as a treat. Nearly two-thirds of people said they went to a coffee shop more than once a week, according to World Coffee Portal, spending more than £6 per visit on average.
So coffee shops are weathering the tough economic climate better than most businesses. There are now 11,450 branded chain outlets across the UK, up from 9,800 five years ago.
Speciality chains like Black Sheep Coffee, Coffee#1 and Blank Street are springing up in city centres, while the giants like Costa and Starbucks are opening drive-throughs and outlets in retail parks.
Caffe Nero has bought up several smaller chains, in different parts of the country, and is retaining their independent branding so it can make the most of local loyalties.
With enthusiasm for coffee so strong it's something of a mystery to Gail's chief executive Tom Molnar why people object to his chain. He feels misunderstood.
Mr Molnar - a joint owner with private equity backing - has been working on expanding the brand since he joined in 2003, but says it's not just about coffee. Its role as a neighbourhood bakery - baking fresh in-store and in regional bakery hubs every day - is key.
He's hoping to roll Gail's out to many more neighbourhoods, including less affluent ones.
""It's not supposed to be posh,"" he insists.
But for now they pick very carefully where to open, using an algorithm to help select the most promising postcodes.
It flags up things like whether there is a local butcher, bookshops, a park, schools, churches or a farmers' market.
""I prefer a place that's evolving and growing rather than some place that's too established,"" he says.
If the algorithm homes in on a particular High Street it is a vote of confidence in that town's future.
But retail experts warn that the very nature of the places that Gail's is picking means there are likely to be accusations of gentrification, increasing prices and rents for existing businesses and residents.
""Gail's is moving into areas with strong local identities. And when that happens, there will always be a reaction,"" says Kate Hardcastle, founder of Insight with Passion.
""It's not just about a bakery opening, I think it's also about what it represents. 
""Some will see it as a sign of investment and revitalisation, while others worry it's another step back to our High Streets looking like carbon copies of each other,"" she says.
In Flour, Water, Salt - a direct rival to Gail's selling sourdough bread, bagels, coffee-iced buns and sausage rolls - that is just yards from the new shop, some loyal customers are adamantly opposed to the newcomer.
""Gail's isn't welcome here,"" says Karen Pearson, a businesswoman who lives just outside Macclesfield. She and her friends are worried that the arrival of Gail's means the town is ""on the up"", when in fact they would rather it ""stayed like it is"". 
They're not keen on big corporations coming into the town, concerned they might squeeze out independents.
But firefighter and local councillor Anthony Harrison, reckons Gail's is no match for a place like Flour, Water, Salt. ""It's just a posh Greggs,"" he says.
Independents may not be as under threat as people fear, says Graham Soult, a retail consultant from the north of England.
Local owners can offer a more personal touch, respond to local tastes and demands,  he says, while it can be hard for chains to deviate from their given formula.
""I think a lot of independents are really adept at navigating all the things that are thrown at them,"" he says.
Despite difficult times, the number of independent coffee shops has risen over the last five years from 11,700 to around 12,400 now.
Flour, Water, Salt's manager Toby Johnstone isn't worried. It could mean more footfall, with more people trying his shop too.
""We are happy there's something else opening and keeping the town centre going,"" he says. ""It's good to have competition.""

Donald Trump once again acknowledged that his foolish trade wars will disrupt the economy, potentially causing a recession. But the president still spoke about the impending tariffs on Mexico and Canada as if they are paid by the exporting country rather than the American companies importing goods, who then pass the cost on to American customers.

	During an interview with Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo that aired Sunday, the host asked Trump, “Are you expecting a recession this year?”

	“I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we’re doing is very big,” Trump said.

	But he admitted that an economic “disruption” is possible.

	“There could be a little disruption. Look, what I have to do is build a strong country,” the president said when discussing the recent fall in the stock market. “You can’t really watch the stock market. If you look at China, they have a 100-year perspective. We go by quarters. And you can’t go by that.”

	In his first term, Trump often used the stock market as proof of his success. “Highest stock market EVER,” Trump boasted on social media in July 2017. But now he seems to be saying that we’ll need to wait 100 years to see the benefits of his policies.

	










	Trump also threatened to raise tariffs — currently set at 25 percent. Trump recently announced the implementation of tariffs would be delayed until April 2. But that did not stop the stock market sell-off.

	“We’re a big, big country, and they do a lot of their business with us, whereas in our case it’s much less significant,” Trump said of Canada. “We do very little with Canada by comparison, and I wanted to help the American carmakers until April 2.”

	“The tariffs could go up as time goes by, and they may go up,” Trump said.

	“We may go up with some tariffs. I don’t think we’ll go down, but we may go up,” he added.

	“For years, globalists have been ripping off the United States. They’ve been taking money away from the United States, and all we’re doing is getting some of it back, and we’re going to treat our country fairly,” Trump said. “This country has been ripped off from every nation in the world, every company in the world. We’ve been ripped off at levels never seen before, and what we’re going to do is get it back.”

	










	To “get it back,” Americans will bear the burden of increased prices, rising inflation, and an economic slump.

For investors with sufficient capital, a balanced approach might include Nvidia as a core AI ... [+] infrastructure holding and Palantir as a more minor position offering exposure to enterprise AI solutions.
The artificial intelligence revolution is quickly reshaping industries, economies and investment strategies. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) consistently capture investor attention in this space. While both are recognized as major players in the AI ecosystem, they represent fundamentally different approaches to capitalizing on the technology's exponential growth.
This article examines these AI powerhouses through multiple lenses: their core business models, technical capabilities, financial performance and prospects. We'll analyze their strengths, weaknesses, and positioning within the evolving AI landscape to determine which might represent the superior investment opportunity for different types of investors in today's market.
Artificial intelligence has evolved from a theoretical concept to an increasingly mainstream commercial reality. As of early 2025, we're witnessing the rapid proliferation of generative AI applications across industries following the breakthrough success of large language models. Organizations worldwide are racing to implement AI solutions to enhance productivity, reduce costs, and create innovative products and services. IDC projects global AI spending to surpass $300 billion in 2025, with a compound annual growth rate exceeding 25% through 2028.
The AI infrastructure market has become particularly critical, with demand for specialized hardware, chip, and software platforms creating supply constraints and enormous business opportunities. Recent developments, such as the Chinese research lab DeepSeek demonstrating the ability to train competitive AI models at a fraction of traditional computing power requirements, challenge conventional assumptions about AI infrastructure needs. Despite such disruptions, major tech companies, including Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and Amazon have doubled down on AI investments, with Meta planning to spend up to $65 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025, Alphabet projecting $75 billion, and Amazon potentially exceeding $100 billion in AI-related investments.
Before weighing these companies as investment opportunities, it's essential to understand their distinct business models, revenue streams and approaches to AI. While both operate in the broader AI ecosystem, they occupy very different positions. Palantir focuses on AI-powered data analytics software, while Nvidia provides the fundamental hardware infrastructure that powers much of today's AI revolution.
Palantir Technologies specializes in data integration, analytics and AI-powered decision support platforms for complex, high-stakes environments. The company offers two primary platforms: Gotham, which serves government and defense customers, and Foundry, which targets commercial enterprises across manufacturing, healthcare and financial services. Both platforms excel at integrating disparate data sources into cohesive, actionable intelligence using sophisticated AI algorithms.
What distinguishes Palantir is its focus on ""AI for the real world"" – building systems that combine human judgment with machine learning to solve concrete operational problems rather than pursuing general artificial intelligence. The company has demonstrated remarkable success in securing government contracts, including significant work with defense and intelligence agencies, providing a stable revenue base with high switching costs once implemented.
Palantir's commercial business has gained momentum more recently, with particular strength in industries dealing with complex physical operations and supply chains. The company's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), launched in 2023, represents its most direct play in the generative AI space, allowing organizations to securely connect their proprietary data to large language models while maintaining control and governance. This ""private AI"" approach addresses critical data security and intellectual property concerns that have limited enterprise AI adoption.
Nvidia Corporation, founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem, began as a graphics processing unit (GPU) manufacturer focused on gaming and visual computing. Over the past decade, the company has transformed itself into the dominant provider of computational infrastructure powering today's AI revolution. Initially designed for rendering graphics, Nvidia's GPUs proved exceptionally well-suited for the parallel processing requirements of neural networks and other AI algorithms.
The company's business model spans hardware and software. Its primary revenue stream comes from designing and selling specialized chips – particularly its data center GPUs like the H100, H200 and the newer Blackwell series – which have become the industry standard for training and running sophisticated AI models. Nvidia's latest Blackwell architecture, particularly the GB200 NVL72 system, offers performance capabilities that are 30 times faster than previous generations for AI inference tasks, positioning Nvidia to maintain its market leadership.
Beyond AI, Nvidia maintains significant gaming, professional visualization, and automotive technology business segments. However, its data center segment, driven by AI adoption, has become the company's most prominent and fastest-growing revenue source, contributing nearly 88% of total revenue. With a staggering market capitalization of $3.4 trillion as of early 2025, Nvidia has captured an astounding 98% market share in the data center GPU market, benefiting from its technological leadership and the network effects created by its extensive software ecosystem.
Both companies play crucial but fundamentally different roles in the AI ecosystem. While Nvidia provides the foundational infrastructure enabling AI development and scale deployment, Palantir focuses on applying AI technologies to solve specific business and organizational problems. Let's examine their distinct approaches and capabilities.
Palantir's strength lies in making AI operational and accessible to organizations that lack extensive technical expertise. Its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) enables clients to implement generative AI and other advanced capabilities within their existing data environments, focusing on the ""last mile"" problem deriving business value from AI technologies. This approach addresses a critical gap in the market between raw AI capabilities and practical business applications.
What distinguishes Palantir is its focus on AI orchestration rather than fundamental AI research or development. The company excels at building systems integrating various AI models (including those from other providers) with an organization's proprietary data and workflows. This positions Palantir as an AI solutions provider rather than a technology creator, helping clients navigate the complexities of implementation and achieve measurable outcomes.
Palantir is uniquely positioned to capitalize on emerging frameworks like the Stargate AI Project due to its specialized expertise in integrating disparate systems and data sources. As frameworks enable more AI systems to communicate and share capabilities, the complexity of managing these interactions within regulated, security-conscious environments increases dramatically. Palantir's proven ability to build mission-critical systems that maintain governance while enabling powerful analytics creates a natural entry point for the company to become a key implementation partner for enterprise AI deployments.
Nvidia is the fundamental enabler of modern AI, providing the computational infrastructure on which virtually all large-scale AI development depends. Its GPUs have become the de facto standard for training and running sophisticated AI models, with the company maintaining a commanding market share exceeding 80% in AI accelerators. This position gives Nvidia unparalleled influence over the direction and pace of AI advancement.
The company's AI capabilities extend well beyond hardware. Nvidia has developed a comprehensive software ecosystem, including CUDA, its parallel computing platform; various AI frameworks and libraries; and specialized tools for different AI applications. This combination of hardware and software creates significant competitive advantages and switching costs, as AI developers and researchers build their workflows around Nvidia's technology stack.
Nvidia's influence in AI continues to grow through strategic initiatives like the CUDA ecosystem, enterprise-focused AI systems, and partnerships with major cloud providers. The company has evolved from simply selling chips to offering complete AI systems and development platforms. Its newest Blackwell architecture represents significant advances in AI computing capabilities, delivering vastly improved performance and energy efficiency compared to previous generations and helping maintain Nvidia's technological lead over emerging competitors.
Both companies have delivered impressive financial results driven by AI adoption, but their scale, profitability profiles and growth trajectories differ significantly. Examining these metrics provides an important context for evaluating their relative investment potential.
Palantir has demonstrated accelerating growth and improving profitability in recent quarters, achieving GAAP profitability for six consecutive quarters as of Q3 2024. The company reported revenue of $2.4 billion for the trailing twelve months, representing year-over-year growth of 27%. This growth has been driven primarily by commercial sector expansion, with U.S. commercial revenue growing at approximately 40% year-over-year, substantially outpacing government revenue growth.
The company's gross margins remain robust at approximately 80%, reflecting the software-based nature of its business. Operating margins have improved significantly, reaching 20% on a GAAP basis, as Palantir has reduced stock-based compensation and scaled its business. The company's customer count continues to grow, particularly among commercial clients, surpassing 300 as of the latest reporting period.
Palantir's stock has experienced significant volatility in early 2025. After surging to record highs following strong earnings in early February, the stock retreated sharply amid concerns over potential U.S. defense spending cuts, tumbling 30% from its peak. Despite this pullback, PLTR remains 17% higher year-to-date and has quadrupled in value over the past year, reflecting strong long-term performance. Analysts are divided on the recent sell-off—some view it as a buying opportunity given Palantir's central role in federal data initiatives. In contrast, others point to technical indicators suggesting further downside risk if key support levels fail to hold.
Nvidia has delivered exceptional financial performance, establishing itself as one of the market's strongest growth stories. In its most recent quarter (Q3 fiscal 2025), Nvidia reported record Data Center revenue of $30.8 billion, representing a 112% year-over-year increase. Total revenues reached an all-time high of $35.1 billion, up 93.6% from the previous year, while net income grew by 108.9% to $19.3 billion.
The company's gross margins have expanded to approximately 72%, reflecting Nvidia's strong pricing power and the premium value of its AI chips. Operating margins have similarly improved, exceeding 50% on a non-GAAP basis. Net income has grown even faster than revenue, trailing twelve-month earnings growing over 150% year-over-year.
Nvidia's stock has demonstrated remarkable strength, surging 136.7% over the past 52 weeks and significantly outperforming the S&P 500 Index's 25% gain. However, the stock trades approximately 11% below its early January 2025 record high, following concerns about DeepSeek's technological breakthrough. Current market sentiment remains decisively positive, with 36 out of 43 analysts maintaining ""Strong Buy"" ratings on the stock. The mean price target suggests a potential 25.4% upside from current levels, reflecting continued optimism about Nvidia's growth prospects.
The accelerating adoption of AI creates distinct opportunities for both companies, though their positioning within this landscape differs significantly. Understanding how broader AI trends affect each company provides an essential context for evaluating their investment potential.
Palantir stands to benefit significantly from the enterprise AI implementation gap, which is the challenge organizations face when moving from AI experimentation to operational deployment. As companies increasingly focus on deriving measurable business value from AI investments, Palantir's expertise in creating practical, production-ready AI applications positions it well to capture this growing market. Their AIP platform addresses the ""last mile"" problem in AI adoption.
The company's ""private AI"" approach addresses critical concerns around data security and intellectual property that have limited enterprise AI adoption. By allowing organizations to securely connect their proprietary data to large language models while maintaining control and governance, Palantir offers a solution that balances powerful AI capabilities with enterprise requirements for security and compliance.
Palantir is positioning itself as a critical middleware layer in emerging AI ecosystems, helping organizations safely expose their data to interconnected AI systems while maintaining security and compliance. With accelerating commercial adoption, improving financial metrics, and a long track record of successfully implementing complex systems integration projects, Palantir represents a higher-risk but potentially higher-reward opportunity to invest in the infrastructure layer that will enable practical AI implementation across enterprises and government agencies.
Nvidia's position as the foundational infrastructure provider for AI development gives it unparalleled exposure to the growth of technology. As AI models grow larger and more sophisticated, the demand for advanced computational capabilities continues to increase, benefiting Nvidia disproportionately given its dominant market position. The company effectively captures value from the entire AI ecosystem rather than competing within specific application segments.
The company's technological lead appears substantial and sustainable, with its newest Blackwell architecture maintaining performance advantages over competitors. CEO Jensen Huang's recent comment about ""insane"" demand following Blackwell's broad release at the end of 2024 suggests a strong market reception. Major customers' aggressive infrastructure expansion plans further support the outlook for sustained demand growth.
Nvidia's current valuation metrics, including a P/E ratio of 40x, represent a nearly 35% discount to its 10-year average P/E ratio of 60x (March 6, 2025). Based on forward earnings expectations for fiscal 2026 of $4.44 per share, the stock trades at an even more attractive forward P/E of the low 20s. This valuation gap suggests significant potential upside, as the stock would need to appreciate by over 100% just to trade in line with its historical average P/E ratio, assuming current earnings forecasts prove accurate.
Despite their strong positions, both companies face significant risks that investors should carefully consider. For Palantir, competition from established enterprise software providers and specialized AI startups represents a growing threat. Major cloud providers increasingly offer AI implementation and orchestration tools that overlap with Palantir's offerings. The company's exposure to government contracts, particularly in defense and intelligence, creates vulnerability to policy changes and potential defense spending cuts, as evidenced by the recent stock volatility.
Palantir also faces political and reputational challenges related to its government work. This association creates controversy in some markets and may limit its commercial expansion in specific regions or industries. The company's relatively high valuation and recent stock volatility leave little room for execution missteps, with any slowdown in growth likely to result in significant share price fluctuations.
Nvidia faces different but equally substantial risks. The emergence of efficient training methods demonstrated by DeepSeek could potentially impact demand for high-end GPUs, particularly if similar approaches gain widespread adoption. While major customers like Meta Platforms suggest that any training workload reduction could be offset by increasing inference demands, as newer AI models require more computational power for operation, these evolving dynamics create uncertainty.
Competition in the AI chip market is intensifying, with both established players and startups working to develop alternative solutions. The global semiconductor supply chain remains critical to Nvidia's ability to meet surging product demand. While the company has successfully navigated previous supply constraints, maintaining sufficient manufacturing capacity and efficient distribution channels will be crucial for meeting ambitious growth expectations. Despite its strong position, Nvidia's high valuation leaves little room for execution missteps, as evidenced by a 7% decline following Q3 earnings despite strong results.
Palantir and Nvidia represent compelling but distinctly different AI investment opportunities, with the better choice depending mainly on investor priorities, time horizons and risk tolerance. For investors seeking exposure to the foundation of the AI revolution with proven financial results at a massive scale, Nvidia represents the more precise choice. Its dominant position in AI infrastructure, exceptional financial performance, and continued technological leadership make it a core holding for those looking to participate in AI's growth trajectory.
Nvidia's broader diversification across multiple segments provides some insulation against volatility in any single market. Its exceptional margins and cash generation offer downside protection, while its proven ability to execute at scale reduces operational risk. Despite a premium valuation, Nvidia's market position, technological moat and the multi-year growth runway for AI infrastructure suggest continued strong performance, with analysts expecting 43.2% year-over-year EPS growth for fiscal 2026.
Palantir offers a compelling alternative for investors seeking a smaller company with potentially higher growth upside and more direct exposure to enterprise AI adoption. Its improving financial profile, accelerating commercial growth, and positioning as an AI solutions provider rather than a pure technology creator differentiate it from other options in the space. Palantir's focus on making AI operational for organizations provides exposure to the ""last mile"" of AI implementation, representing a substantial market opportunity as enterprises move beyond experimentation to production deployment.
While Palantir has significant long-term potential with its expanding AI and data analytics capabilities, it also faces substantial competitive risks. The company’s reliance on government contracts, niche enterprise solutions, and emerging AI ambitions make it vulnerable to disruption from larger tech players with more diversified offerings. If industry giants like Microsoft, Google or Amazon further develop their AI-driven analytics platforms, Palantir could struggle to maintain its competitive edge. In contrast, Nvidia is a proven market leader with consistent revenue growth, dominant AI and GPU technology and deep industry integration. As one of the key enablers of the AI revolution, Nvidia is shaping the future rather than just participating in it. While PLTR has upside, NVDA carries significantly lower long-term risk due to its brand dominance, scalable technology, and essential role in AI infrastructure.
Bottom Line
While Palantir and Nvidia represent strong contenders in the AI space, Nvidia emerges as the superior investment for most investors, given its dominant market position, exceptional financial performance, technological leadership, and crucial role in the broader AI ecosystem. Palantir offers compelling exposure to enterprise AI implementation but comes with higher execution risk and more intense competition. For investors with sufficient capital, a balanced approach might include Nvidia as a core AI infrastructure holding and Palantir as a more minor position offering exposure to enterprise AI solutions. As with any technology investment, maintaining awareness of evolving competitive dynamics and technological shifts remains essential for long-term success."

I liked it too.I believe the ""anti-AI art"" movement is mostly emotional.
You can't launder money by watching a YouTube video that's freely available.
You can launder money through art auctions.
You can't launder money by watching a YouTube video that's freely available.Sure you can.
Just because the video is freely available to you doesn't mean it's freely available to ""sponsor"".

You can launder money through anything that involves people paying you.

Same for much other art. What is a banana taped to a wall worth?I won't even question that it can be art. But I wouldn't invest much money for it.

Sure, it looks cool, but I'm not sure why AI was needed other than for the novelty of saying it was created by AI.

...are not about art. They're about money laundering and tax avoidance
Electronic Funds Transfers?
Yes. They are also an indication that taxes are way too low.
That's a bizarre take. Other comments suggest that this is largely money lsindeting and tax *evasion*. Perhaps taxes are too *high*, if people need to go to such extremes to evade them.


Regardless, if you want to see rich people parted from their money, you should like seeing them hand it out for collections of bits
No, taxes are not ""too high"". Sociopaths like your average billionaire think they're paying too much even when they pay a pittance.
And who's ""going to extremes""?
Us really rich people hire accountants, now what they go to to earn their keep is hardly my concern.
If a government sets its tax rate to 0%, all that means is someone else is coming to tax you.
I recall in Haiti, the gangs recently decided to start charging a road toll on the main north-south route in the country. Some of the villagers were refusing to pay the tax. So the gangs came and shot 100 random people in that village. Now they're paying tax again.
The ""correct"" in what sense, son? I don't think any real dictionary has the meaning of ""correct"" that you imply as a definition of that word.
No auctions are about art, whether they are art auctions or not. You can tell this is true easily because you can't give them a painting of money in exchange for the artwork you've bid on.
So a system that is loosely based on the human brain can be trained by viewing a bunch of content and then can create variations based upon what it learned and that is a violation?  So much ""creative"" work by humans is just variations on things they learned from. You can change 20% and be safe... but if an AI does the same thing and changes 50% ... that is illegal?
Can I ban you from looking at my publically available art because you might study it can get too inspired? if you buy the art and then learn from it... you can look but you can't alter your brain and create anything even 1% similar without permission or paying for being influenced!
Seems to me we've got a complex situation forcing a deeper discussion that wasn't handled before... because we couldn't automate at high scale what humans did slowly.

Reasoning itself has been under assault for decades and that is something that has to be learned; beyond what a chimp can do it's learned behavior, capacity alone isn't enough.

It's also patently obvious that artists are trained on other people's art. I play in a band, we write our own stuff. Our influences, and who we sound like are the subject of polite conversation, not vitriolic arguments and accusations of ""theft"".
It's patently obvious the AI is trained on other peoples art. 
Yes; most AI services will have trained on other peoples' images and learned to emulate the result of a process.   That does not mean it is plagiarism.     It's a generally not well-formed and baseless claim to suggest ""AI usage is plagiarism"".
Regardless on how much it rearranges it.
AI does not ""rearrange"" other peoples' work.  Various generative AI models are developed and learn from others' work to develop the equivalent of a mathematical function or set of  procedures, or rules.
A fundamental concept for artists is You have zero ownership of procedures, styles, methods, or general ideas.
That means other people if they are good enough, and yes, even Machines or AIs can study your work closely and learn off your work,  and is not plagiarism;  Even if they gain the ability to perfectly impersonate you and draw something you never drew in the exact manner you would have done if you had ever drawn that subject.
And if you want to claim the output of AI is Plagiarism,   then first of all you need to identify WHICH AI service you are talking about,  Because they are all quite different. AI is Not a singular entity.
In some cases the model even being used is developed primarily by images authored by the person using the model.
There are also a dozen different image generation services, and they all have different models and execution environments.     For example,  proving Novelai commits plagiarms at some point does not prove anything about DALL-E;  It also does not prove the same AI commit plagiarism with all or most generations.
You would Then also furnish proof that their output is Plagiarism  generally.      Just finding examples of where a user was able to prompt one of the AIs  into infringing does not create a basis for claiming every or most image made off a service is plagiarism.
Some of these services even let you know what their dataset is.   If their potential Dataset is public,  then they gave the credits for their model,  and it is Not plagiarism when the attribution is stated.     If the service tells you  ""We used the laion5B dataset of Image, Text pairs,""   then in fact,  they have credited the contents of that dataset -  It does not matter that a human cannot possibly review 5 billion credits entries in your natural lifetime;  they have given credit where credit is due,  so their model file cannot be considered plagiarism.
Whether an author gets financially compensated or not has no affect on whether it is plagiarism or not.Not that matters either, since the evidence of plagiarism by any of the AI services is completely absent, and people like to just do a lot of handwaving.
I think we can expect more fuss and brouhaha over stuff like this for awhile, while Christie's and a few artists make money while they can off of the few people with more money than taste.
But, I think auctions with this (mostly low) caliber of art will be evanescent as artists, buyers, and public get more sophisticated or jaded as fascination-with-the-new wears off.
This stuff is too simple to make, so ""the market"" will get flooded with junk, and as the novelty wears off, people will get more sophisticated.
It's like leaverite.Leaverite is the most popular mineral collected by novice rockhounds and gem hunters.  It is not a real mineral.  When naive newbies see a specimen of such and such, no matter how worn or un-salable, they will pick it up and bag it, but experienced collectors can tell them, ""Leave 'er right there"".  That's what much of this new AI art is like.
But, that is not to be confused with legitimate art by legitimate artists using AI as just another tool for intelligent creation.  Here is the difference :
At link https://refikanadol.com/works/... [refikanadol.com] is Machine Hallucinations : ISS Dreams.AI was a tool, but the artist-engineer put a lot of hands and heads-on work into this.  The AI was a tool, like a paintbrush is a tool, but the creative concept and hard work to implement it was all him.
This past summer, I was at the Denver Art Museum.  They had an exhibit Biophilia, exploring man's relation to nature.  https://www.denverartmuseum.or... [denverartmuseum.org].  I know, because one of my photos was part of the exhibit (not bragging, just the facts - well, maybe a little).  Other items in the exhibit included full wall size computer screens running real time dynamic imagery using environmental inputs from the room to run the image generation.  It was very similar to Machine Hallucinations : ISS Dreams.  They are both indicative of where real artists are going as they explore these new media of creativity and public presentation.
In contrast, look at the three images at https://www.cnet.com/tech/serv... [cnet.com].These illustrate why, I believe, the auction in question cannot occur ad infinitum.  Auctions will continue.  AI assisted art will advance.  But, auction houses such as Christie's cannot keep putting up junk as the public gets more sophisticated.
Image 1 - Red braided space girl.Interesting.  It has a techno-futuristic vibe attuned to the AI-digital medium.  It is definitely cool that generative AI is good enough to make such a complete image, the ""this is new"" wow factor.  But, it is a weird image.  I admit I do like some of the surreal elements, but after the first look, I didn't feel anything visually or emotionally or intellectually compelling that I would ever want to view it again (but, art is personal, and you might like it).  Since it is now easy for anyone to generate hundreds or thousands of comparable images with no real artistic soul, each image becomes trivial.  It is a fad image, but to me, questionable as art.  The infatuation of the new will wear off soon enough.
Image 2 - Sunset statue in a garden.This is pure AI junk ""art"".  If you play with gen-AI art, such as MS Image Creator https://www.bing.com/images/cr... [bing.com] , this is one of the standard styles of output when artistic style is not otherwise specified.  It has a CGI videogame polygon-texture-raytrace vibe that is far more artificial than photo-realistic.  Once you have seen your first 100 or 1000 such images, it is boring.  Again, it is truly inspirational that we have the technologies to do even this much, but once you start to expect meaningful or high quality imagery, stuff like this disappoints.  This image is the sa
The market will drop when the first bootlegged copy of AI art is passed around. After that, the floodgates will open and there goes any profit.

AAPL Stock
 
Apple stock has generally shown steady growth, driven by robust demand for its iDevices, expanding margins, and share buybacks that have boosted per share earnings. However, the outlook may be turning uncertain as President Donald Trump reinforces his protectionist stance by imposing tariffs on the United States’ key trading partners—including China, Mexico, and Canada. This development poses a significant risk to Apple, which manufactures most of its products, including Macs, iPads, and iPhones, overseas.
In a downturn, Apple stock might suffer significant losses. Evidence from as recently as 2022 shows that it dropped by over 30% in just a few quarters. Could Apple’s $235 share price decline to around $160 if a similar scenario unfolds? Naturally, individual stocks tend to be more volatile than a diversified portfolio—so if you’re seeking upside with less volatility than holding a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and delivered returns of over 91% since its inception.
Why is this significant now? Apple has been steadily expanding its business through innovative products and a booming services segment. However, the current trade war introduces increased risks that must be considered.
President Trump raised the tariff on goods from China from 10% to 20%, in addition to existing duties. Since China is estimated to account for 90% of Apple’s iPhone production, according to S&P Global, this move is likely to significantly affect U.S. customers and, consequently, Apple’s sales. Although the company managed to avoid the 10% tariffs during Trump’s first term, it remains uncertain whether it can do so again. While Apple has committed $500 billion in U.S. investments and plans to hire 20,000 workers domestically, these initiatives will take several years to materialize. If Trump’s tariffs are applied to Apple’s products, the resulting costs will have to be absorbed by either Apple (through reduced margins), its customers (who would pay more for their iDevices), or wireless carriers (which might pass on the burden via higher device subsidies). In any case, if the tariffs are enacted, Apple’s sales volumes or profit margins could be adversely affected.
Trump’s aggressive policies on tariffs and immigration have also raised concerns about a potential resurgence of inflation. As a result, the U.S. economy might face significant challenges—and possibly a recession—as explained in our analysis on the macro picture. When you factor in the heightened geopolitical uncertainty from the new Trump administration’s bold actions, these risks become even more critical. Moreover, with the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict and uncertain trade conditions, tariffs that raise import costs tend to lead to higher prices, lower disposable income, and reduced consumer spending. This is particularly unfavorable for Apple, which relies heavily on discretionary spending. Additionally, as smartphone feature upgrades become more incremental, consumers in a fragile economy are likely to hold on to their devices longer—potentially hurting Apple even more.
AAPL stock is often seen as a safe haven and has been more resilient than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some recent downturns. Concerned about how a market crash might affect AAPL stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Apple Stock Go In A Market Crash? provides a detailed analysis of the stock’s performance during and after previous market crashes.
In summary, it doesn’t help that Apple’s stock remains expensive, trading at nearly 34x consensus FY’25 earnings. To make matters worse, Apple’s Revenues have only grown marginally in recent years. Apple’s top line has increased at an average rate of 2.3% per year over the past 3 years, compared to 9.8% for the S&P 500.
Given this deceleration in growth and the broader economic uncertainties, ask yourself the question: do you plan to hold onto your Apple stock now, or would you panic and sell if it starts falling to $200, $160, or even lower? Holding on to a declining stock is never easy. Trefis collaborates with Empirical Asset Management—a Boston-area wealth manager—whose asset allocation strategies yielded positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P lost more than 40%. Empirical has integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio in this asset allocation framework to provide clients better returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; a less volatile alternative, as shown in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Anker’s Soundcore brand has established itself as a fantastic, wallet-friendly audio brand, and the new Liberty 4 Pro continues that tradition. It is feature-packed, sounds great, and has enough battery life to get you through a day.
Punchy bass and mids
Excellent power output
Stays put during sweaty runs and hikes
Bright, potentially fatiguing highs
False “audio ducking” activations

A few earbuds with charging cases that had expanded features dropped in 2024. Some were gimmicky, while others clearly put some thought into making things practical.
The Liberty 4 Pro is the latter, and not only do they sound good, but they also give you some valuable controls for your earbuds when you’re in Zoom meetings or just listening from the desktop and want to control your sound.
Here are my full thoughts on the Soundcore Liberty 4 Pro.

The Soundcore Liberty 4 Pro are available from soundcore.com and Amazon for $130. You can pick up a pair in Glossy Black, White, and Glossy Light Blue.
The Liberty 4 NC went on sale pretty regularly, and the Liberty 4 Pro did see a $30 price drop during the holiday season, so it’s reasonable to think you’d be able to get a better deal if you’re patient.

Let’s get right to it! The sound produced by the Liberty 4 Pros is powerful! You get a soundstage with headroom to spare, boomy bass, punchy mids, and output that has you rarely needing to raise the source volume higher than around 65% of max.
Though not the highest durability rating, the Liberty 4 Pro should be able to handle whatever workouts you throw at them with an IP55 rating for water and dust ingress. They ship with Bluetooth 5.3 and LDAC codec support for hi-res wireless audio, along with Spatial Audio support. You get Easy Chat, which is an audio ducking feature that “hears” conversation and lowers the audio volume so you can carry on a conversation.
There are a lot of customization options on board here, including five additional earbud tips in the box, not including the medium ear tips that are installed by default. The remaining wealth of options can be found in the app. More on that in a moment.

The big marketing push with this latest iteration of the Liberty from Anker’s Soundcore brand is the case. It has some cool features that are expanded when you use the app. The default is that when you take the earbuds out of their case, you’ll automatically see the battery status, and then the screen transitions to controlling ANC.
This isn’t a touch screen likely because it’s so tiny that your finger would cover the majority of the screen real estate. Instead, you get a touch bar below the screen to control the ANC slider.
Going into the app and the Charging Case Settings menu, you can turn on spatial audio controls, atmospheric ANC status display, a Find Device feature that allows you to ring the case and earbuds independently if you can’t find them, and a remote camera shutter function if your phone supports it. My Pixel 9 did support it and worked flawlessly as long as the camera was launched first on the phone.

My only gripe is that with the transparent lid shut, you can only control the default setting, ANC. When activated from the app, all other options can only be accessed with the lid in the open position.
I wonder how many people will use the case, though, because you can access ANC and spatial audio options from Android and iOS widgets. The Find Device functionality is likely the only case function that is worth pulling the case out for most people.

I think that the case functions will be most useful as a desktop remote extension of the app like a smartwatch is, to a great degree, a useful extension of your phone. Unlike your phone, you don’t need to unlock the case to access the default features or those you add to it via the app. So, the case sitting on your desktop while you’re doing work is the ideal use case for the touch bar and smart display.
As the Liberty 4 NC did, the Liberty Pro gives you a lot of features for a reasonable price. Battery life is just under six hours in my testing at 65% of max volume on my Google Pixel 9. The great thing is that you can get four hours of playback time with just five minutes inside the charging case.
The battery isn’t the only aspect that has juice! The power output is wonderful. On a Pixel 9 and iPhone 16 Pro Max, I rarely had to have the volume higher than 65%. A pet peeve of mine is Bluetooth earbuds that require me to crank the volume to the maximum to get robust audio.
For a $130 pair of earbuds and in true Soundcore style, the Liberty 4 Pros punch above their weight. They’re definitely tuned for popular music, but their clarity and sub-bass extension are delightful.
Listening to Charles Mingus’ “Moanin’,” you get a very clear sonic picture of the beautifully layered instrumentation. The horns are crisp, the upright bass is thumping with a deep resonance, and the sparse vocals that are layered somewhat in the background are easily audible.
However, there’s more moanin’ to be had. Art Blakey’s version of “Moanin’” is where you get a sense of just how bright the Liberty 4 Pro can be as the horns on that composition become fatiguing after a bit. As entertaining as the sound profile is, it doesn’t sacrifice anything at the higher frequencies.
Listening to other tracks like the “Sikiliza Kwa Wahenga” from the “Get Out” soundtrack and “Violin Duel” from the “Chevalier” soundtrack show off the enormous soundstage of these mid-level Bluetooth earbuds.

The Liberty 4 Pro is indeed a solid performer, but nothing is perfect. As intriguing as the Smart Display and its functionality are, I’m not a huge fan of the fact that you’ll have to open the case for anything other than the ANC slider option. You can see through the case, so why have to open it for other functions?
Regarding sound quality, the 4 Pros can be a bit bright, so depending on the genre, your listening session may become a tad fatiguing. Thankfully, if that’s the case, there are EQ options to help tamp down that top end a bit.
And you'll definitely want to play with the different sound profiles a bit. Out of the box, the Liberty 4 Pro is definitely tuned for popular music, so the sonics are heavier on the low end and a tad lighter when it comes to nuance.
The previous generation Liberty 4 NC has better noise canceling, so if you’re asking if you should upgrade to these, I’d say “no.” ANC isn’t significantly better with the 4 NC, but it is enough of a difference, without a significant difference in sound quality, that an upgrade is far from necessary.
Last, depending on the fit of your ears, the earbud volume controls could be a bit of an annoyance. You use a sliding motion on the stems to increase or decrease volume. It works quite well, as do all of the other controls, but sliding at the stem could dislodge the earbuds a bit.

We saw some fantastic competitors emerge in 2024 in the mid-range noise-canceling earbuds market, so you have some solid alternatives here. First, I’d take a look at both Nothing earbuds, the Nothing Ear (a) and Nothing Ear 2024. The latter fully competes on features with the Liberty 4 Pro, though its case isn’t as “smart.” They do have better EQ settings with the ability to adjust frequency bandwidth, but it will cost you roughly $20 more.
You also have ‘buds like the OnePlus Buds Pro 3, the JBL Live Pro 2 TWS, and a shrewd buy if you pick up one of Jabra’s “end of life” Elite 10 (gen 1) or Elite 8 Active earbuds. All are solid competitors to the Liberty 4 Pro, though if you prefer the stem style, you’ll want to skip Jabra’s products.
You should buy Soundcore's Liberty 4 Pro if...
You shouldn't buy Soundcore's Liberty 4 Pro if...
The Liberty 4 Pro gives you a case that is larger than the previous generation Liberty 4 NC, but you’ll have to decide if its features are worth the increase in size. In every other metric, the experience you get is quite good for earbuds in the mid-range market, especially considering that you’ll save around $30 compared to some competitors.
For solid music reproduction, great call quality, and the ability to use the case as a desktop extension for controls, you should definitely take a look at Soundcore’s Liberty 4 Pro if you’re in the market for mid-range Bluetooth earbuds.


Smart case, smart price
The Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 Pro features a smart charging case, but its relatively low cost and solid sound are the stars of the show. If you already own the Liberty 4 NC, it isn't time to upgrade, but other, older earbuds may be reason enough.

Pope Francis, who has been unable to appear in public for several weeks due to ill health, released a prayer on Sunday thanking hospital staff for his care. 
The pontiff has been receiving treatment at a Rome hospital for nearly a month, and the Vatican announced that he is experiencing a ""gradual, mild improvement"" in his health, and remains in stable condition.
According to a health update from the Holy See Press Office on Saturday, Francis has shown ""a good response to the therapies,"" but doctors at Rome's Gemelli Hospital continue to consider his prognosis as ""guarded,"" which means the outcome is still uncertain.
The 88-year-old entered the hospital on Feb. 14 for a case of bronchitis. Francis had part of his lung removed in his twenties due to an infection, and he was briefly hospitalized for a case of bronchitis in 2023.
But his most recent hospitalization has been marked by several complications. Shortly after being admitted in mid-February, Francis suffered a ""polymicrobial infection of the respiratory tract,"" which lengthened his hospital stay. The pope was then diagnosed with bilateral pneumonia and given supplemental oxygen. He has also been afflicted by several episodes of ""acute respiratory crisis.""
On Saturday, the Holy See Press Office said Francis had remained in stable condition for the last few days, with stable blood work results and no fever. The pope was resting Sunday morning after a quiet night, Vatican officials said.
In the text of the Sunday Angelus prayer prepared by the pope and released by the Vatican, Francis called for a ""miracle of tenderness"" for those experiencing hardship and thanked healthcare workers across the globe.
""During my prolonged hospitalization here,"" Francis said in the prayer, ""I too experience the thoughtfulness of service and the tenderness of care, in particular from the doctors and healthcare workers, whom I thank from the bottom of my heart.""
The pope also offered a prayer for people living in countries experiencing armed conflicts, and thanked those who volunteer in their local communities, as the Jubilee for the World of Volunteering event was taking place in Rome over the weekend.
""In our societies, too enslaved to market logic, where everything risks being subject to the criterion of interest and the quest for profit,"" Francis said, ""volunteering is prophecy and a sign of hope, because it bears witness to the primacy of gratuitousness, solidarity, and service to those most in need.""

Yet companies keep using them over and over.
In 2001, after the 9/11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center upended American travel, layoffs rippled through the airline industry.
By late September, ~81k jobs had been cut industry-wide. Nearly everyone made cuts, from bargain carriers like Frontier and Spirit to heavyweights like American, US Airways, and United, which each laid off between 15%-23% of their workers. 
The lone holdout was Southwest Airlines.
It delayed purchases of new planes and nixed a renovation of its corporate headquarters, but it didn’t enact layoffs. Co-founder and former CEO Herb Kelleher saw them as anathema for a successful company.
“Nothing kills your company’s culture like layoffs,” Kelleher once said.
If that’s true, then company culture has experienced an economy-wide massacre in recent years:
Even Southwest joined the club, announcing mass layoffs for the first time in over 50 years in February. Kelleher wasn’t around to see them. He died in 2019.

Research has consistently shown he was right about layoffs: They’re damaging to companies — especially when done for cost-cutting purposes; they’re damaging to laid off employees, who’ve seen higher rates of suicide in the aftermath of layoffs; and they’re damaging to the employees who keep their jobs.
So why do companies keep doing them?
Once upon a time, US businesses had far more people who thought like Herb Kelleher.
In the middle of the 20th century, as America entered an era of unprecedented prosperity, influential companies practiced a form of capitalism that balanced profits with employee welfare and the public good. Seasonal employees got axed at times, but mass layoffs were relatively rare, as workers routinely stayed at a single company for much of their career.
Things changed starting around the 1980s. As companies sought to rebound from a nationwide economic funk, they began practicing a more rough-and-tumble capitalism that prized shareholder value and ushered in a “free agent” model of employment. Celebrity CEOs like “Neutron” Jack Welch and “Chainsaw” Al Dunlap popularized a style of management predicated on reducing costs to produce short-term profits.

One of their favorite tools was mass layoffs.
Welch, who ran General Electric, laid off more than 100k employees during his 20-year tenure. Every fiscal year, he’d rank workers and slash the bottom 10%. Dunlap’s strategy was to cut quickly and deeply — and ask questions later.
“My philosophy is to err on the side of too much,” Dunlap wrote in his memoir, Mean Business. “Too many asset sales. Too many layoffs.”
Plenty of corporations followed their example:

Olivia Heller/The Hustle
“All of a sudden,” David Gelles, author of the Welch biography The Man Who Broke Capitalism, told NPR, “other CEOs saw that…if we rapidly wind down the cost of our labor, we could potentially see a meaningful increase in earnings per share for the next quarter and Wall Street sure liked that.”
That ethos remains today. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that 1.5m-2m Americans are typically laid off or discharged every month, a number that increases during recessions.
But the belief that company earnings and stock prices increase through layoffs typically doesn’t match reality.
At best, research indicates that companies that lay off employees, on average, don’t see a better financial payoff in the long term compared to companies with a stable employment base.
And they often fare worse. There are findings that suggest layoffs lead to both short-term and long term issues, including:
Even during bad economies, when layoffs are rampant and often more justified, the results are similar — and that’s according to Bain & Company, which, ironically, consults for firms that make cuts. After the early-2000s dotcom bust, Bain researchers found that stock prices for S&P 500 companies that had no layoffs or laid off less than 3% of their workforce increased an average of 9% in the next year.
Meanwhile, stock prices were flat in companies that laid off between 3%-10% of their workers, and prices plummeted 38% for companies that laid off more than 10%.

Some of these issues stem from the fact that a company that does layoffs is typically in distressed shape already. But experts have found several other reasons for why layoffs lead to negative results: 
As they recruit, these companies often find their reputation has been damaged among potential applicants, says Wayne Cascio, a professor emeritus at the University of Colorado Denver who’s researched layoffs for decades. “If they have two offers and one is with a company that just had layoffs last year and another one is with a company that hasn’t had layoffs, which one are you going to pick?”
Plus, the employees who survive layoffs grow discontent with the company and burn out faster as they handle more tasks, Cascio adds, leading to expensive voluntary worker exits.
Layoffs don’t always portend future problems: Companies who enact them as part of a broader change in strategy, Cascio says, fare better than those who enact them simply to cut costs.
It’s also true that recent layoffs among some tech brands have been accompanied by positive reactions from investors:
Some tech layoffs fit into a category that Cascio describes as proactive downsizing. The companies were relatively healthy but realized they’d hired too much during the pandemic or saw signs of struggles down the road that they believed they could avoid with restructuring.

Olivia Heller/The Hustle
Still, says Jeffrey Pfeffer, a Stanford University Graduate School of Business professor and expert on organizational behavior, “the tech layoffs make no sense to me.” He attributes some of them to a contagion effect that led to companies enacting layoffs simply because everyone else did it.
And if overhiring or underperformance was the true problem, Pfeffer says the companies should question their leaders, who green-lit the overhiring and may have failed to develop productive roles for their employees.
“You could blame the workforce,” he says, “or the managers and leaders who are leading that workforce.”
Some companies clearly trust management over the workforce. After a layoffs announcement last month, Meta doubled the potential amount of bonuses its executives can receive this year.
So, what are the best alternatives to layoffs?
As Southwest Airlines showed in 2001, companies can reduce expenses by delaying purchases and investments, cutting in places that don’t lead to job losses.
If that’s not enough, Wayne Cascio says companies should attempt to reduce hours or initiate furloughs (a temporary unpaid leave of absence) rather than layoffs. His research has shown that, even if layoffs occur, companies that try these alternatives perform better than those who instantly lay off employees when faced with financial problems.
At least during the pandemic, many companies showed a willingness to delay or resist layoffs. Cascio says that a survey from the Society for Human Resources Management found that a majority of firms enacted furloughs or cut travel and employee perks before laying off workers.

Olivia Heller/The Hustle
Still, as the last few years have shown, layoffs are happening — and often without any signs that they’re indicative of larger strategic moves. The problem, Cascio says, is that there are only two ways to make money in business: growing revenues or cutting costs.
Slashing costs is a far more predictable way to ensure future growth than finding new ways to generate revenue. And, too often, companies do the predictable thing.
Pfeffer was reminded of this impulse on a recent flight when he got upgraded to first class and ended up next to an airline executive. The industry had used buyouts and layoffs to shrink staff sizes during the pandemic and faced difficulties in refilling positions when demand picked up.
Pfeffer told the executive the layoffs had been a terrible idea. Then he asked him if his airline had gotten rid of any airplanes when business was down. The executive said it had not.
“So why,” Pfeffer says, “get rid of employees?”

18,2025-03-09,"What would you do with dozens and dozens of outdated Chromebooks that are no longer getting updates from the Google Mothership? It’s a situation that plenty of schools will have to deal with in the near future, and we can only help that those institutions have students as clever as [Varun Biniwale] and his friend [Aksel Salmi] to lean on — as they managed to recycle ten of these outdated laptops into an impressive video display.
There’s actually two write-ups for this particular story, with [Varun] documenting the modification of the Chromebooks and the software developed to play the video between them, and [Aksel] covering how the hardware was ultimately attached to the wall via bespoke 3D printed mounting brackets.

The general idea with this project was to strip each Chromebook down to just a motherboard and an LCD, stick them on the wall, and then play the same video on all of them at once. This sounds relatively easy, but they quickly found out that the limited hackability of ChromeOS to be a limiting factor.
So the decision was made to remove the physical write protection screws from each computer, which would allow for the installation of a standard Linux distribution. Once running stock Debian, it took some custom scripts to get each machine to boot up into Chromium and point at the appropriate web page. From there, socket.io is used to synchronize the playback of the carefully prepared video file.
On the other side of the project, [Aksel] shows the logistics of taking the machines apart and getting them ready for their new jig. Initial experiments focused on mounting the hardware to a laser-cut piece of acrylic, which looked good, but simply wasn’t robust enough. In the end, the solution was a highly customized 3D printed mount which holds the motherboard securely while also providing a place to attach each LCD.
End-of-life Chromebooks can be had for pennies on the dollar, and they’ll only become more common with time, so we’re eager to see what folks end up doing with them. Between the hardware and software aspects of this particular hack, we’re sure there’s a trick or two you’ll pick up from this one.

I keep using my outdated Chromebooks, though I find that more and more websites break when I try to load them. I can no longer view a usable homepage on YouTube, anything from Reddit fails to load, Github is janky, and every time I type a comment on Facebook or in Facebook Messenger, the first letter is duplicated.  But I can still watch YouTube videos if I have its URL,  Hackaday works greatm and all the websites I maintain work just fine, since it isn’t hard to make a website work on an older Chromebook.  RESIST EWASTE!
Just throw linux on em.
I have a bunch of EOL Chromebooks running linux that I use for projects. Quite a deal too at about $30 each.
Right on man – that’s what I’ve done and also some with shoehorned Chromium on them.
If you can install linux, another use is to turn it into a smart mirror. The mirror needs to be see-through one way, but it can be any size. Obviously the smart part will only be the size of the screen.
I have always wanted to build a starship bridge with one of every video device made—all NORAD style.
If nothing else—put these under a huge TOS ENTERPRISE screen and make them chaser lights
tfw nobody knows about the chultrabook, mrchomebox’s coreboot builds, and tinycore linux trifecta for keeping old chromebooks from being ewaste. mrchromebox’s firmware in particular kept my X131e chromebook useful for five more years than it would’ve been, considering how the school district who’d surplussed it hadn’t bothered to unenroll any old machines from their MDM, making it impossible to use normally.
I’ve tried a few Chromebook Linux installation hacks, and none of them quite worked quite the way I wanted (and some failed completely).  But thanks, I will give this one a try! I have something like six or seven Chromebooks from various manufacturers, some of which are still getting updates.  They’re great for light web browsing in a bathtub.
I have one in the closet I bring out every couple of years to cuss at and see the state of the world in chromebook solutions but had not come across the mrchromebox fw.  Looks like I have a weekend project.  Thanks for sharing!  Much like Gus, I had tried a few distros and overlays but nothing that made it usable.  I am excited after the first few reads on the mrcbfw and hope this solves a problem for the world.  There are a lot of chromebooks out there.
Wow, that Mrchromebox site is packed with info.  Quite the detailed procedure.  Don’t have a Chromebook to mess around with but now I know what to try with it if I ever come across a tossed aside, unloved one!
More better is a ChromeBox with socketed RAM and SSD.  Sometimes like a NUC.  If you can get for $20 or something because it was locked to a corporate account.  Firmware flashing doesn’t care about that.
There are even crazy ‘Google Meet’ boxes with esoteric hardware to hack.
Letting Google collect data and information from children at schools is amazingly irresponsible. Google are far more agressive than China for collecting information and data, they monitor and record everything, and are far more likely and able to use that private data in a way thats harmful. There will be AI bots popping up in the future based entirely on data collected from Individuals, including children. They will even look like the “subject” in video, hopefully they won’t be one of your children. This is a company that is now making AI that will lead to the killing of humans. Machines that will kill families and children included, although marketed for “defence” and to kill “enemies”, this will not be the case in reality. Google and lots of other “friendly” tech companies are not your friend.

  Google and lots of other “friendly” tech companies are not your friend.

On that point, we’re in a bit of a hurry. What to do when Trump cronies start commandeering the big tech companies against Europe in his madness to extort everyone, like Musk does with Starlink? Capitulate to Russia or else all your Android phones stop working? Do we expect all consumers to suddenly root their phones and install Linux? We’re sitting on a bomb.
This isn’t Twitter don’t enshitfy it with you political bias.
In theory, can one set a dedicated server to grab streaming video of some kind, split them up and pipe section to individual Chromebook, make it like a giant LCD panel?  Or are sub-$50 used Chromebooks too slow to take data stream and put it on screen?
I tried this a while back, had a lot of trouble with the bandwidth required.
I’d love a system where you can load a video onto a server, which’ll copy the videos to the chromebooks and play them back using timecode to keep them all in sync.
Once you’ve loaded Linux on there, you’ve technically got everything you need. Just need to either find or make the software to actually manage that part of it…
This reminds me of PiWall
should’ve given me the chromebooks instead
It’s really about time for hardware and software to be forcefully decoupled. Anything I buy should come with the source code so it can be customised without reliance on the manufacturer.
Why would you remove comment about using those corporate turds for target practice with a pellet gun?
Be warned, only certain older model Chromebooks are compatible with MrChromebox’s firmware.  Newer models have write protection that cannot be bypassed.  I picked up a lot of 5 rugged ASUS C202SA Chromebooks off eBay for less than $100 a few years ago for my kids to each have a self-learning tool and me to have something to tinker with, along with spare parts.  While Linux can be installed on that model, there are a lot of quirks that make it a bit frustrating, like the odd keyboard (there is a Chromebook layout in xkb, but it is geared towards other models) and finicky soundcard (doesn’t work with all distros and produces random loud chirps during login even with the ‘pcspkr=no’ kernel boot parameter set).  Ultimately, one is much better off buying a laptop with similar specs as a Chromebook that comes with Windows preloaded, wiping the drive, and installing Linux on it than trying to do this with a Chromebook.  It would be nice if ChromeOS Flex would run on them because then they could continue to be used as up-to-date Chromebooks, but their internal soundcards don’t work in Flex, which is frustrating because Google could add those drivers to their kernel if they were willing.  Overall, my experience with Chromebooks has led me to never buy one again due to their limitations.
What’s wrong with VLC?  Odd.
I see, not designed to sync multiple streams at the back end, and possibly not designed to cut up the video for sending over the network.

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is considering taking a first step to using cryptocurrency, according to a meeting recording and other materials reviewed by ProPublica and three officials familiar with the matter. Two officials told ProPublica they believe the initiative may be a trial run for the use of crypto across the federal government.
The discussions have sparked concern among some at the department, especially about the prospect of paying recipients of major federal grants in cryptocurrency, an uninsured digital asset associated with financial speculation, dramatic swings in value and transnational crime.
The focus of the discussions so far has been experimenting with using the underlying technology that makes crypto possible â the blockchain â to monitor HUD grants. Blockchain advocates argue that the technology is valuable on its own for such purposes. But the primary use of blockchain, according to experts, is for crypto transactions.
âItâs just introducing another unregulated security into the housing market as though 2008, 2009 didnât happen,â one HUD staffer said, referring to the subprime mortgage crisis. âI donât see any way this will help anything. I see a lot of ways this could hurt,â said the official, who, like others in this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. The HUD discussions have covered the potential use of a stablecoin, a form of crypto that is pegged to another asset to avoid wild swings in value, although such swings have happened in the past.
The blockchain idea is being pushed, a HUD official told colleagues, by Irving Dennis. Dennis, the agencyâs new principal deputy chief financial officer, is a former partner at the global consulting giant EY, also commonly known by its original name, Ernst & Young. EY itself is involved in the proposal as well: An executive of the firm discussed the idea with HUD officials last month.
The crypto industry has found an ally in President Donald Trump, whose administration has tapped industryboosters to lead federal agencies, backed off investigations into crypto firms and created a âstrategic Bitcoin reserve.â (Bitcoin plunged $5,000 within an hour of the news of the reserveâs opening on Thursday.) Trump himself has significant financial interests in crypto. On Friday, the White House is scheduled to host a âcrypto summitâ with leading figures from the industry.
The proposal at HUD indicates a new way that the administration may seek to bolster the industry: by incorporating blockchain and possibly cryptocurrency into the routine spending and accounting practices of federal agencies. Itâs a move that would align with the apparent desire of Trump adviser Elon Musk to use the blockchain to monitor federal spending.
Dennis and HUD spokesperson Kasey Lovett both denied the accounts of their colleagues. âThe department has no plans for blockchain or stablecoin,â Lovett said. âEducation is not implementation.â
Robert Judson, the EY executive involved in the conversations, confirmed that they took place. âWe as a firm were having discussions with select individuals at that agency,â he said when reached by phone. Judson told ProPublica he would seek EYâs approval for a full interview, then didnât call back.
The White House, EY and Musk did not respond to requests for comment.
HUD officials held at least two meetings about the blockchain proposal last month. A list of attendees to the first meeting included staffers from the offices of the CFO and Community Planning and Development. CPD administers billions of dollars in grants that support low- and moderate-income people, including funding to develop affordable housing, run homeless shelters, support disaster recovery, relocate domestic violence survivors and build parks, sewers and community centers. It was the CFOâs office that called for the meeting, one person told ProPublica.
Also listed as a meeting attendee was Judson from EY. For years Judson has advocated for the blockchain, a digital ledger of sorts that creates an immutable record of transactions saved across multiple computers. Boosters of the technology cast it as a way to cut middlemen such as banks and credit card companies out of financial transactions and make those transactions more transparent and secure. Judson has written that the blockchain can help organizations prevent money from being siphoned off for unintended purposes. âAs digital assets such as stable coins or digital currencies take hold, more powerful applications will emerge for integrated value exchange,â he wrote. Dennis, who served as HUD CFO in the first Trump administration, also wrote, in a 2021 book, that the agency should use technology such as âblockchain, robotics, and next-generation financial management systems.â
Stablecoins are backed by reserves including traditional currency, commodities and Treasury securities. That is supposed to ensure that their value â unlike that of, say, Bitcoin â doesnât fluctuate. However, on several high-profile occasions, the value of stablecoins has done just that.
At the HUD meeting, attendees discussed a âproof of conceptâ project in which CPD would begin to track the funding going to a single CPD grant recipient and possibly subrecipients on the blockchain. The need for the project was ânot well articulated,â one attendee later wrote in meeting notes.
Following the meeting, a HUD official wrote and circulated a memo within the agency panning the idea. âWithout exaggeration, every imaginable implementation of this at HUD appears dangerous and inefficient,â the memo reads.
HUD has no difficulty tracking grant spending, the memo contended, making the new technology unnecessary. Incorporating it would be time-consuming, complicated and require extensive training. And, if the project involved paying grantees in cryptocurrency instead of dollars, it would inject volatility and unpredictability into the funding stream, even if the currency was a stablecoin.
In subsequent discussions with HUD staffers, the memoâs author described the proposal as a âbeachheadâ at HUD for the introduction of cryptocurrency, which the author compared to âmonopoly money.â
CPD officials continued to raise concerns in a follow-up meeting, a recording of which was reviewed by ProPublica. (Judson did not attend this one.) Some attendees saw merit in the blockchain idea, suggesting it could reduce inaccurate data from grant recipients and enable real-time reporting and monitoring of their spending.
âMaybe there is something that we could learn from it,â one said, âespecially if we feel like the broader federal government is moving towards some sort of stablecoin option in the future.â
One official asked why the agency was considering the project. âBecause itâs sexy,â someone replied. Another said, âIrv has asked us to pursue blockchain, so thatâs why we are looking at it,â referring to Dennis.
Many details were left unexplained at the meeting, including, crucially, whether the proposal would involve paying grantees in cryptocurrency. But some signaled that it would.
âYou can do it with what would be attached to a stable currency. That would be up to Treasury, and I think theyâre already going that way, for what itâs worth,â one official said. âIt would simulate the dollar.â
Another added, âIt would basically be a cryptocurrency that is linked to the U.S. dollar on a one-for-one basis.â
A finance official suggested the idea could be applied more broadly across HUD. âWe are looking at this for the entire enterprise. We just wanted to start in CPD,â he said. The agency is also considering the idea for the Office of Public and Indian Housing, he said, for âtenant eligibility and stuff like that.â That office serves the millions of people who live in public and federally subsidized housing.
This is not the first time that federal officials have considered incorporating the blockchain into the work of the government. Agencies including the Treasury Department, the Department of Commerce and even HUD have been involved in a study, a prototype and a working group in recent years. But those who monitor the crypto industry were not aware of as broad an application of the technology in the federal government as what HUD officials have recently discussed.
Some crypto experts were dubious. âItâs a terrible idea,â said Corey Frayer, a former official at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, where he focused on the crypto markets and financial stability. âIt is absolutely wild that anyone with any sense would consider this.â
Frayer, now at the Consumer Federation of America, warned that HUD grants paid in stablecoin could fall in value. He expressed greatest concern about the notion that the proposal could expand to other parts of the agency. If that included, for example, introducing stablecoin into the $1.3 trillion in mortgage insurance provided by the Federal Housing Administration, a fluctuation in the value of the stablecoin could have a major economic impact, he said.
âImagine a world in which all of the government involvement in the housing industry, all of the funds circulating in that environment, dropped in value by 13%,â he said, citing a 2023 episode in which a stablecoin briefly fell 13 cents below the dollar. âItâs hard to imagine that wouldnât be catastrophic.â
Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University who researches financial regulation and technology, noted that some high-profile attempts to use the blockchain for purposes unrelated to cryptocurrency have failed. She expressed skepticism that the technology would fare better in the context of government grants, where bad outcomes could harm those who depend on HUD funding to survive.
âBlockchain technology has been around for 15 years. No one wants to use it. And so now we have an attempt to force the government to use it,â she said, with âthe most vulnerable peopleâ serving âas guinea pigs.â

	President Donald Trump downplayed a stock market selloff that began immediately after he announced 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada.


	During an interview that aired Sunday on Fox News, host Maria Bartiromo asked Trump about his admission that there would be economic ""disruption"" because of his presidency.


	""Before you came into the Oval Office the first time, you were a very successful businessman, very successful real estate executive, and a lot of people said, oh, this is the business president,"" the Fox News host said. ""He's watching the stock market. He knows all about, you know, he doesn't want the market to go down. And now we've got tariffs, and the market has been going down.""


	""Well, not much, I mean, in all fairness,"" Trump said dismissively.


	""You said, look, we're going to have a disruption, but we're OK with that,"" Bartiromo noted. ""Is that what you meant? The stock market going down was the disruption? What other disruption were you alluding to?""


	""You can't really watch the stock market,"" Trump insisted. ""If you look at China, they have a hundred-year perspective. We have a quarter. We go by quarters.""


	""And you can't go by that,"" he continued. ""What we're doing is we're building a tremendous foundation for the future.""

Business leaders and investors shaking hands in meeting
I’m constantly asked by younger investors and entrepreneurs which products and companies they should invest in. Often, it’s challenging to find the products that stand out and even harder to find ones that can grow to the point of mass distribution, whether on Amazon, big-box retailers, or other means of ecommerce.
Recently, my company invested in LuxPro. Did I ever think I would be invested in a fast-growing lighting company? No. But, I’m sure my younger self would have been thrilled, as someone who played many rounds of late-night flashlight tag. However, it wasn’t my love for flashlight tag as a kid that led me on this path. It began with my business partner finding a brand they loved at Tractor Supply Company. As someone who has primarily worked in the marketing world, I know that good products can be out-marketed, and not-so-good products can be great at marketing, and from that fact, that product will become an industry leader.
However, what excites me the most is when a product has a line of both quality and tech that customers love. This investment started with a business partner's love for the product. To me, this is the first step – since an investor or entrepreneur’s appreciation for a product is a large contributor to the product’s success. Below is a simple step-by-step guide on finding great products and evaluating which ones to get behind.
It’s impossible to find a unicorn leader who is skilled at managing products, technologies, people, marketing, sales, and everything else that needs attention in a business. However, the two most important things to me are that they are good people and know their strengths.
Consider asking yourself, “Is this a good person I can trust to help the company on its best path? Are they aware of their strengths and the opportunities someone else can bring to the table?” With LuxPro, I quickly learned that the founder was a brilliant person with a product-focused mindset. However, I also saw clear opportunities for marketing and expanding partnerships. In addition, a seasoned executive was interested in joining the leadership team, which would perfectly complement a product founder.
As a business leader and investor, I’ve seen countless friends and peers try to sell me on how their product is different, even when it’s not. Over time, these companies have almost always gone out of business. In my LuxPro example, I highlighted how the founder was an innovation-focused person. But, I think what differentiates the company’s products is their unique functionality and designer patterns.
For example, consider all the remotes or other devices that wouldn’t work unless all batteries have charged. This is not the case with LuxPro flashlights. Its other features, for example, the grip, became a key customer experience factor. Knowing this, the founder then implemented additional pattern options for customers to choose from. The brand’s differentiating qualities were first noticed by my business partner, and when he started getting to know this brand, the clear differentiating factors stood out.
When looking at products, consider asking the customers what they love about them. Recently, my business partner and I learned about another company called Surface Sunscreen. It just so happens that the wife of one of my close friends was using the company’s products. Because of my lily-white skin, I asked her about it. She transparently said she liked the Surface packaging. While it may sound silly, the packaging really matters to my business partner and me, so we always ensure that a company prioritizes quality packaging or at least has plans to improve it. However, the feedback that stuck with me was how much the kids like the sunscreen and how she personally prefers it over other brands. This wasn’t the type of online review that could be gamed or bought; It was a transparent, straightforward review from a trusted source.
The funny thing about sales is that once one channel works correctly, it can attract other channels. The lighting company example above gained traction by being noticed by a couple of big-box stores that loved the product. Consequently, that paved the way for additional possibilities. With companies like these, sometimes clear growth opportunities present themselves, whether on Amazon, Walmart.com, or other online retailers.
Moreover, it can also fuel other big-box stores to express interest in the product. Big-box retailers typically would rather be one of the first couple of stores to have the product on their shelves or at least one of the stores that stock the product within a reasonable amount of time. Consumers want to frequent retailers where the brands being recommended to them are in stock. Being last to stock products inevitably makes retailers late to the party. Plus, it can affect long-term buying for the big-box stores. This is why the example of my business partner liking a product and talking to customers led to him speaking to a few friends at big-box retailers.
Overall, these are the key strategies I use to learn more about companies I’m considering investing in. This information gives me a deeper understanding of a company’s purpose and impact, so I know how my support will truly contribute to its growth. While each strategy involves critical thinking and asking thoughtful questions, they are my top recommendations for leaders to consider and implement when seeking industry-leading products to invest in."

Financial market volatility soared last week as new tariffs for Canada, Mexico, and China went into effect, and investors reacted to a potential slowdown in the U.S. from growing economic uncertainty. European developments added to the volatility as announcements for additional fiscal spending sent shivers through the bond market but provided optimism for equity investors in certain sectors. Winners were European defense stocks, international equities, and U.S. dividend payers. Losers were non-U.S. bonds, the consumer discretionary sector, and momentum stocks. Let’s examine each of these moves in more detail.
European defense stocks rally
President Donald Trump’s recent policies—such as suspending military aid to Ukraine and urging Europe to take more responsibility for its own security—have had major impacts on the global defense industry. Declining U.S. support for Ukraine has undermined confidence in American security guarantees, prompting European nations to ramp up defense spending. Meanwhile, U.S. defense stocks like Lockheed Martin have slumped amid fears of reduced demand for American-made arms.
Over the past month, European defense sector ETFs have outperformed their U.S. counterparts. The Select STOXX Europe Aerospace and Defense ETF has jumped 27.5%, while the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF has declined 4.6%. European defense companies like Rheinmetall AG, BAE Systems PLC, and Thales SA have benefited from the expected demand for military equipment and technology driven by government commitments to increase national security budgets.
Consumer staples outperform consumer discretionary stocks
There is growing evidence that the U.S. economy is losing momentum. Consumer confidence is slipping, retail sales are weakening, and both new and existing home sales are stagnating. Meanwhile, the inflation outlook is becoming more uncertain. As consumers grow cautious, their spending habits shift from discretionary purchases to essentials, prompting investors to adjust their stock market exposure accordingly. Necessities like food and hygiene products take priority over luxury goods and big-ticket items like cars. Companies such as Walmart, Costco, and Procter & Gamble, which cater to budget-conscious consumers, are well-positioned to perform relatively well if the economy enters a soft patch in the coming quarters..
The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund has significantly outperformed the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund over the last month. The defensive characteristics of consumer staples stocks helped push the ETF 4.3% higher, while the ETF focused on discretionary stocks fell 10.6%.
International bonds slump relative to the United States.
German 10-year bond yield rocketed 0.45% higher since the beginning of March, one of the largest moves in the last thirty years. Germany plans to implement significant changes to its budget, including creating a €500 billion fund to boost defense and infrastructure spending, as part of a broader plan to loosen its constitutional fiscal rules. This initiative, spearheaded by Friedrich Merz and supported by the CDU/CSU and SPD coalition, aims to address Germany’s aging infrastructure and enhance military capabilities in response to geopolitical tensions in Europe and U.S. disengagement from the continent. “My absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible to that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA,” Merz said during his first post-election interview on February 23, 2025.
Germany and other European nations plan to increase government spending over the next several years, resulting in additional bond issuance. The prospect of increased supply drove bond yields higher, leading European bonds to underperform compared to other developed debt markets. For example, the iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF (IEF) has outperformed the Vanguard Total International Bond ETF (BNDX) over the last month. IEF gained 1.0% on the back of weaker U.S. economic data, including softer PMI services and consumer activity, and demand for safe-haven assets as stocks declined. In contrast, BNDX, which has a 56% allocation to European bonds, returned -1.8%.
Investors are rotating out of momentum stocks into dividend payers
One byproduct of market volatility and economic uncertainty is the rotation out of momentum stocks into more defensive dividend-oriented stocks. Over the past month, dividend stocks, represented by the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD), have gained 2.6% relative to the iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF, which has declined 9.6%. Investors sought safety in companies with strong fundamentals and consistent dividend payouts with cheaper valuations rather than sticking with higher-valued growth stocks that have performed well over the last year. This divergence is another example of a shift in investor sentiment toward defensive strategies as macroeconomic risks persist.
Momentum stocks tend to suffer during times of uncertainty and when economic growth sputters. The Trump administration’s aggressive approach to restoring domestic manufacturing through tariffs and reducing the fiscal deficit via cutting government spending could slow the economy in the near term. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged this possibility in an appearance on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on March 7 when he said there may be a “natural adjustment as we move away from public spending to private spending.”
International stocks gain relative to the U.S.
International stocks are gaining momentum as the narrative around U.S. exceptionalism loses steam. If the U.S. economy is slowing, and other major regions like Europe are forced to bolster their domestic economies through coordinated fiscal stimulus, the environment for non-U.S. equities becomes appealing. Investors expecting this fundamental shift in outlook are moving away from U.S. stocks, which have driven global equities higher over the past two years.
For example, the Vanguard Total International Stock ETF (VXUS) has risen 3.4% over the last month despite the global volatility in financial markets, whereas the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) has declined 5.8%. Aside from the gains in Europe, Chinese equities have also delivered a very strong performance so far this year. A weaker U.S. dollar, which boosts returns on foreign investments for U.S.-based investors, is also contributing to the strong performance of non-U.S. stocks. U.S. investors who previously had limited exposure to international markets may see recent geopolitical developments as an opportunity to diversify their portfolios by increasing investments outside the U.S."

President Trump's economic policies have created significant market turbulence as his administration reshapes America's global relationships. The US withdrawal from NATO has sent shockwaves through international alliances, with European countries now scrambling to increase defense spending to unprecedented levels. What these sweeping changes will ultimately mean for investors isn't clear. The forces driving the equity, bond, currency and commodity markets will change in ways that cannot yet be predicted. So far, the main effect has been a $3 trillion reduction in the value of US stocks since the January 20 inauguration. The only rational response for investors is to stay liquid and agile as the changes continue fast and furious.
The highest conviction stocks coming into 2025 was to buy American exceptionalism by adding to the tech sector and rotate into health and energy. This strategy has faltered amid the administration's erratic behavior, while Chinese and German stocks have surged by double digits since January 20th. This coming week will be a massive test of Trump's attitude toward the market with 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum set to hit March 12th, followed by a possible government shutdown on March 14th.
NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MARCH 06:  U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent speaks at the Economic Club of ... [+] New York on March 06, 2025 in New York City. Bessent is under pressure from business leaders to justify the Trump administration's recent tariffs against Canada and Mexico, which have roiled global markets.  (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)
At a speech last Thursday to the Economic Club of New York, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized, ""Wall Street has done great, Wall Street can continue doing well, but this administration is about Main Street."" This comment contradicts the notion of a ""Trump Put"" underlying the market, which now seems dubious, especially as Trump continues to announce tariffs only to pause them, sometimes within hours.
As investors turn defensive, insurance stocks often provide a safe harbor. Two insurance providers worth examining are Root (ticker: ROOT) and Ryan Specialty Holdings (ticker: RYAN).
Root is disrupting the auto insurance industry with its technology-first approach. The company leverages artificial intelligence and telematics to price risk more accurately than traditional insurers. In a surprising turn, Root reported a fourth-quarter profit and higher sales than expected. While sales growth slowed to 68% after four straight quarters of triple-digit expansion, the company achieved its first profitable year in 2024—a significant milestone for this innovative insurer.
Looking ahead, analysts expect Root's revenue growth to moderate to 18% in Q1 and single-digit growth in subsequent quarters. The company's near-term earnings outlook shows a profitable Q1 followed by three quarters of losses, with full-year 2025 projections calling for a loss of 42 cents per share. However, Root is expected to reverse course with a profit of 81 cents per share in 2026, suggesting longer-term viability.
Ryan Specialty Holdings offers a different angle on insurance as a leading international specialty insurance organization. The company serves as a wholesale broker and underwriting manager, delivering specialized insurance solutions to retail insurance brokers and their clients. Ryan has demonstrated consistent growth through both organic expansion and strategic acquisitions since going public in 2021.
The company's steady performance stems from its focus on specialty insurance markets that typically command higher margins than standard insurance lines. With over 3,700 professionals across more than 50 offices worldwide, Ryan's diversified presence helps insulate it from regional economic disruptions.
While both companies operate in the insurance sector, they represent different risk profiles and growth trajectories. Root offers higher growth potential but with greater volatility, while Ryan provides more stable returns from its established specialty business model.

As market uncertainty increases amid policy shifts and potential economic disruptions, these insurance stocks may offer investors both defensive positioning and growth opportunities. The insurance sector historically performs well during periods of market volatility, as demand for risk management products remains stable regardless of economic conditions.
For investors looking to weather the current market turbulence while maintaining exposure to potential growth, companies like Root and Ryan Specialty Holdings deserve consideration. Their distinct business models provide different entry points into the insurance sector, allowing investors to align their choices with their risk tolerance and investment horizons.

29,2025-03-09,"President Donald Trump did not deny there could be a recession this year under his leadership, telling Fox News there would be a “period of transition” as his economic policies take effect, as the president’s rapidly shifting tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada have rattled the stock market and led to warnings of an economic downturn.
President Donald Trump speaks before signing executive orders in the Oval Office of the White House ... [+] on March 6 in Washington, DC.
“Sunday Morning Futures” host Maria Bartiromo asked Trump whether he expected there would be a recession this year, to which Trump responded, “I hate to predict things like that.”
“There is a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big,” Trump said about implementing his economic agenda like tariffs, adding, “It takes a little time, but I think [his agenda] should be great for us.”
The president also downplayed the stock market dropping over the past week in response to his tariffs, telling Bartiromo the market hadn’t gone down by “much” and saying he “can’t really watch the stock market” as he implements his economic policies, adding, “You can’t go by that, you have to do what’s right.”
Economists upped the odds of a recession this week and cited Trump’s economic policies as the “key risk” that could cause one, amid troubling indicators like lower consumer sentiment, mounting layoffs and the stock market’s decline, with the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta projecting March 6 that the U.S.’ economic output will contract by an annualized rate of -2.4% in 2025’s first quarter.
The stock market also suffered its worst week in six months amid uncertainty over Trump’s tariffs, with Nvidia and Tesla having the biggest declines.
Trump is expected to implement more tariffs this week, as Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told “Meet the Press” on Sunday that tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum will take effect Wednesday. Trump is also planning to implement reciprocal tariffs on foreign goods—meaning the U.S. will tax a nation’s imports at the same rate they tax U.S. exports—starting April 2. The president suggested the frequent flip-flops in his tariff policies could continue, telling Bartiromo the tariff rates he’s announced “won’t go down, but we may go up.” When Bartiromo asked whether companies can expect more predictability from Trump’s economic agenda, the president demurred, saying, “Well I think so, but you know, the tariffs could go up as time goes by.”
Lutnick downplayed fears of a recession much more than Trump on “Meet the Press” on Sunday, saying right before Trump’s Fox interview aired, “There’s going to be no recession in America.” “Donald Trump is bringing growth to America. I would never bet on a recession. No chance,” Lutnick said, after responding, “Absolutely not,” when asked if Americans should brace for a recession.
The National Bureau of Economic Research broadly defines a recession as a “significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months,” though more specific definitions of the term say a recession happens when there’s negative growth in the nation’s gross domestic product for at least two consecutive quarters.
Trump on Tuesday imposed 25% tariffs on imported goods from Canada and Mexico, as well as higher tariffs on China, only to later pull back on those fees. He paused tariffs on auto imports from Canada and Mexico for one month and temporarily exempted all goods that are covered under the U.S.’ free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada until April 2. In addition to planned reciprocal tariffs and taxing imports of steel and aluminum, Trump has also suggested he could still impose higher tariffs on Canadian lumber and dairy.
Trump’s tariffs are a centerpiece of his economic agenda, but have been sharply criticized by economists, who have long warned his tariffs will raise prices for American consumers and could ultimately harm the nation’s economy. Some companies including Best Buy and Target suggested they were planning to raise prices as a result of Trump’s tariffs taking effect, sparking further criticism of the tariffs’ impacts on Americans. Trump repeatedly claimed before the election that his tariffs would only harm foreign countries and not raise prices, but he and his administration’s top officials have more recently acknowledged the policy could lead to higher prices—while insisting the temporary increase is necessary to achieve longer-term economic goals. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC on Friday the economy could need to have a “detox period,” after saying Thursday the American dream was not primarily about “access to cheap goods,” while Lutnick acknowledged to “Meet the Press” that foreign goods may get “more expensive” as the tariffs are implemented. Trump said in his speech to Congress on Tuesday that his tariffs will cause “a little disturbance, but we are OK with that.”

A bad boss gives you a low raise, but a terrible boss tries to take it from you completely. And, not only from you, but from 25% of an entire department.

After a decade riddled with layoffs, burnout, and unsuccessful interviews, Donald Malone, 65, decided it was time to take a break from the corporate world as a consultant.

        Finding alternative income has been harder than he expected, and he hasn't been able to match his previous $60,000 annual salary.
    

        After dozens of applications, the New Jersey resident found a job on Craigslist for a company that makes machines to manufacture paper and cardboard. The blue-collar position paid about half his white-collar salary but covered travel and car expenses. He also worked for various car retail companies and held a part-time security position earning $1,200 monthly, though he couldn't secure any white-collar positions.
    

        However, after a heart attack and stroke earlier this year, he hasn't worked. He's relying on his monthly Social Security payment of $2,187, which covers his mortgage, but he's worried his skills haven't kept up and that his age and time outside white-collar work may be a detriment.
    

        ""I'm not a couch potato or someone that likes to get up and just waste the day doing nothing,"" Malone said, adding he's considering taking up real estate.

        Dozens of older Americans recently told Business Insider that they've struggled to reenter the white-collar workforce after a layoff. Many suspected their age or salary expectations made them less desirable hires than younger workers, leading some to pivot careers. While some said they've embraced lower-paying blue-collar jobs as truck drivers or custodians, others have begrudgingly taken whatever job they could while applying elsewhere. BI spoke to five older Americans for this story.
    

        Older Americans have good reasons to believe their job searches have been harder this year than previously. Outside a two-month pandemic-related dip in 2020, US businesses are hiring at nearly the lowest rate since 2013. Plus, a slump in white-collar hiring means that in sectors such as marketing, banking, and finance, job postings have fallen considerably from their peaks in 2022 to below levels seen in February 2020, as reported by the job platform Indeed. Meanwhile, 2024 research from AARP found that nearly two-thirds of workers 50 or above have experienced or seen workplace age discrimination.
    

        To be sure, the unemployment rate for Americans age 55 and older was 3% as of January, which remains near historic lows. Additionally, it's not just older Americans having a harder time landing white-collar jobs. Some recent college graduates — including MBA grads from prestigious universities — are facing challenges as well.
    

        Many older workers said they've embraced that some income is better than none, even if the work doesn't align with long-term goals.
    

        Eric Nielsen, 50, worked for much of his career as an account and sales executive at financial institutions. He recalled rubbing elbows with billionaires and earning good money, but after a layoff in 2023, he's resorted to side hustles.
    

        ""What happens is you turn 50, and you're going to be getting interviewed by someone that might be half your age, and they're not going to make a connection with you,"" said Nielsen, who lives in Colorado. ""I'm willing to go work at McDonald's or Burger King, which I was never willing to do when I was younger.""
    

        Nielsen works for a nonprofit and holds other part-time gig positions, including Uber Eats and hosting wine parties. He said he's sent out dozens of unsuccessful applications, many of which were for roles with hundreds of candidates.
    

        He said he's been on the brink of homelessness. Last year, he made about $27,000. He said he has about $60,000 in student loan debt from his master's degree, which some people have told him to take off his rsum to not appear overqualified.
    

        ""I'm just trying to hang in there to see if I can get that job offer,"" Nielsen said. ""I realize I'm not going to make a million dollars, but maybe I can get in that $65,000 to $80,000 window.""
    

        As Americans work later in their lives, many take up blue-collar jobs — some of which come with risks. In 2024, about 18% of workers in agriculture and hunting roles were 65 or older, compared to nearly 8% in retail trade, 6% in manufacturing, and over 5% in transportation and construction, BLS data shows. Dozens told BI last year that they've worked gig jobs like Uber driving; an AARP survey from 2023 found that 27% of older workers do gig work or freelance jobs.
    

        To be sure, some older workers who have applied for blue-collar roles said they're often hard to get.
    

        While some blue-collar professions have experienced worker shortages, many industries require specialized degrees or certifications that often take months or years to complete. Given the time commitment, some older Americans who worked in white-collar jobs said getting certified to work in more lucrative blue-collar industries, such as trucking or plumbing, doesn't seem realistic at this point.
    

        David Fischer, 54, held marketing roles in the Bay Area and Portland, Oregon, before a layoff last May, and he said he'd never received a negative review in his career. He's struggled to find a comparable white-collar job since, despite sending over a dozen applications daily. Though he said he has enough saved to technically retire, he said it's too early to call it quits.
    

        He applied for blue-collar jobs such as bus driving or operating a light-rail train, but he said he was rejected because the positions wanted more experienced people. He's spent much of his time attending networking events and interview workshops to get back into an office, though he acknowledges the market for his industry is saturated.
    

        ""I don't consider myself old; I know what my age number is, but I can hold my own with anybody,"" Fischer said.

35,2025-03-09,"Though sleep is a time to power down and replenish our energy, our brains remain surprisingly active when we’re at rest. In fact, more goes on behind our closed eyelids than we previously thought, according to a team of researchers that recently analyzed eye movements during slumber.
In a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature Communications, researchers in Switzerland analyzed the pupils of sleeping participants. The study reveals that our pupils constantly change size while we’re unconscious, indicating different levels of brain activationâthe brainâs response to stimuli. With further research, doctors might one day use pupil activity to diagnose conditions such as sleep disorders.
Pupil dynamics “reflect the state of arousal, or the level of brain activation in regions that are responsible for sleep-wake regulation,” said Caroline Lustenberger, a neuroscientist at ETH ZÃ¼rich and co-author of the study, in a university statement. “These observations contradict the previous assumption that, essentially, the level of arousal during sleep is low.”
The locus coeruleusâa part of the brain that regulates activation levelsâis located in the brainstem and is notoriously difficult to study while individuals are asleep, according to the researchers. Since the pupil size is known to reflect brain activity, Lustenberger and her colleagues assumed they could also be used to track brain activation during sleep.
The team claims to be the first to observe eye movements during sleep for several hours at a timeâand I know what youâre thinking: how? The featured image in this article is not a stock photoâit shows how they actually did it. The researchers simply taped one eye of each participant open, moistened it with eye ointment, and then sealed it behind a transparent bandage.
“Our main concern was that the test subjects would be unable to sleep with their eyes open. But in a dark room, most people forget that their eyes are still open and they are able to sleep,” explained Manuel Carro DomÃ­nguez, a biomedical engineer at ETH ZÃ¼rich and lead author of the study, who invented the technique.
Overall, the participantsâ pupil movement demonstrated that activation levels are constantly changing during sleep. According to the researchers, the finding confirms a biological feature in humans that previous studies had documented in rodents.
The team also noted a link between pupil dynamics during sleep and specific brain activity patterns, including brain waves involved with sleep stability and memory consolidation. Furthermore, they discovered that the intensity of the brainâs reaction to sound depends on the level of its activation, as indicated by the participantsâ pupils. However, the study did not prove whether the locus coeruleus directly influences pupil dynamics.
“We are simply observing pupil changes that are related to the level of brain activation and heart activity,” Lustenberger explained. The team aims to investigate this potential dynamic, as well as how activation levels influence sleep, in a follow-up study. If they do find a strong causal relationship, pupil movement might one day be used to detect disorders such as insomnia and post-traumatic stress disorder, or even a comatose patient’s recovery.
We havenât yet figured out if eyes are windows to the soulâbut as the team’s research shows, they’re certainly windows to the brain!

I wear sneakers more than any other footwear, so I'm extremely particular about which brands and styles I add to my collection. After seeing the Adidas Sambas all over New York City (and on celebrities like Emily Ratajkowski, Hailey Bieber, and Jennifer Lawrence), I finally got myself a pair earlier this year.
Since then, the shoes have been perpetually sold out, which my Samba-less friends complain about regularly—but my group chat just went off about a restock.
This sleek, stylish, and surprisingly durable sneaker now plays a starring role in my lineup in the Spring, and now is your chance to grab them for yourself.

Since its mid-February high, the S&P 500 has fallen by 7%, with 3% of that decline coming last week. ... [+] The Magnificent 7 has retreated by almost 16% since mid-December. (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images)
Since its mid-February high, the S&P 500 has fallen by 7%, with 3% of that decline coming last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has faired worse with a retreat of almost 16% since mid-December. The proximate cause of the pressure on stocks has been an economic growth scare and policy uncertainty surrounding tariffs.
Market Performance
The Atlanta Fed is currently forecasting a decline in U.S. economic growth in the first quarter. Much of the negative revision of its GDP forecast was due to higher imports, which likely spiked to front-run any expected tariffs on imported goods. Thus, this drag is likely to moderate over time.
The St. Louis Fed uses a different methodology, and its GDP estimate for this quarter is 2.5%. Thus, investors are left with a mixed picture in any case.
Estimated First Quarter U.S. Economic Growth
Jobs are the ultimate center of the economy. Generally, if people have jobs, salaries are sufficient to support consumer spending and, thus, economic growth.
The monthly payroll report is considered the gold standard for judging the labor market's health. Last Friday’s data showed that nonfarm payroll jobs grew by a below-consensus 151,000 in February. Perhaps a sign of creeping underlying weakness, hours worked remained at a 5-year low despite moving past the L.A. wildfires and challenging January weather conditions. The unemployment rate rose to 4.1% from 4.0%.
Monthly Job Growth
The four-week moving average for initial unemployment benefits claims has been rising. In addition, continuing claims for unemployment benefits are pushing on multi-year highs, indicating that those losing their jobs are having a more challenging time finding employment again.
The data indicates a softening labor market but is not yet weak enough to signal an imminent recession. Notably, the Sahm Rule has had no false alarms in predicting a recession and remains below the trigger level. The Sahm Rule uses a half-percentage point rise in the three-month average unemployment rate over the low of the previous twelve months to predict an economic downturn.
Initial Jobless Claims
The weaker economic data seems to be coming from soft data, like consumer confidence data. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment reading has fallen to its lowest level since 2023. Unfortunately, survey data can be unreliable as consumers often do differently than they say. On a positive note, the reading has reached these low levels previously without triggering a recession.
Consumer Sentiment
Further complicating sentiment data, political affiliation seems to significantly impact the results. Democratic consumer confidence has plunged since President Donald Trump’s election. This is not abnormal because consumer confidence among Republicans was even worse during much of former President Joe Biden’s term.
Consumer Sentiment By Political Party
While the tariffs on Canada and Mexico have been mainly postponed as of this article's writing, higher tariffs seem likely to follow. China, steel, and aluminum have already been hit with higher levies.
Taken together, China, Canada, Mexico, and the European Union account for almost 50% of imports in the U.S. Interestingly, following Covid-19 and the last trade war, supply chains have diversified away from China.
Share Of U.S. Imports: Last 12 Months
While supply chains have reduced their dependence on China, it still has the largest trade surplus with the U.S., which makes it a large target for increased tariffs. Mexico and Canada also have large trade surpluses, so they may remain targets. Notably, the U.S. has significant leverage with Canada and Mexico; their exports to the U.S. make up a large enough portion of their GDP that sizable tariffs from the U.S. would likely force their economies into recession.
The European Union has a significant trade surplus with the U.S., so they are expected to be targeted when the administration proceeds with reciprocal tariffs. Reciprocal tariffs are meant to place U.S. tariffs equal to those experienced by U.S. goods imported into that region.
Selected Countries With Large Trade Surplus With The U.S.: Last 12 Months
Without knowing the size, duration, and cost to alternatively source the impacted imported product, it is impossible to estimate the impact of any future tariffs accurately. Furthermore, possible retaliation and the second-order effects must be considered.
Generally speaking, tariffs should be a headwind to economic growth as higher prices have a tax-like impact on consumer spending. They are likely to boost inflation readings on the margin, though all the increased costs might not be passed on to consumers, and strength in the U.S. dollar could provide further offsets. Lastly, the administration can withdraw or focus the tariffs more narrowly if the costs elevate recession risks sufficiently.
The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have recently been underperforming the less economically sensitive defensive stocks. This further bolsters the argument that an economic growth scare is one cause of the recent stock weakness. While it should continue to be monitored, the relative weakness of cyclicals isn’t at the level seen before past recessions.
Cyclicals Versus Defensives
Some believe the bond market is a more accurate forecaster of economic fortunes, but it should undoubtedly be part of the mosaic to monitor the economy’s health. While the spreads on high-quality investment-grade corporate debt and high-yield junk bonds are above recent lows, the increase is insufficient to trigger substantial fear of any impending economic downturn. The spread is the yield investors demand beyond U.S. Treasury bond rates to compensate for the default risk from buying corporate bonds.
U.S. Taxable Bond Spreads
The nominal 10-year Treasury note yield ended last week at 4.30%, down from 4.79% in mid-January. This yield decline generally signals declining economic growth expectations or a flight to safety. Looking at a decomposition of the yield, most of the decrease in yield was driven by the real, after-inflation component of the yield, which fell from 2.33% in mid-January to 1.96% and points to economic growth concerns.
10-Year U.S. Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition
As the growth scare has played out, markets have begun to expect more Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025. In early January, expectations for Fed cuts fell to only one for the year but have increased to three, with the first cut expected in mid-June.
Number Of Fed Rate Cuts Expected
Though it is released with a significant lag, Tuesday's JOLTS job openings data will be closely parsed for clues as to how quickly the labor market is deteriorating.
The February consumer inflation release will be crucial as inflation has been running hot recently. Some inflation relief could more easily open the door for Fed rate cuts. Consensus and Cleveland Fed estimates are forecasting some improvement, which markets would welcome.
Consumer Inflation Estimate
Lastly, the University of Michigan consumer sentiment is scheduled for Friday. Sentiment is expected to deteriorate further, but this should be taken with a grain of salt.
While never pleasant, the recent 7% decline in stocks from the peak is well within the average intra-year decline of 14.6% experienced by the S&P 500 over the long term. If the bond market is correct, this is a growth scare and not the beginning of a real economic downturn. The policy uncertainty caused by the threatened tariffs seems likely to drive market volatility. All other things equal, uncertainty lowers the valuation investors are willing to pay for risk assets such as stocks. Typically, if the uncertainty drags on long enough, markets eventually become numb to the perceived threat. Notably, unlike in 2022, bonds have provided a safe haven as stocks have declined, which can help cushion the impact of a portfolio.
S&P 500 Intra-Year Declines
Forecasting stock swings in the short term is a mug's game, so the recent stock declines provide a reminder to keep enough safe assets to fund short-term liabilities. While stocks offer the highest annualized return long-term, they are subject to the whims of sentiment and animal spirits, so they are unreliable for funding short-term needs. Warren Buffett’s recent annual letter did a fantastic job describing the benefits of investing in great companies as a long-term hedge against inflation to retain purchasing power.

Mike Myers was back tonight as Elon Musk for another SNL cold open.

	After the March 6 closed-door cabinet meeting blow up between Marco Rubio and Elon Musk, SNL had Donald Trump brokering a truce between Secretary of State “good little Marco” and the SpaceX owner over DOGE’s root canals on the U.S. government — with some White Lotus and Dr. Evil tossed in there.

	“You’re the GOAT, you’re the scapegoat, but it is still a goat,” James Austin Johnson’s Trump told Marcello Hernández’s Rubio. “Who the hell does he think he is?” SNL’s POTUS asked himself of his 2016 GOP nomination rival. “Adrien Brody?”

	










SNL’s Rubio may think he’s the two-time Oscar winner, who gave a particularly long Oscar speech, but the show’s latest Elon proudly called himself “tech support,” as the real-life Musk does too.  




			Watch on Deadline		






	Tossing the one-liners around, some directly from the real Trump, Musk and Rubio, the best part of tonight’s Oval Office cold open was all Myers — just like last week. 

	“Phase one of my plan is complete,” Myers’ Musk said in some internal (aka voiceover) dialogue. “Ingratiate yourself to the president and take over the media. But was taking this job a bad idea? A lot of people seem to really hate me. My Tesla stock is crashing, and my personal net worth just dropped by $100 billion.”

	The Studio 8H crowd went crazy with the reference to the Austin Powers’ villain as Myers held his pinkie up to his closed mouth with Dr. Evil’s signature move.
Trump tries to broker a truce between Musk and Rubio pic.twitter.com/k7DnHjXIei

	And who is to say a fourth Austin Powers movie with Elon Musk as the long-lost offspring of Dr. Evil wouldn’t work — executive produced by Lorne Michaels, of course.

	Tonight’s SNL comes off a week that saw the Anora dominating the Oscars, Trump’s excruciating long tirade before a joint session of Congress, and more public praise of Putin by POTUS. Since Shane Gillis hosted Saturday Night Live last week, there’s also been the freezing of U.S. military shipments and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. If that wasn’t enough, the past week’s seen stock-market plunges, tariff flip-flops involving Canada and Mexico, EU and UK defense proclamations, and a very warm Sin City welcome by Ari Emanuel’s pal and UFC boss Dana White to self-declared misogynist and woman beater Andrew Tate on the eve of International Women’s Day.

	










	All of which is to say, three weeks after the almost political satire free SNL50: The Anniversary Special aired, the still early days of Trump 2.0 continues to provide SNL writers with an overload of material to choose from for cold opens and more. Plus, in a 50th season rich with cameos from superstar former cast members, the more Myers, the better.

	Being that even with all his mistakes, exploding spacecraft and other forced errors, Musk doesn’t look to be leaving Trump’s side anytime soon, hopefully there’ll be more Myers on SNL this season.

	With her Mayhem album just released on Friday, Lady Gaga is both host and musical guest on tonight’s 982nd episode of SNL. Having debuted on October 3, 2009, tonight is Joker 2 star Gaga’s fifth time as the musical guest on the NBC show. For triviaheads, it is also the second time the Grammy winner has been both musical guest and host.

Thinking graduate, man or vision on university campus, college event or school graduation ceremony ... [+] and future goals. Graduation cap, robe or student with education, learning or employment innocation
For today's high school graduates, the path to true independence can seem daunting. With rising housing costs, potential student debt, and an ever-competitive job market, many young adults find themselves living in their parents' basements long after graduation. But financial independence is possible with strategic planning and smart decisions. Here's how to build a life that includes your own space, transportation, social connections, and even savings—without moving back home.
The single largest expense most graduates face is housing. The national average rent for a one-bedroom apartment is approximately $1,700 per month, but this varies dramatically by location. Two key strategies can make this manageable:
The average car owner spends $10,700 annually on their vehicle—including payments, insurance, maintenance, and fuel. Consider these alternatives:
Maintaining friendships doesn't require expensive outings:
Let's analyze what financial independence looks like for a recent graduate with an entry-level position:
The median starting salary for bachelor's degree graduates is approximately $55,800 annually, or $4,650 monthly before taxes. After taxes (approximately 22%), your take-home pay is about $3,627 monthly.
Cost savings on expenses
With strategic choices, your monthly expenses drop from $4,145 (which exceeds your take-home pay) to $1,965—leaving you with $1,662 for savings and student loan payments.
The average graduate leaves college with approximately $33,000 in federal student loan debt. Typical repayment terms include:
Federal Stafford Loans have annual borrowing limits ($5,500 to $7,500 for dependent students, $9,500 to $12,500 for independent students). These limits exist for a reason.
Why staying within Stafford limits matters:
The danger zone: Private student loans
When students exceed federal loan limits, they often turn to private loans with:
A student who borrows $20,000 beyond their federal loans at 10% interest adds approximately $260 monthly to their debt burden—potentially consuming the budget margin that would allow independent living.
With our cost-saving strategies in place, the financial picture for a new graduate looks like this:
This allows for both debt repayment and building an emergency fund—keeping you safely out of your parents' basement.
However, adding just $20,000 in private loans changes the equation dramatically:
While still manageable, this reduces your financial security and may make emergencies more difficult to weather.
Financial independence after graduation is absolutely achievable—even with student debt—but requires deliberate choices. By keeping student debt within federal limits, embracing strategic housing choices, and adopting reasonable lifestyle adjustments, you can build a life of independence without sacrificing your financial future.
The key is thinking ahead: Every financial decision during and immediately after college shapes your path to independence. Make choices today that your future self will thank you for—preferably from the comfort of your own apartment, not your parents’ basement."

J.D. Martinez's bat still has some slug left in it. There has to be a team out there that ... [+] wants/needs his talent and expertise. (Photo by Greg Fiume/Getty Images)
Before Game 1 of the National League Championship Series, I asked J.D. Martinez, the New York Mets designated hitter, if he planned to sign another contract with his current team. He looked at me, smiled, and said, “I am a hitter for fire. Whoever wants to pay me, that’s where I’ll go.” With MLB’s regular season just a few weeks away, no one has wanted to pay him, and thus, J.D. Martinez has nowhere to go.
The story of Martinez’s circuitous route to All-Stardom has been told time and again. No Division I program recruited him out of high school in Florida. He played college ball at Nova Southeastern University before being drafted by the Houston Astros in 2009 in the 20th round, #611 overall. After three years, 24 total home runs, and an 88 OPS+, the Astros released him in 2014.
He signed with the Detroit Tigers that year for $500,000. The next season he got $3 million. Martinez worked with a hitting coach (whose name he initially wanted to keep private, but was eventually revealed to be Robert Van Scoyoc) in Los Angeles to fix his swing. It worked. In his first two years in the Motor City, he slashed .296/.350/.543 with 61 home runs, 178 RBI, and a 145 OPS+, resulting in a new two-year deal worth a total of $18.5 million.
He was sent to the Arizona Diamondbacks right before the trade deadline in 2017. In 62 games in the desert, all Martinez did was slash .302/.366/.741, for a 1.107 OPS, hit 29 home runs, and record a 170 OPS+. Things were looking good as he entered free agency for the first time going into his age-30 season.
As many Scott Boras clients are wont to do, Martinez stayed on the market throughout the winter. He signed a 5-year, $110 million deal (with multiple opt-outs) with the Boston Red Sox just as pitchers and catchers reported to spring training. He never opted-out. Over those five years, he slashed .292/.363/.526 and hit 130 homers as Boston’s everyday designated hitter.
But when he hit the free agent market again in 2023, he found few buyers. With the days of the designated designated hitter starting to wane, teams want player flexibility, athletes who can play multiple positions and who give managers more tools in their proverbial toolbox.
Martinez ultimately landed with the Dodgers for one year and $10 million. And it was more of the same for this “professional hitter.” In 113 games, he smacked 33 home runs and finished the year with a 136 OPS+. And then back on the market he went.
Again, Martinez waited. Less than a week before Opening Day, the New York Mets gave him a another 1-year contract, this one worth $12 million, but with $7.5 million of that deferred until 2034-2038. Martinez helped lead the Mets to the NLCS where they were felled by his former club. Statistically, Martinez had one of the worst years of his career, with lows not seen since his early days in Houston. When the season ended with the NLCS loss under the Dodger Stadium lights, Martinez was once-again a man without a team.
Martinez will be 38 in August. Were his numbers last year an indication that the end is near? Maybe. But there is still a lot he can bring to a club – and not just on the field. In Boston, the team made Mookie Betts “his project.” He also changed the team’s hitting program, setting up his iPad for batting practice for all the players, not just himself. His leaderships abilities have never been in question. Mets’ first baseman Pete Alonso has called Martinez a “hitting savant.”
The Yankees, with Giancarlo Stanton down with injuries to both of his elbows and no timetable for a return, are a possibility. But once Stanton returns, the team would truly have no place for someone who has played six games in the field since the end of the 2021 season.
The Minnesota Twins could use his slug and his presence, but they need to keep the designated hitter position available for Byron Buxton, Royce Lewis, and/or Carlos Correa for the moment when any of them is not healthy enough to play defense.
The Orioles might be a good fit for a player who knows the division and who can mentor their young players. And they certainly can afford him.
The Reds have too many infielders, so maybe they could use a right-handed slugger in the middle of their lineup as they try to compete in the should-be-winnable NL Central.
The Rays are an option, allowing Martinez to play close to his home in Ft. Lauderdale and be a sounding board for their (always) young lineup.
There could be a reunion in Detroit, as they were in the market for a right-handed bat, and by all accounts just missed out on Alex Bregman.
With Yordan Alvarez the second best designated hitter in baseball holding down that spot in Houston, there is no chance for a reunion there. However, there could be some symmetry if the Diamondbacks signed Martinez to nearly bookend his career. They lost him to free agency once, but he could come back, hit like he tends to, and counsel the likes of Corbin Carroll, Jake McCarthy, Blaze Alexander, Jordan Lawlar, and Alek Thomas. Could J.D. Martinez, in the lineup and in the batting cage, make Ketel Marte even better?
In 2018, after signing with the Red Sox and becoming an All-Star but before helping to lead the team to another World Series title, Martinez was asked about his slow free agency and whether his current season was some sort of vindication. His response then could have just as easily been uttered today: “My whole life, I’ve felt like I’ve always had to prove myself. It’s never been easy, as easy as others who are in my position have had it. So I’ve always felt that drive...It’s my story. It’s me.”
After 14 big league seasons, it is possible that Martinez no longer has that drive. After earning more than $150 million, he may be content to call it a career – there would be no shame in that. But, if he still wants to lace them up, pull on a pair of batting gloves, and set up his iPad on the side of the cage, some team should offer him a few million bucks to make their team better – both on the field and in the clubhouse.

In the coming days, Mark Carney will be sworn in as the 24th Prime Minister of Canada, a political novice stepping onto the ice at a moment of maximum peril, both for his party and his country.
Carney, who many years ago was the backup goalie for Harvard’s hockey team, will find himself in front of the net for a game that he can’t afford to lose. Donald Trump is threatening to use economic force to annex Canada, and Canadians are expected to go to the polls within weeks to decide who will guard the net—Carney or Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, whose populist bombast is unusually intense for Canadian politics.

It would be a daunting task for any politician, let alone a rookie. Carney has never held elected office, but Canada’s desperate Liberals gave him a strong mandate to lead their party on Sunday, with 86% of the vote on the first ballot. That decisive vote was based wholly on the strength of Carney’s CV, which Immigration Minister Marc Miller points out is noteworthy. 
Asking about Carney’s CV is “like asking someone whether War and Peace is a good book,” says Miller, who backed him to take over from Justin Trudeau. “It’s a f***ing good book.”
Read More: How Canada Fell Out of Love With Trudeau
Trudeau, who was a high-school teacher before he was elected to Parliament, had the thinnest CV of any Prime Minister in Canadian history. He swept to office with a majority government in 2015 based on his good looks, boundless energy on the campaign trail, and family name—he is the son of former Prime Minister and Liberal icon Pierre Trudeau.
Carney could hardly be more different. He lacks Trudeau’s gift for working a crowd, is not notably dashing, and his father was a high-school principal in Fort Smith, a town of 2,000 people in Canada’s far north. Where Trudeau has always been seen as a charismatic lightweight, Carney is a nose-to-the-grindstone type. He worked his way to Harvard, then Oxford University, then Goldman Sachs, then the governorship of first the Bank of Canada—where he drew global admiration for his management of the 2008 financial crisis—and then the Bank of England, where he kept Britain liquid after the U.K. voted in 2016 to leave the European Union.
Carney’s cool was tested by the chaotic Brexit years, and he made lifelong enemies among the Brexiteers. But the man who gave him the job, George Osborne, who was finance minister under Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron, thinks he did a splendid job.
Osborne recently told the CBC that Carney has the technical knowledge and the “street smarts” to cope with the trade war that Trump has imposed on Canada.
“I think if I was sending someone into bat for Canada, I’d want Mark Carney,” he said. “The Canadian with the most international experience in the whole of Canada is Mark Carney.”
Canada’s Liberals hope his experience managing crises will be enough to convince voters to re-elect them in an election expected this spring.
Canadians have watched, horrified, as Trump has repeatedly threatened to bring in 25% tariffs—which could kill up to 600,000 jobs in Canada—unless Canada agrees to become the 51st state. Trump has twice ordered tariffs, then pulled back at the last moment. Some went into effect on Tuesday, although he paused others temporarily after stock markets fell and the Big Three automakers pleaded for time. 
Canadians at first reacted to tariffs with icy fear, but that has hardened into anger and resolve. They repeatedly booed the Star Spangled Banner at hockey and basketball games, have taken bourbon off the shelves, cancelled Florida vacations, and boycotted American produce.
After Trump’s first tariff threats, Trudeau reacted by trying to shuffle Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland out of cabinet to make way for Carney. She quit instead, and Trudeau was forced to resign, which led to the succession race that Carney won on Sunday. 
The Trump factor disrupted the carefully laid plans of Poilievre, who had looked sure to win the next election. For two and half years, Poilievre had built momentum as the agent of change. A pugnacious critic with an unerring instinct for finding his opponent’s weakness, he harnessed widespread anger over the cost-of-living crisis, record immigration, and one of the world’s worst housing crises, promising a great reckoning for Trudeau’s “woke” policies. But Poilievre, who took over his party by harnessing the anger of the truckers’ protest against vaccine mandates, borrowed techniques and messages from the MAGA movement, and that now makes him vulnerable. 
When Trump started attacking Canada, and Trudeau announced his resignation, the Liberals surged in the polls. The upcoming election now looks like a dead heat. Since candidates usually get a boost coming out of a leadership convention, the Conservatives will start out as the underdogs, a shocking turnaround after two years where they were leading by 20 points and the Liberals faced electoral oblivion.
Underneath the horse-race numbers, there is more bad news for the Conservatives. Polling shows that voters are more likely to trust Carney than Poilievre to manage Trump—perhaps because part of Poilievre’s base is pro-Trump.
That doesn’t mean, though, that Carney is sure to win. Exhaustion with the Liberals is profound after almost a decade in power. On other issues—particularly climate and resource development—Carney will face challenges. He has a long record of advocating for emission reductions in financial markets—he was a U.N. climate envoy—which may make it hard for him to appeal to voters who have had enough of Liberal restrictions on oil and gas production, especially now that Canadians are wishing they had more pipelines to tidewater so that they could tell Trump where to put his tariffs.
Read More: How Canada Got Hooked on the U.S. Economy
And Carney’s win was all but a coronation. As when Kamala Harris took over from Joe Biden, there was not time enough for a proper contest to test potential replacements for Trudeau. The Liberal leadership race was compressed, and Carney was far ahead all along, so his opponents were not motivated to challenge him too much. Freeland, who was once Trudeau’s trusted right hand, looks like she wants to be on Carney’s team.
The abbreviated race means Carney is untested and may be prone to rookie mistakes. He struggled to explain a decision to move the headquarters of Brookfield Asset Management, where he was chair, from Toronto to New York. It was not a fatal mistake, but a sign that, like many from business who enter politics—he has not calibrated for the demands of public office.
He showed some charm when he teased his leadership announcement on The Daily Show in January, but he is not an electric speaker, speaks French like a bureaucrat, and has little experience debating.
Carney often says he is not a politician, contrasting himself with Poilievre, who has never done anything else. But it may be hard for a technocrat and multi-millionaire to present himself as an outsider and a change agent. Even those on his team acknowledge some trepidation.
“It's hard to go from a minister to Prime Minister,” says Miller. “It's hard to go from just a backbencher to Prime Minister. It's really hard to go from politically nothing to Prime Minister.”  
But the Liberals have no backup goalie, and the puck is about to drop.

UPDATED, 1:34 PM: After beginning offshore release last frame in Korea, director Bong Joon-ho’s home market, Warner Bros expanded Mickey 17 to a further 66 international box office hubs this session. The new overseas plays, along with the sophomore Korea frame, came in at $24.5M which is in line with pre-weekend projections, and lifts the international cume to an estimated $34.2M through today. Combined with domestic, the global weekend is $43.6M for a running worldwide total of $53.3M.

	The original sci-fi feature is an expensive swing (see Anthony’s deep dive on that here). It gave Parasite Oscar winner Bong his best opening in 59 offshore markets (including all of Europe — save for Norway — and Latin America as a region). In 25 overseas release markets, it ranked as the No. 1 U.S. title. That includes China where Ne Zha 2 continues its dominance and set a new record by crossing $2B in-market this weekend (more on that below).

	










			Watch on Deadline		






	In total for Mickey 17‘s wider launch, France ($2.9M), which leans into this sort of fare, led play behind Korea (where the running cume is $14.6M), and was followed this weekend by the UK ($2.7M), Germany ($1.3M) and Mexico ($1.3M). Japan, Poland, Vietnam and some smaller markets are still to release.

	In Imax, Mickey 17’s global cume is $6.3M for nearly 12% of the worldwide total.

	Continuing with studio results before digging into Ne Zha 2, Marvel/Disney’s Captain America: Brave New World added $9.2M from 52 overseas markets for an international cume of $194.2M and a worldwide total after four weekends of $370.8M. The offshore drop was 53% with good holds in Brazil (-25%) and Spain (-28%), notably.

	The Top 5 markets are the UK ($21.2M), Mexico ($14.5M), China ($14.3M), France ($12.8M) and Korea ($11.2M). 

	The Walt Disney Studios has grossed an estimated $994M at the global box office so far in 2025 — including results from Captain America and crossover from 2024 releases Mufasa, Moana and A Complete Unknown — and will become the first studio of the year to cross $1B when it does so this coming week.

RELATED: ‘Anora’ Gets Nice Bump In Post-Oscar Expansion, Hits No. 7 After 21 Weeks – Specialty Box Office

	Meanwhile, after crossing the $100M milestone at the international box office last week, Universal/Working Title’s Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy romanced another $7.9M from 75 offshore markets in the 4th session. The overseas total is now $103.8M (that rises to $110M+ when including Studiocanal’s France figures). 

	










	Strong play continues in the UK where the cume is now $51.1M, while Germany was off only 18% in its sophomore frame.

	Behind the UK, the Top 5 is rounded out by Australia ($8.6M), Netherlands ($5M), Poland ($4.8M) and Germany ($4.1M). 

	Also from Universal, Wicked made its way to Japan this weekend, bowing with $3.7M at No. 2 behind new local title Doraemon: Nobita. The start is well above the 3-day openings of Wonka and Barbie, and above the 3-day openings (including Friday preview days) of The Greatest Showman, Bohemian Rhapsody, The Jungle Book and Les Misérables, as well as more than double Mamma Mia 2. 

	The international cume rises to $261M for $733.8M global.

RELATED: The 25 Highest-Grossing Animated Films Of All Time At The Box Office

	Turning back to Ne Zha 2, the animated blockbuster topped $2B in China this weekend, becoming the first movie ever to achieve the milestone in a single market. Per Maoyan, the gross in China through Sunday is an estimated RMB 14.66B+ (approximately $2.028B using today’s rates). Including estimated grosses of about $31M from releases outside of China, that lifts to $2.059B worldwide. (As ever, exchange rates vary, and the numbers likely will shake out a bit over coming days.)

	As we noted earlier this week, Ne Zha 2 already passed $2B globally, becoming only the 7th movie ever to join an exclusive group that includes two Avatars, two Avengers movies, a Star Wars installment and Titanic. At today’s estimated worldwide total, Ne Zha 2 has overtaken Avengers: Infinity War to sit at No. 6 on the all-time chart. 

	While play is beginning to settle in China, the phenom continues to lead presales there through Thursday. Ticketing app Maoyan has been revising its NZ2 forecasts over the past few weeks, currently predicting a China final of RMB 15B ($2.075B).  That alone would push Ne Zha 2 above Star Wars: The Force Awakens to become the 5th highest-grossing movie in history. 

	So far, NZ2’s ex-China releases include North America, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore and some smaller markets. It releases in the UK on March 21 (previews start March 14) while other majors in Europe are pending. Japan is set for April 4.

	The Imax total through Sunday is $148M in China for $150.6M global.

	And, in Oscar-bump news, last weekend’s Best Picture winner Anora saw big uptick in overseas play for Universal with a weekend of $3.1M (+435%) in 53 markets. The international UNI cume is $18.7M, while FilmNation markets are at $9.1M. The global total is $46.2M. Mega increases were seen in Italy (+670%), Spain (1859%), Mexico (+666%), Germany (+2856%), UK (+475%), Korea (+1072%) and Netherlands (+504%).

Small Cap write on sticky notes isolated on Office Desk. Stock market concept
If Trump 2.0 rhymes with Trump 1.0, then this is an intriguing time to consider small cap dividends. Let me explain—and then we’ll highlight a handful of 11.1% to 12.6% dividend stocks.
In 2016, smaller companies popped for weeks amid largely sentiment over what President Donald Trump’s election would mean for the market broadly and small caps specifically. But that sentiment-related pop eventually turned into years of underperformance as theory became reality—and unfavorable conditions forced investors to stop betting on small caps as a group, and instead separate winners and losers.
Fast-forward to Trump 2.0. I wrote in December that small caps were soaring following Trump’s second electoral victory in hopes that reduced regulations will let these companies run free.
But shortly after that, it became clear the honeymoon was over.
Small Caps Sink
The valuation disparity between small caps (S&P 400 and S&P 600) and their large cap (S&P 500) peers is significant:
That said we can’t just blindly buy. I warned back in that December piece that “it is going to be a stock picker’s market, especially in the small space.” That increasingly looks the case—the Trump 2.0 Trade probably won’t benefit all small caps equally, which means we need to separate winners from losers.
Right now, I have my eye on five small-cap stocks, most of which Wall Street largely ignores. The yields are electric, from 11.1% to 12.6%. Let’s dive into the dividend details.
These small caps are showing impressive “relative strength” in this current market downturn. A handful of business development companies in particular. It sounds counterintuitive—BDCs generally thrive on higher interest rates (as their loans tend to be floating-rate), and both shares and dividends can suffer if rates plunge. However, moderate rate declines aren’t necessarily a backbreaker, and can even lead to better loan origination.
CION Investment (CION, 12.6% yield) is an externally managed BDC with a portfolio of 103 companies spread fairly evenly across numerous industries, though it does have double-digit concentrations in business services and healthcare/pharmaceuticals. Most of its deals are done through first-lien debt (85%), with most of the rest in equity (14%), though it does have sprinklings of second-lien and unsecured debt. Meanwhile, 81% of the portfolio is floating-rate in nature.
Non-accruals as of its last report were a little high, at 1.85% of the total investment portfolio at fair value, and up from 1.36% in June. It warrants monitoring, but it’s not egregious, especially given Cion’s admittedly limited track record.
Cion is fairly young—it direct-listed in October 2021—but has outrun many of its BDC peers thanks to generally solid results so far. And in that time, it has also splashed shareholders with cash. CION not only pays out a substantial 36-cent quarterly dividend (11.8% yield), but also small supplemental and year-end special dividends, which in 2024 tacked on an additional 80 basis points to its yield.
It might sound odd, but the base-plus-supplemental system is becoming more commonplace among BDCs—if nothing else, the optics of issuing still-high regular dividends with additional upside (should results allow) are much better than being forced into dividend cuts through down cycles.
One last note on CION: Despite their total-return outperformance of the BDC industry, shares still trade at a 22% discount to net asset value (NAV).
Oaktree Specialty Lending (OCSL, 11.7% yield) is defying gravity right now—not just because it’s up in a down market, but also because it’s up despite cutting its dividend just a month ago.
OCSL currently invests in 136 companies across 20 industries, with an emphasis on software and services, as well as health care equipment and services. It predominantly deals in first-lien debt, though it also has second-lien, unsecured, equity, and even joint-venture investments. The lion’s share (88%) of debt investments are floating-rate, but not all.
Oaktree Specialty’s February report was chock full of interesting news.
The most dominant headline to be concerned with was a change to OCSL’s dividend, from a regular quarterly program to a base-plus-supplemental system.
But Oaktree’s new 40-cent regular payout (10% yield) and 7-cent supplemental for the most recent quarter (1.7% yield when annualized) still comes out to a 15% reduction from its previous 55-cent regular dividend.
But OCSL made two other announcements worth a little attention. For one, management injected $100 million of new equity capital, and it did so at a price equal to NAV, so it wasn’t dilutive to net asset value (NAV). The company also instituted a rolling 12-quarter lookback provision that could result in lower incentive fee expenses should the portfolio suffer losses. Speaking of NAV: OCSL shares currently trade at a 9% discount to net asset value.
One of the clearest shows of relative strength has come from mortgage real estate investment trusts, especially those that deal with residential mortgages.
That’s largely because mortgage rates have been falling alongside stocks—the 30-year rate climbed above 7% in January but has since retreated to the high 6% range. That’s good news for mREITs, as declining mortgage rates should revitalize purchase originations and refinancing activities.
Also helping some names in the space has been an increasing belief that potential economic weakness could force the Federal Reserve’s hand into quicker rate cuts, which in turn would be good news for more leveraged mREITs.
A few mREITs stick out right now:
New York Mortgage Trust (NYMT, 11.8%) invests in mortgages and other securitized products, including residential mortgage loans, agency residential mortgage-backed securities, non-agency RMBSs, structured multifamily investments and more. The nearly 12% yield is great. So, is its relative strength of late (+13% since the February market peak). And so is its cheap valuation (65% of adjusted book value).
Not so great is the fact that its dividend is half of what it was three years ago, and that undepreciated earnings (a non-GAAP financial metric NYMT uses) haven’t covered the dividend over the same time span. But this mREIT still bears watching: It’s exiting JV assets that have hampered the business, and earnings are getting closer to covering the dividend.
PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust (PMT, 11.1%) is a specialty finance company that invests primarily in residential mortgage loans and mortgage-related assets, such as mortgage servicing rights, agency MBSs, government-sponsored enterprise credit risk transfers and more.
Sure, the yield is a little less than NYMT (but still enormous), hasn’t been as exuberant during the market downturn (+4%), and the bargain proposition isn’t as deep (90% of book). But historically, this has been a higher-quality mREIT than New York Mortgage Trust.
Financial results have been more consistent, and the stock has been more productive. Also, while the dividend is (like many mREITs) not exactly set in stone, it has been more dependable than most—PennyMac is actually paying more than it did since its initial public offering in 2009. Compare that to NYMT, whose dividend is 70% thinner since then.
Ellington Financial’s (EFC, 11.1%) dividend history is even worse than NYMT, off more than 80% since its 2010 IPO. But those able to stomach the risk should at least keep their eye on it. Ellington invests in just about every kind of “paper” real estate one can think of.
It primarily deals in credit such as residential transition loans, residential and commercial mortgage loans, CMBSs and collateralized loan obligations, but it also has lesser (and shrinking) dealings in agency MBS. It also boasts a reverse-mortgage arm called Longbridge that has helped drive earnings strength of late. Book value has remained solid.
Ellington did reduce the payout as recently as 2024, but dividend coverage is looking healthier. But the value proposition has winnowed—despite losing more than a quarter of its value over the past two years, recent strength has it trading pretty close to BV.

48,2025-03-09,"Bitcoin (BTC) bears looked to penetrate key support Sunday, extending a three-day losing streak as macroeconomic concerns overshadowed President Donald Trump's recent-crypto-related announcements.
The leading cryptocurrency by market value slipped over 3% to $83,200, testing the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), according to CoinDesk and TradingView data. Prices have dropped over 10% since putting highs above $92,800 Thursday.
The latest decline comes as trade tensions between the U.S. and China are set to escalate on Monday. Beijing will levy tariffs on certain U.S. agricultural goods in retaliation for President Donald Trump's latest hike on Chinese imports. The tariff war has injected significant uncertainty in the market and for policymakers.
On Friday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reaffirmed that the central bank will maintain its cautious stance on interest rates while assessing the economic impact of President Donald Trump’s policy shifts. The comments came on the heels of a soft U.S. nonfarm payrolls report and expectations for at least three Fed rate cuts this year.
According to observers, these developments, coupled with recessionary signals from the bond market, are taking focus away from Trump's recent announcement of a strategic BTC stockpile.
""Despite the very positive news, Bitcoin fell 4% from $90,000 to under $87,000 in hours. It appears focus on Trump's crypto-related actions are increasingly secondary as tariff war fears accelerate,"" analytics firm IntoTheBlock said in the weekly newsletter to subscribers Friday.
The firm added that macro concerns, mainly tariff-related, have been pushing down markets, noting the strengthening positive correlation between bitcoin, ether and U.S. stocks.
""Further actions like Trump stating he's not even looking at the stock market, and his administration targeting lower long-term interest rates instead, suggest that investor expectations of a Trump bull market may have been too eager,"" the firm said.
Noelle Acheson, the author of Crypto Is Macro Now, said in Saturday's edition that BTC's dour price action in the wake of the strategic stockpile announcement ""underscores how macro concerns still weigh heavy on crypto assets.""
The chart shows buyers stepped in below the 200-day SMA on Feb. 28 and March 2, leading to a price bounce. The market will likely keep an eye on this level to see if traders do the same again.

The automotive world just got its most fascinating paradox – a 2.7-ton pickup truck that out-accelerates sports cars while sipping fuel at 2L/100km. Meet the BYD Shark 6 DMO, a plug-in hybrid beast crashing the diesel-dominated pickup party with 435 PS (429 hp) and 650 Nm torque – numbers that make Ford Ranger Raptors look like hatchbacks.
What makes the Shark 6 DMO particularly fascinating is how it blends seemingly contradictory elements into a cohesive package. It combines the rugged utility of a pickup truck with the sophisticated electrification of a modern hybrid, wrapped in dimensions that push the boundaries of the midsize segment.
Designer: BYD Philippines






Let’s talk dimensions first, because this thing is massive. At 5,457mm long, 1,971mm wide, and 1,925mm tall, the Shark 6 DMO makes an immediate impression with its sheer size. I’ve spent time with Toyota Hilux and Ford Ranger models, and the Shark 6 dwarfs them both. With a generous 3,260mm wheelbase and substantial 230mm ground clearance, it’s positioned closer to full-size American pickups than traditional midsize offerings in the Philippine market. This size advantage translates to both interior space and genuine off-road capability.

Now for the really interesting part – the powertrain. The “DMO” designation stands for BYD’s “Super Hybrid Off-road Platform,” combining a 1.5-liter turbocharged gasoline engine with electric motors to deliver a combined output of 435 horsepower. That’s not a typo – 435 horses in a pickup truck! To put that in perspective, conventional diesel-powered competitors like the Mitsubishi Triton or Isuzu D-Max typically offer around 180-200 horsepower. Even the Ford Ranger Raptor doesn’t touch these numbers.






The integration of BYD’s Blade battery technology is a game-changer here. Despite weighing in at a hefty 2,710kg (over 2.7 tons), the electrified powertrain delivers acceleration and responsiveness that defies physics. The instant torque from those electric motors gives it a completely different character from diesel trucks that need to build boost before delivering power.

Inside, BYD has gone all-in on tech. The cabin features a large central touchscreen that controls most vehicle functions, digital instrumentation, and materials that honestly feel more premium than they have any right to in a pickup truck. It’s a far cry from the utilitarian interiors we’ve come to expect in this segment.

The drivetrain tech is equally impressive, with an advanced all-wheel-drive system featuring electronic torque vectoring. This allows for precise power distribution across all four wheels, which makes a massive difference both on-road and off. Traditional 4×4 systems can feel clunky by comparison. For the off-road crowd, there are multiple terrain modes, hill descent control, and electronic differential locks. The instant torque delivery of the electric motors gives it a unique advantage in challenging conditions – no waiting for turbos to spool up when you’re halfway up a muddy incline.

At ₱2.1-2.3 million in the Philippines ($36,500-$40,000 USD), the Shark 6 DMO isn’t cheap. But when you compare it to high-end variants of established players, the value proposition becomes clearer. You’re getting supercar-level horsepower in a pickup truck with genuine off-road capability and tech features that wouldn’t look out of place in a luxury SUV.

I know there’s still skepticism about Chinese-built vehicles, especially in a segment where Toyota and Ford have dominated for decades. But the automotive landscape is changing rapidly. Ten years ago, would anyone have predicted that a Chinese manufacturer would be producing a 435hp hybrid pickup truck? The Shark 6 DMO represents a fundamental shift in what we should expect from pickup trucks.

The real question is whether traditional pickup buyers will embrace this new approach. Truck enthusiasts tend to be conservative, valuing reliability and simplicity over cutting-edge technology. But after spending time with specs and features of the Shark 6 DMO, I’m convinced that it deserves serious consideration. The combination of raw power, advanced tech, and genuine capability makes for a compelling package.

What’s particularly fascinating is how BYD is disrupting the market through technological differentiation rather than competing on price alone. The Shark 6 DMO isn’t trying to be a budget alternative to established players – it’s offering something fundamentally different. In a segment that has seen incremental evolution for decades, this approach feels refreshing.

I’ve spent the last month living with what might be the most ambitious earbuds ever created. The Breggz Zohn-1—a $2,000 custom-fitted marvel that promises to redefine personal audio—arrived in my hands fresh from its CES 2025 debut, where it stole the spotlight from industry giants. After hundreds of hours of listening across dozens of environments, from noisy flights to quiet studios, I’ve discovered something rare: a product that genuinely changes how you experience music. While the hefty price tag will rightfully give most consumers pause, my extended time with these custom-molded earbuds has revealed capabilities that conventional wireless options simply cannot match. For those wondering if the future of premium audio is personalized, my journey with the Zohn-1 offers some compelling answers.

Designer: Breggz
When I first entered the Breggz suite at CES 2025, I’ll admit I was skeptical. The $2,000 price tag had me prepared to dismiss these as another overpriced gadget targeting the ultra-premium market. Before we did anything or even chatted, I simply wanted to experience the product—and that it did. My initial cynicism dissolved after the personalized fitting process and first listening session.






The Breggz team guided me through their digital fitting process, which creates a precise map of your ear canal. Unlike traditional universal earbuds that use silicone tips in standard sizes, the Zohn-1 shells are custom-manufactured to match your exact ear anatomy. The bio-coated ceramic and plastic composite shells felt surprisingly lightweight when placed in my ears, creating what I can only describe as a perfect acoustic seal.
What struck me immediately was the “inside-my-head” sensation that’s difficult to articulate until you’ve experienced it. The soundstage wasn’t just wide—it was three-dimensional in a way that made conventional premium earbuds suddenly feel flat and distant by comparison. As Xander de Buisonjé, the founder of Breggz, explained to me during our interview: “If you put these pieces in, it takes over your being and you’re really inside of the music, so you’re in the zone.” This is actually the inspiration behind the product name—”Zohn” (spelled Z-O-H-N to make it distinctive) literally means you’re “in the zone” when listening.

Interestingly, the pair I’m currently testing isn’t even fully custom-made, yet they fit remarkably well. A fully personalized set is on its way, adding to my anticipation of experiencing the complete precision that Breggz promises. The scanning and molding process behind these earbuds stands apart from anything typically found in consumer audio. At CES earlier this year, I completed the scanning process firsthand, experiencing how Breggz transforms a standard ear scan into a uniquely tailored fit, making custom-fitted listening more accessible than ever before.
The Breggz Scan app on iOS uses your smartphone camera to capture a 3D model of your ears. The process is straightforward—you position yourself in a well-lit area, remove any earrings or obstructions, and follow the app’s guidance to rotate your phone around your ear. The app captures multiple angles and stitches them into a 3D model of your ear’s unique contours.






De Buisonjé told me they went through twelve iterations before getting the scanning technology right. “We needed to make it very clear how far from the ear you need to be and how to turn the phone to capture these short movies of your ear,” he explained.


Once your scan is complete, the data goes to Breggz’s platform, where software refines it into a production-ready 3D model. The software identifies the optimal shape for a perfect seal and determines the precise placement of the balanced armature drivers.







Industrial-grade 3D printers then produce the custom shells with a hypoallergenic bio-coating that reduces friction and protects against moisture. Each unit undergoes inspection and hand assembly, with technicians calibrating the drivers to match your ear canal shape. They even test each unit with binaural microphones and pressure sensors to verify the seal, making adjustments as needed to meet their comfort and performance standards.

The Zohn-1 combines custom-fit architecture with thoughtful material choices. The shells come in either medical-grade ceramic (offering premium weight and resonance) or biocompatible plastic (for lightweight comfort), with matte Black or gloss White finishes available. The custom fit eliminates acoustic leaks, enhancing bass response by 30% compared to generic earbuds while providing 26dB of passive noise isolation.
Inside, Knowles balanced armature drivers are positioned closer to the eardrum than in conventional designs. This placement enhances high-frequency sensitivity by 15% while reducing distortion. Unlike the dynamic drivers in most consumer earbuds, these BA drivers deliver more nuanced mids and highs.

The charging case is equally impressive—what de Buisonjé called “Lamborghini doors” open with a satisfying motion, secured by magnets. It supports both USB-C and wireless charging, providing up to 40 hours of additional battery life. Unlike most competitors, the battery is replaceable, extending the case’s lifespan as part of Breggz’s sustainability approach.

“We want something circular,” de Buisonjé explained. “If you put this in a shredder, we can build a new one. After the lifetime of this, we can reuse everything again.”
The modular design extends to the earbuds themselves. “We have what we call a faceplate that shuts it off. In the future, we’ll use magnets so you can take the faceplate off and take the pebble out. After two or three years when you want to change it, you just keep your shell. We say you don’t just buy a product, you invest in your ears.”
This “pebble” contains all the electronics and battery, while the custom shell houses only the drivers. Future upgrades won’t require a new custom fitting—just a new pebble with updated technology. The 3D-printed shells use recycled resins, and Breggz has established a repair program with DHL Express for global servicing.
The technical specs include Bluetooth 5.3 with LE Audio support, 8 hours of playback per charge, IPX4 water resistance, and six beamforming microphones with AI noise suppression.
After weeks of testing with audiophile-grade tracks, I’ve developed a good understanding of the Zohn-1’s sonic capabilities.
For detail retrieval, I tested “Wilderness” by Explosions In The Sky. This track presents a complex mix of guitars, drums, and atmospheric layers that the Zohn-1 handles with impressive clarity. The crash cymbals at 1:52 reveal textural details that typically get lost, while the bassline maintains definition without bleeding into other frequencies. Songs I’ve heard hundreds of times suddenly revealed hidden elements—subtle overdubs, production artifacts, mechanical sounds—that I’d never noticed before.
Vocal reproduction is equally impressive. “Helplessly Hoping” by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young presents intricate harmonies that the Zohn-1 renders with stunning clarity. Each voice occupies its own space while maintaining the cohesive blend that makes the harmonies compelling. Stephen Stills’ textured delivery contrasts with Graham Nash’s smoother tone, yet neither overshadows the other.
The Mimi personalization technology enhances this presentation. After completing my hearing test, the system made subtle adjustments to compensate for my specific hearing profile. These adjustments brought vocals forward naturally rather than artificially. The result is an intimate, lifelike vocal presentation that creates a stronger emotional connection to the music.
Bass performance shines on “Paper Trails” by Darkside, which features a sinuous bassline that demands both precision and power. The Zohn-1 delivers tight, controlled low frequencies with physical impact. Bass notes start and stop with exceptional accuracy, avoiding the bloated quality that plagues many wireless earbuds.
The custom-fit seal creates a significant advantage here. By eliminating air gaps between the driver and ear canal, the Zohn-1 achieves approximately 30% more low-frequency energy at the same volume level as universal earbuds. This allows for full, satisfying bass without excessive volume or distortion.
For treble testing, I used Pharoah Sanders’ “You’ve Got To Have Freedom,” which can sound harsh on many headphones. The Zohn-1 reproduces the saxophone’s upper harmonics with natural brilliance while avoiding the piercing quality that can make extended listening uncomfortable. The minute details of Sanders’ technique—breath sounds, key clicks, embouchure adjustments—are all present but integrated naturally into the performance.
Hans Zimmer’s “Time” from Inception demonstrated the Zohn-1’s spatial capabilities. With spatial audio engaged, the composition expands beyond the typical constraints of in-ear monitors. The ticking clock motif moves precisely through three-dimensional space while orchestral sections occupy distinct positions within a convincingly large soundstage.
The dynamic range is equally impressive. Kate Bush’s “Watching You Without Me” alternates between hushed vocal passages and dramatic synthesizer entries—contrasts that the Zohn-1 preserves beautifully. Bush’s quietest moments maintain their delicate intimacy, while the synthesizer bursts arrive with appropriate impact.
I also tested some nostalgic favorites. CC Catch’s “I Can Lose My Heart Tonight” displayed unexpected depth in its synthesizer arrangements. The Roland Jun-60 sounds exhibited authentic analog character, while CC’s vocals emerged with newfound clarity. Alan Walker’s “Faded” demonstrated the Zohn-1’s capabilities with contemporary electronic music. The drop at 1:12 delivered a physical impact and spatial expansion that created a genuinely immersive experience.
The Breggz companion app provides quick access to battery status, core settings, and personalization options. The Personal Sound feature uses Mimi Hearing Technologies to create a customized audio profile based on a 5-minute hearing test.
De Buisonjé explained: “We have a scanning app and a user app. In the app, we have an equalizer where you can five-way change the sound. In the future, we’ll have a parametric equalizer so you can do your own mix per song and save it.”
 The app includes customizable controls like Action Button setup and Head Moves, which enables nodding to skip tracks and shaking to decline calls. For communication, features like Smart Call clean up phone audio in noisy environments, while Fast Mute provides instant mic silencing. The Battery Prediction feature estimates playtime based on your usage habits, eliminating guesswork about whether the earbuds will last through a flight or a long session.

After several weeks with the Zohn-1, I’ve found both strengths and limitations worth noting:
Comfort for Extended Wear: The custom fit means I can wear these for 4-5 hours without fatigue or pressure points. My recent flights to and from Barcelona proved to be an excellent real-world test—I wore the Zohn-1s for nearly the entire journey both ways, and the comfort remained consistent. The combination of passive noise isolation and extended comfort made the typically draining flight experience remarkably pleasant. When I asked de Buisonjé about comfort during long sessions, he assured me that “it’s very comfortable… it’s not like it’s vacuumizing… it’s not going to get hotter or warmer in your ears.” After my travel experience, I can confirm that his assessment is accurate.

Battery Performance: The charging case provides approximately 20 hours of total playback time, with about 5 hours per charge in the earbuds themselves. This is respectable but not revolutionary compared to competitors at much lower price points.
Connectivity and Controls: The touch controls are responsive but require some learning. The companion app offers extensive customization, though I found myself wishing for physical buttons during workouts when touch controls became less reliable with perspiration.
Passive Noise Isolation: The custom fit creates exceptional passive noise isolation—better than many active noise cancellation systems I’ve tested. This makes them ideal for travel and noisy environments without requiring power-hungry ANC technology. As de Buisonjé explained, “We don’t have noise cancellation because everything is canceled already” through the perfect passive seal.
What sets the Zohn-1 apart is the personalization aspect. The Mimi technology adapts to your specific hearing profile through a 5-minute in-app test that maps hearing sensitivity across frequencies (500Hz to 8kHz). It then creates a personalized audio profile that compensates for your specific hearing characteristics.

This isn’t simply boosting overall volume in certain ranges—Mimi’s algorithm can adjust attenuated frequencies by up to 12dB while preserving dynamic range. The Knowles balanced armature drivers enable these precise adjustments due to their superior high-frequency response. The result is music that sounds more natural and balanced.
  
While the app does allow manual equalizer adjustments through its five-band EQ, it doesn’t offer saved presets for different genres or activities. The personalization comes primarily from the Mimi hearing technology, with manual EQ adjustments layering on top of this foundation.
De Buisonjé shared that this personalization approach is central to their target audience: “We focus really on the audio files and on the luxury buyer in the end. I don’t say any negative thing about the Hearables that are in the market now because Apple’s, they are great, Apple is a great company, come on, but we don’t want to compete with them and their mass products… We look to the high-end market.”
Since testing the Zohn-1, this is the question I’ve been asked most frequently. The answer isn’t straightforward.
For pure sound quality, the Zohn-1 delivers an experience that’s genuinely different from even high-end universal earbuds in the $300-500 range. The custom fit, driver placement, and personalization create a listening experience that’s uniquely tailored to your ears in a way that mass-produced products simply cannot match.
However, the value equation extends beyond just sound quality. The Zohn-1 represents a significant investment that most consumers will find difficult to justify. They’re clearly targeting audiophiles, professionals, and luxury consumers who prioritize personalized experiences and are willing to pay a premium for them.

To put the pricing in perspective, I own a pair of custom JH Audio JH18 in-ear monitors that cost over $3,000, and I still had to invest in a separate Bluetooth module costing more than $400 to make them wireless. When viewed through this lens, the Zohn-1’s $2,000 price tag for a fully integrated custom wireless solution with advanced personalization technology starts to look more reasonable within the high-end audio market. The fact that the Zohn-1 includes wireless connectivity, custom fitting, and hearing personalization in a single package represents a more streamlined approach compared to the piecemeal solutions many audiophiles have traditionally cobbled together.
De Buisonjé’s background as a performing artist for 30 years (doing 90-100 shows annually) influenced his vision for the product: “I’m on stage wearing wired in-ear monitors. And they get very good sound. So my simple thought was always, why isn’t this very good sound available for the consumer market? Because if you’re spending thousands of bucks in the studio with hot-shot producers, spending a lot of money to make the sound very special of your new single, you want to bring this exact sound to the audience.”
My experience with the Zohn-1 has convinced me that personalized audio is likely the next frontier for premium listening experiences. While the current $2,000 price point places these firmly in the luxury category, I expect we’ll see this technology become more accessible as manufacturing processes evolve.

Breggz already has plans for the future. De Buisonjé mentioned that “soon this year, already the Zohn-2 is coming” and hinted at future models with different driver configurations. He also mentioned plans for more customization options, including removable faceplates: “In the future, we have removable face plates. If you wear like a blue jacket, you can put a blue one on… And you can make like a piece of jewelry of it.”
The combination of anatomical custom fitting and software-based sound personalization creates a synergistic effect that elevates the listening experience beyond what either technology could achieve independently. As someone who’s tested countless audio products over the years, I can confidently say the Zohn-1 represents a genuinely new approach rather than an incremental improvement.
The Breggz Zohn-1 earbuds deliver on their promise of a revolutionary listening experience, though at a price point that limits their appeal to a niche market of audio enthusiasts and early adopters. The custom fit provides unmatched comfort and isolation while the personalized sound tuning creates a listening experience tailored specifically to your hearing profile.

Breggz has built something that feels personal from the inside out. The app functions as more than a control hub—it actively shapes the Zohn-1 to fit into daily life. The way the audio adapts to individual hearing and the flexibility in interaction reinforce the idea that this is not a one-size-fits-all experience. The Zohn-1 works seamlessly, adapting to preferences and becoming an essential part of how listening and communication happen throughout the day.
As de Buisonjé summarized his approach: “On every piece of the whole process, we just waited for the best. It took time. It took much more money than we thought it would take because if something wasn’t slightly perfect, we say, okay, if we want to aim for the high end markets, we need everything to be right.”
For those who can justify the investment, the Zohn-1 offers a glimpse into the future of personal audio—one where products are designed for your unique anatomy and hearing characteristics rather than a one-size-fits-most approach. While most consumers will understandably wait for this technology to become more affordable, my experience suggests that personalized audio represents a significant leap forward rather than just another incremental improvement in the crowded premium audio market.

Xiaomi Headphones Review Featured

Xiaomi is a long-time player in the wireless earbuds market, and the Buds 5 Pro are its latest flagship offering. As such, they bring a jam-packed set of features, including triple drivers, adaptive noise cancellation, aptX Lossless streaming, dual device pairing and head tracking, just to name a few.
We’ve already reviewed the semi in-ear Xiaomi Buds 5, which impressed us with its sound and rich feature set, and we are now turning our attention to their Pro counterpart.
The visual resemblance between the two Buds 5 models is striking. The obvious difference is that the Pro go for the traditional in-ear design with good old silicone tips. This addition plays a major role in the fit and seal around your ear canal, which was one pitfall on the regular Buds 5.
As you’d expect, the Pro moniker suggests a more capable device, which is the case here. Buds 5 Pro offer better sound, improved call quality and better battery life. So, is the higher asking price worth it? We’ve spent the last two weeks with the Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro and these are our findings.

Verdict

Design
Our Buds 5 Pro review unit comes in Titan Gray. This colorway was also available on the Buds 5, and it also features a highly reflective case lid that can double as a small pocket mirror. The bottom half of the case features a matte finish, which does a much better job of fending off fingerprints.

Buds 5 Pro gets a more rectangular-shaped charging case compared to the square one on the vanilla variant. The overall footprint is wider than the case on the Buds 5, though it’s still slim enough to slide into smaller pockets comfortably. The buds stay upright in the case, with the lid acting like a helmet visor.
Each earbud weighs 6.5 grams, with the case adding another 40 grams for a combined weight of 53 grams. Buds 5 Pro feature a nearly identical design to the Buds 5, with the only difference being the silicone tips that go in your ears. You still get the same pinch gesture pad at the bottom of each stem, which performed well enough in our testing period.

Jumping to the in-ear fit, we are delighted to say that the Buds 5 Pro deliver a great seal. They stay in place without wobbling, and the contoured shape of the speaker assembly is easy on the ear concha area even after longer listening sessions.
This reviewer spent over two weeks with the Buds 5 Pro as his main work and gym earbuds without any complaints in terms of comfort. The Buds 5 Pro stay in place even during runs and other fast-paced activities without any problem. Xiaomi also retained the IP54 dust and water resistance, meaning the Buds 5 Pro can handle sweat and light drops of rain without any hassle.
Features
Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro bring coaxial triple drivers with 11mm dynamic drivers, an additional planar driver and PZT tweeters. The buds also feature dual DACs and cover a frequency response range of 15Hz to 50kHz, which is wider than the Buds 5.

Buds 5 Pro pair over Bluetooth 5.4 and support Snapdragon Sound with aptX Lossless high-bitrate (48kHz/24bit) streaming at up to 2.1Mbps. They also get custom sound tuning from Harman’s Golden Ears team. Xiaomi is also offering a special edition of the Buds 5 Pro, which connect to newer Xiaomi phones via Wi-Fi for 96kHz/24-bit lossless audio and a bitrate up to 4.2Mbps. Sadly, our review unit offers Bluetooth-only connectivity.
As for noise cancellation, Buds 5 Pro are rated to drown out up to 55dB of noise thanks to the updated triple microphone system inside each earbud. Xiaomi also claims the Buds 5 Pro can pick up your voice in noisier environments at up to 100dB, thanks to its new AI noise reduction algorithm. The buds are also advertised to cancel out high wind speeds of up to 15m/s during calls. Newer Xiaomi phones also get HD calling for clearer-sounding calls.
Buds 5 Pro get the standard array features found on most earbuds of this class, like wear detection sensors, dual device pairing, and Google Fast Pair, all of which worked flawlessly in our testing across multiple phones and laptops.






Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro features inside the Xiaomi Earbuds app
Xiaomi's Earbuds app is your one-stop shop for tweaking all aspects of the Buds 5 Pro. You can assign single, double, and triple squeeze presses on the stems as well as a press and hold gesture. In terms of media playback, you get play/pause, next/previous song as well as volume controls via swipes. Xiaomi has perfected this squeeze control setup, though we’d still prefer single-tap controls instead of squeeze gestures.

The app home screen features toggles for the adaptive noise cancellation and ambient modes while the sound equalizer settings are buried under the Audio balance toggle.
Buds 5 Pro also support dimensional audio with head tracking, and the feature works regardless of your device’s operating system. We tested it on both an iPhone 15 Pro and Redmi Note 14 Pro+, as well as a 14” MacBook Pro, and it worked equally well. The feature did provide added immersion for movies, though we’d still consider it more of a gimmick than something we’d use on a regular basis.

Like the Buds 5, the 5 Pro also feature built-in audio recording functionality, which means you can use either of the buds as a dedicated voice recorder. This worked well enough in our time with the buds though you’ll have to export your recordings from the Xiaomi Earbuds app each time. You can also use the feature to record calls, and the Buds 5 Pro will play a warning message to inform the person on the other side.

Another new addition is the improved low latency mode, which now drops to 50ms when connected to a Xiaomi 14 series or newer phone via Bluetooth LE.
Sound quality
While bass was never a weak point on the non-Pro Buds 5, it is in another league on the Buds 5 Pro. That’s not to say that we’re dealing with V-shaped tuning here. The default soundstage on the Buds 5 Pro is favorably balanced between tonalities compared to most earbuds.
It exudes a punchier feeling, and you definitely feel more engaged when listening to music or watching videos compared to the Buds 5. Not only that, but the lows feel airier and more direct without overpowering the mids and highs.

The default sound profile is already pretty decently tuned, though a bit of EQ tweaking inside the Xiaomi Earphones app can bring out slightly more detail in the higher-end range.
We also have to mention the hardware advantage of the silicone ear tips, which can properly seal your ear canals. The improved seal also directly translates to superior sound quality and better noise cancellation. As expected, this is arguably the one area where the Buds 5 Pro holds its biggest advantage over the non-Pro model.

Without any media playback, the Pro model was able to keep lower-frequency noises at bay without any struggle, which was not the case on the Buds 5. Add in some tunes, and the ANC system takes care of the usual annoyances associated with public transport and overcrowded gyms.
There’s an adjustable transparency mode, which lets you toggle between regular mode, enhance voice and enhance ambient sound modes. This setup was similar to the Redmi Buds 6 Pro and the enhance sound mode was the best option out of the three.
The triple mics on the Buds 5 Pro did a great job during calls, which sounded great on my end and people on the other side reported clear reception of my voice. Stronger winds coupled with busier street noises proved challenging for the Buds 5 Pro, but they still managed a respectable job at picking up my voice.
Connectivity was stellar during our review period. We tested the Buds 5 Pro across Android, iOS and macOS with no limitation across all three and zero connectivity drops. The wear detection sensors worked as expected and the low latency mode delivered a noticeable improvement when connected to Xiaomi and Redmi phones.
Battery life
Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro feature 53mAh batteries inside the buds, while the case boasts a 570mAh battery. Xiaomi claims you can expect 8 hours of battery life on a single charge from the buds with ANC off, while the case extends total playtime to 40 hours.

In our testing period, we got slightly better results with 8 hours and 15 minutes from the buds with ANC off. If you turn ANC on and opt to stream via the aptX Lossless codec, the battery endurance takes a noticeable hit, and we only managed just over 6 hours of playtime.
Buds 5 Pro also feature a quick charge feature which gets you over 4 hours of playback from a 10-minute top-up. A full recharge of the buds and the case from 0-100% takes roughly 70 minutes via the USB-C port. You can also opt for wireless charging on any Qi wireless pad.
Verdict
The Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro are the best wireless earbuds from the brand to date. They offer excellent sound quality, support for high-bitrate streaming and a diverse feature set. The in-ear fit was great, and this alleviated our main gripe with the Buds 5. Battery life is noticeably better, though it's still not class-leading.
The onboard voice recorder is a nice touch, and we also enjoyed the expansive of features inside the Xiaomi Earphones app. Call quality is noticeably improved over the Buds 5 and wireless charging on the charging case is another overdue addition.

At €200 for the Bluetooth version and €220 for the version with Qualcomm XPAN Wi-Fi connectivity, the Buds 5 Pro are not cheap. You could easily opt for the Redmi 6 Pro, which bring nearly identical set of features at a much lower price point.
We’d prefer single-tap control gestures instead of the squeeze implementation found here but other than that we don’t have other gripes. If you’re in the Xiaomi ecosystem, then the Buds 5 Pro are an easy recommendation that brings the best of the brand’s audio ambitions.

We tested it on both an iPhone 15 Pro and Redmi Note 14 Pro+, as well as a 14” MacBook Pro, and it worked equally well. The feature did provide added immersion for movies, though we’d still consider it more of a gimmick than something we’d use on a regular basis.

Like the Buds 5, the 5 Pro also feature built-in audio recording functionality, which means you can use either of the buds as a dedicated voice recorder. This worked well enough in our time with the buds though you’ll have to export your recordings from the Xiaomi Earbuds app each time. You can also use the feature to record calls, and the Buds 5 Pro will play a warning message to inform the person on the other side.

Another new addition is the improved low latency mode, which now drops to 50ms when connected to a Xiaomi 14 series or newer phone via Bluetooth LE.
Sound quality
While bass was never a weak point on the non-Pro Buds 5, it is in another league on the Buds 5 Pro. That’s not to say that we’re dealing with V-shaped tuning here. The default soundstage on the Buds 5 Pro is favorably balanced between tonalities compared to most earbuds.
It exudes a punchier feeling, and you definitely feel more engaged when listening to music or watching videos compared to the Buds 5. Not only that, but the lows feel airier and more direct without overpowering the mids and highs.

The default sound profile is already pretty decently tuned, though a bit of EQ tweaking inside the Xiaomi Earphones app can bring out slightly more detail in the higher-end range.
We also have to mention the hardware advantage of the silicone ear tips, which can properly seal your ear canals. The improved seal also directly translates to superior sound quality and better noise cancellation. As expected, this is arguably the one area where the Buds 5 Pro holds its biggest advantage over the non-Pro model.

Without any media playback, the Pro model was able to keep lower-frequency noises at bay without any struggle, which was not the case on the Buds 5. Add in some tunes, and the ANC system takes care of the usual annoyances associated with public transport and overcrowded gyms.
There’s an adjustable transparency mode, which lets you toggle between regular mode, enhance voice and enhance ambient sound modes. This setup was similar to the Redmi Buds 6 Pro and the enhance sound mode was the best option out of the three.
The triple mics on the Buds 5 Pro did a great job during calls, which sounded great on my end and people on the other side reported clear reception of my voice. Stronger winds coupled with busier street noises proved challenging for the Buds 5 Pro, but they still managed a respectable job at picking up my voice.
Connectivity was stellar during our review period. We tested the Buds 5 Pro across Android, iOS and macOS with no limitation across all three and zero connectivity drops. The wear detection sensors worked as expected and the low latency mode delivered a noticeable improvement when connected to Xiaomi and Redmi phones.
Battery life
Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro feature 53mAh batteries inside the buds, while the case boasts a 570mAh battery. Xiaomi claims you can expect 8 hours of battery life on a single charge from the buds with ANC off, while the case extends total playtime to 40 hours.

In our testing period, we got slightly better results with 8 hours and 15 minutes from the buds with ANC off. If you turn ANC on and opt to stream via the aptX Lossless codec, the battery endurance takes a noticeable hit, and we only managed just over 6 hours of playtime.
Buds 5 Pro also feature a quick charge feature which gets you over 4 hours of playback from a 10-minute top-up. A full recharge of the buds and the case from 0-100% takes roughly 70 minutes via the USB-C port. You can also opt for wireless charging on any Qi wireless pad.
Verdict
The Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro are the best wireless earbuds from the brand to date. They offer excellent sound quality, support for high-bitrate streaming and a diverse feature set. The in-ear fit was great, and this alleviated our main gripe with the Buds 5. Battery life is noticeably better, though it's still not class-leading.
The onboard voice recorder is a nice touch, and we also enjoyed the expansive of features inside the Xiaomi Earphones app. Call quality is noticeably improved over the Buds 5 and wireless charging on the charging case is another overdue addition.

At €200 for the Bluetooth version and €220 for the version with Qualcomm XPAN Wi-Fi connectivity, the Buds 5 Pro are not cheap. You could easily opt for the Redmi 6 Pro, which bring nearly identical set of features at a much lower price point.
We’d prefer single-tap control gestures instead of the squeeze implementation found here but other than that we don’t have other gripes. If you’re in the Xiaomi ecosystem, then the Buds 5 Pro are an easy recommendation that brings the best of the brand’s audio ambitions.

Our Buds 5 Pro review unit comes in Titan Gray. This colorway was also available on the Buds 5, and it also features a highly reflective case lid that can double as a small pocket mirror. The bottom half of the case features a matte finish, which does a much better job of fending off fingerprints.
Buds 5 Pro gets a more rectangular-shaped charging case compared to the square one on the vanilla variant. The overall footprint is wider than the case on the Buds 5, though it’s still slim enough to slide into smaller pockets comfortably. The buds stay upright in the case, with the lid acting like a helmet visor.
Each earbud weighs 6.5 grams, with the case adding another 40 grams for a combined weight of 53 grams. Buds 5 Pro feature a nearly identical design to the Buds 5, with the only difference being the silicone tips that go in your ears. You still get the same pinch gesture pad at the bottom of each stem, which performed well enough in our testing period.
Jumping to the in-ear fit, we are delighted to say that the Buds 5 Pro deliver a great seal. They stay in place without wobbling, and the contoured shape of the speaker assembly is easy on the ear concha area even after longer listening sessions.
This reviewer spent over two weeks with the Buds 5 Pro as his main work and gym earbuds without any complaints in terms of comfort. The Buds 5 Pro stay in place even during runs and other fast-paced activities without any problem. Xiaomi also retained the IP54 dust and water resistance, meaning the Buds 5 Pro can handle sweat and light drops of rain without any hassle.
Features
Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro bring coaxial triple drivers with 11mm dynamic drivers, an additional planar driver and PZT tweeters. The buds also feature dual DACs and cover a frequency response range of 15Hz to 50kHz, which is wider than the Buds 5.

Buds 5 Pro pair over Bluetooth 5.4 and support Snapdragon Sound with aptX Lossless high-bitrate (48kHz/24bit) streaming at up to 2.1Mbps. They also get custom sound tuning from Harman’s Golden Ears team. Xiaomi is also offering a special edition of the Buds 5 Pro, which connect to newer Xiaomi phones via Wi-Fi for 96kHz/24-bit lossless audio and a bitrate up to 4.2Mbps. Sadly, our review unit offers Bluetooth-only connectivity.
As for noise cancellation, Buds 5 Pro are rated to drown out up to 55dB of noise thanks to the updated triple microphone system inside each earbud. Xiaomi also claims the Buds 5 Pro can pick up your voice in noisier environments at up to 100dB, thanks to its new AI noise reduction algorithm. The buds are also advertised to cancel out high wind speeds of up to 15m/s during calls. Newer Xiaomi phones also get HD calling for clearer-sounding calls.
Buds 5 Pro get the standard array features found on most earbuds of this class, like wear detection sensors, dual device pairing, and Google Fast Pair, all of which worked flawlessly in our testing across multiple phones and laptops.






Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro features inside the Xiaomi Earbuds app
Xiaomi's Earbuds app is your one-stop shop for tweaking all aspects of the Buds 5 Pro. You can assign single, double, and triple squeeze presses on the stems as well as a press and hold gesture. In terms of media playback, you get play/pause, next/previous song as well as volume controls via swipes. Xiaomi has perfected this squeeze control setup, though we’d still prefer single-tap controls instead of squeeze gestures.

Very good nice
It's what you wanted to see and wanted to understand. Even when you dont think so. Is that how it goes ?
You were commenting that on an article about in-ears. Sorry dude but you made an indirect and useless comparison, even if you don't see it.

55,2025-03-09,"A week after tariff implementation and subsequent relief, investors can look forward to a relatively quieter week — at least when it comes to earnings. However, upcoming inflation data could still stir the markets, as it may guide the Federal Reserve’s strategy on the timing and scale of potential interest rate cuts.
Here’s what investors should watch for this week:
This week promises to be relatively quiet on the earnings front, with only a handful of notable companies scheduled to report.
On Monday, Oracle (ORCL+2.37%) will kick things off, releasing its earnings after the market closes. The software giant’s performance will be closely watched for insights into its enterprise technology spending and cloud growth.
Tuesday morning will bring Kohl’s (KSS+3.96%) quarterly results, offering a glimpse into the health of the retail sector.
Adobe (ADBE-0.28%) is set to announce its earnings on Wednesday after the closing bell. Investors will be looking for updates on its subscription growth and the impact of its AI initiatives on the business.
Rounding out the week, Ulta Beauty (ULTA+0.22%) will report its financials on Thursday. With its reputation as a retail standout, Ulta’s results could provide valuable signals on beauty-industry trends and consumer demand.
The job openings report for January will be released on Tuesday morning. 
On Wednesday, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and core CPI data will be published, shedding light on inflationary trends and the cost of living. 
On Thursday, the Producer Price Index (PPI) and core PPI data will be released. The PPI measures inflation at the wholesale level and provides an early indicator of potential price pressures in the broader economy. Additionally, the weekly initial jobless claims data will be released, providing a glimpse into the health of the labor market.
Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

59,2025-03-09,"This 1999 Mercedes-Benz C43 AMG is one of a reported 772 Japanese-market station wagon examples, and it has 141k kilometers (~87k miles). It was imported to Canada in 2014 and is powered by a 4.3-liter V8 mated to a five-speed automatic transmission. Finished in Brilliant Silver Metallic over Exclusive Anthracite leather upholstery, the car features AMG-specific bumper covers and side skirts as well as 17″ AMG monoblock wheels, a glass sunroof, headlight wipers, power-adjustable heated front seats, retractable rear seat headrests, a Bose sound system, cruise control, and automatic climate control. This W202 was acquired by the current owner in 2014 and is now offered on their behalf with British Columbia registration in the name of the owner’s LLC.

This example is finished in Brilliant Silver Metallic (744) and features AMG-specific bumper covers and side skirts. Additional equipment includes fog lights, a glass sunroof, headlight wipers, heated side mirrors, tinted rear windows, and dual round exhaust outlets. The vehicle shows evidence of a repaint under prior ownership.

The 17″ AMG monoblock alloy wheels are mounted with Bridgestone tires measuring 225/45 up front and 245/40 out back. The car features an independent double-wishbone front and multi-link rear suspension, and stopping power is provided by four-wheel disc brakes.

The cabin features heated and power-adjustable multi-contour front seats upholstered in Exclusive Anthracite leather, and burl wood trim accents the dash, center console, and door panels. Equipment includes retractable rear seat headrests, cruise control, automatic climate control, power windows and mirrors, and a Bose sound system.

The leather-wrapped four-spoke steering wheel is mounted to an adjustable steering column and frames an AMG-branded instrument cluster, including a 160-mph speedometer, a 7k-rpm tachometer, and gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 141k kilometers (~87k miles), approximately 4k kilometers of which have been added under current ownership.

The 4.3-liter M113 V8 was factory rated at 302 horsepower and 302 lb-ft of torque. Work under current ownership included replacing the spark plugs and performing fluid services.

Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed automatic transmission.

62,2025-03-09,"Meta and CEO Mark Zuckerberg have been in their “free speech” arc since Donald Trump took office again, but a new account offered by a whistleblower throws cold water on the idea that the company won’t comply with censorship regimes. According to a report from the Washington Post, a whistleblower complaint alleges that Facebook built a content censorship system that complied with the wishes of the Chinese Communist Party in a failed attempt to operate within China.
The 78-page complaint was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by Sarah Wynn-Williams, a former global policy director who worked on a team handling China policy and left the company in 2017. According to Wynn-Williams’ account, which was obtained by WaPo, Facebook was started trying to crack the Chinese market back in 2014, and was willing to make major concessions to the country’s ruling party in order to gain access to the potentially massive userbase.
Throughout its courtship with China, Facebook and Zuckerberg reportedly agreed to play ball in a number of ways that undermined its standard operating procedure. That included, per Wynn-Williams, agreeing to host Chinese user data on servers in China, including users in Hong Kong, who had previously received stronger protections. According to the whistleblower, that concession would have made it easier for the Chinese government to access the personal information of its citizens.
Wynn-Williams claims that talks of Facebook operating in China started to heat up in 2015, which is when Facebook allegedly built a censorship system that would automatically detect and remove content that contained restricted terms. The whistleblower report also claims Facebook was willing to install a “chief editor” who would oversee the content that could appear on the Chinese version of the social platform. That editor could remove content as they saw fit and allegedly would have the power to shut off the site entirely if the country experienced “social unrest.”
Facebook’s courtship of China reportedly continued throughout 2017, when the company restricted the account of Chinese businessman Guo Wengui, who had been critical of the Chinese government. Wengui was living in New York at the time, exiled from China, and regularly posted about alleged corruption within the Chinese government on Facebook. At the time, Facebook claimed it was removing his account because he was sharing “personal information of others without their consent.” But, per the whistleblower report, the removal was encouraged by one of China’s internet regulators as a way to prove the company was willing to âaddress mutual interests.â
The efforts, it seems, were largely for naught. Facebook did covertly launch social apps in China at one point, but its big hitters never made the leap. In fact, WhatsApp got banned in the country in 2017, just a couple years after Facebook bought it, despite the ongoing attempt by the company to comply with China’s wishes.
Meta, for its part, refutes the whistleblower report. âThis is all pushed by an employee terminated eight years ago for poor performance. We do not operate our services in China today. It is no secret we were once interested in doing so as part of Facebookâs effort to connect the world. This was widely reported beginning a decade ago. We ultimately opted not to go through with the ideas we’d explored, which Mark Zuckerberg announced in 2019,” a Meta spokesperson said.
Once it was clear that China was no longer in play for Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg decided freedom of speech really mattered to him. In 2019, he spoke at Georgetown and claimed his company stood for free expression, specifically taking shots at China’s closed internet approach. He did not mention all the acquiescing he was reportedly willing to do if his company was just allowed to do business behind those walls.
Zuck has used that “free expression” line repeatedly in last half-decade, leaning on it again when he decided to ditch third-party fact-checkers and roll back content moderation following Trump’s ascendance to a second term as President, and really playing it up during an appearance on Joe Rogan where he talked about how awful the Biden administration was to his company and their passion for free expression that sometimes looks a lot like misinformation.
Fittingly, Zuckerberg now pushing for the Trump administration to ban TikTok, an app with ties to China, from operating in America. If you can’t profit from not having any principles, I guess your next-best option is to try to profit by faking them. Don’t bother actually having any, though, that’s not going to help the bottom line.

63,2025-03-09,"Ten years ago today, Apple unveiled the 12-inch MacBook to the world, claiming it had “reinvented the notebook” for the better. The laptop almost instantly divided opinion, with fans and detractors at each other’s throats from the start. And sure, it was by no means perfect, but look a little closer and I think you’ll find a device that has had a monumental impact on the world of computing — not just on Apple, but on the industry as a whole.
The 12-inch MacBook is often seen as a flop and as a product emblematic of the excesses of Apple’s Jony Ive era, where the design guru’s penchant for thinness and lightness ruled all. The fact that this MacBook was discontinued after just four years is seen as proof of this idea.
Yet I see it as something else: a precursor to many of the class-leading features that Apple fans enjoy today. Sure, it was deeply flawed, underpowered and overpriced. But it was also way ahead of its time and brilliant in so many ways. Ultimately, we probably wouldn’t have many of the features we see in the best MacBooks today were it not for the 12-inch MacBook.
When the 12-inch MacBook launched, it attracted attention for many of the wrong reasons. For one thing, it was expensive, with its $1,299 price tag on a par with the MacBook Pro. That alone made it tough to swallow, but when you realized you were only getting an Intel Core M chip for your money — a chip that was designed for mobile devices rather than high-powered laptops — it really stuck in the craw.
As well as that, the 12-inch MacBook introduced the now-infamous butterfly keyboard, which was uncomfortable and prone to failure. Apple spent years trying to fix and refine this keyboard before giving up entirely. And then there was the gold color — the first time we’d seen this in a MacBook — which just felt plain pretentious.
Yet at the same time, this laptop packed in some incredible features not found anywhere else. It was amazingly thin and light for a laptop, drawing comparisons to when the original MacBook Air was unveiled in 2008 to shocked audience reactions. Ironically, the 12-inch MacBook threatened to cannibalize the MacBook Air, as the former was now far more slimline and portable than the Air.
The 12-inch MacBook also introduced the large Force Touch trackpad, an ingenious feature that is beloved to this day and has inspired copycats across the industry. And while it might not have been the first Mac with a Retina display, it still got this before the MacBook Air, showing that even portable notebooks could come with fantastic screens.
There’s more. Not only did Apple pack in an innovative battery design that helped it last all day despite its super-thin chassis, but it even managed to go without an internal fan, giving you the kind of silent operation that wouldn’t be seen again until 2020’s Apple silicon MacBook Air.
And then there was the single USB-C port, which the 12-inch MacBook was the first to offer in Apple’s laptop range. At the time, the move was mocked for ushering in the ubiquitous “dongle,” but it also helped spur the industry on to adopt USB-C far more widely. Now, it’s everywhere you look. In a way, it was reminiscent of when the iMac G3 dropped the floppy drive. No one misses those disks now.
It’s easy to remember the worst elements of the 12-inch MacBook. Don’t get me wrong, I was absolutely not a fan when it launched, and I know I’m not alone there.
But armed with a few years of hindsight and the knowledge of what the device went on to inspire, I think it’s worth reappraising the 12-inch MacBook. While its failures were many, it also helped introduce numerous class-leading features that you can find today in Apple’s MacBook lineup.
The way I see the 12-inch MacBook is that, like the equally notorious Apple Newton, it was a good idea done too soon. It was ahead of its time and wasn’t able to deliver on the promises it made, and while not all of its features were on the money, many of them were. Indeed, the ideas it embodied have driven Apple devices forward, and plenty of them have been widely adopted across the market.
The 12-inch MacBook may have failed, but Apple returned to the idea of a fanless, lightweight laptop driven by a highly efficient chip a few years down the road in the form of 2020’s Apple silicon MacBook Air. Some of the 12-inch MacBook’s best concepts are still alive today, even if the device itself has been consigned to the history. And that’s got to be worth something.
With the introduction of the new M4 MacBook Air, it's time to say goodbye to some of the older models. This time, both the M3 and the M2 MacBook Air will disappear from Apple Store shelves. Unlike the M3, however, the M2 isn't being discontinued completely -- it will still be available at certain retailers.
This gives people a chance to get an amazing laptop (the laptop I'm writing on right now) at a really good price. TechRadar has already spotted certain M2 MacBook Air configurations on Amazon selling for as low as $699. That's 30% off MSRP and 30% less than the new M4 model.
Apple has just launched a new MacBook Air equipped with its M4 chip, bringing improved performance and efficiency to one of the company’s best MacBooks. The long-rumored update means that all of Apple’s laptops now come with the M4 chip.
As expected, the M4 MacBook Air is more of an evolution than a revolution. The M4 chip means a slight improvement in terms of performance compared to the previous M3 version, but there are few changes elsewhere. According to Apple, the M4 MacBook Air can perform tasks like video editing and photo editing up to 2x faster than its M1 counterpart -- so upgrading could be worth it for M1 owners.
Apple may soon release a new Mac Studio along with the new MacBook Airs, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman on X. This could set it apart from the Mac Pro, which is expected to skip M3 Ultra and jump straight to M4 Ultra.
Gurman stated, “It’s not an ‘Air’ — but the new Mac Studio, codenamed J575, appears to be imminent. It could be announced as early as this week along with the new MacBook Airs. There are signs these will come with an M4 Max but that its new Ultra chip will actually be an M3 Ultra.”

Bitcoin via a Spot ETF is an exciting asset to add to one's portfolio.
Bitcoin Spot ETFs have emerged as a leading way for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin, the world’s leading cryptocurrency, which has delivered tremendous returns since its launch in 2009. In 2024, the SEC approved bitcoin ETFs like IBIT and FBTC allowing retail and institutional investors to invest in the cryptocurrency on stock exchanges alongside other assets like the best stocks for 2025.
In this article, you’ll learn the key differences between the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), how they compare in terms of fees, performance, management and security. While these bitcoin ETFs may not be right for some investors like the risk-averse or those who wish to hold bitcoin directly, they can provide exposure to an exciting asset which is rapidly gaining mainstream adoption.
Investors may wish to invest in bitcoin in the first place, because of its strong performance, returning 47,116.2%% over the last 10 years and 997.9%% over the last 5 years. Depending on who you ask, bitcoin can serve as a promising speculative asset, an alternative store of value to the fiat currency like gold or a currency as it can serve as a means of exchange. A bitcoin ETF is most suitable for investors who wish to gain exposure to bitcoin as a speculative asset, earning a potential return from the asset’s growth.
Bitcoin Spot ETFs like IBIT and FBTC allow investors to invest in bitcoin’s price movements through traditional brokerage accounts without needing to store bitcoin assets themselves. These ETFs provide liquidity, regulatory oversight, and simple trading alongside stocks, bonds and other funds in your portfolio.
For investors who only wish to invest in bitcoin and not in other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum or Solana from their existing brokerage account, bitcoin ETFs like IBIT and FBTC are a good solution, rather than a cryptocurrency exchange like Coinbase.
IBIT and FBTC both track the price movements of bitcoin but with differences in fees, how they’re structured, and their providers. Both of these bitcoin ETFs trade on the major stock exchanges like NYSE, allowing broad access to retail investors and institutional investors.
IBIT is a bitcoin ETF managed by BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world with $11.6 trillion under management. This ETF provides direct exposure to bitcoin price movements by holding bitcoin against its shares. BlackRock has a strong reputation of successful fund management with many established relationships across the global financial world, lending credibility to its bitcoin ETF.
FBTC is a bitcoin ETF managed by Fidelity, another major asset manager with $5.8 trillion under management. Like IBIT, FBTC directly holds bitcoin against its shares, ensuring close price tracking of bitcoin. Fidelity is a commonly used asset manager by retail investors while BlackRock attracts more institutional investors. Fidelity has a long track record of engagement with cryptocurrency tracing back to 2014 when the firm began researching digital assets like bitcoin and blockchain technology.
Both IBIT and FBTC closely track the price of bitcoin as they hold bitcoin against shares. FBTC’s 1-year return slightly outperformed IBIT with FBTC returning 137.65% vs 137.32% but investors will likely earn comparable returns going forward. Future performance is dependent on the price movements of bitcoin and effective custody of bitcoin for both ETFs by their managers.
Both IBIT and FBTC hold bitcoin against their shares and closely track the price movements of bitcoin. The core holdings of IBIT and FBTC are identical as both are entirely invested in bitcoin. Slight differences may emerge based on fund management and liquidity.
Bitcoin is not an income generating asset like a bond or dividend-earning stock and neither IBIT or FBTC offer dividend yield to investors. Bitcoin ETFs like IBIT and FBTC are best suited to investors who wish to gain a return from capital appreciation rather than dividend yield.
Bitcoin is a speculative asset which can experience wild swings in price that retail investors may not be used to from traditional investing. For example, in February 2025, bitcoin experienced a 17% drop in value, followed by a 10% rally in March spurred on by speculation regarding a U.S. strategic cryptocurrency reserve. If the U.S. government invested in bitcoin through a strategic reserve, it would further shore up institutional adoption of the asset.
The launch of bitcoin ETFs like IBIT and FBTC in 2024 increased adoption of bitcoin by allowing retail and institutional investors to more easily invest in the cryptocurrency alongside major assets like the best ETFs on exchanges. Public companies can also add bitcoin to their balance sheet as Microstrategy notably has as well as asset managers who wish to add bitcoin to their portfolio. With increased regulatory clarity by the SEC, more investors may feel comfortable investing in bitcoin, increasing its market cap and price.
As mentioned, bitcoin is a volatile asset and both IBIT and FBTC can swing in price based on breaking news or market sentiment. Although regulatory clarity regarding bitcoin seems to be increasing, there is always the risk of adverse regulatory decisions affecting the price or availability of the asset in different markets. A risk which could potentially affect an ETF like IBIT or FBTC is a custody issue of bitcoin, like a hack or mismanagement of assets.
As with any investment, investors should weigh their risk tolerance before investing in a bitcoin ETF like IBIT or FBTC. A good rule of thumb for bitcoin ETFs and bitcoin generally is to not invest an amount you would lose sleep over losing the entirety of.
Bitcoin ETFs are subject to both short and long-term capital gains tax just like direct holding of bitcoin. One difference from a tax perspective is that bitcoin ETFs can be easily invested in through a traditional or Roth IRA, unlike direct holding of bitcoin. This can increase the tax efficiency of bitcoin investment as you may be able to defer taxes on bitcoin gains with a traditional IRA or not pay tax on these gains at all with a Roth IRA.
You should consult with a tax professional with cryptocurrency expertise if you’re concerned with the tax implications of investing in bitcoin ETFs.
While IBIT and FBTC offer comparable bitcoin Spot ETFs, these ETFs differ based on expense ratios, asset manager strengths, and custody strategies.
IBIT may be better suited for investors who wish to track the price movements of bitcoin with a lower expense ratio of 0.12%, all managed by the largest asset manager in the world with strong institutional support. FBTC may be preferred by investors who don’t mind a slightly higher expense ratio in exchange for Fidelity’s self-custody model and a decade-long track record of cryptocurrency expertise.
Investors should further research both firm’s security protocols for custody as well as considering alternative bitcoin Spot ETFs and holding cryptocurrency directly as an alternative.
Bottom Line
IBIT and FBTC are very similar ETFs. They track the same asset and both are effective means for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin at low expense ratios from established asset managers. The ultimate decision of which ETF to choose for your portfolio comes down to reputation, minor expense ratio and performance differences, and the approach by which each firm custodies their bitcoin.
Bitcoin via a Spot ETF is an exciting asset to add to one's portfolio. Rapid spikes and falls in price are an inevitability but since its inception, it has outperformed major indexes like the S&P 500. The launch of IBIT and FBTC through BlackRock and Fidelity respectively demonstrates mainstream interest and adoption by the financial services, providing the possibility for stellar returns to a greater number of investors."

Save $100 on Apple's newest smartwatch.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Apple last week got the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to uphold its win in a patent battle with AliveCor that could have blocked Apple Watch imports. Perhaps retailers now think they'll have plenty of stock, because Best Buy and Amazon have just slashed $100 off the prices of the latest model, the Apple Watch Series 10, meaning it's now just $299 for the base GPS model.
These are the lowest Apple Watch Series 10 prices we've ever seen. The smartwatch was released in September. It has a larger, brighter display than previous generations, faster charging, up to 18 hours of battery life as standard and up to 36 hours in Low Power Mode (see our full guide to the Apple Watch generations).
There are also some great deals about on the cheaper Apple Watch SE. See full details below.
Save $100: This is the lowest price on record for the the Apple Watch Series 10, representing a saving of 25% on Apple's latest model, which was released last September. The Series 10 has a bright OLED always-on display, temperature sensor and health metrics plus the handy double-tap gesture for quicker frequent actions.
The price above is for the GPS version with a 42mm screen, but there are offers on the 46mm version too, which now costs $329.
Price check: Amazon: also $299 | Apple: $399
UK price: £399 £382 at Amazon
Save $80: Meanwhile, the Apple Watch SE 2nd gen is also on sale, and it's close to the record low price of £149. This is the ideal smartwatch for anyone on a tighter budget. It doesn't have as bright a screen or an always-on display, nor the double-tap feature, but it still provides phone and music access and a range of health stats. This price is for the GPS 40mm version but there are similar deals on other configurations too. 
Price check: $169 at Best Buy | $249 at Apple

Jamien Sherwood has become the latest to stay with his former team as Adam Schefter of ESPN reports that the linebacker has agreed to a three-year, $45 million deal with $30 million fully guaranteed.
Kansas City’s Nick Bolton, Philadelphia’s Zack Baun, Washington’s Bobby Wagner, Seattle’s Ernest Jones and Tampa Bay’s Lavonte David are other linebackers who have opted not to hit free agency this week.

79,2025-03-09,"The Ukrainian military launched two HIMARS rockets directly at a local market in Russia’s Kherson Region on Sunday, according to regional governor Vladimir Saldo. The attack on the town of Veliky Kopani left several civilians dead and “a lot” wounded, Saldo said, citing preliminary data.
Dozens of civilians were at the market when at least two projectiles fired from a US-supplied M142 HIMARS multiple rocket launcher struck the location, according to a Telegram post by Saldo, which included images from the aftermath. The photos show one building badly damaged, with thick smoke billowing from it.
Footage circulating online shows a destroyed van ablaze outside of the market, with an injured – or possibly dead – person lying next to it.
A paramedic and driver with the local emergency medical services were also injured in the attack, the regional health minister, Elena Borchaninova, told TASS. At least seven civilians were injured in the attack with one subsequently succumbing to his injuries, the ministry’s press service told the news agency.
The exact number of casualties has not yet been officially established, as the wounded are still being transferred to hospitals. At least some of the victims were sent to the coastal city of Skadovsk, located some 20 km to the south of Veliky Kopani.
“The information is still preliminary. We are waiting for all the victims. They have been sent to the Skadovsk hospital. So far, only two have been brought in. Unfortunately, one of the two has died,” the Health Ministry told RIA Novosti.
Kiev has been receiving M142 HIMARS and its heavier tracked cousin, the M270 MLRS, since mid-2022 from the US and other Western backers. The systems, once touted as a key tool for striking high-value Russian assets, have routinely been used by Kiev for indiscriminate strikes on civilian targets deep beyond the frontline.

    Your kidney health is linked to what you eat. Focus on these foods for a boost in function.
  
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that over 1 in 7 US adults has chronic kidney disease. This can cause excess waste and fluid to build up in the body, leading to health problems like heart disease, increased infections, depression, anemia and loss of appetite. The kidneys are essential for overall health. 
To give your kidneys some love, there are foods you can add to your diet in the name of kidney health. Below, we outline 13 superfoods to eat, many of which you may already have in your fridge or pantry.
Fish delivers protein, and when you choose a fatty fish like tuna, salmon or trout, you're also getting omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fats may help reduce fat levels (triglycerides) in the blood and may also lower blood pressure, according to the National Kidney Foundation.
If you have CKD, you may need to keep an eye on the phosphorus and potassium levels of the fish you choose. The National Kidney Foundation has a chart you can use to determine levels in specific types of fish. Although, it's best to consult with your doctor.
This nutrient-dense vegetable is low in both potassium and sodium while packing in fiber, vitamins C and K and more.
Plus, cabbage is versatile. You can use it in salads and slaws, but you can also use it as a wrap for tacos, sandwiches and more.
Like cabbage, bell peppers pack in lots of good nutrients with low levels of potassium. With them, you get vitamins B6, B9, C and K, plus fiber. They deliver antioxidants too.
You can slice them and eat them with dips or roast them and add them to dinner.
Cranberries help to prevent urinary tract infections. These usually stay in your bladder, they can travel up to your kidney, making kidney problems worse. Fortunately, regularly consuming cranberries can help you avoid this unwelcome situation.
Plus, cranberries have antioxidants that can help fight inflammation, and they can boost your heart and digestive health. It turns out, these tart berries aren't just for the Thanksgiving table.
We've talked about some of the best foods for kidneys, but you can take it a step further. The question is: What foods help repair kidneys? Blueberries deliver.
With high levels of antioxidants and loads of vitamin C and fiber, blueberries are all-around healthy. They can also help to reduce inflammation and support bone health, reversing some of the issues that can come with CKD.
There are plenty of reasons to turn to dark, leafy greens like spinach or kale. They deliver so many nutrients that they can help you get key vitamins and minerals, plus immunity-boosting benefits.
Be advised that greens can come with a decent amount of potassium. If you have CKD, talk to your doctor before adding more of these to your diet.
Rich in antioxidants and healthy fatty acids, olive oil can boost your overall wellness. A study from Harvard University found that olive oil may lower cholesterol levels and the risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia and some types of cancer.
Beyond all this, it can help you add flavor to dishes without turning to salt or butter. To get more antioxidants, choose unrefined or cold-pressed olive oil that's virgin or extra virgin.
Another antioxidant-rich, inflammation-fighting food, garlic also contains a specific compound called allicin. For people with CKD, allicin — an active compound found in garlic — worked just as effectively to help protect kidney health as a prescription drug. If you're looking for the best foods for your kidneys, garlic has to make the list.
Plus, it's an excellent way to add flavor when you're skimping on salt.
From the same family as garlic, onions give you another excellent and salt-free way to add flavor (bonus points if you saute them in olive oil). Onions also deliver important nutrients like vitamins B6 and C, manganese and copper.
They also contain quercetin, a chemical that can help your body fight cancer, and organic sulfur compounds that can reduce your risk of high blood pressure, stroke and heart disease.
Cauliflower brings the crunch, paired with plenty of vitamins C, B6, B9 and K, along with fiber. It also contains compounds your body can use to neutralize certain toxins, a big help when your kidneys aren't doing their best filtration work.
Cauliflower does contain some potassium and phosphorus, though, so while it makes the list of foods good for kidneys, people with CKD may want to moderate their intake.

Saturday Night Live‘s Donald Trump tried to resolve tensions between Elon Musk and Marco Rubio, while using the opportunity to insult them both. 

	Trump (James Austin Johnson) first summoned Secretary of State Rubio (Marcello Hernandez) to the Oval Office, where he told the former Florida senator that he’s been doing great in his new role.

	“You’re the GOAT,” he said. “You’re the scapegoat. But it’s still a type of goat.” 

	During his at-times misleading speech to Congress Tuesday night, Trump said–perhaps jokingly–that Rubio would be to blame if the U.S. wasn’t able to reacquire the Panama Canal.

	Later, Trump called in Musk (Mike Myers), the head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency.

	“Now look, I can’t have you two at each other’s throats, okay? After all, I have a perfect record. Everyone who’s ever worked for me has left on good terms–and then gone on to write a book called, The Man Who Ruined Everything,” he said. “So you two need to start acting like mature adults, okay? So let’s begin with Marco.” 

	










	Musk blurted out: “Polo!”

	Trump would go on the recommend that any insults should actually be good. 

	“Something like: ‘Elon, how do you have 20 kids but I’ve never seen you with a chick? Just dudes named donkey dong and boner king.’ You know, stuff like that.”

	“Watch this,” he then said, turning to Rubio. “Marco: Short and gay. Classic.”As Trump explained to Musk why Rubio is “important,” Musk’s thoughts were revealed.

	“Phase one of my plan is complete: Ingratiate yourself to the president and take over the media. But was taking this job a bad idea? A lot of people seem to really hate me. My Tesla stock is crashing, and my personal net worth just dropped by $100 billion,” his inner voice said, that last line a reference to Myers’ line–as Dr. Evil–in Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery.

	Trump then recapped the meeting.

	“One: America’s doing ‘bad guy’ now. Two: Marco, get your budget under control. And three: Elon, stay in your lane. You’re not the boss.”

President Donald Trump declined to predict whether the U.S. could face a recession amid stock market concerns about his tariff actions on Mexico, Canada and China over fentanyl.
The Republican president, whose trade policies have rekindled fears of worsening U.S. inflation, was asked if he expected a recession this year in a Fox News interview broadcast on Sunday.
""There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big. We're bringing wealth back to America,"" Trump told the ""Sunday Morning Futures"" program. ""It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us.""
Tariffs have been one key concern for investors, as many believe they can harm economic growth and be inflationary. While Trump acknowledged as early as February 2 that his sweeping tariffs could cause some ""short-term"" pain for Americans, his own advisers have repeatedly downplayed any negative impact.
""Absolutely not,"" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on Sunday. ""There's going to be no recession in America.""
Lutnick did acknowledge that the Trump tariffs would lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers on some foreign-made goods, but said American products will get cheaper.
""He's not going to step off the gas,"" Lutnick said on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""
Trump imposed new 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada last Tuesday, along with fresh duties on Chinese goods, after he declared the top three U.S. trading partners had failed to do enough to stem the flow of deadly fentanyl and its precursor chemicals into the United States.
Two days later, he exempted many imports from Mexico and some from Canada from those tariffs for a month, the latest twist in a fluctuating trade policy that has whipsawed markets and fanned worries about U.S. inflation and growth.
It was the second time in two months that Trump has walked back fentanyl-related tariffs on the U.S. neighbors.
""If fentanyl ends, I think these will come off. But if fentanyl does not end, or he's uncertain about it, he will stay this way until he is comfortable,"" Lutnick said.
White House officials say Canada and Mexico are conduits for shipments of fentanyl - which is 50 times more potent than heroin - and its precursor chemicals into the U.S. in small packages that are often not inspected.
Public data shows 0.2% of all fentanyl seized in the U.S. comes from the Canadian border, while the vast majority arrives via Mexico. In a concession to Trump, Canada appointed a new fentanyl czar last month.
The exemptions for the two largest U.S. trading partners expire on April 2, when Trump has threatened to impose a global regime of reciprocal tariffs on all U.S. trading partners.
Kevin Hassett, director of the White House's National Economic Council, said on ABC's ""This Week"" that he hoped the drug-related tariffs can be resolved by the end of the month so the focus can be on imposing the reciprocal measures.
TRADE CONFUSION
Seesaw tariff announcements have unnerved Wall Street as investors say flip-flopping moves by the Trump administration to roll back levies on trading partners are causing confusion rather than bringing relief.
The Trump trade policies have raised fears of trade wars that could slam economic growth and raise prices for Americans still smarting from years of high inflation.
China said it would ""resolutely counter"" pressure from the United States on the fentanyl issue after Trump imposed tariffs of 20% on all imports from China.
Democratic senators from two border states criticized Trump's tariff policy as inconsistent and irresponsible.
""These broad, indiscriminate and on-again, off-again tariffs don't help anyone. They don't help farmers. They don't help auto workers. They're a mistake,"" U.S. Senator Adam Schiff of California said on ABC.
""Pounding Canada as if they're the exact same thing as China - it just creates this chaotic feeling,"" U.S. Senator Elissa Slotkin, of Michigan, said on NBC.
Trump said he put a hold on tariffs on some goods last week because, ""I wanted to help Mexico and Canada,"" according to the ""Sunday Morning Futures"" interview, which was taped on Thursday.
The three countries are partners in a North American trade pact that was renegotiated by Trump during his first White House term.
Yet Trump also told the Fox News program that those 25% tariffs ""may go up"" and he said on Friday that his administration could soon impose reciprocal tariffs on Canadian lumber and other products.
Separately, U.S. tariffs of 25% on imports of steel and aluminum will take effect as scheduled on Wednesday, Lutnick said during the interview. Canada and Mexico are both top exporters of the metals to U.S. markets, with Canada in particular accounting for most aluminum imports.

The recession will result because there is no longer any confidence in the Bumbler-in-Chief.
""There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big. We're bringing wealth back to America,"" Trump told the ""Sunday Morning Futures"" program.
It would be good if that so-called ""wealth"" would go to ALL Americans, but like in his last term, I have a feeling it will only go to his rich buddies.
> ""Pounding Canada as if they're the exact same thing as China - it just creates this chaotic feeling,"" U.S. Senator Elissa Slotkin, of Michigan, said on NBC.
I agree, since way more Fetanyl comes in from China than Canada.
Public data shows 0.2% of all fentanyl seized in the U.S. comes from the Canadian border, while the vast majority arrives via Mexico. In a concession to Trump, Canada appointed a new fentanyl czar last month.
If Trump was so worried about drugs, he would also help to secure drugs going out of the U.S. and into Canada, since the amount going into Canada is way more than the amount coming into the U.S.
https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trump-complaints-drugs-guns-border-1.7457605
Besides, we all know this trade war with Canada has nothing to do with Fetanyl.  Otherwise, why would he have released Ross Ulbricht, who is the founder of Silk Road, an underground marketplace to sell illegal drugs?  Trump obviously doesn't care about the making and distribution of illegal drugs, since that website allowed dealers to remain anonymous, and allowed easy access to drugs, many of them dangerous.
MAGA Recession
“Lutnick did acknowledge that the Trump tariffs would lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers on some foreign-made goods, but said American products will get cheaper.“
domestic producers always raise their prices to match the higher priced imported goods.
more fentanyl is confiscated and more illegal borders cross from the u.s. to canada than to the u.s. from canada.
you can’t believe a word coming out of the new kremlin in washington.
Trump declines to predict whether recession could result from his tariff moves
""Absolutely not,"" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on Sunday. ""There's going to be no recession in America.""
Is it me or are they starting to sound like more and more like Comical Ali? (For people under 20: he's the iraqi general who famously said, amongst other nonsense,  ""There are no American troops in Baghdad!"" while the American troops where invading Baghdad)
It’s ok just change the definition of “recession” like Biden did. 
Then there will be never be a recession.
No ""American"" has a right to challenge other Americans why they don't live there anymore. Everyone is in Japan on the same boat through Republican and Democrat presidencies.
Like it matters. Trump could tell his base that thanks to these tariffs they will all be getting a check for ten thousand dollars every day for the rest of their lives and they'd believe it.
Course if the economic experts turn out to be right, then the recession will be the fault of anyone but Trump. It will be fun to see how far back he can throw the blame. Obama, easily; maybe even Clinton.
How many times did Trump file for bankruptcy? The man has no head for business or government.
stormcrowToday  07:39 am JST
How many times did Trump file for bankruptcy? 
I'm sure his DPS (ditzy press secretary) will soon be at the podium to announce the release of a new set of Official US Social Studies textbooks, in which every single business venture started by Trump was a massive success and resulted in profits so massive they had to invent a new mathematical term for them.
By definition there can’t even be a recession by definition until at least July.  Then as I said, when Biden had one he just changed the definition anyway.
liberals will probably start saying “but I feeeeeel like it’s a recession, that “outdated” definition doesn’t matter anymore” soon?
It’s ok just change the definition of “recession” like Biden did.
I'll take ""Right-wing talking points about stuff that never happened"" for $200!
https://www.businessinsider.com/recession-definition-biden-white-house-gdp-inflation-outlook-economic-recovery-2022-7
“We're bringing wealth back to America”
For the top 1% who’ve always had it. Anyone who believes otherwise is a fool.
Oh it happened. 2 quarters of negative GDP, the historical definition.
Yeah of course it happened! When you only consider the stuff you want to consider and not the actual definition of the National Bureau of Economic Research (an organization I'm sure Trump will downsize very soon so that they can't put out factual numbers about his catastrophical economy).
Go Trump Go, 
Nothing wrong with bringing jobs back HOME. 
Nothing wrong with reciprocal tariffs either.
So whats the definition of recession?
https://www.nber.org/research/business-cycle-dating/business-cycle-dating-procedure-frequently-asked-questions
Lots of White MAGA supporters will.be impacted by Trump policies harshly, especially those in MAGA counties,were they are already the poorest
the last time trump tried this, jobs were lost.
turn off fox news.
President Donald Trump declined to predict whether the U.S. could face a recession amid stock market concerns about his tariff actions on Mexico, Canada and China over fentanyl.
He knows he made a mistake that will tank the economy, but he doesn't have the honor to own up to it and apologize, and his followers are fake smiling and pretending that Biden did the same because Maga always plays the blame game
Go Trump Go,
Nothing wrong with bringing jobs back HOME.
Nothing wrong with reciprocal tariffs either.
I know that your only purpose on here is to troll, but let's hear your prediction of a) how many such jobs will be created, and b) when they will be created.
Nobody said shifting US economy from historically high Govt. deficits and trade deficits would be perfectly seamless. Pivoting to private sector focus takes time.
Good news, record amounts of capital being deployed and flowing into US, due to cuts in costly regulations, tax rates and tax incentives like immediate CapX expensing.
Furthermore, interest rates dropping because bond markets like more domestic energy production and downsizing Govt. via DOGE = fewer Treasuries to be issued
Let's not forget, if countries lower their tariffs to match US rates, creates a global virtuous cycle, lower prices and more choice for consumers, which equals affordability relief and economic growth.
Many countries and trading blocks, like the EU already cutting their tariff rates. Process will play out over time, but ending global proxy war and stabilizing Mid East will also be huge growth and confidence catalysts
Think about absurdity of Canadian dairy farmers or timber companies having triple digit tariffs to protect their home market while having essentially free access to much larger US market - makes no sense to anyone
This Moron may be even dumber than Trump...
""Absolutely not,"" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on Sunday. ""There's going to be no recession in America.""
Lutnick did acknowledge that the Trump tariffs would lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers on some foreign-made goods, but said American products will get cheaper.
Reporter:  ""Will there be inflation?""  
Lutnick:  ""No""
Reporter:  ""Will prices rise?""
Lutnick:  ""Of course""....
Typical MAGA nonsense and double-talk...
These incompetents don't have a clue on the economy and just like back in 2007/8 when we had a Repub President, they're going to crash everything...
MAGA voters will lose their jobs (if they haven't already), lose their health care, their social security, and any unemployment.  Trump, Musk, and the rest of the ultra-rich will fatten their wallets with tax breaks and corruption...
Just what you voted for, right MAGA-fans?  Sending you and your family into poverty...
Reporter: ""Will prices rise?""
Lutnick: ""Of course""....
how do you get “of course” (with quotation marks like he said it) from what he really said?: some foreign goods price will rise but US made will drop.
make no mistake about it. republican administrations tank economies and raise deficits. democratic administrations do not.
the last time there was a balanced budget - for 2 years - was under clinton.
reagan,  bush, bush, trump and now trump lowered taxes for the wealthy and corporations while throwing everyone else under the bus.
“some foreign goods price will rise but US made will drop.“
no. they go up.
how do you get “of course” (with quotation marks like he said it) from what he really said?: some foreign goods price will rise but US made will drop.
Absurd.  How will US prices drop when US workers earn more than double or triple what someone overseas earns?
There's a reason Trump makes all his clothing line, high-tops, and Bibles in China..and by the way, still does...
He can't possibly predict what he doesn't understand.
He will be impeached in 2026
Trumps first term in office provided very small gains to our investments.  Under Biden, we saw investment gains over 20% per year.
Trump is bad for the economy.  Bad for trade. Bad for peace. Bad for alliances. Bad for the world.  
Trump will be gone in 1412 days.
I was bored yesterday, so wrote a tiny program to track the days until Trump is out of Office, assuming he doesn't get tried for treason, killed, die, or resign in disgrace before that time.
creates a global virtuous cycle, lower prices and more choice for consumers, which equals affordability relief and economic growth.
Japan has zero tariffs on many things and look how affordable this country is. Not rice but Japanese don't want outside rice anyway. There is a schedule to reduce tariffs to zero for cheese. Japan is going the right direction....Trump is not. Trump people in Japan should realize President Elon's bad trade policy. Tesla is down by the way and real corporate executives don't like Trump. Only Trump people like President Elon.
Absurd
your opinion. 
doesn’t give you any right to falsely change what he actually said, then when put it in quotes.
Trump will be gone in 1412 days.
Boy if THAT isn’t some cope. 
then it’s 8 years of Vance, right?
Voters want results. Nobody liked Biden Admin's terrible inflation and affordability crisis except rich who benefited from historic increases in money supply & fiscal spending.
Transition to private led sector economy now underway.
Consider US population growth has been only a couple % in last 5 years since Pandemic started and yet Federal Spending up over 50%? It's not sustainable, why Trump's rightsizing US Govt. via DOGE digital audit catalyst.
Absurd
your opinion.
doesn’t give you any right to falsely change what he actually said, then when put it in quotes.
Sure...
Wanna now explain to us how US made goods will REDUCE prices when labor costs will triple or quadruple?
And why is Trump making all his high-tops and Bibles in China if it's cheaper to make in the US?
HopeSpringsEternal
Voters want results. Nobody liked Biden Admin's terrible inflation and affordability crisis except rich who benefited from historic increases in money supply & fiscal spending.
And after Biden brought down Covid inflation, Trump’s election has pushed up inflation.
The Stock Market, which flourished under Biden, is also tanking.
I guess voting Trump was a mistake.
US inflation is DOWN, just look at the bond markets, yields have fallen substantially since Jan 20th! US long term inflation expectations falling due to DJT's agenda.
DJT Agenda includes more domestic energy production, cutting costly regulations, DOGE Govt. efficiency mission to reduce Govt. spending, and stopping global Ukraine proxy war destroying currency real asset purchasing power.
Worth noting that if other countries, and they are, equalize with the US regarding tariffs, prices will drop for all consumers in both the US and across the world!
DJT economic agenda - MAIN Street, NOT Wall Street, helping the working and middle class with better jobs and affordability in general, by bringing down inflation!
Read it and weep MAGA-fans....
*Recent polling has revealed a decline in consumer confidence regarding the American economy, contributing to a drop in President Donald Trump’s approval ratings. Since taking office, Trump’s job approval has decreased by three points, now standing at 44 percent. Trump’s proposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada, postponed until March, have garnered only 41 percent approval, with *54 percent opposing the measures.
*Reuters wrote, “Public approval of *Trump’s economic stewardship fell to 39% from 43% in the prior poll.”
*Surveys showed that *public approval of Trump’s economic management has diminished, falling to 39 percent. The change is a decrease from 43 percent in previous polling.
*Reuters stated, *“The share of Americans who think the economy is on the wrong track rose to 53% in the latest poll from 43% in the January 24-26 poll.”
*Concerns over inflation have intensified, with *the consumer price index rising by 3 percent year-over-year as of January. Only 32 percent of respondents approved of Trump’s approach to inflation.

Those numbers are abysmal - and it's only two months into his term...watch them sink even lower as the price increases really start hitting home...

US inflation is DOWN, just look at the bond markets, yields have fallen substantially since Jan 20th! 
The bond market doesn’t determine inflation.
Inflation is up.
Nope, egg prices are up but inflation clearly trending down due to Trump policies the bond markets are pricing into yields. We know the yield on ten-year US treasury was over 4.8%, now about 4.27%,
Markets always up and down but Trump's attracting record capital flows into US, as investors like Softbank love DJT economic policies especially relative to highly inflationary $expensive high regulation Biden Admin policies
Saudi Arabia just committed $1.4 TRILLION to US over next 4 years, because of DJT's US economic growth policies, including using tariffs to get other countries to 'equalize' their rates or localize US production.
Economists calculate approx. $1 Trillion in US foreign investment results in GDP increase of approx. 1%
There is no other choice but to impose tariffs as a means of regulating the US economy.
When Americans need a widget for their car, is the only choice going to be a product from China?
No!
And remember tariffs can be regulated in either direction.
News reports should be more honest. These are new taxes self-identifying as tariffs.
Kurisupisu, you'd be right in a normal world, but it's US that runs huge trade deficits and has lower tariff rates.
Other countries can either lower their tariffs or face 'equal/reciprocal' tariffs, as they have no real leverage given large trade surpluses they're trying to protect.
inflation clearly trending down due to Trump policies 
US inflation rates:
November: 2.7%
December: 2.9%
January: 3.0% 
(Feb data not available yet)
I'm not a math expert but those numbers seem to be getting bigger, not smaller, to me.
Trump's attracting record capital flows into US
Tesla? They are not going up. And SpaceX blew up another rocket which delayed a bunch of flights. President Elon no longer wears a silly t-shirt to his white house.
Economists calculate approx. $1 Trillion in US foreign investment results in GDP increase of approx. 1%
yet about 2 trillion has been wiped from the markets in the last 2 month due to Trump  trade war,  itll only get worse
headline monthly CPI numbers, but annualized numbers for inflation are falling. More importantly, markets looking forward, pricing in changes to policies impacting inflation = they like DJT's economic & inflation policy agenda
Reason US voters trust so much on the economy, they remember Trump 1.0 and experienced Biden inflation disaster, so comparison gives DJT a powerful mandate
Then as I said, when Biden had one he just changed the definition anyway.
recession is 2 quarters of negative GDP growth,  show us the data where Biden met that definition of a recession.
Probably best indicator world's now stabilizing is price of oil is trending down. Tariffs will sort themselves out or companies will begin to produce in the US to avoid.
Endling wars and normalizing economic relations across world will increase economic growth and put downward pressure on inflation - that's DJT's economic agenda
My goodness - look what's getting ""MAGA cancelled"" now - talking about ""egg prices""...
*President Donald T*rump, as president-elect, insisted he “won an election” based on the price of groceries —and promised to “bring those prices way down.”
""Very simple word, groceries,” Trump told Meet the Press host Kristen Welker in December. “Like almost, you know, who uses the word? I started using the word – the groceries. When you buy apples, when you buy bacon, when you buy eggs, they would double and triple the price over a short period of time, and I won an election based on that.”
“We’re going to bring those prices way down,” Trump insisted.
*But now, a mere three months after that interview and six weeks into his presidency, Trump would very much like you to stop talking about the cost of groceries — or, at least, “shut up about egg prices” — according to an op-ed by Turning Point Action CEO Charlie Kirk reposted by the president to his Truth Social feed Saturday.*
Per the Guardian, “Egg prices have soared to record highs this year, with the cost of a dozen large eggs hitting almost $7 in Feb – more than two and a half times the average price three years ago,.  
Given all his other failures, there must be a quite large ""cancel list"" in the WH...
Democrats sure want to talk about eggs, but nobody wants to listen after Biden Admin record inflation.
DJT trying to quickly solve many problems, that are all connected in a way, like wars, excessive Govt. spending, $expensive regulations and terrible trade policies that fuel inflation, high interest rates and affordability crisis.
Fortunately, US voters Trust DJT and easy to understand why given Biden's historically low approval rating. For the first time in decades majority of Americans think the US in on the 'right track' = big change since Jan 20th
Democrats sure want to talk about eggs, but nobody wants to listen after Biden Admin record inflation.
ROFL...
DJT trying to quickly solve many problems, that are all connected in a way, like wars, excessive Govt. spending, $expensive regulations and terrible trade policies that fuel inflation, high interest rates and affordability crisis.
All caused by his own incompetence...
Fortunately, US voters Trust DJT and easy to understand why given Biden's historically low approval rating. For the first time in decades majority of Americans think the US in on the 'right track' = big change since Jan 20th
Utterly ridiculous...
Read the poll numbers above again; Only 32 percent of respondents approved of Trump’s approach to inflation.
That's less than one-third - Biden had better numbers than that...
The American public sees what Trump's incompetence, chaos, and tariffs cause - economic collapse...
""If fentanyl ends, I think these will come off. But if fentanyl does not end, or he's uncertain about it, he will stay this way until he is comfortable,"" Lutnick said.
The economy left to the whims of a thin-skinned, petulant three-year-old.

The main insurance giants have also ended higher at the close of trade on Monday in the wake of ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred.
Although the three insurers recorded higher gains earlier during the session, they moderated slightly by the close.
Here's how the shares ended on Monday:
By Kate Ainsworth
The ASX 200 has ended higher for the first session of the week, gaining 0.2% to close at 7,962 points.
The modest bounce comes after local shares fell sharply last week — and ended at a six-month low on Friday.
On the sectors front, eight out of the 11 sectors ended in positive territory, with energy stocks leading the momentum (+1.6%) followed by basic materials (+1.3%) and utilities (+0.8%).
However, the gains could be short-lived with new US tariffs on steel and aluminium imports coming into effect on Wednesday (plus the weaker-than-expected inflation data out of China over the weekend).

Donald Trump once said that he could shoot someone in Times Square and not lose any votes. Elon Musk's recent effects on Tesla prove that is not true. How has 'X' fared?
- Andy Smith
Hi Andy,
It's a good question, but one that's a bit difficult to answer with any great certainty because Elon Musk took Twitter private at the end of October 2022, before rebranding it to X in March 2023. (Can you believe it's been two years?!)
X being a privately held company means there's far less transparency about how it performs, but there's been no shortage of commentary about how it's fared.
(And to clarify Donald Trump's comments that Andy referenced, he did indeed make those comments during the 2016 presidential campaign — here's an NPR article which covered it at the time.)

While you were busy enjoying your weekend, China was busy releasing crucial economic data — and frankly, it wasn't crash hot.
The world's second largest economy is back dealing with deflation.
No, that's not slowing inflation, it's negative inflation, which means prices are falling.
China's consumer prices fell 0.7% year-on-year in February, reversing a 0.5% rise in January.
""China has entered a deflationary cycle,"" Wall Street Journal Chief China Correspondent Lingling Wei said.
""Its current 'stimulus plan' — which is much less about supporting households than about helping factories reduce excessive inventories — will make it worse.""
This, combined with US tariff policies, and rising risks of a US recession, has seen heavy selling in Hong Kong and mainland China-listed stocks.
At the time of writing, Hong Kong's Hang Seng is down over 2%.

Lacklustre inflation data out of China on Sunday has fuelled concerns that the country's economy may struggle to meet its growth targets, at the same time it faces a trade war with the US.
Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics yesterday showed that China's CPI in February fell at the sharpest pace in 13 months, falling by 0.7% year-on-year.
(Comparatively, China's CPI in January rose by 0.5%.)
It's the first time China's CPI has contracted since January 2024, and missed economists' expectations, with those polled by Reuters forecasting a 0.5% slide.
Meanwhile, the figures showed producer price deflation persisted, falling by 2.2% in the year to February — but was the smallest contraction recorded in six months.
Analysts say the results could see China roll out more stimulus measures to help the country to reach its 2025 economic growth target of about 5%.
""China's economy still faces deflationary pressure,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.
""While sentiment was improved by the developments in the technology space, domestic demand remains weak.""
With exports at risk due to the trade war with the US, Zhang added that the country's fiscal policy needed to be more proactive, while China's property sector is also struggling.
""Monetary policy also needs to be loosened further with interest rate and reserve requirement ratio cuts, as indicated by the government work report,"" he said.

A deadline for TikTok to find a buyer in the US is fast approaching, with 49 days having passed since a last-minute executive order signed by President Donald Trump delayed the platform being banned in the country.
The app did briefly go dark on January 19 to comply with US law, which would see the Chinese-owned platform banned for national security reasons unless it was sold.
But Trump's executive order gave a 75-day reprieve to when the law would be enforced — and that extension comes to an end at the start of April. (Although Trump has previously said he would ""probably"" extend the deadline.)
Speaking on Air Force One earlier today, Trump said there ""could"" be a deal soon on TikTok, and told reporters that there were ""four different groups"" who were interested in purchasing the platform.
""We're dealing with four different groups, and a lot of people want it ... all four are good,"" he said.
TikTok and its parent company ByteDance have not responded to Trump's comments.
As for how much TikTok could be worth? Some analysts say it's as much as $US50 billion — or a cool $79.2 billion.

After weeks of frantic deal making, Star looks to have pulled off a late save — on Friday, the casino operator confirmed a $53 million deal with Hong Kong investors, involving its Queensland assets, in addition to options to refinance its debt.
Prior to Friday's announcements, insiders had warned voluntary administration was looming.
Omkar Joshi, the chief investment officer of Opal Capital Management, however, says Star's woes aren't totally resolved by the arrangements.
""It doesn't take a potential collapse off the table but it does give them more time to get through their cashflow issues given the access to new liquidity which is helpful,"" Mr Joshi said.
Now, Star has received a proposal from Bally's, a US casino and gaming giant, to back a capital raising of at least $250 million in exchange for a controlling stake in Star.
""It's hard to compare the two plans as we don't really have much detail from Bally's currently but it's good to see different options emerging which could then avoid a voluntary administration process.
""There's still quite a lot of work that needs to be done by Star's board and management in comparing the plans and seeing if this latest proposal from Bally potentially brings out others as well.
""Bally's have long history in operating casinos so that is definitely helpful longer term, but at the moment Star's immediate concern is the haemorrhaging of their cash balance and lack of access to new meaningful liquidity.
""If they can solve that problem then a partner like Bally's would be helpful to have around.""
Mr Joshi said Bally's approach is unlikely to draw out a lot of new proposals from other bidders, given there's already been plenty of time for offers to be put on the table.

Shares in uranium developer Bannerman Energy are lower this morning, after long-time director Mike Leech announced his resignation.
Mr Leech has been a non-executive director with Bannerman since April 2017, and has been the chair of the company's audit committee.
""Our board has benefited greatly from Leech's skills and experience over last eight years, particularly his extensive knowledge of operating uranium mines within Namibia,"" Bannerman's chair Brandon Munro said in a statement.
""Mike has played an instrumental role in helping advance Etango to its current stage and will provide ongoing leadership in-country as we progress through the construction phase of the Etango mine.
""On behalf of the entire Bannerman board, I extend a heartfelt thank you to Mike for his outstanding contribution over the journey to date.""
Mr Leech will remain in his role as a director of Bannerman's Namibian subsidiary, Bannerman Mining Resources.
Shares in Bannerman had fallen by as much as 1.4% today to $2.12 — their lowest level since September 11 — while its stock has shed 26.9% so far this year.

In the wake of ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred, insurance companies aren't just dealing with an increase in claims as households begin to assess the damage — their share prices are also climbing during trade on the ASX today.
Suncorp is seeing the largest gains out of all the property and casualty insurers — its share price is up 3.1% to $19.31 so far today.
Earlier in the session, Suncorp had recorded its largest gain since February 20.
Similarly, insurance giant IAG (or Insurance Australia Group, which has subsidiaries of CGU and SGIO) is 1.3% higher, while QBE has picked up 1.2% during trade.

While Star Entertainment ponders a bid from Bally's that would give the struggling casino group at least $250 million in funding, the US gaming giant says it would be open to lobbing an even bigger offer for the company.
Bally's current proposal for Star — which was an unsolicited offer received at the last minute — would give the US company a controlling 50.1% stake in the struggling casino operator.
In the letter received by Star, Bally's noted that it remains ""very open to discussing a larger transaction depending on our discussions with respect to Star's liquidity and capital needs"".

Star Entertainment pulled back from the brink of collapse last week, reaching a deal with Hong Kong investors to sell out of Brisbane's Queens Wharf and take full control of its Gold Coast casino precinct — in addition to bridging finance and a refinancing deal that would give it access to up to $940 million in debt.
Now, Star's confirmed that it's received an offer from US casino and gaming giant Bally's, to take control of Star in exchange for $250 million in funding.
Bally's describes its offer as ""an alternative path"" to Star's Friday announcements.
""In short, we firmly believe that our approach… of new long-term capital plus operational track record will unlock the best alternative for Star and its shareholders.""
Bally's proposes a $250 million capital raising, underwritten by Bally's, in exchange for 50.1 per cent of Star's shares.
The proposal also said the US company remains ""very open to discussing a larger transaction depending on our discussions with respect to Star's liquidity and capital needs"".

This article will focus on single individuals and when the best time is to file for Social Security benefits. Singles are defined as anyone who has never had a spouse, or someone who has had a spouse and was not married to that person for a least 10 years.
Just about every article written about this topic centers around your age as the best time to file. Although age is important, it should only be one of the factors that you consider when determining when to file for Social Security benefits.
 
Every situation is different, so the right filing date is unique to you. What do you need to consider before filing for benefits? The considerations listed below will guide you in determining your filing date:
Cash Flow — Do you need the money now?
Working — Will you be working from age 62 to your full retirement age? If so, you will be subject to the annual earnings limitation of $23,400 in 2025.
Children — Do you have children from a previous marriage that are under 19?
Health — How is your current health and do you expect to live to 80?
Genes — Does longevity run in your family?
Taxes — Are you concerned about taxes and being pushed into a higher tax bracket?
Investments — How will your investment portfolio (investments in the stock market, IRAs, 401(k)s) supplement your retirement cash flow and affect your claiming strategy?
Future — Even before the new Department of Government Efficiency initiatives, the Social Security administration was expecting a 20% to 30% reduction in benefits between 2032 and 2034 if no changes are made to secure the necessary funding to continue benefits at current levels. Because of this, you should consider taking benefits earlier than you had projected.
Singles have a different planning process as they do not have the added step of coordinating their Social Security benefits with a spouse. Also, to defer taking your benefit so your spouse will have a greater survivor benefit is not in the equation. For most singles, I’ve always been a proponent of taking their benefit at their full retirement age, unless cash flow is needed sooner to support your existing lifestyle. The reason for waiting until full retirement age is that the annual earnings limitation goes away and the increase in lifetime benefits by waiting until 70 is only about 3%.
The chart below shows your lifetime benefits using a life expectancy of 85 at different full retirement age levels. Bottom line, no matter what your full retirement age benefit is, waiting to collect benefits at 70 versus 67, will only produce an increase of lifetime benefits of approximately 3%.
Lifetime Benefits Using a Life Expectancy of 85 at Different Full Retirement Age Levels
One final thought, if you file for benefits after your full retirement age you should consider requesting retroactive benefits. You may be able to receive up to six months of benefits up front.
Determining your personal Social Security claiming strategy should consist of taking these variables into account. Remember, take the wrong benefit at the wrong time, it’s always smaller and forever."

Tesla, Elon Musk’s most lucrative business, is facing a major slump. The electric vehicle maker is seeing a plunge in sales globally, and February marked Tesla’s worst month on the stock market since 2022.
There are a number of factors that could be contributing to Tesla’s woes. But industry analysts point to Musk’s emergence as a right-wing extremist meddling in politics across the West as a likely factor.
Tesla’s difficulties underscore how Musk’s political ambitions — many of which benefit him financially — are likely undermining some of the source of his power. The slump in Tesla sales also suggests that a new frontier for activism against the richest man in the world could be forming around a simple idea: Don’t buy his stuff.
Activists across Europe are linking Musk's politics to Tesla ownership and encouraging consumer boycotts.
In California, Tesla’s biggest market in the U.S., its sales dropped almost 8% in the fourth quarter of 2024, and 12% for the year. Bloomberg News reported that in recent months, trust and likability sentiment toward Tesla has dropped to its lowest point since at least 2023 and estimated that Musk’s role in the U.S. election likely cost him business in California last year. Musk’s favorability plummeted in the fall of 2024, with just 6% of Democrats and 31% of independents surveyed in a September NBC News poll reporting positive feelings about Musk.
Tesla is also taking a notable bruising abroad. Axios reports that “Tesla sales are down 71% in Germany this year, 45% in Norway, 44% in France and 44% in Spain, according to registration data reported by Electrek.” The downturn in Germany is particularly notable because Germany has the largest electric vehicle market in Europe, and because it’s a country where Musk has been intervening in national politics particularly aggressively. Ahead of Germany’s February election, Musk advocated for the far-right Alternative for Germany party and said at a virtual event for the party that there’s “too much of a focus on past guilt” in that country.
Though Tesla also saw a 49% dive in sales in China in February, compared to a year earlier, observers of the electric car sector say that’s more likely explained by increased competition from inexpensive Chinese competitors.
While rising competition and the decision by some consumers to wait for a new Tesla model could be playing a role in the dip in sales abroad, Musk’s increasingly polarizing, swashbuckling behavior as a global activist can’t be dismissed. It’s a particularly plausible theory given that, as The New York Times reports, activists across Europe are linking Musk's politics to Tesla ownership and encouraging consumer boycotts.
Tesla, once a brand associated with stewardship of the environment and boasting a clear liberal constituency, is becoming stigmatized as an emblem of right-wing extremism. People disgruntled with Musk in the U.S. and Europe are vandalizing Tesla charging stations and dealerships and cars, often with messages likening Musk to a Nazi in the wake of his gesture at a rally in January that resembled a Nazi salute. At a Carnival parade in New Orleans on Monday evening, four Tesla Cybertrucks “took a pummeling of beads, boos and barbs from paradegoers,” a local newspaper reported, noting that “at least one shattered window was reported before each Cybertruck bailed.”
Owners of Teslas who disapprove of Musk’s political turn are placing “I Bought This Before We Knew Elon Was Crazy” bumper stickers on their cars, which may also serve as a way to ward off potential vandals.
Tesla is still by far the most popular electric vehicle maker in the U.S. But as Musk’s political identity begins to outstrip his identity as a businessman, the company could see its fortunes change for reasons that have nothing to do with the quality of its cars.

Each year on her birthday, my friend Edith sends an email to everyone she’s ever met (within reason). She invites us to her favorite place on Earth: a remote spa 20 minutes north of Palm Springs. The itinerary is nonexistent. The goal? There is none. I mean, you can soak. Read. Stare into space. Fraternize with her other friends or stay in your room and sleep.
A few people show up. Most don’t.
“Everything is weird, nothing is normal, I’m in a constant state of low-grade agitation and exhaustion and also total surprise and rage that my life didn’t turn out how it was supposed to,” she wrote last year. She’ll add ex-boyfriends and ex-friends to the invitation list, because why not. In an FAQ section, she writes, “Perhaps we were romantically entangled at one point and you think I’m mad at you? Well, if you’re on this email, I’m not.”
I aspire to be this honest—and forgiving—in 20 years.
Edith is 54. I’m 37. We met after I started reading her anonymous dating blog during the COVID pandemic—I loved it so much that I reached out. Now, years later, if you stopped me on the street and asked me to tell you who my best friend is, I’d say it was her. We live on opposite sides of the country and have no mutual friends, but we talk every Saturday.
Ours is technically an intergenerational friendship, defined by the AARP as a friendship with someone at least 15 years older or younger than you. Though our 17-year age gap isn’t enormous, it’s significant—just large enough to place us in different census-designated age brackets, or for Edith to have birthed me right before she went to Sarah Lawrence for undergrad.
Age gaps in relationships always make people do a double take. They feel vaguely transgressive, probably because in romantic contexts they’re associated with conversations about what’s legal or socially “acceptable.” But they’re rarely discussed when it comes to friends. They should be—they’re actually quite common.
Around 4 in 10 people have an intergenerational friendship, though none of my peers seem to. (If they do, they’re hiding it.) This is surprising, as more than 100 studies over the past 50 years have found that close friends self-segregate by almost every characteristic (age, gender, race, education, politics). Our cliques homogenize as we age. Psychologists theorize that homophily (being drawn to people similar to you) is a risk-management strategy: If we’re the same age, gender, race, or class, we’re pulling from a shared bank of references, meaning we’re less likely to unintentionally confuse or mislead each other.
Maybe that’s why people are so shocked when you announce having a close friend (not a mentor, colleague, or service project) who could be your parent. “What do you talk about?” a guy asked me recently on a first date when I told him about Edith. The subtext was something like: What do you know that the rest of us don’t?
The further back in time you go, the weirder my friendship with Edith seems. When I was in kindergarten, Edith was renting a $1,200 one-bedroom with her ex-boyfriend. (The space has since been turned into “luxury” rentals starting at $8,500—it’s around the corner from where I live now.) While I was listening to Raffi on my dad’s lap, she was vibing to Portishead on her Walkman. While I was silently watching the towers fall on a rolling TV cart in freshman-year homeroom, she was a 31-year-old attorney scrambling across the Williamsburg Bridge in a pencil skirt to escape the dust.
Even today, our differences are legion. We speak different languages; she says wacko and chill pill, never lol. She smokes when stressed; I scroll. Her jokes are sarcastic; mine are self-deprecating. Her interior design style is Iris Apfel–inspired “maximalist hot grandma,” which in practice means overlapping animal-inspired patterns and a leopard-print couch. I, without realizing it, decorated my apartment like a third-wave coffee shop: minimalist blond wood and Scandi-inspired furniture with a few “pops” of color, the minimalist aesthetic that dominated Instagram when I was in my 20s. (She’s so put off by millennial minimalism that she calls it “suicide-watch chic.”)
But adult friendships—ones that last, at least—run deeper than cultural references. After your 20s, friendships rooted in the soft, tenuous soil of commiserating over early failures or obsessing over [insert the sitcom of your generation here] tend to fade as people become actually skilled at something and their lives start to take shape. Peer groups thin out. Suddenly, you’re seeing each other twice a year (if that) and clinging desperately to whatever inside joke or shared bit you established a decade ago. Underneath the surface tension of exchanging vital stats, you’re comparing lives, wondering: If we started in the same spot, how have we grown so far apart?
Alice Vincent, a 36-year-old writer who befriended an 80-year-old named Diana during the pandemic, told me: “Whatever stage of life you’re at, people tend to talk about the same things: house prices, the job market, baby shit. Talking to someone whose life wasn’t part of all that lets us have much broader conversations.” She and Diana would discuss things you’re not supposed to talk about directly with peers (or, if you do, it’s polite to insert a little ironic distance): professional envy, regret, death.
These are Edith’s and my favorite subjects. “I shouldn’t have sold my house in Brooklyn,” she said to me once, admitting regret in a straightforward way millennials don’t. (She’s lived in a Silver Lake bungalow for 25 years.) “I’m jealous of my friend’s hot boyfriend,” I can say to her bluntly, and she won’t try to deflect or turn it back on me in the form of some type of self-love tip.
Diana, who died last fall, lived alone. (Edith and I do too.) She had no kids. The older counterparts in these relationships, at least those I’ve come across, tend to be childless. It would be easy to view their younger friends as surrogate kids, but that’s not how it feels. It’s more of a sibling dynamic, probably because the older friends bring such a zesty, youthful energy to the relationship.
Something about existing “outside the realm of family life,” as Alice puts it, made Diana seem almost like a spiritual younger sister. “She spent money in a way I would,” Alice remembers—trendy lunches; the “talked about” book on her coffee table at all times—“and she wore clothes I would have worn.”
Maybe that points to a grand unified theory of friendship: We’re drawn to friends who match our internal age more than our external one.
Case in point: Ruby, an 80-year-old who met three now-thirtysomething friends almost 20 years ago when she was mentoring at a student theater program. Ruby reads extremely young to me. She sends her niece heinous prank Christmas gifts (e.g. The Little Penis: A Finger Puppet Parody Book) and smokes pot with her thirtysomething besties (whom she calls “kids”). Like Edith and me, she’s childless. “I never wanted any kids, so when I meet them and they’re cool, I keep them,” she told me over the phone. “People’s mothers have called me and said, ‘What are you doing with my son?’ ”
Aoife Malone, a 19-year-old fashion student who befriended a 98-year-old widower right before the pandemic, also remembers him as acting younger than his age. He once modeled for one of her university projects, vogueing for the camera with a copy of Dazed.
“I think you look at me like I’m a big sister,” Edith said to me last week, “but that’s a mistake. I don’t actually know more than you.”
Edith loves to say she’ll give terrible advice and then accidentally give great advice. A few lessons: how to cook any filet of fish that’s not salmon (salt, garlic powder, a few pats of butter, 375 degrees for 18 minutes). Don’t “fly too close to the sun” (match your ambition with reality). Dogs are as intelligent as toddlers. If you try to look nice when you leave your home, people will treat you better, or at least differently, which will make you treat yourself differently, and over time this may change your life.
For every drop of gold, there’s a moment that throws our age gap into harsh relief, like the time Edith got irrationally freaked out by the anonymous animals in Google Docs. (She’s worked an Office Space–esque job in the federal government since 2000 and is less well versed in web-based software than millennials, or even other Gen X–ers, honestly.) “Get them out!!!” she shrieked when she shared a Google Doc with me that I, in turn, shared with a colleague who presented as “Anonymous Armadillo.” She thought it was some sort of cyberattack.
But I’m friends with Edith not for tactical reasons. That’s what my thirtysomething peers with well-lit LinkedIn headshots are for. Edith doesn’t help me fix my life. She helps me understand it and kind of hover slightly above it.
This has never been more obvious to me than the night she yelled at me for being in my 30s. I remember it vividly: I was pacing a friend’s backyard in San Francisco. I was in the middle of architecting a cross-country move, and I couldn’t decide what style shower curtain to buy (a big decision, but not that big). In front of me was a burn-down list with all the steps I’d need to take to move. Visions of the future ruled everything around me—I was sure, once I escaped my friend’s second bedroom (where I’d been sleeping for five months) and walked into my own place, I would Finally Start Living.
And I felt so old. I was already 35.
“Don’t you realize?” she yelled into the phone. “These are the good years!”
I paused.
“I was so busy setting up my life that I didn’t understand … those were the years when I should have been paying attention,” she said, referring to her 30s. “Those were the years when I should have been enjoying my life.”
In a 2022 study of 5,239 people over 60, the ones who had a close friend under 50 felt younger. And young people with older friends are less ageist (makes sense) and less self-critical of their own bodies and minds as they age. That’s how I’d characterize my relationship with Edith: an education in being less self-critical.
We have a loose agreement that if we’re still friends in 20 or 30-ish years, and if Edith is still single, I’ll make sure she has more than enough prescription opioids to zonk peacefully into the night, and I’ll tell the doctors to follow her DNR order. (She just went through this with her dad—getting them to follow a DNR order was harder than it should have been, and she’s understandably traumatized about it.) Then, I’ll host a low-key funeral at her favorite spa outside Palm Springs, where people can dip in and out, reading or sleeping or staring at the stars while we all listen to Portishead and meditate on the fact that these are the good years, the years when we should all probably be paying more attention.

And for another, it uses a slightly larger 1/1.8"" sensor compared to the more common 1/2.3"" sensor found in most cheap superzooms today. And indeed, the color is actually pretty good:

For a camera that's nearly 20 years old, I wasn't expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised. There are some omissions that are glaring in 2025 but were probably acceptable in 2006, such as the lack of a sensor to automatically turn on the EVF when you bring the camera up to your eye, as well as the absence of any sort of actually functional tracking autofocus. This was probably a bit too much to ask of what is essentially an amped-up point-and-shoot camera rather than a full-fledged DSLR.
Still, the controls make a lot of sense. There's a button on the lens to quickly select an autofocus point (something many cameras in this class/style lacked back in the day), as well as a button to switch from the EVF to the LCD screen. There are two control dials, allowing you to easily adjust aperture and shutter speed in manual mode, and a function menu that lets you quickly change settings such as ISO and metering mode.

There's also one of the strangest articulated screens I've seen, with a hinge at the bottom. In theory, it makes sense, but when you flip it around for selfie purposes, you quickly realize that the tripod mount gets in the way of the screen. It's a very tiny 2.0"" screen as well.
The camera takes SD cards up to 32 GB, so it's still pretty easy to get files onto any modern computer. Overall, it's actually still a pretty functional package.
The body helps make the camera usable in 2025, and the sensor can actually keep up. It's a 10.1-megapixel sensor paired with a 35-420mm equivalent lens. The lens aperture goes from f/2.8 to f/3.7, which is a reasonable expectation for the kind of camera this is. That's a whole lot of range, which is really why this camera can still be relevant compared to something like an iPhone.
In fact, during some local flooding, I put the camera through its paces as a photojournalism tool. It didn't do too badly:


And, signaling how high-end the camera was in the lineup when it was released, the camera shoots raw files, allowing for a decent amount of shadow and highlight recovery even with a small sensor.
I could easily see a reporter keeping one of these in a drawer to add easy photographs to a story that an iPhone just can't capture due to the zoom range.

In what's possibly the wildest kind of conclusion I've written for one of these look-back pieces, this camera is still actually usable in 2025. It's aged quite gracefully, and I've been using it when I know the light's going to be good and I just need the range. I have no jokes or even ways I can poke fun at this camera—it's that good.
In an age where point-and-shoot cameras have made a real comeback, perhaps it's time that Panasonic revisited this line?

If you want to try to impress people, you can buy the Leica V-LUX 1, which is the exact same camera just with different badges, and a ludicrously-inflated price because of it.
Wow, that is nuts! I just looked it up. Seems like it's as you say. I wish I could justify the ~$250 to do a head-to-head against this one. I remember a while back Sony did a similar thing with Hasselblad.
I wonder how many of these Leica ever sold.
I'd rather go for a Canon PowerShot G3X (released in 2015).
It weighs the same, but ts' smaller, has the bigger 1-inch sensor and a wider zoom range (24-600).
It doesn't have an EVF, but if that doesn't put you off, it's still a good super zoom.
PS: At mbp you can't get one in mint condition for about 580€.
Agreed - much higher price point, but much better camera with the 1"" sensor if you can swing the money. You could get an EVF for it which made it a nice little package. I used to own one, but gave it to my bird-watching cousin, which is a perfect use-case for it.
It's definitely a bit heavier than this one though."

60cm deep and more than half of that is shelf/drawer? How on earth would this be usable?
single notepad with small pencil case to the side - perfect
Screen on the raised bit and keyboard below ?
I would love to have to move my mouse and mousepad in order to open up a tiny drawer.
would have taken a lot of effort to come up with such a poor design I imagine
FYI this package is somewhere in the 30kg weight range. Its quite heavy
The targeted audience is certainly on the life style camp, not IT workers.
Basically you don't need 2 or 3 monitors and you may not even use a mouse (yes I have seen people do not use mouse, just the touch pad). Just a single laptop and be done with it, that's why the drawer is in front of the mouse and the shelf is mainly designed to store some ""books"" and flowers instead of holding multiple monitors.
