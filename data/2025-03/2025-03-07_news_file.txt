Nasdaq announced Friday that it intends to allow 24-hour trading five days a week to take advantage of investors around the world wanting to trade US markets.

        The second-largest stock exchange in the country after the New York Stock Exchange is awaiting regulatory approval for the plan, but it hopes this trading option will be available in the second half of 2026.
    

        ""We are excited to share that Nasdaq has begun engaging with regulators, market participants and other key stakeholders, with a view of enabling 24-hour trading five days a week on the Nasdaq Stock Market,"" Nasdaq's president Tal Cohen said in a blog post.
    

        ""Attracting more investment to our markets presents a compelling opportunity for both the US and global economy,"" he said. 
    

        ""It is therefore incumbent on us to enhance access for those operating across different time zones. ""
    

        Nasdaq's announcement follows the NYSE, which is part of Intercontinental Exchange, saying in October 2024 that it plans to extend weekday trading to 22 hours a day. 
    

        The Securities and Exchange Commission approved the plans in February, though the NYSE still has other regulatory hurdles to navigate before launching extended trade.
    

        Last month, Chicago-based Cboe Global Markets said it also plans to introduce a 24-hour, five-days-a-week schedule for equity trading.
    

        ""The question is not whether we can build a market that operates 24/5, but how we do so in a way that strengthens investor confidence in US capital markets today,"" Cohen said.
    

        The Nasdaq Composite was down about 2.6% on Thursday to just above 18,000, its lowest since before President Donald Trump's election, and formally in the territory of a market correction. In early trade Friday, it was virtually unchanged.

1,2025-03-07,"The jobs report arrives at a turbulent moment for U.S. stocks, trade relations.
The U.S. added fewer jobs than economists expected in February, the first full month under President Donald Trump, according to government data released on Friday.
Employers hired 151,000 workers last month, falling short of expectations of 170,000 jobs added. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.1%, which remains a historically low figure.
The stock market appeared to shrug off the solid, albeit disappointing report. Each of the three major stock indexes ticked up on Friday, recovering some of their losses a day earlier.
Hiring picked up from January but fell slightly below the average number of jobs added each month last year.
Speaking hours after the data release, Fed Chair Jerome Powell affirmed the strength of the U.S. economy.
""Despite elevated levels of uncertainty, the U.S. economy continues to be in a good place,"" Powell said at the annual U.S. Monetary Policy Forum in New York City. ""The labor market is solid.""
Employment increased in a range of sectors, including health care, social assistance and finance, data showed.
However, the federal government shed 10,000 workers in February, indicating potential impact from employee cuts initiated by the Trump administration.
The fresh jobs report arrives during a turbulent period for U.S. stocks and trade relations in the aftermath of tariffs issued by the Trump administration earlier this week.
Despite the temporary withdrawal of some tariffs on Thursday, stocks dropped as fallout from the policy continued to roil markets.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Thursday tumbled about 425 points, or 1%, while the S&P 500 fell 1.7%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 2.6%.
The tariffs stand among a flurry of economy-related directives issued since Trump took office, including spending cuts and the targeting of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.
The Trump administration has also terminated tens of thousands of federal employees, though such cuts are not expected to appear fully in the February report, in part due to the timing of surveys conducted by officials who collect the data.
Meanwhile, the economy is weathering a bout of resurgent inflation that stretches back to the final months of the Biden administration.
Consumer prices rose 3% in January compared to a year ago, registering a percentage point higher than the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%.
Egg prices, a closely watched symbol of rising costs, soared 53% in January compared to a year ago. Bird flu has decimated the egg supply, lifting prices higher.
In February, a key gauge of consumer confidence registered its largest monthly drop since August 2021, the nonpartisan Conference Board said last month.
The share of consumers who expect a recession within the next year surged to a nine-month high, the data showed. A growing portion of consumers believe the job market will worsen, the stock market will fall and interest rates will rise, the report added.
Still, some measures of consumer sentiment improved. Consumers’ assessment of current business conditions moved higher, while an uptick in purchasing plans for a home extended a monthslong recovery.
Mortgage rates have dropped for seven consecutive weeks, FreddieMac data showed. The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage stands at 6.63%, its lowest level since December.

The job market was just a touch cooler than expected in February, as new job creation clocked in at 151,000, and unemployment unexpectedly increased to 4.1%.

        The job growth forecast was 159,000, and unemployment was expected to be at the same rate as January's 4%. Unemployment has been between 4% and 4.2% since May.
    

        ""We're still very much in a bifurcated labor market where your job opportunities are going to largely depend on what type of work it is you're doing,"" Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, told Business Insider.
    

        Economic data like unemployment is useful for the Federal Reserve to determine what to do next with interest rates. The Federal Open Market Committee is meeting later this month, following their most recent decision to hold rates steady in January. Since then, two jobs reports and other data releases, such as reports about consumer confidence and prices, have given further insight into the economy's performance.
    

        ""Labor market conditions have cooled from their formerly overheated state and remain solid,"" Fed chair Jerome Powell said in the semiannual testimony before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs in February.
    

        Revisions to job growth from earlier reports were minor. January's job creation was revised from 143,000 to 125,000. December's job gain was revised from 307,000 to 323,000.
    

        Labor force participation, which includes people working or actively seeking work, dropped to 62.4% in February from 62.6% in January. The employment-population ratio decreased to 59.9% from 60.1%.
    

        Wage growth was fairly steady last month. Average hourly earnings increased 4% from a year prior, from $34.54 in February 2024 to $35.93 this past February, similar to January's year-over-year growth of 3.9%.
    

        Based on traders' expectations, CME FedWatch showed a 95%chance the Fed decides in its meeting on March 18 and 19 to do another interest-rate hold, an increase from the 91% chance before the new jobs report.
    

        ""It's a report that shows signs of softening, but not of any kind of collapse,"" Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter, said. ""Given the enduring concerns about inflation, I think this will likely be a welcome report for the Fed.""
    

        The jobs report gives people insight into which sectors have had particularly strong growth and where demand is lacking. Federal government employment fell by 10,000. While many federal agencies cut jobs in February, most of those cuts will show up in next month's report because of the timing of data collection. Still, Stahle said it is concerning that the decline is being reflected already, given that federal employment is likely going to fall even further in coming reports.
    

        Gregory Daco, EY's chief economist, told BI that the terminations of federal workers ""will undoubtedly impact the March payrolls print, but we don't know by how much."" That report will be published on the first Friday in April.
    

        Meanwhile, Stahle said there are still many job opportunities in healthcare, while software development isn't hiring a lot. Healthcare and social assistance employment increased by 63,100 in February,  and financial activities employment increased by 21,000. Manufacturing employment increased by 10,000, the first uptick for that sector since November. Employment fell in retail trade and leisure and hospitality.
    

        While economists have described the job market as strong recently and said the US hasn't entered a recession, Americans are worried about the economy.
    

        ""While headline job market measures remain strong, economic anxiety is on the rise among workers as uncertainty about inflation and job security abounds,"" Daniel Zhao, lead economist at Glassdoor, told BI before the new jobs report was published. ""The trajectory of the labor market remains highly uncertain for the rest of 2025, which is leaving workers uneasy and the picture for the overall economy murky.""
    

        Uncertainty around a potential trade war, including retaliatory tariffs, could also affect the US economy. President Donald Trump imposed new tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China earlier this week, although many of those were delayed until April 2 as of Thursday afternoon. The threat of tariffs could affect business planning and demand for workers.
    

        ""Steep tariff increases could cause adjustments in business decisions with knock-on effects on hiring and wages as business leaders navigate higher input costs and retaliatory measures,"" Lydia Boussour, senior economist at EY, said.

CFO Spencer Neumann said the streaming service is ‘just getting started.’

Netflix plans to spend around $18 billion on content this year – and chief financial officer Spencer Neumann thinks that number could increase down the line. “We are not anywhere near a ceiling,” Neumann said during the Morgan Stanley Tech, Media, and Telecom Conference this week, as reported by Variety. “I think we are still just getting started.”
Netflix’s spending has increased from $16.2 billion last year as the company continues to expand its lineup of live content with the addition of WWE’s Monday Night Raw, John Mulaney’s late-night talk show, and this summer’s live boxing match between Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano.
“We see the opportunity to grow everywhere,” Neumann said, according to Variety. “We want to stay in growth mode versus maintenance mode as long as possible.” He added that Netflix aims to deliver “more and more entertainment value per dollar.”
Earlier this year, Netflix announced yet another price hike, while its subscriber count increased to 300 million. The service still has big competition with YouTube, which has dominated Nielsen’s list of the most-watched streaming services for the past two years. Neumann said Netflix wants to tackle the part of the streaming market that “neither of us are capturing,” such as traditional TV, Variety reports.

President Donald Trump announced on Thursday that his 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada would be delayed another month, once again backtracking on his aggressive international trade policy proposals.

        Trump's repeated reversals are key to his economic strategy, though they may not pay off in the long term as they erode relationships with the nation's allies, supply chain and conflict resolution scholars told Business Insider.
    

        The continued flip-flopping has left the US economy with a sense of whiplash. Businesses and markets have to keep up with the latest policies amid a budding trade war, while uncertainty in the world's biggest economy makes waves across the rest of the globe.
    

        The tariff tension between the North American trade partners is creating diplomatic friction between the US and its allies, in addition to driving cross-industry cost increases and consumer price hikes, Nick Vyas, the founding director of the University of Southern California's Randall R. Kendrick Global Supply Chain Institute, told Business Insider.
    

        He said that's a feature of Trump's trade policy, not a bug.
    

        ""Everyone has to understand that you're on the long ride here with this jolt, this is not just turbulence for a few seconds,"" Vyas said.
    

        Since Trump prides himself on being a master dealmaker, Vyas said the president seems to believe he'll be able to achieve his policy goals by increasing the pressure on Canada and Mexico — and that means keeping each country's leader off balance at the negotiating table.
    

        ""It all fits into his America First strategy,"" Vyas said. ""But I think we're going to have to make sure that we don't alienate our allies.""
    

        While his tariff threats may be an attempt to strengthen the US' economic standing, Trump's repeated backtracking may not help the implementation of his other policy priorities in the long term, Andrea Schneider, the director of the Kukin Program for Conflict Resolution at the Cardozo School of Law, told BI.
    

        ""When you threaten and then continue to walk things back, obviously, the threat loses its power,"" Schneider said. ""Whatever strategy message we're trying to send is confusing and is less strong because of it.""
    

        Schneider said the mixed signals and confusing trade policies don't give businesses the predictability needed to make decisions like hiring, expanding research and development, or developing a new product. These factors increase market volatility, making consumers unhappy, and can drive social unrest as prices of everyday goods continue to rise.
    

        ""The world is watching. Markets are watching,"" she said. ""The chaos and unpredictability might, in certain instances, make sense in diplomatic relationships or one-on-one negotiations. But it doesn't work in a situation like this, where every US business is trying to figure out what to do tomorrow and can't predict what the policy will be.""
    

        Thursday's announcement is the second monthlong delay Trump has imposed since he signed executive orders calling for sweeping tariffs in February. The duties — including 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods and 10% on Chinese goods — went into effect on Tuesday. Energy products from Canada were also subjected to a separate 10% tariff.
    

China and Canada retaliated immediately on Tuesday with tariffs on US products. Mexico said it would follow suit on Sunday, a move that Gladys McCormick, the Moskowitz endowed chair in Mexico-US relations at Syracuse University, told BI was likely in anticipation of an enforcement delay.
    

        ""To be honest with you, I wasn't surprised, nor do I think Mexicans were surprised,"" McCormick said. ""That lag, in essence, gives the Trump administration an off-ramp to really kind of think through how catastrophically devastating this would be to both countries, not just Mexico.""
    

        Trump is playing a game of brinkmanship, or pushing a risky situation to the brink of disaster before backing down in the hopes of a positive outcome, which has been an ""intrinsic part of the Trump playbook,"" McCormick said.
    

        ""If and when Trump does follow through with tariffs, it's not going to be this sort of wholesale 25% on everything. Rather, they will ultimately end up taking a selective approach to certain industries or certain sectors,"" McCormick said. ""For example, I think that manufacturing, and then especially the automobile industry, would be so severely hard hit on both sides of the border that that's going to be off the table.""
    

        In the meantime, the US and its major trading partners are stuck in a battle of wills instigated by Trump. The president has repeatedly said the duties will help drive down immigration and fentanyl flowing across US borders. However, Christopher Tang, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles and scholar of global supply chain management, told BI he isn't convinced that's Trump's primary goal.
    

        ""Trump claimed that this tariff is a penalty for Canada and Mexico for not doing enough to curb illegal immigration and illegal drug trade,"" Tang said. However, he added that the rates of crossings for both migrants and drugs are down at both borders, so he thinks that rationale is ""an excuse.""
    

        Instead, Tang said he believes Trump's tariffs are more likely an attempt to ""close the backdoor"" for Chinese products using Mexico as a transition point to avoid tariffs. China has used Mexico as a workaround to avoid tariffs by shipping the parts or semi-finished products — like furniture — to Mexico, performing final assembly in Mexico, and then shipping the finished goods to the US without paying its own tariffs, Tang said.
    

        ""If the goal is to close the backdoor for importing Chinese goods without paying tariffs, it can be effective, but the implementation can be complicated due to the mass volume and limited manpower,"" Tang said. ""If the goal is to nudge Canada and Mexico to expand its control of illegal immigrants and illegal drugs, only time will tell.""
    

        Mexico, in particular, has already spent years addressing both problems by sending its National Guard to the Mexican-US border to cut off immigrants and working to shutter fentanyl labs in the nation, McCormick, the Syracuse University professor, said. She added that the demands from the Trump administration have been ""vague,"" which has been ""worrisome"" to those who wonder when enough will be enough.
    

        ""The absence of metrics suggests that this is not about fentanyl and it's not about immigration. This is very much about political theater,"" McCormick said.

11,2025-03-07,"Well, look at that. AMD actually released a graphics cards that was competitive on price, performance, and features with Nvidia. And it managed to keep enough cards in stock for the launch that it wasn’t immediately ruined by scalpers. Although that might seem like a low bar to reach, it’s what passes for a success story for GPU launches in 2025, because Nvidia’s has been one of the worst we’ve ever seen.
As exciting as it is that there’s a new graphics card that’s actually kind of good and worth paying money for, though, it’s not time for AMD (or fans) to rest on their laurels. There’s more to push for: most notably that prices should come down further.
The RX 9070 XT is an awesome graphics card — one of the best in a long time. It offers 5070 Ti/4080 performance for $600-ish, and its feature set is great, too. The RX 9070, though? It’s a good card, with 5070-like performance, 16GB of VRAM, and similarly strong features. But its price is only $50 less than the base 9070 XT price. That’s far, far too close.
This is the same weird pricing choice AMD made with the RX 7900 XT last generation. With just $100 between it and the 7900 XTX, and a much greater gap in performance, the XT model made no sense. It was only later when AMD dropped the price that it became a particularly great value option.
AMD should end up doing the same with the 9070 (non-XT), but we need to make sure it does. Margins and margins and they’re typically not great with graphics cards, but come on AMD. Drop it down to sub $500 and really put the boot in to Nvidia’s gouging.
Nvidia needs to step up now. It might still be the king in performance and DLSS might still be a bit better than FSR4, but that’s not the win it used to be. Especially when it just doesn’t really have any graphics cards to sell at the moment. There are models, there are listings at retailers, but none of them are in stock and the second-hand market is a mess (and AMD might upend that soon, too).
Nvidia will need to lower the prices of its 5070 and 5070 Ti if it wants to remain competitive with AMD, and get more of the cards in stock in much greater numbers. That will likely happen in the next few months, but the price cuts will only come if people put their money where there mouth is and buy AMD’s new cards. Again, that’ll likely happen as the reviews are strong and stock is there, but that momentum needs to be maintained.
If Nvidia’s cards come back close enough to MSRP, they’re still too expensive: The 5070 Ti in particular. Hopefully Nvidia sees the writing on the wall after a few weeks of high 9070 XT sales and realises multiple frame generation alone isn’t going to be enough to save the 50-series.
We need to then continue that momentum forward into the rest of this generation and the next. Graphics card prices have grown dramatically in recent years, and though inflation and tariffs can be blamed for some of it, there’s also Nvidia’s sheer greed at play — and AMD has been just as guilty when it’s had market dominance with CPUs.
PC gaming is always going to be that bit more expensive than console gaming, but no one should be forced to spend $500+ on a graphics card to get something that can play the latest games at 4K resolution. That’s more than the entire price of a full console, even before factoring in the added cost of a monitor and all the additional peripherals.
Halo products like the RTX 5090 are always going to be ridiculous, and to some extent they should be. For those on mega bucks there isn’t much of a difference between spending $1,500 and $2,000. But for everyone else, there needs to be better options for affordable, high-fidelity PC gaming.
Intel is handling the super-entry level portion of the market, AMD’s done the right thing with its 9070 XT, but I’d still like to see the 9070 sub-$500 before long, and the 9060 needs to be the darling $300 card we all know it wants to be.
That might be wishful thinking, but once Nvidia’s AI-hype-gravy-train starts to hit reality and that bubble pops, it might need to remember its roots and start selling gamers GPUs that are more than just marketing spin and a high price tags.
AMD finally shared technical specifications and pricing for its latest RDNA 4-based Radeon RX 9070 series GPUs. After a rather dull announcement at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES), the company today hosted a special online event where it spoke about architectural details and new features that we can expect from the RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT graphics cards.
Alongside the launch of the Radeon RX 9000 series, AMD also announced key updates to its upscaling and performance-boosting technologies. FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) 4 represents a significant shift in AMD’s approach to image upscaling and frame generation, while HYPR-RX receives refinements to further optimize gaming performance.
After a long wait, the future of AMD's best graphics cards is finally here. The company just announced the RX 9000 series, comprised of two new GPUs: The RX 9070 XT and the RX 9070. Both are set to launch on March 6 at $599 and $549, respectively. If AMD lives up to the expectations performance-wise, these GPUs might be an absolute mainstream hit.
AMD's focus throughout the presentation was the fact that gamers buy mainstream GPUs more often than behemoths along the lines of the RTX 5090. To that end, AMD cited its own research, saying that 85% of gamers buy GPUs that cost less than $700. At the same time, higher resolutions are slowly becoming mainstream, with more and more people buying 1440p and 4K monitors. The needs of gamers have gone up, now including solid performance in ray tracing, but keeping it affordable is important too.
Although still yet to be announced, Nvidia's RTX 5060 Ti is coming -- and according to leakers, it's coming soon. The card is said to be launching in two different models, much like the RTX 4060 Ti. However, the RTX 40-series equivalent really struggled to find its place among the best graphics cards.
I've been keeping tabs on various leaks related to the RTX 5060 Ti, and although there are some good news, it does seem that Nvidia is essentially creating an updated carbon copy of the RTX 4060 Ti. If there's one party that will benefit from such a decision, it's AMD with its competing graphics cards. For gamers, the RTX 5060 Ti might end up being a GPU that sounds great on paper but comes with its own challenges.
The RTX 5060 Ti will have a lot in common with its predecessor

12,2025-03-07,"King Charles III is launching a personal playlist of music that lifts his spirits and brings back important memories, including Bob Marley, Kylie Minogue and Grace Jones.
He was photographed at Buckingham Palace for the music project, named the King's Music Room, with an ""on air"" sign on the desk of the royal DJ.
A video trailer shows the band for the changing of the guard outside the palace playing Bob Marley's Could You Be Loved, in a project to celebrate music from Commonwealth countries.
""So this is what I particularly wanted to share - songs which have brought me joy,""  the King said.
""Throughout my life, music has meant a great deal to me,"" the King says in the video launching the project, which is a partnership with Apple Music.
""I know that is also the case for so many others. 
""It has that remarkable ability to bring happy memories flooding back from the deepest recesses of our memory, to comfort us in times of sadness, and to take us to distant places.
""But perhaps, above all, it can lift our spirits to such a degree, and all the more so when it brings us together in celebration. 
""In other words, it brings us joy."" 
The full choice of tracks, with more royal commentary, will be published on Monday, for Commonwealth Day.
As well as as reggae from Marley and dance music from Minogue, there are expected to be contributions from Nigerian-American singer-songwriter Davido and British singer-songwriter Raye.
The King saw Raye at a concert at a Christmas market at the former Battersea Power Station, where Apple has its London headquarters.
The project is intended to be a different approach to Commonwealth Day, which sees the Royal Family gathering for a service in Westminster Abbey.
It will reflect the King's musical interests through his life, ranging from 1930s crooners to Afrobeat stars. 
He is also expected to share anecdotes about some of the artists and reveals why the songs help form the soundtrack to his life.
""This seemed such an interesting and innovative way to celebrate this year's Commonwealth Day,"" the King said.
He has a longstanding interest in Marley and has visited the singer's former home in Jamaica, which has been turned into a museum.
And outside the palace windows, the band played Marley's message: ""Don't let them change ya, oh! Or even rearrange ya! Oh, no!""

With MWC 2025 wrapped up, it’s time to take stock of all the tech treats launched this week. Right at the start of the global event, Nothing revealed its 2025 contenders for the mid-range smartphone market. Don’t let that category fool you, though, because, with the fast-paced development of mobile technology, the lines between tiers have gotten a bit blurry. Add that to the fact that Nothing launched two models, it’s pretty understandable to be more than just a little confused.
It’s only too easy to underestimate the Nothing Phone (3a) since it doesn’t have a Pro in its name. After all, that’s how our brains have been trained to think by highly effective marketing campaigns. That’s why we had to take a closer look at the Phone (3a) to see if it’s even worth considering in the face of the mighty Nothing Phone (3a) Pro. And truth be told, the competition is quite neck and neck.
Designer: Nothing
The design of the Nothing Phone (3a) is a bit of a mixed bag, even considering fans of the brand’s unique Tron-esque aesthetic. Nothing Phones have always had a distinctive and somewhat divisive flavor to them, and that is best seen in the Phone (3a) Pro’s camera design. In contrast, the Phone (3a) seems almost like a copy of the Phone (2a), and that’s actually the best part about it.

Although the camera array has been expanded, the overall design of the Phone (3a) is familiar and reassuring. Fans of this design need not fear the huge yet controversial change of the Pro version, allowing them to enjoy the simpler and more minimalist character of this design. You can almost call it an underdog because it’s easy for others to dismiss it from the way it looks, while you silently laugh at their misguided ignorance.
Of course, Nothing did make some changes to the Phone (3a), almost all of them for the better. The back panel, for example, has been upgraded from polycarbonate to glass, giving it a more reflective sheen and a more sophisticated look. The mid-frame is still the same plastic, though, but you wouldn’t be able to tell at a glance. The Glyph Interface is still there, as is the translucent aesthetic, giving a sense of confidence and reliability from a design that has been tried and tested over time.
Sticking to the same design, despite the additional camera, proves to also be beneficial to the phone’s ergonomics. With a ginormous camera bump, the phone is lighter and easier to hold. It isn’t as top-heavy as the Nothing Phone (3a) Pro, inspiring that same confidence. That said, the switch to glass material could be its downfall for some owners whose hands find it too slippery for comfort.






Thankfully, the design’s flat edges deliver that grip you need to hold the phone tightly. Some people are not a fan of how that cuts into your palm, though, but it’s also a personal matter at best. The side edges’ material also adds some texture to further improve the phone’s ergonomics, making the Nothing Phone (3a) a true delight to hold.
Despite looking like the Phone (2a) on the outside, the Nothing Phone (3a) is nothing like it on the inside. The company has made improvements in areas where they matter the most, starting with the newer Snapdragon 7s Gen 3. It’s no premium silicon, of course, but it balances performance and power efficiency with distinction. Paired with 12GB of RAM, it won’t choke on most of the tasks you throw at it. It will struggle with games a bit unless you dial down the effects, but it will definitely serve nicely as a gaming phone with the right settings.






The already decent display of its predecessor gets a huge bump in max brightness, boasting 3,000 nits of brightness when playing HDR content. Of course, that’s only in the best-case scenario, but an auto-brightness of 1,300 nits is definitely plenty already. Needless to say, the Phone (3a) packs quite a punch with its vibrant and immersive 6.77-inch 120Hz AMOLED screen, making your content pop whether displaying static images or moving pictures.

The battery is another area where the Phone (3a) gets an update, but not in its capacity. The charging speed now reaches 50W, up from 45W, which means your charging downtime will be shorter, about less than an hour from zero to full. Given how the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 isn’t as power-hungry as higher-end chipsets, you won’t be eating through that battery quickly anyway. Sadly, Nothing continues to withhold wireless charging from its mid-range phones, something we hope will change in the next iteration.

Things get a little bit spicy when it comes to the cameras. Nothing added a new member to the team in the form of a 50MP telephoto camera with a 50mm equivalent focal length. It’s capable of 2x optical zoom and 4x lossless in-sensor zoom, which is, again, a bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, it’s definitely better than a cropped 2x zoom without a telephoto camera, but on the other hand, it also falls short of what the Phone (3a) Pro offers with its periscope camera. Mind you, the difference in output isn’t night and day, but if you’re a fan of close-up shots, you might come off disappointed.







More disappointing, however, is how the Phone (3a) sacrificed its ultra-wide capabilities for this newcomer. Down from 50MP, the 120-degree shooter now only has an 8MP sensor. You’ll definitely be able to tell how the image quality is only “passable” in ultra-wide shots, but thankfully it isn’t that terrible either. This is the one area where Nothing clearly had to cut corners, whether it was to provide a lower price point or to keep the design slim.

The good news is that, in most cases, the Nothing Phone (3a) performs quite well in the photography department. Even on overcast days, it manages to deliver crisp and detailed photos with colors that lean more toward realism than saturation. As mentioned, ultra-wide shots are decent but stop there, and you might be tempted to just use the main 50MP camera for wide shots anyway.
As with any modern smartphone these days, the Phone (3a) has been enhanced with some AI functionality. It’s called “Essential Space,” perhaps a nod to the short-lived phone brand that the company acquired a few years back, and its purpose is a little more constrained than other AI-powered features on other phones. It basically collates and organizes photos, screenshots, and voice notes, almost like a note-taking AI assistant. It’s still a bit basic at the moment, but it’s still in its early days. It will definitely be interesting to see where Nothing takes it and if it can do something more with it.

As part of its revolutionary character, Nothing has always been quite vocal about its role in protecting the planet for future generations. The Nothing Phone (3a) is no different and is, in fact, a step up above its own kin with a carbon footprint of 51.3kg CO2e, the lowest of any Nothing phone. It also boasts of using 100% recycled aluminum for its mid-frame, making sure that over 60% of its plastic parts are sustainably sourced, and using 100% plastic-free packaging.
Nothing has also made sure that the Phone (3a) is longer lasting, delaying any trip to landfills or recycling centers. Now flaunting an IP64 dust and water resistance, it can withstand more accidents. One area of its longevity we’d like to see improved, however, is the length of software updates. Currently, only three years of Android updates are promised, but it’s not clear whether that includes Android 16 this year, since the phone is only launching with Android 15 out of the box.

The Nothing Phone (3a)’s solid mix of performance, design, and a $379 price tag easily marks it as a cut above the rest. Curiously, its biggest rival isn’t other phones from competing brands but its own sibling, the Phone (3a) Pro. With many things in common, it might even be confusing why Nothing has two models on this tier. At the end of the day, however, the answer all boils down to whether you think the Pro’s added features are worth that $80.
The Nothing (3a) Pro definitely has the advantage when it comes to photography. The 50MP main sensor has a bigger full well capacity that lets it take in more light, and the periscope telephoto camera clearly outshines one without. It comes at the cost of not only a higher price tag but also a design that might not be to everyone’s tastes. The Pro’s front camera has also been bumped up to 50MP, but it might not be that noticeable except to avid selfie-takers and live streamers. If none of these sing to your heart, you might still be better off with the Nothing (3a).

While the first Nothing Phone turned heads with its distinctive design and Glyph Interface gimmick, the brand has made a name for itself with its blend of well-thought design, impressive performance, and competitive pricing. Nowhere is there truer than with Nothing’s “a” series that continues to shake up the mid-range smartphone market, especially with the arrival of the Phone (3a).
It might not look like a significant upgrade from the outside, but Nothing combines a familiar and trusted design with improvements across the board, prioritizing reliability over fancy new designs and features. The best part is that it comes with a price tag that almost makes it feel like a steal. The Nothing Phone (3a) is definitely something you should consider for your next purchase if you’re in the market for a solid all-rounder that won’t burn a hole through your wallet.

In the ever-changing e-commerce landscape, companies must find a way to be more efficient, competitive, and nimble. And unsurprisingly, some small businesses are turning to AI for help.

Amarra, a company that manufactures and wholesales special-occasion gowns and dresses — including for weddings and quinceaeras — has integrated AI tools into its operations since 2020. Artificial intelligence has helped the company's leaders better understand customer needs and increase efficiency across such tasks as writing product descriptions and inventory management, Kunal Madan, Amarra's cofounder, said.
    

        ""The primary motivation was to enhance efficiency and elevate the customer experience,"" Madan said in an email interview. ""E-commerce is a highly competitive field, and leveraging AI allowed us to optimize how we manage inventory, create content, and interact with our customers — which markedly improved our overall performance.""
    

        The company, which is headquartered in New Jersey and wholesales its products to more than 800 independent retailers worldwide, uses AI to optimize its marketing and customer service operations and analyze market trends. Amarra launched in 2018 with just two employees, up to 25 today.
    

        Amarra uses ChatGPT, a generative-AI assistant, to write product descriptions. The team inputs information on product features and unique selling points into the chatbot, which then produces an initial draft of each blurb. From there, the team refines the text to align with its brand voice.
    

        Its website showcases dresses by color, silhouette, or occasion, each with a multisentence description designed to get a retailer to buy them. Terms for a neon pink ball-gown-style dress include ""whimsical"" and ""fairytale-inspired."" Other blurbs reference floral appliqus and stone accents — all written with the help of ChatGPT.
    

        Amarra's ChatGPT use, Madan said, has cut down content creation time by 60%, with no loss in quality.
    

        The company also uses an AI-powered inventory management system that predicts stock needs based on historical data and seasonal trends. The tool has reduced overstocking by 40%, Madan said, and has helped Amarra avoid selling out of popular items. This allows the company to ensure product availability for the bridal shops, boutiques, and other independent retailers in North America, Europe, the UK, and Australia that purchase its dresses.
    

        Amarra also uses AI to analyze customer review data across platforms, which helps it better understand shifts in buying behaviors and consumer preferences.
    

        ""This helps us identify emerging trends and opportunities for product improvement, keeping us ahead in the market,"" Madan said.
    

        AI drives Amarra's customer service operations, too. The company said that AI chatbots now handle 70% of customer inquiries, answering basic or commonly asked questions and providing faster responses. Madan said this freed up Amarra's team to focus on more complex issues, such as product customization requests and resolving intricate customer payment issues.
    

        Though AI-driven innovations have allowed Amarra to streamline its operations, adopting the technology hasn't been entirely smooth.
    

        Madan said one of his team's biggest challenges with using AI had been ""achieving the right balance between automation and the human touch."" For example, Amarra's chatbot initially provided rigid, impersonal responses to customers.
    

        ""We've since refined these to better reflect our brand personality, improving the overall customer experience,"" he said.
    

        Merging AI systems with Amarra's existing tools and processes and managing the biases in AI models have been two other challenges. For example, the company's chatbots initially didn't account for cultural nuances in different markets, leading to occasional misinterpretations.
    

        It has also seen biases in product recommendations, such as AI favoring certain items without considering newer inventory. Madan said ""constant tweaking"" helped mitigate these issues. But it's an ongoing process to address the biases and seamlessly integrate Amarra's technology environment while keeping data secure.
    

        To ensure responsible AI use, the company actively involves its employees in implementing and customizing the tools. Madan said the collaboration helped Amarra maintain a balance between AI-led automation and human oversight. The company also regularly trains its workers to use AI effectively in their everyday work, he said.
    

        ""We focus on using AI to augment our employees' capabilities, rather than replace their roles,"" he said. ""AI handles repetitive tasks, allowing our team to invest more time in creative and strategic functions that require a human touch.""
    

        Amarra has learned a lot as it has tested and adapted its AI use over the past half decade. Madan's advice for other small businesses embarking on a similar journey is to focus on good data management practices since data is the foundation of AI models and algorithms.
    

        They also should consider starting with very specific, manageable areas where AI can have the most impact, such as customer support or inventory management, he added. Any functions should be flexible enough to adapt to changing business and operational demands, while staying true to the company's ethos.
    

        ""Be prepared for a learning curve,"" he said. ""Some initial hiccups are normal, but iterating based on feedback leads to better outcomes.""

Hidden inside an unassuming office building in Taipei, the Taiwan Stock Museum sits within a former high-security vault, a fitting home for a collection that preserves Taiwan’s financial history. Unlike conventional museums, this space provides an in-depth look at stock certificates, securities trading, and the evolution of Taiwan’s stock market.
The museum’s collection includes a range of historically significant stock certificates, from the earliest paper stocks issued in Taiwan to the highest face-value stock certificate ever printed—a Chunghwa Telecom share worth NT$281 billion. These artifacts illustrate the development of Taiwan’s economy and the transition from physical stock certificates to fully digital transactions.
Beyond stock memorabilia, the museum serves as an educational resource for student groups and financial enthusiasts. Exhibits include interactive displays on Taiwan’s securities depository process that explain how shares are stored, transferred, and safeguarded. Visitors can also test their knowledge about the stock market through interactive games.
Despite its compact size, the Taiwan Stock Museum presents a compelling narrative of Taiwan’s financial history and economic development. The Taiwan Stock Exchange was established in 1961, when Taiwan’s GDP per capita was less than $200. Today, Taiwan’s GDP per capita exceeds $30,000, and its stock market sometimes ranks among the top ten in the world by market value. The museum requires reservations, so plan ahead before visiting.

Wall Street heavyweights are vying to become the next Warren Buffett — or at least build their own versions of Berkshire Hathaway. Pulling pages from the Buffett playbook is one thing — having the smarts, patience, and discipline to succeed is another.

        The legendary investor and Berkshire CEO turned a failing textile mill into one of the world's biggest companies in part by acquiring insurers such as GEICO and National Indemnity.
    

        Buffett took their ""float,"" or the difference between the premiums they collected and the claims they paid out, and used it to buy stocks and make acquisitions.
    

        The strategy spared Buffett and his team from having to raise money from outside investors and then feeling pressure to deliver a return to them in a few years.
    

        Instead, they could be patient and prudent, only buying when the price was right, and purchasing businesses intending to own them forever — not strip them for parts or flip them for a profit.
    

        Berkshire's access to ""permanent capital"" has made it the envy of the financial world. It's also structured as a vast web of decentralized, autonomous subsidiaries, enabling Buffett to run a company with nearly 400,000 employees while only having a couple dozen staff at its Omaha headquarters.
    

        ""We delegate almost to the point of abdication,"" Buffett wrote in his ""Owner's Manual"" for Berkshire shareholders. By trusting day-to-day responsibilities to an army of CEOs, the investor is free to focus on the critical task of deploying capital within and outside the company.
    

        Berkshire's float-fueled model ""enables optimal capital allocation across multiple alternatives — acquiring or reinvesting in majority-owned businesses, public equities, fixed income, share buybacks, and more,"" Larry Cunningham, the director of the University of Delaware's Weinberg Center on Corporate Governance and the author of several books about Buffett and Berkshire, told Business Insider.
    

        ""The scope for conferring autonomy, decentralization, and permanence adds more value,"" Cunningham said. ""It does require both intelligence and patience, which are scarce resources.""
    

        When KKR co-CEOs Joseph Bae and Scott Nuttall first joined the private equity giant in 1996, Berkshire was worth about $40 billion.
    

        ""You fast-forward 28 years, they have a trillion-dollar market cap on the back of long-term compounding of their balance sheet and their investments,"" Bae said at the Bloomberg Invest conference in New York on Wednesday. ""Some version of that is what we're going to be doing at Strategic Holdings.""
    

        KKR manages about $650 billion of assets in its core business and owns the life insurer Global Atlantic, which has another $190 billion or so of assets under management. Last year, it introduced a third division, Strategic Holdings, which Bae hoped would become ""in some ways a mini Berkshire Hathaway.""
    

        The new segment owns large stakes in 18 businesses that Bae and his team view as highly defensive with healthy long-term growth potential, and which they expect to own ""literally forever.""
    

        KKR plans to invest its free cash flow in more of these kinds of ventures, spanning not just private equity but other sectors and real assets such as infrastructure, Bae said.
    

        Speaking at the same summit on Wednesday, Brookfield CEO Bruce Flatt said his company's insurance business could eventually own its $1 trillion asset management arm and its investment operations, ""which is really what Berkshire Hathaway is.""
    

        Flatt added that Brookfield's ""special ingredient"" is its $150 billion of capital that it can use to grow its insurance arm, invest in other divisions, or fund stock buybacks over the next 20 years.
    

        ""The attraction to investing inside an insurance company is the zero cost of float. It is effectively a margin account with zero interest,"" Bill Smead, the founder and chief investment officer of Smead Capital Management, told BI.
    

        ""These companies are increasingly looking to invest in long-duration, illiquid assets, in things like infrastructure and private credit, where the prices are not printed each day in the newspaper,"" Smead continued, adding that ""long-duration assets are best suited to compound on the balance sheet rather than in a fixed-period fund.""
    

        Apollo Global Management's CEO and cofounder, Marc Rowan, has also emulated the ""Oracle of Omaha"" in using insurance to finance investments.
    

        ""There are elements of Berkshire Hathaway,"" Rowan said about the private equity titan's takeover of Athene, a specialist in annuities and life insurance, in March 2021.
    

        Rowan's cofounder, Joshua Harris, said on an earnings call in 2019: ""Next to Berkshire Hathaway, we have the largest amount of permanent capital out there in this business."" Harris also described Apollo as an ""asset-light Berkshire Hathaway"" at a forum in 2020.
    

        ""It's not surprising to see others try to emulate Berkshire — after all, Berkshire has proven to those paying attention that these concepts work,"" Adam Mead, the author of ""The Complete Financial History of Berkshire Hathaway,"" told BI.
    

        At 94, Buffett is nearing the end of his career, which could leave room for a new generation of permanent-capital allocators. But ""it's one thing to buy forever. It's quite another to buy and leave largely alone like the Berkshire model,"" Mead said.
    

        ""I'd be surprised if these 'newcomers' to the Berkshire way of buying for keeps can resist meddling with management or business models,"" he added.

Over their 8-year career, Pompeak’s developed this incredible ability to deliver dapper timekeeping without the hefty price tag. Founded by two brothers, David & Noah Pomphrey, Pompeak’s mission has always been to make haute horologie accessible to anyone on a budget. Over the years, the company has honed its style, cutting its teeth on gentleman watches, divers, and now, their take on the ultimate dress watch. Classy enough to be worn in the boardroom, yet built to be anything but fragile. Meet the Mallory – a watch that’s classically British on the outside, with a Swiss beating heart on the inside.
Named after British explorer George Mallory, the collection, which has been over three years in the making, embodies his fearless spirit and relentless pursuit of excellence. While its aesthetic leans toward the traditional dress watch, its specifications tell a different story. Beneath the polished 40 mm stainless steel case beats a Sellita SW260-1 movement, a high-grade Swiss automatic caliber known for its reliability and precision. This movement, often found in watches commanding far higher price tags, features hacking, hand-winding, a quick-set date function, and an impressive 41-hour power reserve. Pompeak has gone a step further by offering beautiful decoration and the Elabore execution as standard, elevating accuracy to within plus or minus 7 seconds per day — an exceptional feat at this price point.
Designer: Pompeak Watches

Refined Craftsmanship is the Mallory watch’s running theme. Pompeak offers three variations, each bringing a distinct character to the collection. The timeless white dial, with heat-blued hands, exudes traditional elegance, reminiscent of vintage dress watches from the golden age of horology. The British racing green dial, with a rich fumé effect that darkens toward the edges, delivers a more contemporary yet equally sophisticated look that embraces Pompeak’s British roots. For those who prefer a bolder statement, the vibrant orange crush dial offers an energetic contrast without straying into excess. Each intricately textured dial is adorned with applied indices, with Roman numerals at 3, 6, 9, and 12 providing a timeless aesthetic. The sub-seconds register, positioned above 6 o’clock, adds a layer of complexity while maintaining symmetry and balance.



The movement itself is a spectacle. Through the sapphire exhibition case back, the rhodium-plated bridges, blued screws, and intricate finishing add a layer of artistry that’s rarely seen in watches under £1,000. The signed rotor design enhances the visual appeal, reinforcing that this isn’t just a timekeeping instrument but a celebration of fine watchmaking.

Despite its dress watch DNA, the Mallory Collection embraces practicality and a penchant for outdoor adventure, like its namesake. A 100-meter water resistance rating, secured by a screw-down crown, is a rarity in this category, ensuring peace of mind in everyday wear. Sapphire crystal—used on both the front and back—offers scratch resistance and durability, while an anti-reflective coating enhances legibility in varying lighting conditions. Even the lume, often overlooked in dress watches, has been given careful attention. Pompeak has opted for BGW9 Super-LumiNova, delivering a crisp white appearance in daylight and a striking mint-blue glow in the dark. Whether at a formal event or an evening out, the Mallory remains effortlessly readable.

The case design strikes a balance between presence and wearability. At 40mm in diameter and just 11mm thick, it sits comfortably on the wrist, its curved lugs ensuring a seamless fit. The perfectly polished surfaces enhance the visual appeal, adding depth to the design. The choice of straps further enhances its versatility. A top-grain leather strap provides a classic touch, while a Milanese mesh band introduces a modern edge. Quick-release pins allow for effortless swapping, making it easy to adapt the watch to different occasions.


Pompeak’s decision to launch the Mallory Collection via Kickstarter offers enthusiasts an opportunity to secure this Swiss-powered timepiece at an unbeatable early bird price of £584—a significant saving on its future retail price. Given the specifications, finishing, and attention to detail, this represents remarkable value in today’s watch market.



The Mallory collection delivers everything one could want in a refined automatic timepiece—precision, elegance, durability, and a touch of heritage. Whether paired with a suit or dressed down for a casual outing, it’s the kind of watch that feels right in any setting. The watch collection starts at £584 ($737 USD), a fraction of what you’d otherwise pay a luxury brand for a similar Swiss-made movement. The Mallory ships globally starting June 2025.

    From Barbie to Barcelona for Mobile World Congress 2025 -- Finnish phone-maker HMD knows how to appeal to music lovers, football fans and teens.
  
HMD brought a plethora of new phones to MWC 2025.
Hot on the heels of last year's Barbie flip phone, HMD is back with more niche phones to appeal to those whose preferences and needs fall outside the regular iPhone/Android flagship binary.
Some companies rocked up at Mobile World Congress 2025 here in Barcelona with no new phones to show off -- but not HMD. It brought its A-game to the mobile show, with a shed-load of fresh products.
HMD, short for Human Mobile Devices, is best known for making Nokia phones. Perhaps it's no surprise that the company is once again releasing an update of the classic Nokia phone -- the 3210 -- but this time in the colors of Barcelona Football Club.

HMD's partnership with Barcelona has resulted in a number of special edition phones.
The company has an ongoing partnership with the elite European soccer team, announcing its first FC Barcelona-themed device last year. This latest update to the 3210 includes hidden messages from players, custom wallpapers and the classic mobile game Snake, this time played on a football pitch. I took it for a whirl at HMD's launch event at Barcelona's Camp Nou Stadium, and it turns out I'm just as bad as ever at the simple but addictive game.
The HMD Barça Fusion, meanwhile, is a collector's edition smartphone engraved with the signatures of 11 of the club's star players. HMD also promises Easter eggs that will appeal to fans, and you can even be woken up by the voice of one of your favorite players in the morning.
The HMD Barça 3210 will cost £79 in the UK (around $100 converted), and the HMD Barça Fusion will cost £229 ($290), with exact availability dates and countries still to be confirmed.

Not a Barcelona fan? One of HMD's other phones might be a better fit for you. The Fusion X1 is the company's first smartphone for teens, created off the back of its Better Phones Project -- an effort to bring families into the process of designing devices.
The Fusion X1 allows parents control over kids' phones with a monthly Xplora subscription. This allows parents to control internet browsing and social media, in addition to a School Mode. The subscription also provides continuous location tracking at 20-second intervals with safe zones, emergency SOS calling, low battery alerts and remote device access -- your teen will be thrilled. The Fusion X1 is available for preorder now for £229 ($290) and will be available from May.
The Fusion X1 is a smartphone, but HMD is best known for making feature phones. The feature phone market is declining, but the company says it has defied the overall trend, and last year, it not only gained market share but saw double-digit growth. No wonder, then, that it's back at the show this year with a handful of feature phones.

Along with the HMD 2660 -- a classic flip phone -- the company unveiled two phones for music lovers. The big selling point of the HMD 150 and 350 is their retro feel, combined with prominent speakers, FM radios and long battery lives make them feel like the perfect festival phones. Let's just hope no one uses those statement speakers to play music on public transport.
The HMD 2660 is available now for the low price of £69 ($90), and the HMD 350 and 150 will cost even less, at just £29 ($40).

JNJ Stock 
 
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stock is up 15% this year, significantly outperforming the broader S&P 500 index, which is down 1%. This performance gap can be attributed to market volatility, with investors concerned about Trump’s recent tariff policies and their potential impact on inflation and the economy. During uncertain times, investors typically seek defensive investments like pharmaceutical companies. J&J stands out as an industry leader and offers an attractive dividend yield of nearly 3%. For a comprehensive analysis on current risks, including the effects of tariffs on the broader market, please refer to our detailed report on market crash risk right now.
After its recent rise, JNJ stock looks fairly priced - making it an ambivalent pick to buy at its current price of around $165. We believe there are some minor concerns with JNJ stock, which makes it fairly priced given that its current valuation looks high. As an aside, with earnings approaching, see How Vail Resorts Stock Might React To Upcoming Earnings?
 We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of JNJ stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Johnson & Johnson along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. However, if you seek upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception.
Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, JNJ stock looks slightly expensive compared to the broader market.

While it doesn’t look like there is much upside to JNJ stock, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid- and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

20,2025-03-07,A sharp decline for Tesla stock has one of its biggest supporters on Wall Street defending the company as other analysts have tempered their optimism.
21,2025-03-07,"After the way Nvidia’s RTX 50-series ended up being called a “paper launch,” many breathed a sigh of relief when AMD’s RX 9000 series appeared on the shelves in much larger quantities. However, once this initial shipment is sold, AMD could face the same problem as the rest of the best graphics cards: Price hikes, price hikes everywhere.
The cards officially hit the shelves yesterday, and many were spotted far above the recommended list price (MSRP), with some overclocked models priced at up to $250 more than the $600 starting price. However, AMD spoke several times about working with its partners to ensure wide availability at MSRP, and indeed, many retailers had some models up for sale. Those MSRP cards were only around for a short time, though, and they might never come back, according to retailers.
As spotted by VideoCardz, two popular European retailers both say that the price of AMD’s latest GPUs will go up once the MSRP models all sell out. Inet.se, a Swedish retail chain, says that only the first shipment of cards will be sold at MSRP.
There appears to be some difference between different manufacturers, as the retailer only received one shipment of Asus and Sapphire GPUs, and customers can buy those cards until they’re all sold out. The retailer already has a second shipment of PowerColor waiting, though, and those cards will already be sold at a markup once the initial batch is all gone.
Meanwhile, Overclockers UK reveals that it has thousands of various RX 9070 XT cards in stock, but at some point, the prices will increase. “MSRP is capped in quantity of a few hundred, so prices will jump once those are sold through,” said the retailer. “Re-stocks and pricing are unknown going forward; nobody really knows what April will bring.”
While frustrating, this isn’t unusual. If this is true for all retailers — which we don’t know for a fact — it simply means that AMD went out of its way to ensure availability at MSRP, but not forever. The GPU market is in a rough state right now, with most new GPUs constantly sold out, so price increases are, unfortunately, not unexpected.
As of right now, checking some of the most popular U.S. retailers reveals that this launch had been largely successful for AMD. The RX 9000 series is sold out at Newegg and Amazon.
Well, look at that. AMD actually released a graphics cards that was competitive on price, performance, and features with Nvidia. And it managed to keep enough cards in stock for the launch that it wasn't immediately ruined by scalpers. Although that might seem like a low bar to reach, it's what passes for a success story for GPU launches in 2025, because Nvidia's has been one of the worst we've ever seen.
As exciting as it is that there's a new graphics card that's actually kind of good and worth paying money for, though, it's not time for AMD (or fans) to rest on their laurels. There's more to push for: most notably that prices should come down further.
The RX 9070 is still too expensive
AMD is joining the battle against some of Nvidia's best graphics cards. The RX 9070 XT and its non-XT counterpart should now (hopefully) start flooding the shelves, and gamers are hoping to see them at their recommended list price (MSRP). Unfortunately, some models may cost up to $250 more from the get-go, which is similar to all of Nvidia's recent RTX 50-series releases where the GPUs cost much more than they should.
Although the cards aren't technically up for sale just yet, Best Buy seems to have plenty of RX 9070 XT and non-XT models listed -- they're just marked as ""coming soon.""
I know, I know we're all hopped up about the RX 9070 XT and 9070 launch -- I know I am. But looking beyond the potential big win AMD is on for with its first RDNA4 graphics cards, I'm also particularly excited about the potential for the rumored 9060 XT. Not because it'll be cheaper again -- it will be -- but because it might have up to 16GB of VRAM. That's going to wreck Nvidia's long-term second-hand card market, which could have a much greater impact on AMD's market share over the long term.
It's all just rumors for now, and some of my colleagues are much less excited by this than I am, but I think there's some real potential here for this little card to be a game changer.
Hitting the VRAM wall
Video memory, or VRAM, has been a front-and centre feature of graphics card spec sheets for generations, but it's started to matter a lot more in recent years. While flagship graphics cards have exploded in their VRAM quantities, with the 5090 now offering 32GB, most mainstream cards have been getting by with less. It was only a couple of generations ago that the flagship RTX 3080 only had 10GB of VRAM, and outside of the top few models, you'll still see 12GB, 10GB, or even 8GB.

22,2025-03-07,"Samsungâs upcoming Android XR project is turning heads, not just because it has a variety of Vision Pro-like features, but because it may have even better displays than Appleâs $3,500 headset. Thatâs not necessarily a good thing. It would mean Samsungâs âProject Moohanâ could cost well over $1,000 just to stick a computer on your face. If Appleâs headset has taught us anything, it’s that few people want to spend anything more than $500 on a VR device.
As first spotted by 9to5Google, Korean tech news site The Elec reported based on anonymous industry sources that Samsungâs upcoming XR (extended reality) project has large and dense displays. As read with machine translation, The Elec claims the displays on its upcoming Android XR headset are 1.3-inch OLEDOS (OLED on Silicon) panels with a pixel density of 3,800 PPI, or pixels per inch. Compare that to the $500 Meta Quest 3âs displays at 1,200 PPI, and itâs already impressive. More importantly, itâs even more dense than the Apple Vision Proâs similar micro-OLED panels, which cap out at 3,400 PPI.
The report notes that these panels are for the Project Moohan (Moohan means âinfinityâ in Korean) thatâs still sitting behind closed doors at Samsung. As noted by The Elec, these types of displays are expensive. The panels for Samsungâs headset and the Vision Pro are produced by Sony. That company had shown off 1.3-inch, 4K OLED panels in 2023 costing more than $1,000. Even if Sony and Samsung mass manufacture these kinds of displays, Project Moohan would be shaping up to be a very expensive product.
Appleâs $3,500 âspatial computerâ is one of the most capable headsets available with the best, prettiest OLED displays. Despite that, Apple has struggled to carve a niche for its ultra-expensive headset. Vision Pro sales in 2024 were down just a few months after launch. Late last year, The Information reported, based on anonymous sources, that Apple has quit production of the device, knowing it had enough components to meet demand.
Apple has been updating its headset over time, most recently bringing Apple Intelligence features to the visionOS 2. It technically offers some of the largest displays possible for streaming games or blowing your MacBook screen up to enormous, ultrawide proportions. The problem is the price and what youâre expected to do on Vision Pro. The lack of controllers essentially makes it useless for VR gaming. While Apple has brought more passive, short-form content to the platform, itâs not enough to entice more people to drop $3,500 on a new device.
Android XR is shaping up to be very, very similar to the Apple Vision Pro. YouTuber Marques Brownlee offered us our best look inside the Samsung headset. It has full-color passthrough with external cameras for augmented reality capabilities. This lets you manipulate your apps in 3D space. The big new feature is Googleâs Gemini. The AI has access to Samsungâs external cameras, allowing users to ask it questions about the environment. For instance, Brownlee asked Gemini about a photo of the Wadi Rum desert in Jordan. The headset opened up Google Maps to show him the area through satellite imagery.
Is that the kind of feature that will have people lining up around the block to spend more than $2,000 on a headset? Probably not. The Vision Pro is capable, though itâs also bulky and uncomfortable after using it for too long. Samsungâs headset seems lighter than Appleâs, but thatâs not the big reason consumers didnât adopt the Vision Pro like Apple hoped they would. Itâs a factor of price compared to its capabilities. The Vision Pro can act like a beautiful, massive TV, but only for one user at a time. You can get an excellent OLED TV for far less and enjoy it with your family.
The elephant in the room is Meta with its $500 Meta Quest 3 and $300 Meta Quest 3s. Any other competing headset, like the HTC Vive Focus Vision, canât match its capabilities even at the $1,000 price point. Meta has had a head start ever since it bought Oculus back in 2014, and now it has a loss-leading position on the VR market. Still, even Meta does not seem immune to the idea of a more-expensive VR headset. Bloomberg recently reported that Meta is planning on a sequel to the more-expensive Meta Quest Pro. That headset sold so poorly the company dropped it from its lineup two years after launch.
Nobody is talking about the âmetaverseâ anymore, but companies like Google, Meta, and Apple all still think workers want to spend hours of their day trapped in a VR headset. VR or AR gaming is fun, but itâs not for anybody who gets motion sick or feels vertigo. Until these devices get as light and comfortable as a pair of glasses, XR wonât be the follow up to the smartphone as so many companies seem to think they are.

23,2025-03-07,"The Dow slumped more than 300 points Friday afternoon before recovering ground to trade higher. That followed a days-long selloff that had markets on track for their worst week in about two years amid a cascade of tariffs and tariff relief measures that left investors reeling with uncertainty.
Meanwhile, February’s jobs report came in weaker than expected. Nonfarm payrolls rose by a seasonally adjusted 151,000, an improvement from January’s downwardly revised 125,000 but below the projected 170,000. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.1%.
As the day ended in New York, the S&P 500 added 0.5%, while the Nasdaq 100 popped up 0.7%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.5%.
Walgreens (WBA+0.18%) stock rose 7% Friday after Walgreens Boots Alliance  agreed to a $10 billion acquisition by Sycamore Partners, marking a shift to a privately held company. Sycamore will purchase Walgreens for $11.45 per share in cash.
Walgreens’ woes are extensive. As consumers increasingly turned to e-commerce giants like Amazon for everyday essentials, Walgreens struggled to keep pace. Meanwhile, rivals like CVS merged with health insurers, gaining control of the lucrative reimbursement market. Caught on a tightrope, Walgreens failed to find its balance. In Oct. 2024, the company announced plans to close 1,200 stores in an effort to stem its financial losses.
Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, lost billions of dollars in the first two months of the year, but he’s still holding onto his title.
The Tesla (TSLA+5.27%) and SpaceX CEO — and de facto head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) — has seen his estimated net worth drop from a peak of $486 billion to $330 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires List. That $156 billion loss still leaves him far ahead of Jeff Bezos, whose projected net worth stands at $222 billion. On Friday afternoon, Tesla stock was down over 2%.

26,2025-03-07,"Samsung's Galaxy A16 5G offers peak affordability, but it also comes with a great upgrade promise.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

If you're in the market for a discounted Samsung phone, you're in luck. Amazon and other retailers have knocked 13% off the already affordable Samsung Galaxy A16 5G, even though it only became available in January.
Unlike the last-generation base-level phone, the Galaxy A15, the A16 5G includes six years of OS upgrades, although one of them is simply from Android 14 to the already-available version 15. Nonetheless, Samsung also put a larger 6.7-inch AMOLED display in this generation, sporting a 90Hz refresh rate and up to 800 nits of brightness, all of which are previously unheard of at this price point.
With this deal, you can get an extra $25 off this smartphone, despite the fact that it's new and is already under $200. For the budget-friendly buyer, this is definitely an option worth considering.
Samsung Galaxy A16 5G (128GB): $199.99 $174.99 at Amazon
Multiple retailers have cut 13% off the Samsung Galaxy A16 5G, an already-affordable phone that also came out this year. From its 6.7-inch AMOLED display to the promise of six years of OS and security updates, it's pretty tough to find anything even close to these specs around this price point. The extra $25 off doesn't hurt, either.
Price comparison: Best Buy - $174.99 | Walmart - $174.99
✅Recommended if: you don't mind going for an entry-level phone, and would appreciate an extra $25 off; you're looking for a phone with a decently sized AMOLED screen; having a smartphone with a large battery and/or a 25W charging speed is a priority for you.
❌Skip this deal if: you're looking for a phone with industry-leading performance; you want a smartphone with more than 4GB of RAM.
Samsung launched the affordable Galaxy A16 5G in January, and retailers are already offering early discounts on the smartphone. With 128GB of storage, a 5,000mAh battery, and a decent set of cameras, the A16 is a great budget-friendly Galaxy offering, especially including its improvements from the A15.
This generation offers multiple upgrades from the economy-level A15, including a 6.7-inch AMOLED display instead of 6.5 inches, and six years of OS updates compared to four—and despite the fact that one will upgrade the phone from One UI 6, based on Android 14, to the already-available Android 15.
Still, the A16 also includes an upgraded 2.4 GHz Exynos 1330 processor and an IP54 dust and water resistance rating, neither of which were included in the prior generation. It also comes with six years of security updates, and this deal is available for either the Blue Black or Light Gray color options.At under $200, the A16 5G already offered a solid bang for your buck as a decently performing phone, but those who love the Galaxy ecosystem and want an extra $25 off, this might be worth considering.

CANADA - 2025/01/28: In this photo illustration, the Stryker Corporation logo is seen displayed on a ... [+] smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)
 
Stryker (NYSE: SYK), the medical devices powerhouse, has recently launched its Sync Badge—a hands-free, wearable communication device designed to enhance collaboration among healthcare teams. This new device addresses the ongoing nursing shortage by streamlining workflows and providing seamless access to critical people and information. [1] Despite the launch of the Sync Badge, Stryker’s stock did not show any significant appreciation. This muted reaction can be partly attributed to broader market conditions. Investors have grown cautious as markets decline amid rising uncertainties, particularly in response to new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Separately, with earnings drawing near, see How ORCL Stock Might React To Upcoming Earnings?
With a market capitalization of $150 billion and shares trading near all-time highs, Stryker has undeniably delivered exceptional long-term value to its shareholders. Nevertheless, investors should consider the company’s vulnerability during economic downturns. Evidence from 2022 demonstrates this risk, when Stryker’s stock plummeted by more than 30% within just a few quarters. This historical pattern raises the question: could Stryker’s current nearly $380 share price potentially retreat below $300 if similar market conditions recur? For those seeking growth with reduced single‐stock volatility, the High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative, having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception.
Stryker’s innovative approach makes it appealing, but the prevailing economic uncertainties in the U.S. pose a considerable risk that investors must consider. What risk is that?
Although inflation concerns have lessened, they still persist. The Trump administration’s aggressive policies on tariffs and immigration have reignited worries about a potential resurgence of inflation. These factors could drive the U.S. economy into turbulence or even a recession, as detailed in our macroeconomic analysis.
Adding to these economic challenges is heightened geopolitical instability resulting from the Trump administration’s assertive international policies. The ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict continues to affect global stability, while trade relationships face growing uncertainty. Even long-standing allies such as Canada and Mexico are being called upon to renegotiate terms, further complicating the risk landscape for investors.
SYK stock has fared worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some recent downturns. Concerned about the impact of a market crash on SYK stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash illustrates how key stocks performed during and after the last six market crashes.
Stryker’s current valuation presents an additional challenge, as the stock trades at premium multiples of nearly 7x last year’s sales and approximately 31x last year’s earnings. These metrics surpass the company’s four-year historical averages of under 6x sales and below 28x earnings, despite being partly justified by recent improvements in profitability. Further complicating the investment case, Stryker faces slowing growth prospects, with consensus estimates projecting revenue growth of 9% in 2025 and 8% in 2026—both lower than the 10% increase achieved in 2024.
Given this slowdown in growth and the broader economic uncertainties, ask yourself this question: do you intend to hold on to your Stryker stock now, or will you panic and sell if it begins to drop to $300, $200, or even lower levels? Holding onto a falling stock is never easy. Trefis collaborates with Empirical Asset Management—a Boston area wealth manager—whose asset allocation strategies yielded positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P lost more than 40%. Empirical has integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio within this asset allocation framework to offer clients better returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; providing a less turbulent ride, as evidenced by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Tesla stock is down 46% from its December 2024 high, according to CNBC, a $677 billion loss in stock market value.
That still leaves the company with $842 billion in market cap – 8.6 times Tesla’s 2024 revenue of $97.7 billion, according to Tesla’s 2024 Form 10K.
Does this drop in the stock price make the company’s shares a buy? After suffering its first decline in automotive sales in 2024, a 7.6% decline, the stock will surely rise if Tesla shipments grow faster than investors expect.
However, the stock’s headwinds are numerous – including the company’s relatively old models, vehicle quality problems, plunging resale values, and rivals offering improved technology, better battery range, and lower prices, according to the Wall Street Journal.
To be sure, Tesla has promised new models and robots, as I wrote in a January 2025 Forbes post. Since then, CEO Elon Musk’s role in the Trump administration has added more to the company’s woes.
How so? Once-proud Tesla owners are struggling to ditch their vehicles to escape the social opprobrium associated with Musk’s role in the Department of Government Efficiency, according to the New York Times.
Tesla did not respond to requests for comment from the Journal and the Times. I have contacted Tesla and will update this post if I receive a response.
While Tesla once enjoyed explosive growth, recently “monthly U.S. sales have seesawed between 50,000 and 60,000,” reported the Times.
The value of used Tesla’s has deteriorated considerably. Tesla accounted for four of the 20 used-car models with the largest drop in value for the year ending in January 2025, iSeeCars.com executive analyst Karl Brauer told the Times. At the top of the list was the Tesla Model 3 (with a 27.1% drop in value) and Model Y (down 21.9%), noted the Times.
Tesla’s popularity has plunged since 2022. That was before Musk’s foray into presidential politics, when 22% of car shoppers said they would “definitely consider” a Tesla for their next vehicle purchase, according to a Strategic Vision report featured by the Journal.
By the summer of 2024, that figure had dropped to 7%. “At this point, we don’t see any signs of recovery,” the firm’s president Alexander Edwards told the Journal. Tesla’s “historic appeal to environmentally minded buyers” is at odds with Musk’s politics, he added.
Some Tesla owners are moving quickly to replace their vehicles to avoid the shame of being associated with Musk’s “values and politics,” noted the Times. Here are four examples:
Tesla’s drop in worldwide deliveries last year was at odds with explosive growth in the rest of the industry – which enjoyed a 25% sales increase, the Journal noted. In the U.S., Tesla sales fell 7% in 2024, and by 2% in the first two months of 2025, Wards Intelligence estimates.
Decline in Tesla demand abounds in Germany, France, and China. New-vehicle registrations for Tesla were down 76.3% in Germany, 26% in France, and 49% in China last month, according to government and industry association data featured by the Journal.
It takes years to build a reputation and far less time to destroy it. With help from Tesla employees and the EV community, Tesla became a popular EV brand. “A deep social media addiction, purchasing of Twitter, a move into politics, a few salutes, and now most of that incredible work is gone,” concluded EV news site Electrek."

37,2025-03-07,"A Friday rally was not enough to reverse a brutal start to March for U.S. stocks, as investors digested a barrage of economic data and policies from President Donald Trump, particularly the uncertainty of his extensive tariffs on the country’s top three trade partners.
It's a red March thus far in the stock market.
The most widely followed American stock index, the S&P 500 (down 3.1% since last Friday) registered its worst weekly losses since the week ending Sept. 6, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (down 2.4%) suffered its worst loss since February.
That came even as the Dow rose 0.5%, or 220 points, and the S&P gained 0.6% in Friday trading as February’s jobs report came in just shy of economist forecasts.The S&P closed at its lowest end-of-week level since the week ending Nov. 1, ahead of the election.
The S&P closed at its lowest end-of-week level since the week ending Nov. 1, ahead of the election.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and the Russell 2000, which tracks smaller companies with a median market capitalization of about $1 billion, suffered even bigger percentage losses this week, as the Nasdaq fell 3.5% to its lowest end-of-week price since early October and the Russell sank 3.9% to its lowest level since June.
Driving the losses were flipflops from Trump on tariffs, as his 25% levies on Canadian and Mexican goods and 10% additional duty on Chinese imports went into effect Tuesday, before delaying most of the Canadian and Mexican tariffs until April on Thursday, and then teasing new tariffs on some Canadian goods Friday.
“I’m not even looking at the market,” Trump said Thursday, before adding there will be “a little short-term interruption.”
More than $3 trillion. That’s how much market value has been wiped out from the S&P from its Feb. 19 all-time high, according to FactSet data, as the index fell 6%.
In terms of market value lost, Elon Musk’s car company Tesla and artificial intelligence chip designer Nvidia are the two biggest losers dating back to Feb. 19, as Nvidia lost $712 billion in market cap and Tesla $322 billion in that timeframe. In addition to Nvidia and Tesla, a slew of big-name companies suffered 8% or greater stock selloffs this week, including American Express, Bank of America, Boeing, Citigroup, Costco, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Netflix and Wells Fargo.
Beyond the likely negative impact on corporate earnings, at least in the short term, of tariffs, the constantly shifting tariff implementation dates and exceptions have led to heightened uncertainty, something investors largely despise.  “It seems as if there have been very few times in markets where one has to interpret so much disparate, and at times conflicting, data relative to the economy and influences on it,” Rick Rieder, the head of BlackRock’s global allocation investment team, wrote to clients Friday. Stocks initially soared after Trump’s November win, as the Dow tacked on about 3,000 points in the three weeks after the election, gains spurred by prevailing hopes of corporate tax cuts and more lax regulations, before sentiment soured as Trump enacted his economic agenda. Trump’s “policies appear to be tilting towards a less business-friendly stance,” remarked JPMorgan Chase economists Bruce Kasman and Joseph Lupton in a Friday note. The S&P is down about 4% dating back to Trump’s January inauguration.

Elon Musk's net worth has tumbled by $102 billion this year following a sharp decline in Tesla stock. That figure is about the same as the United Parcel Service's entire market value.

        The Tesla and SpaceX CEO's wealth has shrunk by about 24% in under 10 weeks to $330 billion at Thursday's close, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
    

        Musk is still comfortably the world's richest person, with a roughly $108 billion lead over second-place Jeff Bezos, despite being the biggest wealth loser this year. He's well ahead of Michael Dell, whose net worth is down $20 billion.
    

        Musk's fortune has been hit by a 35% plunge in Tesla's share price this year, from about $404 to $263. The sell-off has cut its market value by more than $400 billion to under $900 billion.
    

        Investors have dumped the automaker's stock for several reasons. Musk spent more than $250 million to help Donald Trump get reelected, stumped at the Republican candidate's rallies, and marshaled his X followers to vote for Trump in November's election.
    

        The tech billionaire has remained a close advisor since Trump's victory, spearheading efforts to streamline federal spending with his White House DOGE office.
    

        The combination of his divisive politics, concerns about his new role distracting from his CEO duties, and reports of Tesla sales declines in several countries have weighed on the company's shares.
    

        Several other members of the $100 billion club have taken a hit to their fortunes from the recent slump in stocks, which has been fueled by worries that Trump's tariffs and government cuts will cool economic growth or even cause a recession.
    

        Oracle's Larry Ellison has had $19 billion wiped off his wealth, reducing it to $173 billion. Similarly, Nvidia's Jensen Huang and Amazon's Bezos have each had about $17 billion erased from their respective net worths this year.
    

        Bezos is now tied with Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg on $222 billion; Zuckerberg has added $14 billion to his wealth in 2025, while the Amazon founder has shed almost $17 billion.

The stock market just capped off its worst weekly decline in six months as investors dealt with the political realities of President Donald Trump's administration.

        Uncertainties related to tariffs, the federal government's DOGE-induced layoffs, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's forecast of a ""detox period"" for the US economy drove investors into risk-off mode.
    

        The Nasdaq 100 briefly dipped into correction territory on Friday, falling 10% from its mid-February high, and is down more than 3% this week, along with the Samp;P 500.


        These four charts help explain this week's action in markets.
    

        The S&P 500 experienced its worst weekly decline since early September, when the index dropped 4.3% following a weaker-than-expected August jobs report.


        Of note, the index tested its 200-day moving average this week for the first time since November 2023. It's a key technical threshold that could signal more pain to come if it trades decisively lower. 
    

        Semiconductor stocks cratered this week, with Nvidia dropping 10%, extending its decline to its lowest level since September. Shares of the top chipmaker have seen $1 trillion in market capitalization wiped out since peaking in early January.
    

        The sell-off was exacerbated by earnings results and a weaker-than-expected outlook from Marvell Technology, which is exposed to the fast-growing AI sector.
    

        A bright spot on Friday was Broadcom stock, which rose 8% amid strong guidance that kept investors' hopes for the AI trade alive. 
    

        The tariff uncertainty contributed to the downside volatility in the US dollar this week.
    

        The US dollar index, which measures the dollar against a basket of other major currencies, declined more than 3%, its biggest weekly drop since November 2022.
    

        That's been the opposite of what markets expected, as inflationary pressure of tariffs was predicted to keep rates high and boost the currency. Instead, headwinds to growth and questions around the ""US exceptionalism"" trade have caused the dollar to dip versus rivals. 
    

        Trump pushed ahead with tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada only to exempt items covered by the USMCA trade agreement at the last minute.
    

        On Friday, Trump said reciprocal tariffs could be enacted as soon as this week, or early next week.
    

        The 10-year US Treasury yield surged 20 basis points since Tuesday, and is up 11 basis points for the week.
    

        A strong rebound in US Services PMI, a decline in initial jobless claims, and a lukewarm February jobs report contributed to the upside move.

40,2025-03-07,"The tale of the Microsoft Xbox Kinect is one of those sad situations where a great product was used in an application that turned out to be a bit of a flop and was discontinued because of it, despite its usefulness in other areas. This article from the Guardian is a quick read on how this handy depth camera has found other uses in somewhat niche areas, with not a computer game in sight.
It’s rather obvious that a camera that can generate a 3D depth map, in parallel with a 2D reference image, could have many applications beyond gaming, especially in the hands of us hackers. Potential uses include autonomous roving robots, 3D scanning, and complex user interfaces—there are endless possibilities. Artists producing interactive art exhibits would sit firmly in that last category, with the Kinect used in countless installations worldwide.
Apparently, the Kinect also has quite the following in ghost-hunting circles, which as many a dubious TV show would demonstrate, seem almost entirely filmed under IR light conditions. The Kinect’s IR-based structured light system is well-suited for these environments. Since its processing core runs a machine learning application specifically trained to track human figures, it’s no surprise that the device can pick up those invisible, pesky spirits hiding in the noise. Anyway, all of these applications depend on the used-market supply of Kinect devices, over a decade old, that can be found online and in car boot sales, which means one day, the Kinect really will die off, only to be replaced with specialist devices that cost orders of magnitude more to acquire.
In the unlikely event you’ve not encountered non-gaming applications for the Kinect, here’s an old project to scan an entire room to get you started. Just to be perverse, here’s a gaming application that Microsoft didn’t think of, and to round out, the bad news that Microsoft has really has abandoned the product.
Talking about the Kinect and Not a mention of the VR sandbox?
Agreed, that is a great project.
https://ar-sandbox.eu/augmented-reality-sandbox-software/
Please do not forget its predecessor by Oliver Kreylos at UCDavis.
I made an instance of Oliver Kreylos’ great sARndbox for a Maker Faire:
https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~okreylos/ResDev/SARndbox/LinkDownload.html
THAT makes more sense because I see it’s a Linux installation and that’s what I recall since I’ve not run Windows since the late ’90s.
When I was working at Mozilla, in one of my many unofficial side projects I added Kinect support to Firefox, which made the RGB camera and depth map available to normal web content via a JavaScript API. TypeArrays were just being added as an experimental feature – they were still very limited and still had a lot of performance bottlenecks, but it worked well enough. It made it really easy to play around with the data and experiment with drawing it to a Canvas element that was part of other web content. Fun times.
Is the app available?
For anyone that is interested:  The older version of the Kinect is the version to snag – it is much easier to interface with via open source libraries on all the common development environments.  Because of this, there is much higher demand for the older version and ebay prices reflect that.
It’s been a while since I bought and tinkered with a used Kinect, so there might have been some developments cracking the newer version since I was last looking into them.
Indeed. A peripheral killed too soon and not often enough thought of for what it’s best for. Very strange, a fairly unique case. There are Chinese knock-offs these days which interface with the same libraries which are still produced, but they aren’t as good and the documentation is very spotty. I think Lumoplay uses one.
I got lucky then and snagged a bag full of them from shopgoodwill a decade ago
I just had another look.  They are still selling “untested” lots for cheap. Coming to about less than $5/ea without psus
Yeah the new hardware is MUCH better but unfortunately the drivers that Microsoft provide don’t make any use of it anyway. So there is no point in getting the newer one, and the old one is easier to get going.
I just looked into it for VRChat support (full limb tracking etc)
My first MakerFaire project way back in 2012 was a OpenCV app that detected the position of your hands and applied it as differential steering values to drive a Roomba around. It was a hit when it worked, but the Sun washed out the IR light which meant a lot of the day it really struggled.
Said project: https://blog.aaroneiche.com/2012/09/20/me-at-the-portland-makerfaire/
One thing to note, especially for battery powered projects like an autonomous robot, the kinect is quite power hungry.
It’s a bit of a faff but there are ways to bring the power cost way down, the 12v bits are needed for the motors if memory serves but the rest can run from USB.
https://medium.com/robotics-weekends/how-to-turn-old-kinect-into-a-compact-usb-powered-rgbd-sensor-f23d58e10eb0
It was an interesting technology and great gadget to hack. It was not a ‘great product’. A great product has or creates a demand for its existence and is affordably produced to create profit and long term preferably repeat customers. Kinect was not that.
Yeah, I concur with that. It’s easy to just call everything a ‘product’ when really it’s a product of engineering that I think of. A thing. A gadget. A commercial failure. I still own three.
Microsoft didn’t invent the Kinect technology, they licensed it from Primesense. After Primesense worked with Google and demo’d an Android tablet with an embedded PrimeSense 3D camera, Apple purchased Primesense and mothballed it for 10+ years.
When the Kinect first hit the market, Microsoft didn’t provide any 3rd party use libraries so Adafruit put out a reward for the first working library. It took about a week and then another week before Microsoft threatened to sue Adafruit. Limur didn’t back down and Microsoft backed off. The Kinect became a hit in the Linux robotics field. Asus and others also licensed the tech from Primesense and Primesense published lots of libraries for use. It all disappeared once Apple closed the deal.
Some internet archives were around with the Primesense code last I looked over 15 years ago.
I have seen Xbox Kinect being used at an airport for bag drop off (Changi Airport)
I know that somewhat after Kinect was launched, some manufacturers began to offer CMOS sensors with  RGBI (Red, Green, Blue, Infrared) filters instead of Bayer ones, pointing to this kind of applications, but I can’t find them anywhere. Does anybody know if there is today a reasonably-priced USB cam with that kind of sensor/filter? (I have some ideas that I want to try, and I need that).
DFRobot do a camera sensor that can manage to track 4 IR sources at one time, it’s incredibly popular with modern DIY lightgun projects.
But that isn’t what I need… I want a camera that can give me, at the same time, an infrared and a color picture.
Funny story, Singapore Airport automated bag drop machines use Kinects. Personally confirmed 2 months ago when I was there:
https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/1hqbe5f/bag_drops_at_singapore_airport_use_xbox_kinect/
I love the kinect.
I built an AR Sandbox with Oliver Kreylos’s instructions and software.
I’m also using it as a person tracker to drive a big person-follower halloween-eye :)
The project has not been completely abandoned.  It morphed into Azure Kinect and the same technology has been repackaged as the Orbbec Femto Bolt.
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kinect-dk
https://store.orbbec.com/products/femto-bolt
The XBOX Kinect is an incredible piece of hardware for what it costs. Once all the used ones finally break there is going to be a real void left. What other device can give you high resolution time of flight depth images at 30Hz for a few hundred bucks? I don’t think there are any.
I saw them being used at Disney world. The Peter Pan line had interactive holographic butterflies I looked up and to my surprise saw the Kinect on the ceiling pointing down.
I used the Kinect for a few dance performances. I controlled or puppeteered a character in a game engine while I danced. I have also seen them used at Arttechhouse for interactive projections
There is one inside of a Tempo: https://tempo.fit/studio-suite
I remember when I was just discovering vrchat and wanted to use my xb1 kinect for tracking
Then I learned that I needed a $300 adapter that I could only get secondhand from China to actually connect it to my pc and decided against it
It’s been closer to a decade now, wonder if theres a cheaper way to do that, it’s just been sitting connected to my xbox under my TV collecting dust…
I think there is actually, I don’t know where I found it, but you can connect a normal usb 3 cable and solder some wires internally to connect a power supply and then it works, at least it did for me.
As someone in the paranormal community, I have used Kinect for ghost hunting.
I think it was over 10 years ago, I was trying to test 3d scanning using a kinect as well as using a laser light projected as a horizontal beam.
This was for a client who was fabricating parts with their CNC for cars and motorcycles.
I remember using David Scanner and I think there was some other software to do this. While it worked, the results were not what the client wanted as the resolution was too low.
I think I spent a few hours tinkering with this setup. It’s great how far 3d scanning technology has come, but it’s still nowhere near the cost of a $20 laser light or your Kinect and some free software.
Then again, you can now use your cellphone as a 3d scanner and get better results.

41,2025-03-07,"Tesla (TSLA) stock was booming as 2024 came to a close, hitting a new all-time high and closing at more than $420 per share. Now sales are getting slammed in Europe and those gains have been all but erased, with most fingers pointing at CEO Elon Musk’s close ties with the Trump administration. 
But according to one of Tesla’s biggest supporters on Wall Street, that’s all noise distracting from the company’s long-term potential. 
“This is a gut check moment for the Tesla bulls (including ourselves) after this massive sell-off in Tesla shares with fears mounting,” Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities and a major Tesla bull, wrote in a Friday note. “The bears own the Tesla narrative in the near-term.”
Sales in Sweden and Norway dropped 42% and 48% last month, while in Germany — where Tesla builds some of its best-selling electric vehicles — deliveries dropped 76%. That follows an across-the-board decline the previous month.
 In Australia, sales dropped almost 72%. In California, traditionally Tesla’s biggest domestic market, new vehicle registrations fell 11.6% last year, according to the California New Car Dealers Association.
Musk has spent much of his time since the election working alongside President Donald Trump in Washington, serving as the de facto leader of the Department of Government Efficiency, which has been embroiled in legal battles. He’s also taken time out of his busy schedule to endorse Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany party and participate in an online campaign to convince British officials to release far-right agitator Tommy Robinson.
Musk’s political activities have cost Tesla about $15 billion in brand value, Brand Finance told CNBC in January.
“While the DOGE/Trump Musk iron clad partnership has created major brand worries for Tesla... we estimate less than 5% of Tesla sales globally are at risk from these issues despite the global draconian narrative for Musk,” Ives wrote. 
Tesla stock was mostly flat in Friday morning trading. But it’s down about 30% so far this year.
Wedbush expects that as DOGE ramps up its work across the federal government, which has produced a massive surge in layoffs, Musk will split his time more evenly between DOGE and his largest companies, Tesla and SpaceX. Adding to his responsibilities are his work at the other companies in his portfolio, such as X, xAI and Neuralink. 
Ives said he views the Trump administration as the “best thing that ever happened to Musk and Tesla,” citing a push to develop a federal approach to regulating autonomous vehicles. The Austin, Texas-based automaker plans to launch a ride-hailing service in at least two states this year using vehicles equipped with its advanced driver assistance package. Tesla’s designated robotaxi, the Cybercab, is scheduled to enter volume production next year. 
Wedbush is also excitedly eying Tesla’s Optimus humanoid robots, which the company has been working on for several years. 
Musk has frequently described the robots as, eventually, being capable of doing anything from factory work to serving as a bodyguard or teacher. Tesla hopes to build 10,000 Optimus robots this year and enter volume production in 2026, with plans to eventually sell them for between $20,000 and $25,000.
“We believe autonomous and Optimus will represent 90% of the valuation of the Tesla story and create a company with a valuation that exceeds $2 trillion,” Ives said. After recent sell-offs, Tesla’s market capitalization is $830 billion.

Acer Android

Acer is returning to the smartphone world, and today we learned the first two devices that will launch on March 25. They are called Acerpure Acerone Liquid S162E4 and Acerpure Acerone Liquid S272E4, and yes, these are the real names.
Both devices have entry-level specs, including a six-year-old chipset by Mediatek.



Acerpure Acerone Liquid S162E4 • Acerpure Acerone Liquid S272E4
This device will have a 6.5"" LCD with HD+ resolution and a waterdrop notch for the selfie camera. The chipset is Helio P35, which is coupled with 4 GB RAM and 64 GB storage. The camera on the back has a 16 MP sensor, while the front-facing shooter will take 5 MP stills.
The phone packs a 5,000 mAh battery and a USB-C port. We know the OS will be Android 14, and the phone will also have FM Radio, Bluetooth, and a hybrid dual nano SIM slot.
The S162E4 will come in only one color – Blue. The power key is below the volume rocker on the right side, and it seems like it will double as a fingerprint scanner because of its flat surface. We have yet to learn the price but are confident it will be under $100, which is no more than INR 9,000.
Here, the LCD is 6.74” in diagonal, keeping the HD+ resolution and the waterdrop notch with a 5 MP camera behind. Speaking of cameras, the dual combo on the back includes a 20 MP main shooter.
Interestingly enough, the chipset of the S272E4 has an even less powerful CPU. Its model number is MT6765X, which is actually the Helio G36, announced ""only"" two years ago. RAM is once again 4 GB, while storage is 64 GB. S272E4 also comes with a 5,000 mAh battery and Android 14.
We are not quite sure if these phones are Acer products. They are more likely licensed products by an ODM, aiming to capitalize on the popularity of the Taiwanese brand. We will know more on March 25, once the devices launch on Amazon.

43,2025-03-07,"Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, lost billions of dollars in the first two months of the year, but he’s still holding onto his title.
The Tesla (TSLA+5.27%) and SpaceX CEO — and de facto head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) — has seen his estimated net worth drop from a peak of $486 billion to $330 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires List. That $156 billion loss still leaves him far ahead of Jeff Bezos, whose projected net worth stands at $222 billion.
Musk’s shrinking fortune is largely tied to Tesla’s stock, which has plunged about 36% since the start of the year as the company struggles with slowing sales. Roughly 60% of Musk’s wealth comes from Tesla shares and options. The rest of his wealth comes from his other ventures. His net worth skyrocketed when SpaceX hit a $350 billion valuation, making it the world’s most valuable startup. Meanwhile, xAI, his artificial intelligence startup, raised $6 billion in funding, pushing its valuation to $50 billion.
Tesla stock soared at the end of 2024, briefly surpassing $420 per share, but those gains have vanished as sales took a hit — especially in Europe. 
Sales in Sweden and Norway dropped 42% and 48% last month, while in Germany — where Tesla builds some of its best-selling electric vehicles — deliveries dropped 76%. That follows an across-the-board decline the previous month.
In Australia, sales dropped almost 72%. In California, traditionally Tesla’s biggest domestic market, new vehicle registrations fell 11.6% last year, according to the California New Car Dealers Association.

NEW YORK, NEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 13: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during ... [+] afternoon trading on September 13, 2022 in New York City. U.S. stocks opened lower today and closed significantly low with the Dow Jones dropping over 1,200 points after the release of an inflation report that showed prices rising more than expected in the last month. The Consumer Price Index released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed prices rising 8.3% over the last year, for which economists had predicted an 8.1% increase. (Photo by Michael M.

Stocks fell hard in the first week of March as investors digested another busy week of earnings, economic, and political news. The Nasdaq is flirting with correction territory which is a 10% decline from a recent high. Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 is flirting with bear market territory and is down almost 20% from its recent high. This isn’t a gentle pullback—it’s a hard fall, driven by tariff fears, economic jitters, and a tech sector that’s losing its shine. Yet, amid the wreckage, there’s a case to be made: the market’s oversold and due for a bounce. If it can’t bounce, look out below—things could get uglier fast.
On Monday, stocks opened higher but closed lower after President Donald Trump doubled down on his tariff agenda, confirming 25% duties on Canada and Mexico starting April 1, alongside a 10% tariff on China. 
  Stocks fell again Tuesday as tariff uncertainty sent stocks lower. After the close, the Commerce Secretary floated the idea that an extension may occur for some areas and futures rallied. On Tuesday evening, Trump addressed a joint session of Congress and made a bullish case for all his accomplishments since he took office.
On Wednesday we had a short-lived midweek rally, sparked by rumors of tariff exemptions for auto manufacturers. However, sellers showed up on Thursday and sent stocks much lower. 
  Before Friday’s open, the government said U.S. employers added a seasonally adjusted 151,000 last month. That was better than the downwardly revised 125,000 in January but lower than the 170,000 consensus forecast. A few hours later, Chair Jay Powell said the Federal Reserve will focus on its dual mandate and not focus on the “noise.” The opened lower on Friday but turned higher as the bulls try to defend the longer-term 200 DMA line and help the market bounce from deeply oversold levels.
Trump’s tariffs kicked in this week and those spooked markets. Canada and Mexico supply critical inputs—think auto parts and steel—and a 25% tax could hurt production and increase costs. China’s tariffs hit many other areas and all this could hurt corporate profits going forward. Goldman Sachs warned of a “tariff shock” shaving 1% off GDP growth if unresolved, and JPMorgan flagged a “profit recession” risk for multinationals.
Here’s the flip side: the market’s screaming oversold. The CNN Fear And Greed Index, is at extreme pessimism which usually happens after a big move down and signals a bounce could be near. Other technical indicators are also oversold, suggesting the market can easily bounce from here.
What if we don’t bounce? We can easily have another leg down. 
  The S&P 500 is trading near its 200-day moving average and if it can’t hold, we can easily have another leg down. The small-cap Russell 2000 is almost in bear market territory and it will not take much for it to fall into a bear market.
On the economic front, the big focus next week will be inflation and retail sales. 
  Next week, we have retail sales, the Consumer Price Index, and the Producer Price Index. On Friday we have the industrial production and the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index.
Trump will meet with Canada’s Justin Trudeau midweek and that could move the needle, plus any other news on the tariff front.
Defense is key until the bulls regain control of the market. 
  I would be remiss not to note that many international stock markets are outperforming U.S. stocks in 2025. Additionally, gold remains strong and is on the verge of breaking out to new record highs."

From Fed Chair Powell: Economic Outlook Despite elevated levels of uncertainty, the U.S. economy continues to be in a good place. The labor market is solid, and inflation has moved closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal. At the Federal Reserve, we are intently focused on the dual-mandate goals given to us by Congress: maximum employment and stable prices.

Recent Economic Data
Economic growth
The economy has been growing at a solid pace. GDP expanded at a 2.3 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of last year, extending a period of consistent growth that has been supported by resilient consumer spending. Recent indicators point to a possible moderation in consumer spending relative to the rapid growth rate over the second half of 2024. Further, recent surveys of households and businesses point to heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook. It remains to be seen how these developments might affect future spending and investment. Sentiment readings have not been a good predictor of consumption growth in recent years. We continue to carefully monitor a variety of indicators of household and business spending.

The labor market
Many indicators show that the labor market is solid and broadly in balance. The jobs report released this morning showed employers added 151,000 jobs to payrolls in February and the unemployment rate was 4.1 percent last month. Smoothing over the month-to-month volatility, since September, employers have added a solid 191,000 jobs a month on average. The unemployment rate remains low and has held in a narrow range between 3.9 and 4.2 percent for the past year. The jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, and the quits rate has moved below pre-pandemic levels. Wages are growing faster than inflation, and at a more sustainable pace than earlier in the pandemic recovery. With wage growth moderating and labor supply and demand having moved into better balance, the labor market is not a significant source of inflationary pressure.

Inflation
Inflation has come down a long way from its mid-2022 peak above 7 percent without a sharp increase in unemployment—a historically unusual and most welcome outcome. While progress in reducing inflation has been broad based, recent readings remain somewhat above our 2 percent objective. The path to sustainably returning inflation to our target has been bumpy, and we expect that to continue. We see ongoing progress in categories that remain elevated, such as housing services and the market-based components of non-housing services. Inflation can be volatile month-to-month, and we do not overreact to one or two readings that are higher or lower than anticipated. Data released last week showed that total PCE prices rose 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in January and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.6 percent. We pay close attention to a broad range of measures of inflation expectations, and some near-term measures have recently moved up. We see this in both market- and survey-based measures, and survey respondents, both consumers and businesses, are mentioning tariffs as a driving factor. Beyond the next year or so, however, most measures of longer-term expectations remain stable and consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal.

Monetary Policy
Looking ahead, the new Administration is in the process of implementing significant policy changes in four distinct areas: trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and regulation. It is the net effect of these policy changes that will matter for the economy and for the path of monetary policy. While there have been recent developments in some of these areas, especially trade policy, uncertainty around the changes and their likely effects remains high. As we parse the incoming information, we are focused on separating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves. We do not need to be in a hurry, and are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.

Policy is not on a preset course. If the economy remains strong but inflation does not continue to move sustainably toward 2 percent, we can maintain policy restraint for longer. If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we can ease policy accordingly. Our current policy stance is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.

Conclusion
Before I conclude, I will note that at our last FOMC meeting, we began our second five-year review of our monetary policy framework. We will consider changes to our consensus statement (Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy) and to our communications as part of this review. The consensus statement articulates our framework for the conduct of monetary policy in pursuit of the goals assigned to us by Congress. We will consider lessons of the past five years and adapt our approach, where appropriate, to best serve the American people, to whom we are accountable. The 2 percent longer-run inflation goal will be retained and is not a focus of the review.

This public review will be familiar to those who followed our process five years ago. We will hold outreach events around the country involving a wide range of parties, including Fed Listens events. We are open to new ideas and critical feedback. We will host a research conference in Washington in May. Our intent is to wrap up the review by late summer.

Today, in the Real Estate Newsletter: Asking Rents Mostly Unchanged Year-over-year
Brief excerpt: Another monthly update on rents.

Tracking rents is important for understanding the dynamics of the housing market.  Slower household formation and increased supply (more multi-family completions) has kept asking rents under pressure. ...

Apartment List: Asking Rent Growth -0.4% Year-over-year ...On the supply side of the rental market, our national vacancy index now sits at 6.9 percent, the highest reading in the history of that monthly data series, which goes back to the start of 2017. After a historic tightening in 2021, multifamily occupancy has been slowly but consistently easing for over three years amid an influx of new inventory. 2024 saw the most new apartment completions since the mid-1980s, and with nearly 800 thousand units still in the construction pipeline, the supply boom has runway to continue into 2025.Realtor.com: 18th Consecutive Month with Year-over-year Decline in RentsIn the first month of 2025, the median asking rent across the 50 largest U.S. metropolitan areas picked up slightly to $1,703, from $1,695 in December 2024, but it remains down 0.2% from one year ago. This marks the 18th consecutive month in which rents have fallen year over year.This is much more in the article.

    In a demo at MWC 2025, the TCL glasses proved themselves far from perfect, but they're within striking distance of an ideal AR product.
  
The RayNeo X3 Pro AR glasses are a tad big for my very average head.
The bread and butter of Mobile World Congress in Barcelona is the slew of new phones that companies unveil at the show every year. But MWC is also a popular place for companies creating wearable tech to show off their latest innovations. This includes companies like TCL, which is best known for its TVs (and is increasingly becoming known for its Nxtpaper phones and tablets), but that also makes smart glasses.
When it comes to smart glasses, competition is really heating up, and TCL's RayNeo X3 Pro AR glasses, first announced at CES, provide a compelling alternative to more-basic smart glasses, such as the Meta Ray-Bans. Meta's smart glasses don't have displays in the lenses, but the X3 Pro glasses do -- thanks to projections onto the glass using wave guides.

Based on the smallest micro-LED light engine, the 2,500-nit, full-color display is visible while you're wearing the glasses, even in bright sunlight. I tried on the X3 Pros at MWC, but unfortunately it was inside a dark convention center hall, so I couldn't test out the screens in different conditions. But I could see them clearly, and they seemed to sit just at the right height to provide me with an easy viewing experience without obscuring anything.
In a demo at MWC, I saw how the glasses used a front-facing camera to examine the signs around me and automatically translate the words and phrases into French using AI (other languages are also available). This was effective, but I couldn't judge how well the AI live conversation translation works, because the hall was too noisy to pick up individual voices. I also couldn't try the built-in AI agent, as it's currently working only in Chinese. It should be ready to go in English by the time the X3 Pro hits the international market in mid-May (for around $2,000).
Read more: All the Strange, Bizarre and Wonderful Gadgets and Concepts at MWC
The X3 Pro is less weighty and bulky than its predecessors. At just 3 ounces, the glasses were light enough to wear without feeling uncomfortable, but they still looked comically large on my fairly average head -- a problem with most smart glasses. As for the gesture controls on the arms of the glasses, they were easy to pick up and seemed to work pretty much flawlessly, which is a rare feat.
Many companies are aiming to strike the right balance between aesthetics, wearability and functionality, and TCL has come pretty darn close. The X3 Pros are ultimately a well-executed vision of what AR glasses should be, where you can see both a screen and the world beyond and around it. One thing we're curious about but couldn't test on the show floor is battery life, which could be a deal-breaker as to whether we'd recommend this product."
49,2025-03-07,"
    Similar to how the government has a reserve of other currencies such as gold, this reserve houses the country's digital currency.
  
On Thursday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order authorizing the creation of a strategic bitcoin reserve. The reserve will hold bitcoin obtained by the US government through criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. 
According to billionaire David Sacks, the White House ""crypto czar,"" the estimated 200,000 bitcoin the US government currently has will be moved to the reserve.
In a message on social media platform X, Sacks likened the digital store to the gold reserves of Fort Knox. He also said that the 195,000 of bitcoin sold by the government previously amounted to ""over $17 billion in lost value."" 
It's worth noting that, as a self-proclaimed prolific crypto investor, Sacks -- along with his friends and family -- stands to potentially benefit more than most from this executive order. Sacks confirmed he's liquidated his crypto holdings prior to joining the Trump administration, but there are some concerns about other potential conflicts of interest.
A community note on his post pointed out he could have significant indirect holdings through Bitwise Asset Management. Sacks refuted the claim, stating he exited his position with the exchange-traded fund on Jan. 22.
Bitcoin isn't the only digital currency the government plans to stockpile. The executive order also established a separate US digital currency stockpile, which includes solana, ethereum, XRP and cardano. Additionally, the order calls for a full audit of the government's held digital assets.
If you hold digital currency, or are considering investing, we'll explain how this could potentially affect its value going forward.
It's part of the president's efforts to make the US the ""crypto capital of the world."" On the campaign trail, Trump promised to create a bitcoin reserve to store value. A reserve is held until it is needed, such as during economic turmoil or to pay off certain debts. The bitcoin in the reserve is owned by the Department of Treasury, which will add to it with any seized digital assets.
""The government will not acquire additional assets for the Stockpile beyond those obtained through forfeiture proceedings,"" Sacks wrote. However, the Commerce and Treasury departments are ""authorized to develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin, provided that those strategies have no incremental costs on American taxpayers.""
The US's gold reserves, for example, help to stabilize the dollar and support the world economy, while offering a guarantee against debts, hedging against inflation and providing a store of value.
However, gold has a much more stable value than bitcoin, which experiences considerable swings in price. Bitcoin crossed the $100,000 mark in early December, but remains volatile. It reached $90,451 yesterday but has since dropped to $86,970.
In addition to the bitcoin reserve, the executive order also creates a US Digital Currency Stockpile. This is a separate reserve used for holding assets other than bitcoin. Like the bitcoin reserve, the stockpile will grow as digital assets other than bitcoin are seized by the government.
Although the announcements showcase the government's interest in cryptocurrency, this measure won't make investing in cryptocurrency any less risky, for now. 
Crypto is inherently risky and often experiences price swings, but there's no denying it has increased in value over the years. In December 2022, bitcoin was valued at around $17,000. Now, it's at nearly $90,000. The crypto market will likely experience more swings in the coming months, depending on how the current administration backs crypto or pushes for legislation. 
There's no guarantee when it comes to investing in crypto. In the end, it comes down to your own investment strategy, how diversified you'd like your portfolio to be and how comfortable you are with volatility."

51,2025-03-07,"The U.S. added 151,000 jobs in February, government payrolls data showed Friday, fewer than the 160,000 economists had projected but a rise from the downwardly revised 125,000 in January. The unemployment rate unexpectedly rose from 4.0% to 4.1%. Month-on-month wage growth of 0.3% met consensus expectations.
While the February jobs report wasn’t a worst-case scenario — some observers talked about a number under 100,000 — it was still the smallest gain for any February since 2019. And the report shows that “hiring has slowed a lot and continues to decelerate,” Jefferies (JEF+1.63%)  Chief U.S. Economist Thomas Simons said.
“The bottom line is that we don’t see signs flashing red of an imminent recession, but the economy and labor market is definitely slowing,” Simons wrote in a note to clients.  Slowing employment growth will eventually shift Federal Reserve officials toward an interest-rate easing bias, he said.Economists have been divided on whether the labor market is slowing across the board or whether recent numbers showing reduced hiring and a bigger-than-expected rise in the number of continuing unemployment claims instead reflect seasonal and one-time factors. The number of new weekly claims for jobless benefits fell more than expected.
Employers more generally may be delaying filling job openings and slowing or postponing capital spending plans due to uncertainty over issues including President Donald Trump’s tariffs, Mai Capital Management’s Chief Market Srategist Christopher Grisanti told Quartz before the numbers.
“The danger is that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy with fear of a slowdown leading to an actual slowdown,” he wrote in an email.
Some data point toward a greater labor market slowdown: U.S.-based employers said they would lay off more than 172,000 people last month, a 245% increase from January and a doubling year-on-year, according to a Challenger, Gray & Christmas report.
The outplacement firm noted that employers have announced 221,812 job cuts, the highest year-to-date total since 2009, when 428,099 cuts were planned. Anecdotally, Microsoft (MSFT+1.32%) has axed almost 2,000 workers so far this year, but claims the cuts are performance-based, Business Insider reported.

LAGOS, Nigeria—A century old riverside community of more than 9,000 people located in Nigeria's largest city, Lagos, was demolished on Friday and residents were forcefully evicted.
Dozens of Lagos state officials, as well as police and young men known locally as ""area boys"" armed with machetes and clubs entered the community of Ilaje-Otumara in the early hours of Friday, forcing thousands to flee with their belongings, as bulldozers rolled through homes, businesses and places of worship.
NPR witnessed state government officials and police watching on as residents were beaten, attacked and forced to leave without their possessions. Reporters covering the demolition, including from Agence France- Presse, were also threatened and forced out of the community, and prevented from recording evidence of the demolitions.
Mass demolitions of largely poor inner-city or waterfront communities are common in Lagos. In 2017, Otodo-Gbame, a community of 30,000 people were evicted, despite orders prohibiting it. In Tarkwa Bay, a coastal community, close to 5,000 people were evicted in 2020.

                Residents salvage objects from houses demolished by government officials in Otodo-Gbame waterfront in Lagos Nigeria, Saturday, March 18, 2017.

In 2017, A Lagos State High Court barred the state government from evicting residents from Ilaje-Otumara and other communities in Lagos under threat of eviction without providing an alternative settlement. 
In the judgement, the Court described attempts to evict the residents as ""unconstitutional"" and ""an infringement on their fundamental right to protection from cruel and degrading treatment"".
But in February this year, state government officials returned to mark the community for demolition and gave residents 15 days to evacuate. 
On Friday residents of Ilaje-Otumara, woke up to demolition equipment and armed men, giving them only moments to collect their belongings and leave. Hundreds of residents fled clutching their belongings or carrying them away on their heads, to the surrounding streets. Heaps of personal items were left on the roadside by many with nowhere to go.

                The Lagos community of Ilaje-Otumara,  is coveted by real estate agents, with its close proximity to rich waterfront neighborhoods

Yemi Oladapo, a single mothers said she was driven away by gunmen as she tried to pick her belongings from her demolished home.  
""No notice, nothing. They didn't even give us another space to go to. And no compensation,"" she said. ""Are we not Nigerians? Are we not human beings?""
Just Empowerment Initiative, a Lagos-based rights group helping Ilaje-Otumara and several other communities, said the destruction is just the latest in a series of demolitions mainly targeting riverside communities in Lagos, which are considered prime sites for luxury housing developments. The Lagos real estate market is worth billions of dollars and over 40 percent of Lagos' real estate is investor-owned.
The community first settled there in 1920, with many families spanning multiple generations, owning government issued documents proving their rights to their land and property. But threats of eviction have intensified over the last decade. Some residents said they were resigned that the government could force them out but pleaded with officials to move them elsewhere.
45-year-old Albert Bamidele has lived in Ilaje-Otumara for 30 years, said that he had hoped that if they did face eviction, it would be done with dignity. But on Friday, that wasn't the case. 
 ""All of a sudden, we saw them this morning with bulldozers. Not even giving time. Just demolishing our property. Beating people. Carrying sticks, cultasses, other dangerous weapons. We're not even saying we won't go, don't just treat us this way.""
62-year-old Adeto Banbade was born in Ilaje-Otumara and lived in a family home in the community with her children and 85-year-old mother. She said they were forced to leave most of their possessions and had nowhere to go. 
""I've never slept on the street all my life, but now in my twilight years, this is what they've done to me.""

 LONDON – After 12 months of outperforming the rest of the world, the US market faces a potential correction, and prudent investors and business leaders are watching developments closely and hedging their risks accordingly. Amid falling consumer sentiment, sticky inflation, and rising initial jobless claims, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s closely watched GDPNow model already shows a contraction for the first quarter of 2025.

59,2025-03-07,"CEOs are using their increased leverage from the apparent softening of the labor market and economy to issue more back-to-office mandates, an executive recruiter said.
“There’s low tolerance for disgruntled employees,’’ Camille Fetter, founder & CEO of Talentfoot Executive Search & Staffing told Quartz. Workers know there’s more of a buyers’ market for labor and so they are less likely to push back, she said.
The U.S. added 151,000 jobs in February, government payrolls data showed Friday, fewer than the 160,000 economists had projected but a rise from the downwardly revised 125,000 in January. The unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 4.1% from 4.0%.
While the February jobs report wasn’t a worst-case scenario — some observers talked about a number under 100,000 — it was still the smallest gain for any February since 2019. Yesterday, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said U.S.-based employers indicated they would lay off more than 172,000 people last month, a 245% increase from January.
Nonetheless, Fetter said she’s had no searches canceled because of uncertainty arising from the trade war — even by companies with supply chains that depend on China and Mexico. Firms have woven questions about the situation into the interview process.
“They’re looking for leaders who can turn disruption into dominance,” she said. 
Companies feel well-capitalized with really strong cash positions and are focusing on revenue growth after more than a year of emphasizing profitability, Fetter said. While they’re seeking to diversify sourcing strategies, they’re not feeling a tremendous fear that would drive them to put a pause on hiring.
“We’re not seeing a knee-jerk response from the trade war” that makes companies feel like they’ve got to pull back, Fetter said. There will be more information on any trade war effects on hiring in the next month or two, she added.

63,2025-03-07,"Amid a flurry of lawsuits against his administration, Trump is trying to make it a whole lot harder to sue him.
According to a memo sent to agency heads on Thursday, the White House is encouraging the use of a rarely used rule that would force anyone who sues the federal government to pay an upfront fee.
“It is the policy of the United States to demand that parties seeking injunctions against the Federal Government must cover the costs and damages incurred if the Government is ultimately found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained,” the memo obtained by CNN reads.
More than 100 lawsuits have been filed against the president since he took office in January. The cases range from challenging his immigration policies and funding cuts, to disputes against the Department of Government Efficiency’s attack on federal agencies. Many of the cases have been successful early on, and they are all ongoing. 
In the memo, the White House framed the cases as a waste of “substantial resources to fighting frivolous suits instead of defending public safety.”
“Taxpayers are forced not only to cover the costs of their antics when funding and hiring decisions are enjoined, but must needlessly wait for Government policies they voted for,” the memo reads.
The rule the White House is attempting to invoke is rarely used in the courts, and the financial barrier could prevent individuals, organizations, unions, and agencies from taking action against the president. 
It’s unclear exactly who would decide how much the plaintiff would have to pay, but the Justice Department would probably ask judges to set the amount, legal expert Mark Zaid told CNN. 
That means the fee could be as little as $1, and as high as … who knows? It’s yet another sly move from Trump to dodge accountability for his relentless attack on the Constitution.
The president has decided to throw some weight behind one of his closest advisers when it comes to dealing with South Africa.
Despite tariff-induced tumult at home, Donald Trump took the time Friday morning to lambast South Africa for how it treats its farmers, threatening aggressive foreign policy toward the continent’s strongest economy by announcing that the United States would stop all federal funding to the African nation.
“South Africa is being terrible, plus, to long time Farmers in the country,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “They are confiscating their LAND and FARMS, and MUCH WORSE THAN THAT. A bad place to be right now, and we are stopping all Federal Funding. To go a step further, any Farmer (with family!) from South Africa, seeking to flee that country for reasons of safety, will be invited into the United States of America with a rapid pathway to Citizenship. This process will begin immediately!”
The missive came hand in hand with a complaint from Elon Musk, who whined on X mere hours before that South Africa would not allow his international internet project to get off the ground, due to a lack of diversity at the billionaire’s company.
“Starlink is not allowed to operate in South Africa, because I’m not black,” Musk posted on X Friday morning.
But that wasn’t exactly an accurate reflection of why Musk’s home country has refused to approve SpaceX’s Starlink service.
The South African government’s Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment policy stipulates that all companies that do business in the nation must have at least 30 percent of their ownership or economic involvement owned by Black South Africans.
The mandate is a part of the country’s efforts to correct inequalities left in the wake of apartheid, striving to “advance economic transformation and enhance the economic participation of black people in the South African economy,” per the South African Department of Trade, Industry, and Competition. 
Musk has practically made the notion of diversity his enemy as he works—via the Department of Government Efficiency—to strip and defund federal agencies whose missions make mention of inclusivity efforts.
“DEI is just another word for racism,” Musk wrote in January. “Shame on anyone who uses it.”
The world’s richest man’s affinity for Nazi salutes have also called into question his racial ideology, especially as a descendant of Nazi sympathizers. That is according to his father, Errol Musk, who told the Podcast and Chill Network in November that the billionaire’s maternal grandparents supported Adolf Hitler and were members of the German Nazi Party in Canada before moving to South Africa in support of apartheid.
Pete Hegseth’s Department of Defense has marked an image of the USAAF B29 bomber that dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima for deletion—and its reason may be the perfect illustration of why right now really isn’t a good time to be closing the Department of Education.
That historical image was among 26,000 that were marked for deletion as part of the  DOD’s rushed efforts to weed out any traces of so-called diversity, equity, and inclusion by Wednesday, according to the Associated Press. The photograph was marked for removal because it prominently features the name of the aircraft: Enola Gay, named for the pilot Colonel Paul Tibbetts’s mother. 
The Associated Press published a database Thursday of thousands of images marked for deletion. While some of the photographs were still visible Thursday, it’s not clear if they will remain so. One official told the AP that close to 100,000 files could be deleted as part of the Pentagon’s latest purge. 
It’s not surprising that the sweep for DEI has consequently targeted the records and achievements of women and minorities in the military, removing mentions of Women’s History Month and Black History Month. One collection of images titled “Women’s History Month: All-female crew supports warfighters” saw its main page removed, though one photograph of an all-female C-17 crew remained. Another photograph titled “Engineering pioneer remembered during Black History Month” was deleted, as well. 
Other photographs swept up in the purge included those of service members with the last name Gay, war heroes such as Marine Corps World War II Medal of Honor recipient Private First Class Harold Gonsalves, and a photograph of a group of Army Corps biologists, who appeared to have earned their spot on the chopping block because they were collecting data about fish including, among other things, their gender.
Online, people weren’t at all impressed by the Pentagon’s thoughtless CTRL-F style of searching for woke.
Former Pentagon spokesperson Chris Meagher called the report “bonkers” in a post on X Thursday. 
Rick Pearson, a political reporter for the Chicago Tribune, called the Pentagon’s purge “complete lunacy and literally an attempt to whitewash history” in a post on X.
“Republicans spent years complaining about cancel culture and then took office and banned photos of the Enola Gay because it has the word gay in it,” posted Skyler Johnson, a candidate for New York State Senate. 
“These fuckers are bigots and fucking idiots too,” wrote Army veteran Fred Wellman, who hosts the podcast On Democracy. 
“What a piece of shit you are @SecDef,” he added in a second post. 
The president’s ruthless back-and-forth on enforcing sweeping tariffs against Canada and Mexico is starting to frustrate his MAGA allies.
Last month, Trump announced he would impose a 25 percent tariff on goods from America’s closest neighbors. Two days later, he backtracked, giving Canada and Mexico a one-month delay. On March 4, the tariffs went into effect, sparking retaliatory tariffs from Canada, as well as outcry from America’s Big Three automakers. 
Two days later, Trump directed another one-month pause for goods that met his 2020 trade deal, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which a White House official told CNBC covered roughly 50 percent of Mexican imports and 38 percent of Canadian imports. And then, in an interview that aired Friday, Trump said the tariffs could go higher than 25 percent.
As a result, the last week saw drastic market fluctuations, with the stock market tumbling as the tariffs went into effect. The Dow dropped 670 points, and by the end of the week, Republican lawmakers were fed up.
“Almost every industry in Kentucky has come to me and said, ‘It will hurt our industry and push up prices of homes, cars,’ and so, I’m gonna continue to argue against tariffs,” Senator Rand Paul told CNN on Thursday.
Senator Thom Tillis agreed that the administration should back off the tariffs if they were hurting constituents.
“When we start losing, you back off. There’s such a thing as strategic retreat,” Tillis told the network. “At the end of the day, I think we have more leverage than any other nation. But we gotta be smart. And we don’t have all the leverage.”
Louisiana Senator John Kennedy told Fox Business he was “worried” about the tariffs, adding that the president should “recalibrate” if the levies start to cause inflation—while insisting that he’s not doubting Trump’s leadership.
“I’m not saying that tariffs are going to cause inflation. President Trump did them in his first term and they didn’t,” Kennedy said. “I’m saying that we just don’t know. We’re in very obscure territory. We’re in uncharted waters. I think if the tariffs do start to cause inflation, I think the president will back away from them.”
Among other tariff proposals, Trump has enforced a 10 percent tariff hike on Chinese goods. That momentarily caused a panic in February for online retailers as the postal service placed a ban on Chinese packages, which it lifted days later. Casting China as a “bulwark of stability” against a backdrop of Trump-induced chaos, the Asian nation’s top diplomat Wang Yi said that China would “definitely, resolutely counter” America’s tariffs.
Donald Trump’s attempt to take over the National Labor Relations Board hit a snag from a federal judge Thursday.
Trump’s firing of Democratic board member Gwynne A. Wilcox was ruled unlawful by U.S. District Court Judge Beryl A. Howell, who ordered Wilcox’s immediate reinstatement and for her to serve out the remainder of her five-year term on the board, which began on September 6, 2023.
In her ruling, Howell wrote that the Constitution “made clear that no one in our system of government was meant to be king—the President included—and not just in name only.
“The President does not have the authority to terminate members of the National Labor Relations Board at will, and his attempt to fire plaintiff from her position on the Board was a blatant violation of the law,” Howell said.
“A president who touts an image of himself as a ‘king’ or a ‘dictator,’ perhaps as his vision of effective leadership, fundamentally misapprehends the role under Article II of the U.S. Constitution,” Howell added.
Wilcox filed the lawsuit last month after Trump fired her and the board’s general counsel, Jennifer Abruzzo, a fellow Biden appointee, leaving the board unable to function without a quorum. In a speech after the hearing Thursday, Wilcox said, “I’m ready to get back to work.”
“It’s not just about me, but I’m glad to be the face of this fight,” Wilcox said.
Trump, Elon Musk, and the rest of the right have long targeted the NLRB, and are in fact trying to get the Supreme Court to declare it unconstitutional and dismantle it with backing from corporations including Amazon, Starbucks, and Trader Joe’s. For now, at least, the NLRB is still around, with long legal fights ahead to save it as well as Wilcox’s position. 
Just hours after he rolled back tariffs on Mexico, the president announced Canada will also not pay tariffs on any products that comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, until April 2. It’s Trump’s third flip on tariffs in 72 hours.
He signed an executive order Thursday solidifying the one-month tariff delay on products from both countries.
On Tuesday, Trump implemented 25 percent tariffs on Mexico and Canada, a disastrous move that plummeted financial markets and prompted retaliatory actions from both U.S. trading partners.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau responded aggressively, immediately implementing retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods and condemning Trump’s betrayal of a longtime ally.
“Every country is very aware that if the American government is willing to do this to their own closest ally, neighbor, and friend, everyone is vulnerable to a trade war,” Trudeau said in a press conference on Tuesday, bypassing Trump and instead speaking directly to the American people.
“Your government has chosen to put American jobs at risk at the thousands of workplaces that succeed because of materials from Canada, or because of consumers in Canada, or both.”
Trump reacted to Trudeau’s address with hostility, and yet again suggested all of Canada’s problems could be solved by becoming the fifty-first American state. His dislike for Trudeau seemingly influenced his decision-making Thursday morning, when he initially retracted tariffs only on Mexico “out of respect” for Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, but not for Canada. Trump on Wednesday also granted a one-month exemption to U.S. automobile companies.
Unsurprisingly, the president has changed his mind yet again, drawing out a trade war that will have disastrous economic consequences. 
Notorious Medicare thief and Republican Senator Rick Scott is the only one who wants to admit that his GOP colleagues are plotting to gut an essential health care program. 
During an appearance at the Rescuing the American Dream Summit in Washington Thursday, Scott said it was only a matter of time before the government would have to cut spending to “any program you care about.”
“Because Medicare is going bankrupt, Social Security is going bankrupt. You know, inflation can’t go away, interest rates can’t come down. So, my belief is that … we’re gonna have to do this,” the Florida Republican said. 
Scott knows a thing or two about bankrupting Medicare. He served as CEO of Columbia/HCA Hospital, which was fined a total of $1.7 billion in 2003 for filing false Medicare claims. At the time, it was the largest health care fraud in history, and while that particular honor has since been passed to another, Scott’s honor remains unrestored. 
Scott is one of the few Republicans who doesn’t seem to be in denial about what having approved the latest budget bill to power Donald Trump’s agenda really means. The bill requires the Committee on Energy and Commerce, which oversees Medicaid, to reduce the deficit by at least $880 billion from 2025 to 2034. Mathematically speaking, cuts that big can only come out of massive programs such as Medicaid.
Cutting the incredibly popular program will undoubtedly prove, well, unpopular, but some Republicans have another strategy: Deny, deny, deny. 
Republican Representative Brandon Gill tiptoed around the issue during an interview on Fox Business Thursday, driving host Maria Bartiromo up the wall. 
“Congressman, I mean, with all due respect, you haven’t given me one offset,” Bartiromo pressed. “OK? You say that you’re not gonna have one problem finding an offset, and so far all I’ve heard you talk about is Elon Musk’s fraud, waste, and abuse cuts, as well as eliminating climate change rules. Again, 76 percent of the money is going to mandatory spending. You know that better than anyone! I’ve got the numbers in front of me. You’ve got $36 trillion in debt.
“Isn’t it time to start looking at the mandatory spending, and trying to figure out how you’re actually gonna cut—I mean, I know nobody wants to say this, but you’ve got stuff like Medicaid, don’t you?” Bartiromo asked. 
Gill insisted he had described areas that could be cut, but noted that, “I agree with you, we are going to have to find some rationalizations.”
Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency used the U.S. Marshals to physically take over a government agency Thursday, and now that agency head is suing. 
Five employees of DOGE along with deputy acting head of the U.S. Agency for International Aid, Peter Marocco, tried to enter the U.S. African Development Foundation headquarters on Wednesday, but were prevented from getting into the building by security and were forced to leave. 
USADF staff told a security guard to deny access to the DOGE team and Marocco, who illegally entered the Capitol during the January 6 insurrection, and whom Trump is trying to install as the agency’s new chief. The agency’s employees cited a letter from the USADF’s current chair, Ward Brehm, which stated, “In my absence, I have specifically instructed the staff of USADF to adhere to our rules and procedure of not allowing any meetings of this type without my presence. 
“I will look forward to working with Mr. Marocco after such time that he is nominated for a seat on the Board and his nomination is confirmed by the Senate,” Brehm wrote in the letter. “Until these legal requirements are met, Mr. Marocco does not hold any position or office with USADF, and he may not speak or act on the Foundation’s behalf.”
On Thursday, Marocco and DOGE staffers returned to the agency—this time, with the U.S. Marshals. They were able to enter the building, which had no staff present, according to a government source.
Hours later, Brehm filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court against Marocco and DOGE, which detailed how the group initially threatened to sue the security guard barring them access, and told the building’s property manager that they would bring U.S. Marshals and Secret Service agents if they weren’t allowed into the building.
“Their threats were unsuccessful” that day, the lawsuit states. 
Marocco and DOGE staff were trying to carry out Trump’s February 19 executive order, in which he declared the USADF and three other agencies “unnecessary” and subject to elimination. The agency, created by Congress in 1980, supports small businesses and grassroots organizations helping marginalized people in Africa through grants. From 2019 to 2023, it funded 1,050 community enterprises serving 6.2 million people with $141 million in grants.
“Any attempt to unilaterally dismantle the USADF through executive action violates the law and exceeds the constitutional limits of executive authority,” wrote Democratic members of the House’s Foreign Affairs Committee in a letter to President Trump last month. 
While DOGE eventually forced its way into the agency, its chief was able to file a lawsuit before any agency staff were fired. Will the maneuver protect the agency and force the Trump administration to close it through congressional action, or is USADF only delaying the inevitable? 
California Governor Gavin Newsom shattered his reputation as an advocate for LGBTQ rights and betrayed the Democratic Party on Thursday.
In the debut episode of his new podcast, This Is Gavin Newsom, Newsom broke with his own party’s stance on trans rights and suggested that transgender athletes should not be allowed to participate in women’s sports, a spineless move from the Democrat who is likely preparing for a presidential run in 2028.
“I think it’s an issue of fairness, I completely agree with you on that. It is an issue of fairness—it’s deeply unfair,” Gavin said to his guest Charlie Kirk, a MAGA activist known for pushing Trumpism on college campuses through his organization Turning Point USA.
For decades, Newsom has been a strong supporter of LGBTQ rights, and even defied his own party by issuing same-sex marriage licenses as mayor of San Francisco in 2004, more than a decade before same-sex marriage was legal nationwide. Twenty years later, the governor is breaking with his own party yet again, this time in a weak-kneed turn to the right.
Trans athletes participating in women’s sports has long been a point of attack for Donald Trump and MAGA, and a contentious topic of debate between Democrats and Republicans. On February 5, Trump signed an executive order barring trans athletes from competing in women’s sports. The next day, the NCAA said only athletes assigned female at birth could participate in women’s competition, a heartbreaking move for trans women and nonbinary people competing in the NCAA.
In discussion with Kirk, Newsom touched on his background as a college baseball player and a father to four girls. “I revere sports, so the issue of fairness is completely legit,” Newsom said.
He went so far as to applaud the GOP for its demonization of trans people, praising Trump’s ad “Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.”
“I saw that—the last couple years, boy did I [see] how you guys were able to weaponize that issue at another level,” Newsom told Kirk.
Why the governor of California chose a 31-year-old MAGA bigot as his companion in a conversation on the rights of a marginalized community remains to be seen. But, according to the trailer for This Is Gavin Newsom, Kirk is just the first of many MAGA guests Newsom will cozy up to in the coming months.
“It’s time to have conversations with people that agree AND disagree with us,” the podcast’s description reads. “It’s time to answer the hard questions and be open to criticism, and debate, without demeaning or dehumanizing one another.” Unless, of course, those in question are trans people.
Only one Democrat had the gall to call Donald Trump out for preaching endless falsehoods during his address to a joint session of Congress—and House Republicans are planning to punish him as a result.
Ten Democrats joined Republicans Thursday in voting to censure Representative Al Green after the Texas Democrat momentarily halted Trump’s speech. 
But that was apparently not penalty enough. Hours later, the House Freedom Caucus announced it would be filing a resolution to strip Green from his committee assignments.
“We expect @SpeakerJohnson to bring it to the House floor for a vote next week,” the caucus chairman, Representative Andy Harris, posted to the extremely conservative coalition’s official X account. “Green was censured in a bipartisan vote but he needs real consequences to demonstrate that no one gets to disrupt the People’s business in lame attempts to derail President Trump’s agenda.”
When Trump claimed during his Tuesday night speech that he had been given a “mandate” by the American people to radically reimagine the federal government, Green interrupted the president by yelling, “You have no mandate to cut Medicaid!”
That got Green ousted by House Speaker Mike Johnson, who called on the sergeant of arms to remove the 77-year-old from the chamber against a backdrop of jeers from Republicans.
“I did it from my heart, and I will suffer whatever the consequences are,” Green told reporters the next day. “But truthfully, I would do it again.”
Senate Republicans are working to pass a budget that even party members have recently admitted will result in a $880 billion cut to Medicaid, much to the chagrin of their own constituents. The multibillion-dollar cut is a trade-off for conservatives who were tasked by Donald Trump to extend his 2017 tax plan, which will overwhelmingly benefit corporations and is projected to add as much as $15 trillion to the national deficit.
Green’s protest was practically the only noticeable rejection of Trump’s agenda that Democrats could muster Tuesday night. Other liberal lawmakers were torched for flipping paddles that read “False,” “Musk Steals,” “Save Medicaid,” in a silent protest in the face of the administration’s apparent oligarchy and its systemic dismantling of the federal government.
And viewers watching live at home would never have known that a handful of Democrats stood up and walked out of the chamber in protest, as TV cameras never bothered to pan to their mute, “dignified” spectacle. Others, such as Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Patty Murray, opted to not show up at all.
A CNN Poll released this week found that just 39 percent of Americans felt the country was moving in the right direction, as opposed to 45 percent who believed it was moving in the wrong direction. 
Even Republicans don’t seem to believe in the “mandate” decree coming from the White House. In Tennessee over the weekend, an angry town hall before Representative Diana Harshbarger screamed, “No!” when the Republican lawmaker asked if there had been a “mandate to the president from the American people,” who she claimed “overwhelmingly” voted Trump in.
“We’re giving the billionaires tax cuts!” a man shouted at Harshbarger."

The missive came hand in hand with a complaint from Elon Musk, who whined on X mere hours before that South Africa would not allow his international internet project to get off the ground, due to a lack of diversity at the billionaire’s company.
“Starlink is not allowed to operate in South Africa, because I’m not black,” Musk posted on X Friday morning.
But that wasn’t exactly an accurate reflection of why Musk’s home country has refused to approve SpaceX’s Starlink service.
The South African government’s Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment policy stipulates that all companies that do business in the nation must have at least 30 percent of their ownership or economic involvement owned by Black South Africans.
The mandate is a part of the country’s efforts to correct inequalities left in the wake of apartheid, striving to “advance economic transformation and enhance the economic participation of black people in the South African economy,” per the South African Department of Trade, Industry, and Competition.

One collection of images titled “Women’s History Month: All-female crew supports warfighters” saw its main page removed, though one photograph of an all-female C-17 crew remained. Another photograph titled “Engineering pioneer remembered during Black History Month” was deleted, as well. 
Other photographs swept up in the purge included those of service members with the last name Gay, war heroes such as Marine Corps World War II Medal of Honor recipient Private First Class Harold Gonsalves, and a photograph of a group of Army Corps biologists, who appeared to have earned their spot on the chopping block because they were collecting data about fish including, among other things, their gender.

Donald Trump’s attempt to take over the National Labor Relations Board hit a snag from a federal judge Thursday.
Trump’s firing of Democratic board member Gwynne A. Wilcox was ruled unlawful by U.S. District Court Judge Beryl A. Howell, who ordered Wilcox’s immediate reinstatement and for her to serve out the remainder of her five-year term on the board, which began on September 6, 2023.
In her ruling, Howell wrote that the Constitution “made clear that no one in our system of government was meant to be king—the President included—and not just in name only.
“The President does not have the authority to terminate members of the National Labor Relations Board at will, and his attempt to fire plaintiff from her position on the Board was a blatant violation of the law,” Howell said.
“A president who touts an image of himself as a ‘king’ or a ‘dictator,’ perhaps as his vision of effective leadership, fundamentally misapprehends the role under Article II of the U.S. Constitution,” Howell added.
Wilcox filed the lawsuit last month after Trump fired her and the board’s general counsel, Jennifer Abruzzo, a fellow Biden appointee, leaving the board unable to function without a quorum. In a speech after the hearing Thursday, Wilcox said, “I’m ready to get back to work.”
“It’s not just about me, but I’m glad to be the face of this fight,” Wilcox said.
Trump, Elon Musk, and the rest of the right have long targeted the NLRB, and are in fact trying to get the Supreme Court to declare it unconstitutional and dismantle it with backing from corporations including Amazon, Starbucks, and Trader Joe’s. For now, at least, the NLRB is still around, with long legal fights ahead to save it as well as Wilcox’s position. 
Just hours after he rolled back tariffs on Mexico, the president announced Canada will also not pay tariffs on any products that comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, until April 2. It’s Trump’s third flip on tariffs in 72 hours.
He signed an executive order Thursday solidifying the one-month tariff delay on products from both countries.

“Because Medicare is going bankrupt, Social Security is going bankrupt. You know, inflation can’t go away, interest rates can’t come down. So, my belief is that … we’re gonna have to do this,” the Florida Republican said. 
Scott knows a thing or two about bankrupting Medicare. He served as CEO of Columbia/HCA Hospital, which was fined a total of $1.7 billion in 2003 for filing false Medicare claims. At the time, it was the largest health care fraud in history, and while that particular honor has since been passed to another, Scott’s honor remains unrestored. 
Scott is one of the few Republicans who doesn’t seem to be in denial about what having approved the latest budget bill to power Donald Trump’s agenda really means. The bill requires the Committee on Energy and Commerce, which oversees Medicaid, to reduce the deficit by at least $880 billion from 2025 to 2034. Mathematically speaking, cuts that big can only come out of massive programs such as Medicaid.
Cutting the incredibly popular program will undoubtedly prove, well, unpopular, but some Republicans have another strategy: Deny, deny, deny. 
Republican Representative Brandon Gill tiptoed around the issue during an interview on Fox Business Thursday, driving host Maria Bartiromo up the wall. 
“Congressman, I mean, with all due respect, you haven’t given me one offset,” Bartiromo pressed. “OK? You say that you’re not gonna have one problem finding an offset, and so far all I’ve heard you talk about is Elon Musk’s fraud, waste, and abuse cuts, as well as eliminating climate change rules. Again, 76 percent of the money is going to mandatory spending. You know that better than anyone! I’ve got the numbers in front of me. You’ve got $36 trillion in debt.
“Isn’t it time to start looking at the mandatory spending, and trying to figure out how you’re actually gonna cut—I mean, I know nobody wants to say this, but you’ve got stuff like Medicaid, don’t you?” Bartiromo asked. 
Gill insisted he had described areas that could be cut, but noted that, “I agree with you, we are going to have to find some rationalizations.”
Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency used the U.S. Marshals to physically take over a government agency Thursday, and now that agency head is suing. 
Five employees of DOGE along with deputy acting head of the U.S. Agency for International Aid, Peter Marocco, tried to enter the U.S. African Development Foundation headquarters on Wednesday, but were prevented from getting into the building by security and were forced to leave. 
USADF staff told a security guard to deny access to the DOGE team and Marocco, who illegally entered the Capitol during the January 6 insurrection, and whom Trump is trying to install as the agency’s new chief. The agency’s employees cited a letter from the USADF’s current chair, Ward Brehm, which stated, “In my absence, I have specifically instructed the staff of USADF to adhere to our rules and procedure of not allowing any meetings of this type without my presence. 
“I will look forward to working with Mr. Marocco after such time that he is nominated for a seat on the Board and his nomination is confirmed by the Senate,” Brehm wrote in the letter. “Until these legal requirements are met, Mr. Marocco does not hold any position or office with USADF, and he may not speak or act on the Foundation’s behalf.”
On Thursday, Marocco and DOGE staffers returned to the agency—this time, with the U.S. Marshals. They were able to enter the building, which had no staff present, according to a government source.
Hours later, Brehm filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court against Marocco and DOGE, which detailed how the group initially threatened to sue the security guard barring them access, and told the building’s property manager that they would bring U.S. Marshals and Secret Service agents if they weren’t allowed into the building.
“Their threats were unsuccessful” that day, the lawsuit states. 
Marocco and DOGE staff were trying to carry out Trump’s February 19 executive order, in which he declared the USADF and three other agencies “unnecessary” and subject to elimination. The agency, created by Congress in 1980, supports small businesses and grassroots organizations helping marginalized people in Africa through grants. From 2019 to 2023, it funded 1,050 community enterprises serving 6.2 million people with $141 million in grants.
“Any attempt to unilaterally dismantle the USADF through executive action violates the law and exceeds the constitutional limits of executive authority,” wrote Democratic members of the House’s Foreign Affairs Committee in a letter to President Trump last month. 
While DOGE eventually forced its way into the agency, its chief was able to file a lawsuit before any agency staff were fired. Will the maneuver protect the agency and force the Trump administration to close it through congressional action, or is USADF only delaying the inevitable? 
California Governor Gavin Newsom shattered his reputation as an advocate for LGBTQ rights and betrayed the Democratic Party on Thursday.
In the debut episode of his new podcast, This Is Gavin Newsom, Newsom broke with his own party’s stance on trans rights and suggested that transgender athletes should not be allowed to participate in women’s sports, a spineless move from the Democrat who is likely preparing for a presidential run in 2028.
“I think it’s an issue of fairness, I completely agree with you on that. It is an issue of fairness—it’s deeply unfair,” Gavin said to his guest Charlie Kirk, a MAGA activist known for pushing Trumpism on college campuses through his organization Turning Point USA.
For decades, Newsom has been a strong supporter of LGBTQ rights, and even defied his own party by issuing same-sex marriage licenses as mayor of San Francisco in 2004, more than a decade before same-sex marriage was legal nationwide. Twenty years later, the governor is breaking with his own party yet again, this time in a weak-kneed turn to the right.
Trans athletes participating in women’s sports has long been a point of attack for Donald Trump and MAGA, and a contentious topic of debate between Democrats and Republicans. On February 5, Trump signed an executive order barring trans athletes from competing in women’s sports. The next day, the NCAA said only athletes assigned female at birth could participate in women’s competition, a heartbreaking move for trans women and nonbinary people competing in the NCAA.
In discussion with Kirk, Newsom touched on his background as a college baseball player and a father to four girls. “I revere sports, so the issue of fairness is completely legit,” Newsom said.
He went so far as to applaud the GOP for its demonization of trans people, praising Trump’s ad “Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.”
“I saw that—the last couple years, boy did I [see] how you guys were able to weaponize that issue at another level,” Newsom told Kirk.
Why the governor of California chose a 31-year-old MAGA bigot as his companion in a conversation on the rights of a marginalized community remains to be seen. But, according to the trailer for This Is Gavin Newsom, Kirk is just the first of many MAGA guests Newsom will cozy up to in the coming months.
“It’s time to have conversations with people that agree AND disagree with us,” the podcast’s description reads. “It’s time to answer the hard questions and be open to criticism, and debate, without demeaning or dehumanizing one another.” Unless, of course, those in question are trans people.
Only one Democrat had the gall to call Donald Trump out for preaching endless falsehoods during his address to a joint session of Congress—and House Republicans are planning to punish him as a result.
Ten Democrats joined Republicans Thursday in voting to censure Representative Al Green after the Texas Democrat momentarily halted Trump’s speech. 
But that was apparently not penalty enough. Hours later, the House Freedom Caucus announced it would be filing a resolution to strip Green from his committee assignments.
“We expect @SpeakerJohnson to bring it to the House floor for a vote next week,” the caucus chairman, Representative Andy Harris, posted to the extremely conservative coalition’s official X account. “Green was censured in a bipartisan vote but he needs real consequences to demonstrate that no one gets to disrupt the People’s business in lame attempts to derail President Trump’s agenda.”
When Trump claimed during his Tuesday night speech that he had been given a “mandate” by the American people to radically reimagine the federal government, Green interrupted the president by yelling, “You have no mandate to cut Medicaid!”
That got Green ousted by House Speaker Mike Johnson, who called on the sergeant of arms to remove the 77-year-old from the chamber against a backdrop of jeers from Republicans.
“I did it from my heart, and I will suffer whatever the consequences are,” Green told reporters the next day. “But truthfully, I would do it again.”
Senate Republicans are working to pass a budget that even party members have recently admitted will result in a $880 billion cut to Medicaid, much to the chagrin of their own constituents. The multibillion-dollar cut is a trade-off for conservatives who were tasked by Donald Trump to extend his 2017 tax plan, which will overwhelmingly benefit corporations and is projected to add as much as $15 trillion to the national deficit.
Green’s protest was practically the only noticeable rejection of Trump’s agenda that Democrats could muster Tuesday night. Other liberal lawmakers were torched for flipping paddles that read “False,” “Musk Steals,” “Save Medicaid,” in a silent protest in the face of the administration’s apparent oligarchy and its systemic dismantling of the federal government.
And viewers watching live at home would never have known that a handful of Democrats stood up and walked out of the chamber in protest, as TV cameras never bothered to pan to their mute, “dignified” spectacle. Others, such as Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Patty Murray, opted to not show up at all.
A CNN Poll released this week found that just 39 percent of Americans felt the country was moving in the right direction, as opposed to 45 percent who believed it was moving in the wrong direction. 
Even Republicans don’t seem to believe in the “mandate” decree coming from the White House. In Tennessee over the weekend, an angry town hall before Representative Diana Harshbarger screamed, “No!” when the Republican lawmaker asked if there had been a “mandate to the president from the American people,” who she claimed “overwhelmingly” voted Trump in.
“We’re giving the billionaires tax cuts!” a man shouted at Harshbarger.
The United States’ new alignment with Russia is causing some of our longest allies to question if they should continue to share military intelligence with Washington.
Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the four other members of the Five Eyes spy alliance—Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom—are reportedly examining how they could revise their current protocols with Washington in order to safeguard foreign assets, according to four sources and a foreign official that spoke with NBC News.
“Those discussions are already happening,” one source with direct knowledge of the conversations told NBC. No actions have been taken as of yet.
“Every intelligence agency treats its commitments to foreign agents as sacrosanct, pledging to keep agents safe and shield their identities,” NBC reported. “Anything that jeopardized that obligation would violate that trust, former officials said, and that could lead some spy services to hold back on some information sharing with Washington.”
Decisions over whether to continue to include America in international intelligence alliances come part and parcel as countries around the globe question their economic, military, and diplomatic cooperation with Washington.
Droves of world leaders have denounced the U.S. in the weeks since Donald Trump was inaugurated. They have condemned his administration’s decision to backtrack on international treaties, his aggression toward the U.S.’s longstanding alliances, and his willingness to throw Western nations into a reckless trade war, and have cast aspersions on his seemingly warm relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
While withholding intelligence from the Pentagon would prove to be a drastic shift in world relations, it would also be little more than a reflection of Trump’s own foreign policy approach that has thrown the Western world into tumult in a matter of days.
Following a disastrous meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Friday, in which Trump and Vice President JD Vance effectively challenged the U.S.’s strongest alliances while ceding the world stage to America’s adversaries, the White House has ordered a pause on military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv in its ongoing war with Russia. That alone is expected to devastate Ukraine’s ability to target Russian forces in its fight against the dictator-led superpower.
Trump has repeatedly ducked reporters’ questions as to whether his administration’s actions have aligned U.S. policy with Moscow. 
Several of Trump’s former advisers have criticized Trump’s approach to ending the war, including two of his first term national security advisers H.R. McMaster and John Bolton. 
“Vladimir Putin couldn’t be happier,” McMaster told 60 Minutes on Sunday, sizing up the events of Trump’s explosive meeting with Zelenskiy “Because what he sees is all of the pressure on Zelensky, all of the pressure on Ukraine and no pressure on him.”
McMaster then went on to describe Putin as a “master manipulator” who had successfully worked Trump to Russia’s advantage."

If 2023 was marked by resilience and 2024 brought a long-awaited shift in monetary policy, 2025 stands to be remembered as the “Great Moderation.” This year’s outlook reflects an economy and markets normalizing after years of volatility stemming from the pandemic and its aftermath. For financial advisors and wealth managers, the forecast underscores the importance of diversification and forward-thinking strategies in navigating these transitions.
The Federal Reserve transitioned from foe to friend in late 2024, beginning its rate-cutting cycle with a surprise 0.5% reduction in September. This marked a pivot from the prolonged period of restrictive monetary policy aimed at curbing inflation. As inflation continues its decline toward the Fed’s 2% target, economic growth has moderated. While recession fears persist, particularly given a softening labor market, the resilience of the consumer and ongoing fiscal stimulus have tempered downturn risks.
Historical data suggests caution: Rising unemployment rates and a reversion of the yield curve often precede recessions. However, the labor market remains stable enough to sustain consumer spending, the backbone of the U.S. economy. Baby Boomers, with their significant net wealth and spending power, may also provide an unexpected tailwind to economic activity.
In 2024, equity markets saw concentrated performance, with a handful of mega-cap stocks driving the S&P 500s gains. In 2025, I anticipate a shift toward greater market breadth as smaller companies, international equities and underperforming sectors gain traction. Valuations for U.S. large-cap stocks remain elevated, fueled by optimism about future earnings growth and productivity gains driven by robotics and artificial intelligence.
For diversified portfolios, this normalization presents an opportunity. Sectors and geographies that have lagged in recent years—such as small- and mid-cap stocks, international equities and emerging markets—could deliver stronger relative performance as interest rates decline and currency trends shift.
Advisors should caution clients against ""rearview mirror investing,"" where past high performers dominate allocation decisions. Instead, focus on the potential of sectors and asset classes poised for growth in a lower-rate environment.
The bond market, which endured prolonged yield curve inversion, is expected to see normalization as rates continue to moderate. The Treasury curve may have already begun to steepen, and further Fed rate cuts should reduce short-term yields while providing stability across longer maturities.
Municipal bonds, despite low yield spreads relative to Treasurys, remain attractive for taxable investors due to their tax benefits. Similarly, high-yield bonds are presenting tight spreads, indicating minimal recession concerns among fixed-income investors. However, advisors should remain mindful of potential volatility tied to inflation surprises, geopolitical risks and shifts in fiscal policy.
With yields on savings accounts and money markets likely to decline, bonds may regain favor as an alternative for investors seeking higher returns. A balanced allocation to fixed income can provide a hedge against equity volatility while offering modest capital appreciation.
Globally, the story of 2025 mirrors that of the U.S.: moderation and normalization. Eurozone economies are expected to show slight improvement, supported by easing energy prices and potential geopolitical resolutions. In Asia, China continues to manage a two-speed economy, balancing export growth with domestic consumption struggles. Meanwhile, emerging markets such as India and Mexico benefit from U.S. efforts to diversify supply chains away from China.
These dynamics present opportunities for diversification. International equities, often overlooked by U.S. investors, could outperform as global growth stabilizes and currency effects shift. With valuations in many international markets closer to historical averages, advisors should explore the potential benefits of global exposure.
For financial advisors, this 2025 forecast reinforces key principles for managing client portfolios in a changing market environment:
The market forecast for 2025 suggests a year of transition and normalization. While moderation is the prevailing theme, financial advisors must remain vigilant, balancing optimism with caution. By focusing on diversification, forward-thinking strategies and client education, advisors can help clients navigate the complexities of a moderating economy and position their portfolios for long-term success.

Market trends are strong engines of creativity, expansion and financial success. They give businesses and entrepreneurs windows of opportunity to establish their brands and gain traction and a competitive edge. It takes a strategic combination of observation, analysis and action to spot these trends early and take advantage of them.
A few years ago, I attended an industry conference where a casual conversation led to a game-changing realization. A fellow entrepreneur shared how they leveraged emerging networking trends—strategic LinkedIn outreach, virtual communities and industry roundtables—to tap into new markets before competitors even noticed the shift. Inspired, I started actively engaging in these spaces, building relationships with key players and spotting trends before they went mainstream. The impact was undeniable: new partnerships, early access to market insights and a steady stream of opportunities that transformed my business.
This experience taught me how strategic networking can help you identify and capitalize on emerging market trends. Now, I wish to share the lessons I learned so that leaders can stay ahead in an ever-evolving business landscape.
Global economic movements, technological developments and changes in consumer behavior are all observed in market trends. Businesses can innovate, adjust and meet changing demands by recognizing these trends. Businesses that don't identify trends early risk going out of business. We've seen that companies like Amazon, Zoom and Tesla have dominated their industries by leveraging new trends like e-commerce, remote work and a desire to utilize renewable energy.
The modern world offers a wealth of information, but it requires discernment to filter relevant insights. Be sure to:
1. Follow industry leaders via social media and their newsletters.
2. Use data analytics, move beyond intuition, and make informed decisions.
3. Monitor consumer behavior with Google Trends and other tools.
4. Observe social media conversations on Twitter, Reddit and Instagram, as these are gold mines for consumer sentiments.
Direct human interaction is the core of identifying market trends. Networking allows you to tap into the collective wisdom of peers, customers and competitors. Go to trade shows, conferences and seminars, as these are fertile grounds for discovering innovations and gauging market sentiment. These events bring together thought leaders, vendors and customers in one place. Also, explore platforms like Quora and Reddit; these forums often host discussions on emerging ideas and unmet needs. You can pick some ideas to capitalize on. Partnerships with startups, researchers or even competitors expose you to new technologies and methodologies that may redefine your industry.
However, emerging trends are not confined to specific industries or regions. Often, innovations in one sector inspire changes in others. For example, the success of subscription-based models in entertainment (e.g., Netflix) has influenced industries like gaming, software and even consumer goods. Technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence and renewable energy often serve as platforms for multiple applications across industries. Staying ahead of such advancements can reveal opportunities for diversification or innovation. Societal values and cultural movements also play a significant role in shaping demand. For instance, the growing emphasis on mental health has spurred industries like wellness apps, teletherapy and self-care products.
Some trends are fleeting fads, while others represent deeper, more sustainable shifts. Validation ensures that you’re investing your resources in viable opportunities. But how do you validate and test the trends first?
Determine whether the trend has long-term potential or is a temporary craze. To validate a trend, keep an eye on details that could signal its viability over the long term. Trends rooted in fundamental changes like demographic shifts or technological progress are more likely to stay, and the trends based on fashion are cyclic, but their time is short.
Being an entrepreneur, your responsibility is to research and complete the homework. There are a few things that can help you. For example, see how other businesses are addressing the trend. Look for gaps or underserved segments where your business can differentiate itself.
Once you’ve identified and validated a trend, the next step is to act. Execution is where most businesses either succeed or falter. Tailor your product or services to address specific pain points within the trend. For example, if sustainability is the trend, launch eco-friendly materials or carbon-neutral processes. The recent emergence of sustainable energy resources gave us a lesson to capitalize on the trend in time.
What does digital transformation have to do with it?
Digital tools and platforms are indispensable for acing emerging trends. To engage the trend-conscious consumers, you need to have a strong online presence with the following things ready:
• Optimize your online presence everywhere.
• Have a responsive website.
• Keep social media accounts active.
• Utilize targeted advertising.
• Automate repetitive tasks.
• Use AI for analytics.
Both art and science go into spotting and profiting from new market trends. It needs a proactive strategy that combines strategic execution, data analysis and observation. Companies that succeed in this area establish themselves as leaders in their sectors and remain relevant. The ability to adjust to change and predict the demands of future consumers is essential for success. To turn market trends into long-lasting, profitable ventures you only need to stay informed and validate opportunities.

D.R. Horton Inc. signage stands in front of homes under construction at the Eastridge Woods ... [+] development in Cottage Grove, Minnesota, U.S., on Friday, Oct. 19, 2018. D.R. Horton Inc. is scheduled to release earning figures on November 7th. Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg
Earnings season and economic news got you feeling flipped upside down? Throw in the latest GDP data and the Fed’s newly cautious approach to rate cuts moving forward, and it’s enough datapoints to make your head spin.
Looking for ideas you can trust during earnings season? I’ve got you covered.
My firm cuts through the cheerleading and hype from the media and Wall Street. I dig past the headiness with the first and best AI for investing. My firm’s proven-superior Stock Ratings find undervalued gems even in a market filled with overvalued stocks.
There are not many good stocks left in the market these days. Did you know less than 4% of my firm’s coverage universe gets a very attractive Rating? Only ~9% more get an attractive Rating.
This week’s Long Idea is one of those few. I first made D.R. Horton (DHI) a Long Idea in April 2020 and most recently reiterated my thesis on the stock in January 2024. Since my original report, the stock is up 242% while the S&P 500 is up 111%.
My thesis highlighted D.R. Horton’s long track record of profit growth, healthy balance sheet, top-tier profitability and return on invested capital (ROIC), and its leadership in affordable homes. Today, my thesis remains intact, and the stock remains undervalued.
The housing industry, despite the ongoing deficit of available homes and, in particular, affordable homes has recently been dogged by consumer’s hesitance to purchase, in large part due to high interest rates and inflation.
However, as the largest homebuilder in the U.S. for the last 23 years, D.R. Horton is able to leverage its diverse product offerings, coupled with incentives and lower home sale prices, to continue to grow its market share.
In 2024, the company closed more than 93,000 homes, compared to just under 91,000 in 2023 and just under 18,000 in 2011.
Figure 1: D.R. Horton’s Rising Market Share: 1993 – 2024
DHI Market Share 1993-2024
As of the end of 2024, D.R. Horton builds approximately one out of seven new single-family homes in the U.S.
The company ranks as the largest homebuilder in five of the top seven U.S. housing markets and in 61 of the 125 markets in which it operates. As the clear industry leader, D.R. Horton is well-positioned to benefit should rates decline and affordability rise.
D.R. Horton also operates one of the most efficient companies in the homebuilder industry. It combines both scale and profitability.
Over the trailing twelve months (TTM), the company is tied for the second highest return on invested capital (ROIC) compared to its publicly-traded peers. To achieve such an ROIC, D.R. Horton is particularly efficient with its balance sheet, as it has the highest invested capital turns of its peer group, which includes PulteGroup (PHM), Meritage Homes (MTH), Toll Brothers (TOL), Lennar (LEN), and KB Home (KBH), as shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2: D.R. Horton’s Profitability Vs. Peers – TTM
DHI Profitability Vs Peers
D.R. Horton has grown revenue and net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) by 16% and 21% compounded annually, respectively, since fiscal 2014. The company’s NOPAT margin improved from 8% in fiscal 2014 to 12% in the trailing-twelve-months (TTM), while invested capital turns increased from 1.1 to 1.4 over the same time. Rising NOPAT margins and invested capital turns drive the company’s ROIC from 9% in fiscal 2014 to 17% in the TTM. See Figure 3. Even though NOPAT has fallen after a record 2022, D.R. Horton’s TTM NOPAT is still higher than any annual period in company history outside of fiscal 2022-2024.
Figure 3: D.R. Horton’s Revenue and NOPAT: Fiscal 2014 – TTM
DHI Revenue And NOPAT 2014-TTM
Since fiscal 2018, D.R. Horton has paid $2.1 billion (5% of market cap) in cumulative dividends and has increased its quarterly dividends from $0.13/share in February 2018 to $0.40/share in February 2025. The company’s current dividend, when annualized, provides a 1.1% yield.
While D.R. Horton has consistently increased its dividend, the bulk of capital returned to shareholders comes through share repurchases. From fiscal 2018 through fiscal 1Q25, the company repurchased $7.0 billion (15% of market cap) worth of shares. It would appear management believes the stock is cheap at current levels, as $5.2 billion of these repurchases have occurred since fiscal 2022. In fiscal 1Q25, the company repurchased $1.1 billion, which is up from $377 million in fiscal 1Q24. On the 1Q25 earnings call, management noted that “as our stock price declined during the quarter, we accelerated some of our planned share repurchases.”
In July 2024, D.R. Horton’s Board of Directors authorized a $4 billion share repurchase program with no expiration date. As of December 2024, there are $2.5 billion remaining under the current authorization. Management noted on the 1Q25 earnings call that it expects to repurchase $2.6 and $2.8 billion in 2025. Netting out the $1.1 billion repurchased in 1Q25, this statement implies the company will repurchase and additional $1.6 billion (based on the midpoint repurchase estimate) in 2025. A $1.6 billion repurchase is 3.5% of the current market cap, and when combined with the dividend yield, could provide investors a 4.6% yield on shares.
Best of all, D.R. Horton’s free cash flow (FCF) easily exceeds its regular dividend payments. From fiscal 2018 through fiscal 1Q25, the company has generated $9.4 billion in FCF while paying $2.1 billion in dividends. Combined, the company has repurchased shares and paid dividends worth $9.1 billion over the same time.
D.R. Horton has generated a cumulative $9.4 billion in free cash flow, which equals 21% of its enterprise value. The company’s large and rising FCF shows the company’s ability to grow while running one of the most profitable businesses in the industry even when margins are being pressured.
Figure 4: D.R. Horton’s FCF: Fiscal 2018 – Fiscal 1Q25
DHI Cumulative FCF 2018-1Q25
One of the reasons D.R. Horton can maintain its industry leading position throughout economic cycles is its strong balance sheet. D.R. Horton earns a very attractive Overall Credit Rating, and all five criteria that drive my Credit Ratings also score very attractive. Even if economic conditions deteriorate, the company’s strong financial footing secures its operations for the foreseeable future.
Figure 5: D.R. Horton’s Credit Rating Details
DHI Credit Rating Details 
D.R. Horton continued to use incentives and lower home sale prices to attract buyers in 2024, as persistently high interest rates make home affordability more difficult. While these actions spur higher demand and address affordability, they also impact the company’s margins. The company’s reported annual home sales gross margin has fallen from 27% in fiscal 1Q22 to 23% in fiscal 1Q25. NOPAT margins follow a similar trend.
Going forward, management says “incentive costs are expected to increase further on homes closed over the next few months so we expect our home sales gross margin to be lower in the second quarter compared to the first quarter”, so margin pressure will not abate in the near-term.
The construction industry is well-known as one of the largest employers of undocumented workers. It remains to be seen how President Trump’s focus on illegal immigration and ongoing deportations will impact the construction sector as a whole, and D.R. Horton’s management is taking a cautious approach. At the moment, management notes that they’re “seeing good access” to the labor they need and that they don’t expect to “see much inflation in either [labor or parts] over the next 12 months.” Management further notes that they’ve had to handle shifting immigration in the past and would expect any impact to be more regional rather than “sweeping across our entire footprint.”
The good news for investors is that D.R. Horton doesn’t need to improve margins for its stock to hold potential upside. At its current price, D.R. Horton’s price-to-economic book value (PEBV) ratio is 1.0, which means the market expects its NOPAT to never grow from current levels.
Below, I use my reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model to quantify the cash flow expectations for different stock price scenarios for D.R. Horton.
In the first scenario, I quantify the expectations baked into the current price. If I assume:
the stock would be worth $144/share today – nearly equal to the current stock price. In this scenario, D.R. Horton’s NOPAT grows just 1% compounded annually through fiscal 2034. For reference, D.R. Horton has grown NOPAT by 21% compounded annually over the past 10 years and 8% compounded annually over the past two decades.
Even if I assume:
the stock would be worth $178/share today – a 24% upside to the current price.
In this scenario, D.R. Horton’ NOPAT grows just 3% compounded annually through fiscal 2034. Should the company’s NOPAT grow more in line with historical levels, the stock has even more upside. See Figure 6.

U.S. equity markets have been choppy and rangebound since the election, with the S&P 500 Index ping-ponging in a roughly 175-point range. With an ongoing market leadership tug-of-war limiting a decisive breakout, some investors are questioning if the current rally’s best days are behind it and whether this is as good as it gets.
Unsurprisingly, this rudderless period for markets has coincided with the emergence of an economic soft patch. A key driver of this weakness has been a surge in policy uncertainty, particularly on the tariff front. Both the Conference Board and University of Michigan consumer surveys have now more than fully retraced their post-election bounces. Further, the potential for higher prices has caused near-term inflation expectations to climb in both survey data as well as market-priced instruments. For example, in February the 1-Year zero coupon inflation swap reached its highest level since March 2023, when CPI inflation was still 5% and we were less than 12 months removed from the 9.1% peak.
Investor sentiment has started to sour too, with the AAII Bull-Bear Spread notching one of its 10 worst readings in its nearly 40-year history last week. While some may be debating repositioning their portfolios more defensively, we do not yet believe such action is warranted. For starters, the AAII Bull-Bear Spread has historically been a contra indicator, with extreme bearish readings giving way to elevated market returns. In fact, when the survey output has been in the bottom decile (most bearish) like today, the S&P 500 has historically delivered a 13.6% return on average over the subsequent 12 months.
Furthermore, a period of market choppiness was not entirely unexpected coming into the year. Following 2024’s strength, many (including us) called for a period of digestion that now appears to be playing out. Importantly, this digestion has coincided with a broadening of market participation, with the S&P 500 equal weight index outperforming the cap weighted version by 1.4% year to date. This is an encouraging development for active managers, who have a larger opportunity set when market participation is broader.
We expect policy uncertainty to ebb in the coming months, giving way to the more investor-friendly elements of the new administration’s agenda such as deregulation and tax cuts. While policy headlines have come at a fast and furious pace over the past several weeks, cutting through the noise shows that the underlying fundamentals are often less dire than the headlines suggest. For example, about 77,000 federal workers have accepted the Department of Government Efficiency buyout so far, which keeps them on the payroll for the next six months. Importantly, this is roughly one-third the number of workers in the U.S. that file for unemployment benefits for the first time in any given week. Put differently, the scale of government workforce reductions so far appears digestible and represents more of a modest economic headwind than a shift in trajectory.
That said, one development worth monitoring is the jump in initial jobless claims during the last week of February. A rise in newly fired workers tends to foreshadow a slowdown in consumption and ultimately can lead to a recession. Importantly, last week’s jump does not appear to be a sign of more widespread DOGE-related layoffs, as initial claims actually fell in total across the three areas most likely to be impacted by cutbacks in government spending: the District of Columbia, Virginia and Maryland. While the catalyst for the recent move higher remains unknown, jobless claims remain firmly in what is considered expansion territory, suggesting that fretting over labor market weakness is premature.
The confidence crisis from policy uncertainty has recently begun to impact business sentiment as well as consumer and investor sentiment. The ISM manufacturing survey slipped slightly in February amid a number of comments within the report citing tariffs. However, the internals of the report were less supportive, with the New Orders sub-component falling from 55.1 to 48.6. This step backward for manufacturing is a good reminder that economic conditions do not move in a straight line. While some warning signs may be re-emerging, overall recession risks remain muted.
Decreased confidence and choppy markets reflect the increased possibility of unfavorable outcomes emerging, a risk bolstered by the emergence of a budding economic soft patch. While historically this has been concerning, the signal value from consumer surveys has been diluted in the post-pandemic world as weak sentiment has not translated to weak spending over the past several years. Put differently, today you need to watch what consumers do, not just what they say.
The consumer has been on solid footing, supported by a strong labor market and healthy individual balance sheets. Furthermore, extreme weather has likely distorted the true pace of U.S. economic momentum with the country experiencing its coldest January since 1988. As more clarity emerges in the coming months, and importantly as positive policy dynamics such as the extension of tax cuts come into view, confidence is likely to be bolstered and economic growth expectations should improve.

President Trump signed an executive order last night to create a strategic bitcoin reserve. The move is a major step toward his campaign promise of making the U.S. the ""crypto capital of the planet."" He's expected to speak today about the reserve at a White House summit on cryptocurrency. 
The first phase of the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas ended without any agreement on next steps. Trump has said his previous threats forced the ceasefire that began six weeks ago. This week, Trump issued his ""last warning"" to Hamas after meeting with former Israeli hostages. 
President Trump joked that ""nobody has ever heard of"" the southern African nation of Lesotho during his address to Congress on Tuesday night. He was defending his administration's humanitarian aid cuts to different countries, including Lesotho. The country's foreign minister, Lejone Mpotjoane, says the U.S. government has an embassy in his country, and the two countries have had ""a long cooperation."" Mpotjoane invited Trump to visit the country.

Our beauty editors don’t give out praise lightly, so when I heard one raving about a neck-firming serum with results so good they made her gasp, I knew this product was no joke.
The ShapeShift V-Line Jaw Defining Serum uses exosomes to alter your skin on the cellular level, reducing the appearance of wrinkles and crepey skin and creating a more sculpted neck and jawline.
And in case you’re feeling skeptical, biotech beauty brand SickScience has science (and some very impressive before and after photos) to back it.
The serum sold out multiple times after the initial launch in March 2024, but I finally got my hands on it late last year—and (spoiler alert:) I love it so much I begged the brand for an exclusive discount so you can try it for yourself. Use code MBG20 to get 20% off your order.
But don't waffle over your purchase for too long! Some reviewers say they're stocking up on multiples so they're never without it, and I'm predicting more sellouts in this brand's future.
SickScience ShapeShift V-Line Jaw Defining Serum
For starters, the founders Polen Koçak, Ph.D., and Merve Yildirim, Ph.D., are (literally) molecular scientists, so you know they’re meticulous in creating each formula.
Rather than a harsh or potent exfoliator, ShapeShift uses exosomes (compounds extracted from plant-based stem cells) to harness the power of your DNA and encourage a smoother, more contoured neck area. 
More specifically, the exomes (called NX35) specifically instruct fat cells to naturally release lipid droplets, which are responsible for fat storage. The serum also contains glycerin, niacinamide, squalane, and ceramides, which are naturally hydrating and plumping. 
I’ve now used the serum for about three months, and the skin on my neck looks so much firmer and smoother. I love that it’s lightweight, non-irritating, vegan, hypoallergenic, and fragrance-free, and it’s simple to integrate into my existing skin care routine.
Fun fact: The brand was founded by molecular scientists, and they've done their research on this product. In a third-party clinical study of 31 volunteers for eight weeks, 90% of participants reported increased firmness of the skin, and 94% said their skin felt smoother after using the serum.
Co-founder Polen Koçak's own eight-week outcome (below) still has me shook. 
Our aforementioned senior beauty editor, Jamie Schneider, said the serum made her neck and jaw look “more defined than ever” after about four weeks of testing the serum.
The best part? While most exosome serums I’ve seen cost well over $200, this one is just $58 for a fairly large bottle—and you can get it for $46 with code MBG20.
SickScience ShapeShift V-Line Jaw Defining Serum
Exosome products are making waves in the skin care space, and this is one formula I can strongly recommend firsthand (yup, even as someone with sensitive skin!). Don't miss your chance to try it for yourself and save 20% with code MBG20 to get 20% off your order.

77,2025-03-07,"MWC 2025 was full of interesting devices and concepts.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

MWC 2025 has come and gone, and while we could only choose a select few products in our Best of MWC 2025, that doesn't mean there was a shortage of interesting and even straight-up weird devices. That's where this list comes in, as Android Central's Derrek Lee and Harish Jonnalagadda list out some of the coolest (and weirdest) devices at MWC 2025.

The Spark Slim is one of the most impressive devices at the show. Not only does it have an incredibly sleek design, but the phone measures just 5.75mm in thickness. What's amazing about this is that TECNO managed to squeeze a fairly large 5,200mAh battery into the phone, which is larger than the battery powering the rather massive Galaxy S25 Ultra.
The design looks like a futuristic Nexus, with a camera bar spanning the top of the phone and LEDs and unibody ceramic or stainless steel rear panels, both of which look better than most phones on the market today. For now, the phone is just a concept, but with the renewed interest in thin phones this year, we hope it arrives sooner rather than later.

So-called ""tri-fold"" phones are slowly becoming a thing, but this device does things a little differently. Instead of a large phone opening to a tablet-sized device, this Samsung Display concept takes the flip form factor and flips the script... again. Instead of folding two halves together, this phone folds in two separate sections, which closes the phone like you would close your fist.
Even more unique is the fact that it leaves a section of the display visible when the phone is closed, allowing the user to view notifications or the like from the small sliver of the screen. It's by far one of the weirdest designs we've seen.

Realme showcased the Ultra at MWC 2025, and the main highlight of the device is that it has a 1-inch sensor — much like the Xiaomi 15 Ultra and other Chinese rivals. However, unlike all of those phones, Realme managed to add a mount to the back of the Ultra, allowing you to attach standard camera lenses to the phone. It is a neat idea, and Realme had a 10x lens that allowed the device to take lossless images at that zoom factor. As you'd imagine, the camera lens is absolutely massive, but it is usable — more so than I initially imagined.

Obviously, this isn't a retail product yet, but Realme has indicated that it will start selling a variant of the phone to consumers at some point. The lens that Realme showcased had a custom mount, but if the brand is able to deliver a retail device that works with standard Sony, Canon, or Nikon lens mounts, it would make the phone so much more versatile as a camera package.

Xiaomi also tried its hand at attaching a lens to the back of its phone — in this case, a custom Xiaomi 15 — and unlike Realme, it bolted on magnetic ring with pogo pins to the back of the device to facilitate the lens. The result is a cleaner look, and you can use the main cameras in addition to the lens attachment. The lens itself is considerably shorter than most traditional DSLR lenses, and the 35mm focal length is ideal for shooting in day-to-day scenarios.
Xiaomi says the pogo pins make it near-instantaneous to transfer imagery data to the device, and I like the idea of being able to attach lenses to the back of an existing phone. Xiaomi didn't say if it would put this idea into production, but it is possible we may see something along these lines on the next Ultra device.

Samsung knows how to make standout foldable OLED panels, and at MWC, Samsung Display showcased what's on the horizon. The star attraction is a handheld console with a foldable panel; it bends in the middle similar to the Galaxy Z Fold 6, and it is an undoubtedly cool idea. The demo unit was just to highlight the panel, so it wasn't a full-fledged console as such, but I'm excited to see one of the many handheld brands try to leverage this design — I would love to use a foldable Steam Deck.
Samsung also highlighted its Flex G and Flex S designs; these are foldable panels aimed at tri-folding and multi-folding devices, and while it is unlikely we'll see Samsung release phones that use these OLED panels anytime soon, it's great to see that the tech itself is available.

I'm thoroughly enjoying using my Huawei Mate XT, and the tri-folding device is holding up much better than I imagined. Tecno demoed its own tri-folding device at MWC, and it is pretty great in its own right. While it isn't as sleek as the Mate XT, it has a usable tri-folding design, and it also extends to a tablet-sized panel.
Tecno didn't detail much about the device, but the one advantage it has over the Mate XT is that it has Google's Play Store and associated mobile services installed out of the box. Like the Tecno Spark Slim, the brand doesn't have any plans to introduce this device as a retail offering at this moment in time, but I want that to change.

Mudra Link is a unique gesture control wristband that leverages neural signals to drive interactions. It connects via Bluetooth, and in the MWC 2025 demo, it was paired to a Mac Mini and was able to control the volume and play a virtual violin instrument. There's also a Mudra Band that can be used with the Apple Watch, giving you the ability to control the Apple TV from your wrist. Mudra says it's working with XR device manufacturers to integrate the Link with their devices, and that sounds interesting to say the least.

Infinix had one of the coolest demos at MWC 2025, with its E-Color Shift 2.0 phone featuring a color E Ink panel at the back that changes colors dynamically. There's the option to change colors to custom patterns or designs, and you can also tweak the back colors to reflect the weather, your mood, or even an emoji. It did a great job changing colors on the fly, and the use of E Ink at the back to do so is a novel idea.
Infinix says it is mulling debuting a phone with similar tech, but there are no plans to bring this particular device to market. Even then, I'm positive another brand will see what Infinix did here and will try to leverage the same idea in its own device.

As an honoree for best AI innovation at MWC, Honor is doing a very interesting thing with its AI. The company had a robotic hand on display that onlookers could interact with. Paxini includes a camera that can view your hand and then replicate your movements. A computer was set up to stream the feed from Paxini so you can see how it's analyzing your hand's movements. It wasn't immediately clear what Honor planned to do with the hand, but there's no doubt there could be plenty of uses for something like this.

With the adoption of telephoto lenses on smartphones, we're finally graduating from the era of digital-only zoom. ZTE is taking things a step further with the Nubia Focus 2 Ultra, which features a ring around the camera housing that can be physically rotated to control the zoom. ZTE says the Focus 2 Ultra has a 108MP primary camera and five focal lengths. With the zoom ring, users can close in on a subject up to 10x, and you even get a camera button to complete the package, making this the ultimate camera phone.

We love smart glasses here, and if you're a cyclist, then these glasses are for you. Not only do they look cool, but there's a 16MP camera in the middle that is capable of capturing smooth 1080p video for up to four hours. What's cool is that they use AI to create automatic highlights within the app, and then you can stitch the clips together for an ultimate highlight video, complete with your route and stats like speed, distance, and duration. Plus, there's a great set of open-ear surround-sound speakers to keep you both entertained and aware of your surroundings.

Android has had a few goes at a true FaceID competitor, but nothing has really stuck. Metalenz is trying to change that with Polar ID, which uses the company's technology to not only make traditional camera stacks smaller and smarter but also bring FaceID-levels of biometric security to Android phones. It appears to be much more secure than what's available on phones like the Google Pixel and is even smart enough not to be fooled by masks or even a 3D printout of someone's face.
Polar ID is supported on flagship Snapdragon chips, and the company is talking to OEMs now, so hopefully, we'll be seeing this tech on our next smartphones.

RayNeo is doing all the right things in the XR category, and the X3 Pro is definitely interesting. The AR glasses use a micro-LED light engine and go up to 2500 nits, and there's a camera at the front that lets you record photos and videos. The best feature is the built-in AI translation; it translates conversations in real-time, and it did an effective job in the demo that RayNeo set up on the convention floor. The glasses are coming out in the latter half of the year, and I can't wait to get my hands on the product.

Foldables phones have become mainstream these days, but that isn't the case with notebooks. Well, Lenovo is aiming to change that with the ThinkBook Flip, a device that has an absurd 18.1-inch panel that folds outwards. Other than the fact that the panel folding outwards means there's always a section that's prone to damage should it take a tumble, I don't really see how the extra-tall width makes sense on a notebook. This is just a demo at this point, and it's unlikely Lenovo will introduce a consumer model anytime soon.

Etisalat is the UAE's biggest carrier, and it now goes by the name e&. Anyway, it had a humanoid robot at its booth made by the U.K.'s Engineering Arts, and it was pretty convincing. Called Amira, the robot mimics facial cues easily, and it uses AI to converse. Engineering Arts noted that the robot on the show floor was controlled by a human to answer queries — we were told that is the only reliable way to make any sense of dozens of attendings shouting questions at once — so we don't have to be too worried about the robot apocalypse.

In the past four decades, the gap between rich and poor has grown significantly. It’s a dangerous trend.
by  Abdallah Fayyad
A Vox reader asks: What is wealth inequality and class warfare and why is it extra bad at this point in time?
“Wealth” is someone’s net worth — that is, their assets (like savings, stock portfolios, and the value of their property) minus their debts (like student loans). “Wealth inequality” is measured by looking at how total wealth is spread out across the population. The more wealth there is at the top, the more inequality there is because there’s less to go around for everyone else.
The Explain It to Me newsletter answers an interesting question from an audience member in a digestible explainer from one of our journalists.
Today, there’s a huge gap in incomes between rich and poor. Even though incomes across the board rose at relatively similar rates in the decades after World War Two, incomes at the very top started to grow much faster after the 1970s — a trend that’s driven, at least in part, by shrinking union membership. For instance, CEOs’ compensation has grown by 1,085 percent since 1978 while the average worker’s salary has only grown by 24 percent. 
And though wages at the bottom have grown at a faster clip than those at the top in recent years, that change has not been enough to reverse the overall trend. Since 1979, the top 1 percent of earners saw their wages grow by 182 percent; the bottom 90 percent saw their wages grow by 44 percent. As a result, the concentration of money at the top of the income ladder is at the highest it’s been in nearly 100 years. 
But that’s income inequality, which just looks at the distribution of people’s wages. What’s more extreme is the gap in wealth between rich and poor households. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the bottom half of households have an average net worth of $51,000. Collectively, they own just 2.5 percent of household wealth in the country. By contrast, the top 10 percent of households had an average net worth of nearly $7 million and own more than two-thirds of household wealth — a share that has only been growing over the last three decades. 
There are other worrying aspects of the wealth gap, including racial inequality. On average, for every $1 that white families owned, Black families and Latino families owned 23 cents and 19 cents, respectively.
Class warfare, or class conflict, happens when the tension between social classes comes to a boil. That happens when the interests of different classes diverge, building resentment between them. Oftentimes, this comes in the form of protest or revolt and is generally viewed as a struggle between workers and the ruling class or elites in society. Sometimes this gets violent, as was the case in the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, when workers in multiple states went on strike after railroad workers saw their wages get repeatedly cut. Eventually the rebellion was squashed by the National Guard and private militias, and about 100 people were killed.
Part of the reason you might be hearing phrases like “wealth inequality” or “class warfare” more often these days is because the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of the few has been on full display. In January, for example, Donald Trump, a billionaire, was sworn in as president while being surrounded by other billionaires. (There were many, many millionaires in the audience as well.) So as most Americans who watched Trump’s inaugural address saw it on their screens, a handful of the world’s richest men had a front-row seat. In fact, the combined wealth of everyone at the Capitol that day topped $1.2 trillion.
At its very core, the reason this level of inequality is bad is because it’s deeply unfair. But it’s not just a matter of fairness. It’s also dangerous. The fact that so few people own so much wealth is a threat to democracy.
In his farewell address, former President Joe Biden warned the nation that the United States was becoming an oligarchy — a system of government in which power is only shared by a small group of elites. It’s a warning that politicians like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders have been talking about for years, especially after the 2010 Supreme Court decision Citizens United allowed corporations to spend unlimited amounts of money on elections.
The hoarding of wealth is already having an impact on our government. Since Trump returned to the White House, he’s handed over a lot of power to Elon Musk, who, with a net worth of hundreds of billions of dollars, stands to be the world’s richest man. And while Musk is charged with gutting the federal workforce, he’s not required to adhere to certain government standards. 
Why is it that Musk has been able to evade the ethics rules that typically apply to other government personnel? And why is it, anyway, that Musk — now an unelected bureaucrat — has so much influence over policymaking? The answer is that Musk likely gained access to so much power because he spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the election last year in an attempt to help Republicans win, and his investment seems to have paid off. He operates by different rules than everyone else because he can simply buy his way to the White House.
The concentration of wealth has also degraded some of the country’s institutions outside of government. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, for example, who owns the Washington Post, directed the newspaper’s opinion pages to avoid publishing views that are in conflict with his own, focusing their coverage on “personal liberties and free markets.” Bezos also killed the Post’s endorsement of Kamala Harris last fall.
It’s not necessarily the case, though, that America is on the brink of a class war, despite the fact that there’s so much inequality that billionaires are taking joyrides to space while millions of Americans are struggling to make ends meet. In fact, the last election cycle showed that people in different income brackets are becoming less politically divided, with Trump making gains among poorer voters, who historically have overwhelmingly voted for Democrats. 
But if history is any guide, this level of inequality is unsustainable, and the economy might course-correct. Between 1800 and 1920, for example, inequality in the US grew very quickly. But in the 60 years that followed, the gap between rich and poor shrank significantly. During that period, the wealth of the average family grew 40 times its size while the wealthiest Americans saw their fortunes double.
It’s hard to say how the situation will improve this time. But chances are, at some point, that the rich will push their luck and the rest will say enough.

AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data to identify emerging trends, predict consumer demand, and anticipate market changes long before they become mainstream.
If you, like millions of others decided to do a “dry January” in past years you might have noticed that your options were limited to sugary soda or just water.
Thankfully those days are over as the alcohol-free movement has exploded, offering a wide array of beverages that mimic the taste and experience of their alcoholic counterparts, but have the best bonus to offer – they don’t effect your body the same way alcohol does.
Consumers, mostly Millennials and Gen Z, are increasingly prioritizing health and wellness. They’re more aware of the negative impacts of alcohol, seeking alternatives that align with their fitness goals and overall well-being. For example, in the US, the alcohol-free market, revenue is predicted to grow annually by 2.70% (CAGR 2025-2029).
This trend presents an opportunity rather than a threat to traditional liquor companies, and leading brands are already capitalizing on this trend by offering alcohol-free versions of their renowned beverages, which attract a new demographic and elevate their sales.
However, what are the challenges associated with aligning with these trends?
Let's consider the example of introducing a new alcohol-free drink to the market. The first step involves identifying and understanding the target audience. This includes analyzing the demographic's lifestyle choices and prevailing trends within this group.
Subsequently, product design is initiated, encompassing aspects such as taste and packaging, before moving into production.
Often, the same equipment is used for both alcohol and alcohol-free versions of beverages, which increases the pressure on machinery. This necessitates meticulous scheduling and maintenance, making effective asset management crucial. It is essential to anticipate potential breakdowns or disruptions well in advance to prevent them from impacting production.
Finally, once the product is ready, the focus shifts to branding, market entry, and positioning it effectively to the target audience.
These steps are inherently time-consuming and demand not only effective collaboration across various departments but also the strategic deployment of appropriate technologies.
To streamline operations, businesses can harness the power of machine learning and automation, thereby eliminating manual processes. AI-driven systems function as intelligent assistants, continuously refining workflows, predicting potential disruptions, and executing tasks with greater speed and accuracy compared to human intervention alone:.
New trends such as alcohol free beverages can emerge at any moment, but they should not pose a threat to your business. Instead, with the right technologies in place, you can capitalize on these changes and leverage them as opportunities for growth. Any business that embraces change needs to integrate AI, automation, and intelligent decision-making into its daily operations, ensuring it stays ahead of emerging trends and drives success with agility and efficiency.
The question remains: Are you prepared to unlock your full potential?

Broadcom reported strong earnings and issued an upbeat forecast. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty ... [+] Images)
Key Takeaways
Stocks continued to be volatile on Thursday with the S&P 500 dropping 1.8%. Ten of the 11 sectors in the S&P were lower with energy being the one exception, gaining 0.5%. The Nasdaq Composite fared even worse, dropping 2.6% while the Russell 2000 and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.5% and 1%, respectively. The weakness we're seeing is widespread with the U.S. dollar also falling, closing at its lowest level since the election, capping off its worst four day stretch since 2022, according to The Wall Street Journal. We'll see how the market ultimately digests today's latest jobs report.
The enthusiasm over artificial intelligence that propelled much of the gains last year has been overshadowed by on again off again tariffs that the market is struggling to price in. AI stocks have been hit hard and some of Thursday’s worst performing stocks were AI-related. Palantir fell 11% and Marvell Technology dropped 20%. The Magnificent Seven, many of which have ties to AI, are down 10% on the year in aggregate. There was, however, some good news in AI Friday morning as Broadcom reported earnings that beat forecasts, and the company also issued an upbeat outlook. Shares of Broadcom are higher by 11% in premarket.
Whether you are pro- or anti-tariff, the market doesn’t like uncertainty and that is what is happening. Therefore, until we have a definitive policy, the choppy trading we’re seeing may continue. More and more companies are citing tariffs as a concern when reporting earnings as well. Costco, which reported Thursday, warned of tighter profit margins and a cautious consumer moving forward. That stock is down 2% premarket. Hewlett Packard Enterprises also cited tariffs and the effect on lower profit margins moving forward, sending that stock down 20% premarket.
One stock that reported good results was Gap Inc. That company beat on the top and bottom lines as new CEO Richard Dickson has helped turned the company around. I’ve always been fascinated by this company because it’s been on the ropes more than a few times but always seems to come back. The last stock I want to mention is Walgreens. While the company did not report earnings, Walgreens did announce Sycamore Partners will take it private in a deal valued at $10 billion. As recently as 2015, the company was valued at $106 billion.
Turning back to the major indices for a moment, I want to call out the 200-day moving average (DMA) in the S&P 500. Daily moving averages are watched by countless traders and the longer the duration of the average, the more important it may become. The S&P has touched its 200 DMA for three consecutive days. This is a lot like a massive bear jumping on a trampoline. Eventually, the trampoline tends to break. Therefore, this has me a bit concerned, especially when placed in the context of market uncertainty.
For today, I want to see how the market takes the jobs report. According to Bloomberg, forecasts were for 159,000 new jobs and an unemployment rate of 4%. The actual report showed 151,000 jobs and an unemployment rate of 4.1%. Markets have initially rallied on the news, but I think the immediate concern is uncertainty over tariffs. I would not be surprised if we saw a deleveraging as we head into the weekend. Volatility is still quite high with the VIX at 25, therefore, continued choppy trading could continue. I’ll also be watching the S&P 500's 200 DMA. A break below 5,730 could mean more selling pressure. As always, I would stick with your investing plans and long-term objectives.

84,2025-03-07,"Walgreens, once a cornerstone of American retail, has faced a dramatic fall from grace.
Earlier this week, the pharmacy giant was sold to private-equity firm Sycamore Partners for just $10 billion –  a staggering decline from its nearly $100 billion valuation in 2015. The deal marks the culmination of a decade-long struggle for the Chicago-based chain, taking it off of the stock market after just shy of 100 years.
“Meaningful value creation will take time, focus, and change that is better managed as a private company,” said CEO Tim Wentworth, pointing to Sycamore’s track record of retail turnarounds as a potential lifeline. 
Walgreens’ woes are extensive. As as consumers increasingly turned to  e-commerce giants like Amazon for everyday essentials, Walgreens struggled to keep pace. Meanwhile, rivals like CVS merged with health insurers, gaining  control of the lucrative reimbursement market. Caught on a tightrope, Walgreens failed to find its balance. In Oct. 2024, the company announced plans to close 1,200 stores in an effort to stem its financial losses. 
The company’s difficulties were worsened by a series of costly missteps in tech and healthcare. Walgreens invested $140 million in Theranos, a blood-testing startup that promised to revolutionize diagnostics. The partnership aimed to place Theranos clinics in Walgreens stores, but the deal fell apart after the startup’s devices were found to misdiagnose patients, leading to its collapse. 
Further complicating the company’s strategy, Walgreens poured $6.2 billion into VillageMD, a network of primary-care clinics, under the leadership of former CEO Rosalind Brewer, previously a Starbucks (SBUX+0.83%), Sam’s Club (WMT+1.10%), and Walmart executive. Walgreens burned through more cash when it spent $9 billion to acquire urgent-care centers, including CityMD, in 2022. These moves only deepened the company’s debt without addressing core challenges in its pharmacy business.  
Tech innovations also turned into costly headaches. In a high-profile failure, Walgreens spent $200 million attempting  to modernize stores by replacing traditional refrigerator doors with digital screens. The experiment flopped, signaling a broader failure to innovate effectively. As cash flow lagged, debt mounted, and shares plummeted, the company’s future grew increasingly uncertain. 
In January, Walgreens suspended its 91-year-old quarterly dividend to conserve cash amid rising debt and legal troubles. That same month, the U.S. Justice Department sued the company over millions of questionable opioid prescriptions. In Sept. 2024, Walgreens agreed to pay $106 million to settle false payment claims. 
Enter Sycamore Partners, a private-equity firm based in New York that’s known for its work with retail and consumer brands such as Loft and Ann Taylor. Sycamore is expected to either sell off parts of Walgreens, including its Boots pharmacies in the U.K., or work with partners to revive the business. The deal could help refocus Walgreens’ core U.S. retail pharmacy operations while shedding less-profitable assets. 
The downfall of Walgreens is emblematic of the challenges facing the U.S. healthcare sector. As competition from Amazon, Walmart, and CVS (CVS+0.43%) intensifies, even once-dominant pharmacy chains are struggling to stay relevant. The days when Walgreens ruled the wallets of American consumers are long gone.

The stock market has entered the danger zone as the Samp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 hover near their 200-day moving averages.

        Both indexes are trading at the key technical support level after a 6% decline in the S&P 500 and a 9% sell-off in the Nasdaq 100 since mid-February.
    

        The 200-day moving average is a closely watched technical indicator that helps identify the long-term direction of a trend.
    

        When securities fall below their 200-day moving average, it sends a warning to traders that the prior uptrend in price could be on the verge of reversing course and establishing a downtrend.
    

        The Nasdaq 100 closed below its 200-day moving average on Thursday for the first time since March 2023, while the S&P 500 tested the level multiple times this week for the first time since October 2023.
    

        As of Friday morning, the S&P 500 is trading at 5,728.90, just a few points below its 200-day moving average of 5,732, while the Nasdaq 100 is trading at 20,056.35, below its 200-day moving average of 20,246.83.
    

        It's a potentially make-or-break moment for the stock market as traders assess the impact of President Donald Trump's tariff policies.
    

        According to technical analyst Katie Stockton of Fairlead Strategies, the S&P 500 needs to stage a decisive bounce above this technical level to prevent further downside.
    

        ""Our short-term indicators suggest it will act as a staging ground for a brief oversold bounce,"" Stockton told clients in a note on Friday. ""Nevertheless, a close below 5,783 today would leave a breakdown pending confirmation next Friday.""
    

        Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group, told Business Insider that he wouldn't be surprised if big-money buyers started to enter the market.
    

        ""These longer-term trendlines can be used by institutions to buy up shares, so we'd expect to see some type of potential buying down around here,"" Detrick said, adding that this correction in the stock market is perfectly normal, especially after the back-to-back years of 20%+ gains in 2023 and 2024.
    

        ""We remain overweight equities and would use it as an opportunity to accumulate solid companies at a discount. After gaining 20% two years in a row, some consolidation early this year makes a lot of sense,"" Detrick said.
    

        Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, highlighted in a note this week that an index that equally weights the Magnificent Seven mega-cap tech stocks — Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla — is also trading at its 200-day moving average.
    

        If it falls below the threshold, it would suggest investors should look elsewhere for leadership in the stock market.
    

        ""A violation of the 200-dma would imply that the Mag Seven's leadership status has been revoked,"" Turnquist said.
    

        For David Keller, chief strategist at Sierra Alpha Research, traders should be on watch for a more painful decline in stock prices.
    

        Keller told BI that a confirmed breakdown below the 5,700 level in the S&P 500 would suggest that the index could test support at 5,500, representing potential downside of about 4% from current levels.

If Nnedinma Obiwuru is going to rent, she's going to do it in style.

        Obiwuru, a 31-year-old marketing specialist, and her partner have spent $7,000 transforming their rental apartment in Austin into a Parisian-inspired sanctuary. Her goal: Take the $3,000-a-month, two-bedroom unit from a white box to a chic boutique hotel.
    

        Her inspiration for the primary bedroom — with its vintage hand-carved bedframe, a hand-me-down from her fianc's grandmother, and a $130 chandelier from Amazon— was a suite at Paris's famed Relais Christine. Rooms at the 17th-century mansion turned luxury hotel with ornately decorated go for around $650 a night. For the guest room, she handmade red velvet banquette chairs and a DIY bar that can fold up and be stored in a closet when not in use. The projects in the 1,300-square-foot space have taken a total of five years.
    

        ""Our guests always freak out when they visit,"" Obiwuru said. ""Every time they come, there's something new. People usually stay for at least six hours.""
    

        As the US real-estate market remains historically expensive, some young Americans have put off or given up on their dreams of homeownership. Instead, they are redirecting their resources toward renovating their rental properties. They may spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars, along with a lot of time and effort, to make their homes reflect their personal styles.
    

        In Austin, where Obiwuru lives, home prices have dipped but remain well above the US median. The high cost of homeownership has led many residents to opt for long-term renting.
    

        ""Owning a house in Austin feels more like a 10-year dream,"" Obiwuru told Business Insider. ""Renting is where I'm at, and many of my friends are in the same situation. That's why I focus on making my place feel like home.""
    

        Before the renovation, the guest room looked like just another standard room you'd find in an apartment — nothing special, with plain cream walls and a tan carpet.
    

        Now a bar-and-restaurant-themed space, Obiwuru and her fianc, John, built most of the furniture themselves. The red velvet booth seating, made of wood, foam, and fabric, cost $700 to create.
    

        ""It was the first piece of furniture I've ever made,"" she said. ""I wouldn't necessarily recommend it — it was a lot of work. But I really wanted restaurant-style seating, and everything online was over $4,000, and I just couldn't justify spending that much for something to sit on.""
    

        Obiwuru spent just $80 building a collapsible bar made of ""just plywood and hinges. She went to Home Depot, had workers cut the wood to size, then added paneling to the outside and painted it brown herself.
    

        She said she stores the bar in her closet and typically brings it out when she's making drinks and hosting friends.
    

        ""The cool thing is that everything I build and design in the apartment is renter-friendly,"" she said. ""We're thinking we can later move the bar into our living room or kitchen area. It's easy to move and leaves no marks.""
    

        Obiwuru's design style is deeply shaped by her love for travel and the hotels she's visited.
    

        ""I'm a first-generation Nigerian-American,"" Obiwuru said. ""My parents provided everything we needed, but with five siblings, travel wasn't a top priority. When I began exploring the world and staying in hotels, I truly began to feel more like myself.""
    

        She's recently turned to Maison Metier, a five-star hotel in New Orleans where rooms are about $250 a night, as a blueprint for how to layer seemingly eclectic pieces of furniture and art.
    

        Obiwuru said most of the pieces in her home are thrifted from local stores and cost between 49 cents and about $20.
    

        However, she has splurged on a few larger items, like the large brown leather couch in her living room, which cost $1,000 from Wayfair.
    

        The gallery wall in one bathroom wall is also lined with thrifted items.
    

        ""I love it when I go to a bar, and it feels like you're transported somewhere else,"" Obiwuru said. ""Bathrooms, or powder rooms, are where designers can really get creative because they're contained spaces. I knew I wanted to fill mine with frames.""
    

        With a budget of just $100, she and her fianc visited several Goodwill stores in the Austin area, where they found 51 picture frames. To fill them, they sourced Harlem Renaissance and Prohibition-era artwork, spanning from the 1920s to the mid-'30s, both online and around town.
    

        Obiwuru loves her home, and many others do, too.
    

        She told BI that a maintenance worker in her apartment complex remarked, ""This is the best apartment he's ever seen.""
    

        Obiwuru said she doesn't need her landlord's approval for her projects because they leave no permanent damage. Whenever she moves out, she added, she'll leave the apartment as it looked when she moved in.
    

        Still, she would do a few things differently knowing what she knows now. She painted some rooms before she had a complete design plan in place.
    

        ""I didn't have a full vision when I moved in and designed based on the vibe I had at the time,"" she said. ""I've learned to move more slowly.""
    

        She also mentioned that renovating an apartment while living next door to neighbors has its challenges.
    

        ""I'm an early riser, so I want to start my projects at 5 a.m., but that's just not possible,"" Obiwuru said. ""You have to work around regular hours, and that's the tough part about doing loud projects while living close to others.""
    

        During the renovation, she started documenting and sharing parts of the process on Instagram under the username @everylastlayer. She now has more than 38,000 followers, and some of her projects are sponsored by brands.
    

        Still, Obiwuru and her fianc plan to continue renting for the long haul.
    

        ""We can absolutely save for a house, but our priorities are more experiential, at least for now,"" she said. ""We'd rather travel and spend our money on things like day care for our dogs than save for a down payment.""
    

        She added, ""The majority of the people I'm around are renting for the foreseeable future. I think the stigma around it is going away.""

As bird flu continues to impact egg availability and push up prices, you might be wondering which other everyday products could be affected by the recent outbreaks.

        The H5N1 virus, which has affected 166 million birds since 2022 and infected 70 humans, has been detected in poultry, dairy cattle, and mammals like seals and cats.
    

        It can spread through direct contact with contaminated animals, water sources, or surfaces, putting poultry industry workers at greatest risk of infection.
    

        Most recently, a raw chicken cat food recall notice was issued for suspected contamination with the virus.
    

        Experts told Business Insider that most consumer products won't present dangers due to the close inspection required for mass production for consumers, and guidance for farmers — such as culling flocks of birds when an infection is identified — aims to prevent contaminated products from entering the market.
    

        Another factor contributing to safety in the food supply is the processing of dairy products, like milk and cheese, as pasteurization effectively kills viruses and other harmful bacteria.
    

        Here's how to stay safe from the bird flu while grocery shopping.

Looking to History for Clues of a New Rally
Uncertainty about the state of the U.S. and global economy, corporate profitability and spending of AI, as well as the forward path of inflation and U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cuts led to a decline in the U.S. stock market. Currently, as of March 6 intraday, the S&P 500 is down -2.3%, the Nasdaq Composite is down –6.4% and the small cap Russell 2000 is down –7.3% for the year. The S&P 500 is testing its 200-DMA and looks increasingly likely to breach that level. As a result, we think it is a good time to re-circulate our study on U.S. market corrections and what to look for going forward.
The O’Neil Methodology believes that equity markets transition from a downtrend to an uptrend on a rally starting with what we term a Follow-Through Day (FTD). An FTD is a gain of 1.7% or more on volume above the prior day’s session and can occur only after the market has not made a new low for three days. Days 4–7 are typically the strongest FTDs.
There are two basic cases for corrections.
We would note that our study is based on a starting point where the S&P 500 is coming from a well-established bull market, and closes below the 200-DMA and is at least 9% off highs. While we are not there yet, the S&P 500 has dropped 7% from highs currently, and it is possible it does not reach the 9% threshold. However, if it does breach the 200 DMA and falls over 9%, the statistics below become especially relevant.
On the S&P 500, there have been 35 corrections of at least 9% and a move below the 200-DMA since 1970. Of these:
Scenario 1 - Bull Case #1: Nineteen Bull Market Corrections in which the First Follow-Through Day led to new Highs
 
The keys in this scenario include:
 
 
Scenario 2 - Bull Case #2: Eight Bull Market Corrections with Undercut of Lows after First Follow-Through Day, but Successful Second Follow-Through Day

 
The keys in this scenario include:

 
 
Scenario 3 - Bear Case (Eight Corrections which led to Bear Markets)
 
The keys in this scenario include:
 
Post FTDs, some distribution is normal. For the three scenarios, here are the historical distribution days within the first four weeks.
 
In Conclusion 
While the forward path of the market is uncertain, we believe there is a high probability that the S&P 500 will break its 200 DMA. In that case, we will be looking for an FTD to occur. How this FTD occurs and what action the market takes immediately after it will determine our level of confidence in a new bull market emerging. To reiterate, often the first FTD fails but the second is successful and leads to a strong rally. If this does not happen, an extended bear market may arrive. For now, we suggest investors proceed with caution until positive O’Neil Methodology technical signals occur. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both made a new intraday low on Friday. If they close in the upper half of the daily range, (considered day one off lows), and do not make another new low, then an FTD could occur as early as next Wednesday (day four). If they do not close in the upper half of the range, but also do not make another new low, the FTD could occur as early as next Thursday.

89,2025-03-07,"This week, Apple introduced three new products: a fresh MacBook Air, iPad Air, and iPad. One thing each of these devices has in common is that they basically look the same as the models they are replacing—except for one tiny detail on the new MacBook.
As iCulture’s noted first, the new laptop addresses a design flaw that Apple has had for the past 26 years. Since the launch of the PowerBook G3 ‘Lombard’ in 1999, the mute key on every Apple laptop has featured a speaker icon. However, this design does not clearly indicate that the button can both mute and unmute the computer’s audio. With the introduction of the new MacBook Air, the keyboard now displays a speaker icon with a strike-through, clearly signaling its full function. For those keeping score at home, the button in question is the F10 key.
The 2025 MacBook Air has introduced several notable updates, focusing mainly on performance. A key highlight is the addition of the new M4 chip, which enhances processing power and efficiency.
Apple continues to offer the popular 13-inch and 15-inch screen size options, catering to various user preferences for portability and display size. A new “Sky Blue” color has been added to the lineup, providing an additional aesthetic choice alongside the familiar Midnight, Starlight, and Silver finishes.
Furthermore, Apple has upgraded the built-in webcam to a 12MP Center Stage camera, which improves video call quality.
Apple has lowered the starting price for the 13-inch model to $999, down from $1,099 for the previous generation.
We’re unsure why the mute key icon was changed 26 years ago, and we are equally puzzled about why Apple has finally decided to change it back. Apple’s attention to detail on certain products is always impressive, even if it takes over a quarter of a century to come to light. Regardless, this is a fun little story!
The new Apple products are available to pre-order now. They all go on the market on Wednesday, March 12.
With the introduction of the new M4 MacBook Air, it's time to say goodbye to some of the older models. This time, both the M3 and the M2 MacBook Air will disappear from Apple Store shelves. Unlike the M3, however, the M2 isn't being discontinued completely -- it will still be available at certain retailers.
This gives people a chance to get an amazing laptop (the laptop I'm writing on right now) at a really good price. TechRadar has already spotted certain M2 MacBook Air configurations on Amazon selling for as low as $699. That's 30% off MSRP and 30% less than the new M4 model.
Apple has just launched a new MacBook Air equipped with its M4 chip, bringing improved performance and efficiency to one of the company’s best MacBooks. The long-rumored update means that all of Apple’s laptops now come with the M4 chip.
As expected, the M4 MacBook Air is more of an evolution than a revolution. The M4 chip means a slight improvement in terms of performance compared to the previous M3 version, but there are few changes elsewhere. According to Apple, the M4 MacBook Air can perform tasks like video editing and photo editing up to 2x faster than its M1 counterpart -- so upgrading could be worth it for M1 owners.
Apple CEO Tim Cook just posted a teaser to X with the caption ""This week."" and a six-second video showing the words ""There's something in the AIR."" We've been expecting the M4 MacBook Air announcement for a couple of weeks now, and with the iPhone 16e reveal out of the way, it looks like this is the week.

90,2025-03-07,"If you’re waiting for a chance to upgrade your gaming rig, you don’t have to wait much longer. AMD announced that the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and the Ryzen 9 9900X3D will hit store shelves on March 12 for $699 and $599, respectively. First unveiled at CES 2025, these two processors promise huge gains in performance for gamers wanting the best frame rates and visuals they can possibly get.
AMD describes the Ryzen 9 9950X3D as the “ultimate 16-core desktop CPU,” and while there might be a bit of hyperbole involved, this is an undeniably powerful piece of hardware. Its 16 cores give it 32 Threads, and it comes with a base clock speed of 4.3GHz that can boost up to 5.7GHz. It also sports a 144MB cache and uses an admittedly high 170W TDP.
The world&#39;s best processor for gaming and content creation is almost here.  ​
Available starting March 12th​Ryzen 9 9950X3D – $699​Ryzen 9 9900X3D – $599​
A huge thank you to our incredible community of gamers, creators, and innovators for your continued support.  Together,… pic.twitter.com/ino6ZNMvi6
&mdash; Jack Huynh (@JackMHuynh) March 7, 2025
The Ryzen 9 9900X3D is slightly less powerful, but still nothing to scoff at. With 12 cores and 24 Threads, this CPU is more than capable of handling most anything you throw at it, but make no mistake: it’s designed with gaming in mind. With a base clock speed of 4.4 GHz and a max speed of 5.5GHz, you’ll get great performance with a more reasonable 120W TDP.
If the prices feel familiar, it’s because AMD hasn’t changed a thing from the last-generation equivalents of these two cards. It’s still on the higher-end compared to other cards on the market, but these offer an alternative to the hard-to-find 9800X3D. Opting for a non-X3D card will save money, but comes with a significant gaming performance hit.
If either of these processors sounds like the missing link in your ideal gaming rig, keep your eyes peeled: they’ll be available for purchase in less than a week.
At this point, AMD has been on top when we're talking about the best processors for gaming, but it still took CES 2025 to do a victory lap and extend its lead. Opening up the keynote address, AMD revealed the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D, both of which will be available in the first quarter of this year.
The performance here doesn't sway things much, as AMD has already claimed the top slot for gaming processors with its wildly popular Ryzen 7 9800X3D. As you can see below, however, AMD claims an 8% lead over last-gen's Ryzen 9 7950X3D on average after testing 40 games. Unsurprisingly, graphically intensive games like Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and Black Myth: Wukong see little benefit, but AMD is claiming a lead as large as 58% in a game like Counter-Strike 2. 
AMD just announced over a dozen new laptop CPUs, which will appear in over 150 new laptops being announced at CES 2025 and later this year, including a new 3D V-Cache chip for gaming laptops and some really impressive graphics in its new Ryzen AI Max+ halo chips.
Let's start with Fire Range. These chips are for high-end gaming laptops, a successor to Dragon Range line, catering to enthusiast gamers and, so far, only enthusiasts are going to be happy, as those laptops likely be quite expensive. On the other hand, the CPUs sound mighty powerful. The lineup includes, first and foremost, the next big 3D V-Cache chip, dubbed the Ryzen 9 9955HX3D.
The first gaming handheld to feature one of AMD's best processors is finally here, but it's going to be a tough sell. The OneXFly F1 Pro comes with a host of impressive features, from an OLED screen to the powerful Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 APU. It could undoubtedly beat the Steam Deck and various other rivals. The downside? You might as well just buy a gaming laptop, and a good one, too -- because this one's pretty expensive.
The OneXFly F1 Pro (first spotted by VideoCardz) is a brand-new gaming handheld made by OneXPlayer, a Chinese company. The mini PC comes with all the bells and whistles you could wish for in a new handheld. There's a 7-inch 1080p OLED screen with a 144Hz refresh rate; LPDDR5X RAM with speeds of up to 7,500MHz; and up to 4TB of PCIe 4.0 solid-state drive storage.

92,2025-03-07,"Donald Trump’s tariffs plan has caused a lot of confusion with his repeated reversals, carve-outs, and threats to raise them. So, in an interview that aired Friday, Fox Business’s Maria Baritromo asked the president to clear things up.
“Can you give us a sense of whether or not we are going to get clarity for the business community?” Baritromo asked the president, noting that business leaders need predictability for planning purposes. 
Trump’s answer was anything but reassuring.
“Well, I think so. But you know, the tariffs could go up as time goes by, and they may go up, and you know, I don’t know if it’s predictability—” Trump meandered before Baritromo cut him off.
“So that’s not clarity,” Baritromo said. Trump responded by casting doubt on the business leaders and whether they actually want predictability.
“You know I think that they say that. You know it sounds good to say. But, for years, the globalists, the big globalists, have been ripping off the United States, they’ve been taking money away from the United States, and all we’re doing is getting some of it back,” Trump said.

When Trump instituted his tariffs against Canada, Mexico, and China on Tuesday, the stock market plummeted, with leaders in U.S. industries ranging from automobiles to agriculture expressing fears about how they would be affected. On Wednesday, Trump announced a carve-out for U.S. automakers, and on Thursday announced Mexico and Canada would not pay tariffs on products that comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, until April 2.
The real goal of the tariffs against Canada, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt admitted Wednesday, is to decimate the country’s economy to force it to become the U.S. fifty-first state. Such an effort would further cause extreme economic confusion and ruin, and if Trump is serious, this tariff fight won’t end anytime soon. 
Amid a flurry of lawsuits against his administration, Trump is trying to make it a whole lot harder to sue him.
According to a memo sent to agency heads on Thursday, the White House is encouraging the use of a rarely used rule that would force anyone who sues the federal government to pay an upfront fee.
“It is the policy of the United States to demand that parties seeking injunctions against the Federal Government must cover the costs and damages incurred if the Government is ultimately found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained,” the memo obtained by CNN reads.
More than 100 lawsuits have been filed against the president since he took office in January. The cases range from challenging his immigration policies and funding cuts, to disputes against the Department of Government Efficiency’s attack on federal agencies. Many of the cases have been successful early on, and they are all ongoing. 
In the memo, the White House framed the cases as a waste of “substantial resources to fighting frivolous suits instead of defending public safety.”
“Taxpayers are forced not only to cover the costs of their antics when funding and hiring decisions are enjoined, but must needlessly wait for Government policies they voted for,” the memo reads.
The rule the White House is attempting to invoke is rarely used in the courts, and the financial barrier could prevent individuals, organizations, unions, and agencies from taking action against the president. 
It’s unclear exactly who would decide how much the plaintiff would have to pay, but the Justice Department would probably ask judges to set the amount, legal expert Mark Zaid told CNN. 
That means the fee could be as little as $1, and as high as … who knows? It’s yet another sly move from Trump to dodge accountability for his relentless attack on the Constitution.
The president has decided to throw some weight behind one of his closest advisers when it comes to dealing with South Africa.
Despite tariff-induced tumult at home, Donald Trump took the time Friday morning to lambast South Africa for how it treats its farmers, threatening aggressive foreign policy toward the continent’s strongest economy by announcing that the United States would stop all federal funding to the African nation.
“South Africa is being terrible, plus, to long time Farmers in the country,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “They are confiscating their LAND and FARMS, and MUCH WORSE THAN THAT. A bad place to be right now, and we are stopping all Federal Funding. To go a step further, any Farmer (with family!) from South Africa, seeking to flee that country for reasons of safety, will be invited into the United States of America with a rapid pathway to Citizenship. This process will begin immediately!”
The missive came hand in hand with a complaint from Elon Musk, who whined on X mere hours before that South Africa would not allow his international internet project to get off the ground, due to a lack of diversity at the billionaire’s company.
“Starlink is not allowed to operate in South Africa, because I’m not black,” Musk posted on X Friday morning.
But that wasn’t exactly an accurate reflection of why Musk’s home country has refused to approve SpaceX’s Starlink service.
The South African government’s Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment policy stipulates that all companies that do business in the nation must have at least 30 percent of their ownership or economic involvement owned by Black South Africans.
The mandate is a part of the country’s efforts to correct inequalities left in the wake of apartheid, striving to “advance economic transformation and enhance the economic participation of black people in the South African economy,” per the South African Department of Trade, Industry, and Competition. 
Musk has practically made the notion of diversity his enemy as he works—via the Department of Government Efficiency—to strip and defund federal agencies whose missions make mention of inclusivity efforts.
“DEI is just another word for racism,” Musk wrote in January. “Shame on anyone who uses it.”
The world’s richest man’s affinity for Nazi salutes have also called into question his racial ideology, especially as a descendant of Nazi sympathizers. That is according to his father, Errol Musk, who told the Podcast and Chill Network in November that the billionaire’s maternal grandparents supported Adolf Hitler and were members of the German Nazi Party in Canada before moving to South Africa in support of apartheid.
Pete Hegseth’s Department of Defense has marked an image of the USAAF B29 bomber that dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima for deletion—and its reason may be the perfect illustration of why right now really isn’t a good time to be closing the Department of Education.
That historical image was among 26,000 that were marked for deletion as part of the  DOD’s rushed efforts to weed out any traces of so-called diversity, equity, and inclusion by Wednesday, according to the Associated Press. The photograph was marked for removal because it prominently features the name of the aircraft: Enola Gay, named for the pilot Colonel Paul Tibbetts’s mother. 
The Associated Press published a database Thursday of thousands of images marked for deletion. While some of the photographs were still visible Thursday, it’s not clear if they will remain so. One official told the AP that close to 100,000 files could be deleted as part of the Pentagon’s latest purge. 
It’s not surprising that the sweep for DEI has consequently targeted the records and achievements of women and minorities in the military, removing mentions of Women’s History Month and Black History Month. One collection of images titled “Women’s History Month: All-female crew supports warfighters” saw its main page removed, though one photograph of an all-female C-17 crew remained. Another photograph titled “Engineering pioneer remembered during Black History Month” was deleted, as well. 
Other photographs swept up in the purge included those of service members with the last name Gay, war heroes such as Marine Corps World War II Medal of Honor recipient Private First Class Harold Gonsalves, and a photograph of a group of Army Corps biologists, who appeared to have earned their spot on the chopping block because they were collecting data about fish including, among other things, their gender.
Online, people weren’t at all impressed by the Pentagon’s thoughtless CTRL-F style of searching for woke.
Former Pentagon spokesperson Chris Meagher called the report “bonkers” in a post on X Thursday. 
Rick Pearson, a political reporter for the Chicago Tribune, called the Pentagon’s purge “complete lunacy and literally an attempt to whitewash history” in a post on X.
“Republicans spent years complaining about cancel culture and then took office and banned photos of the Enola Gay because it has the word gay in it,” posted Skyler Johnson, a candidate for New York State Senate. 
“These fuckers are bigots and fucking idiots too,” wrote Army veteran Fred Wellman, who hosts the podcast On Democracy. 
“What a piece of shit you are @SecDef,” he added in a second post. 
The president’s ruthless back-and-forth on enforcing sweeping tariffs against Canada and Mexico is starting to frustrate his MAGA allies.
Last month, Trump announced he would impose a 25 percent tariff on goods from America’s closest neighbors. Two days later, he backtracked, giving Canada and Mexico a one-month delay. On March 4, the tariffs went into effect, sparking retaliatory tariffs from Canada, as well as outcry from America’s Big Three automakers. 
Two days later, Trump directed another one-month pause for goods that met his 2020 trade deal, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which a White House official told CNBC covered roughly 50 percent of Mexican imports and 38 percent of Canadian imports. And then, in an interview that aired Friday, Trump said the tariffs could go higher than 25 percent.
As a result, the last week saw drastic market fluctuations, with the stock market tumbling as the tariffs went into effect. The Dow dropped 670 points, and by the end of the week, Republican lawmakers were fed up.
“Almost every industry in Kentucky has come to me and said, ‘It will hurt our industry and push up prices of homes, cars,’ and so, I’m gonna continue to argue against tariffs,” Senator Rand Paul told CNN on Thursday.
Senator Thom Tillis agreed that the administration should back off the tariffs if they were hurting constituents.
“When we start losing, you back off. There’s such a thing as strategic retreat,” Tillis told the network. “At the end of the day, I think we have more leverage than any other nation. But we gotta be smart. And we don’t have all the leverage.”
Louisiana Senator John Kennedy told Fox Business he was “worried” about the tariffs, adding that the president should “recalibrate” if the levies start to cause inflation—while insisting that he’s not doubting Trump’s leadership.
“I’m not saying that tariffs are going to cause inflation. President Trump did them in his first term and they didn’t,” Kennedy said. “I’m saying that we just don’t know. We’re in very obscure territory. We’re in uncharted waters. I think if the tariffs do start to cause inflation, I think the president will back away from them.”
Among other tariff proposals, Trump has enforced a 10 percent tariff hike on Chinese goods. That momentarily caused a panic in February for online retailers as the postal service placed a ban on Chinese packages, which it lifted days later. Casting China as a “bulwark of stability” against a backdrop of Trump-induced chaos, the Asian nation’s top diplomat Wang Yi said that China would “definitely, resolutely counter” America’s tariffs.
Donald Trump’s attempt to take over the National Labor Relations Board hit a snag from a federal judge Thursday.
Trump’s firing of Democratic board member Gwynne A. Wilcox was ruled unlawful by U.S. District Court Judge Beryl A. Howell, who ordered Wilcox’s immediate reinstatement and for her to serve out the remainder of her five-year term on the board, which began on September 6, 2023.
In her ruling, Howell wrote that the Constitution “made clear that no one in our system of government was meant to be king—the President included—and not just in name only.
“The President does not have the authority to terminate members of the National Labor Relations Board at will, and his attempt to fire plaintiff from her position on the Board was a blatant violation of the law,” Howell said.
“A president who touts an image of himself as a ‘king’ or a ‘dictator,’ perhaps as his vision of effective leadership, fundamentally misapprehends the role under Article II of the U.S. Constitution,” Howell added.
Wilcox filed the lawsuit last month after Trump fired her and the board’s general counsel, Jennifer Abruzzo, a fellow Biden appointee, leaving the board unable to function without a quorum. In a speech after the hearing Thursday, Wilcox said, “I’m ready to get back to work.”
“It’s not just about me, but I’m glad to be the face of this fight,” Wilcox said.
Trump, Elon Musk, and the rest of the right have long targeted the NLRB, and are in fact trying to get the Supreme Court to declare it unconstitutional and dismantle it with backing from corporations including Amazon, Starbucks, and Trader Joe’s. For now, at least, the NLRB is still around, with long legal fights ahead to save it as well as Wilcox’s position. 
Just hours after he rolled back tariffs on Mexico, the president announced Canada will also not pay tariffs on any products that comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, until April 2. It’s Trump’s third flip on tariffs in 72 hours.
He signed an executive order Thursday solidifying the one-month tariff delay on products from both countries.
On Tuesday, Trump implemented 25 percent tariffs on Mexico and Canada, a disastrous move that plummeted financial markets and prompted retaliatory actions from both U.S. trading partners.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau responded aggressively, immediately implementing retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods and condemning Trump’s betrayal of a longtime ally.
“Every country is very aware that if the American government is willing to do this to their own closest ally, neighbor, and friend, everyone is vulnerable to a trade war,” Trudeau said in a press conference on Tuesday, bypassing Trump and instead speaking directly to the American people.
“Your government has chosen to put American jobs at risk at the thousands of workplaces that succeed because of materials from Canada, or because of consumers in Canada, or both.”
Trump reacted to Trudeau’s address with hostility, and yet again suggested all of Canada’s problems could be solved by becoming the fifty-first American state. His dislike for Trudeau seemingly influenced his decision-making Thursday morning, when he initially retracted tariffs only on Mexico “out of respect” for Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, but not for Canada. Trump on Wednesday also granted a one-month exemption to U.S. automobile companies.
Unsurprisingly, the president has changed his mind yet again, drawing out a trade war that will have disastrous economic consequences. 
Notorious Medicare thief and Republican Senator Rick Scott is the only one who wants to admit that his GOP colleagues are plotting to gut an essential health care program. 
During an appearance at the Rescuing the American Dream Summit in Washington Thursday, Scott said it was only a matter of time before the government would have to cut spending to “any program you care about.”
“Because Medicare is going bankrupt, Social Security is going bankrupt. You know, inflation can’t go away, interest rates can’t come down. So, my belief is that … we’re gonna have to do this,” the Florida Republican said. 
Scott knows a thing or two about bankrupting Medicare. He served as CEO of Columbia/HCA Hospital, which was fined a total of $1.7 billion in 2003 for filing false Medicare claims. At the time, it was the largest health care fraud in history, and while that particular honor has since been passed to another, Scott’s honor remains unrestored. 
Scott is one of the few Republicans who doesn’t seem to be in denial about what having approved the latest budget bill to power Donald Trump’s agenda really means. The bill requires the Committee on Energy and Commerce, which oversees Medicaid, to reduce the deficit by at least $880 billion from 2025 to 2034. Mathematically speaking, cuts that big can only come out of massive programs such as Medicaid.
Cutting the incredibly popular program will undoubtedly prove, well, unpopular, but some Republicans have another strategy: Deny, deny, deny. 
Republican Representative Brandon Gill tiptoed around the issue during an interview on Fox Business Thursday, driving host Maria Bartiromo up the wall. 
“Congressman, I mean, with all due respect, you haven’t given me one offset,” Bartiromo pressed. “OK? You say that you’re not gonna have one problem finding an offset, and so far all I’ve heard you talk about is Elon Musk’s fraud, waste, and abuse cuts, as well as eliminating climate change rules. Again, 76 percent of the money is going to mandatory spending. You know that better than anyone! I’ve got the numbers in front of me. You’ve got $36 trillion in debt.
“Isn’t it time to start looking at the mandatory spending, and trying to figure out how you’re actually gonna cut—I mean, I know nobody wants to say this, but you’ve got stuff like Medicaid, don’t you?” Bartiromo asked. 
Gill insisted he had described areas that could be cut, but noted that, “I agree with you, we are going to have to find some rationalizations.”
Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency used the U.S. Marshals to physically take over a government agency Thursday, and now that agency head is suing. 
Five employees of DOGE along with deputy acting head of the U.S. Agency for International Aid, Peter Marocco, tried to enter the U.S. African Development Foundation headquarters on Wednesday, but were prevented from getting into the building by security and were forced to leave. 
USADF staff told a security guard to deny access to the DOGE team and Marocco, who illegally entered the Capitol during the January 6 insurrection, and whom Trump is trying to install as the agency’s new chief. The agency’s employees cited a letter from the USADF’s current chair, Ward Brehm, which stated, “In my absence, I have specifically instructed the staff of USADF to adhere to our rules and procedure of not allowing any meetings of this type without my presence. 
“I will look forward to working with Mr. Marocco after such time that he is nominated for a seat on the Board and his nomination is confirmed by the Senate,” Brehm wrote in the letter. “Until these legal requirements are met, Mr. Marocco does not hold any position or office with USADF, and he may not speak or act on the Foundation’s behalf.”
On Thursday, Marocco and DOGE staffers returned to the agency—this time, with the U.S. Marshals. They were able to enter the building, which had no staff present, according to a government source.
Hours later, Brehm filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court against Marocco and DOGE, which detailed how the group initially threatened to sue the security guard barring them access, and told the building’s property manager that they would bring U.S. Marshals and Secret Service agents if they weren’t allowed into the building.
“Their threats were unsuccessful” that day, the lawsuit states. 
Marocco and DOGE staff were trying to carry out Trump’s February 19 executive order, in which he declared the USADF and three other agencies “unnecessary” and subject to elimination. The agency, created by Congress in 1980, supports small businesses and grassroots organizations helping marginalized people in Africa through grants. From 2019 to 2023, it funded 1,050 community enterprises serving 6.2 million people with $141 million in grants.
“Any attempt to unilaterally dismantle the USADF through executive action violates the law and exceeds the constitutional limits of executive authority,” wrote Democratic members of the House’s Foreign Affairs Committee in a letter to President Trump last month. 
While DOGE eventually forced its way into the agency, its chief was able to file a lawsuit before any agency staff were fired. Will the maneuver protect the agency and force the Trump administration to close it through congressional action, or is USADF only delaying the inevitable? 
California Governor Gavin Newsom shattered his reputation as an advocate for LGBTQ rights and betrayed the Democratic Party on Thursday.
In the debut episode of his new podcast, This Is Gavin Newsom, Newsom broke with his own party’s stance on trans rights and suggested that transgender athletes should not be allowed to participate in women’s sports, a spineless move from the Democrat who is likely preparing for a presidential run in 2028.
“I think it’s an issue of fairness, I completely agree with you on that. It is an issue of fairness—it’s deeply unfair,” Gavin said to his guest Charlie Kirk, a MAGA activist known for pushing Trumpism on college campuses through his organization Turning Point USA.
For decades, Newsom has been a strong supporter of LGBTQ rights, and even defied his own party by issuing same-sex marriage licenses as mayor of San Francisco in 2004, more than a decade before same-sex marriage was legal nationwide. Twenty years later, the governor is breaking with his own party yet again, this time in a weak-kneed turn to the right.
Trans athletes participating in women’s sports has long been a point of attack for Donald Trump and MAGA, and a contentious topic of debate between Democrats and Republicans. On February 5, Trump signed an executive order barring trans athletes from competing in women’s sports. The next day, the NCAA said only athletes assigned female at birth could participate in women’s competition, a heartbreaking move for trans women and nonbinary people competing in the NCAA.
In discussion with Kirk, Newsom touched on his background as a college baseball player and a father to four girls. “I revere sports, so the issue of fairness is completely legit,” Newsom said.
He went so far as to applaud the GOP for its demonization of trans people, praising Trump’s ad “Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.”
“I saw that—the last couple years, boy did I [see] how you guys were able to weaponize that issue at another level,” Newsom told Kirk.
Why the governor of California chose a 31-year-old MAGA bigot as his companion in a conversation on the rights of a marginalized community remains to be seen. But, according to the trailer for This Is Gavin Newsom, Kirk is just the first of many MAGA guests Newsom will cozy up to in the coming months.
“It’s time to have conversations with people that agree AND disagree with us,” the podcast’s description reads. “It’s time to answer the hard questions and be open to criticism, and debate, without demeaning or dehumanizing one another.” Unless, of course, those in question are trans people."
93,2025-03-07,"Donald Trump’s efforts to shrink the federal workforce are getting in the way of his own agenda. 
More than 100 employees at the Executive Office of Immigration Review have either been terminated or opted into the government’s deferred resignation program, creating a new roadblock in the Trump administration’s goal to execute massive deportations, according to ABC News. 
For scale, the U.S. employs roughly 735 immigration judges in the country’s 71 immigration courts, charged with handling a backlog of 3.7 million cases—and the number increases every day. 
The Trump administration’s efforts to cull extraneous workers has led to the departure of 43 immigration judges, as well as 85 essential administrative staff.
Matt Biggs, the president of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, told ABC News that the Trump administration’s efforts to dismiss the immigration judges his union represents was “highly hypocritical.”
“How do you deport people without immigration judges?” Biggs said. “It’s highly hypocritical. It runs contrary to what he campaigned on. He’s making it more difficult to deport people from this country. It makes no sense at all.”
Cutting roughly six percent of the U.S. stock of judges certainly won’t prevent the Trump administration’s efforts to enact massive deportations; it will likely just make them even more slow and painful for those subjected to detainment by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which on Thursday officially revived the policy of detaining migrant families with children. The practice had been banned under President Joe Biden.  
It’s also possible that some judges are being dismissed for political reasons. Kerry Doyle, a longtime immigration attorney, was one of 13 in a class of newly hired immigration judges who was dismissed last month. She had previously been flagged on the American Accountability Foundation’s “DHS Bureaucrat Watchlist.” 
The website described Doyle as an “immigration activist lawyer” with a “known history as a critic of DHS” and a “lifelong commitment to open borders and mass migration,” according to Mother Jones. Now, she’s out of a job. 
In a post on LinkedIn, Doyle wrote that her dismissal was “political.”
“The reality is that you’ve got a really broken system, and firing judges is not the way to fix it,” Doyle told ABC News. 
Donald Trump’s tariffs plan has caused a lot of confusion with his repeated reversals, carve-outs, and threats to raise them. So, in an interview that aired Friday, Fox Business’s Maria Baritromo asked the president to clear things up.
“Can you give us a sense of whether or not we are going to get clarity for the business community?” Baritromo asked the president, noting that business leaders need predictability for planning purposes. 
Trump’s answer was anything but reassuring.
“Well, I think so. But you know, the tariffs could go up as time goes by, and they may go up, and you know, I don’t know if it’s predictability—” Trump meandered before Baritromo cut him off.
“So that’s not clarity,” Baritromo said. Trump responded by casting doubt on the business leaders and whether they actually want predictability.
“You know I think that they say that. You know it sounds good to say. But, for years, the globalists, the big globalists, have been ripping off the United States, they’ve been taking money away from the United States, and all we’re doing is getting some of it back,” Trump said.

When Trump instituted his tariffs against Canada, Mexico, and China on Tuesday, the stock market plummeted, with leaders in U.S. industries ranging from automobiles to agriculture expressing fears about how they would be affected. On Wednesday, Trump announced a carve-out for U.S. automakers, and on Thursday announced Mexico and Canada would not pay tariffs on products that comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, until April 2.
The real goal of the tariffs against Canada, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt admitted Wednesday, is to decimate the country’s economy to force it to become the U.S. fifty-first state. Such an effort would further cause extreme economic confusion and ruin, and if Trump is serious, this tariff fight won’t end anytime soon. 
Amid a flurry of lawsuits against his administration, Trump is trying to make it a whole lot harder to sue him.
According to a memo sent to agency heads on Thursday, the White House is encouraging the use of a rarely used rule that would force anyone who sues the federal government to pay an upfront fee.
“It is the policy of the United States to demand that parties seeking injunctions against the Federal Government must cover the costs and damages incurred if the Government is ultimately found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained,” the memo obtained by CNN reads.
More than 100 lawsuits have been filed against the president since he took office in January. The cases range from challenging his immigration policies and funding cuts, to disputes against the Department of Government Efficiency’s attack on federal agencies. Many of the cases have been successful early on, and they are all ongoing. 
In the memo, the White House framed the cases as a waste of “substantial resources to fighting frivolous suits instead of defending public safety.”
“Taxpayers are forced not only to cover the costs of their antics when funding and hiring decisions are enjoined, but must needlessly wait for Government policies they voted for,” the memo reads.
The rule the White House is attempting to invoke is rarely used in the courts, and the financial barrier could prevent individuals, organizations, unions, and agencies from taking action against the president. 
It’s unclear exactly who would decide how much the plaintiff would have to pay, but the Justice Department would probably ask judges to set the amount, legal expert Mark Zaid told CNN. 
That means the fee could be as little as $1, and as high as … who knows? It’s yet another sly move from Trump to dodge accountability for his relentless attack on the Constitution.
The president has decided to throw some weight behind one of his closest advisers when it comes to dealing with South Africa.
Despite tariff-induced tumult at home, Donald Trump took the time Friday morning to lambast South Africa for how it treats its farmers, threatening aggressive foreign policy toward the continent’s strongest economy by announcing that the United States would stop all federal funding to the African nation.
“South Africa is being terrible, plus, to long time Farmers in the country,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “They are confiscating their LAND and FARMS, and MUCH WORSE THAN THAT. A bad place to be right now, and we are stopping all Federal Funding. To go a step further, any Farmer (with family!) from South Africa, seeking to flee that country for reasons of safety, will be invited into the United States of America with a rapid pathway to Citizenship. This process will begin immediately!”
The missive came hand in hand with a complaint from Elon Musk, who whined on X mere hours before that South Africa would not allow his international internet project to get off the ground, due to a lack of diversity at the billionaire’s company.
“Starlink is not allowed to operate in South Africa, because I’m not black,” Musk posted on X Friday morning.
But that wasn’t exactly an accurate reflection of why Musk’s home country has refused to approve SpaceX’s Starlink service.
The South African government’s Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment policy stipulates that all companies that do business in the nation must have at least 30 percent of their ownership or economic involvement owned by Black South Africans.
The mandate is a part of the country’s efforts to correct inequalities left in the wake of apartheid, striving to “advance economic transformation and enhance the economic participation of black people in the South African economy,” per the South African Department of Trade, Industry, and Competition. 
Musk has practically made the notion of diversity his enemy as he works—via the Department of Government Efficiency—to strip and defund federal agencies whose missions make mention of inclusivity efforts.
“DEI is just another word for racism,” Musk wrote in January. “Shame on anyone who uses it.”
The world’s richest man’s affinity for Nazi salutes have also called into question his racial ideology, especially as a descendant of Nazi sympathizers. That is according to his father, Errol Musk, who told the Podcast and Chill Network in November that the billionaire’s maternal grandparents supported Adolf Hitler and were members of the German Nazi Party in Canada before moving to South Africa in support of apartheid.
Pete Hegseth’s Department of Defense has marked an image of the USAAF B29 bomber that dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima for deletion—and its reason may be the perfect illustration of why right now really isn’t a good time to be closing the Department of Education.
That historical image was among 26,000 that were marked for deletion as part of the  DOD’s rushed efforts to weed out any traces of so-called diversity, equity, and inclusion by Wednesday, according to the Associated Press. The photograph was marked for removal because it prominently features the name of the aircraft: Enola Gay, named for the pilot Colonel Paul Tibbetts’s mother. 
The Associated Press published a database Thursday of thousands of images marked for deletion. While some of the photographs were still visible Thursday, it’s not clear if they will remain so. One official told the AP that close to 100,000 files could be deleted as part of the Pentagon’s latest purge. 
It’s not surprising that the sweep for DEI has consequently targeted the records and achievements of women and minorities in the military, removing mentions of Women’s History Month and Black History Month. One collection of images titled “Women’s History Month: All-female crew supports warfighters” saw its main page removed, though one photograph of an all-female C-17 crew remained. Another photograph titled “Engineering pioneer remembered during Black History Month” was deleted, as well. 
Other photographs swept up in the purge included those of service members with the last name Gay, war heroes such as Marine Corps World War II Medal of Honor recipient Private First Class Harold Gonsalves, and a photograph of a group of Army Corps biologists, who appeared to have earned their spot on the chopping block because they were collecting data about fish including, among other things, their gender.
Online, people weren’t at all impressed by the Pentagon’s thoughtless CTRL-F style of searching for woke.
Former Pentagon spokesperson Chris Meagher called the report “bonkers” in a post on X Thursday. 
Rick Pearson, a political reporter for the Chicago Tribune, called the Pentagon’s purge “complete lunacy and literally an attempt to whitewash history” in a post on X.
“Republicans spent years complaining about cancel culture and then took office and banned photos of the Enola Gay because it has the word gay in it,” posted Skyler Johnson, a candidate for New York State Senate. 
“These fuckers are bigots and fucking idiots too,” wrote Army veteran Fred Wellman, who hosts the podcast On Democracy. 
“What a piece of shit you are @SecDef,” he added in a second post. 
The president’s ruthless back-and-forth on enforcing sweeping tariffs against Canada and Mexico is starting to frustrate his MAGA allies.
Last month, Trump announced he would impose a 25 percent tariff on goods from America’s closest neighbors. Two days later, he backtracked, giving Canada and Mexico a one-month delay. On March 4, the tariffs went into effect, sparking retaliatory tariffs from Canada, as well as outcry from America’s Big Three automakers. 
Two days later, Trump directed another one-month pause for goods that met his 2020 trade deal, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which a White House official told CNBC covered roughly 50 percent of Mexican imports and 38 percent of Canadian imports. And then, in an interview that aired Friday, Trump said the tariffs could go higher than 25 percent.
As a result, the last week saw drastic market fluctuations, with the stock market tumbling as the tariffs went into effect. The Dow dropped 670 points, and by the end of the week, Republican lawmakers were fed up.
“Almost every industry in Kentucky has come to me and said, ‘It will hurt our industry and push up prices of homes, cars,’ and so, I’m gonna continue to argue against tariffs,” Senator Rand Paul told CNN on Thursday.
Senator Thom Tillis agreed that the administration should back off the tariffs if they were hurting constituents.
“When we start losing, you back off. There’s such a thing as strategic retreat,” Tillis told the network. “At the end of the day, I think we have more leverage than any other nation. But we gotta be smart. And we don’t have all the leverage.”
Louisiana Senator John Kennedy told Fox Business he was “worried” about the tariffs, adding that the president should “recalibrate” if the levies start to cause inflation—while insisting that he’s not doubting Trump’s leadership.
“I’m not saying that tariffs are going to cause inflation. President Trump did them in his first term and they didn’t,” Kennedy said. “I’m saying that we just don’t know. We’re in very obscure territory. We’re in uncharted waters. I think if the tariffs do start to cause inflation, I think the president will back away from them.”
Among other tariff proposals, Trump has enforced a 10 percent tariff hike on Chinese goods. That momentarily caused a panic in February for online retailers as the postal service placed a ban on Chinese packages, which it lifted days later. Casting China as a “bulwark of stability” against a backdrop of Trump-induced chaos, the Asian nation’s top diplomat Wang Yi said that China would “definitely, resolutely counter” America’s tariffs.
Donald Trump’s attempt to take over the National Labor Relations Board hit a snag from a federal judge Thursday.
Trump’s firing of Democratic board member Gwynne A. Wilcox was ruled unlawful by U.S. District Court Judge Beryl A. Howell, who ordered Wilcox’s immediate reinstatement and for her to serve out the remainder of her five-year term on the board, which began on September 6, 2023.
In her ruling, Howell wrote that the Constitution “made clear that no one in our system of government was meant to be king—the President included—and not just in name only.
“The President does not have the authority to terminate members of the National Labor Relations Board at will, and his attempt to fire plaintiff from her position on the Board was a blatant violation of the law,” Howell said.
“A president who touts an image of himself as a ‘king’ or a ‘dictator,’ perhaps as his vision of effective leadership, fundamentally misapprehends the role under Article II of the U.S. Constitution,” Howell added.
Wilcox filed the lawsuit last month after Trump fired her and the board’s general counsel, Jennifer Abruzzo, a fellow Biden appointee, leaving the board unable to function without a quorum. In a speech after the hearing Thursday, Wilcox said, “I’m ready to get back to work.”
“It’s not just about me, but I’m glad to be the face of this fight,” Wilcox said.
Trump, Elon Musk, and the rest of the right have long targeted the NLRB, and are in fact trying to get the Supreme Court to declare it unconstitutional and dismantle it with backing from corporations including Amazon, Starbucks, and Trader Joe’s. For now, at least, the NLRB is still around, with long legal fights ahead to save it as well as Wilcox’s position. 
Just hours after he rolled back tariffs on Mexico, the president announced Canada will also not pay tariffs on any products that comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, until April 2. It’s Trump’s third flip on tariffs in 72 hours.
He signed an executive order Thursday solidifying the one-month tariff delay on products from both countries.
On Tuesday, Trump implemented 25 percent tariffs on Mexico and Canada, a disastrous move that plummeted financial markets and prompted retaliatory actions from both U.S. trading partners.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau responded aggressively, immediately implementing retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods and condemning Trump’s betrayal of a longtime ally.
“Every country is very aware that if the American government is willing to do this to their own closest ally, neighbor, and friend, everyone is vulnerable to a trade war,” Trudeau said in a press conference on Tuesday, bypassing Trump and instead speaking directly to the American people.
“Your government has chosen to put American jobs at risk at the thousands of workplaces that succeed because of materials from Canada, or because of consumers in Canada, or both.”
Trump reacted to Trudeau’s address with hostility, and yet again suggested all of Canada’s problems could be solved by becoming the fifty-first American state. His dislike for Trudeau seemingly influenced his decision-making Thursday morning, when he initially retracted tariffs only on Mexico “out of respect” for Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, but not for Canada. Trump on Wednesday also granted a one-month exemption to U.S. automobile companies.
Unsurprisingly, the president has changed his mind yet again, drawing out a trade war that will have disastrous economic consequences. 
Notorious Medicare thief and Republican Senator Rick Scott is the only one who wants to admit that his GOP colleagues are plotting to gut an essential health care program. 
During an appearance at the Rescuing the American Dream Summit in Washington Thursday, Scott said it was only a matter of time before the government would have to cut spending to “any program you care about.”
“Because Medicare is going bankrupt, Social Security is going bankrupt. You know, inflation can’t go away, interest rates can’t come down. So, my belief is that … we’re gonna have to do this,” the Florida Republican said. 
Scott knows a thing or two about bankrupting Medicare. He served as CEO of Columbia/HCA Hospital, which was fined a total of $1.7 billion in 2003 for filing false Medicare claims. At the time, it was the largest health care fraud in history, and while that particular honor has since been passed to another, Scott’s honor remains unrestored. 
Scott is one of the few Republicans who doesn’t seem to be in denial about what having approved the latest budget bill to power Donald Trump’s agenda really means. The bill requires the Committee on Energy and Commerce, which oversees Medicaid, to reduce the deficit by at least $880 billion from 2025 to 2034. Mathematically speaking, cuts that big can only come out of massive programs such as Medicaid.
Cutting the incredibly popular program will undoubtedly prove, well, unpopular, but some Republicans have another strategy: Deny, deny, deny. 
Republican Representative Brandon Gill tiptoed around the issue during an interview on Fox Business Thursday, driving host Maria Bartiromo up the wall. 
“Congressman, I mean, with all due respect, you haven’t given me one offset,” Bartiromo pressed. “OK? You say that you’re not gonna have one problem finding an offset, and so far all I’ve heard you talk about is Elon Musk’s fraud, waste, and abuse cuts, as well as eliminating climate change rules. Again, 76 percent of the money is going to mandatory spending. You know that better than anyone! I’ve got the numbers in front of me. You’ve got $36 trillion in debt.
“Isn’t it time to start looking at the mandatory spending, and trying to figure out how you’re actually gonna cut—I mean, I know nobody wants to say this, but you’ve got stuff like Medicaid, don’t you?” Bartiromo asked. 
Gill insisted he had described areas that could be cut, but noted that, “I agree with you, we are going to have to find some rationalizations.”
Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency used the U.S. Marshals to physically take over a government agency Thursday, and now that agency head is suing. 
Five employees of DOGE along with deputy acting head of the U.S. Agency for International Aid, Peter Marocco, tried to enter the U.S. African Development Foundation headquarters on Wednesday, but were prevented from getting into the building by security and were forced to leave. 
USADF staff told a security guard to deny access to the DOGE team and Marocco, who illegally entered the Capitol during the January 6 insurrection, and whom Trump is trying to install as the agency’s new chief. The agency’s employees cited a letter from the USADF’s current chair, Ward Brehm, which stated, “In my absence, I have specifically instructed the staff of USADF to adhere to our rules and procedure of not allowing any meetings of this type without my presence. 
“I will look forward to working with Mr. Marocco after such time that he is nominated for a seat on the Board and his nomination is confirmed by the Senate,” Brehm wrote in the letter. “Until these legal requirements are met, Mr. Marocco does not hold any position or office with USADF, and he may not speak or act on the Foundation’s behalf.”
On Thursday, Marocco and DOGE staffers returned to the agency—this time, with the U.S. Marshals. They were able to enter the building, which had no staff present, according to a government source.
Hours later, Brehm filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court against Marocco and DOGE, which detailed how the group initially threatened to sue the security guard barring them access, and told the building’s property manager that they would bring U.S. Marshals and Secret Service agents if they weren’t allowed into the building.
“Their threats were unsuccessful” that day, the lawsuit states. 
Marocco and DOGE staff were trying to carry out Trump’s February 19 executive order, in which he declared the USADF and three other agencies “unnecessary” and subject to elimination. The agency, created by Congress in 1980, supports small businesses and grassroots organizations helping marginalized people in Africa through grants. From 2019 to 2023, it funded 1,050 community enterprises serving 6.2 million people with $141 million in grants.
“Any attempt to unilaterally dismantle the USADF through executive action violates the law and exceeds the constitutional limits of executive authority,” wrote Democratic members of the House’s Foreign Affairs Committee in a letter to President Trump last month. 
While DOGE eventually forced its way into the agency, its chief was able to file a lawsuit before any agency staff were fired. Will the maneuver protect the agency and force the Trump administration to close it through congressional action, or is USADF only delaying the inevitable? "
94,2025-03-07,"Developing advanced AI models is seemingly getting pricer, prompting OpenAI to potentially raise the cost for specialized AI agents to $20,000 per month.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

With the rapid emergence of generative AI, top AI labs, including OpenAI, Microsoft, and Anthropic are scaling their developments and releasing advanced AI models. However, the cost implication tied to scaling greater heights is increasingly becoming higher.
According to a report by The Information, OpenAI is in discussions to raise the cost of its advanced AI models. The report details that the ChatGPT maker could charge up to $2,000/month for a “high-income knowledge worker” AI agent and $10,000/month for a software developer agent.
Perhaps more interestingly, OpenAI could even charge up to $20,000/month for an AI agent that can support “PhD-level research.” This is amid the multiple bankruptcy reports that emerged last year, suggesting OpenAI is on the verge of bankruptcy, with projections of a $5 billion loss within a year.
However, the report suggests that SoftBank will spend up to $3 billion to support the development of OpenAI's agentic AI products in 2025. As you may know, the AI firm recently launched its $500 billion Stargate project to facilitate the construction of data centers across the United States to bolster its AI advances amid emerging completion from Chinese AI startup DeepSeek.

A separate report suggests that OpenAI is in discussions to raise $40 billion through another round of funding, pushing its market capitalization to approximately $340 billion. SoftBank will reportedly lead the funding round with a stake of between $15 billion and $25 billion, potentially dethroning Microsoft as OpenAI's largest investor, passing on the crown to SoftBank.
This is after the ChatGPT maker raised $6.6 billion last year through a funding round from investors, including Microsoft, NVIDIA, Thrive Capital, SoftBank, and more, pushing its market valuation to $157 billion.
However, the capital raised by investors comes with its fair share of challenges, including turning into a for-profit entity. Market analysts and experts predict OpenAI could be susceptible to outsider interference and hostile takeovers if it fails to meet the for-profit threshold within two years.
All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.
This would require it to reimburse investors for funds raised to keep its operations afloat. More concerning, analysts predict Microsoft could acquire OpenAI within three years as investor interest in the AI bubble fades and partnership frays.
Despite OpenAI's milestones and uncontested 2-year lead in the AI landscape, the ChatGPT maker could make $44 billion in losses before potentially becoming profitable in 2029.
Some of the losses are attributed to the cost of training and running advanced AI models, employee salaries, data, and Microsoft tie-up, which reportedly gets a 20% cut of OpenAI's revenue.
The Information reports OpenAI's computing expenses could shoot up to $37.5 billion annually by 2029, which in comparison to its $300 million monthly revenue, is a drop in the ocean.
It'll be interesting to watch how the potentially changes in OpenAI's model pricing affects user adoption. The reported move isn't entirely surprising, especially after the company unveiled ChatGPT Pro, a new subscription that costs $200 a month for exclusive access to its advanced AI models that think harder for the most complex problems.
This report comes at a crucial time when studies are raising critical questions about the importance of AI in our lives. A recent report by Microsoft researchers indicated that an overreliance on AI-powered tools like Copilot and ChatGPT might have long-term negative effects on someone's cognitive faculties, seemingly making them dumb.
Interestingly, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates also indicated that AI has a high affinity of replacing humans for most things, and potentially even stealing his job.
It's worth noting that AI startups like DeepSeek are developing AI models that surpass proprietary AI models like OpenAI's o1 reasoning model at a fraction of its cost. However, recent reports suggest that the Chinese startup used OpenAI and Microsoft's copyrighted data to reduce the cost of developing and training its ultra-cost-effective model.
Would you pay $20,000/month for OpenAI's advanced AI models? Share your thoughts with us in the comments.

Brazil has ordered Apple to enable sideloading within 90 days or face fines.
Apple has been forced to enable sideloading for iPhone users in Brazil within the next three months or face daily fines for non-compliance. On Wednesday, Judge Pablo Zuniga of the Brazilian federal court ordered Apple to allow third-party app marketplaces in the country within the next 90 days. If the company fails to adhere to the court's order, it could face a fine of more than $40,000 per day.The judge said the iPhone maker ""has already complied with similar obligations in other countries, without demonstrating a significant impact or irreparable damage to its business model."" The European Union similarly forced Apple to comply with its Digital Markets Act in 2024. With the introduction of iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 18, Apple enabled sideloading for iPhone and iPad users within the EU.Now, Brazil wants Apple to do the same. As spotted by 9to5mac, and originally reported by the Brazilian publication Valor Economico, Judge Zuniga explained that the ""limitations"" Apple has imposed on developers could prevent future competitors from entering the market.In a response to the Brazilian publication, an Apple spokesperson said that the company ""believes in vibrant and competitive markets,"" adding that the iPhone maker ""faces competition in all segments and jurisdictions"" where it operates.The original antitrust complaint was filed against Apple in 2022 by Brazilian regulator Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Economica, or CADE. After an investigation and a bad ruling for Apple, an unreasonable implementation timeline was proposed and quickly overturned. More recently, in February 2025, the regulator held a public hearing on the issue.Apple plans to fight the ruling of the Brazilian federal court, saying that the proposed changes would outright harm the privacy and security of iPhone and iPad users. The entire process could continue for months, and the outcome remains to be seen, but there is a decent chance Apple could be forced into compliance in one way or another.
On Wednesday, Judge Pablo Zuniga of the Brazilian federal court ordered Apple to allow third-party app marketplaces in the country within the next 90 days. If the company fails to adhere to the court's order, it could face a fine of more than $40,000 per day.
The judge said the iPhone maker ""has already complied with similar obligations in other countries, without demonstrating a significant impact or irreparable damage to its business model."" 
The European Union similarly forced Apple to comply with its Digital Markets Act in 2024. With the introduction of iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 18, Apple enabled sideloading for iPhone and iPad users within the EU.
Now, Brazil wants Apple to do the same. As spotted by 9to5mac, and originally reported by the Brazilian publication Valor Economico, Judge Zuniga explained that the ""limitations"" Apple has imposed on developers could prevent future competitors from entering the market.

In a response to the Brazilian publication, an Apple spokesperson said that the company ""believes in vibrant and competitive markets,"" adding that the iPhone maker ""faces competition in all segments and jurisdictions"" where it operates.
The original antitrust complaint was filed against Apple in 2022 by Brazilian regulator Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Economica, or CADE. After an investigation and a bad ruling for Apple, an unreasonable implementation timeline was proposed and quickly overturned. More recently, in February 2025, the regulator held a public hearing on the issue.
Apple plans to fight the ruling of the Brazilian federal court, saying that the proposed changes would outright harm the privacy and security of iPhone and iPad users. The entire process could continue for months, and the outcome remains to be seen, but there is a decent chance Apple could be forced into compliance in one way or another.

Side loading is moronic and stupid, and only an idiot would suggest it. I feel sorry that some idiot is attempting to “require” it.

I suspect not a lot of side loading is happening in the EU or elsewhere, even Android side loading is a minor part of app usage on that platform.In the end, side loading is about money and where that money goes - to Apple for providing and developing the platform or software developers for developing their products. Both deserve compensation. Consumers gain control but probably won’t save money and, to the extent that Apple loses money to developers and seeks new revenue streams from consumers, may pay more.

Apple is completely free to limit its platform to its own first party apps. Apple can then try to charge its customers even more for using a walled off store that has its own paid apps on top of what is included in the price of the device (because those operating costs are factored into the device price to a degree. However, If it wants to open up its platform to outside developers then things change a lot. That is what we are seeing here. It is simply another jurisdiction applying these measures. Apple has chosen wisely (even if it was nudged to allow third party stores in the EU and current compliance efforts might be fined) and allowed third party stores. Now it simply has to persuade developers and users to use its store over others.
