Tesla stock plunged 15 percent on Monday, its steepest drop in five years. The price is down over 50 percent since its December highs. Tesla owners, disgusted with Elon Musk’s slash-and-burn tactics for the Trump administration, are selling their vehicles at a big loss. And Tesla showrooms across the country are becoming magnets for large crowds of protesters who want to see the company fail spectacularly. 
But at least Musk can still count on one guy to have his back. 
“I’m going to buy a brand new Tesla tomorrow morning as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American,” President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday. “Why should he be punished for putting his tremendous skills to work in order to help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN???”
But it will probably take more than a Cybertruck in the presidential motorcade to make Tesla great again. It will take an actual commitment to more affordable electric vehicles. It will take a more serious and safer approach to driverless cars. And it may take a change of leadership to get the company back on track. Let’s run down the company’s problems.
Trump’s election last year sent Tesla’s stock price soaring, as investors rewarded Musk for making the right political bet. It hit a record high of $488 in mid-December; by early March, it had sunk to roughly $226. 
The wipeout erased over $800 billion in market value, Tesla’s steepest drop in years. Musk’s own net worth took an over $100 billion hit. (But don’t worry: he’s still the richest man in the world.)
What happened? Setting Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) side quest and the resulting protests aside for a moment, the simplest explanation is that Tesla’s sales suck. The company produced 4 percent fewer cars in 2024 than it did the previous year. And its deliveries were essentially flat. Tesla earnings came in light, even with a Bitcoin boost.
Musk’s own net worth took an over $100 billion hit.
In California, Tesla’s biggest market in the US, its sales dropped almost 8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024 and 12 percent for the year. Coastal elites’ love affair with the brand has soured. 
And it’s not just in the US. In February, Tesla’s sales were down 10 percent in Spain, 42 percent in Sweden, 45 percent in France, 48 percent in Norway and Denmark, 53 percent in Portugal, 55 percent in Italy, and a whopping 76 percent in Germany. Musk’s endorsement may have helped Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party place second in the recent election, but it doesn’t seem to have improved his company’s flagging sales in Europe — down 45 percent in January year over year. 
In China, the world’s largest car market, Tesla is on a sustained losing streak. The company has been backsliding for the past five consecutive months on a year-on-year basis, according to data from the country’s Passenger Car Association. Some of this is likely related to a temporary factory suspension to accommodate the new Model Y Juniper assembly line, but rising competition from domestic automakers like BYD is putting increased pressure on Tesla. 
And unlike BYD, Tesla doesn’t sell any hybrid vehicles. It has nothing to fall back on when consumers feel anxious about the future of electric vehicles.
A frequent criticism you see about Tesla is that the company’s vehicle lineup is getting a little long in the tooth. The Model X turns 10 this year, while the Model S is pushing 15. Both vehicles have only received minor updates since their initial launch. (A Tesla executive promised a refresh later this year.)
The Model 3 and Model Y, which represent the bulk of the company’s automotive revenues, were both updated recently, but the lag in regular updates has opened a window of opportunity for Tesla’s competitors. Consumers interested in plug-in power suddenly have a wealth of choices as newer, more interesting EVs from Hyundai, Kia, Honda, and General Motors hit the market. 
Meanwhile, Tesla’s only new model to be introduced in the last five years is the Cybertruck, which has been recalled seven times since its launch. Musk has said that frequent software updates obviate the need for a more regular cadence of model refreshes. 
While Tesla sales dropped, sales of non-Tesla EVs continued to climb. Americans bought a record 1.3 million electric cars, an increase of 7.3 percent year over year, according to Cox Automotive’s Kelley Blue Book. EVs now claim 8.1 percent of the market in the US. 
Americans aren’t souring on electric vehicles — they’re just over Tesla. 
For years, Musk has been promising to make an affordable electric vehicle, likely priced at $25,000. He first mentioned it in a 2018 interview, saying, “A $25,000 car, that’s something we can do.” Then, in 2020, at the company’s first Battery Day event, he speculated that Tesla could eventually produce upward of 20 million of these vehicles in a year — or roughly twice the current production of Toyota, GM, or Volkswagen.
Musk has said the more affordable EV would be built on the company’s next-generation vehicle platform. But rather than prioritize a vehicle that investors took to calling the “Model 2,” he spent Tesla’s resources on the expensive, polarizing Cybertruck. And after some initial excitement, the truck has turned into a flop. Musk predicted that Tesla would eventually sell 500,000 Cybertrucks a year. Last year, the company only sold an estimated 40,000. 
Americans aren’t souring on electric vehicles — they’re just over Tesla. 
Musk has also actively gummed up the works for a cheaper Tesla vehicle. Last year, he reportedly canceled the company’s plans to build a low-cost electric vehicle in favor of going all in on a robotaxi. But after some pushback, he claimed that a cheaper Tesla was back on the menu — only now, the vehicles are expected to be built on the same platform as the Model 3 and Model Y. Now, investors are worried that this new vehicle will cannibalize Model 3 and Model Y sales rather than boost the company’s profits overall. 
Meanwhile, Kia and Volkswagen have announced plans to actually produce affordable EVs. And China has cracked the code on budget-priced, highly affordable EVs. The BYD Seagull, for example, was the country’s bestselling vehicle last summer, with about 190 miles of range and a sticker price of around $10,000. Even with a 100 percent tariff, the Seagull would still sell for a price much cheaper than most US-made EVs.
Of course, Musk doesn’t think Tesla even needs a $25,000 vehicle. The company’s future is in AI — specifically self-driving cars and humanoid robots. In October 2024, he undercut his company’s own guidance to make “affordable models” by commenting, “I think having a regular $25,000 model is pointless. It would be silly. It would be completely at odds with what we believe.”
Musk now believes that Tesla is on the verge of solving autonomy. He’s claimed that fully autonomous vehicles are right around the corner for almost a decade now. “Optimus has the potential to be north of $10 trillion in revenue,” he said during the most recent earnings call, referring to Tesla’s humanoid robots. 
“I think having a regular $25,000 model is pointless.”
But while Musk bloviates about robots, Waymo and others are operating real driverless cars on the road. The Alphabet-owned company just launched its first partnership with Uber in Austin, Texas — Tesla’s headquarters and the city where Musk has said he plans on launching his own robotaxi project this summer. 
There’s little evidence that Tesla is on the cusp of delivering what Waymo has already done. The promise that all Tesla vehicles built after 2016 have the hardware necessary for full self-driving turned out to be totally false. Musk said the company would replace the onboard computers for vehicle owners who bought the FSD package, a process he admitted would be “painful.” Tesla has already been targeted with a class action lawsuit claiming the company lied about the capabilities of its vehicles. 
And then there’s Elon. And DOGE. And the fascist salute. And the chainsaw. And everything else going on behind those dark sunglasses. 
Musk’s antics have turned the Tesla brand toxic. Disillusioned owners are selling their vehicles at big losses. Others are swapping in badges from other vehicle brands or using desperate-sounding stickers to signal their dissatisfaction with the billionaire CEO. 
And even more are protesting outside Tesla showrooms as part of a grassroots effort to oppose Musk’s takeover of the federal government, damage the company’s stock price, and maybe even slash the world’s richest man’s net worth. 
Separately, there have been a growing number of reports of arson and vandalism at the company’s stores. Tesla charging stations have been set on fire. A showroom in Oregon was shot up. A woman was arrested in Colorado for throwing a Molotov cocktail at a Tesla location. Tesla vehicles have been defaced with swastikas and expletives. Four Cybertrucks were destroyed in a fire in Seattle. The rage is real. 
Keep in mind, Tesla’s sales were already dropping before all these incidents occurred. The growing dissatisfaction has led some analysts to predict even more dire numbers for the company’s first quarter results this spring. 
It’s unclear what can turn the company’s fortunes around. Some supporters have started to openly question whether Tesla can continue to survive with Musk at the helm. But shareholders aren’t likely to jettison the controversial CEO yet, especially after voting to approve his multibillion-dollar pay package last summer. The outcome was a huge vote of confidence in Musk’s leadership — and a big validator of his behavior. 
But that was pre-DOGE, before the salute, and before the stock wipeout. Tesla’s board is clearly feeling the pinch. Chair Robyn Denholm and director James Murdoch (son of Rupert Murdoch) both sold millions of dollars’ worth of shares in the past month. 
A lot rests on Musk’s promises of a cheaper Tesla, a next-generation vehicle platform, and an actual working robotaxi service. President Trump can buy all the Teslas he wants, but if Tesla’s future is built on a bunch of falsehoods and fantasies, it’s unlikely the company can emerge from this fire unscathed.

Eight tech billionaires have seen their combined fortunes shrink by an estimated $266 billion this year as President Donald Trump's policies continue to spook investors.

        That figure exceeds the market value of most of America's largest companies including Salesforce, McDonald's, and Wells Fargo.
    

        Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk leads the list of wealth losers, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The world's richest person has had $132 billion, or 30% of his fortune, wiped out in the past 10 weeks following the 45% slide in Tesla stock in that period.
    

        Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Oracle's Larry Ellison, Dell Technologies' Michael Dell, and Nvidia's Jensen Huang have each seen more than $20 billion erased from their respective net worths this year as their companies' stock prices have tumbled. Amazon and Oracle are both down about 11%, while Dell and Nvidia have slumped by north of 20%.
    

        Rounding out the group are Alphabet cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin — down about $18 billion and $17 billion each this year following a 12% drop in shares of Google's parent company —and Steve Ballmer, who's down about $13 billion after a 10% decline in Microsoft stock.
    

        The eight tech titans' collective net worth fell by $64 billion on Monday alone as the Nasdaq Composite slid 4%, its steepest one-day loss since 2022.
    

        The sell-off was sparked by Trump cautioning there would be a ""period of transition"" for the US economy in a Fox News interview on Sunday.
    

        The president didn't rule out a recession when asked if he expected one this year. He said his focus was on strengthening America and achieving long-term prosperity: ""You can't really watch the stock market.""
    

        Trump's sweeping economic agenda is focused on equalizing US trade relations using tariffs, curtailing immigration, lifting regulations, cutting taxes, and downsizing the federal government. His policies have reignited inflation fears and stoked recession worries.
    

        The increased uncertainty has dampened the buzz around AI that had lifted tech stocks and the wider market to record highs this year. One consequence is the world's 16 wealthiest people are worth $236 billion less than they were at the start of January after a $87 billion decline on Monday, per Bloomberg's rich list.
    

        Microsoft's Bill Gates and Meta's Mark Zuckerberg were still up between $4 billion and $5 billion for the year at Monday's close. The Facebook cofounder took a $9.5 billion wealth hit on the day — second only to Musk's $29 billion blow.
    

        Three others on the list are in the green for 2025 as they're less exposed to tech: Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett is up about $14 billion, while LVMH's Bernard Arnault and Inditex's Amancio Ortega are up between $6 billion and $7 billion.
    

        The richest of the rich shouldn't feel too sorry for themselves, as they had a stellar 2024. The top 10 billionaires at the end of December were up more than $500 billion for the year, and worth a combined $2 trillion — about as much as Amazon or Alphabet.

The U.S. stock market fell again yesterday, leaving investors worried that President Trump's tariffs could slow down the economy and potentially lead to a recession. The Dow, which tracks 30 major U.S. companies, fell 890 points, or nearly 2.1%, yesterday. The S&P fell by 2.7% and the Nasdaq slumped 4%.

A federal judge in New York has ordered the government not to deport Mahmoud Khalil, who was arrested Saturday by ICE officers. Khalil, a lawful permanent U.S. resident and recent Columbia University graduate, participated in college protests against the Israel-Gaza war. He was sent to a detention center in Louisiana to await deportation. 
For the first time, every U.S. state and the District of Columbia have seen at least some recovery from the fentanyl crisis, as the deadliest phase appears to have ended. A new analysis of the U.S. overdose data by researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill shows that a decline in the death toll linked to the drug began much earlier than once understood. The findings suggest improvements may be sustainable. Drug overdose deaths in the U.S. dropped to 87,000 from October 2023 to September 2024, down from around 114,000 the previous year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Here's a state-by-state breakdown of the drop in overdose deaths from when they peaked.

All eyes are on Wisconsin this year. A spring election has attracted significant donations as control of the state's Supreme Court hangs in the balance. Voters may feel déja vu: Two years ago, two candidates competed for an open seat in a high-profile court race, drawing attention nationwide. Interest groups contributed millions of dollars to influence the outcome. Early predictions indicate that the current race is set to be more expensive than the 2023 election. Here's why state Supreme Court races can be so costly and combative:

3,2025-03-11,"Like Bigfoot or the chupacabra, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 is being spotted in the wild by ravenous GPU buyers ready to believe any hint of a footprint indicates how powerful a beast they are. If anything, the latest leaks suggest we may be on track for a full reveal as soon as this week. The first hints of the card found in a pre-built desktop tower indicate the next Blackwell GPU could be relatively cheap, but that may not matter much if Team Greenâs next graphics card is limited on VRAM.
French retailers are already promoting pre-configured desktop towers sporting a Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060.Â As first spotted by the sleuths atÂ Videocardz, thereâs an Acer Nitro 50 tower containing a 14th-gen Intel Core i7-14700F CPU alongside Nvidiaâs new lower-end graphics card (it’s listed as a PCIe x16 card, which may be incorrect but we’ll find out soon enough). The French seller EvoPC is selling the tower for 1,590 euros, or a little more than $1,737. The jury is still out on whether that config is worth it, even with 32 GB of RAM.
On Thursday, an Acer spokesperson sent us a note saying the Nitro 50 was posted “in error” and the listing has since been pulled down.
A similar config with the Acer Nitro 60 on Amazon containing a last-gen RTX 4060 may go for between $1,520 and $1,541 from various sellers. That may not mean much, considering the Nitro 50 and 60 configs have been around since 2022. Since itâs a French seller, those prices may not reflect Acerâs commitment to a 10% markup for U.S. customers due to Trump tariffs.
The other element the listing potentially confirms is the 8GB of GDDR7 VRAM. Earlier this week, the usually accurate Nvidia leaker that goes by kopite7kimi posted supposed specs for an RTX 5050, RTX 5060, and RTX 5060 Ti. The RTX 5060 may hold 3,840 CUDA cores and a 150 W power draw. Thatâs a 25% uptick from the Ada Lovelace architecture at the same level from 2022. That sounds good until you notice the 8 GB of VRAM. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 was already relatively limited at higher resolutions, and the squeezed memory didnât help it.
As for the 5060 Ti, the core counts are less dramatic, going from 4,352 on the 4060 Ti to 4,608. Just remember that core counts donât offer more than a small window into the full picture of the GPUâs capabilities. The general fear is that the 5060 Ti wonât be a major uplift in gen-on-gen performance, similar to the RTX 4070 Ti Super compared to the RTX 5070 Ti. At the very least, according to the leaks, you can get the RTX 5060 Ti in both 8 GB and 16 GB GDDR7 RAM variants. It will have a 180W power draw.
Like the RTX 5070 Ti, Nvidia doesnât seem willing to wait to share its “titanium” edition GPUs. If we believe the leaks, other changes will come to Nvidiaâs desktop GPU slate. Those leaks indicate the RTX 5050 could come in desktop form, where it was relegated to laptops on the RTX 40-series. That, too, will sit at a mere 8 GB VRAM and 2,560 of the Blackwell CUDA cores. What this means for the low-end GPU is still in flux. Each of these GPUs should be able to use DLSS 4 and multi-frame gen, so weâll see if that can push the envelope more than it did while trying to eek 4K performance from the 5070.
Meanwhile, AMD seems to have a plan to stick 16GB of GDDR6 VRAM into all its cards. Rumors reported by Videocardz indicate the 9060 wants to compete at the 60-level just as well as it did against the 70s. None of this really changes the landscape until we get an idea about the price. Nvidia still has its work cut out for itself, trying to make sure thereâs enough supply for this launch.
Update 03/13/25 at 4:30 p.m. ET: This post was updated to include a note from Acer that the EvoPC listing has since been pulled.

          It's hard to recommend you jump in line for an AMD Radeon RX 9070, when the RX 9070 XT is so good and costs just $50 more.
        

          At $600, AMD's Radeon RX 9070 XT is just where it needs to be to compete for 4K gaming against the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti.
        

          Nvidia's RTX 5070 won't hit RTX 4090 levels of performance even with multi-frame gen, but it works well for those who have a 1440p setup.

5,2025-03-11,"As the U.S. stock market grapples with volatility due to tariff concerns and recession fears, investors are increasingly seeking stability in their..."
6,2025-03-11,"""It is a shake-up,"" Johnson said, trying to deflect blame from Trump to Biden.
House Speaker Mike Johnson and other Republicans are dismissing stock market turmoil and recession concerns as they defend President Donald Trump's tariff policies.
""It is a shake-up and he said there is going to be a shake-up right now but this is what is required, in my mind, to start the process of repairing and restoring the American economy,"" Johnson said on Tuesday when asked if Trump needed to rethink an approach that's provoking uncertainty that roiled Wall Street investors.
""I believe the strategy is going to work ... I think you got to give it time,"" Johnson added at the House GOP's weekly press conference. ""He's been in office just over, what, 50 days? This is the 51st day in office. Give the president a chance to have his policies play out.""
Johnson then went so far as to contend the market meltdown is a result of Biden-era policies -- a deflection also being used by the White House as Trump officials contend the U.S. is facing an ""economic transition.""
""He's got to reshape and shape things, because it's in a real mess,"" Johnson said. ""The last four years was a disaster.""
Later on Tuesday afternoon, in a legislative maneuver, House Republicans successfully blocked Democrats from forcing votes and debate on Trump's controversial tariffs.
To tee up Johnson's temporary government funding bill, the House first needed to pass what's known as ""a rule"" Tuesday afternoon. Buried inside the text of that rule is legislative language that prevents Democrats from forcing a potentially politically painful vote to end Trump's tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China until at least January 2026.
Democrats are blasting the move.
""Guess what they tucked into this rule, hoping nobody would notice? They slipped in a little clause letting them escape ever having to debate or vote on Trump's tariffs. Isn't that clever?"" Rep. Jim McGovern, the top Democrat on the House Rules Committee, said during floor debate Tuesday.
Despite pledging during the 2024 campaign that Trump would supercharge the economy on Day 1, House Republicans have so far appeared not to be bothered by the market upheaval and continue to blame Democrats for the state of the economy.
""Everybody relax. It's going to be okay. Those of you that have your money in the market, don't pull it out now,"" Rep. Troy Nehls, a Texas Republican and staunch Trump supporter, told ABC News. Nehls contended ""everything will rebound.""
Asked if what's unfolding is hurting Trump politically, Nehls shifted to talk about Democrats, ""What everybody is seeing is, obviously what they're seeing is the Democrats don't like what Donald Trump is doing, and they're scaring the hell out of people.""
Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, a New York Republican, also isn't concerned about recent events. She told ABC News, ""I think that's just temporary. You'll see things get better.""
When asked about Trump's campaign promises on the economy, Malliotakis also pivoted to blame the previous administration.
""You got to remember that we had four years of a terrible economy because of Joe Biden. Look at what Joe Biden did that was so destructive, the reckless, wasteful spending that was inflationary, the regulations that he added that were burdensome,"" she said.
Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga., told ABC News he supports the tariffs and said their impact on the market will ""depend on how permanent they are.""
""A threat can have volatility per day, but if it doesn't stay permanent, that threat goes away,"" he added.
Asked if Trump would be at fault if Americans ended up paying more because of the policies, McCormick argued they are already ""paying more because we have unfair trade with other countries.""
Meanwhile, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer placed the blame for recession fears squarely on President Donald Trump's tariffs and rhetoric during floor remarks on Tuesday. He challenged Trump's assertion that this would be a ""golden age"" in America, citing downturned markets and ballooning costs.
""More trouble for the Trump administration: The Trump economy. Donald Trump promised Americans a golden age on day one. Well today is day 50. And Americans are wondering, scratching their heads, where is this golden age? Can't find this golden age in the inflation numbers because inflation has gone up under Donald Trump from groceries to retail to cars. The idea that he said in the campaign prices will be going down on day one that's by the wayside that's for sure,"" Schumer said in floor remarks.
ABC News' Allison Pecorin contributed to this report.

Donald Trump is getting his hands on a brand-new Tesla, but which model is best for the leader of the free world?

        With five Tesla models currently on the market, Trump had a number of considerations to make: like whether he wanted more headroom, more speed, or more controversy.
    

        A parade of shiny new Teslas pulled up to the White House on Tuesday, following Trump's announcement that he would be buying one of the EVs to support his right-hand-man Elon Musk's company.
    

        The electric vehicle company has been struggling ever since Musk became the de-facto leader of DOGE — its stock has plummeted, protests have erupted at showrooms around the country, owners have been offloading their vehicles, and investors are worried.
    

        Here's what Tesla models Trump had to consider — and what he ultimately decided on.
    

        If Trump wanted to save the most money, he would have chosen the Model 3 sedan or Model Y SUV.
    

        With a starting price of around $42,000 and $46,000, respectively, the Model 3 and Model Y are Tesla's EVs for the masses — and a key part of Musk's plan to expand electric mobility globally.
    

        Despite being packed with advanced tech and capable of excellent performance, their position as entry-level models and minimalist interiors feels like an unlikely choice for the President's tastes.


        Though Trump has been working to save money for the federal government, as someone with an apartment modeled after the Palace of Versailles, he's not known for being particularly frugal with his own money.
    

        The original Roadster may have been the first Tesla, but it was the Model S that put the EV maker on the map and solidified Musk's position as an innovator in the automotive industry.
    

        The Model S is Tesla's performance flagship, a superlative that will certainly catch Trump's attention. In fact, two Model S vehicles were presented to Trump outside the White House on Tuesday.
    

        The Model S's fastest variant, the ""plaid,"" has a top speed of 200 mph and can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in less than 2 seconds, making it one of the world's 10 fastest-accelerating production cars.
    

        That's enough to make Trump the king of the dragstrip.
    

        The Model S also offers its own kind of Secret Service — a security feature called ""Sentry Mode,"" which uses the car's external cameras to monitor and provide a live feed of outside threats to the vehicle.
    

        With recent reports of Teslas being vandalized, this feature would help protect Trump's car out in public, though it is difficult to imagine a president's car ever being parked out on the street.
    

        At the White House presentation of Teslas, Trump held in his hand a list of vehicle options that included a silver Model X for $112,490.
    

        Although the Model X is nearly a decade old now, it's still the most interesting and daring vehicle in Tesla's lineup, with a single-piece glass roof windshield and automatic falcon wing doors.
    

        It's a vehicle Musk once called a ""work of art"" and the Faberg egg of cars.
    

        On the practical side, if Trump wanted the Tesla with the most headroom for himself and his tall family — Trump's height is listed at 6 foot 3 inches, and his son Barron is between 6 foot 7 and 9 inches — then the Model X would have been the way to go.
    

        With all add-on features included, the four-door SUV Model X can cost over $116,000 (before tax breaks), making it the priciest Tesla on the market.
    

        And as a seven-seater vehicle, Trump and every member of his immediate family — Melania, Tiffany, Barron, Ivanka, Don Jr., and Eric — would all fit into the car at once, though it would likely be a much tighter squeeze than the billionaire family is used to.
    

        As the most expensive Tesla, the Model S may have swayed Trump the most, particularly if he wants to give his buddy's struggling company the biggest boost.
    

        Tesla's boldly styled Cyberstruck was sure to, at the very least, grab Trump's attention.
    

        The controversial Cybertruck — the subject of widespread ridicule on social media as well as in real-life attacks — would certainly have made the biggest statement as a show of support for Musk. And as Trump said in his Tuesday tweet, supporting Musk is his main goal in buying a Tesla.
    

        When all add-on features are included, the four-door Cybertruck in Cyberbeast mode can cost over $111,000.
    

        The Cybertruck offers a bit more security than other Tesla models because of its tougher exterior and windows. Still, the EV isn't quite as tough or bulletproof as Musk has claimed. The Cybertruck's stainless steel paneling has been reported to withstand bullets from a handgun, but not from faster weapons. And its ""armor glass"" windows famously broke during an onstage demonstration at Cybertruck's launch.
    

        One thing Trump may have considered here though is that he does already have a Cybertruck, which was given to him as a gift from conservative, high-profile streamer Adin Ross. And Trump's ultimate choice of Tesla shows he just might not have been ready for His and Hers Cybertrucks.
    

        Trump appears to have selected a red Model S Tesla sedan — the automaker's fastest option.
    

        ""The one I like is that one, and I want the same color,"" Trump said, pointing to a red Model S, according to NBC News.
    

        Trump told reporters at the event, parts of which were livestreamed on the White House's X account, that as the president he's not allowed to drive on regular roads. But he could likely drive around the White House complex, as Barack Obama once did with Jerry Seinfeld on ""Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee."" Trump said since he can't use the car himself, he'll keep it at the White House for staff to use.

Time is ticking for Tesla's promised lower-cost vehicle.

        The electric car giant said in its most recent earnings call earlier this year that production for the long-awaited ""more affordable"" Tesla would begin in the first half of 2025.
    

        That means Tesla has three and a half months to deliver.
    

        With Tesla's stock facing choppy waters, analysts tell BI the launch is ""crucial"" and a ""necessity.""
    

Elon Musk has promised a cheaper EV for years. A sub-$30,000 model would likely drive sales for the automaker, which hasn't been immune to the impact of slowing EV adoption and pricing pressure from cheaper rivals like BYD in China.
    

        With Tesla's stock sinking nearly 50% this year, wiping out its post-election gains, the company could use a boost. Deliveries fell in February in several markets outside the US.
    

        Getting a more attainable price tag in front of cash-strapped shoppers could be just what Tesla needs to reinvigorate sales.
    

        ""Against this backdrop, accelerating the launch of more affordable vehicles has become more than just a tailwind but, rather, a key necessity for the company,"" Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com, told Business Insider. A cheaper model could also be an entry point into the Indian market, he said.
    

        Wedbush analyst and Tesla bull Dan Ives told BI that the lower-cost EV is a ""crucial new model to drive mass demand for Tesla that is missing a catalyst today.""
    

        ""There were many perceived headwinds for Musk and Tesla but it's all about new innovation and it starts this summer,"" Ives said.
    

        RBC Capital Markets analyst Tom Narayan said he spoke with the company a few weeks ago and heard that the plan is still to release the vehicle in the first half of 2025.
    

        Narayan said that it's also worth noting that Tesla expected to face some of the headwinds it's experiencing now.
    

        For example, Tesla said that its Model Y refresh would lead to several weeks of lost production as assembly lines are overhauled and production ramps up. The Model 3 and Model Y are now becoming older models and increasingly appearing in the used car market, Narayan said, and consumers may also be delaying new purchases in anticipation of a newer, cheaper model.
    

        Despite ongoing protests against Musk and Tesla, Narayan doesn't consider them to be a major factor as many car buyers simply want to buy a great product — regardless of the CEO.
    

        More important to the company is the slowing growth in the EV industry and greater competition in China, Investing.com's Monteiro said.
    

        While a lower-priced Tesla could boost car sales, Narayan said it might not completely reverse the stock downturn, adding that it's normal for the stock to fluctuate after a ""huge run."" He said the vehicle's design, and whether it launches on schedule will be key factors to watch.
    

        Monteiro said that Tesla's ""next growth cycle may not be in cheaper models,"" but in the next ""groundbreaking technological advancement for the industry"" — such as its upcoming robotaxi service.


        ""The bottom line is that the stakes are incredibly high for the company at this point,"" Monteiro said. ""Tesla has a history of delivering when the odds are stacked against it.""
    

        With Musk acknowledging on Monday that he's running his other businesses, including Tesla, with ""great difficulty"" amid his DOGE work, one thing seems clear.
    

        This is one deadline Wall Street doesn't want Musk to miss.

Ron Baron said his asset management firm Baron Capital sold Tesla shares last month after concerns that its position was becoming too large.

        ""Everyone, you know, has to deal with certain clientele,"" Baron said in a Tuesday interview with CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""And I deal with the critiques of my clientele for how large the positions are.""
    

        It's not the first time Baron Capital trimmed its Tesla stake. After selling about 1.8 million shares in March of 2021 after its assets were getting too big, the firm sold some of its shares again in the second quarter of 2024 for the same reason, Baron said.
    

        Baron, who serves as chairman and CEO of Baron Capital, said the firm sold about 5% more last month than it did in the second quarter. The firm now has around two-thirds of the Telsa stock it bought between 2014 and 2016, which was about $400 million, he added. The mutual fund manager said Tesla makes up about 12% of the firm's assets and SpaceX makes up about 9%.
    

        The move comes as Tesla has seen its shares plunge recently after a postelection surge that saw the stock hit an all-time high in December. Tesla sales declined across several European countries and China in February, according to vehicle registration data, and the share price has since wiped out the postelection gains, closing down over 15% on Monday.
    

        In recent weeks, protests and calls for a Tesla boycott have cropped up in response to Tesla CEO Elon Musk's political involvement, and police have investigated multiple incidents of vandalism at Tesla dealerships. 
    

        Baron said he sees the stock market's downturn as a potential positive. The longtime Tesla bull said he ""didn't sell any"" of his own shares in the company, and thinks the stock downturn is an opportunity for investors.
    

        ""I was thinking we would make four times over the next 10 years,"" Baron said about Tesla. ""I think we're gonna make more than that now from these prices.""
    

        While Baron said people may be ""unsettled"" at the stock market's recent fluctuation under Trump, he suggested what's happening in regard to the economy may be intentional and an effort to decrease inflation.
    

        ""In a year from now, things will look better,"" Baron said, adding that he ""can't believe how cheap"" the stock prices are.
    

        He also reiterated his support for Musk's leadership at Tesla, calling him an ""incredibly consequential person"" and ""unbelievable engineer,"" despite personally disagreeing with a CEO being so politically outspoken. He said he ""won't sell a single share personally"" until he's sold all Tesla shares for his clients.
    

        ""You wouldn't have a business without him, you wouldn't have EVs without him, you wouldn't have autonomous driving without him, you wouldn't have the internet on every inch of the planet without him, you wouldn't have rockets that you can use over without him,"" Baron said.

Tesla owners selling up amid backlash against Elon Musk should be prepared to take a big loss.

        Tesla resale values have collapsed in recent years, with the average price of a used Tesla now $10,000 less than that of a non-Tesla electric car, according to data from the dealership website CarGurus.
    

        Used Tesla prices have been in freefall since 2022, dropping from a high of more than $70,000 to hit $30,000 in February, per CarGurus data. In the shorter term, prices have dropped about 10% since August, when the average Tesla resale price was more than $33,000.
    

        The cheapest new Tesla on sale in 2025 is the Model 3, which costs more than $40,000 after estimated taxes and fees, according to Tesla's website.
    

        Fresh evidence of falling resale prices has come as CEO Elon Musk's cost-cutting efforts at the White House DOGE office have sparked a backlash against the billionaire's car company, with some owners vowing to get rid of their cars as Tesla showrooms and vehicles become targets for protests and vandalism.
    

        The singer Sheryl Crow said last month that she was selling her Tesla and donating the proceeds to NPR in a protest against Musk.
    

        The angel investor Joanne Wilson, meanwhile, told Business Insider she was ditching her Model S and floated the idea of letting members of the public smash it with hammers.
    

        Scott Oran, a real estate developer who lives near Boston, told BI he decided to sell his Model 3 after Musk's political moves left him ""embarrassed"" to be seen driving it.
    

        Oran said he wanted to sell his Tesla as quickly as possible, adding that he was concerned that the number of Tesla owners flocking to sell their cars and the high-profile vandalism cases could see the resale value drop even further.
    

        ""I think, unfortunately, through Elon Musk's actions, he's probably irrevocably damaged the Tesla brand,"" Oran said.
    

        Lackluster resale values have been a headache for Tesla owners for a while. The Tesla owner and investor Ross Gerber told BI he was struggling to sell his car at anything like fair market value last July.
    

        Used EVs have become more affordable as a growing number of new electric models have hit the market.
    

        Having led the way in selling EVs, Teslas are now by far the most common vehicle on the used electric market, per CarGurus' data. The rental giant Hertz listed more than 30,000 Tesla vehicles from its fleet for sale last year.
    

        Demand for used Teslas has also been hit by the company cutting prices on its brand-new models as it tries to drive sales.
    

Tesla's share price has plummeted in recent months, dropping more than 50% since December, having surged in the weeks after Donald Trump's election victory. On Monday alone, the stock dropped 15%, cutting Musk's net worth by $29 billion in a single day.
    

        With sales falling in Europe and China, the automaker is gearing up to introduce more affordable models this summer and is also planning to launch a robotaxi service in Austin in June.
    

        Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from BI.

16,2025-03-11,"The selloff on Tuesday extended losses suffered a day earlier.
U.S. stocks dropped on Tuesday, extending losses suffered a day earlier amid a fresh round of tariffs on Canada and concern about a possible recession.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down about 475 points, or 1.15%, while the S&P 500 fell 0.75%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq ticked down 0.15%.
The selloff on Tuesday extended a days-long market decline touched off by U.S. tariffs imposed last week on Canada, Mexico and China, some of which were delayed.
President Donald Trump on Tuesday announced retaliatory measures on Canada after Ontario slapped a 25% tariff on electricity sent to the U.S., saying that he is imposing an additional 25% tariff on steel and aluminum, bringing those tariffs to 50%.
Hours later, Ontario Premier Doug Ford issued a joint statement with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on X announcing the suspension of the 25% surcharge on electricity sent to the U.S.
The withdrawal of the surcharge came alongside an agreement to hold a meeting at the White House on Thursday to discuss a renewal of the trade agreement between the U.S. and Canada, the statement said.
The increased tariffs on steel and aluminum are still expected to go into effect on Wednesday as planned, White House spokesperson Kush Desai told ABC News Tuesday afternoon.
The tit for tat marked the latest in a global trade war that intensified a day earlier, when China slapped retaliatory tariffs on the U.S., deepening trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies.
On Monday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq plummeted 4%, recording its worst day of trading since 2022. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 each dropped more than 2% on Monday.
The market drawdown on Monday extended losses from last week. The S&P 500 recorded its worst week since September.
When asked about a potential recession in an interview broadcast on Sunday, Trump said tariffs imposed in recent days could bring about a ""period of transition.""
""I hate to predict things like that,"" Trump told Fox News in an interview recorded on Thursday. ""It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us.”
In response to a question later on Sunday about his reluctance to rule out a recession, Trump said: ""I tell you what, of course you hesitate. Who knows?""
The Bureau of Labor Statistics is expected Tuesday morning to release a report on how many jobs are open in the economy, which could provide another clue about the strength of economy amid the new recession concerns. An inflation report is expected Wednesday.

17,2025-03-11,"Tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 plunges 3.81 percent, its steepest single-day loss since September 2022.
The United States’ stock market has shed more than $1.7 trillion in value after US President Donald Trump declined to rule out the possibility the economy could enter a recession this year.
The benchmark S&P 500 on Monday tumbled 2.7 percent, dragging the index nearly 9 percent below its all-time high reached on February 19.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 plunged 3.81 percent, its steepest single-day loss since September 2022.
The losses, which follow two weeks of steep declines, mean that the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 are now at their lowest levels since September.
Tesla, the electric car company run by Trump’s cost-cutting tsar, Elon Musk, racked up some of the steepest losses among individual firms, plunging 15.43 percent.
Asian stock markets piled on the losses on Tuesday morning, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 and Taiwan’s TAIEX dropping more than 2.5 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng sliding about 1.5 percent.
The market rout comes as Trump’s back-and-forth tariff announcements have unnerved investors and stoked fears that the economy could be headed for a major slowdown or, at worst, a recession.
 

 
In an interview with Fox News that aired on Sunday, Trump left open the possibility of a downturn when asked if he expected a recession this year.
“I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big,” Trump said. “We’re bringing wealth back to America. That’s a big thing…It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us.”
 “There’s total uncertainty in the market,” Steve Okun, founder and CEO of APAC Advisors in Singapore, told Al Jazeera.
“[Trump] has no credibility right now when it comes to tariffs, because of what he has done, in particular with Mexico and Canada. That’s why the markets are reacting the way they are – they don’t know what’s going to happen. “
Trump last week slapped a 25 percent tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada and doubled the rate of duties on Chinese goods to 20 percent, only to announce two days later that he would postpone some duties on Mexican and Canadian goods until April 2.
A separate 25 percent tariff on imports of steel and aluminium is set to take effect on Wednesday.
Goldman Sachs economists last week raised its odds of a recession within the next 12 months from 15 percent to 20 percent, while JPMorgan Chase has lifted the probability from 30 percent to 40 percent “owing to extreme US policies”.
New York Stock Exchange trader Peter Tuchman described Monday’s trading session as a “bloodbath”.
“These stocks are being eaten away and this is obviously all over fear of a recession, right?” Tuchman said in a video posted on X.
“We had a roller coaster last week, we had some up days, we had some down days – and all a function of what is coming out of the Oval Office, which is just complete indecisiveness, confusion and mixed messaging and the investing community losing confidence in the whole situation.”
Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, who represents the state of Massachusetts, accused Trump of jeopardising the economy with his policies.
“We’re in real economic trouble thanks to the President, and right now, the stock market is a flashing warning light,” Warren said on X.
In a rare note of dissension with Trump among Republicans, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul also raised alarm about the stock rout.
“The stock market is comprised of millions of people who are simultaneously trading,” Paul said on X.
“The market indexes are a distillation of sentiment. When the markets tumble like this in response to tariffs, it pays to listen.”
In an interview with CNBC on Monday, Kevin Hassett, the head of Trump’s National Economic Council, played down concerns about the health of the economy as “blips in the data”.
“What I think that what’s going to happen is the first quarter is going to squeak into the positive category, and then the second quarter is going to take off as everybody sees the reality of the tax cuts,” Hassett said.

Lego has increased its market share and has seen its revenue surge as other toymakers struggle to make headway.

        The Danish firm, famous for its colorful plastic bricks, reported revenue growth of 13% to DKK 74.3 billion ($10.85 billion) in 2024. 
    

        This was led by strong demand in the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East. In the Americas, sales rose by almost 16% compared to 2023, the company said in its annual report.
    

        ""Throughout the year, we continued to leverage our portfolio — around half of which was new — to grow with fans of all ages and interests,"" Lego CEO Niels B.Christiansen said in a letter. 
    

        ""While kids will always be our main focus, we saw increased demand among teenagers and adults with our Lego Botanical Collection which attracted new builders to the Lego brand.""
    

        While the toy market is in decline, some of that struggle has been offset by a growing trend of young adults and teenagers buying stuffed animals and other toys for themselves.
    

        A report by the market research company Circana found that people of 18 and over accounted for toy sales worth more than $1.5 billion in the last quarter of 2024, outpacing purchases made for children of three to five.
    

        Lego, in particular, has cashed in on this trend, with a growing group of consumers, often referred to as AFOLs, or adult fans of Lego, helping to grow sales.
    

        While Lego sales jump, rivals are stuttering. Mattel, the maker of Barbie, said net sales were down 1% in 2024 versus the previous year. Hasbro, which sells products like Nerf guns, Monopoly, and Play-Doh, reported a revenue decline of 18% compared to 2023.
    

        Some best-selling themes for Lego were Star Wars and Harry Potter — both of which are popular among adult users.

Tesla stock took a beating on Monday, plummeting more than 15 percent in its worst single-day performance in years, a sell-off precipitated by both a market downturn and a rising tide of resentment over CEO Elon Musk‘s gleeful destruction of federal government agencies. But Donald Trump is looking out for his highest-spending megadonor, and after Musk’s net worth dropped $23 billion in a matter of hours, the president took aim at the Tesla Takedown protest movement that has brought tens of thousands of people out to picket his electric vehicle dealerships in recent weeks. 

	“Radical Left Lunatics, as they often do, are trying to illegally and collusively boycott Tesla, one of the World’s great automakers, and Elon’s ‘baby,’ in order to attack and do harm to Elon, and everything he stands for,” Trump fumed on his social media platform late Monday evening. “I’m going to buy a brand new Tesla tomorrow morning as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American.”

	










	In a display of textbook corruption that would have seemed outrageous during any administration in living memory but feels like business as usual with Trump, the president today had several Tesla models lined up in the White House driveway for a photo op, including the steel-paneled Cybertruck. He and Musk took turns hyping up the brand, with Trump even referring to a printout of a Tesla sales pitch, complete with pricing. At one point he sat in the driver’s seat of a red Model S and marveled at its dashboard screen. “This is a different panel than I’ve ever — everything’s computer!” he said. Speaking to reporters, he claimed that Tesla is “as good as it gets” among automakers, and that Musk “has been treated very unfairly” by citizens voicing their opposition to his power as an unelected bureaucrat.

	Trump ultimately said he would write a check for the Model S, which starts at $79,990, but noted that as president he’s not permitted to drive and hasn’t in many years. Instead, he suggested that he would keep the new Tesla on the property for staff to use. “I’m not allowed to use it, can you believe it?” he remarked. In between answering questions about the Russia-Ukraine war and the administration’s attempts to deport Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist and legal U.S. resident, Trump poured on the praise for Musk, saying: “We have to celebrate somebody that has the courage to do this. He could’ve said, ‘I’m not doing anything, I’m not going to get involved, let the country go to hell.’ He didn’t want to do that.” This comment seemed to refer both to Musk using about a quarter of a billion dollars to help reelect the president and his role as de facto head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), whose slapdash cuts to administrative institutions have left thousands jobless and unleashed popular contempt for him and his companies.

	That disdain has been escalating, in no small part because of Musk’s extremist far-right ideology. While Tesla Takedown is a peaceful movement, Tesla cars, chargers, and properties around the world have become targets for petty vandalism, as well as alleged arsons and gunfire. Asked whether he would label individuals who carry out such attacks “domestic terrorists,” Trump replied: “I will do that. I’ll do it. I going to stop them. We catch anybody doing it — because they’re harming a great American company.” It’s not clear whether the administration has taken steps to enforce this classification of such crimes, nor how it could.

	Musk used the event to made an announcement that, like the stunt of turning the White House driveway into a Tesla lot, seemed designed to juice Tesla stock. “As a function of the great policies of President Trump and his administration, and as an act of faith in America, Tesla is going to double vehicle output in the United States within the next two years,” he vowed. Musk has a long history of failing to deliver on splashy promises and milestone deadlines even as he benefits from media coverage of them.

	Tesla shares saw a modest bump today, ticking up slightly less than four percent by the close of trading to recover a fraction of Monday’s losses. The effects of the stock rally that followed Trump’s election victory have been completely wiped out since he and Musk came to power.

	Nevertheless, Trump and Musk appear to remain committed to an alliance as head of state and tech oligarch. On the subject of a potential “end date” for Musk’s involvement in government, Trump kept it vague: “I think I’ll know when it’s time,” he said. “I’ll stay as long as it’s useful and productive,” Musk added. And, presumably, as long as he has the use of the White House for marketing stunts.

20,2025-03-11,"Seven weeks into his term, concerns are growing about a possible recession.
Then-candidate Donald Trump, at a campaign rally last August as the 2024 race for the White House was heating up, made a promise to voters to quickly bring economic relief if elected.
""Starting on Day 1, we will end inflation and make America affordable again,"" he said at a rally in Montana, where he told supporters: ""This election is about saving our economy.""
A week later, he made a show of displaying cartons of eggs, bacon, milk and other grocery products outside his New Jersey golf course as he railed against the Biden administration's policies.
""When I win, I will immediately bring prices down,"" Trump said at the time.
Trump started to change his tune not long after his victory, however, saying in an interview with Time magazine, published in December, that bringing down food costs will be ""very hard.""
Now, seven weeks into his administration, Trump's tariff policies are roiling the markets and fears of a recession are growing.
During his first major speech to Congress and the nation since his inauguration, Trump last week defended his imposition of steep levies on key U.S. trading partners like Canada, China and Mexico.
""Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again. And it's happening, and it will happen rather quickly. There will be a little disturbance, but we're okay with that. It won't be much,"" he said.
Since then, his back-and-forth on tariffs for Canada and Mexico caused a stock market meltdown, with the S&P 500 recording its worst week since last September.
During an interview on Fox News ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" Trump was asked if he is expecting a recession this year after the Atlanta Federal Reserve projected negative GDP growth for the first quarter of 2025.
""I hate to predict things like that,"" Trump responded. ""There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big. We're bringing wealth back to America. That's a big thing, and there are always periods of, it takes a little time. It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us.""
He was pressed on his hesitation to strike down the possibility later Sunday as he spoke with reporters on Air Force One.
""I’ll tell you what, of course you hesitate. Who knows? All I know is this: We’re going to take in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs, and we’re going to become so rich, you’re not going to know where to spend all that money,"" he said. ""I’m telling you, you just watch. We’re going to have jobs. We’re going to have open factories. It’s going to be great.""
Stock losses continued Monday and Tuesday after Trump's comments. More tariffs are being implemented against steel and aluminum products on Wednesday, and Trump's pledging to move forward with ""reciprocal"" tariffs starting on April 2.
On Tuesday afternoon, Trump amended his answer on recession concerns as he looked at Tesla vehicles at the White House, where he took questions from reporters for first time since his Sunday remarks.
ABC News White House Correspondent Karen Travers asked Trump directly, ""Do you think there will be a recession?""
""I don’t see it at all. I think this country is going to boom,"" Trump responded. ""But as I said, I can do it the easy way or the hard way. The hard way to do it is exactly what I'm doing. But the results are going to be 20 times greater.""
The White House earlier Tuesday sought to cast the market turmoil as a ""snapshot of a moment in time"" before Trump's policies bear their intended impact.
""We are in a period of economic transition,"" press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters when asked directly if she could reassure Americans there wouldn't be a downturn.
Leavitt blamed the Biden administration for what she said was an ""economic disaster"" left to Trump -- despite Biden overseeing a soft economic landing -- and pointed to other indicators she said were positive signs for Americans, including a boost in manufacturing jobs last month and reports of companies looking to expand operations in America.
""The American people, CEOs, and people on Wall Street and on Main Street should bet on this president,"" Leavitt told reporters. ""He is a dealmaker. He is a businessman and he's doing what's right for our country.""

21,2025-03-11,"Donald Trump has downplayed the stock market volatility which followed flip-flops over his trade policies.
United States stock markets plummeted on Monday amid fears that President Donald Trump’s tariff policies might drive the world’s largest economy into recession. After years of impressive growth, America’s economic exceptionalism has been called into question.
Concern over an economic downturn has driven a stock market rout that wiped $1.7 trillion from the S&P 500 – the world’s most-watched equity index. It fell by 2.7 percent, dragging it 9 percent below the all-time high it reached on February 19.




The tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 posted its worst day since 2022, wiping out more than $1 trillion in value. Investors sold shares in the so-called “magnificent seven” – Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla.
The market selloff comes as Trump’s back-and-forth tariff announcements have unnerved investors and stoked fears that the US economy could be headed for a major slowdown, or even a recession.
Last week, Trump slapped a 25 percent tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada and doubled the rate on Chinese goods to 20 percent, only to announce two days later that he would delay some Mexican and Canadian tariff hikes until April 2.
Trump has also threatened to impose a global regime of reciprocal tariffs: every country will face the same levy it chooses to impose on US goods from April 2. A 25 percent tariff on imports of steel and aluminium is also set to take effect on Wednesday.
Tariffs look set to increase inflation and consumers will bear the brunt of the higher costs. Many Americans could be forced to tighten their belts, which would lower growth and raise unemployment.
Ongoing public sector cuts and geopolitical tensions have also amplified US policy volatility. On CNBC, Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, described Trump as an “agent of chaos and confusion”.
“What is coming out of the Oval Office … is just complete indecisiveness, confusion and mixed messaging and the investing community losing confidence,” Peter Tuchman, a stock exchange trader, said in a video posted on X.
In an interview with Fox News that aired on Sunday, Trump suggested that the risk of an economic downturn – if it were to happen – would be worth it in the cause of the broader economic shifts he is trying to engineer.
“I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we’re doing is very big,” Trump said. “We’re bringing wealth back to America. That’s a big thing … It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us.”
Asked whether he thought tariffs on US imports would increase inflation, he said, “You may get it. In the meantime, guess what? Interest rates are down.”
He also doubled down on his trade protectionist agenda, saying, “We [the US] have been ripped off at levels never seen before, and we’re going to get a lot of it back.”
As Wall Street panicked yesterday, the White House maintained an optimistic outlook, pointing to major investment pledges from corporate leaders.
White House spokesperson Kush Desai said on Monday that CEOs had responded to Trump’s “America First” agenda, which is marked by tariffs and deregulation, by pledging “trillions in investment commitments.” These commitments, he said, “will create thousands of new jobs”.
Meanwhile, in an interview with CNBC on Monday, Kevin Hassett, the head of Trump’s National Economic Council, played down financial market wobbles as “blips in the data”.
Howard Lutnick, Trump’s commerce secretary, told NBC’s Meet the Press: “There’s going to be no recession in America … you are going to see over the next two years the greatest set of growth coming from America,” Lutnick said.
Asian stocks fell sharply on Tuesday morning, as the previous day’s US market selloff extended globally. Japan’s Nikkei stocks slid about 3 percent, hitting their lowest level since September.
Chinese stocks were also not immune to the downbeat mood. The blue-chip index fell 0.5 percent, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was 0.8 percent lower. Australia’s benchmark index also dropped by 0.8 percent.
 

 
Safe haven assets – which investors flock to in periods of market uncertainty – are now in demand, with the Japanese yen touching a five-month high against the dollar, at 147.07 per dollar. The Swiss franc has also strengthened. Both currencies are considered stable due to their predictable economic backdrops and low inflation environments.
Gold, long considered financially secure, inched up to $2,895.75 per ounce, within touching distance of the record high it hit last month. Gold is now up 10 percent so far in 2025, after climbing 27 percent last year.
Oil prices, which typically move in tandem with global gross domestic product, fell for a second day on Tuesday. Brent futures, the global benchmark, dropped by 0.65 percent to $68.83 a barrel.
Unlike Trump’s first term, when cracks in the economy or stock market wobbles often led to policy pivots, the US president seems determined to follow through on restrictive trade arrangements this time around.
In turn, Citi analysts cut their recommendation for US stocks to “neutral” from “overweight”, arguing the US economy may no longer outpace the rest of the world in the coming months.
Goldman Sachs economists last week raised its odds of a recession within the next 12 months from 15 percent to 20 percent, while JPMorganChase has lifted the probability from 30 percent to 40 percent “owing to extreme US policies”.
The yield (or rate of return) on a two-year US government bond, which moves in step with interest rate expectations, fell 0.05 percent yesterday to a five-month low. As such, many expect the US Federal Reserve to lower borrowing costs.
The Fed’s benchmark rate currently sits at about 4.3 percent, which is high by recent historical standards.
Traders are now pricing in a 0.85 percent cut in interest rates from the Fed this year, compared with 0.75 percent basis points on Monday, according to the London Stock Exchange Group. Lower borrowing costs are designed to help spur growth in a slowing economy.
Prashant Newnaha, a senior Asia Pacific rates strategist at TD Securities, told the Reuters news agency that “markets have now gotten the memo that the administration is intent on ripping the band-aid off”.
Since his first day in office, Trump has stated his desire to tame US inflation. At the same time, he’s made trade tariffs central to his presidency. He’s unlikely to achieve both policy aims at the same time.
“Recession may be the medicine to create disinflation … for now it’s a controlled demolition,” Newnaha said.

25,2025-03-11,"The adage goes, “your arbitrage is my opportunity,” and could be used to sum up Meta’s push into building an in-house chip for AI training tasks. Reuters reports the company recently began a small deployment of the chips after successfully building them in a test with Taiwan’s TSMC (sorry Intel). Meta is already using its chips for inference or tailoring content to specific users after the AI model has already been developed and trained. It wants to use them for training models by 2026.
From the article:
The push to develop in-house chips is part of a long-term plan at Meta to bring down its mammoth infrastructure costs as the company places expensive bets on AI tools to drive growth.
Meta, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, has forecast total 2025 expenses of $114 billion to $119 billion, including up to $65 billion in capital expenditure largely driven by spending on AI infrastructure.
Even if consumer applications of generative AI, like chatbots, end up being an overhyped bubble, Meta can deploy the technology to improve content recommendations and ad targeting. The vast majority of Meta’s revenue comes from advertising, and even small improvements in targeting capabilities can produce billions of dollars in new revenue as advertisers see better results.
Despite some flops and lackluster results from the Reality Labs division, Meta has managed to build out strong hardware teams over the years and has seen some success with its Ray-Ban AI glasses. However, executives have warned teams internally that their hardware efforts still have not had the world-changing impact they are hoping for. Meta’s VR headsets sell in the low millions annually. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has long sought to build out its own hardware platforms so it can reduce its reliance on Apple and Google.
Major tech companies have paid billions of dollars to Nvidia since 2022 in order to stock up on its much sought-after GPUs that have become the industry standard for AI processing. While the company has some competitors, like AMD, Nvidia has been lauded for offering not just chips themselves but the CUDA software toolkit for developing AI applications on them.
Late last year, Nvidia reported that nearly 50% of its revenue in one quarter came from just four companies. All of these companies have sought to build chips so they can cut out the middleman and drive down costs, and they can wait many years for a return. There is only so long that investors will tolerate heavy spending before they demand that Meta show it is paying off. Amazon has its own Inferentia chips, while Google has been developing the Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) for years.
Nvidia’s concentration in just a few customers that are building their own processors, along with the rise of efficient AI models like China’s DeepSeek, have raised some concerns about whether Nvidia can keep up its growth forever, though CEO Jensen Huang has said he is optimistic that data center providers will spend $1 trillion over the next five years building out infrastructure, which could see his company continue to grow into the 2030s. And, of course, most companies will not be able to develop chips like Meta can.

28,2025-03-11,"Today marks the 20th anniversary of Y Combinator, a startup accelerator that has fostered companies that have changed the world. YC has brought us innovations like âmaking everything an appâ and horrifying founders we all have to live with, like âSam Altman.â
Founded in 2005, Y Combinator has helped to launch thousands of companies. Its mere existence disrupted how venture capital-backed technology firms do business. We all live with the consequences. Here are some of them.
A taxi for your burrito. Thatâs the pitch. Founded in 2013, the company promised to improve food delivery for everyone. It ushered in an era where anyone could get delivery from any restaurant at any time.
To make that happen, it brutalized delivery drivers, ripped off restaurants, and raised prices on its customers. Itâs a bad deal for everyone involved except, of course, DoorDash. All so you can get cold food from a chain restaurant at double what you would have paid if youâd just gone and eaten it there.
Airbnbâs disruption of the hotel industry is so far-reaching that itâs spawned a new subgenre of horror fiction. Airbnb fits a Silicon Valley template that will be repeated throughout Y Combinatorâs history. Take a solved problem and disrupt it so you can make a mint rent-seeking.
Over thousands of years, humans had developed customs, laws, and systems for providing travelers and visitors safe lodging. Airbnb said, âWhat if you could make your home a timeshare and skip all those pesky norms and laws?â
The result? A corrosive hit to the U.S. real estate market, TikTok videos in which the host is living in the walls of the Airbnb, and the movie Barbarian.
What if you could play video games with your friends, but like, as a job? Say hello to Twitch, a place where some of the worst personalities on the internet would eventually gather and develop parasocial relationships and wage war with reality around them.
Itâs hard to make money on Twitch; only a small percentage of people break through. But if you do, you can look forward to working 10 hours straight without using the bathroom, getting banned by a capricious Amazon-owned company, fighting audience capture, and wrecking your physical health.
OpenAI founder and AI evangelist worked for YC from 2011 to 2019 before he left to run OpenAI full time. Altman was president of YC starting in 2014, and his tenure saw explosive growth at the company.
Now we see his pinched little face every time we open up a news story about AI and live in a world where large language models like ChatGPT are helping kids cheat on their homework and writing your boss’s PowerPoint Slides.
We have not even begun to reckon with Sam Altman and his consequences for the human race.
In 2011, Marc Andreeseen declared that âsoftware is eating the world.â He was right. We live in a world filled with unnecessary intercessions between us and basic tasks. It seems you canât buy basic goods and services these days without downloading an app to support them.
Did you buy new lights on Amazon? They run on an app. Want to get a new car? Gonna have to get an app to make it run. Wanna grab brunch on a Sunday? Better use the restaurantâs app to reserve a table. Wanna browse the menu before you go? App.
Why is this happening? In part, because the world saw the success of companies like Instacart, DoorDash, and other YC-backed ventures. Software and apps were a great way to create new middlemen. Some of them offered new services, but a lot of them just figured out a way to charge for stuff that once was simple and cheap, if not free.
If your buddy sends you a meme that hasnât been funny in 10 years and it doesnât have an âifunny.coâ watermark on it, then it probably came from 9gag. This website is where jokes, memes, and videos from last yearâs Reddit threads go to die. Y Combinator funded it.
Speaking of Reddit â¦
Look, we all love Reddit. Yes, itâs been the birthplace for some horrible things. But itâs also one of the only places you can go to get real answers to burning questions. Adding âRedditâ at the end of a Google search query is one of the only ways to find stuff on the internet now.
However, Reddit has birthed weird cultural trends we all have to contend with. Worst among them â¦
If Y Combinator had never backed Reddit we wouldnât have Malcolm and Simone Collins, the pro-natalist weirdos who go viral every few years. (Most recently in The New Yorker) Where did they get their start? Reddit. Malcolm proposed to Simone on Reddit using âadvice animalâ memes. Then he wrote about it for The Huffington Post.
A lot of people have Malcoms and Simones in their real life. People who are too online and spend so much time on Reddit they canât hold a conversation without bringing up bacon, narwhals, or the disappointing contents of an ancient safe.
Selling Silicon Valley to the rest of the world requires keen marketing. To get people to buy a new app, a new piece of software, or a new âinnovationâ requires a good story. It requires hype. YC is a machine that builds hype. To be incubated by the startup machine is a story itself and being chosen by YC is enough to make audiences, and the market, pay attention.
Sure, most of these ventures fail. Bubbles burst. But a lot of people will make a lot of money while itâs inflating. See: YC Alum Sam Altman.
Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Elon Musk. Founders. Mythological figures that stride through Americaâs consciousness bending the world to their will. YC has incubated more than just companies, itâs incubated founders. If you’re a CEO picked by YC and youâre savvy enough, you can become a celebrity in your own right and use that to parlay into the next thing if your company fails.
And itâll probably fail.
YC has a whole âfounders directoryâ that will let you sort through the famous faces who have passed through its doors. Sure, companies are collaborative enterprises that require massive amounts of talented and hardworking people cooperating to succeed. But in todayâs social media and celebrity-driven world, itâs the âfaceâ of the company that matters. Over the past 20 years, YC has helped founders become that face.
Last year, Y Combinator founder Paul Graham went viral with his essay titled “Founder Mode,” which detailed the power of founders not listening to the beaurocrats around them and going with their gut.
Those founders now think they’re the center of the universe. Backed by VC money and plumped up by parasocial online relationships and an army of yes-men, founders are doing some of the worst work in America today.
Some people think the tech press is too easy on tech. âFoundersâ and YC think itâs too hard. The beef between the YC-backed founder community and journalists is long, fraught, and complicated. YC founder Paul Graham signed a petition that chastised The New York Times in 2020.
When the Wall Street Journal outed Theranos as a fraud, then-YC president Altman rushed to her defense on Twitter. âSlam pieces tell one side of a story. I do think Theranos should be more transparent, but ppl shouldn’t pray for failure.â
Former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan gave a speech at a YC event in 2013 that ruffled journalists’ feathers. Later, Srinivasan sent an email to tech-right weirdo and Peter Thiel court wizard Curtis Yarvan advocating for the harassment of a journalist to set an example. âIf things get hot, it may be interesting to sic the Dark Enlightenment audience on a single vulnerable hostile reporter to dox them and turn them inside out with hostile reporting sent to their advertisers/friends/contacts,â he said in the email.
YC and its founder culture fostered the ideology we now live with, one thatâs hostile to journalists. One where a tech-bro is rampaging through the federal government.
All your worst tech-brained friends saw the possibilities of cryptocurrency when Bitcoin launched in 2009. The problem was making it easy for normies to get their money into the system. Enter Coinbase, the YC-backed company that helps people trade crypto of all types in just a few minutes.
Do you remember NFTs? The blockchain-backed JPGs were all the rage among a certain kind of terminally online person just a few years ago. The bottom dropped out sometime around when Paris Hilton told Jimmy Fallon sheâd bought a Bored Ape.
YC-backed OpenSea was a place where people could buy, sell, and trade all their favorite ugly JPGs and helped make the trend accessible to normies. Then, the whole market collapsed.
No one likes their Homeowners Association. HOAâs are draconian nightmares that sick the cops on people who havenât cut their lawns. They levy fees and punish people in communities who donât conform to often arbitrary standards.
What if you added AI to that process? Say hello to Assembly HOA, a YC-backed startup that promises to make running an HOA transparent and efficient.
Largely forgotten now, OMGPop was a flash game studio that was gobbled up by Zynga in 2013. The bigger company ate its games and then shut OMGPop down just months after buying it.
OMGPop was a pioneer of the flashy, fun, and addictive quick and simple games that would come to dominate the mobile video game market. Six years after its closure, hackers uncovered millions of plaintext passwords and email addresses related to OMGPop in a Zynga database and exposed them online proving that your favorite game may vanish but the personal data it housed will live forever in an unsecure corporate database.
uBiome is the Showtime to Theranosâ HBO. Elizabeth Holmes promised fast and safe blood tests. uBiome promised safe and fast poop tests. The promise of extracting data from stool samples was powerful enough for YC and other investors to invest $83 million.
But uBiomeâs founders were lying and the FBI raided its labs in 2019. Two years later the SEC charged its co-founders with defrauding investors.
The ultimate goal of Tesla and Uber is the self-driving car. Silicon Valley dreams of a world where automated cars cruise up and down Americaâs highways. YC-backed Cruise was one of the first companies to pitch this dream to the world.
Itâs not working out at the moment. There have been a lot of self-driving car accidents, and itâs hard to know if the technology will ever be safe and widely available to the public. Tesla, Uber, and others keep hoping and pushing for us to let go and let tech take the wheel.
GM gobbled up Cruise in 2016. It began the process of shutting down in 2025.
Y Combinator isnât done fostering innovation. Tomorrowâs Twitch.com, DoorDash, or OMGPop is waiting somewhere on the list of companies itâs backing. Letâs take a look at some upcoming contenders.
America has a long and strange history of Christian revival movements. This country loves to shape the word of the Lord to its own ends. Last year, billionaire ghoul Peter Thiel gave a âsermonâ at a meeting of a nonprofit called the Acts 17 Collective. Y Combinator’s newest CEO, Garry Tan, was there to lead the discussion as well. The group is putting millions into spreading the tech-tinged Gospel throughout San Francisco. A spiritual and religious revival in the Bay Area? These things have never goneÂ wrong before.
What does the future hold for Y Combinator? Missiles. In the summer of 2024, the startup accelerator backed its first defense company. Ares plans to build low-cost cruise missiles for the DoD.
Another new venture fostered by Y Combinator is Optifye.ai, a company that will provide âAI performance monitoring for factory workers.â The bold new company will use AI and surveillance to watch factory workers and allow the boss to yell at them remotely from the comfort of their home office.

        Trump made the announcement on Tuesday at the White House, as Tesla's stock came tumbling more than 50% from recent highs.
    

        ""They're bad guys. They're the same guys who screw around with our schools and universities,"" Trump said. ""We're gonna catch you, and you're gonna go through hell.""
    

        Spokespeople for the White House and Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

Donald Trump says he's buying a Tesla.

        The President wrote in a post on Truth Social early Tuesday morning that he wants to purchase the electric vehicle a as a show of support for his right-hand-man, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk.
    

        ""To Republicans, Conservatives, and all great Americans, Elon Musk is 'putting it on the line' in order to help our Nation, and he is doing a FANTASTIC JOB!"" Trump wrote. ""But the Radical Left Lunatics, as they often do, are trying to illegally and collusively boycott Tesla, one of the World's great automakers, and Elon's 'baby,' in order to attack and do harm to Elon, and everything he stands for.""
    

        Trump continued, ""I'm going to buy a brand new Tesla tomorrow morning as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American.""
    

Tesla has been struggling since its CEO became the de-facto leader of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which has worked quickly since Trump's inauguration to slash the federal workforce and reduce government spending.
    

Tesla's stock has plunged 55% from its record high in mid-December, and so far this year, it's down more than 40%. Protests — some featuring Mariachi bands, raccoon puppets, and cardboard Cybertrucks — have been cropping up at Tesla showrooms across the country as public ire over Musk's role in the Trump administration grows. And some Tesla owners are trying to offload their vehicles because of the backlash to Musk, though they'll have to be ready to take a big loss.
    

        Boycotting a company is not illegal, as Trump claimed in his post. The First Amendment protects citizens' right to protest against businesses, the Supreme Court ruled in 1982.
    

        Musk told Fox Business's Larry Kudlow that he's been running his businesses like Tesla and SpaceX ""with great difficulty"" since he started working with the White House
    

Tesla's investors have also grown worried that Musk is spending too much time on DOGE.
    

        The White House, Tesla, and Elon Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

32,2025-03-11,"President Trump’s spite for our neighbors is driving the economy to the edge of recession.
The stock market plummeted after Trump announced Tuesday the doubling of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, from 25 percent to 50 percent, with more on the way very soon.
“Based on Ontario, Canada, placing a 25% Tariff on ‘Electricity’ coming into the United States, I have instructed my Secretary of Commerce to add an ADDITIONAL 25% Tariff, to 50%, on all STEEL and ALUMINUM COMING INTO THE UNITED STATES FROM CANADA, ONE OF THE HIGHEST TARIFFING NATIONS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. This will go into effect TOMORROW MORNING, March 12th,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.”
These actions have led to intense uncertainty. Monday was the worst day for Nasdaq in over two years, and on Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by nearly 1 percent.
Trump has tried to get out in front of this by using language intended to ease people into the fact that the stock market (and the economy) is going to look absolutely horrendous for a very long time.
“I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big. We’re bringing wealth back to America, that’s a big thing. And there are always periods of.… It takes a little time, it takes a little time. But I think it should be great for us,” he said on Sunday when asked if he was expecting a recession this year. “Look, what I have to do is build a strong country. You can’t really watch the stock market.”
On Truth Social, Trump again stated that the only way for this tariff war to end would be for Canada to somehow become the fifty-first state.
“We are subsidizing Canada to the tune of more than 200 Billion Dollars a year. WHY??? This cannot continue. The only thing that makes sense is for Canada to become our cherished Fifty First State. This would make all Tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear.”
Trump has also placed 25 percent tariffs on goods from Mexico and 10 percent tariffs on goods from China. 
Democrats are losing trust in battleground districts and struggling to connect with independent voters. 
That is what new internal polling conducted by the Democratic group Navigator Research says about the party, which doesn’t bode well for next year’s midterm elections. In contested House districts, most voters believe that Democrats in Congress are “more focused on helping other people than people like me.” 
Only 27 percent of independent voters in such districts believe that Democrats are focused on helping them, versus 55 percent who say they focus on others. The full findings of the poll, one of the first of battleground congressional districts since November, will be presented to House Democrats and their staff on Wednesday at their Issues Conference in Leesburg, Virginia.
The conference is supposed to help coordinate House Democrats’ messaging heading into the 2026 midterm elections, and if the results are any indication, the party needs to figure things out—and fast. 
“The Democratic brand is still not where it needs to be in terms of core trust and understanding people’s challenges,” said Molly Murphy, one of the pollsters. “Even though voters are critical about Trump and some of the things he’s doing, that criticism of Trump doesn’t translate into trust in Democrats. The trust has to be earned.”
One major area that Democrats lack trust is regarding jobs and work. Only 44 percent of polled voters think that Democrats respect work, while just 39 percent think that Democrats value work. A majority of voters, 56 percent to be exact, say that they don’t believe Democrats are looking out for working people, while just 42 percent think that Democrats share their values. And only 39 percent of voters think Democrats have the right priorities. 
The party has an uphill battle over the next year, as 69 percent of voters said Democrats were “too focused on being politically correct” and 51 percent said “elitist” was a good descriptor for Democrats. The party has to put together a coherent message that can reach the working people necessary to regain control of Congress, all the more necessary with the damage Donald Trump is doing to the economy and the federal government. 
The question is whether the party can come up with an effective strategy that fires up the base and brings in new voters instead of weak stunts and the out-of-touch strategies touted by centrist groups like Third Way. If they don’t, not only will they lose again, but Trump and the GOP will continue to run roughshod over the country. 
Donald Trump’s 2025 inaugural entourage was noticeably flush, with several of the world’s richest people—including Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Sergey Brin, Bernard Arnault, and Jeff Bezos—standing behind the president as he was sworn in. 
But seven weeks later, that cohort has lost a significant sum of cash, with the five billionaires’ collective net worths tanking by a staggering $209 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
Any momentary market gains boosted by Trump’s return to the Oval Office have since vanished. The S&P 500 has lost 6.4 percent since the inauguration, largely thanks to Trump’s whiplash tariff proposals and a mass layoff sweeping the federal government under Musk’s direction.
Musk’s losses stem from a downturn on Tesla, which historically attracted a more liberal consumer base with its electric vehicles. That same base has since soured on the tech billionaire and his products, especially in some of Europe’s stronger economies, such as Germany, which has seen sales in the country fall by more than 70 percent over the last two months, reported Bloomberg. Sales in China—where Tesla has two major factories—have similarly plummeted, falling by 49 percent in February.
Bezos’s financial woes follow his decisions to support Trump’s inauguration fund in December and his increasingly tight grip on The Washington Post, which he announced would now prioritize personal liberties and free markets in its Opinions section. Amazon shares have fallen 14 percent since January 17, according to Bloomberg, which noted that Bezos dined with the president as recently as last month.
On Monday, Trump floated that the “little disruption” caused by his aggressive trade policies could go on for quite a bit longer, urging Americans to come up with a totally new calendar to measure how long they’ll be affected.
“Look, what I have to do is build a strong country,” the president told Fox Business, responding to criticism about the recent stock market drop. “You can’t really watch the stock market. If you look at China, they have a 100-year perspective. We have a quarter. We go by quarters. And you can’t go by that.”
Trump is scheduled to address U.S. business leaders Tuesday at a Business Roundtable meeting at 5 p.m.
A Justice Department official says she was fired for not letting convicted domestic abuser Mel Gibson have a gun, according to The New York Times.
Pardon attorney Liz Oyer told the Times that two weeks ago she was placed on a team working to restore gun rights to individuals with criminal convictions, as many on the right argue that the ban is too restrictive and not specific enough toward each case. Oyer did the work, culling 95 eligible candidates down to nine, and turned her list in. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told her to add one more name to the list: Mel Gibson. 
“They sent it back to me saying, ‘We would like you to add Mel Gibson to this memo,’” she said. She also noted a letter from Gibson’s lawyer to acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove that noted Donald Trump’s recent appointment of Gibson as a “Hollywood ambassador,” as well as his general fame.  
Federal law prohibits people convicted of crimes like misdemeanor state domestic violence from buying or owning a handgun.
“Giving guns back to domestic abusers is a serious matter that, in my view, is not something that I could recommend lightly, because there are real consequences that flow from people who have a history of domestic violence being in possession of firearms,” Oyer said.
Oyer was also aware of the antisemitic outburst Gibson allegedly spewed toward a cop who pulled him over for a suspected DUI in 2006. Gibson denies he used any discriminatory language. 
Oyer refused to add Gibson to the list, and was then asked if her position was “flexible.” She said it was not. 
“He then essentially explained to me that Mel Gibson has a personal relationship with President Trump and that should be sufficient basis for me to make a recommendation and that I would be wise to make the recommendation,” she said. “I literally did not sleep a wink that night because I understood that the position I was in was one that was going to either require me to compromise my strongly held views and ethics or would likely result in me losing my ability to participate in these conversations going forward.”
The next morning, Oyer was called to her office and met with security guards instructing her to leave the premises. She was fired for upholding her principles instead of doing a skeevy favor for one of the president’s buddies. 
There has been no update from the Justice Department on the gun rights restoration list. 
Elon Musk took such a massive financial hit Monday that his friend President Donald Trump is now moonlighting as a car salesman.
Tesla stock plummeted 15 percent, drying up the very last drops of Musk’s postelection gains and costing him a whopping $29 billion. In a post on Truth Social within the first hour of Tuesday, the president rushed to defend the bouncing billionaire head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, claiming that he was the victim of an illegal “boycott.”
“To Republicans, Conservatives, and all great Americans, Elon Musk is ‘putting it on the line’ in order to help our Nation, and he is doing a FANTASTIC JOB!” Trump gushed.  
“But the Radical Left Lunatics, as they often do, are trying to illegally and collusively boycott Tesla, one of the World’s great automakers, and Elon’s ‘baby,’ in order to attack and do harm to Elon, and everything he stands for. They tried to do it to me at the 2024 Presidential Ballot Box, but how did that work out?” Trump wrote, pivoting back to his favorite subject: himself.  
“In any event, I’m going to buy a brand new Tesla tomorrow morning as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American. Why should he be punished for putting his tremendous skills to work in order to help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN???”
Of course, Musk’s money troubles are in part Trump’s fault in the first place. While he is certainly experiencing some brand erosion from his cartoonishly far-right turn, Musk’s Tesla is part of the same market that Trump is actively kneecapping with his plan to enact steep tariffs on America’s closest trading partners and his inability to say whether or not the U.S. is headed for another recession. 
While Tesla’s stock flailed Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 890 points, the broader S&P 500 dropped by 2.7 percent, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped by 4 percent.
Still, the unelected bureaucrat thanked Trump for his show of support, in a post on X, which experienced severe outages Monday (that Musk managed to somehow blame on Ukraine). 
It’s not clear why Trump’s spotlight would lend any help to Musk now—the two are already publicly linked, and isn’t that part of the problem? 
The richest man in the world is trying to convince the American people that they all deserve less.
In an interview with Fox News on Monday, Elon Musk spread debunked lies about Social Security and Medicare to justify eliminating them.
“The waste and fraud in entitlement spending … that’s the big one to eliminate, that’s the sort of half trillion, maybe six or seven hundred billion a year,” Musk said.
“That is also a mechanism by which the Democrats attract and retain illegal immigrants, by essentially paying them to come here, and they’re turning them into voters. This is why the Democrats are so upset about the situation,” he added, unsubtly echoing a white nationalist, Great Replacement theory talking point while Larry Kudlow nodded along. “If we turn off this gigantic money magnet for illegal immigrants, then they will leave. And they will lose voters.”
Trump has said he won’t touch Social Security or Medicare, but Musk’s entitlement math makes it clear that both those programs, as well as Medicaid, are on the chopping block. Millions of older Americans—many of them red-state Republicans—will lose the vital benefits they rely on. And the millions of younger Americans who’ve been having those benefits taken out of their paychecks for years will never see the fruits of that.
Musk’s lies continued. “Why are there 20 million people who are definitely dead marked as alive in the Social Security database?” he asked. “Why were hundreds of millions of dollars of Small Business Administration loans given out to people aged 11 and under? We have an enormous number of people marked alive who are 160.”
This has been long debunked. 
“The reported data are people in our records with a Social Security number who do not have a date of death associated with their record. These individuals are not necessarily receiving benefits,” acting Social Security commissioner Lee Dudek said in February. 
A federal judge ruled Monday night that Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency must open its records to the public under federal law.
U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper said the DOGE office has so much power and “unusual secrecy” that its internal documents should be urgently released under the Freedom of Information Act.
“The authority exercised by USDS across the federal government and the dramatic cuts it has apparently made with no congressional input appear to be unprecedented,” Cooper wrote in his 37-page ruling, taking direct aim at Musk’s claim that the pseudo-agency is running transparently.
Cooper cited evidence that has come out in previous court cases as well as media reports about DOGE’s vast authority, contradicting the White House’s assertions that Musk is merely an adviser to the president. The office is moving quickly and giving shifting explanations on its leadership, Cooper said, demanding that DOGE release its records on a “rolling” basis within weeks.
“The rapid pace of [DOGE’s] actions, in turn, requires the quick release of information about its structure and activities,” Cooper wrote. “That is especially so given the secrecy with which DOGE has operated.”
The ruling is a big blow for Musk and DOGE, which has engaged in a mass purge of federal employees across multiple agencies without regard to their critical jobs. These include bird flu experts and people who work on the country’s nuclear arsenal, and the government has scrambled to rehire some of them. Monday night’s ruling will undoubtedly be challenged by the Trump administration, but for now, at least, Musk and Trump are being held to some measure of accountability. 
Things have gotten so bad, Fox News is finally blaming Donald Trump for the economy. 
After the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 890 points Monday, pulling back from a drop of 1,100 points at one point, Fox News hosts openly blamed the disorganization of the Trump administration. 
“The commerce secretary and the president are having different messages on the same day,” said guest Jonathan Kott, a former adviser to ex-Senator Joe Manchin. “That’s not giving the market any sort of ease or certainty for investors. So, I wouldn’t be surprised if we have an even greater crash.”
“The Dow is 1,500 points below where it was when Trump took office—that’s not a good look,” host John Roberts noted.
The broader S&P 500 also plummeted Monday, dropping by 2.7 percent. The Nasdaq Composite dropped by 4 percent.
Last week, Trump’s steep tariffs on some of America’s closest trading partners, Canada, Mexico, and China, led to a major sell-off in the stock market and a volley of new forecasts predicting a recession on the horizon. Washington Post economic columnist Heather Long said on MSNBC that it was “hard to envision” prices coming down amid the ensuing trade war.
In the wake of the harsh reality check about tariffs, the Trump administration’s messaging on this massive sell-off has been confusing.
During an interview on Fox News Sunday, Trump refused to answer easy questions about whether the U.S. economy was headed for another recession, saying, “I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we’re doing is very big.” It seems that Trump’s inability to say whether there would be a recession has only sowed more doubt in the market this week. 
Meanwhile, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick insisted on NBC News’s Meet the Press Sunday that Americans should “absolutely not” brace for a recession, and that the country was headed for a period of “transition.” And last week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned that the U.S. economy might enter a “detox period.”
This story has been updated.
Elon Musk’s social media company couldn’t stay online Monday.
X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, was down for the better part of the day, leaving users and critics to question how involved Musk should be in paring down the federal government when his own history of trimming X had effectively rendered the site unusable. 
Hours after the site first crashed, Musk took to his account to vaguely blame an outside force for the failure.
“There was (still is) a massive cyberattack against 𝕏,” Musk posted when the site momentarily came back online. “We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources. Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved.”
But even if a large group coordinated the attack, Musk’s decision to clear house at Twitter in 2022 would have been enough to hamper the site’s functionality. Shortly after acquiring the site that year, Musk chose to lay off thousands of the site’s employees in order to cut spending. That included staff in departments focusing on ethical AI, marketing and communication, search, public policy, wellness, and other teams, CNN reported at the time. 
By January 2023, the company had shed roughly 80 percent of its employees, leaving it with fewer than 550 full-time engineers, according to internal records obtained by MSNBC. One anonymous outbound employee told the network that the massive slashes would leave the remaining staff spread incredibly thin, making it “harder to maintain the service reliably.”
By Musk’s own admission, the $44 billion investment lost 90 percent of its value in the months after he acquired it in October 2022.
Two groups immediately tried to take responsibility for taking down X Monday.
Users on Reddit shared screenshots of a site that they claimed X’s web address temporarily redirected to. That page called itself “Operation DreadNought,” and labeled itself as a part of Anonymous, the decentralized international hacking group.
“We are here to fight against the fascism that has taken root in America,” the page read. “The Republican party, MAGA, Trump, and Musk are imbeciles who are drunk on power and get off on trampling down others. The American people are suffering for it. The World is suffering for it.”
Simultaneously, the pro-Palestine hacking group Dark Storm Team also claimed the DDoS attack, in a public Telegram post. 
But in an interview with Fox Business on Monday, Musk claimed—without providing proof—that the attack stemmed from a third entity.
“We’re not sure exactly what happened, but there was a massive cyberattack that tried to bring down the X system with IP addresses originating in the Ukraine area,” he said.
Voters in North Carolina voted for Donald Trump by a nearly four-point margin in November, believing that the MAGA leader would help state residents recover from storm damage in the wake of Hurricanes Helene and Milton. Then he didn’t.
Trump supporters in the Tar Heel State are still waiting for the president to direct disaster relief funds to rebuild and restore local infrastructure. Five months on since the hurricanes battered 27 counties across North Carolina, approximately “300 privately owned bridges in this county have yet to be fixed.” Those reminders are dressed with red banners, urging Trump to make the bridges “great again,” reported The Washington Post.
The residual desperation has left even Trump’s biggest champions questioning their support.
“There was a lot of desperation here and a lot of hurt at the time when he came and when the signs went up,” Robin Ollis, a local who runs a horseback riding company, told the Post. “The people that have been suffering from this storm, really, there was so much anticipation for Trump to come in.”
Trump and his allies scorched the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the midst of the disaster, spreading unfounded conspiracies that the lead response agency was out of money, and that the Biden administration had diverted funds from FEMA to assist undocumented immigrants in entering the country. (FEMA administrators have fervently and repeatedly denied this.) Conservatives, at the time, claimed that working with the White House to expedite disaster relief “seemed political,” and even conspiratorially suggested that the hurricanes were a government manipulation.
Days after his inauguration, Trump visited the damage, spouting that FEMA had failed to help the region while pitching an idea to do away with the agency altogether in favor of handing the money directly to the states. But none of that has come to fruition.
Since then, Trump has actively worked to dismantle FEMA. The administration is blocking states across the nation, including California and Michigan, from accessing preapproved relief. A coalition of Democratic-led states has sued the federal government, claiming that “hundreds of millions of dollars in FEMA grants” are still inaccessible.
“I have found myself questioning this new administration,” Gary Hicks, a North Carolina Trump voter, told the Post. “What are they going to do? … I know he’s only been in office for a month. But let’s start seeing some results.”
But North Carolinians aren’t the only ones upset with the Trump administration’s direction. Conservative voters across the country have raised their voices against Trump’s agenda, lamenting the administration’s decision to nix thousands of civil servant jobs.
“Nobody that I’ve talked to understood the devastation that having this administration in office would do to our lives,” Jennifer Piggott, a recently dismissed Treasury Department employee, told Reuters. Piggott told the newswire that she would not have supported Trump in the election if she knew then what she knows now."

34,2025-03-11,"White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt framed the current turmoil in the U.S. economy — punctuated by sinking stock prices and a softening job market — as hallmarks of a “period of economic transition.” 
During a sometimes contentious afternoon press conference at the White House on Tuesday, Leavitt blamed the current volatility on the “mess” left behind by the Biden administration.
“We are in a period of economic transition from that economic nightmare under a president who had no idea what he was doing, never held a private sector job in his life, into a golden age of American manufacturing,” Leavitt said.
Leavitt was echoing comments made over the weekend by President Donald Trump.
President Trump made headlines and rattled markets when he was asked on Fox News (FOXA+0.88%)’ “Sunday Morning Futures” whether he’s expecting a recession this year by replying: “I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big.”
Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, though, was more specific, saying on NBC’s (CMCSA+0.29%) “Meet the Press” that “there’s going to be no recession in America.”
Economists in general, though, are less rosy in their outlook.
“The chances for a recession are quite high for 2025,” said Stephen Henn, adjunct professor of economics at Sacred Heart University. He added that how much people feel it might vary greatly depending on their circumstances.
“If the reduction in government spending is not outweighed by an increase in consumer spending, business investment, and/or net exports, then we are very likely to see a recession,” Henn said.

35,2025-03-11,"Quantum computing has the potential to greatly accelerate breakthroughs in everything from pharmaceuticals to predicting stock market behavior — and these advances could be right around the corner, according to IBM (IBM+2.25%) CEO Arvind Krishna.
Artificial intelligence is all the rage in the tech industry, but the current generation of AI won’t get the industry to an all knowing artificial general intelligence model, Krishna said on Tuesday at SXSW in Austin, Texas. Breakthroughs are instead expected to come from AI working in complement with quantum computing.
“AI is learning from already produced knowledge, literature, graphics and so on, it is not trying to figure out what is going to come,” Krishna said.
Quantum computers instead work on the subatomic level and are probabilistic models. Quantum computing technology, when achieved in full, has the potential to be much faster than regular computers and could go beyond what AI systems can provide to give insights into “how nature behaves,” the IBM chief said, particularly on a sub-atomic level. 
“Once we know how nature behaves, then we can learn a lot more, because none of that is in existing knowledge,” Krishna said.
The industry’s belief in how fast quantum computing technology can scale up has wavered recently. Earlier this year, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg claimed that useful quantum computers are 15-30 years away, which tanked quantum computing stocks like IonQ (IONQ+1.13%) and Rigetti Computing (RGTI-4.14%).
Although the technology has more progress it needs to count, Krishna believes that quantum computing  is “going to surprise you before this decade is up.” 
He isn’t the only person to believe this either. Microsoft (MSFT+1.32%) co-founder Bill Gates told Yahoo Finance last month that quantum computing could become useful in as soon as 3 to 5 years.
And there have been recent advancements in quantum computing, most notably in December when Google (GOOGL+2.90%) unveiled its latest quantum chip Willow. Google claims the chip will greatly reduce error rates, one of the greatest challenges plaguing quantum technology.
On the other hand, the biggest problems facing AI, according to Krishna, are a lack of domain specificity — in depth knowledge of particular fields or application areas — as well as the technology’s notorious energy intensity.
“I’ll predict for you that five years from now, most of the models are going to be using 1% of the energy of what they’re using today,” Krishna said. “I think DeepSeek gave us a preview.”
Quantum computing, while still costly, has the potential to be less energy intensive than AI data centers.
Krishna also said that IBM is working on building practical use cases for the technology, not just investing in making the quantum computing hardware.
“In the end, to me, value in technology is not derived from the invention. Much as we love the invention, value is derived from people using it,” Krishna said.
“Sometimes, when we get ahead of ourselves, we get too focused on the invention and not on making sure that there are hundreds and thousands of different companies, private and public, that are using it. So that’s what we’re trying to get done in this case and I think we’re kind of going at the right pace in this instance,” he added.
Industry leaders will be getting together on March 20th for Nvidia’s (NVDA+2.83%) first “Quantum Day,” at the tech giant’s GPU Technology Conference to discuss where quantum computing is headed.

36,2025-03-11,"Investors weren’t sure what to make of Oracle’s (ORCL+2.37%) fiscal third-quarter earnings late Monday, which fell short of analysts’ expectations. Shares of Oracle climbed 5% in after-hours trading before sinking 3% as investors digested the missed targets. The stock was still off slightly in pre-market trading Tuesday.
While investors focused on the earnings whiff, company leaders focused on what Oracle CTO Larry Ellison called “hypergrowth” in its cloud and AI projects. Both are experiencing double-digit growth, and analysts and executives expect that to continue.
In the fiscal third quarter, Oracle reported total revenue of $14.13 billion, up 6% year over year, but short of analysts’ consensus estimates of $14.38 billion. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.47 per share, compared with expectations of $1.49 per share.
Oracle CEO Safra Catz touted a growth outlook for fiscal 2026 and 2027, pointing to continued demand for the company’s advanced artificial intelligence computing.
“ As we bring more capacity online, our revenues will clearly accelerate,” Catz said, referring to the data centers that Oracle continues to build.
“We are on schedule to double our data center capacity this calendar year,” Ellison said, adding that customer demand is at record levels.
Much of the company’s growth will come from growth in its AI and cloud services.  Catz highlighted the company’s record order backlog of $130 billion, which doesn’t include the additional revenues generated from its participation in the so-called Stargate project.
Stargate, touted by President Donald Trump as a $500 billion AI infrastructure investment right after he took office, includes tech titans such as Meta (META+1.10%) and ChatGPT maker OpenAI. Progress is already underway on the project’s first data centers being constructed in Texas.
“Each building is a half-a-million square feet,” Ellison said. “There are 10 buildings currently being built, but that will expand to 20 and other locations beyond the Abilene location, which is our first location.”

China is selling plenty of cars in Russia — and Moscow isn't entirely happy about it.

Chinese automakers sold more than one million vehicles to Russia last year, a sevenfold increase from the previous year, according to figures from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) reported by The Financial Times. Russia is China's biggest export market, with a share of about 30%.
    

        The rise prompted Moscow to raise import taxes on most cars to about $7,500 in recent weeks, up from about $5,790 in October, with further annual increases planned.
    

        A report from the Rhodium Group published in December said that Russia's decision to impose higher duties showed ""how even China's close geopolitical ally is averse to becoming a dumping ground for Chinese excess capacity.""
    

        Chinese brands owned by manufacturers including Chery, Geely, and Great Wall Motor have close to two thirds of the Russian auto market, according to the CPCA. Most have internal combustion engines, reflecting low demand for electric vehicles in Russia.
    

        The rise of Chinese manufacturers, boosted substantially by the withdrawal of Western companies following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, has sparked concern about the viability of Russian automakers.
    

        Avtovaz Maxim Sokolov, CEO of Russian state-owned carmaker AvtoVAZ, said last year that the influx of Chinese cars posed ""a real threat to the sustainable existence of the domestic automotive and component industries.""
    

        China exported 6.41 million vehicles last year, up 23% year-on-year, with Russia, Mexico and the United Arab Emirates making up the top three destinations, per the CPCA.
    

        China's more affordable high-tech premium cars — especially its EVs — are displacing German and Japanese automakers in markets such as Brazil, Mexico, and Southeast Asia.
    

        The EU voted in October to impose sweeping tariffs on Chinese EVs, while the US introduced trade restrictions in May 2024.
    

        In response, Chinese EV manufacturers such as BYD, Geely, and SAIC are expanding overseas through strategic investments and local production facilities to help avoid tariffs and tap into growing demand.

Five years on, the onset of the coronavirus pandemic is still fresh – though the speed of the news cycle can make it feel like long ago.
Some hallmarks of the pandemic era are still common: Working from home, at least some of the time. Zooming or FaceTiming with friends and associates. Masks and nasal swab tests tucked into a drawer.
While some changes happened gradually, there was one day that marked the beginning of the new era.
March 11, 2020.
On that day in the United States, the pandemic future arrived all at once.
March 11 was a Wednesday. Joe Biden had won primaries the night before in Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi and Missouri, putting him on a path toward clinching the Democratic nomination. Bernie Sanders said he was staying in the race, despite his disappointing results.
The big news in the morning — and what was expected to be the top headline of the day — was the sentencing of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. Sitting in a Manhattan courtroom, Weinstein was sentenced to 23 years in prison for rape and sexual abuse.
Two days earlier, stocks had tumbled in reaction to Saudi Arabia cutting the price of oil, spurring the market's worst drop since 2008.
And the coronavirus — which had already sparked lockdowns in China and Italy — had become a major concern in the U.S. The first case in the U.S. was announced on Jan. 21 in Everett, Wash. On Jan. 30, the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency.
Some schools in the U.S. had already closed, affecting about 850,000 students. And some Americans were trying to figure out whether to cancel the expensive cruises they had booked — days earlier, the State Department had put out a warning against such travel, following outbreaks on several ships.
The CDC had issued guidance on getting tested for the virus, but it was hard to figure out where such tests might be available. And there were instances of racism and xenophobia targeting Asian Americans as fears of the virus spread through the U.S.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, had been called to testify about the coronavirus on March 11 before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.
Observers in the chamber sat shoulder to shoulder, and there was not a mask in sight.
""Is the worst yet to come, Dr. Fauci?"" asked Rep. Carolyn Maloney, the committee chairwoman.
""Yes, it is,"" Fauci replied. He explained that the U.S. was seeing more cases from both community spread and international travel.
""I can say we will see more cases, and things will get worse than they are right now,"" Fauci said. ""How much worse we'll get will depend on our ability to do two things: to contain the influx of people who are infected coming from the outside, and the ability to contain and mitigate within our own country.""
The virus had by then infected more than 1,000 people in 40 states. At least 31 people in the U.S. had died from COVID-19, most of them in Washington state.
""Bottom line,"" Fauci said, ""it's going to get worse.""

                Workers from a Servpro disaster recovery team wearing protective suits and respirators enter the Life Care Center in Kirkland, Wash., to begin cleaning and disinfecting the facility on March 11, 2020.

In Geneva, the WHO was holding a briefing. Eight countries, including the U.S., now had more than 1,000 cases.
""In the past two weeks, the number of cases of COVID-19 outside China has increased 13-fold, and the number of affected countries has tripled,"" said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
""WHO has been assessing this outbreak around the clock and we are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction,"" he said.
""We have therefore made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic.""
The global health emergency was now officially a pandemic — the first one to be caused by a coronavirus.
The stock market reacted quickly to the new designation: the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,200 points.
By the end of the day, the Dow was down more than 20% from its peak in February – and had entered bear market territory. An 11-year bull market had come to an end.
At 3:18 p.m., with the pandemic now official and stocks cratering, President Donald Trump sent out a tweet: ""I am fully prepared to use the full power of the Federal Government to deal with our current challenge of the CoronaVirus!"" He said he would address the nation from the Oval Office that evening.
At 9:02 p.m., Trump began his remarks: ""My fellow Americans: Tonight, I want to speak with you about our nation's unprecedented response to the coronavirus outbreak that started in China and is now spreading throughout the world.""
""This is the most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history,"" he continued. ""I am confident that by counting and continuing to take these tough measures, we will significantly reduce the threat to our citizens, and we will ultimately and expeditiously defeat this virus,"" he said.
Then he made a stunning announcement: a 30-day ban on travel from European countries to the U.S., beginning on Friday at midnight — just two days later — ""to keep new cases from entering our shores.""
Experts were skeptical the ban would make much of a difference. ""It may have political value, but [it] has zero public health value,"" Lawrence Gostin, a global health law professor at Georgetown University, told NPR.
""Most of Europe has the same or fewer cases than the U.S. Restricting travel certainly won't make America safer,"" Gostin said.
Confusion followed the speech, about who and what would be affected by the ban. Trump soon tweeted a clarification: ""trade will in no way be affected by the 30-day restriction on travel from Europe. The restriction stops people not goods.""
Shortly after 9 p.m. ET, Tom Hanks posted a photo to Instagram of a surgical glove in a trash can, along with an announcement: He and his wife, actress Rita Wilson, were sick with the coronavirus.
""We felt a bit tired, like we had colds, and some body aches. Rita had some chills that came and went. Slight fevers too,"" he wrote. The two were in Australia for preproduction on a film starring Hanks.
""Well, now. What to do next?"" Hanks continued. ""The Medical Officials have protocols that must be followed. We Hanks' will be tested, observed, and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires. Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no?""
In Oklahoma City, the Thunder were about to take on the visiting Utah Jazz. Around 8 p.m. ET, shortly before tipoff, the referees and coaches conferred about an unsettling development: Jazz center Rudy Gobert's coronavirus test had just come back —positive.
The teams returned to their locker rooms. The halftime act, Frankie J, was brought out to perform for the packed arena, where fans were stirring in confusion. ""Wild times,"" said an ESPN commentator on the game's broadcast. ""The fans here in the arena don't know what's going on, we don't know what's going on.""
A moment later, the public address announcer took to the microphone. ""The game tonight has been postponed. You are all safe,"" he said. Cries of dismay rang out from the stands. ""Take your time in leaving the arena tonight, and do so in an orderly fashion.""
The Jazz tested the rest of its players and traveling party and found that a second player, Donovan Mitchell, was also positive for the virus.
Word soon got out of even bigger news: The NBA would be postponing its entire season. In Dallas, ESPN trained a camera on Mavericks owner Mark Cuban as he got the news on his phone.
He reacted in shock: His jaw dropped, and he leaned way back in his chair. ""Now it's much more personal. You've seen what's happening in other countries,"" he told a reporter a few minutes later. ""But just the whole idea that it's come this close, potentially a couple players have it ... just stunning isn't the right word. It's crazy.""
The players on the Mavericks bench were aware of the news and talking about it, Cuban said — the only ones who didn't know were the players still in the game.
At 9:46 p.m., the NBA made it official: The season was suspended until further notice.
""This is much bigger than just the NBA,"" Cuban told the reporter.
""Do we send our kids to school tomorrow? Is it that big?"" he mused. ""It's like out of a movie. It doesn't seem real.""

A photo from a White House event Tuesday captured President Donald Trump with a list of prices for Teslas that were parked on the south lawn of the White House.

        Prior to the event, Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social that he wanted to buy one of the company's electric vehicles as a show of support for Elon Musk. At a media event Tuesday afternoon, Trump saddled up to a red Model S.
    

        ""That's beautiful,"" he said, later adding that he would write a check for the car. The Model S retails for about $80,000.
    

        Trump also said he would gift his 17-year-old granddaughter, Kai, a Cybertruck — another Tesla vehicle with a starting price of nearly $80,000.
    

        Attached to a copy of Trump's speech was a handwritten note that included prices for the cars and read like a sales pitch.
    

        A photographer captured an image of the note, which read in part, ""Teslas can be purchased as low as $299/month or $35K.""
    

        While there are tax incentives for those looking to buy electric vehicles under the Inflation Reduction Act, it's unclear whether Trump would qualify for them.
    

        Under US law, presidents make $400,000 a year —far above the $300,000 maximum income cap for the EV tax credit. Back in 2016, Trump said he would only be taking a one-dollar salary during his first term. Trump has not said whether he'll be doing so for his second term.
    

        The White House didn't respond to a request for comment about the list.
    

        Trump has increasingly stepped up his support for Tesla as a show of support to Musk, who is closely tied with the White House's new DOGE office, amid growing protests against the EV company.
    

        Protesters across the US and in Europe have demonstrated against Tesla, denouncing Musk's politics, while others vandalized local Tesla showrooms.
    

        The company's stock has also taken a beating in recent months amid declining global sales and concerns that its leader is spending too much time focused on his White House role rather than his companies.
    

Tesla stock plunged 55% from record highs in mid-December. Company shares closed Tuesday at $230.58.
    

        Trump said at the Tuesday White House event that he was going to buy a Tesla ""because, number one it's a great product, as good as it gets, and number two,"" he said, pointing to Musk, ""because this man has devoted his energy and his life to doing this, and I think he's been treated very unfairly by a very small group of people.""
    

        The president said he actually wouldn't be allowed to drive it and ""hasn't driven a car in a very long time,"" but staff at the White House would be able to.
    

        Trump hasn't always been a fan of electric cars. This past summer, while speaking in Chicago at the National Association of Black Journalists, he said he was ""against everybody having an electric car,"" despite Musk's endorsement.

40,2025-03-11,Signed by AMD's CEO Lisa Su.
41,2025-03-11,"The latest market (^GSPC, ^IXIC, ^DJI) sell-off on Monday has stirred further uncertainty, but the focus should remain on long-term financial goals..."
42,2025-03-11,"Stocks ended lower on Tuesday, extending Monday’s rout, as President Donald Trump doubled down on his trade war with Canada and a warning from Delta Air Lines sent many travel-related stocks tumbling.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 478 points, or 1.1%, and the S&P 500 slid 0.8%. The Nasdaq closed down about 0.2% as a 1.7% rebound in Nvidia (NVDA+2.83%) and gains in some other Big Tech stocks weren’t enough to save the day. Shares of Apple (AAPL+1.26%) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL+2.90%) both declined.
 Trump escalated his dispute with Canada by saying he would double tariffs on the country’s aluminum and steel to 50% after Ontario enacted a levy on electricity it sends to the U.S.  The administration remains confident of the long-term benefit of its economic changes, a spokeswoman said.
“We are in a period of economic transition from that economic nightmare under a president who had no idea what he was doing, never held a private sector job in his life, into a golden age of American manufacturing,” Karoline Leavitt told reporters at the White House.
One bit of good economic news came through on Tuesday: U.S. job openings rose to 7.74 million in January from a revised 7.51 million in December, a sign that the labor market was holding steady as President Joe Biden left office. The consensus estimate had been for 7.6 million openings.
Tesla (TSLA+5.27%) stock staged a modest comeback from yesterday’s 15% plummet, rising 3.8%, as Trump said he’d buy one of Elon Musk’s EVs. 
Delta Air Lines (DAL+3.57%) stock fell 7.3% after the company cut its first-quarter profit and sales forecasts on weaker domestic travel demand. It retained its full-year outlook. American Airlines (AAL+3.57%), Expedia (EXPE+4.87%), Booking Holdings (BKNG+3.51%), Hilton (HLT+2.81%) and Airbnb (ABNB+1.53%) shares also declined. Disney (DIS+1.31%) fell 5%, extending its recent decline.
Retailers also got pummeled. Kohl’s (KSS+3.96%) plunged 24% after its quarterly earnings missed consensus and its projections also fell short. Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS+2.85%) fell 5.7% after a disappointing earnings outlook outweighed better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter results.
Southwest Airlines (LUV+3.69%) stock, by contrast, jumped 8.3% after the carrier said it will abandon its free-bags policy for most passengers, which analysts said will boost revenue but will also damage its brand and erode customer loyalty.
Oracle (ORCL+2.37%) dropped 3.1% after its fiscal third-quarter earnings fell short of analysts’ expectations.

Fixing US shipbuilding problems and revitalizing American sea power has become a top priority. A pair of Pacific allies with strong industries may have answers.

        South Korea and Japan are major shipbuilders, and US yards constructing Navy ships could learn from their approaches, a veteran naval affairs expert told lawmakers this week.
    

        In a statement to the House Armed Services Committee's Seapower and Projection Forces subcommittee, the naval affairs specialist Ronald O'Rourke highlighted the success that allies such as South Korea and Japan had seen in shipbuilding.
    

        Their approaches include in-house worker training that can address capability, operations, and materials management issues, such as ""monitoring and managing the flow of work through the shipyard on a continuous basis,"" O'Rourke, a longtime Congressional Research Service analyst, said in written testimony.
    

        They also embrace effective design and construction processes. South Korea, for instance, designs ""ship sections with a strong focus on reducing the labor hours needed to produce them,"" O'Rouke said. Doing so could mean enlarging ship sections to improve worker access to spaces and using straighter, less convoluted pipe runs ""that take up more space but require less labor to produce and install.""
    

        The cost for bigger ship sections would be higher, but the reduction in labor costs more than offsets it. The end result could make ships much ""easier and less expensive to build, maintain, and modernize over their life cycles,"" he wrote.
    

        At a congressional hearing Thursday, O'Rourke said that there were lessons to be learned from both Japan and South Korea's shipbuilding models and that the two were mentioned ""almost side-by-side"" when discussing best practices for world-class shipbuilding standards for efficient shipyard operations.
    

        Another topic of discussion has revolved around how Japan maintains a steady procurement rate amid changes in force size, a long-standing struggle for the US shipbuilding industry.
    

        There are, as O'Rourke and others said, differences between building commercial and military vessels, such as how many can be made, interior density and complexity, propulsion systems, survivability, intended life cycles, and the installation of combat systems, and all of that needs to be taken into account.
    

        But that does not mean there aren't lessons that could be applicable to US shipbuilding.
    

        In April, the then secretary of the Navy, Carlos Del Toro, said he was ""floored"" by South Korea's shipyard capabilities after a visit, especially the digitization and real-time monitoring of shipbuilding progress, which included ""regularly available information down to individual pieces of stock materials.""
    

        Top South Korean shipbuilding executives were able to pinpoint the exact day when ships would be delivered, Del Toro said at the time, a stark difference from the severe delays the US faces in shipbuilding capacity, labor availability, and resources.
    

        How the US could capitalize on and embrace the effective shipbuilding practices of allies such as Japan and South Korea — or work closer with their biggest companies — is a major focal point, as the US and its Pacific partners look carefully at China's dominant shipbuilding empire and regional security concerns.
    

        ""Japan and South Korea are in competition with China,"" O'Rourke said, ""so they are trying to hold onto their market share against the Chinese shipbuilding,"" pushing them to make their shipbuilding operations as effective as possible.
    

        Automation and streamlined production processes are key to achieving that. South Korea and Japan are, respectively, the second and third largest shipbuilders behind China.
    

Correction: March 12, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated the name of the naval affairs specialist. It's Ronald O'Rourke, not Robert O'Rourke.

The election-fueled rally is running out of fuel as major indexes give back their gains.

        The Samp;P 500 is down almost 5% so far this year and below its pre-election level. The tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged further by almost 10% as of Tuesday as investors moved away from risky bets they had crowded.
    

        So, where do we go from here? At this point, economists and strategists usually come to the rescue with their economic models and projections. But right now, it's all about the uncertainty.
    

        ""I come to the office in the morning, I see one thing, and then halfway through the day, something has been retracted or replaced or paused,"" said Rich Drage, a senior portfolio manager at RBC Global Asset Management, in an interview on March 10. It has been hard for long-term investors to position their portfolios under these circumstances.
    

        ""You're starting to see some of them just capitulate and throw their arms up, not being able to get that long-term visibility that you would need,"" he added.
    

        Earnings growth largely drives stock prices. However, since companies don't have enough certanty around tariffs, even they're having difficulty projecting their outlooks. As a result, earnings estimates are declining, Drage said.
    

        It's hitting areas like consumer discretionary, with the S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary index down by over 14% this year. Industrials are also struggling, with smaller caps being hit hard despite an expectation that they'd do better since they're more US-based. But at this point, investors are looking at the potential for higher-for-longer interest rates, inflationary pressures, and weakening demand, all of which hurt domestic companies too, he added.
    

        ""The administration doesn't seem to be offering much clarity, and it even admitted that there may be some hiccups in the economy, and they're not paying attention to the stock market,"" Drage said. ""There's probably a little room for some more risk-off, to be fair.""
    

        The macro environment isn't helping. September brought a trough for US inflation, with the consumer price index at 2.4% before it climbed back to 3% in January, with the possibility that tariffs may aggravate it further to the upside.
    

        While the unemployment rate remains steady at 4.1%, concerns over an economic slowdown and what that means for corporate spending may cause a hiring slowdown. Former Fed economist Julia Coronado told Business Insider she expects the job market to go from an average of 175,000 jobs created monthly to below 100,000. Drage added that it's just another rub that will lead people to hit the pause button on spending.
    

        It's a tough market to navigate because almost all sectors, including those traditionally seen as defensives, could be on the chopping board.
    

        ""A lot of companies that we have been speaking with have said we've been through this before during the last administration, so we already have playbooks to handle it,"" Drage said. But the difference this time is tariffs are targeting a broader array of products, and investors are more worried about that, he added.
    

        Despite all the uncertainty, Drage's task is to find long-term stocks that have the best business models able to navigate through the course of the full market cycle. That said, this time around, it's all about leaning into high-quality stocks with robust balance sheets over speculation and risk.
    

        Below, Drage shares a few key characteristics for this type of play.
    

        First, as long as inflation is a concern and interest rates either remain at the current level or increase, investors should focus on companies with self-funding business models. In other words, they don't need debt, and they don't need to issue equity to fund their operations.
    

        Next, that means avoiding companies with higher debt exposure. To quantify this a bit further, companies that are three times levered are riskier now. This can be measured by a company's debt-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Investors can look at the trailing 12-month EBITDA and compare that to the forward-looking EBITDA-to-debt to determine if there will be a significant shift.
    

        ""I've been doing this for 30-plus years. It seems to be a more conservative number when I see debt at less than three times,"" Drage said. ""When I see it over three, the company's financials get too subject to changes in interest rates, and you have to worry about cashflow being able to satisfy the debt needs.""
    

        This also means looking for companies with above-average profit margins relative to their sector and industry peers.
    

        And finally, look into their management teams and whether they have good execution over the years.

51,2025-03-11,"President Donald Trump says he will support Elon Musk’s “baby” by buying a new Tesla (TSLA+5.27%) as the automaker faces protests and sees its stock sink, partially due to their “bromance.”
Shortly after midnight on Tuesday, the president posted on his social media network Truth Social touting Musk’s support and emphasizing that Republicans should support the billionaire and richest person in the world. He then attacked the “radical left lunatics” who have been boycotting Tesla over their relationship.
“[They] are trying to illegally and collusively boycott Tesla, one of the World’s great automakers, and Elon’s ‘baby,’ in order to attack and do harm to Elon, and everything he stands for,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. Later that morning, Musk replied on his own social media platform X thanking the president.
Protests have been organized at Tesla showrooms and facilities across the country since Trump was inaugurated in January. Some have been peaceful demonstrations, such as a 300-person rally held at a Tesla dealership in Boston, although there have been several violent incidents. 
 More than a dozen violent or destructive acts have been directed at the company’s facilities since the inauguration, according to The Washington Post, including one instance where an individual planted a Molotov cocktail near a vehicle. There have been several reports of individual vehicles or Superchargers being vandalized.
In France, a dozen Teslas were set on fire near the city of Toulouse, France24 reported. And in Berlin, fires broke out at a construction site for the expansion of a Tesla factory.

The ire for Musk comes from his role leading the Department of Government Efficiency, which pushes federal agencies to issue mass layoffs, although the Trump administration disputes the nature of his role in court. The Tesla CEO has also weighed in on British and German politics, repeatedly expressed antagonism for Ukraine’s leadership, and met with various right-wing politicians. 
In solidly-blue California, traditionally Tesla’s biggest domestic market, new vehicle registrations fell 11.6% last year, according to the California New Car Dealers Association. Overseas, the company saw poor sales across Europe in January and February, while Chinese shipments fell 49% last month. Part of that decline is also tied to customers waiting for the refreshed Model Y SUV to be available. 
 Musk’s political activities have cost Tesla about $15 billion in brand value, Brand Finance told CNBC in January.
Tesla’s stock has also declined, wiping out all of the gains it made as part of a Trump-fueled post-election boom that saw it reach a new all-time high of $488 per share. The stock was trading at $228 per share pre-market trading Tuesday after rising by more than 2%, as investors see a potential sales boost from Trump’s endorsement. The stock fell 15% on Monday as part of a broad market sell-off.
“Trump’s endorsement could get millions of Republican supporters proud of Elon’s work on DOGE to follow Trump’s lead,” The Future Fund Managing Partner Gary Black, who supported Trump, wrote on X.

52,2025-03-11,"A billionaire-backed push to develop libertarian enclaves in Central America is being imported back to the United States, where its proponents want to lay the groundwork for their own privately run, corporately governed cities.
A new lobbying group, dubbed the Freedom Cities Coalition, wants to convince President Trump and Congress to authorize the creation of new special development zones within the U.S. These zones would allow wealthy investors to write their own laws and set up their own governance structures which would be corporately controlled and wouldn’t involve a traditional bureaucracy. The new zones could also serve as a testbed for weird new technologies without the need for government oversight.
Wired recently reported that the Coalition was drafting congressional legislation that would allow it to establish a network of its new “cities.” One of the chief motivations for the creation of these communities is so that new “scientific” and technological development initiatives can be carried out without the need for regulatory oversight. The outlet writes:
According to interviews and presentations viewed by WIRED, the goal of these cities would be to have places where anti-aging clinical trials, nuclear reactor startups, and building construction can proceed without having to get prior approval from agencies like the Food and Drug Administration, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the Environmental Protection Agency.
The Freedom Cities Coalition is a project of NeWay Capital, a company that has been centrally involved in the development of Prospera, a private, “free market,” crypto-friendly enclave in Honduras. Prospera was made possible by a special regulatory setup, dubbed a special economic zone (or ZEDE), that was established in the country in 2013 in the wake of a U.S.-backed coup. ZEDEs allow for private actors to essentially move into geographically partitioned areas and write their own regulatory and judicial rules.
Prospera is also part of something called the “Network State,” an anarcho-capitalist ideological movement, backed by tech-billionaires, that seeks to create privately run cities with native cryptocurrencies.
Wired reports on the efforts of the Freedom Cities Coalition to encourage President Trump and Congress to enshrine their project into federal law. Currently, the lobbyists are pursuing a number of different strategies to get some kind of law authorizing the cities’ development on the books:
Trey Goff, the chief of staff of the startup nation known as PrÃ³spera, tells WIRED that he and other PrÃ³spera representatives working under an advocacy group called the Freedom Cities Coalition have been meeting with the Trump administration about the idea in recent weeks. He claims the administration has been very receptive.
On its website, the Freedom Coalition claims that while “other nations are creating new centers of innovation, America’s regulatory environment is holding back progress.” The site continues:
“Freedom Cities are America’s boldest solution to unleash our nation’s full potential. By creating zones of regulatory clarity and economic dynamism, these specially designated areas strip away decades of bureaucratic buildup while maintaining essential protections, allowing entrepreneurs and builders to move at the speed of human ingenuity rather than the pace of paperwork.”
Where will America’s new “Freedom Cities” be built? It seems quite possible that the Network Staters want to build them in our national parks. On its website, the Freedom City Coalition notes that 28 percent of U.S. land is “federally owned and ready for innovative development.” It doesn’t specify what kind of federal land is “ready” for this “innovation,” but most of the government land that isn’t used for farming and energy development is used for wildlife conservation.
It’s also worth noting that, in a video released during the presidential campaign, Trump openly spoke about using protected federal lands to build “Freedom Cities.” âPast generations of Americans pursued big dreams and daring projects that once seemed absolutely impossible,â Trump said in the video. âThey pushed across an unsettled continent and built new cities in the wild frontier.â
Trump then called for the use of protected federal lands to develop ten new urban metropolises. These developments, he said, would âre-open the frontier, reignite American imagination, and give hundreds of thousands of young people and other people a new shot at home ownership and, in fact, the American dream.â

53,2025-03-11,"Delta Air Lines (DAL+3.57%) said it was lowering its guidance for the first quarter of 2025, citing soft domestic demand for travel and kicking off an airline stock sell-off. 
The airline expects revenue for the quarter that ends on March 31 to grow between 3% and 4% and operating margins to grow by as much as 5%. Its initial guidance had accounted for revenue growing between 7% and 9%, with its operating margin rising by up to 8%. Its forecast for adjusting earnings fell from between 70 cents per share and $1 per share to a range of 30 cents per share and 50 cents per share. 
In a securities filing, Delta said its outlook has been impacted by a decrease in consumer and corporate confidence caused by “increased macro uncertainty.” The stock market has been slammed in recent days by the threat of a recession, in part fueled by U.S. tariff plans and mass layoffs in the federal government.
More than half of Americans expect inflation will accelerate in 2025, according to a recent poll, which also found that inflation remains the dominant financial concern for most U.S. adults. Most of the survey’s respondents said their income is growing more slowly than inflation, with fewer than 20% of people in all age brackets saying their personal earnings are outpacing prices.
“We saw companies start to pull back. Corporate spending started to stall, largely domestic,” Delta CEO Ed Bastian told CNBC on Monday. “Consumers in a discretionary business do not like uncertainty.”
Government contractors and people who are worried about losing their job are “not out there spending money traveling,” Bastian noted, referring to the spending cuts in the federal government. He added that this is the “weakest” season of the year, and that most of the impact in the first quarter will be transitory. 
Delta stock dropped as much as 6% in pre-market trading before some losses were pared back. United Airlines (UAL+4.23%), Alaska Air Group (ALK+2.64%), American Airlines (AAL+3.57%), Frontier Group (ULCC+0.51%), and Spirit Airlines stock followed suit.
JetBlue Airways (JBLU+1.71%) ducked the Delta-fueled decline, rising by more than 3% in early hours trading, although the stock fell almost 10% on Monday as the broader market reacted to the threat of a recession. Southwest Airlines (LUV+3.69%) stock soared more than 9% on Tuesday after ending its long-standing free checked bags policy and adjusting its loyalty program.

54,2025-03-11,"Viking Therapeutics (VKTX+1.90%), the developer of a promising experimental weight-loss drug, has announced a multi-year partnership with CordenPharma, a leading contract manufacturing firm.
The deal covers the supply of both the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and the finished products for Viking’s weight-loss drug, VK2735, which is being developed for the treatment of obesity.
Under the agreement, Viking will make $150 million in prepayments between 2025 and 2028, with those payments credited against future orders.
In return, CordenPharma will dedicate manufacturing capacity to produce multiple metric tons of VK2735 API annually. The company will also provide  capacity to manufacture finished products for both the injectable and oral versions of the drug. This includes dedicated manufacturing lines and an annual commitment to supply 100 million autoinjectors, 100 million vials and syringe products, and more than one billion oral VK2735 tablets each year.
“CordenPharma’s established presence in commercial peptide manufacturing gives us confidence in their ability to deliver supply commensurate with what we anticipate will be significant commercial demand,” said Viking CEO Brian Lian in a press release. 
Despite the news, Viking’s stock fell over 11% on Monday morning, with some investors concerned the deal could dampen the company’s acquisition prospects. But not all Wall Street analysts agreed with the take. 
“Given the importance of procuring API and the associated devices and accessories, we argue it would be imprudent to delay such discussions even if Viking was theoretically in late-stage discussions with an acquirer,” wrote William Blair analyst Andy Hsieh in a note on Tuesday.
William Blair estimates the manufacturing capacity outlined in the agreement could translate to $39 billion in annual revenue.
In November, Viking presented data from two clinical trials of VK2735 at the Obesity Week conference in San Antonio, Texas. The trials tested both an injectable and a pill version of the drug.
In a small phase 1 clinical study, patients who took a daily 100 mg dose of Viking’s weight-loss pill lost an average of up to 6.8% of their body weight over 28 days when adjusted for those taking a placebo.
At the time, Hsieh noted that Viking’s results exceeded Wall Street expectations and outperformed Novo Nordisk’s experimental weight-loss pill, amycretin.
“Notably, the 100 mg dose appears to be outpacing the 100 mg dose of amycretin, which achieved about a 5% placebo-adjusted weight loss in four weeks,” Hsieh wrote.
In a separate phase 2 trial testing VK2735 as a weekly injection, patients experienced an average weight loss of 14.7% over 13 weeks. For comparison, patients taking the highest dose of Eli Lilly’s (LLY+2.04%) Zepbound lost over 20% of their weight after 72 weeks in a clinical trial.

For the first time ever, global smartwatch shipments declined in 2024, with Apple experiencing its sharpest downturn yet. According to a recent report by Counterpoint Research, the worldwide smartwatch market fell by 7% in 2024, marking the market's first-ever annual decline. Apple maintained its leading market share position, but saw a significant 19% year-over-year drop in shipments. Apple's shipment struggles were notably pronounced in North America, driven by the absence of anticipated models like the Apple Watch Ultra 3 and limited new features in the existing Apple Watch Series 10. Analysts attribute Apple's slide slide to tougher competition, minimal upgrades in Apple's S10 lineup, and patent issues affecting the first half of the year.   These patent issues include legal battles with medical technology firms AliveCor and Massimo.AliveCor accused Apple of infringing on its electrocardiogram (ECG) technology patents, initially securing a favorable ruling from the International Trade Commission that recommended an import ban.Apple's victory at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office led to the dismissal of the case. Meanwhile, a separate dispute with Masimo resulted in an import ban on Apple Watches containing certain ECG features.Additionally, sluggish performance from the Apple Watch SE lineup, along with no updates to these entry-level models, contributed to weaker consumer interest.

These days I always end up questioning whether people make statements from the heart or from the wallet (their investments, who they work for, some other self interested reason).From the heart (no investment in Apple, don't work for them or anyone associated, just an engineer who appreciates well engineered products), the watch is now indispensable for me. No matter how heavy I made the buzz on my phone before, I always used to miss things. That and being able to listen to music while I workout without carrying my phone around are the biggest reasons it's indispensable.That said, if they made another device which was smaller, lighter and could do the same things, I'd gladly give up wearing something on my wrist.

Elon Musk visited the White House on Tuesday with a fleet of shiny Teslas in tow. President Donald Trump was awestruck.

        ""Wow, that's beautiful,"" Trump marveled as he climbed into a cherry red Model S.
    

        ""This is a different panel than I've ever — everything's computer!""
    

Indeed.


        The visit came after the president posted on TruthSocial on Tuesday morning that he would buy a Tesla to support Musk, the electric vehicle maker's CEO and a ""special government employee"" who has become the de facto face of Trump's DOGE effort.
    

Tesla's stock has fallen in recent weeks amid worries about tariffs, slumping sales prices, and the time Musk is spending on DOGE business.
    

        ""The Radical Left Lunatics, as they often do, are trying to illegally and collusively boycott Tesla, one of the World's great automakers, and Elon's 'baby,' in order to attack and do harm to Elon, and everything he stands for,"" the president wrote Tuesday.
    

        ""I'm going to buy a brand new Tesla tomorrow morning as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American,"" he added.
    

        Trump reportedly opted for the Model S, suggesting that he was successfully seduced by the siren call of computers. (The car is, in fact, full of them, as are most other gadgets these days.) The car retails for more than $70,000. A photo of the president's notes from the event appeared to show a cheatsheet of prices for various models.
    

        Trump also said he purchased his granddaughter a Cybertruck, according to CBS reporter Kathryn Watson.
    

        Besides shelling out for a Tesla, Trump said he will label attacks against Tesla dealerships domestic terrorism.
    

        Tuesday is the latest chapter in Trump's relationship with technology, which has previously included a suspicion of wind power, a belief that planes are too complex to fly, a predilection for sharpies instead of email, and the question ""What is digital?""

NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JUNE 14: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on ... [+] June 14, 2023 in New York City. Markets have fallen on growth concerns, but will we see a recession? (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)
Fears of slower growth have spiked as the stock market has fallen in recent weeks. However, recent reported economic data has shown growth and a healthy jobs market. It remains to be seen whether the fears of consumers and businesses are realized in recession, or if predictions of decline are overdone.
Recent reported economic data has been consistent with growth. The latest estimate for Q4 gross domestic product is 2.3% growth. Unemployment is at 4.1% as of February, with the economy adding 151,000 jobs, similar to the past 12 months. That said, 4.1% unemployment is a slight rise from 4.0% in January. As a result, a recession isn’t evident in recent data, although those figures are lagging indicators and could be subject to revision. It’s often not clear that a recession has begun until afterward.
Economic fear and uncertainty are high. The Economic Policy Uncertainty Index has risen to levels not seen since the Covid-19 pandemic. That index, constructed by academics, reflects newspaper reports about government policy, expiring tax code provisions and dispersion of economic forecasts. It doesn’t mean a recession is necessarily coming, but suggests that the path for the U.S. economy is unclear. That’s unsurprising given how tariff policies are changing week to week.
The Atlanta Federal Reserve’s GDP Now model is calling for negative growth in Q1. However, that may be mostly due to a spike in non-monetary gold imports. If an adjustment is made for that, Q1 GDP may be close to zero according to the GDPNow model, rather than negative. Even with the adjustment, this would still represent a significant slowdown in growth. In contrast, the New York Fed’s Nowcast model suggests Q1 growth of around 2%, similar to Q4 levels. Of course, both these models update as more economic data comes in.
The main concern is that consumer and business confidence is falling. For example, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell noted that “recent surveys of households and businesses point to heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook. It remains to be seen how these developments might affect future spending and investment. Sentiment readings have not been a good predictor of consumption growth in recent years,” in a speech on March 7. As such, historically these readings have not be as informative as firmer economic data.
There has been an almost 10% decline in the S&P 500 since mid-February. That’s not an extreme decline, but it returns the index to levels of last September. Declines of this magnitude are fairly common, occurring roughly every two years making them more common than recessions. For example, a larger stock market decline of over 20% from January to October 2022, that stock market slump did not result in a recession.
Still, the market can be accurate, too. The sharp market decline in early 2020 was an accurate indicator of the pandemic recession.
The current fall in the market shows economic risk is elevated, but a recession is not guaranteed. The market is also trading at historically elevated valuation levels, so falling prices could represent changing attitudes to risk and valuation, rather than declining economic growth.
Recession risk is currently elevated, but a recession is not certain. For example, prediction market Kalshi currently puts the chance of a recession in 2025 at 40%. That’s higher than average, but still doesn’t suggest a recession will occur.
Historic data, for Q4 and into February 2025 is, so far, reasonably positive, but could be subject to revision. Forward looking data suggests very high uncertainty. Clearly, there is a path for the U.S. to see a recession in 2025, especially with the possible impact of tariffs in disrupting economic activity. However, much will depend on economic reports for March and April in showing whether the fears of businesses and consumers become reality, or if recession risks are currently exaggerated."

MSFT Stock
 
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock experienced a decline of over 3% on Monday, March 10, amid a broader Wall Street downturn. This sell-off was triggered by mounting concerns over President Donald Trump’s tariff policy and its wider impact on the economy. This resulted in the Dow Jones falling 2.1%, the S&P 500 dropping 2.7%, and NASDAQ plunging 4.0%, marking its worst day since September 2022. Our take on market crash risk right now has more details on tariffs and its impact on the broader market.
At its current levels of $380, MSFT stock looks attractive but volatile - making it a tricky pick to buy. We believe there is minimal cause for concern with MSFT stock, which makes it attractive but highly sensitive to adverse events as its current valuation is very high. Separately, with earnings due this week, see How QBTS Stock Might React To Upcoming Earnings?
 We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of MSFT stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Microsoft along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a very strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. However, if you seek upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception.
Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, MSFT stock looks expensive compared to the broader market.
• Microsoft has a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 11.3 vs. a figure of 3.2 for the S&P 500
 • Additionally, the company's price-to-operating income (P/EBIT) ratio is 25.1 compared to 24.3 for S&P 500
 • And, it has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.5 vs. the benchmark’s 24.3
Microsoft's Revenues have seen notable growth over recent years.
• Microsoft has seen its top line grow at an average rate of 13.5% over the last 3 years (vs. increase of 6.9% for S&P 500)
 • Its revenues have grown 15.0% from $228 Bil to $262 Bil in the last 12 months (vs. growth of 5.2% for S&P 500)
 • Also, its quarterly revenues grew 12.3% to $70 Bil in the most recent quarter from $62 Bil a year ago (vs. 5.0% improvement for S&P 500)
Microsoft's profit margins are considerably higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe.
• Microsoft's Operating Income over the last four quarters was $118 Bil, which represents a considerably high Operating Margin of 45.0% (vs. 13.0% for S&P 500)
 • Microsoft's Operating Cash Flow (OCF) over this period was $126 Bil, pointing to a considerably high OCF-to-Sales Ratio of 48.0% (vs. 15.7% for S&P 500)

Microsoft's balance sheet looks strong.
• Microsoft's Debt figure was $62 Bil at the end of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $2.9 Tril (as of 3/10/2025). This implies a very strong Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 2.1% (vs. 19.0% for S&P 500). [Note: A lower Debt-to-Equity Ratio is desirable]
 • Cash (including cash equivalents) makes up $72 Bil of the $534 Bil in Total Assets for Microsoft. This yields a moderate Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 13.4%(vs. 14.8% for S&P 500)

MSFT stock has seen an impact that was slightly better than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. Worried about the impact of a market crash on MSFT stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes.
• MSFT stock fell 36.0% from a high of $334.75 on 3 January 2022 to $214.25 on 3 November 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500
 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 2 June 2023
 • Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $467.56 on 7 July 2024 and currently trades at around $380

• MSFT stock fell 27.7% from a high of $187.28 on 19 February 2020 to $135.42 on 16 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500
 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 8 June 2020

• MSFT stock fell 59.1% from a high of $37.06 on 4 November 2007 to $15.15 on 9 March 2009, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500
 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 6 November 2013

In summary, Microsoft's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows:
• Growth: Very Strong
 • Profitability: Extremely Strong
 • Financial Stability: Very Strong
 • Downturn Resilience: Neutral
 • Overall: Very Strong
Hence, despite its very high valuation, the stock appears attractive but volatile, which supports our conclusion that MSFT is a tricky stock to buy.
Not too happy about the volatile nature of MSFT stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

    The Federal Reserve's second policy meeting of the year won't change much for mortgage rates in the near term.
  
The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady at its monetary policy meeting this week — though sticky inflation, increased unemployment and slowing economic growth could force the central bank to cut rates in late spring or early summer. 
As recession fears mount and uncertain trade policies pressure financial markets, the key question for investors was how the Trump administration's economic austerity measures and tariffs would influence the Fed's interest rate forecast. 
""Policy is not on a preset course,"" Fed chair Jerome Powell said during Wednesday's press conference. ""We do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance, and we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.""
The Fed is tasked with maintaining maximum employment and containing inflation. A sluggish economy typically warrants interest rate cuts to stimulate growth, but lowering rates too quickly could fuel price growth when inflation is still above target. 
Still, the Federal Reserve, which sets a short-term benchmark interest rate for lenders, only indirectly impacts the mortgage market. In 2024, the central bank cut interest rates three times, but mortgage rates didn't fall.
That's because rates are primarily driven by movement in the bond market, specifically on the 10-year Treasury yield. Bond yields and interest rates rise or fall depending on how new economic data shifts market speculation and risk assessment. Until the impact of the administration's policies is clearer, mortgage rates will continue to fluctuate.

Fannie Mae projects mortgage rates to stay above 6.5% for the better part of the year. Yet lenders base their rates on a range of factors, and no forecast is set in stone. Given the precarious nature of the economy, any sign of risk or disruption could lower bond yields and impact the trajectory of mortgage rates. 
If an economic downturn appears likely, for example, mortgage rates could start decreasing, but they would need to drop closer to 5.5% to bring buyers into the market at scale, according to Alex Thomas, senior research analyst at John Burns Research and Consulting. 
While cheaper home loan rates are positive for housing affordability, a shaky economy could keep the housing market frozen. ""If lower mortgage rates are the result of a recession, housing demand could remain muted,"" said Thomas.
Prospective homebuyers who have been waiting for mortgage rates to drop for the past few years may need to adjust to the ""new normal"" in the mortgage market, with rates fluctuating between 5% and 7% over the longer term. That may seem high compared to the recent 2% rates of the pandemic era. But experts say getting below 3% on a mortgage is unlikely without a severe economic downturn. Since the 1970s, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has been around 7%. 
Today's unaffordable housing market isn't just a result of high mortgage rates. A long-standing housing shortage, expensive home prices and a loss of purchasing power due to inflation have locked out buyers over the last several years.
With the spring homebuying season fast approaching, prospective homebuyers are left wondering whether to enter the market or continue waiting on the sidelines. It's never a good idea to rush into buying a home without establishing a clear budget. 
Here's what experts recommend before purchasing a home: 
💰 Build your credit score. Your credit score will help determine whether you qualify for a mortgage and at what interest rate. A credit score of 740 or higher will help you qualify for a lower rate.
💰 Save for a bigger down payment. A larger down payment allows you to take out a smaller mortgage and get a lower interest rate from your lender. If you can afford it, a down payment of at least 20% will also eliminate private mortgage insurance.
💰 Shop for mortgage lenders. Comparing loan offers from multiple mortgage lenders can help you negotiate a better rate. Experts recommend getting at least two to three loan estimates from different lenders.
💰 Consider mortgage points. You can get a lower mortgage rate by buying mortgage points, with each point costing 1% of the total loan amount. One mortgage point equals a 0.25% decrease in your mortgage rate."

    Looking for simple ways to positively impact your gut health? Incorporate these probiotic-rich foods into your diet.
  
You'll find probiotics in a number of foods, including yogurt, sauerkraut and more. 
A balanced microbiome, which is the fancy name for the community of beneficial microbes living in your intestines, is the basis for a healthy gut. While probiotic supplements can help maintain this balance, you can also get a natural boost from everyday foods, which can help save money while also supporting your digestive health.
""Probiotics are live microorganisms, often called 'good bacteria,' that help maintain a healthy balance in your gut by promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria and suppressing harmful ones,"" says Gillean Barkyoumb, registered dietitian and nutrition expert at Plexus Worldwide, which sells dietary supplements.
""Probiotics are commonly found in fermented foods like yogurt, kefir and sauerkraut, as well as in dietary supplements,"" she adds. ""Regularly consuming probiotics can support digestion, boost your immune system and may even improve mood and overall well-being.""

Ultimately, probiotics contribute to your digestive health, which in turn can reduce depression, improve mental health, promote heart health, boost your immune system and give your skin a healthy glow. Good gut bacteria can also help promote a healthy metabolism, which can reduce the risks of disorders such as obesity and diabetes. If you want to boost your gut health naturally, always consult your doctor first.
If you want more probiotics in your diet, below are 12 excellent probiotic foods. In addition to these foods, you might also try probiotic supplements. Look for labeling that reads, ""contains live cultures"" or ""contains active cultures"" in these common probiotic foods.
A staple probiotic food, go for yogurt with live and active cultures. Some yogurts are specifically marketed for their probiotic content or to help improve digestion. Yogurt usually has L. acidophilus bacteria, which can promote the growth of good bacteria in your gut. Yogurt is a great option because it's widely available, comes in a variety of flavors to suit your taste and can be eaten straight from the container.
Kimchi is a traditional Korean side dish made by fermenting vegetables with probiotic lactic acid bacteria. Kimchi can give you that probiotic punch, and it's made with healthy ingredients like vegetables (most commonly Napa cabbage, carrots, scallions and radish), garlic, red pepper powder, ginger and other spices. It makes a wonderful side and is traditionally served with steamed rice. Kimchi is associated with research regarding anti-cancer, anti-obesity, colorectal health, cholesterol reduction, anti-aging, brain health, immune health and skin health properties.
You might be surprised to learn that pickles can contain probiotics. You just have to make sure you buy fermented pickles, which are usually found in the refrigerated section of the health food aisle. Some brands even advertise probiotic content. They trend under the term ""healthy pickles,"" but be sure to read the labels to ensure they contain probiotics. You can even make them at home. Some people also drink or use the juice the pickles are fermented in. Note that jarred pickles tend to be high in sodium.
Sourdough starter contains lactic acid bacteria. The starter is the environment where yeast and good bacteria grow by consuming water and flour. Natural prebiotics and probiotics are listed in research as one of the benefits of sourdough bread. It's also linked to better blood glucose control, reduced cholesterol, a lower risk of diabetes, reduced cardiovascular disease risk and improved weight control. Also, it makes a pretty good sandwich bread.
Kefir is a fermented milk made using kefir grain. It starts as a normal cow's or goat's milk, and then a grain-like yeast and lactic acid bacterial colony called kefir is added to the milk. The mixture is left to ferment for around a day and then the milk is filtered from the grains, creating the kefir drink. The resulting drink is a powerful probiotic that actually packs more probiotics than yogurt.
Kombucha is ""a go-to for fermented botanicals,"" Barkyoumb says. ""This magic potion has been dubbed the 'immortal health elixir' because of its ability to support whole-body health and wellness while preventing illnesses. High-quality kombucha is filled with probiotics and amino acids that will help your body digest sugar, and is also a great natural hangover cure.""
This drink is actually a fermented tea, so you're getting the health benefits of tea with the probiotic boost of a fermented beverage. It's made by adding strains of bacteria, yeast and sugar to either black or green tea, which leads to the drink's probiotic-happy environment. It ferments for about a week or more until it grows a mushroom-type texture on top. The mushroom gets filtered out to make new kombucha.
This German comfort food is fermented cabbage made by lacto-fermenting the vegetable in its brine with salt. As part of the traditional fermentation process, probiotics are in the end product.
However, this is another product where you have to specifically buy probiotic sauerkraut or make your own. Many brands use vinegar and sugar or are pasteurized, which reduces the growth of bacteria and kills probiotics. Common canned sauerkraut is usually made with vinegar or it's pasteurized (or both).
This Japanese food is served as a side to many meals. Miso is a paste typically made from fermented soybeans and works as a condiment to make sauces, spreads and soup stock. Miso soup uses this paste for the stock. Because miso is a fermented food, it packs the probiotic punch. Miso soup works great with larger meals but it also makes a nice, light lunch on its own.
Apple cider vinegar is twice-fermented apple juice. Apple cider vinegar has been making its rounds for years as a popular health supplement. It has natural probiotics from the fermentation process. Though its benefits need further research, many people also use it for everything from calming acid reflux to weight loss. It has a strong flavor, so if you don't like taking it directly, add it to salad dressing, marinades or pickling liquid.
Certain types of cheese have probiotics. For instance, aged cheeses that are not heated afterward tend to have probiotics. Examples include Swiss, Gouda, cheddar, Edam, Gruyère, cottage cheese and provolone. The good news is that many popular cheese types have probiotics, including a healthy bowl of cottage cheese topped with fruit.
Along the same lines as the kimchi and pickles above, you can also look for any pickled vegetables that specifically list having probiotics. One idea is to look into lacto-fermented escabeche, a pickled dish from Mexico that can contain a wide variety of vegetables. Or you can make a fermented giardiniera, an Italian pickle relish. Using fermented pickled vegetables is also a great way to shop locally and preserve vegetables for use out of season.
Buttermilk may seem like a drink out of Little House on the Prairie, but traditional buttermilk can be an excellent source of probiotics. Buttermilk covers different types of fermented dairy beverages, but traditional buttermilk is the liquid skimmed out of the butter-making process. The trick is to avoid cultured buttermilk, which is the most common type in supermarkets and usually does not have probiotics."

67,2025-03-11,"Senator Tommy Tuberville claimed that the stock market collapse caused by Trump's tariffs was because it has been over bloated and people keeping scoreboards. 
Is this idiot serious?
Tuberville knows as much about the stock market as does a child playing in a sandbox when asked to explain the debt ceiling. 
There are always corrections in the market, but this collapse was predicated solely by Trump's moronic yo-yo tariffs and telling the country a recession might be in order. 
The market works by keeping score, you fucking twit.

TUBERVILLE: And the only problem you have with these tariffs, there's always a scoreboard and that's going to be the stock market.
And people are looking at the stock market like, hey, this is how it's going to continue to be for months and months and months.
That's not going to happen.
You know, we were probably over bloated with the stock market here for a while.
We went up quite a bit.
But at the end of the day, it's about fairness, it's about having fair tariffs, everybody on the same page. And again, we've got President Trump has put together a smart group of people that understand a lot about the dollar, a lot about foreign currency.
All the things are going on at the end of the day.
It's all going to work out and it's going to work out better for the United States of America.

There is nothing fair about Trump's tariffs. The stock mark has been collapsing since Trump began waxing poetically about his beautiful tariffs that will make the country rich. 
Trump's people are forced to promote tariffs because TrumpJesus told them to. They understand that if the US puts tariffs on our trade partners, they will in kind do the same to us, which will cause prices to skyrocket. 
It's not rocket science.
It's not fifth grade math.

68,2025-03-11,"The selloff on Tuesday extended losses suffered a day earlier.
U.S. stocks dropped on Tuesday, extending losses suffered a day earlier amid a fresh round of tariffs on Canada and concern about a possible recession.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down about 475 points, or 1.15%, while the S&P 500 fell 0.75%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq ticked down 0.15%.
The selloff on Tuesday extended a days-long market decline touched off by U.S. tariffs imposed last week on Canada, Mexico and China, some of which were delayed.
President Donald Trump on Tuesday announced retaliatory measures on Canada after Ontario slapped a 25% tariff on electricity sent to the U.S., saying that he is imposing an additional 25% tariff on steel and aluminum, bringing those tariffs to 50%.
Hours later, Ontario Premier Doug Ford issued a joint statement with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on X announcing the suspension of the 25% surcharge on electricity sent to the U.S.
The withdrawal of the surcharge came alongside an agreement to hold a meeting at the White House on Thursday to discuss a renewal of the trade agreement between the U.S. and Canada, the statement said.
The increased tariffs on steel and aluminum are still expected to go into effect on Wednesday as planned, White House spokesperson Kush Desai told ABC News Tuesday afternoon.
The tit for tat marked the latest in a global trade war that intensified a day earlier, when China slapped retaliatory tariffs on the U.S., deepening trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies.
On Monday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq plummeted 4%, recording its worst day of trading since 2022. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 each dropped more than 2% on Monday.
The market drawdown on Monday extended losses from last week. The S&P 500 recorded its worst week since September.
When asked about a potential recession in an interview broadcast on Sunday, Trump said tariffs imposed in recent days could bring about a ""period of transition.""
""I hate to predict things like that,"" Trump told Fox News in an interview recorded on Thursday. ""It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us.”
In response to a question later on Sunday about his reluctance to rule out a recession, Trump said: ""I tell you what, of course you hesitate. Who knows?""
The Bureau of Labor Statistics is expected Tuesday morning to release a report on how many jobs are open in the economy, which could provide another clue about the strength of economy amid the new recession concerns. An inflation report is expected Wednesday.

    Ford EV owners can now find Tesla Superchargers via Apple Maps, and they can charge more easily and reliably.
  
Ford's new NACS Fast Charging Adapter is easier to hold and connects more securely.
It's been a year since Ford's EVs unlocked third-party access to Tesla's Supercharger network using complimentary NACS Fast Charging Adapters. This week, the automaker doubled down on its commitment to the North American Charging System, adding NACS Fast Charger Routing via Apple Maps in CarPlay and a second-gen NACS Fast Charging Adapter adapter for its F-150 Lighting electric pickup and Mustang Mach-E SUV. The new adapter promises to be easier and more reliable to use.
In 2023, Ford was the first of a deluge of automakers to announce support for the Tesla-pioneered North American Charging System. A year later, it was the first to make good on the pledge by supplying a free NACS charging adapter to any owner who requested one between February and June of 2024. Today, one year later, Ford has fulfilled that initial commitment, shipping around 140,000 complementary adapters to reservation holders across the US. According to the automaker, its drivers make extensive use of those adapters. Nearly 20% of Ford EV charging visits away from home happen at Tesla Supercharger stations.
NACS and Tesla Supercharger stations now appear as suggestions when planning large trips via Apple CarPlay.
The addition of Tesla's V3 Superchargers grows the BlueOval Charge Network -- Ford's database of compatible charging stations -- to an estimated 44,000 DC fast charging points across North America. Drivers can find and navigate to those stations via their vehicle's on-board navigation, the FordPass app and, now, Apple Maps EV Routing.
Just yesterday, Ford Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning drivers gained the ability to include NACS fast charging stations into trips calculated via Apple Maps EV Routing in CarPlay. Apple Maps can now detect the host EV's state of charge to calculate when you'll need to plug in and can suggest charging stops along the route, including Tesla Superchargers, when planning longer trips. Suggested stops at NACS stations include a warning reminding you to bring the Fast Charging Adapter. However, because Apple CarPlay is separate from the core EV systems, battery preconditioning is not supported alongside Apple Maps EV routing.
To test the new adapter, Ford and Lectron subjected it to snow, water, impact and even a crush test beneath an F-150 Lightning EV.
Today, Ford also announced the second-gen NACS adapter. Co-developed with EV charging accessory manufacturer Lectron, the new Ford Fast Charging Adapter is said to be more robust and reliable, able to stand up to a wide variety of climates, conditions and abuses that owners may subject it to over the vehicle's lifetime -- from snow to water submersion to being run over by an F-150 Lightning electric truck. The adapter has an integrated handle that's more ergonomic and easier to grip than the stubby previous generation, as well as new vehicle interlock that prevents accidentally unplugging the adapter during charging.
At $200 when ordered from Ford's website or service centers, the new Ford Fast Charging Adapter is also slightly cheaper than its $230 predecessor -- and given Lectron's experience building and shipping its own adapter, I'd wager it's also more likely to be in stock.

QCOM Stock
 
Question: How would you feel if you owned Qualcomm stock and it dropped by 40% or more in the coming months? It may sound extreme, but such a scenario has occurred before – and it could happen again. So far this year, Qualcomm stock has performed reasonably well, rising by about 5% since early January, while the S&P 500 declined by about 2% during the same period. However, several near-term challenges could affect Qualcomm, including the company’s increasing exposure to China, growing macroeconomic concerns in the U.S. following President Donald Trump’s tariffs on key trading partners, and, to some extent, Apple’s push into the mobile modem space. We believe there is a possibility that the stock could drop below $100 per share. Here is why investors should be concerned. Separately, amid economic uncertainty and a weak tech sector, Should You Buy MSFT Stock At $380?
Here’s the point: during an economic downturn, QCOM stock could suffer significant losses. Recent evidence from 2022 shows that AMD stock lost over 40% of its value within just a few quarters. Could Qualcomm’s roughly $160 stock slide to below $100 if a similar scenario were to occur? Of course, individual stocks tend to be more volatile than a diversified portfolio – so if you seek growth with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and delivered returns exceeding 91% since its inception.
Qualcomm has experienced increased demand in China, fueled by the rising popularity of premium Android devices. Its licensing business is also gaining momentum, having secured long-term agreements with Chinese manufacturers Honor and Shenzhen Transsion Holdings. Notably, Chinese companies contributed 46% of Qualcomm’s total revenue in the last fiscal year. Nevertheless, this exposure to China carries significant risks, especially as the U.S.-China trade war intensifies under Donald Trump. The new administration is expected to raise tariffs on Chinese imports from 10% to 20%, which could affect Qualcomm’s revenue streams directly or indirectly if Chinese firms retaliate by imposing their own restrictions or reducing purchases of U.S.-made components. Additionally, some of the current demand from China might be temporary, as OEMs could be stockpiling chips in anticipation of future trade tensions.
Recently, Trump proposed a “25% or higher” tariff on all semiconductor chips imported into the U.S. Such measures could hurt Qualcomm, which depends heavily on Chinese manufacturing and exports. Trump’s aggressive actions on tariffs and immigration have also raised concerns about a potential resurgence of inflation. Consequently, the U.S. economy might face a downturn – possibly even a recession – as discussed in our analysis here on the macro picture. When combined with heightened geopolitical uncertainty resulting from bold policies by the new Trump administration, these factors represent critical risks. Moreover, with the Ukraine-Russia conflict still ongoing and trade remaining uncertain, tariffs tend to increase import costs, typically leading to price hikes, reduced disposable income, and weaker consumer spending. This scenario could adversely affect AMD’s core CPU business, as delays in PC and laptop purchases may reduce chip demand.
Apple’s development of its own modem chips also poses a risk to Qualcomm. The recently launched entry-level iPhone 16e features an Apple-designed modem, the Apple C1, which replaces Qualcomm’s chipsets. Although Qualcomm does not break out revenue by customer, estimates suggest that Apple accounts for over 20% of its total sales – a significant portion of Qualcomm’s revenue. While we expect Apple’s transition to its own chips to be gradual, the impact on Qualcomm’s margins could be substantial, given that Apple’s devices typically require cutting-edge technology and premium components. Although this risk has been recognized for some time, it continues to present a downside for Qualcomm’s financial performance.
QCOM stock has experienced a performance that was slightly better than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some recent downturns. Concerned about how a market crash might affect QCOM stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Qualcomm Stock Go In A Market Crash? provides a detailed analysis of the stock’s performance during and after past market crashes.
• QCOM stock declined by 44.9% from a high of $188.69 on 17 January 2022 to $103.88 on 3 November 2022, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500
 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-crisis peak by 14 May 2024
 • Since then, the stock has risen to a high of $227.09 on 19 June 2024 and is currently trading around $160
• QCOM stock dropped by 32.7% from a high of $90.56 on 19 February 2020 to $60.91 on 22 March 2020, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500
 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-crisis peak by 8 June 2020
• QCOM stock decreased by 48.2% from a high of $56.37 on 17 August 2008 to $29.21 on 20 November 2008, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500
 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-crisis peak by 10 February 2011
Qualcomm’s Revenues have experienced steady growth in recent years, and the stock is trading at a relatively reasonable 17x forward earnings multiple. The company’s top line has grown at an average rate of 7.2% over the past three years, although growth rates are expected to slow significantly by 2026, with a larger portion of Apple’s business likely shifting away. Additionally, fundamentals can change rapidly amid the ongoing trade war.
Given this slowdown in growth and broader economic uncertainties, ask yourself the question: Do you intend to hold your QCOM stock now, or will you panic and sell if it begins to drop to $120, $100, or even lower levels? Holding onto a declining stock is never easy.Trefis collaborates with Empirical Asset Management—a Boston area wealth manager—whose asset allocation strategies yielded positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P lost more than 40%.

Wherever Felix Lee goes, the lights — and Louis Vuitton — seem to follow.

        On Monday, the 24-year-old Australian-born K-Pop singer showed up at LV's March Fall-Winter 2025 show in Paris for his second time on the catwalk.
    

        He walked the runway wearing pieces designed by Nicolas Ghesquire, LV's artistic director for womenswear.
    

        The look: Loose checked pants with a black and beige knit sweater paired with a teal duffel bag with orange straps. Lee's hair — freshly bleached blonde — was straight and slicked back, reminiscent of his first appearance on the LV catwalk in 2023.
    

        Lee — who is based in South Korea and part of the eight-member band Stray Kids — is one of Ghesquire's latest muses. And while it's now common to see at least one South Korean pop star sitting front-row at fashion shows in New York, London, and Paris, it's still rare for one of them to walk the runway for a major brand.
    

        Before Monday's show, Lee posted stories on Instagram with Ghesquire, where the designer said it was a ""big honor"" to have Lee at his show.
    

        In several of the brand's videos, Lee has spoken extensively about his friendship with Ghesquire.
    

        In a March video from LV, Lee said he first met Ghesquire in 2023 in Seoul.
    

        ""It's such a huge pleasure to meet him up front, and from there on, we became good friends,"" he said in the video.
    

        He said Ghesquire personally invited him to walk in the LV Fall-Winter 2024 show in Paris.
    

        ""The fact that I got to attend and do my first runway for Nicolas' 10th-anniversary runway — honestly, it just blew my mind,"" Lee said in a May interview with Vogue.
    

        Lee's Instagram page, which had 26.2 million followers as of press time, is full of pictures of him wearing LV pieces.
    

        In a September post, he wore a black tee with the words ""Vuitton Louis icons"" emblazoned on it.
    

        Another October post showed him carrying the brand's Neverfull bag.
    

 View this post on Instagram            


A post shared by Felix (@yong.lixx)


        Lee's meteoric rise in LV's hall of muses comes as LV bets big on Asian endorsements.
    

        Lisa from the K-Pop girl group Blackpink, who was previously the face of Celine, joined LV as a brand ambassador in July.
    

        And back in 2021, LV tapped BTS as house ambassadors.
    

        The larger LVMH business, too, has added K-Pop idols to its roster of ambassadors.
    

        In 2023, Dior and Tiffany & Co. made Jimin — one of the seven members of BTS — their brand ambassador. V, also from BTS, became the face of Celine and Cartier the same year.
    

        In 2021, Tiffany & Co. signed Blackpink singer Ros to be the face of the brand. Her bandmate, Jisoo, was chosen as Dior's global ambassador in 2021.
    

        To be sure, the connections between Korean pop culture and Western high fashion have been over a decade in the making.
    

        G-Dragon — the leader of BIGBANG, the top band in South Korea's pop scene in the 2000s — was one of Chanel's hottest faces in Asia. The rapper was friends with the late Karl Lagerfeld and, in 2015, walked in Chanel's haute couture show in Paris.
    

        Jacob Cooke, the CEO of the China-based marketing firm WPIC Marketing + Technologies, said that LV's strategy of featuring K-Pop stars like Lee is a ""continuation of its broader East Asia approach, where luxury brands use celebrity endorsements to cultivate deep emotional connections with consumers.""
    

        ""South Korea has long been a cultural powerhouse for luxury, driving trends across Asia and beyond, particularly through K-Pop and K-drama fandoms, so LV's investment in stars like Felix Lee makes sense in terms of market positioning for the entire region,"" Cooke said.
    

        However, Cooke said celebrity endorsements may not always be effective for sustained brand growth, as the brand risks appearing ""too mass market"" and less ""aspirational.""
    

        Representatives for Lee at JYP Entertainment and Louis Vuitton did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

73,2025-03-11,"Global sales of smartwatches have fallen for the first time, new figures indicate, in large part due to a sharp decline in the popularity of market leader, Apple.
Market research firm Counterpoint says 7% fewer of the devices were shipped in 2024 compared to the year before.
Shipments of Apple Watches fell by 19% in that period, Counterpoint says.
It blames the slump on a lack of new features in Apple's latest devices, and the fact a rumoured high-end Ultra 3 model never materialised.
""The biggest driver of the decline was North America, where the absence of the Ultra 3 and minimal feature upgrades in the S10 lineup led consumers to hold back purchases,"" said Counterpoint senior research analyst Anshika Jain.
Apple was also hit with sales and import bans in the US in late 2023 and early 2024 over a disputed patent regarding blood oxygen level monitoring - which Ms Jain says also contributed to lower sales figures in the first half of 2024.
It retained 22% of market share in the final three months of 2024, down from 25% a year earlier.
""We've been through a period where the smartwatch has gone from being a new and exciting gadget, to something now that's stabilising - the feature set isn't changing very dramatically year over year,"" said Leo Gebbie, principal analyst at CCS Insight.
Despite the overall decline, last year did see a massive rise in sales for Chinese-made smartwatches from brands such as Xiaomi, Huawei and Imoo.
Sales in China also grew from 19% of the market to 25% in the year from the last quarter of 2023.
This was the first time it recorded more smartwatch sales than India or North America, according to Counterpoint.
The Chinese manufacturers also appeared to tap into another trend - the growing popularity of smartwatches for children, the only segment of the market to grow in 2024.
Imoo, known in China as ""Little Genius"", specialises in children's smart watches and saw a 22% rise in shipments.
""The kids' smart watch segment is gaining traction as parents are concerned for their children's safety, and they desire to track and stay constantly connected with their children,"" Counterpoint's Balbir Singh said.
But Imoo was eclipsed by a 135% rise in shipments from Beijing-based tech company Xiaomi.
Its Smart Band activity trackers sell for a fraction of the price of rivals made by Apple and Samsung.
""We're seeing the large consumer electronics players like Apple and Samsung really just look to drive a way higher margin and not engage in the price war,"" said Mr Gebbie. 
""Xiaomi has done a really good job of selling devices, particularly in regions like southern and eastern Europe where that greater affordability tends to resonate a lot more strongly with customers.""
Another large contributor to the global sales drop was India, which fell from 30% of the market to 23%.
He said this was partly because of a ""bubble"" in ultra-cheap devices from Indian manufacturers which has now burst.
""We read and saw a lot in terms of complaints about the quality of devices, with people being unhappy with them,"" he said.
""For those companies, there's been a sense that from this point onwards they would be better served by maybe making and selling products with a slightly longer lifespan.""
Counterpoint says it expects a small recovery in the global market, with ""single-digit percentage growth in 2025"".
It predicts the uptick in sales will be driven by the increasing adoption of AI features, and a greater emphasis of providing a wider range of health data.

Market downturns create fear, panic, and uncertainty. Yet history's greatest investors have built their fortunes not by fleeing these conditions, but by embracing them.
""What we learn from history is that people don’t learn from history,"" Warren Buffett famously observed. When markets plunge, most investors forget the fundamental truth that these cycles are inevitable and temporary. Buffett and his longtime partner, Charlie Munger, repeatedly emphasized that they made most of their money during bear markets—not by timing the bottom perfectly, but by remaining rational when others succumbed to emotion.
Mastering your emotions during market turbulence isn't just about psychological resilience—it's about creating wealth. Here are five essential rules to transform market panic into profit:
When the market drops sharply, uninformed investors panic because they don't truly understand their investments. If you own high-quality businesses with strong fundamentals, market volatility becomes an opportunity rather than a threat. Develop deep knowledge about each company in your portfolio—its business model, competitive advantages, and financial health. This knowledge creates conviction that withstands temporary price swings.
Develop clear criteria for what constitutes a great business. Is it high margins? Strong free cash flow? Network effects? Market leadership? When you have established standards, you'll recognize quality amid the chaos. Without these principles, you'll find yourself chasing whatever seems safest in the moment—a recipe for buying high and selling low.
The market offers prices every day, but only occasionally offers value. Learning to calculate what a business is truly worth—through discounted cash flow analysis, comparable company evaluation, or other methodologies—allows you to recognize genuine bargains when they appear. As your valuation skills improve, so too will your confidence in acting contrary to market sentiment when opportunities arise.
This often-overlooked factor provides enormous advantage. Most investors constantly react to market movements, news cycles, and quarterly reports. By committing to a longer timeframe—thinking in years, not months—you escape the tyranny of short-term volatility. This discipline transforms market downturns from emergencies into opportunities.
The leadership steering a company through turbulent times often determines its ultimate success. Consider Jamie Dimon at JPMorgan Chase. With a significant portion of his net worth invested in company stock, he has led the bank to market leadership in its key sectors while building a deep management bench.
When the NASDAQ drops 4% in a day, remember: JPMorgan didn't lose 4% of its customers, nor did its employees put in 4% less effort. The underlying business remains largely unchanged despite the market's dramatic reaction.
The reward for mastering these five principles is substantial: while others panic during downturns and sell valuable businesses at steep discounts, you'll have both the emotional composure and analytical framework to capitalize on their fear.

As Munger wisely noted, ""You don't make money buying a stock or selling a stock; you make money waiting."" This waiting can be tedious, exasperating, and disheartening at times—just ask any seven-year-old. But just as in childhood, patience in investing ultimately delivers its rewards to those disciplined enough to endure the wait.
When others are consumed by short-term market movements, the investor who has mastered these emotional and analytical principles gains an insurmountable advantage: the ability to think clearly precisely when clarity is most valuable."

TTEK Stock
 
Tetra Tech (NASDAQ: TTEK), an American consulting and engineering services firm, experienced a decline of more than 30% in its stock in less than 30 days by the end of February amid growing market concerns over trade tensions.
Is this dip a buying opportunity? Purchasing during a dip can be a viable strategy for quality stocks when overall market conditions are favorable, provided the stock has a proven history of recovery. In fact, Tetra Tech not only meets basic fundamental quality checks but has also delivered an average return of 56% over one year and achieved a peak return of 61% following past dips.
It has been under one month since TTEK last experienced a drop exceeding 30% within 30 days, and since then, it has recovered by 2.8%. The table below provides details on historical median values:
 
TTEK has experienced two events since 1/1/2020 in which the dip threshold of -30% within 30 days was reached.
 
Evaluating revenue growth, profitability, cash flow, and balance sheet strength is essential to ensure that a dip does not signal a deteriorating business condition.
 
Although dip buying can be appealing, it must be carefully assessed from various perspectives. This multifactor approach is exactly how we develop Trefis portfolio strategies. For a smoother ride compared to individual stocks while still enjoying upside potential, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and achieved returns greater than 91% since its inception.

76,2025-03-11,"The mouse ears are losing their luster on Wall Street.
Disney (DIS+1.31%) stock has slid from $113.80 to $98.44 in less than two weeks, a 13.5% drop.  A drop that steep, that quickly hasn’t occurred since November 2021.
What’s behind the drop? Alice Kassens, professor of economics and director of the Center for Economic Freedom at Roanoke College, blames a shift in consumer confidence.
“It does appear that the current selloff is due to concerns about future consumer spending,” Kasssens says, adding that consumer worries over prices are showing up in reduced consumer sentiment. 
“This measure is important because it is an indicator of current and future consumer spending, which makes up 70% of total spending in the economy,” Kassens says, noting that if consumers continue to cut back, vacations and travel will likely take a hit since those are easier to pull back on than food or necessities. Kassns says the same sentiments are acting as a drag on stock sectors like airlines and hospitality.
Disney’s business faces unique challenges because of its sprawling nature, encompassing theme parks, cruise lines, streaming services, and movies. Despite the slide, though, Fitch Ratings gave Disney a stable A- rating and said in its January analysis:  “Fitch expects the company’s Experiences segment, comprising multiple industry leading theme parks, resorts and cruise lines, to continue to grow and benefit from substantial capital investment over the next ten years.”
On Disney’s most recent earnings call, the company pointed to income at its U.S. theme parks declining 5%, reflecting a 9 percentage-point adverse impact year over year. The company blamed the slump largely on hurricanes Milton and Helene, which pummeled the southeastern U.S. last summer.
But Albert Williams, associate professor of finance at Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, says Disney’s prolonged slide can be pegged to multiple factors.  Williams pointed to Disney’s peak $188.06 in February 2021 to its current price below $100.
“The high prices in 2021 are likely to be related to checks provided by the government during the COVID period. Presently, the ripple effects of these checks have disappeared,” Williams says.
“Also, the traffic to Disney, especially in the summer, has reduced significantly due to the high temperatures,” Williams says, attributing hotter Florida summers to climate change.
And now Disney, which depends on discretionary income more than many businesses, is being buffeted by overall economic uncertainty.
“The impact of the present environment due to the uncertainties of the outcome of the tariff war heating up will have an impact on entertainment. People will save more due to the high level of uncertainty and cut back on vacation,” Williams says, noting that  Disney had also cut back some basic services after COVID.
“This is also negatively  impacting consumer satisfaction,” he adds. “To turn around the situation, Disney should consider a reduction in ticket prices, with no limit on Florida residence, and re-strategize the use of Genie, the Lightning Lane, and the Fast Passes.”

77,2025-03-11,"A new batch of tariffs from President Donald Trump on Tuesday again sent some investors scrambling, as stock indexes tumbled further as the market shudders at economic policy uncertainty.
Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. 
The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks 30 American stalwarts from Apple to Walmart, fell as much as 730 points, or 1.7%, by mid afternoon.
The more broadly spanning S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes were dinged less by the tariff news, as the S&P’s Tuesday loss peaked at 1.5% and the Nasdaq’s drop crested at 1.3%.
The drop followed Trump’s social media announcement that he will increase tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum imports from 25% to 50%.
All three indexes fell Tuesday to their lowest intraday prices since mid September.
Each barometer closed lower in volatile trading Tuesday, as the Dow dropped 480 points, or 1.1%, the S&P declined 0.8% and the Nasdaq inched down 0.2%.
“You’re going to have drops and markets are going to go up and they’re going to go down, but, you know what, we have to rebuild our country,” Trump told reporters Tuesday, referring to the heavy pressure he’s faced as equity prices have faltered thus far during his second term.
The benchmark S&P is on the cusp of entering its first 10% correction since 2023, closing 9.3% below its Feb. 19 all-time high. “10% corrections usually don’t become 20% bear markets unless they’re accompanied by either an economic recession, an earnings recession, or a Fed hiking cycle,” Morgan Stanley Wealth Management strategist Daniel Skelly wrote in emailed comments. “We’re not seeing any of those right now,” Skelly continued.
The world’s most valuable automaker, Tesla, was immune from Tuesday’s slide, as shares of the electric vehicle firm climbed 4%, bouncing slightly from its staggering recent losses. Also rising Tuesday were shares of artificial intelligence giant Nvidia, which declined 23% in the three-week stretch ending Monday.
Nvidia’s and Tesla’s bounce came after the pair headlined Monday’s brutal selloff as the Nasdaq suffered its worst day since 2022, declining 4%. All three major indexes are down significantly since Trump took office in January, and are in the red since he won a second term in November, erasing what were once robust gains. Trump has said to pay little attention to the stock market, while strategists have largely expressed concern at the lack of policy clarity. Trump’s tariffs will worsen inflation and slow economic output, according to Goldman Sachs economists, who raised their probability of a recession in the next year from 15% to 20% last Friday.

78,2025-03-11,"Blooms and Berries Farm Market near Cincinnati has canceled its annual Strawberry Days this year because of a lack of the fruit.
But it's worse for Welch Farms in Chillicothe. The pick-your-own strawberry farm won't have a crop at all this year because it can't get the plants, it said in a Facebook post.
""We are not sure what the future will hold for the industry,"" Welch Farms writes in their post. ""Please say a prayer for all strawberry growers.""
Disease is making it a challenge for Ohio farms to get healthy strawberry plants this year.
Are strawberries going the way of eggs? Due to bird flu, eggs have seen shortages and price increases.
Here's what to know.
Welch Farms ""focuses on providing high quality, fresh strawberries to the local community,"" according to its website. The family-run farm has been growing strawberries since 2005, and allows customers access to the fields so they can pick their own.
On Facebook, Welch Farms wrote that they can't get disease-free strawberry plants this year, so they've decided to not have a crop.
""We want to thank everyone who has supported us over the years,"" the farm wrote. ""[Your] support means more to us than you can know.""
Meanwhile, in the Cincinnati suburb of Loveland, Blooms and Berries Farm Market was forced to cancel its annual Strawberry Days event this year due to a lack of produce.
Last August, Blooms and Berries was set to receive eight acres of strawberry plants, the farm wrote on Facebook, but was informed, ""like thousands of other farms,"" that healthy plants were not available. That forced them to cancel the strawberry event.
""It was, and is, heartbreaking as our community, our team and our family count on the strawberry crop each spring,"" the farm wrote.
In its place, Blooms and Berries will hold Blackberry Days from July 12-20.
“We’ve got to do something fun for our community, for our team, and blackberries was an obvious next choice,” Blooms and Berries' Emily Probst told Fox19. “We’ve done blackberries for several years now, but we’re making an event out of it and shifting our attention this way.”
Welch Farms confirmed in comments on its Facebook post that the strawberry plant shortage is being caused by neopestalotiopsis, which is also called Neo-P. The aggressive fungal infection has hit strawberry growers across the southeast and is spreading, according to media reports.
The fungus, which was first identified in Ohio in 2021, has resulted in significant crop loss in the state, Melanie L. Lewis Ivey, plant pathology professor at the Ohio State University, wrote in the October 2024 newsletter ""Ohio Fruit News,"" produced by the OSU Extension.
""As many strawberry producers are aware, obtaining disease free plants this year has been very challenging,"" Lewis Ivey wrote. ""Nurseries have been canceling orders or have been telling growers that they can purchase plants at their own risk.""
No cultivated varieties of strawberry are resistant to the fungus, she wrote, which has also been identified in blueberries in Ohio and grapevines elsewhere. Neopestalotiopsis spreads rapidly in cool and wet conditions, and infected plants should be destroyed and not composted.
As a result of the fungus, strawberry shortages are expected this year, Lewis Ivey said in an email Monday. Many growers have reduced their strawberry plantings or are not planting at all.
Greenhouses are equally at risk, she said. Since their strawberry plantings are sourced from the same supplies as field growers, they pose the same risk of a reduced supply.
And, like with eggs, shoppers will likely see higher strawberry prices because of it.
""Due to these shortages, berry prices are likely to rise,"" Lewis Ivey said Monday, ""and U-pick operations may not open.""
The avian flu strain H5N1, first identified in the U.S. in late 2021, has led to the death of millions of egg-laying chickens in the U.S., including more than eight million in Ohio — either from infection or culling of flocks, USA TODAY reports. It has sickened more than 65 people over the past year and led to the death of one Louisiana resident in January.
Because of it, egg prices have continued to rise, with the average price of a dozen large Grade A eggs hitting an all-time high in the U.S. in January, up 15% to $4.95, according to NerdWallet, citing data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
And that price is expected to climb even higher. The U.S. Department of Agriculture recently released a report predicting egg prices will increase 41.1% this year, per USA TODAY."

The White House, Washington, DC
Over the years, I have learned to focus on earnings, interest rates and other market factors when assessing the outlook for stocks, and to avoid letting the Washington DC political scene impact investment decisions. While I believe this has served me well for decades, perhaps the first time in my career I may rethink that philosophy.
Wall Street prefers to know what the playing field looks like regarding, trade, taxes, policy, as well as the outlook for corporate earnings and interest rates. With so much uncertainty out of Washington DC these outlooks have become less visible. Even The Federal Reserve Board Chairman, Jerome Powell has said the policy uncertainty is putting The Fed in a ‘wait and see’ mode.
Re: Trade, the daily tariff threat is adding confusion to long term investment decisions. While employing more Americans in industries like autos is a noteworthy objective (along with reducing the flow of fentanyl which is another stated reason for the tariff threat), there also needs to be a realization that building a factory to make the cars takes years along with tens of millions of dollars. Companies just don’t decide to move production and jobs in a matter of weeks or months. Retaliatory tariffs are also going to be a reality and despite what we hear, tariffs are inflationary. My hope is that this becomes evident to the current administration, and we will have a reduction in the daily tariff threats and develop a less provocative foreign agenda.
Re: Taxes, Congress needs to pass a tax bill as the current law is set to expire. Companies need clarity upon which to make long-term investment decisions. With the House narrowly split, this is not a certainty especially with issues like the SALT deduction dividing Republicans.
Re: Policy, the reduction in government waste is welcome by many, and just about every President in my lifetime has spoken out about it. And when Bill Clinton cut about 300,000 government positions, he didn’t send shock waves through the economy. For many, and for Wall Street, the issue isn’t whether government needs to be more efficient, it’s about how to do it without dramatically impacting the labor market. Sizable layoffs in a slowing economy can add pressure to an already slowing economy.
These issues, as well as the continuation of wars and delicate discussions with friends and foes alike, are all casting a pall over stock prices. Despite the gloom, we believe that earnings and interest rates will resume their rightful place as the two biggest factors impacting stocks. Until then, we will likely see more unpredictability and stock market volatility.
Since politicians generally don’t like to be the cause of market downturns, we expect even this administration to tone things down a bit. If and hopefully when that happens, we may see a rebound in stock prices. The current decline in interest rates supports this optimism and the more favorable stock valuations as a result of this correction also support the notion that stocks are more attractively priced than they were a few months ago.
When things are rocky it can be beneficial to remember the words of Warren Buffett: “Be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy.”"

Some Meta women employees formed a secret Facebook group in 2017 to talk about their workplace, according to a former group member, a new book claims.

        Nearly 200 female employees who worked under then-chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg joined the group, called the ""Feminist Fight Club,"" wrote Sarah Wynn-Williams. Meta had 17,048 employees at the end of 2016, according to its annual report.
    

        Wynn-Williams, a former global public policy director at Meta, then called Facebook, published a memoir Tuesday about her six years at the company, which includes a chapter on the group.
    

        The ""Feminist Fight Club"" encouraged employees to be more open about ""systemic issues"" women faced, including sexual harassment from men in leadership, Wynn-Williams wrote.
    

        She wrote that the group was created after women took notice of Sandberg's silence around the Women's March, a large-scale women's protest against Donald Trump and the patriarchy in 2017. Sandberg, the highest-ranking woman at Meta, did not attend any march or post about the subject, the Washington Post wrote at the time. Her absence was notable: Sandberg, who wrote the bestselling book ""Lean In"" to encourage women to advocate for themselves in the workplace, was viewed as a global advocate for women.
    

        She later told tech journalist Kara Swisher that while an event precluded her attendance, she regretted her lack of posts.
    

        Wynn-Williams wrote that she was relieved to know that she was not the only one surprised by Sandberg's seeming lack of interest in the Womens's March.
    

        She described an episode on a private jet on their way back from Davos, Switzerland, in which she and Sandberg's assistant repeatedly raise the matter of the Women's March but were ignored. Instead, Sandberg talked about her weekend plans and her boyfriend and showed a keen interest in what first lady Melania Trump wore to the inauguration.
    

        Sandberg left Meta in 2022 and said she would focus on philanthropy.
    

        The ""Feminist Fight Club"" eventually made ""enough noise"" that Meta's management noticed and devised a solution to reward colleagues for being allies to women, Wynn-Williams wrote.
    

        The company responded with the #ally bot, to be used by men to credit other men supporting women. The bot doled out badges that people could put on their internal Facebook profile and were connected to Meta's performance reviews.
    

        ""Men will be receiving a highly visible input to the system that will affect pay, promotions, and stock options and can be easily gamed by any men who decide to hand each other #ally hashtags,"" Wynn-Williams wrote.
    

        The bot was not received well by the ""Feminist Fight Club,"" who saw it as a way to ""incentivize and reward men and not women."" One woman posted: ""Doesn't it seem like this is an undue amount of credit for men who are hitting the bare minimum of decency?""
    

        It's not clear how widely the bot was used or if it was discontinued.
    

        Meta and Sandberg did not respond to requests for comment. Metaspokesman Andy Stone called the book ""a mix of old claims and false accusations about our executives"" and said Wynn-Williams was fired for poor performance and behavior.

Smart wearables

The global smartwatch market experienced its first ever decline in 2024, falling by 7% compared to the previous year. Apple maintained its first position but experienced a significant 19% reduction in shipments. Huawei secured second place with a 35% surge in shipments thanks to a strong Chinese market and a diverse portfolio, ranging from basic wearables, kids' smartwatches, and advanced offerings.
Samsung was third with a modest 3% increase in shipments thanks to the Galaxy Watch7 and Galaxy Watch Ultra lineups. Xiaomi's 2024 smartwatch year was strong with a 135% jump in yearly shipments.
The main reason for the global market decline was the Indian market, where consumer demand diminished due to a slow replacement cycle, lack of innovation, and unsatisfactory user experiences among first-time buyers.
On the other hand, the Chinese market was the biggest global market for the first time. It grew by 6% year-over-year, recording its highest ever shipments. Huawei, Imoo (formerly BKK), and Xiaomi were the frontrunners.
The market is expected to slowly recover in 2025 on the heels of increased AI integration and advanced health monitoring in future smartwatches.

It's not a matter of looks, they ARE more powerful, both hardware and software. 
Chinese brands have a major downside outside China, they are still unable to perform NFC payments seamlessly. Some have tried payment processor workarounds such as...
I bought every Samsung Smart Watch model up until Galaxy Watch 6 Classic 47mm. The price for Galaxy Watch Ultra was 5.75 times more than the previous one. The price now is 3 times more. It's still very high....
See, atleast in India if they could provide a small camera and hence UPI facilities, these watches could be the next bug thing.

85,2025-03-11,"Xiaomi once again undercuts Samsung by a considerable amount in India. 

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Xiaomi is onto a winner with the 15 Ultra; I used the phone for well over a month, and it is absolutely fantastic. There's a new design that makes it easier to hold and use, a bigger battery, the same great 1-inch main camera as last year but with a new 200MP tele lens that takes outstanding portraits alongside 4.3x zoom, and the latest available hardware. Xiaomi debuted the device globally at Mobile World Congress, and the 15 Ultra is now making its way to India, where it is sold in a single 16GB/512GB model that costs ₹109,999 ($1,259). As always, Xiaomi India is incentivizing the launch by providing freebies — including the excellent photography kit that's bundled with all pre-orders. The phone is ₹10,000 costlier than the 14 Ultra in India, and that's understandable when you look at all the upgrades. Even then, it is a considerable bargain when you consider the same phone is sold in the U.K. for £1,499 ($1,932), and other countries in the region for €1,499 ($1,627). Xiaomi has always been aggressive when it comes to India, and that's the case with the 15 Ultra as well, and if you're interested in the phone, India is the best country to pick it up. I'd argue that it's better to buy the 15 Ultra in India than China — even though it's more affordable in Xiaomi's home market — because the Indian model comes with the Play Store and all Google services out of the box.

Best of all, the Xiaomi 15 Ultra undercuts the Galaxy S25 Ultra and Pixel 9 Pro XL in India. The Galaxy S25 Ultra costs ₹141,999 ($1,626) in the country for the 16GB/512GB edition, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL is ₹139,999 ($1,603) for the 512GB option. Although the 15 Ultra costs more than last year, it is still the best value (as it were) if you want a high-end phone in India, and there's also the fact that it has the absolute best camera package of any device today. As I noted in my Xiaomi 15 Ultra vs. Galaxy S25 Ultra post, Xiaomi managed to deliver a better overall product than Samsung this year, and the icing on the cake is that the phone costs less in India. In every other region, the 15 Ultra is being sold at a premium over the S25 Ultra, so it's clear that Xiaomi is intent on gaining a foothold in the premium segment in India. Xiaomi also debuted the regular Xiaomi 15 in India, and like last year, it does a good job going up against the likes of the OnePlus 13. Although Xiaomi does really well in the budget and now mid-range categories, it hasn't really made a dent in the high-end, and it will be aiming to change that with the 15 Ultra and Xiaomi 15.


Xiaomi once again delivers one of the best camera packages with the 15 Ultra, and the rest of the phone is pretty great too.

MT Stock
 
ArcelorMittal has experienced an increase in its stock by almost 50% over the past six months, compared to a 5% gain in the S&P 500 Index. ArcelorMittal’s stock has risen much more sharply than that of its peers, including VALE (NYSE: VALE) which has declined by 4% over the past six months, Cleveland-Cliffs which has fallen 11% during the same period, United States Steel Corporation which has increased by 13% in the last six months, and Nucor Corp (NYSE: NUE) which has dropped 6% over the same period.
The rise in ArcelorMittal’s stock is primarily due to the company reporting better-than-expected earnings for Q4 2024. The steel giant recorded adjusted earnings of $0.52 per share, and revenue of $14.71 billion. Although revenue fell by 3% in Q4 compared to the previous quarter, the market responded favorably to the earnings and ArcelorMittal’s ongoing decarbonization initiatives, which investors view as a long-term value driver. Additionally, the company remains optimistic about global steel demand, particularly outside China, with anticipated growth between 2.5% and 3.5% in 2025​.
  We estimate MT stock at approximately $30 per share, roughly 10% below the current market price. Notably, the stock is at levels similar to those in late 2022. Furthermore, if you are seeking potential upside with a smoother ride than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and delivered over 91% returns since its inception.
Part of the stock’s rise over the past six months can be attributed to an approximate 55% growth in ArcelorMittal’s earnings per share, which increased from $1.10 in 2023 to $1.70 in 2024. Although revenue growth surged in 2021 and 2022, it was more subdued in 2023 and 2024 due to lower steel prices.
Although ArcelorMittal has experienced inconsistent revenue growth in recent years, its price-to-sales (P/S) multiple has increased. The company’s P/S multiple rose from 0.27 in 2020 to 0.34 in 2023. Now, with a P/S of 0.44, there is a potential downside when compared to previous levels of 0.38 at the end of 2021 and 0.27 at the end of 2022.
The growth in MT stock over the past four years has been quite inconsistent, with annual returns exhibiting greater volatility than the S&P 500. The stock delivered returns of 40% in 2021, -16% in 2022, 10% in 2023, and -17% in 2024. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, which comprises 30 stocks, has been much less volatile and has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over this four-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided better returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index – offering a smoother ride, as demonstrated inHQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment—with rate cuts and multiple conflicts—could MT face a similar scenario as in 2023 and 2024 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months, or will it experience a strong surge?
ArcelorMittal has demonstrated robust recent performance, driven by an optimistic outlook for steel demand in 2025. The company reported an EBITDA of $1.65 billion for Q4. Although its full-year operating profit declined to $7.05 billion from $8.74 billion in 2023, the EBITDA per tonne remained well above pre-COVID levels despite economic challenges. Furthermore, ArcelorMittal expects global steel consumption (excluding China) to increase by 2.5% to 3.5% in 2025, spurred by restocking and higher demand. Capital expenditures are projected to remain between $4.5 billion and $5 billion, with significant investments in Brazil, India, and the United States. Additionally, the company plans to return at least 50% of its post-dividend free cash flow to shareholders through share buybacks.

90,2025-03-11,"CNN's Anderson Cooper played a video compilation of Trump during the campaign season claiming stock market would collapse like 1929 if he did not win the 2024 election.
How's that working out for the country?
COOPER: But repeatedly on the campaign trail, Trump warned a Democratic victory would lead to a decline in markets.

TRUMP: If Harris wins this election, you will quickly have a Kamala economic crash. You're going to have a crash.
If we lose, you're going to have a crash like you wouldn't believe.

COOPER: He also said the only way to avoid a market crash would be to elect him. In fact, one line he used repeatedly throughout much of 2024.
TRUMP: Did you see that? Their stock market crashed when we won. Many people say that the only reason the stock market is up is because people think I am going to win.
And we are a nation whose stock market's continued success is totally contingent on MAGA winning the next election.
We are a nation whose stock market's continued success is contingent on MAGA winning the next election.
If we don't win the next election, the stock market will crash just like it did in 1929.

Any honest broker of information would've predicted that Trump's obsession with yo-yo tariffs would have a disastrous effect on Wall Street.
This is what happens when billionaires run the country. They'll never have a clue about the pain they cause the working class because it never affects them.

Is this a surprise to anyone?
This seems to have been pitched as ""it was secret"", and ""Zuck was building censorship apparatus"". Meta has since said it was public about wanting to operate in China (I don't remember, but I'll take them at their word - you'd be more surprised if they weren't). As for building censorship apparatus, that's mandatory if you want to play in China.
Taking the car analogy, if you want to sell cars in (say) China, you have to make them left hand drive. Well, duh, of course you do. You want to sell there, you play by their rules. You might think those rules to be abhorrent, but those are the rules - take it or leave it.
So all in all, I don't really see what the fuss is about. Zuck's still a dick, but we all knew that already.
Exactly, it was never a secret that Facebook, now Meta, wanted to operate in China.  I remember more than decade ago listening to commentary about how they were trying to come up with some way they could operate there that would not been seen as going to far to help the CCP oppress.
China is also the kinda place where if you break the rules you local people could find a bag over their heads. So as you say it is take it or leave it; its not trying and see how big the fines are in court. This is challenge beca 
Facebook did operate in China. Why do people think it didn't? They were booted out for supporting terrorists in Xinjiang.When they were no longer useful to China, Pooh Bear altered the deal. This is my surprised face.

Everyone who wants to publish in China works hand in glove with the Chinese government. Unlike so many others, Facebook ultimately concluded that they couldn't meet the government's requirements without compromising their product and abandoned the effort.
I just assumed this was going on, and I'm pretty sure just about everyone who thought about it and wasn't born yesterday had the same assumption.
Also, TFA says ""Ms Williams -- who makes the claims in a new book -- has also filed a whistleblower complaint with the US markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), alleging Meta misled investors."" Given the current 'regulatory' environment in the US - and all the other political shit that's going on there - I think it's safe to say that complaint will go straight into the circular file and never see the light of day. After all, the folks who bought the election will insist on getting their money's worth.
Well that would depend on when the whistleblower complaint was filed, wouldn't it?
Or are you just so desperate to bothsides everything because the current administration is a pathetic joke of ignorance, incompetence, stubbornness, and betrayal?
I would imagine this was true in the Biden administration too?She left Facebook in 2017, so her inside information is about Facebook's activities in 2017 and earlier.

This was a subject many years ago when Zuck actually names one of his kids after Xi.
It was pretty obvious why, as he was desperately trying to get into PRC market at that time.
Source ? Common wisdom is that Mark Zuckerberg's 3 kids are named Maxima, August, and Aurelia,
Makes me wonder if the family does ""roman salutes"" to each other...
He named one of his kids Winnie the Pooh?
Facebook worked with $COUNTRY to set $POLICY for their $SOCIAL_NORMS. ...and???
Musk buying twitter exposed what Facebook (and other social media) was doing at the behest of the deep state, arguably a far more evil clique of people than CCP.
Sounds like vengeful hearsay from a disgruntled former employee.  Doesn't mean its automatically false, and you'd have to be stupid to actually TRUST Meta in any case, but I'm taking this with a healthy salt dose.
I thought China has its own popular social network services.

As markets continued their downward spiral Monday, many are wondering: Is the U.S. heading into a recession?
A key data point is a model from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta that predicts GDP will shrink by an annualized rate of -2.4% this quarter. Then there are other signs, like tanking consumer sentiment and surging layoff announcements.
Still, there’s plenty of evidence that a downturn isn’t necessarily imminent. As recently as summer 2023, Goldman Sachs predicted more than a 30% chance of a recession, right before the U.S. saw seven consecutive quarters of more than 1.5% GDP growth.

Wall Street extended its brutal losses on Monday, with all three major U.S. stock indexes closing at their lowest prices in months after President Donald Trump declined to rule out a recession in a Fox News interview over the weekend. The Nasdaq is in correction territory after falling 13% from its closing price on February 19, the S&P 500 is down 9% during that period, and the Dow is down 6%.
Tesla officially erased what was once a 91% post-election gain Monday, as shares of the electric vehicle maker declined more than 15% amid the stock market’s broader losses. It was the seventh-worst day in the company’s 15-year trading history, as a note from UBS analyst Joseph Spak called for the firm’s 2025 vehicle deliveries to decline by 5%.
MORE: In a Fox Business interview Monday, Elon Musk was asked how he is running his other businesses while simultaneously dedicating time to politics and DOGE. The billionaire said he’s doing so “with great difficulty,” but did not provide specifics for how he is running Tesla, SpaceX or xAI.
Tariff and economic uncertainty is sending gas prices down, with the average price falling to $3.03 per gallon, according to GasBuddy. That’s the lowest average price for the month of March in four years, as oil prices are closely linked with the state of the economy: If fewer people travel and buy goods, demand for oil could fall.

China has a new richest man, according to Forbes’ estimates: Zhang Yiming, cofounder of TikTok parent company ByteDance, whose fortune has grown to $65.5 billion. The 41-year-old Zhang, who stepped down as chairman of the privately held tech giant in 2021, derives his net worth from a 21% stake in the firm. Forbes estimates that ByteDance has a valuation of $312 billion.
MORE: The Trump Administration says it is in talks with four groups interested in purchasing TikTok, with the president indicating “there could be” a deal for the app’s sale soon. Still, any sale would require China’s approval, and tensions between Beijing and Washington have risen sharply in the past few weeks, as Trump has moved to enforce 20% tariffs on all imports from China.
Graphitic Energy is opening a pilot plant in San Antonio, Texas, to make clean hydrogen and graphite.
Although the federal climate for clean energy has shifted, one startup is generating the universe’s most abundant element, hydrogen, in an affordable and clean way that doesn’t need any help from Uncle Sam. California-based Graphitic Energy, which has raised $65 million, extracts hydrogen and carbon molecules from natural gas using a relatively small amount of electricity. In the process, it produces valuable graphite, which can sell for more than $2,500 a metric ton and is primarily produced in China.

Congress must pass a new spending bill by Friday to avoid a government shutdown, as President Donald Trump encouraged Republicans to unify behind a GOP-backed resolution that would largely keep current fiscal year 2024 funding levels in place until the end of September. Republicans can only afford to lose one vote in the House if all Democrats vote against it, and at least one House Republican has vowed not to support the bill.
Ontario will place a 25% surcharge on electricity flowing into the U.S. starting next week, the province’s Premier Doug Ford said Monday—the latest retaliatory measure in response to Trump’s tariffs on Canada. The surcharge will primarily impact Minnesota, Michigan and New York, and Ford said it will cost homes and businesses in the states $277,000 daily, or $69 a month for the average American household.
A federal judge ruled that Elon Musk’s DOGE must release records about its operation, as it is likely covered under the Freedom of Information Act—a major win for watchdog groups. The judge, who said DOGE’s operations were being carried out with “unusual secrecy,” rejected the argument that the agency was an arm of the president's executive office, saying that its records must be subject to the transparency law.
Rodrigo Duterte, the former president of the Philippines, was arrested in the country’s capital of Manila on Tuesday after the International Criminal Court issued a warrant against him as part of an investigation into accusations of crimes against humanity related to the former leader’s deadly war on drugs. In 2022, the Philippine government disclosed that a total of 6,252 people were killed during Duterte's “antidrug operations,” although the Human Rights Watch believes the number to be much higher.
ILLUSTRATION BY EMILY SCHERER FOR FORBES
TOPLINE DOGE’s cost-cutting efforts have already targeted the IRS, and reports have spread about cutting the agency’s workforce by as much as half. But Forbes’ Kelly Phillips Erb, a tax attorney, recently volunteered in Alaska as part of an effort to help residents prepare their tax returns for free, and she writes that it demonstrates why taxpayer service isn’t a frill.
The Alaska volunteer effort is run by the tax-exempt Alaska Business Development Center in concert with the American Bar Association Section of Taxation, getting help from the IRS’ Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) grant program. For the 2025 fiscal year, the IRS awarded $53 million in such grants to 315 VITA organizations and 41 groups participating in a sister program, Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE). In 2023, grant recipients from the programs helped taxpayers file more than 2.1 million tax returns. 
Whether the looming IRS budget cuts will leave room to support taxpayer services like VITA and TCE is an open question.
Many families would not have been able to file their taxes without VITA volunteers. While some owed taxes, many others were filing to receive a refund. Former IRS Commissioner John Koskinen often said that the refund due to some taxpayers is one of the largest checks they receive all year.
Often, families who qualify for those credits and refunds can’t afford to engage a paid preparer—or if they do, their refund may be eaten up by fees. That’s where VITA volunteers make a big difference, since they can prepare most Form 1040 returns.
WHY IT MATTERS “Our tax system can be complicated,” says Phillips Erb. “And many families may face situations that are too complicated for DIY software, and they cannot afford—or, as in some parts of the country like rural Alaska, may not be able to find—a qualified tax preparer near them to help file their taxes.”
“So, why should those taxpayers who don’t directly benefit from VITA care about the program? The U.S. income tax system is built on voluntary compliance—nearly 85% of taxpayers file and pay on time each year. Programs like VITA make it easier for taxpayers to keep those numbers up and our tax gap down. That’s good for everyone.”

The U.S. is seeing far fewer Canadians cross the U.S. border by car—less than half of what was predicted for February—setting the stage for billions in economic losses this year. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau urged citizens to reconsider visiting the U.S. after President Donald Trump levied tariffs on the country:
23%: The drop in the number of Canadians taking road trips into the U.S. last month compared to February 2024
$20.5 billion: The amount Canadian visitors, the largest group of foreign inbound tourists to the U.S., spent last year
More than $4 billion: The amount the U.S. economy could lose in 2025 if there is a sustained decline of more than 20% in Canadian visitors, according to the U.S. Travel Association

In addition to running a marketing agency with customers around the globe and a seven-figure local business, today’s master is also a kickboxing champion and MMA fighter — making Jennifer Waters easily the marketer I’d least like to fight.
Though Flo from Progressive seems like she’d be a scrapper, right? It’s not just me?

But rather than spend our time arguing about which mascot would win in the octagon, today she’s here to teach you how to kill it… in small and local business marketing that is. But don’t worry; you SMB and enterprise marketers will get your kicks in, too.

“To survive as a local business, you need to think and market like a Fortune 500 company,” Waters says.
If that reflexively made your wallet pucker, you can relax. She means that you need to think bigger than just a few scattered Facebook ads.
“You need to do what I call omnipresence marketing. Digital marketing is just one arm of it,” Waters explains.
So while omnichannel refers to coordinating your marketing across all of your digital channels, omnipresence means you include the real world. In fact, Waters says the foundation of small-business marketing is live events.
“This is where you’re out shakin’ hands and kissin’ babies,” she smiles.
For a karate school, this might be hosting a monthly parents’ night out. For a florist, it could be weekly wine-and-design classes. (As a real-life example, the kung fu school I go to hosts a monthly classic kung fu movie night.) The exact details will differ, but the goals are the same: generating leads and building visibility.
“We want to be physically present in the community. We want to have internal events to bring people to us, to generate publicity. And because your name is constantly out there you become category king or category queen with your local business.”
Meanwhile, as your digital marketing promotes these live events, your live events provide fodder for your digital marketing. And when you coordinate them both? Voilà! Omnipresence.

Because I’m a massive dork, I can’t resist asking the cheese question: What do martial arts masters know that marketers need to learn?
Waters’ answer is anything but cheese.
“Relationships are everything,” she says. “Your relationship to the individual customer, or in this case to your martial arts student, is what is going to keep them coming back. Or feeling comfortable referring other people to you.”
Every touchpoint you have with your audience — at live events, on social media, on your website, on the phone — is a chance to build that relationship.
Imagine you see a great video ad, so you call up the company and… some rude jerk answers the phone.
“All that marketing did nothing because the relationship wasn’t there.”
This is a good time to take stock: When you reply to your emails, are you maintaining that relationship? Are you proactively reaching out to customers who talk about you on social media? When they land on your homepage, are they getting the same vibe they can expect at your live events?

For Waters, the current era of marketing is all about asking, “What can we do to get this person to stop?”
Stop scrolling and watch your video. Stop clearing the inbox and read your newsletter. Stop walking and check out your booth at your local fair.
“If I’m going out in person, I’m not going in plain clothes. I’m going to throw on a karate gi and now I’m stopping traffic.”
“If I was advising a chef who was trying to get people to come over and taste the pastries, I’d say put on a chef’s outfit with the hat and everything,” she gestures at an imaginary toque like Ratatouille.
And the same principle applies online; you just have to figure out the digital equivalent of your gi. Waters notes that, since they’re still new and novel to most folks, dropping AI-generated images into your social feed is a good way to get people to stop scrolling.
The key is figuring out what makes your unique business stand out both online and off.
Now, get out there and don your gi apparel.
What's a career you've always wanted to get into but never have?—Eric Munn, Director of marketing, Chicago Transit Authority
Waters says: “Honestly, I always wanted to do what I'm doing today! No other careers I would want to have!”
And, when you cruise her resume — champion martial artist, multiple belt-holder, thriving small business owner, agency co-founder who gets to help other small businesses thrive every day — yeah, that’s a fair answer. 
Waters asks: “What’s one marketing mechanism that will generate the most revenue quickly for a startup?”

97,2025-03-11,"US electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Tesla saw its value slashed by some 15% on Monday, as part of a massive US stock market sell-off on March 10 that came after President Donald Trump refused to rule out a recession.
Several major indexes slumped, with big tech emerging as the biggest loser.
For Elon Musk’s EV brainchild, Monday’s bloodbath marked its biggest loss in a single day since 2020. Tesla’s woes, however, did not start overnight. The automaker’s share has slid by 50% - representing more than $800 billion in market value - since its December peak.
Speaking to Bloomberg, Michael Rosen, chief investment officer of Angeles Investment Advisors, attributed the market turmoil to Trump’s efforts to “break the international economic regime, presumably with a plan to fix and replace it with something better.”
“Absent a clear idea of what ‘better’ is, investors are just left with the detritus of the broken global economic framework. Unless and until we see what replaces it, investors will be cautious, at best,” he predicted.
Trump refused to explicitly rule out that the US economy is headed for a recession, during an interview with Fox News over the weekend, saying that “there is a period of transition because what we’re doing is very big.”
However, he official expressed confidence that in the end, “it should be great for us.”
Last month Trump announced 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, along with 10% duties on Chinese goods. While Trump has since granted several reprieves, Ottawa has nevertheless retaliated with tariffs of its own, as has Beijing.
As for Tesla, aside from the continuous slump in value, it has recently become the target of multiple protests, and even arson attacks on its dealerships.
In a post on X on Monday, Musk pointed the finger at ActBlue, a major Democratic fundraising platform funded by billionaire George Soros among other sponsors.
Trump posted a message in support of the electric car manufacturer on his TruthSocial platform on Tuesday, accusing “Radical Left Lunatics” of “trying to illegally and collusively boycott Tesla.”
“I’m going to buy a brand new Tesla tomorrow morning as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk,” the US president wrote.

In mid-January, ahead of a Supreme Court ruling on TikTok's future in the US, employees at the company focused on another task: filling out their performance reviews.

        These evaluations had become particularly anxiety-inducing for some of the company's 7,000-plus US staffers after it instructed managers last year to grade workers more strictly. A low score on a review could lead to a smaller bonus or a performance-improvement plan.
    

Uncertainty about the company's path, combined with fear that they would personally receive negative reviews, made some staffers feel directionless and burned out.
    

        ""I see people change from motivated to, 'I don't care anymore,'"" one current TikTok employee told Business Insider.
    

        TikTok has been placing high demands on its employees as political scrutiny of the company heats up over its owner's ties to China, 10 current and former employees who have worked at the company in the past year told BI. These US staffers spoke on condition of anonymity to protect their jobs and career prospects; their identities are known to BI.
    

        Some of the workplace pressure is specific to TikTok, but it also reflects a broader trend in the tech industry. Companies such as Meta, Google, and Microsoft have targeted low performers, cut workplace perks, and cracked down on employee dissent in the pursuit of business efficiency.
    

        The trade-off for workplace pressure is high pay and working at the buzziest companies in tech.
    

        ""From a career growth standpoint, you have access to huge budgets and big names,"" a former staffer said of working at TikTok. ""Everyone in the industry wants to talk to you.""
    

        Still, burnout can take a real human toll, as well as impact a company's operations and bottom line.
    

        The TikTok staffers who spoke with BI said they felt that burnout — defined by the World Health Organization as workplace stress that has not been successfully managed — had become common.
    

        Some employees are addressing burnout by requesting time off for mental health leave, five of the current and former employees said. These staffers worked on three different teams across several offices and spoke directly with colleagues who had taken mental health leave or had done so themselves.
    

        BI was unable to obtain data on how many TikTok employees had used mental health leave, and the company did not respond to requests for comment. But interviews with current and former staffers made clear that mental health — and taking time off for it — had been a topic of discussion among the workforce over the past year.
    

        ""We all talked,"" another former TikTok employee said. ""We all side texted. And we all found out pretty quickly whether people were on leave because of burnout.""
    

        The former staffer said there was a period when about 20% of their team was out on mental health leave. While TikTok doesn't broadcast why a worker goes on leave, the staffer was told directly by colleagues that they were taking time off for their mental health. A second current staffer said they had direct knowledge of six employees who had requested mental health leave.
    

        The length of leave depended on the person and the state where they lived, but several of the TikTok insiders said two to three months of paid time off was typical. When a staffer goes on leave, their away status and period of time off are typically displayed in internal communication tools to alert colleagues that they are unreachable, without specifying the reason, three current and former employees told BI.
    

        Some employees chose to go on leave because they were exhausted and needed a break after feeling intense pressure to hit their goals, said three of the TikTok insiders, who had either spoken with team members who took time off or gone on leave themselves.
    

        The first former staffer described a moment last year when their team reorganized under new leadership and saw expectations around performance spike.
    

        ""It didn't make sense to me,"" they said. ""If you have ambitious goals, you need more head count, tooling, and software.""
    

        As performance targets increased, stress followed, a third former staffer said.
    

        ""For me, it was just feeling like a failure, like I couldn't do anything right,"" said the ex-employee, who went on mental health leave while at the company. BI viewed a confirmation email sent to the employee to verify they had been approved for the leave.
    

        TikTok isn't the only tech company dealing with burnout, which has become increasingly common across the sector. Mental health leave is also on the rise in the US workforce. In a 2024 survey of US business executives and human resources professionals conducted by the law firm Littler Mendelson, 74% of respondents said they saw an increase in ""employee requests for leaves of absence or accommodations for mental health-related issues over the last year.""
    

        But TikTok faces unique challenges compared with other US workplaces. For one, its app could shut down in the US in April if it fails to reach a political resolution with the Trump administration. While TikTok has assured US staffers that they would still have jobs even if its app got kicked out of the country, the company rarely addresses its political challenges internally. That's added to overall anxiety, six of the current and former employees told BI.
    

        ""The uncertainty is certainly playing a major role in burnout in the sense that we don't know if we're going to have jobs,"" the second current employee said.
    

        That said, for some staff, dealing with challenging performance standards and the threat of having the business shut down by the US government is worth it for the opportunity to work at a fast-growing company that's reshaping the tech industry. And not everyone at TikTok faces the same pressure to perform, seven of the current and former staffers said.
    

        ""I think depending on the team, there has been a more tense environment, but at the same time, I also know plenty of teams where that is not the case,"" the first current employee said.
    

        TikTok provides various mental health resources to staff, including therapy sessions via a platform called Lyra Health.
    

        TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance, are known for testing many ideas and then pivoting based on what works or flops. Leaders at TikTok sometimes talk about this approach as ""building the plane while flying it,"" a current employee and two former staffers told BI.
    

        As part of that startup ethos, the company regularly reorganizes or lays off teams, changes employees' performance goals, and adds new policies like mandatory return-to-office for some teams.
    

        Some employees said that frequent changes to how they worked, whether it was abruptly getting a new manager or seeing their goals change, made their jobs feel insecure.
    

        ""The joke internally was don't get too comfortable because something was going to change,"" the second former staffer said.
    

        As part of the reorgs, some new team leaders either worked out of China (where ByteDance is headquartered) and required late calls from US teams, or migrated from abroad to work in US offices, seven of the current and former staffers told BI. Managers like Bob Kang and Qing Lan worked on the Chinese version of TikTok, Douyin, before taking on leadership roles at TikTok in e-commerce and advertising for small and midsize businesses, for example.
    

        Several of the new executives raised the performance targets for their teams or implemented policies that increased time at work, such as return-to-office requirements, the seven TikTok insiders said. The TikTok Shop team, under Kang's leadership, recently intensified a return-to-office rule that required employees to be in the office five days a week, specifying that they would need to be physically in the office space for eight hours a day, for instance.
    

        ""They have been consolidating under Chinese leadership to some extent,"" the first current staffer said, referring to Chinese staff coming to the US.
    

        In a December court filing, TikTok said that its US platform was controlled by US employees, subsidiaries, and contractors but that its recommendation algorithm was developed by a global team.
    

        Other former employees, such as Chloe Shih and Pabel Martinez, have previously raised concerns about the intensity of the company's work culture.
    

        The focus on working long hours isn't new to the Chinese tech scene. Tech firms like ByteDance built massive businesses in the country as part of a ""996"" work culture, which asked employees to work 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week (a practice that's now illegal in China). Even as ByteDance has pledged to work a ""1075"" schedule — 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., five days a week — there remains a sense among some US employees that their Chinese colleagues are constantly working.
    

        ""There were a lot of leaders that came in from ByteDance or the China-based teams, and they operated so differently,"" a fourth former employee said. ""There was a cultural perspective that the US and outside of China just doesn't work as fast as China.""
    

        The pressure to always be available can have an impact on burnout.
    

        ""People are not machines, and giving them breaks to recharge, to think differently, helps our employees be more creative,"" Jaclyn Margolis, an associate professor who researches organizational behavior at Pepperdine University's Graziadio Business School, told BI.
    

        Failure to address burnout can lead to absenteeism and turnover, said Laura Giurge, an assistant professor at the London School of Economics and Political Science.
    

        The economic impact of burnout in the workplace can be sizable. A study published this year in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine estimated that employee disengagement and burnout cost US companies between $3,999 and $20,683 a year per disengaged staffer, depending on the level of seniority.
    

        While working at TikTok can be grueling for some US employees, the company also pays its staff competitively — a key perk. A BI analysis of work-visa disclosures from late 2024 found that with a few exceptions, most of the company's base salary offers were in the six figures in the US.
    

        Fear of losing a high salary acts as a form of ""golden handcuffs"" for TikTok employees, the third former staffer said.
    

        There's also no guarantee that leaving TikTok for a competitor would reduce workplace stress, as other Big Tech firms have also increased pressure on staff as part of an efficiency push in the industry.
    

        Even if an employee wants to jump ship, it may be tough to land a new gig, as the tech job market is very tight. As of February, US software development job postings were about 36.5% below their prepandemic levels, data compiled by the jobs site Indeed showed.
    

        Allison Shrivastava, an economist with the Indeed Hiring Lab, said there's uncertainty in the job market and quit rates are very low.
    

        ""The tech scene elsewhere has been really rough,"" a third current employee said, ""feeling kind of stuck.""
    

        And for the thousands of employees working in TikTok's US offices, the issue of job security is particularly heightened as we approach April 5, the deadline for TikTok to make a deal that appeases Washington. A divest-or-ban law, which the Supreme Court upheld as constitutional, has targeted ByteDance's ties to China. Without additional government intervention, TikTok could disappear from app stores and cease operating in less than a month.
    

        ""Sometimes people wonder why we are doing this job, because in a few weeks, it may no longer be relevant,"" the first current staffer said.
