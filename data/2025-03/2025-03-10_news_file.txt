Elon Musk remained the wealthiest person in the world even after losing $29 billion on Monday alone.

        Musk was worth $301 billion as of Monday evening, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which updated to reflect stock values as of market close. Musk's net worth on Sunday was $330 billion, meaning it fell 6.7% on Monday.
    

        The net worth drop was fueled by a decline in Tesla's stock price. Tesla's stock fell 15% on Monday, marking its biggest single-day decline since September 2020. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 was down 4% overall while the S&P 500 was down 3%.
    

        Tesla stock is down 55% from its high in December. Musk's net worth is down $132 billion, or more than 30%, this year, according to Bloomberg.
    

        Some Tesla investors are worried the billionaire CEO may be spending too much time in Washington, DC, and not enough focusing on the electric vehicle maker.
    

        Musk has been working closely with President Donald Trump and the DOGE office as it seeks to make cuts to eliminate waste and fraud in the federal government, including by cutting spending and the federal workforce.
    

        Trump has said the Tesla and SpaceX CEO is leading the office, but the White House and the Justice Department have denied it, instead naming another official as the administrator of the DOGE office.
    

        Musk said in an interview with Fox Business that aired Monday that it hadn't been easy to juggle leading his companies, including Tesla and SpaceX, while also working on government efficiency efforts.
    

        When asked how he was doing both, Musk replied, ""With great difficulty,"" followed by a long pause and a sigh.
    

Tesla facilities have also been the targets of several attacks, including gunshots and other acts of vandalism, that the police have said could be motivated by Musk's politics and government work.
    

        When asked about those incidents during the Fox interview, Musk said that he wanted to eliminate waste and fraud in government and that he believed he was ""doing the right thing.""

1,2025-03-10,"Google has been tangled in an antitrust mess since a judge ruled last year that it unfairly dominated the online search market.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

The US Department of Justice is once again pressuring Google to divest Chrome, with the goal of challenging its dominant position in search and promoting fair competition.
In a revised filing to Judge Amit Mehta, the DOJ is doubling down on its push for Google to sell off its web browser, and maybe even Android. The agency argues that breaking up these key assets is the only way to fix Google’s monopoly problem.
A group of 38 state attorneys general and the DOJ have teamed up to file the updated proposal laying out the final steps to break Google’s illegal stranglehold on the search engine market. It stays close to the original one submitted to Judge Amit Mehta last November, following his historic ruling that Google is a monopoly in online search.
In its latest filing, the DOJ argues that forcing Google to sell Chrome would break its grip on a key search gateway, opening the door for real competition. It also kept an earlier proposal to stop Google from cutting deals with companies like Apple, phone manufacturers, and Mozilla to lock in its search engine as the default.
A key change in the DOJ’s updated proposal is ditching the demand for Google to sell off its AI investments. Instead of an outright ban, the agency is moving toward a more watchful approach, requiring Google to give regulators a heads-up before making any moves in the AI space.
The DOJ is also holding off on forcing Google to sell Android for now. Instead, the court will keep the option on the table, ready to step in if the current fixes don’t level the playing field. If competition doesn’t improve, Google might have to let go of the operating system down the line.
Google is expected to counter the proposals with its own. In its December filing, the company slammed the DOJ’s initial demands as over the top, calling them an ""interventionist agenda"" that went way beyond the court’s ruling. Google argued the case was about its deals with partners, not the massive overhaul the DOJ is pushing for.

TikTok's future may be up in the air in the US, but it's ramping up in other parts of the world.

        The company officially launched its e-commerce product, Shop, in Mexico in February after testing it in the country. The platform is still getting off the ground there, but it's attracting local sellers like beauty brands Sarelly, Renova, Pink Up Cosmetics, and Sinless Beauty.
    

        The move across the border is also opening an opportunity for US brands to expand into a fast-growing market — and hedge against a possible TikTok ban.
    

        Beauty brand KimChi Chic Beauty, supplement brand Beast Bites, and security-camera brand Wyze are among the US companies planning to expand into Mexico, per two Shop agencies that work with the firms.
    

        ""It's a logical play for any seller that saw success or could see success on TikTok Shop,"" said William August, CEO of the social-commerce agency Outlandish, which runs a livestream facility in Los Angeles and recently set up operations in Mexico. ""Regardless of what happens in the US, they should be doing it anyway.""
    

        TikTok Shop has grown quickly in the US since it first began testing the feature there in 2022. But the app is operating on shaky ground due to a divestment law that requires its Chinese owner, ByteDance, to sell the app or essentially stop operating in the US. While that hasn't deterred many brands that sell goods on TikTok in the US, some are busy diversifying onto other platforms like live-selling app Whatnot or entertainment platforms like Flip and LTK. Moving into other TikTok Shop markets, like the UK, Singapore, and now Mexico, is another tactic.
    

        In some instances, Outlandish is helping US merchants launch in other countries by registering a local business on their behalf, called a merchant of record.
    

        The company also acts as a one-stop shop for other services, like logistics and compliance.
    

        Outlandish set up a joint venture with marketing and retail media firm MindgruveMacarta to help bring US and global brands onto TikTok Shop. In February, Outlandish sent its US livestream training managers to Mexico to teach local staff about selling live, August said. It plans to open a video production hub in the country with the capacity to produce thousands of shopping videos.
    

        ""So long as you have a good product, when you enter a new market with TikTok Shop, you can grow a brand there,"" August said.
    

        Social-commerce agency Orca is also working with third-party logistics providers in Mexico to help US brands start selling in the country, offering services like inventory management and compliance, said its CEO Max Benator. ""If you're a brand in the US, you can't just turn on in Mexico,"" he said.
    

        Shop's entry into a neighboring country allows US sellers to do more than lower their risk from a US ban. It gives them access to an e-commerce market that's on the rise. In September, EMARKETER forecast that e-commerce spending in Latin America would reach close to $180 billion in 2024.
    

        Mexico, in particular, is expected to drive a lot of that growth. In 2024, EMARKETER forecast Mexico would be the fifth-fastest growing e-commerce market in the world, growing online sales by 15.7%.Major retailers like Amazon, Walmart, and Mercado Libre are investing billions of dollars to improve their operations in Mexico and reach a nascent customer base there, according to the firm.
    

        ""Mexico and Latin America are some of the fastest growing e-commerce markets in the world,"" Benator said.

China's capital, Beijing, is making AI education compulsory for students — including elementary schoolers.

        Starting this fall, schools in the city must provide at least eight hours of AI instruction per academic year, the Beijing Municipal Education Commission said in a statement on Friday. Schools can teach AI as a stand-alone course or integrate it into existing courses like science and information technology.
    

        Under the new plan, elementary schoolers, typically ages six to twelve, would take hands-on courses to kick-start their understanding of AI. Those in middle school would learn how to apply AI in schoolwork and daily life, while high schoolerswould focus on strengthening AI applications and innovation, the agency said.
    

        In China, compulsory education consists of six years of elementary school, three years of middle school, and three years of high school.
    

        The commission said the initiative is meant to create a ""teacher-student-machine"" learning model and integrate AI ethics.
    

        Beijing isn't alone in pushing for AI education in schools. Last year, California passed a law requiring its education board to consider AI literacy in school curricula. Reuters reported in September that Italy would begin testing AI-powered tools in 15 classrooms as part of a broader effort to enhance students' digital skills.
    

        Beijing's decision to make AI education mandatory comes as China powers ahead in the AI race, with its homegrown startups gaining global attention.
    

        Earlier this year, AI startup DeepSeek made headlines after unveiling a low-cost reasoning model that shook up the AI industry and the US stock market. The company said its model rivals top competitors, like ChatGPT's o1, at a fraction of the cost.
    

        Last week, Alibaba's stock surged 8% over two days after the company launched its latest open-sourced AI model, which it said used less data than its rival DeepSeek.
    

Other Chinese AI stocks, including Tencent, have also seen gains amid excitement for newly announced technology, while top US-based AI stocks, like Nvidia, have faced losses.

Elon Musk said Monday running his businesses, like Tesla and SpaceX, while also taking on a major government overhaul effort has not been easy.

        During an interview with Fox Business that aired Monday, Musk was asked by host Larry Kudlow how he's running his other businesses while also working closely with the Trump White House.
    

        ""With great difficulty,"" Musk said, followed by a long pause and a sigh but not much more explanation.
    

        ""I'm just here trying to make government more efficient, eliminate waste and fraud, and so far we're making good progress, actually,"" Musk added.
    

        His comment came as Tesla stock declined 15% on Monday, its largest single-day drop since 2020. The stock is down 55% from a high in December, causing concern among investors.
    

        Musk is working closely with the DOGE office, which has pushed spending cuts and mass firings at various government agencies. President Donald Trump has credited Musk with leading the office, though other White House officials have denied it.
    

        Musk said in the Fox interview his team is now made up of more than 100 people and that he expects it to reach 200. He also said they have taken action at virtually every government agency when asked by Kudlow if they were now working in all departments.
    

        ""We're trying to make the government more efficient across the board, so yeah,"" Musk said.
    

        When asked about the recent attacks on Tesla facilities, including gun shots fired at a dealership in Oregon and other acts of vandalism, Musk said it has been ""tough"" but that he thinks ""we're doing the right thing here.""
    

        Musk has been known for investing long hours at his companies, but some investors are worried he's no longer giving Tesla enough of this focus.
    

        ""We think shareholders have legitimate concerns about Elon Musk being spread too thin,"" Garrett Nelson, a senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, told Business Insider's Matthew Fox, ""and it's become clear he's now spending more time on DOGE than anything else.""

    The Federal Reserve's second policy meeting of the year won't change much for mortgage rates in the near term.
  
The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady at its monetary policy meeting this week — though sticky inflation, increased unemployment and slowing economic growth could force the central bank to cut rates in late spring or early summer. 
As recession fears mount and uncertain trade policies pressure financial markets, the key question for investors was how the Trump administration's economic austerity measures and tariffs would influence the Fed's interest rate forecast. 
""Policy is not on a preset course,"" Fed chair Jerome Powell said during Wednesday's press conference. ""We do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance, and we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.""
The Fed is tasked with maintaining maximum employment and containing inflation. A sluggish economy typically warrants interest rate cuts to stimulate growth, but lowering rates too quickly could fuel price growth when inflation is still above target. 
Still, the Federal Reserve, which sets a short-term benchmark interest rate for lenders, only indirectly impacts the mortgage market. In 2024, the central bank cut interest rates three times, but mortgage rates didn't fall.
That's because rates are primarily driven by movement in the bond market, specifically on the 10-year Treasury yield. Bond yields and interest rates rise or fall depending on how new economic data shifts market speculation and risk assessment. Until the impact of the administration's policies is clearer, mortgage rates will continue to fluctuate. 
Read more: How the Federal Reserve's Decision Impacts Mortgage Rates
Fannie Mae projects mortgage rates to stay above 6.5% for the better part of the year. Yet lenders base their rates on a range of factors, and no forecast is set in stone. Given the precarious nature of the economy, any sign of risk or disruption could lower bond yields and impact the trajectory of mortgage rates. 
If an economic downturn appears likely, for example, mortgage rates could start decreasing, but they would need to drop closer to 5.5% to bring buyers into the market at scale, according to Alex Thomas, senior research analyst at John Burns Research and Consulting. 
While cheaper home loan rates are positive for housing affordability, a shaky economy could keep the housing market frozen. ""If lower mortgage rates are the result of a recession, housing demand could remain muted,"" said Thomas.
Prospective homebuyers who have been waiting for mortgage rates to drop for the past few years may need to adjust to the ""new normal"" in the mortgage market, with rates fluctuating between 5% and 7% over the longer term. That may seem high compared to the recent 2% rates of the pandemic era. But experts say getting below 3% on a mortgage is unlikely without a severe economic downturn. Since the 1970s, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has been around 7%. 
Today's unaffordable housing market isn't just a result of high mortgage rates. A long-standing housing shortage, expensive home prices and a loss of purchasing power due to inflation have locked out buyers over the last several years.
With the spring homebuying season fast approaching, prospective homebuyers are left wondering whether to enter the market or continue waiting on the sidelines. It's never a good idea to rush into buying a home without establishing a clear budget. 
Here's what experts recommend before purchasing a home: 
💰 Build your credit score. Your credit score will help determine whether you qualify for a mortgage and at what interest rate. A credit score of 740 or higher will help you qualify for a lower rate.
💰 Save for a bigger down payment. A larger down payment allows you to take out a smaller mortgage and get a lower interest rate from your lender. If you can afford it, a down payment of at least 20% will also eliminate private mortgage insurance.
💰 Shop for mortgage lenders. Comparing loan offers from multiple mortgage lenders can help you negotiate a better rate. Experts recommend getting at least two to three loan estimates from different lenders.
💰 Consider mortgage points. You can get a lower mortgage rate by buying mortgage points, with each point costing 1% of the total loan amount. One mortgage point equals a 0.25% decrease in your mortgage rate."

AvatarOS is betting that AI can supercharge the market for virtual influencers.

        Founded by Isaac Bratzel, the startup is building digital avatars for social media, gaming, apps, and other immersive experiences.
    

        AvatarOS announced this week a $7 million seed investment led by venture capital firm M13. Andreessen Horowitz Games Fund, HF0, Valia Ventures, and Mento VC also participated in the round. AvatarOS has raised $8 million in total since its founding in 2022.
    

        This isn't Bratzel's first rodeo working with digital avatars.
    

        Remember Lil Miquela?
    

        If you don't, she was a pioneering virtual influencer and has over 2 million Instagram followers. Bratzel led the creation of her avatar while at the virtual influencer startup Brud, which was later acquired by NFT startup Dapper Labs in 2021. The Miquela character has been leveraged by brands like Chanel and Prada in marketing campaigns and even has a music career.
    

        Bratzel said Miquela had one major limitation, however. Animation is expensive, and some projects with potential brands or partners simply ""weren't doable,"" he said.
    

        One example, which Bratzel outlines in AvatarOS's investor pitch deck, was Miquela being featured in HBO's hit show ""Euphoria.""
    

        ""It just wasn't feasible because of the technical limitations,"" Bratzel said. It would have cost about $3,000 per second to animate Miquela, per the pitch deck. With advancements in AI, technical limitations for animation are lower than ever, Bratzel said.
    

        One character already developed by this technology is a version of Bratzel himself (who also makes an appearance in the pitch deck).
    

        M13's Latif Peracha, who led the deal, told BI that while running due diligence on AvatarOS prior to investing, he spoke with this virtual version of Bratzel for an hour, discussing hobbies like running and basketball.
    

        While virtual influencers are one application for AvatarOS, Bratzel said the company is broadly thinking about how any ""character-driven content"" could be used across several platforms, pointing to video games as an example.
    

        ""You have this character, you have all these assets, but the social media and the marketing for how you do that is very disjointed,"" he said.
    

        Bratzel said video game companies could use AvatarOS to create avatars of game characters with their own social media accounts and become virtual influencers for the game brand.
    

        The company is also eyeing partnerships with celebrities and sports figures.
    

        ""It feels like the right time where you can scale this type of application,"" Peracha said.
    

Read the 11-page pitch deck AvatarOS used while raising its $7 million seed investment round.

11,2025-03-10,"President Donald Trump triggered Monday’s stock market sell-off with his shifting tariff policies, which are bad news if they’re tactical and even worse if they’re long-term strategies, market observers said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 890 points, or 2.1%, with the other major market indexes showing even steeper losses. The S&P 500 fell 2.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite plummeted 4%. Last week was the stock market’s worst in two years. Yields on Treasuries fell as bond investors bet on interest-rate cuts.
The president’s sweeping tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China last week — with the promise of additional duties in the near future — rattled markets and drove pushback from business groups. Although some exemptions and delays were announced later in the week, Wall Street’s worries weren’t assuaged — especially after Trump refused to rule out a recession in an interview that aired Sunday.
“This is the first time we’ve seen economic-slowdown fears rattle the market in a bunch of years,’’ said Christopher Grisanti, Mai Capital Management’s chief market strategist. “I’ll certainly pin it on the tariffs.”
If the tariffs are purely tactical and short-term — which Grisanti increasingly doubts — then they’ll cause enough uncertainty to prompt companies to delay hiring and put off building factories, weighing on economic growth.
“Investors believe a tariff war is inevitable and this will result in economic inefficiencies,” said Ernan Haruvy, an economist and marketing professor at McGill University. “Moreover, the unpredictability of the tariff policy is making markets jittery and they price in the corresponding risk premium.”
The next possible catalyst for the market will be inflation numbers due Wednesday, said BeiChen Lin, a strategist at Russell Investments. 
“If inflation were to come in somewhat softer than expected, it could potentially help investors breathe a sigh of relief and stabilize equity markets in the near-term,” Lin wrote in a note. “But if inflation were to come in hotter than anticipated, that could spook markets.”
Looking abroad may be a short-term remedy. “Investors are rotating from previous market leaders to companies and markets that have lagged,” said Michael Rosen, the CIO of Angeles Investments. Investors, he said, “should diversify portfolios out of the U.S. as a weaker dollar favors non-U.S. assets.”
If Trump continues to hold with the part of his administration that really wants to bring factories back to the U.S. from overseas, it’s a “whole other ball of wax, and not what the market is expecting,” Mai’s Grisanti said. 
That would mean the two pillars of the post-World War II world order — free trade and NATO — would both be crumbling. 
And that kind of change would “mean much higher costs and take years,” Grisanti said. “I don’t think he’d have public support for that kind of economic pain.” Given how complicated goods have become, the task might not even be a possible, as it’d be “like unscrambling eggs.”
“He is taking on big structural issues,” Grisanti said, “but the question is whether the cure is worse than the disease.”

Multiple outages suffered Monday by the social media platform X were the result of a “massive cyberattack,” claimed Elon Musk, the company's owner.
“We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources. Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved,” Musk claimed in a post on X.
Appearing on Fox Business' ""Kudlow"" later in the afternoon on Monday, Musk elaborated on the claim, suggesting that the attack may have been linked to Ukraine.
""Well, we don't we're not sure exactly what happened, but there was a massive cyber attack to try to bring down the X system with IP addresses originating in the Ukraine area,"" Musk said.
More than 40,000 reports of an outage at X were received on Monday morning by DownDetector, a site that tracks online problem reports from users.
ABC News has reached out to X for comment.
X has undergone some major outages since Musk acquired the company in 2022. In the aftermath of the acquisition, Musk fired top executives and laid off half of the company's staff.
The platform, then known as Twitter, suffered a user outage in February 2023 that lasted for hours and required an emergency fix, prompting an apology from the company.
Musk, who has nearly 220 million followers on the platform, has taken a prominent role in the Trump administration as a leading figure behind the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. As of last month, the cost-cutting group had gained access to at least 15 government agencies.
In addition to the outages at X, Musk faced challenges at another company that he leads: Tesla. Alongside a widespread stock market selloff, shares of Tesla plummeted more than 15% in value as of the market's closing on Monday, bring its drop to more than 41% since the start of 2025.

Broadcom's aggressive cost-cutting strategy has at least halved VMware's workforce while pleasing Wall Street analysts.

        The chip giant closed one of the biggest tech deals ever when it acquired cloud software provider VMware in late 2023. Since closing the acquisition, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan has focused on making the subsidiary more profitable.
    

        Broadcom has been cutting jobs in the past year, including cuts to VMware's salesforce in October and to its professional services team last week, according to current and former employees and LinkedIn posts. In addition, Broadcom has reduced the workforce in other business units or offices over the past few months.
    

        VMware stated that it had more than 38,000 employees as of February 2023, according to a regulatory filing, though many employees and executives departed before the deal closed. Attrition has also contributed to the shrinking workforce. 
    

        By this January, VMware had around 16,000 employees, according to two sources. Employees in marketing, partnerships, and VMware Cloud Foundation have been let go over the past few months, according to former staff and LinkedIn posts.
    

Broadcom has implemented other workplace changes at VMware, such as requiring employees to return to the office. In cases where not enough employees badged into certain offices, Broadcom has shut down those locations and cut staff there, one former employee said. Broadcom did not respond to a request for comment last week.
    

        Tan has concentrated on VMware's largest customers and switched to a subscription-based business model from a perpetual license approach. He said on Thursday's earnings call that 60% of customers had so far been converted.
    

        The company also raised prices. VMware customers have said they've faced massive hikes due to product bundling, which means multiple products are packaged together and customers have to pay for them all.
    

        Broadcom's stock has climbed about 40% in the past year. In December, Broadcom's market cap hit $1 trillion.
    

        Analysts have largely been pleased by Broadcom's handling of the merger integration.
    

        ""The VMware kicker continues to execute, which shouldn't be a surprise, given Hock Tan's expertise on his wash, rinse, and repeat M&A playbook,"" said Dave Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, ahead of Thursday's blockbuster earnings release.


        William Blair analysts called VMware the ""star in software,"" saying it was an ""opportunity for Broadcom to drive sustained software growth and potentially reduce the impact of heightened customer churn going into 2027.""
    

Following the acquisition, Broadcom made steep job cuts and consolidated teams at VMware, as BI previously reported. Broadcom had cut at least 2,000 employees around that time.
    

        Broadcom also divested some business units, such as End-User Computing.

16,2025-03-10,"A former senior Facebook executive has told the BBC how the social media giant worked ""hand in glove"" with the Chinese government on potential ways of allowing Beijing to censor and control content in China.
Sarah Wynn-Williams - a former global public policy director - says in return for gaining access to the Chinese market of hundreds of millions of users, Facebook's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, considered agreeing to hiding posts that were going viral, until they could be checked by the Chinese authorities.
Ms Williams - who makes the claims in a new book - has also filed a whistleblower complaint with the US markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), alleging Meta misled investors. The BBC has reviewed the complaint.
Facebook's parent company Meta, says Ms Wynn-Williams had her employment terminated in 2017 ""for poor performance"".
It is ""no secret we were once interested"" in operating services in China, it adds. ""We ultimately opted not to go through with the ideas we'd explored.""
Meta referred us to Mark Zuckerberg's comments from 2019, when he said: ""We could never come to agreement on what it would take for us to operate there, and they [China] never let us in.""
Facebook also used algorithms to spot when young teenagers were feeling vulnerable as part of research aimed at advertisers, Ms Wynn-Williams alleges.
A former New Zealand diplomat, she joined Facebook in 2011, and says she watched the company grow from ""a front row seat"".
Now she wants to show some of the ""decision-making and moral compromises"" that she says went on when she was there. It is a critical moment, she adds, as ""many of the people I worked with… are going to be central"" to the introduction of AI.
In her memoir, Careless People, Ms Wynn-Williams paints a picture of what she alleges working on Facebook's senior team was like.
Mr Zuckerberg, she says, did not get up before midday, loved karaoke and did not like to be beaten at board games, such as Risk. ""I didn't realise that you were supposed to let him win. I was a little naive,"" she told us.
However, Ms Wynn-Williams says her allegations about the company's close relationship with China provide an insight into Facebook's decision-making at the time.
""China is Mark Zuckerberg's white whale,"" meaning a goal that he obsessively pursued, says Ms Wynn-Williams.
The country is the world's biggest social media market, but access to Facebook remains blocked there, alongside the likes of X and YouTube.
""It's the one piece on the board game that he hasn't conquered,"" she says.
Ms Wynn-Williams claims that in the mid-2010s, as part of its negotiations with the Chinese government, Facebook considered allowing it future access to Chinese citizens' user data.
""He was working hand in glove with the Chinese Communist Party, building a censorship tool… basically working to develop sort of the antithesis of many of the principles that underpin Facebook,"" she told the BBC.
Ms Wynn-Williams says governments frequently asked for explanations of how aspects of Facebook's software worked, but were told it was proprietary information.
""But when it came to the Chinese, the curtain was pulled back,"" she says.
""Engineers were brought out. They were walked through every aspect, and Facebook was making sure these Chinese officials were upskilled enough that they could not only learn about these products, but then test Facebook on the censorship version of these products that they were building.""
Meta told the BBC that such claims about China had been ""widely reported"" at the time.
In her SEC complaint, Ms Wynn-Williams also alleges Mr Zuckerberg and other Meta executives had made ""misleading statements… in response to Congressional inquiries"" about China.
One answer given by Mr Zuckerberg to Congress in 2018 said Facebook was ""not in a position to know exactly how the [Chinese] government would seek to apply its laws and regulations on content""
Meta told the BBC that Mr Zuckerberg gave accurate testimony, adding it did not operate services in China.
Most Facebook executives didn't allow their own children on Facebook - according to Ms Wynn-Williams. ""They had screen bans. They certainly wouldn't allow them to use the product.""
And yet she says reports from 2017 - that the company had been using algorithms to target and categorise vulnerable teens - were true.
""The algorithm could infer that they were feeling worthless or unhappy,"" she alleges.
The company - which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp - could, she claims, identify when a teenage girl had deleted a selfie on its platforms, and then notify a beauty company that it would be a good moment to target the child with an advert.
Ms Wynn-Williams says she ""felt sick"" at the thought and tried to push back, ""although I knew it was futile"".
""They said: 'The business side thinks this is exactly what we should be doing. We've got this amazing product, we can get young people, which is a really important advertising segment.'""
Meta told the BBC this was false - it has never offered tools to target people based on their emotional state - and that the research it previously did was to help marketers understand how people express themselves on Facebook, not to target ads.
Overall, Ms Wynn-Williams says the company has not done enough to address the issue of young people's safety on social media.
""This is one of the most valuable companies in the world. They could invest in this and make it a real priority and do more to fix it.""
Facebook said it was transparent about advert-targeting and had shared updates regarding its approach to creating age-appropriate advert experiences for teens.
It also said it had introduced ""Teen Accounts"" for tens of millions of young people with built-in protections. It also said it was giving parents more oversight over their teens' use of the app.
As well as poor performance, Meta says the 45-year-old was also fired for ""toxic behaviour"" after she had made ""misleading and unfounded allegations of harassment"".
But Ms Wynn-Williams told the BBC she was let go after she had complained about inappropriate comments by one of her bosses - Joel Kaplan, who is now Meta's chief global affairs officer.
Meta told us she had been paid by ""anti-Facebook activists"" and she was not a whistleblower.
""Whistleblower status protects communications to the government, not disgruntled activists trying to sell books,"" it said.
In regard to Ms Wynn-Williams' book, Meta has confirmed to the BBC that it has launched legal action in the US to ""halt the further distribution of defamatory and untrue information"".
To counter this, a legal representative for Ms Wynn-Williams said: ""Meta has made a number of false and inconsistent statements about Sarah since the news of her memoir broke... while Meta's statements are trying to mislead the public, the book speaks for itself"".
We asked her why she was speaking out now. She said she wanted Meta to change as it ""influences so much of our day-to-day life"" and we need to ensure ""we get the future we deserve"".
""We're in this moment where tech and political leaders are coming together and as they combine forces, that has a lot of consequences for all of us.
""I think it's really important to understand that and to understand you look at all these engineers who are influencing the highest level of government.""

17,2025-03-10,"Rep. Ro Khanna is introducing the Drain The Swamp Act.
As Democrats attempt to rebound from an underwhelming showing in the 2024 election, California Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna is not only taking stock of the stinging defeat last fall, but also taking shots at his own political party.
After watching Democrats swap nominees and struggle to deliver a cohesive message to voters in the last campaign cycle, Khanna told ABC News in an exclusive interview that he believes a political reform agenda focused on combating corruption ""is what we should run on in 2026"" and laments the political costs that came as Democrats campaigned on other priorities in 2024.
""It was a mistake,"" Khanna said, adding he ""didn't hear any political reform agenda"" from President Joe Biden or Vice President Kamala Harris during their respective presidential campaigns. ""Trump became the outsider. It was a mistake we didn't run on the theme of reform. Getting money and lobbyists out of politics -- that should be our mantle.""
Now, Khanna is introducing the Drain The Swamp Act, which would permanently prohibit White House officials from accepting gifts from lobbyists -- reinstating a Biden-era mandate that established ethics and lobbying rules for appointees in the administration.
""Anti-corruption has to be core to rebuilding the Democratic brand,"" Khanna, serving in his fifth term, said. ""Democrats need to be seen as owning the mantle of reform.""
Khanna said he finds it striking that one of President Donald Trump's first acts of his second term was to sign an executive order to overturn Biden's order -- creating the impetus to craft an agenda that takes aim at Washington's revolving door between lobbyists and lawmakers.
""It's part of a broader sense that Democrats have to run on anti-corruption,"" Khanna said, complaining that the Democratic Party enabled Trump to ""co-opt"" the ""drain the swamp"" theme of anti-corruption. Khanna said it has cost his party not only two presidential elections in 2016 and 2024, but also majority control of Congress.
""We need to be zealous,"" Khanna said -- explaining his vision for a five-point anti-corruption agenda.
Khanna wants to ban former members of Congress from ever lobbying Congress, and he wants to impose 12-year term limits for members and 18-year term limits on Supreme Court justices. Khanna says he believes timed-out justices should return to serve on lower courts after they leave a post on the high court. Khanna also advocates for a ""binding code of ethics"" for Supreme Court justices amid ethics pressure on the court.
""If Democrats want to rebuild, start with anti-political corruption,"" Khanna stressed, adding he has received a positive reception from a range of people such as billionaire Mark Cuban and even Republican voters who are supportive of his pledge to ""drain the swamp.""
Khanna also calls for a ban on members of Congress and their families from holding and trading individual stocks during the member's tenure in office, as well as a ban on members of Congress and candidates running for House or Senate seats from accepting contributions from political action committees.
As for his own future political interest -- whether reelection, the California governor's mansion or even the White House in 2028 -- Khanna is keeping his cards close, but his options open.
""Ro believes that anti-corruption and economic patriotism need to be the driving themes of the Democratic Party for 2026 and 2028, regardless of who gets into the fray or leads the party,"" Sarah Drory, a Khanna spokeswoman, told ABC when asked about the congressman's political prospects.
Nevertheless, Khanna's profile continues to grow as he faces voters and weighs his future options -- sometimes even before Republican audiences on Fox News or in GOP-held districts.
After Trump delivered a joint address to Congress last week, Khanna went on ""Fox News Sunday"" and admitted that it ""was not a good look"" as Democrats protested not only the president, but also rejected the invited guests in the First Lady's box.
""We should have stood for the boy with cancer. You stand for the president of the United States, out of respect for the American people,"" Khanna said on the program. ""I mean, you stand for the widow of the firefighter.""
""The story should have been on President Trump,"" Khanna continued. ""We should have been talking about the Medicaid cuts. Instead, we're talking about our own behavior. And that's a distraction from us getting out our economic message.""
Khanna will also hold three in-person town hall meetings during a ""Benefits Over Billionaires"" tour on March 23 in GOP-held districts, where his anti-corruption agenda will take stage alongside his progressive bona fides.
""It's smart to have a clear message,"" Khanna told ABC News. ""We're the party that's going to save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.""

18,2025-03-10,"The stock market selloff stretched into a new week, with the latest losses heagain tied to comments from President Donald Trump, whose wide-sweeping and oft-changing tariff policies have rattled Wall Street confidence, as early fears of a recession emerge.
Traders work the floor of the New York Stock Exchange last week.
All three major U.S. stock indexes fell significantly Monday, erasing Friday afternoon’s comeback.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.1%, or 890 points, while the S&P 500 declined 2.7% and the Nasdaq Composite sank 4%.
The benchmark S&P and the Nasdaq closed at their lowest respective levels since mid September, while the Dow ended at its lowest price since September.
Monday was be the Nasdaq’s worst daily decline since September 2022.
Driving Monday’s pullback was Trump’s interview with Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures” released Sunday, during which Trump declined to rule out a recession, warned of a period of economic “transition” and cautioned “you can’t really watch the stock market.”
Trump’s comments are “weighing on sentiment” and “did nothing to ease investor concerns about ongoing policy chaos,” Sevens Report founder Tom Essaye wrote in a Monday note to clients.
Trump may say to heed little attention to near-term stock moves, but the losses are staggering. The Nasdaq is in correction territory, declining 13% from its closing price on Feb. 19, when the market took a sharply negative turn. The S&P is down 9% during that period, while the Dow is down 6%, or 2,700 points. The S&P is fresh off of its worst week since September, declining 3.1% last week.
Big Tech stocks are the most notable individual losers during the brutal three-week stretch, namely artificial intelligence chip architect Nvidia and electric vehicle maker Tesla, led by Trump administration official Elon Musk. Shares of Nvidia dipped 5% on Monday, extended its loss dating back to Feb. 19 to 23%, and shares of Tesla fell 14%, pushing its loss dating back to Feb. 19 to 37%. Also sinking Monday were shares of Apple, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta, as each Silicon Valley giant sank about 5% as investors fled to safety.
20%. That’s about how much the “magnificent seven” group of big American tech companies — Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla — is collectively down from its December record, according to Bloomberg.
The recent decline coincided with Trump’s implementation of tariffs, which are largely a bad thing for stocks as they can hurt corporate profit margins and soften consumer demand. But even beyond any negative direct effects of tariffs, markets have responded negatively to Trump’s frequent waffling on when the duties will go into effect, as well as what goods. “The reason stocks are dropping is the spike in uncertainty and fear that uncertainty will lead to a whole host of negatives,” explained Essaye. To that end, the new fear of the U.S. entering a recession has become a topic of conversation. Goldman Sachs economists increased their recession forecast Friday, calling for 20% odds of a significant downturn over the next 12 months, up from 15%, citing trade policies.
Morgan Stanley strategists led by Michael Wilson maintained their 6,500 price target for the S&P by the end of 2025, calling for a 16% gain from Monday’s roughly 5,610. Trump’s policies will be “sequenced in a more growth-negative way to start the year before” lower interest rates and friendlier corporate policies “benefit the market later in the year,” said Wilson.
“This is a headline driven market, one that could change in an hour. Sit tight. Buckle up,” Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group, wrote in emailed comments.

19,2025-03-10,"Stocks fell sharply on Monday as Wall Street’s fears tied to President Donald Trump’s tariffs continue to pressure the market and investors wait for new economic data, especially inflation on Wednesday.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 890 points, or 2.1%. But the other major market indexes saw even steeper losses: The S&P 500 fell 2.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite plummeted 4%. Last week was the stock market’s worst in two years. The yields on Treasury bonds dropped today as investors bet that a slowing economy will prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.
“Uncertainty about U.S. trade policy and weaker economic data are leading to investor caution,” Angeles Investments CIO Michael Rosen told Quartz. Investors, he said, “are rotating from previous market leaders to companies and markets that have lagged. Investors should diversify portfolios out of the U.S. as a weaker dollar favors non-U.S. assets.”
The so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks also lost ground. Tesla (TSLA+5.27%) stock dropped 15%, erasing its post-election rally. Nvidia (NVDA+2.83%) stock was off 5.1%, bringing its slide so far this year to about 23% amid tariff and recession fears.
The president’s sweeping tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China last week — with the promise of additional duties in the near future — rattled stock markets and drove pushback from business groups. Although some exemptions and delays were announced later in the week, Wall Street’s worries weren’t assuaged.
Goldman Sachs (GS+1.35%) said Friday that the likelihood of a recession within the next 12 months has increased from 15% to 20%. If the White House continues with additional tariffs, the bank said the risk of a recession would increase.
On Sunday, Trump was asked by Fox News (FOXA+0.88%) host Maria Bartiromo if he was expecting a recession this year. The president didn’t rule it out as a potential outcome.
“I hate to predict things like that,” Trump said. “There is a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big. We’re bringing wealth back to America. That’s a big thing, and there are always periods of, it takes a little time. It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us.”
Cabinet officials have largely brushed off the market’s decline, even as they acknowledge some signs of weakness in the economy. 
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC that the market has “just become hooked” on government spending and that “there’s going to be a detox period.” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the U.S. would stick to its future tariff plans, said he wouldn’t bet on a recession, and said the stock market doesn’t affect federal policy.

Today, in the Calculated Risk Real Estate Newsletter: Part 1: Current State of the Housing Market; Overview for mid-March 2025
A brief excerpt: This 2-part overview for mid-March provides a snapshot of the current housing market.

Inventory, inventory, inventory!  Inventory usually tells the tale.  Currently I’m watching months-of-supply closely.
...  
Since both inventory and sales have fallen significantly, a key for house prices is to watch months-of-supply. The following graph shows months-of-supply since 2017. The following graph shows months-of-supply since 2017. Note that months-of-supply is higher than 6 of the last 8 years, and at the same level as in 2017.

Months-of-supply was at 3.5 months in January 2025, up from 3.0 months in January 2024, and down from 3.8 months in January 2019. Note that December and January usually have the lowest months-of-supply.

This suggests that year-over-year price growth will continue to slow. Inventory would probably have to increase to 5 1/2 to 6 months of supply to see national price declines again.There is much more in the article.

22,2025-03-10,"After Donald Trump was named the president-elect of the United States, Tesla (TSLA+5.27%) stock roared, reaching new highs. But backlash over CEO Elon Musk’s relationship with the president has erased all of those gains. 
As of publication, Tesla stock goes for $242.25 per share, after falling by more than 8% in midday trading on Monday. Since January 1, the stock has fallen by more than 36%. 
That brings the stock back to where it was on November 4, 2024, the day before the presidential election. At the time, the stock was valued at $242.84 per share. 
The stock’s decline has been accelerated by poor sales in January and February, from Australia to Norway, partly due to Tesla factories preparing for a refreshed Model Y SUV and partly due to outrage over Musk’s politics. In February, Tesla’s Chinese shipments plunged 49%.
“As a successful businessman, one should be embracing 100% of the market: treat everyone nicely, and everyone will be nice in return,” Cui Dongshu, Secretary General of the Chinese Passenger Car Association, said Monday. ““But if you look at it in terms of voting, then half of voters will be friendly to you and half of them won’t be.”
Musk has spent much of his time since the election working alongside President Donald Trump in Washington, serving as the leader of the Department of Government Efficiency, which has been embroiled in legal battles. He’s also endorsed Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany party and participated in an online campaign to convince British officials to release far-right agitator Tommy Robinson.
In solidly-blue California, traditionally Tesla’s biggest domestic market, new vehicle registrations fell 11.6% last year, according to the California New Car Dealers Association.” Musk’s political activities have cost Tesla about $15 billion in brand value, Brand Finance told CNBC in January.
Protests have been organized at Tesla showrooms and facilities across the nation since Trump was inaugurated in January. More than a dozen violent or destructive acts have been directed at the company’s facilities in that time, according to The Washington Post, including one instance where an individual planted a Molotov cocktail near a vehicle. 
In France, a dozen Teslas were set on fire near the city of Toulouse, France24 reported. And in Berlin, fires broke out at a construction site for the expansion of a Tesla factory.

The Wall Street Journal publisher’s thoughts on what it takes for journalism to thrive in 2025.

Today, I’m talking with Almar Latour, who is the publisher of The Wall Street Journal and CEO of its parent company Dow Jones, which you can think of as a huge research and data provider for companies of all sizes. Dow Jones itself is part of Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. 
Latour is a fascinating guy. He started as a news assistant at the Journal in the ’90s, spent time as a tech reporter, and eventually rose through the ranks to become CEO in 2020, putting him in charge of how everything makes money.
And if you’ve been paying attention, you know it’s a tough time to be making money in the news business, especially the paid news business. In addition to competing with the flood of free content on various social and streaming platforms, the industry is also facing new challenges like fights about copyright and AI and battles with the Trump administration, which has been pushing hard to shut down critical reporting and limit press freedom.
Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here!
Latour has insight into all of that: On the news side, he’s made a big content-use deal with OpenAI while also suing Perplexity for training without permission. On the other side, he’s pushing to build his own AI data products for Dow Jones customers. 
He is a fierce defender of press freedom who fought to have Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich released from Russia after being imprisoned for more than a year. But at the same time, he works at News Corp, whose chairman, Rupert Murdoch, has deep ties to President Donald Trump and who has overseen a vastly polarized and politicized era of news media.
So I asked Latour about all of that and really pushed him on a few of his answers — even right at the top of the conversation, when I asked him about the Journal cutting a huge chunk of its tech reporting team literally the day before we recorded. To his credit, Latour was game and he hung in there, but you’ll hear him congratulate me for almost getting him to slip up. I did my best; I think many of you will have thoughts about it.
Okay: Almar Latour, CEO of Dow Jones and publisher of The Wall Street Journal. Here we go.
This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. 
Almar Latour, you are CEO of Dow Jones and the publisher of The Wall Street Journal. Welcome to Decoder.
Great to be here. Thank you.
I have a lot to talk about with you. There’s an entire set of complicated AI questions that might be existential for the media industry, but you’re heavily invested in building some of that technology and some of those services, which I think is interesting. There’s the general state of the press in 2025, which I want to talk to you about. I know you’re very interested in press freedom. 
But it happens that I have you on the day after the news, so I want to start with the news. Just last night, The Wall Street Journal, of which Dow Jones is the publisher, restructured how it covers tech and media. That involved cutting about 10 or 15 editors and reporters. Obviously, I’m very interested in how you structure a newsroom to cover tech. Why make that decision? Why get smaller?
First, this is a newsroom decision, so this is squarely in the terrain of [editor-in-chief] Emma Tucker, who’s a new editor, relatively speaking. She’s in year two, moving into year three. Emma was hired with a remit of helping to increase engagement with our existing readers, to expand our readership, and to maintain and enhance the quality of our coverage. She has set out over the past two years to rethink how she wants to offer news with The Wall Street Journal newsroom. 
Her consistent message, and this is one that I subscribe to, is that distinctive journalism is what makes the difference. It’s about knowing the interesting story, the story behind the story, and to have exclusive journalism and insights. That I say as a preface because Emma has been making changes to nearly every part of The Wall Street Journal and continues to do that.
So what happened yesterday was a continuation of that. Generally, when you look at the changes that she’s brought in — I’m not speaking specifically about the San Francisco bureau but tech — it’s been new talent. She has an antenna for what she thinks works there. And one of the areas where that’s been very pronounced in recent months is in Washington, D.C. That has gone through several cycles of changes.
She’s brought in new people, and that has had consequences. The marching orders are slightly different when there is a closer connection to the center of the newsroom, where the decisions about news can be made in the context of a broader story that’s happening around the world, rather than in isolation around a certain topic. So that’s the context for yesterday. 
I’m not going to comment on specific individuals or Emma’s specific plans. I’ll leave that to her. I’ve worked with quite a few of those people. As you know, I was a tech reporter myself. But overall, what Emma has focused on, and what the Journal and Dow Jones are focusing on, is going deeper and having more exclusivity, more “proprietary content.” Moments like yesterday are absolutely never easy.
I think I see a thesis of Dow Jones as a company, and we’ll get to the big picture in a second here. The idea is you’re going to give a bunch of people in the business world an information edge, whether it’s with the Dow Jones Information Services, some of the AI tools, or with The Wall Street Journal, which gets a bunch of scoops and tells people stuff they didn’t know before. 
I’m just looking at this broadly. I’m looking at Dow Jones as part of News Corp. I’m looking at News Corp’s financials from last month. Revenue at Dow Jones is up to $600 million. That’s up 3 percent. Your earnings are up 7 percent to $174 million. But the cuts are in tech, which is dominating the world. I’m just wondering about that resource allocation because that’s the role of the publisher.
Well, it is in the sense that the newsroom has a budget, and we support quality journalism. Frankly, we are so successful at this moment as a company that all of our investments are in enhancing the quality of our journalism, data, analytics, etc. Getting better news, getting better information is the mission, and we are investing in that.
So, I just want to correct one simplification that sometimes comes to the surface at moments like this. I don’t think you intended to do that, but I think it’s important to make a distinction. It’s super hard when you go through what happened yesterday and many other times in journalism. But this shift, like any other shift that Emma has gone through, is not to eke out more profit by having fewer resources. There is an overall climate inside our company. You see our earnings, revenue, and subscription base growing.
We will invest wherever there’s a good business case to be made. Tech and the cross section of tech with policy, politics, global trade, and society is one of the top priorities for Dow Jones, and one of the top stories in the world. So, don’t take a snapshot and say, “Okay, we’re going to stop there.” This is a top priority. Tech will permeate everything — it is permeating everything right now. Look at Washington, D.C. or at the announcements from President Emmanuel Macron in France. So, don’t take the snapshot, that is where I was headed. This is a moment in time. We can talk again in a year, and our tech coverage should be broader, deeper and probably have a larger following.
I run a tech publication — what is nominally a tech publication — and we are heavily invested in covering policy. One of the lines we’ve always used, a cliche even, is that, “The Verge can cover everything because everything is now a tech story.”
That was a way 10 years ago of maintaining a broad focus, and now, it’s very real. Elon Musk is at the State of the Union. You can see the tech giants fighting tooth and nail against the Digital Services Act in the EU, and that is now a part of American foreign policy. Do you see that as, “Okay, maybe all of The Wall Street Journal is about tech in that way?” Is that getting more expansive for you?
There is a current of tech that runs through every story at The Wall Street Journal. It runs through everything at Dow Jones in two ways: as a story and as technology. There’s not a part of The Wall Street Journal or Dow Jones where tech does not feature. Having people cover tech in isolation is one way of covering this. In addition, tech is a core part of many other beats and areas that we cover. Tech is a horizontal and a vertical at the same time.
We’ll come back to the AI deals you’ve struck. I want to talk about them expansively. Just in this context, like so many publishers, you’ve struck a deal with OpenAI and other AI companies. Are those providing enough revenue for you to invest against in the newsroom, or are you still in wait-and-see mode with those deals?
I don’t think we should tether our investments in AI to any individual AI deal. That’s not how I look at it. It’s not like, “Oh, AI brings in this much money, and now I can invest this much in AI.” You could, I guess, rationalize it that way.
Or the newsroom.
AI in the newsroom or in the newsroom [itself]. We have our investment priorities, and we’re following a game plan that we’ve been following for a while. It meanders every once in a while, but the goal is pretty clear. We intend on growing in three ways. One is by going deeper, so investing in the depth of our content, our data, and our analytics by growing wider. 
We do this by adding new areas of expertise. Just last week, we announced our agreement to acquire Oxford Analytica. Going deep into geopolitics is an addition. But in future investments, once it’s a part of Dow Jones and The Wall Street Journal, we will probably invest in going deeper into that area of geopolitics. 
Then, the third wave is by connecting everything that we have. There should be easier access to the data that underlies everything at Dow Jones and everything that we do at The Wall Street Journal.
Now, to your question, investing in the newsroom is a goal in itself. We are a successful, leading, subscription-driven news organization, and we grow by investing in our journalism, not by shrinking our journalism. Sometimes there’s a temptation to be in austerity mode and to just take away in order to eke out a profit. That’s not us, and that’s not how we’re growing whatsoever.
I think it’s more than a temptation for most media businesses right now. That is the reality of the situation, right? It costs more to make the information than most people can return on it.
Yeah, but if your answer to that time and time again is, “Okay, I’ll cut in order to make ends meet,” then you’re not addressing something at the base. You’re not addressing something in your model. You might not be addressing something correctly in the way you’re organized or where you’re focused. That, to me, was never an acceptable method to grow or create great journalism. I understand that sometimes you have your back against the wall as a company in any industry. You may have to cut in order to make ends meet, but that’s not a strategy.
People get that wrong. I think you’re absolutely right. That might be a prevailing tendency, but I don’t think it should be. The prevailing focus should be about making a difference in the news and information that you offer. How do you make that distinctive? How do you add value? How do you allow people to make decisions based on that? How do you convince people that they should recognize the value of the information that you offer? 
People in the past used to say, “You’re a subscription business. You’re The Wall Street Journal. You’re all about business, and therefore, that doesn’t apply to anything else.” I don’t think that is true. I think people recognize the value of a lot of different types of information. It doesn’t just have to be about business. So, I actually think there’s a lot of opportunity in shifting from this austerity mode to creation and building mode. Easier said than done, and sometimes, you have to step away from things that just aren’t working.
I think that recognition of value is very challenging. I understand why it happens in the business community. I even understand why it happens for us in the tech press because it’s often tradable. You can pay a high rate to The Wall Street Journal if you are a Wall Street trader, an investor, or some other kind of business professional because the information has a clear value that you can use to trade upon to make a deal or an investment, to buy or sell a stock.
I think that information is not tradeable for the average consumer. They just open TikTok. Maybe there’s some influencer reading The Wall Street Journal to them for free. That elimination of scarcity, I think, has been the fundamental challenge. It was the challenge when we went to social media, the challenge when we went to these social video platforms. It feels like the challenge again for AI, right? The AI platforms are going to take all of the world’s information and completely eliminate even the scarcity of having to click. They’re just going to tell you what the models have read on the internet. Do you perceive that as existential a challenge as some of your peers in the media do?
I think you’re absolutely right in that the bar on being distinctive with the content, news, or information that you create has gone way up. So, you have to be more discerning where you focus. You ask about the existential threat around AI, and that goes back to the recognition of value. I want to make sure that the industry — certainly Dow Jones, The Wall Street Journal, and all of our publications — don’t fall into a trap that is similar to two decades ago when all information had to be free, people took scraps from search engines,. and then found out over time that they’ve effectively lost, that we seeded that market. So, that’s why we are investing time and resources right now into making sure that large players in the AI space recognize that value.
Our push is to make sure that there is a commercial agreement around that. And I think that is the preferred outcome in many cases on both sides of that fence. Where we can’t reach a commercial agreement, where there are fundamental differences of opinion, we are prepared, in some cases, to say, “Then we’ll fight it out in court.” So, we’ve walked both paths, with a preference for the first. 
I’m still answering your question as to what’s existential here and is there an existential threat. You spun it forward and we can get through that, what it means for the end user and how consumers respond to that. But I think first, we have to get the starting blocks. These are the companies that are providing generative AI, UX, and new interactions for consumers. They have gotten to that point by using information. We need an acknowledgement that the information that has value, certainly our information, and that if you want to use that information on an ongoing basis, that some of your generative AI-produced content answers to queries are current and reliable. You’ll have to pay us for access if you value that. That part we cannot skip over. There’s a whole other part of this where we don’t yet exactly know how the user is going to interact, but we see the trending there. We have to get that part right. We’re in the middle of that, or maybe we’re at the first part of that still.
I’m going to ask you one more very existential philosophical question, and I need to get back to having you explain the company — 
Yeah. All my favorite topics.
There’s that line, that a lie goes around the world six times when the truth is putting on shoes. It feels like we might be describing a world where regular people are awash in a sea of free lies that come to them on social media. The social media companies are all giving up on fact checks. Various billionaires say whatever they want on podcasts with no pushback. And what you are providing is a very expensive source of truth, or hopefully what I am providing is an affordable source of truth. That’s a big discrepancy, right?
I would say we’re as affordable as a cup of coffee a day. Everyone drinks coffee. I think it’s a myth that access to reliable information is unaffordable. It is an individual choice. I realize it’s a hard choice to make if you don’t have significant disposable income, and that’s what you’re indicating, but I do believe that there’s a choice to be made.
I understand why people would buy The Wall Street Journal or some of Dow Jones’ products, which we should come to. But that’s the bigger picture, right? It’s convincing the next consumer that they should pay for information as opposed to picking a filter bubble on social media. Whether that’s AI, social media, or if it’s just algorithms, that seems like the challenge the media faces.
The challenge is to convince someone that it’s to their benefit to invest in having access to reliable information. Whether that’s for making decisions in the realm of investments, technology, policy, or whether it’s hyperlocal and I actually want to understand what’s going on in my community, some of that I might get from AI. But some of that I might not. I might want to invest a small amount of money into understanding what’s happening in my community. There’s some examples of that popping up.
In response to this huge question that you’re asking, I think we’ll see innovation in journalism and a lot of creativity — already and in years to come — where, undeniably, there’s this flood of information of mixed quality.There’s also, undeniably, a huge demand for reliable information. People are craving it more than ever before. In fact, the more noise there is, the more people are confused and the more they are asking, “Hey, tell me what this means.” 
We see this in our data. We see this when there are moments of friction in society, in business, or in geopolitics with any market. We see a spike and people coming to us for free, but we also see a spike in subscriptions. Demand for reliable information, I think, has gone up as the pool of unreliable or uncertain information has grown. Some of it might be reliable, some of it might not be.
I think you cast that as an existential risk. I can cast that as an opportunity. I like to be aware of the existential risk and take the precautions there, but mainly focus on the opportunity and meeting that demand. I don’t think we have met that demand by any stretch. I think there’s a huge opportunity for us and for other publications in lying ahead to meet that demand. I think that demand will actually only grow.
This is a good place to back up a little. We’ve talked a lot about The Wall Street Journal. I think people know about The Wall Street Journal. I think Decoder listeners also probably know about Rupert Murdoch and News Corp, which is the parent company of The Wall Street Journal. Describe how all of that fits together in your role as CEO of Dow Jones.
In its most simplified form, I think of Dow Jones as a Rubik’s Cube, and inside is all of our premium journalism, exclusives, or explanations of what’s happening right now. There’s our proprietary data that we have on many different sectors in the global economy. There’s Factiva with thousands and thousands of sources from around the world sitting inside that Rubik’s Cube. 
Each tile on that Rubik’s Cube is a way to get out of Dow Jones what is important and relevant to you. Maybe I want a couple of different tiles or maybe I want the whole thing, but that’s fundamentally a way of thinking about how we operate and how, ultimately, we’re organized. AI is actually helping a great deal with this and it’s accelerating with generative AI. AI and automation has been with Dow Jones for a long, long time.
Let’s then make that a little bit more complex. If one of those tiles is about bond trading, I ought to be able to get all information: premium information and live information, but also analytics and forecasting to help me in my job. We’ll get to AI in a moment, but the cards I was dealt when I took over almost five years ago as CEO was to look at Dow Jones as a platform of verticals. 
You’ve got business news, which is both a horizontal and a vertical, but that’s The Wall Street Journal, as you say. It needs no huge explanation there. There’s wealth and investing, where we have Barron’s, MarketWatch, Financial News, which is a title in the U.K., and Private Equity News. We’ve got a compliance arm that has data on compliance. It helps companies discern, “Should I do business with this person or not? Are they on a sanctions list or not?” We’ve since added an energy arm and within that, commodities and petrochemicals. We’ve added a leadership arm, organically, looking at what it takes to be a modern leader. 
Each of these verticals, if you will, is successful when it does four things. You have to have leading news in that particular vertical, in that particular area of concentration. So pick your industry. Unless you have that, you’re not relevant. Second, you have to have proprietary data. Some of that can come out of the news, some of it you have to build, some of it you have to buy, and we’ve done that. If you have those two things, you can do proper analytics. AI helps with that to some degree. If you sell products that can do forecasting and analytics, that’s where the value keeps going up. Then, the fourth factor is convening power — that is bringing people in that industry, in that sector, in that vertical together.
If you have those four, you actually get a mini-network effect inside that industry. We’ve seen that happen, and it happened by design. We’ve executed this with our manager, Joel Lange, who runs our risk and compliance business. If you have all those four parts, then you see the leaders in that industry come together. Take risk and compliance. You see compliance officers coming together and our [Chief Compliance Officer Council] at Davos and in other places. So, now you have thought leaders there.
Well, the procurement officers who buy our data products see, “Oh, yeah, the people that are leading my department or leading my company are talking on a Dow Jones platform about these big themes.” So it anchors Dow Jones more deeply, whether that’s just an observation and anecdotal or whether that actually translates into business. Often it translates into business. That has the same effect on our analytical products.
Then if you add news to that risk vertical — we have mentioned internally that we will have a risk journal — you will have risk industry folks, compliance officers and the like, tap into that news product to actually start their workday and understand what’s happening. Now, we are present in your workflow in that industry end to end. By the way, since we’re The Wall Street Journal, we’re probably also still with you in another way when you go home.
So that’s the view of the company and our operating model. Build verticals that have these four parts at a minimum. Go deeper and make that exclusive. This is why what Emma is doing in the The Wall Street Journal newsroom really matters. More exclusives and more distinctive journalism helps with the news obviously. 
We’ve built, bought, and created more proprietary data. We’ve spent well in excess of $1 billion on getting companies that are specialized in that added to our roster. We’re doing more analytics and even a little bit of consulting. We’re never going to be a consulting company, but that’s an outflow of analytics. Then,there’s convening power. I think for a long time, the media sort of misread that as just events, but it’s something far bigger than that. I think it’s a subscription business.It’s a recurring revenue business, it should be. It doesn’t mean that you can’t have sponsorship for it, but it is fundamental to anchoring the decision-makers of a certain industry in your platform.
When we have all four parts, we call it a full stack. So we’ve got a full stack in risk. We’re building a full stack in energy and subsets of energy, so we’re going deeper there. And it’s a scalable model for the future because we now understand how to build these verticals. Either we can mine The Wall Street Journal for new verticals because we see what people gravitate to and where we have the expertise, and then build on that. We can inorganically add as well, or we can organically start outside The Wall Street Journal newsroom.
So going deeper, going wider, and then connecting everything. Let’s go back to the Rubik’s Cube, if you want to buy that whole Rubik’s Cube, we will also make that possible for you. So we’re making sure that these magnificent data pools are going to be available. Some of this is, of course, still in the works but going to be available to our journalists so that they can do exclusive work with it.
You’re describing Dow Jones as something that makes really high-quality, rigorous information across newspapers, magazines, and data products and that sits within News Corp. How often do you hang out with [Founder] Rupert Murdoch?
I wouldn’t put it in the category of hanging out whatsoever. There’s healthy, friendly interaction. He’s chairman emeritus, he’s built the caricature on the side. He’s built enormous media success stories over time. And so, from a business point of view, there was a lot to learn from him, certainly in my early days, like, “How do you create businesses?” But from News Corp, there’s been nothing but support for our growth story.
So I’m very thankful for that. It’s Rupert, it’s [Chair] Lachlan [Murdoch], and also [CEO] Robert Thompson, that’s a whole apparatus. But we also have access to capital as Dow Jones. Five years ago, we hadn’t done an acquisition for well over a decade. Now we’ve done billions in acquisitions. That support is a vote of confidence for the direction that we’re taking, for the strategy that I outlined to you: growing deeper, growing wider, connecting things. There’s also a deep respect for the independence of The Wall Street Journal and the value that comes with that. I’ve seen that consistently applied. So yeah, that’s my answer to your hangout question.
Rupert Murdoch plays on both sides of the information crisis. You can watch his other properties create whatever reality is politically expedient for Donald Trump. And then I see The Wall Street Journal rigorously cover the impact of tariffs all the way down to the opinion pages, which sometimes say the tariffs are bad.
Oh no, the opinion pages don’t just say tariffs are bad. Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau said in a press conference — I’m paraphrasing here — “I don’t often quote The Wall Street Journal, but they said that this trade war is the stupidest trade war in history.” Something along those lines. We don’t hold back. Our opinion pages don’t hold back, and their assessment is based on well-established principles of free markets and free people. The independence to make that judgment is core to who we are. For my part, I’m focused on the Dow Jones part, of making sure that sings.
But do you see that contradiction? Do you think your team sees that contradiction, that you’re trying to sell really high-quality information while another part of the structure that has the same ownership is contributing to an information crisis?
Listen, I can’t comment because of the shared ownership structure. I’m not going to comment on my colleagues at Fox. We had protesters outside in Fox Square, and people are protesting while the reporters at The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones are doing their jobs. So, there is an awareness of the perception of Fox and what we’re focused on. I think there’s also a great awareness amongst our staff, and has been for over 15 years, that those two things are separate — without specifically commenting on how you characterize that, because I am just not going to get into that.
That makes sense. I want to ask the last Decoder question, and I want to end by talking about AI at length. You’ve had to make a lot of decisions. You’ve changed the way the company works a lot. You obviously have a way of thinking about the company that’s very specific. Although I will say that Rubik’s Cubes are meant to be solved. I think you want them to remix the cube, not solve it. But what’s your framework there? How do you make decisions?
I take in information a lot. I like to be, probably to a fault, familiar with the facts on the ground, so I am very consultative, take in expertise, and absorb. So, I feel like I have a sufficient level of mastery to then make a decision. So that’s one part. I’m very inquisitive. The strength of good journalists is that they know how to ask questions, and they’re driven by curiosity. As a company, we’re driven by curiosity. As an executive, I’m driven by curiosity. I want to figure out how things interact, to understand the nuances. That’s for my part.
I also, at the same time, believe in letting managers manage or creators create, and making sure that what I’m doing is to help make those managers or those creators successful. It depends on where we’re focused. If we’re focused on something that is important for the whole company, I will be informed and I will make the decision by consulting my management team.
Within the framework of the strategy that I’ve outlined and the intricacies of that, I am a firm believer in letting the managers make decisions. So, I have a very flat structure where there is a lot of autonomy to, within that framework, make decisions. I think that allows people to move faster and allows the company to move faster. It allows us to experiment without going through a central clearinghouse constantly. So, I want both. On the one hand, I want the expertise so I’m informed. There’s a limit to that because you can’t do that when you are thinking about everything’s macro issues. I have to be judicious in how I do that, where I focus that thirst. On the other hand, we have that flat structure and empower people.
Let’s apply that framework to AI. I think it’s useful to have the framework where we talk about this next set of big shifts because that’s a lot of decisions. You mentioned Factiva earlier. That’s a data platform. You’re promising some generative AI tools there. You want to offer more of those tools to your customers across the board. You’ve made some deals with OpenAI, but at the same time, you’re suing Perplexity.
You think it’s taking information away without compensating you. You made a deal with OpenAI at some rate, we can talk about whether that rate is enough. And then you’re offering the tools to the users. What is the shape of the AI opportunity to you? When you look at that whole set, the number one question to me is, “How big of a business is this really?” Because I don’t know if anyone’s making more money from AI than they’re spending on building the tools right now.
We are in a very, very early stage in that, so it’s hard to say. What I can say is that on the product side, some of our products outperform versus what we had planned for them. We have a product in our risk business called Integrity Check. It’s more of a self-serve model where you don’t have to wait for Dow Jones to get back to you and do its computation — using AI ourselves but out of the view of the customer. Instead, we’re having the customer do some basic research on risk and compliance themselves, assessing who they can do business with, and getting that to an 80 percent reliability. From there, they use that as a springboard to say, “Now, with the remaining 20 percent, I need help from the company.” 
That product is fairly young, and that’s outperforming expectations. On the whole, I think this will be a net positive, but we’ve got to unpack what we’re talking about first. We’ve got to get the foundational elements of this right. If we don’t have proprietary information that is truly proprietary, then we’re going to lose this game. You see us engage in building products, building a marketplace with Factiva, and deploying tools internally, but all of that has to happen in tandem with solving that foundational question.
Last summer, the deal with OpenAI, the reporting was that it’s worth about $250 million. Is that correct?
Read The Wall Street Journal.
That’s The Wall Street Journal’s side, so I believe them. I had Nicholas Thompson, the CEO of The Atlantic on the show a few months ago. He told me one of the reasons that he made a deal with OpenAI was to set the market rate, which is useful for fair-use litigation and for other kinds of deals. Do you think $250 million is enough of a rate to set the market?
I’m not going to talk about specific amounts, but you’ve got to ask what the amount is for. What I am personally less interested in is a single amount and more in an operating model and a business model for how you do business over a long period of time. How does that operate? When information is used, is the value of that information recognized along the way, and is there a mechanism that helps in realizing that valuation?
Set the dollars aside, inside of the OpenAI deal, what are the signals you’re looking for that indicate whether the deal was a success or a failure?
Simply because of the way we’ve set up that deal. I’m not going to talk specifically about it. That was a super nice try because I almost bit. 
I’m going to try it again, don’t worry.
I’m sure you will. I can talk more broadly. How can you tell the generative AI tools that you’re deploying or the models that you’re deploying within your own business are successful? That’s by usage. Is it generating revenue on a consistent basis? Is it just a blurb? Like, “ It’s a novelty factor, and now we move on?” We’re pretty early in that process, so I don’t know yet what’s a head fake and what’s real. Some of the products, I can tell, are real. Some of it requires a shift in user experience and user requirements. This is going to have to be table stakes, like offering a UX that is built around generative AI because the customer expects that. So, you’re getting at the trickiness of establishing the value writ large.
But overall, I think of generative AI as an accelerant for the strategy that we have. It will allow us to go deeper in our verticals faster and more efficiently, and in ways that we couldn’t even imagine. We’ve all talked about the wonders of generative AI, in doing research in ways that we couldn’t do before, human and otherwise. Within Dow Jones, we talk about authentic intelligence. That’s the combination of generative AI and human guidance. We find that that’s a sweet spot for certain B2B products that we’re building.
It’s accelerating, going deeper. It will accelerate going wider, i.e., scaling our vertical strategy because we can stand up verticals much faster. If it’s a geographic vertical, we can now say, “All right, we can launch in this language, and it’s so reliable and it’s a lot cheaper.” And then connecting everything, generative AI is a massive accelerant because now with a thin layer on top, we can extract data from all these different data pools.
Do the tools work well enough for you to trust it?
On a case-by-case basis, when it’s very specific and we are answering a question from a customer. If it’s a co-creation where we are solving a certain problem and we have very narrow parameters, then I think it works. When you go wide, you get a wide answer. So, our strategy is built around being specific and being focused on verticals. AI fits nicely with that, and in fact, it allows us to go much deeper, be much more specific, and be more discerning. Under each vertical, you can create sub-verticals using a much larger data pool.
You’re describing something that happens within Dow Jones and its products. More broadly, News Corp has been pretty harsh about platforms and work. News Corp CEO Robert Thompson is famously critical of Google, in part resulting in the laws in Australia that require platforms to pay publishers for linking. AI represents that opportunity as well, or that challenge as well. Instead of using your tools, someone might use a ChatGPT or a Google Gemini, and just receive an answer. Do you think that these deals you’re making are hedges against that outcome? Are they investments in that outcome? 
I’ll just give the example of the millennial digital media startup boom, which was predicated on “we will just be the most viral thing on Facebook, and Facebook will pay us that money.” That obviously did not pan out. I think people are very wary of making that same mistake with AI. But you have one of these deals.
This is why I said at the very start that I see those deals in a separate category. It’s foundational, it’s about principles. The money to be made in AI, it’s really on us to make sure–
So it’s on your proprietary tools?
It’s on us that what our generative AI spits out is relevant to our customer in a way that some other provider with maybe a more general offer is not. We have to make sure that when we combine our proprietary journalism, our proprietary data, and our convening power with generative AI and LLMs, that the outcome to a query is A, reliable, and B, something that you can’t find somewhere else or be at the scale of where you can find it somewhere else within that vertical. I think there’s a distinction between establishing the principles and getting value for that, getting forward value if you are being used. Then, there is a separate category of efficiency tools that we use in the company.
Yet, there’s another category where we say, “Here’s where we build products that have to answer a certain question that exists in the market in any industry.” We’re going to give a superior answer, and you’re going to need that answer in order to be more successful than the next person working on solving that problem in a certain industry. So, if that’s about forecasting energy prices, we want to be the most reliable on that. We want to be the leading voice on what’s happening in the chemical industry, and generative AI should be one way in which you get that out of us, but in a proprietary sense. 
That should be, hopefully, very different from going to any chatbot and asking that same question. Maybe you get an approximation, but it might not be as reliable. Hopefully, there’ll be sufficient proprietary data in our answer that will make that competition uneven to our advantage. That I think is the task. I feel very strongly that we cannot go into this new era with a view of, “Well, this is what these companies have to do for us.” We have to agree on the principles and the value, but then it’s really up to us to create superb products and answers to complex questions in a very complex world, to realize the value that these new tools offer. Both those things have to exist.
I’ve talked to a lot of publishers and media CEOs over the past several years about where the traffic comes from, how the payments work, where the value is going. Setting aside AI for a minute, it feels like the nuclear question everyone is asking is if Google is just indexing our sites and taking the data, eventually we will have to block Google in a way that many publishers were comfortable using their robots.txt file to block OpenAI and other crawlers. Have you ever considered going that far?
I’m not going to speak specifically to Google. We’re partners and we have lots of things that we do together. There’s also things that we disagree on.
News Corp has famously been the most outspoken on this. That’s why I was comfortable asking the question.
Absolutely. This is not on my radar in the way that you express that, but that’s the short answer to that. Taking your question in a different way, we have to emphasize owned-and-operated. We have to make sure that being in our world — in our universe, in an individual vertical, in one of our broader products, or in the entire Rubik’s Cube — you have an experience that you cannot have somewhere else. That’s on us. How far do you go? It’s about putting a wall around that. Yeah, we’ll see over time.
You are in litigation against Perplexity. It’s taken some data. I’m guessing by the fact that the lawsuit was filed, you didn’t like that. If you win that case, The New York Times Company wins its case against OpenAI, or, I don’t know, Sheryl Crow wins her case, that will upend the market as we understand it. There will be some new fair-use precedent that is created. How does that change how you think about building and deploying your own AI tools?
Again, I put this in a separate box. We’ve got to build our–
Well wait, let me challenge you on that for one second, just to get it into the right framework. Right now, it feels like the entire industry is just assuming that, win or lose in these cases, the money will be sorted out and labeled to build at the same rate we’ve been building. Maybe the rates go up, and it’s just more expensive to do what OpenAI is doing because it has to pay all the singer-songwriters in the world. It also seems to me that potentially, the rates are so high that the entire structure of the industry changes.
The industry, in this case, is AI.
The AI industry changes. Suddenly, the compliance cost of making sure all of our data is licensed before we feed it into the model for training skyrockets because the penalties are high under copyright law. That feels like an under-considered risk. These lawsuits are just going to play out and something will happen.
The way that I think Google was able to roll over the Viacom lawsuit when YouTube started or the Google Books lawsuit was because it was sort of the plucky upstart. The value of those tools was so high that it got to win a bunch of lawsuits. I don’t think the AI companies feel like plucky upstarts. I don’t think that public sentiment is with a bunch of giant tech company billionaires anymore. It feels like those lawsuits might go the other way. At that point, some of the tools you are using to build with or some of the partners you have, their cost structures might change so dramatically–
That that is going to stop us from that development.
That everyone’s strategy has to change. I’m just wondering how much you’re considering that.
I see where you’re going with it. It’s a little bit of the blind man and the elephant. There are different patches of fair use that different legal cases are pursuing. One case might reverberate, but it’s not going to necessarily be absolute. I hate to say this as an answer to any question, but it’s a big wait and see. 
At the moment, I have to go on the assumption that as a technology, generative AI is present in my world, is going to be present even more, and is going to be an expectation from consumers, whether they’re corporate or consumers out in the wild. So, we cannot continue to build and then think at the same time about how it may all just disappear. And by the way, we might be the culprit because we’re applying that, which is... it’s an interesting scenario. I don’t think it will play out that way. 
But you’re one of the litigants. That’s what I mean. It’s interesting. 
But I don’t know that it will be debilitating. I don’t think that the commercial agreement we have with OpenAI — with the value of which I can’t say but you cited — has stopped it from developing. I believe in a market mechanism, and I think that’s where we will end up, that there will be a gravitation to that rather than stopping the industry in its tracks.
OpenAI famously has not made $1 in profit. It has to build a business that’s valuable enough to support these deals. 
Yeah, but Amazon didn’t for a long time either.
I feel like we’ve brought up Jeff Bezos in a variety of ways on this episode. [Laughs] I’m very curious to see how your lawsuit plays out with Perplexity and how those businesses develop. We’ll have to have you back as that progresses. There’s something there that feels almost invisible. You’re right, the blind man and the elephant. It’s there, it’s very big, and I think this next year, we’ll see how it shapes the business.
I want to end by talking about press freedom. It’s something you care about a lot, you’ve talked about it a lot. You’re a publisher of The Wall Street Journal. You famously had Evan Gershkovich detained in Russia in March 2023. You worked very hard across a number of administrations to bring him back. This is a very challenging time for press freedom, both abroad and it feels like in the United States. What’s your view of the landscape right now?
We live in a time of tremendous change, of polarization, and that makes covering the news trickier than ever before. It also, I think, increases the value and the contribution that we bring to society as a free press. With all the changes and challenges that we’re seeing, including against the media, this is a time that any journalist should be made for. If your heart is in explaining complexity to the world, then there’s never been a time when we’ve had this to grapple with.
On the one hand, we can offer enormous value, and on the other hand, it’s become a lot harder to do that. The statistics around the world don’t lie. There are well over 300 people who were killed last year doing journalism, and people being put in prison. There is a harsh dialogue in society that makes it, under many circumstances, less comfortable to go after a story. Sometimes I measure whether we did a story well by how much I got in terms of complaints from the left and the right after certain stories. So, the temperature is high.
Let me push you on that too. That’s an old chestnut in journalism, right? If everyone’s unhappy, you’re doing your job right.
It’s also my daily existence, honestly. So, it’s a very young chestnut for me. It’s there every day, but yes, I know where you want to go.
This is a pretty asymmetric information landscape right now. One side is vastly more willing to lie. One side is vastly more willing to even change the data. The Trump administration is making noise that it’ll take government spending out of GDP, which would dramatically change almost everything The Wall Street Journal does, right? 
At the most fundamental level, we might not be able to trust government data anymore. That’s a threat to press freedom, and it will spin it as a good thing. Elon Musk is out there trying to spin this as a good thing. You don’t see the left playing that kind of game with the data to metaphysically create political outcomes. There’s not as much trying to tweet things into reality that Elon is doing.
I’m not going to left-right things in this conversation. What I can say is how you respond to an information ecosystem, or maybe in an asymmetrical manner —
I’m saying, how do you respond to an information ecosystem where Donald Trump has threatened to sue pollsters in Iowa because he didn’t like the results of their poll? Or where Brendan Carr, the Chairman of the FCC, is potentially holding up the CBS Skydance merger over his investigation of 60 Minutes’ editorial content?
There’s a very clear answer to that. It’s not an easy answer, but the first answer is stick to your principles. In our case, we believe in reporting the facts in the newsroom. We believe in free markets and free people on the opinion side. You stick to that and you do not let go. And you double down on that. That’s our contribution to the information ecosystem, and we’re going to do more of that. 
That’s a demand-driven thing as well, but we’re talking about press freedom. This is an answer to that. If you start making concessions in your reporting and omitting facts that you know to be true or start self-censoring, then that game is lost.
Second, you’ve got to keep a cool head. We live in an environment where taunting and provocation is the norm. You can take that bait or you cannot. Then, you have to then, in my view, not be hysterical in response to every little provocation that might exist. In fact, you might get more respect if you do not respond to every provocation.
Then, you have to recognize the moments when principles are at stake, when you have to fight or express your disagreement. So, keep on doing what you’re doing. Do even more of it, in our case. Create reliable information. It’s going to be good for society, it’s going to be good for you as an organization. Keep a cool head and stick to your principles.
That last part is also non-negotiable. All these three, in fact, are non-negotiable. You’ve got to stick to your principles. If you start shifting and making certain concessions at the wrong moment, there will be a very high price to pay for that.
You have colleagues in similar positions across the media that are making concessions. ABC settled its case with the Trump administration. Looks like CBS might settle the 60 Minutes case because the threat of the Skydance deal being blocked hangs over it in some way. Are you saying you would not make those concessions? Are you saying they should not?
I am not saying either one of those because I’m not commenting on their individual situations. I just think that there are moments where, as an organization, you’re going to have to evaluate. The AP just went through this. Is this a moment where I speak out and where I stick to my guns or not? I think in those moments, you better choose carefully. You better have a clear view of your principles, understand what you actually stand for, and understand the ramifications. People will point back to certain moments, and you want to make sure that you were on the right side.
I’m going to ask you this more directly because I think I just need to hear it therapeutically, but I think your reporters probably need to hear it too. If the pressure comes to you from the Trump administration, are you saying that you’ll fight when it feels like a lot of other big media companies are choosing to cave?
The question is just too loaded, in that you make it very specific. We have fought for our principles for decades. We have stood up for our reporting for decades. We have a legal team that is incredibly strong, that has fought for press freedom and for our journalism again and again. If we make a mistake, we correct it. We own up to that. That is absolutely part of the value structure. We stand up for principles, period.
What happens if the generative AI makes a mistake?
It depends on what mistake it is. Actually, in building and co-creating some of these products that answer very narrow questions, we were sometimes surprised at mistakes that snuck in. We want to make sure we don’t release products without having screened for that. But you’re going to have to correct.
Do you think that an information environment where some of the tools and the institutions are less reliable, or perhaps even openly hostile to the press, is something you will be able to chart as Dow Jones alone? Or do you think that’s an industry-wide effort? Because it does not feel like there’s a lot of coordination across the industry right now.
I think the industry should shoulder a lot of this together in a loosely formed coalition or through solidarity. I’m focused on Dow Jones’ success, but I certainly share our findings with colleagues all the time, and there’s a very active dialogue amongst media leaders that A, I want to foster and B, I want to participate in. If you look at very difficult moments like the Evan case or getting people out of Afghanistan during the U.S. forces’ rapid withdrawal, we worked very, very closely together. There’s very close contacts among a lot of those leaders. I think that’s a healthy thing, and I would like to see more of it.
Almar, you’ve given us so much time. Tell us what’s next for Dow Jones.
Well, it’s tomorrow’s news, so I want you to tune in. Definitely come to The Wall Street Journal every day. For us, you’ll see us focus on international rebalancing. We’re rebalancing our portfolio to make sure that we are as strong outside the borders of the U.S. as we are here. We’re focused on video, focused on deeper data products. Overall, we will continue to be focused on what we have been focused on for the entirety of our existence, and that’s providing reliable information.

    Until this February, I had gainful employment at [redacted FAANG co] doing machine learning engineering for [redacted LLM-related job]. It was a great gig, and I enjoyed the work and my coworkers. However, taking a medium-term look at the market dynamics surrounding my employment prompted me to quit a few weeks ago. I'm now convinced that my former job there will be obsolete by the end of the year.


    For context — I started my career as a backend engineer at a late-stage startup before transitioning into doing ML work for a few early-stage AI startups and finally for FAANGco. It's wild how much change the industry has already undergone since I started my career <5 years ago in 2021. My first job consisted of taking on atomic tasks in the form of Jira tickets that had been assigned points for difficulty and progressively knocking them out, sometimes in the form of pair programming with another engineer (gasp!) If this work model isn't obsolete yet, it certainly feels like a relic of a dying age. Frontier companies' cost per line of code must be approaching 10x cheaper than it was in these days. Most of the microservices repos at my first company could now probably be built in a day by one person with the aid of an advanced coding agent like Claude Code. It's not hard to imagine why the demand for junior devs has all but gone away when most backend work at these sorts of companies now consists of debugging thorny edge cases that only a senior+ level engineer is likely to be able to tackle.


    ML work is different insofar as it requires cost management w.r.t. hardware that is nontrivially expensive, from the perspective of cost, availability, and execution time — even at hyperscalers. For a while, it seemed to me like the high cost of botched experiments would be a saving grace from automation in this field. AI slop code might be fine when it comes to the frontend of your Next.js side project, but when it makes false assumptions that cause silent errors in your training runs, you've got a problem.


    This might continue to be the case for the foreseeable future to some extent, but there are two catches, from the perspective of an ML engineer who would like to keep their job:


    A little while ago, I got the pervasive sense in the SF tech scene that as AI coding gets better, the place you want to be is in a rest-and-vest job with a publicly-traded FAANG company that will let you slowly automate your own job while you collect RSUs.


    Sorry, the Efficient Market Hypothesis is more true than that.


    Right now, most of your engineering job not spent in the IDE consists of writing/clarifying specs, disambiguating them with stakeholders, and checking if things work as intended. These tasks are mostly beyond the capabilities of current models, less because they're fundamentally outside the scope of AI models' cognitive capabilities, and more because they involve navigating internal software, referencing documents, and being able to devise and run reasonable tests on the efficacy of a project, in the context of its desired purpose.


    You don't have to extrapolate the capabilities of current computer-use agents very far at all to imagine them being able to autonomously do this sort of fairly menial context-gathering. As someone with a background in GUI agentsI worked on a startup in the field and consulted for another leading startup that you've definitely heard of, I'd be surprised if we don't have this capability by the end of 2025. At this point, it's about keeping relevant information in context, disregarding some of it when necessary, and knowing where to look to load it back. None of this seems prohibitive for a slightly more advanced version of current agent systems. This isn't even taking into account non-GUI-based tools for providing context to AI agents, like Anthropic's MCP, which could well further speed adoption and accuracy at companies that are on the frontier of these things.


        As a sidenote, one of the key distinctions for agentic systems is whether you're telling them to use first-party or third-party software. Tasks like ""order me a sandwich on the UberEats website"" are fairly likely to get blocked by CAPTCHAs or other bot detection systems if you do them too much (I promise you, you can't fool profiling algorithms at scale unless you're a nation-state actor.) You yourself, however, can make sure that your bots don't get blocked from accessing internal documentation via approved channels. As a result, GUI agents might see much faster adoption for internal tasks than external ones.
    

    All in all, I think the evidence points to a scenario where by the end of this year or next, engineering and other pure knowledge work IC jobs can be mostly done by AI agents, with some fraction of the people who formerly held those IC jobs acting as de facto product managers cum infrastructure janitors for agent swarms.


    On one hand, this is great! We'll have essentially infinite working software at a price of ≈$0/line of code. The actual job of being an AI agent product manager cum infrastructure janitor, however, sounds awfully boring to me personally. That's why I quit my FAANG job a few weeks ago.


    Contrary to what some tech people seem to think, there are factors of production other than intelligence. There may even be factors of production that are intrinsically tied to being a human, outside of the raw intelligence outputted by some people's brains. For the time being, those non-intelligence factors should retain economic value.


    If you have a knowledge work IC job and are not interested in being an AI agent wrangler, where you go from here is obviously closely tied to your personal attributes and skills. To help get a clearer picture of what those are, I suggest talking to a language model. Specifically, I'd brainstorm jobs such that even if they could be done very well by AI systems, people wouldn't want to use AI systems to do them.


    You always can stay on as an AI wrangler, of course. But for me, part of the appeal of getting into a profession like engineering was the intellectual challenge of using intelligence to solve problems, and it seems to be specifically the intelligence part of the job that's most directly in the line of fire for automation. Humans aren't defined by their intelligence, of course, but they're certainly not defined by their unique capacity to be infrastructure janitors for AI agents either.


    Personally, I think some types of sales jobs fall under the category of ""even if they could be done by AI agents, nobody would want them to be."" It's broadly in the rational economic interestsocial proof against scamming for the buyer; price discrimination for the seller of both buyer and seller that there be a human in the loop at this phase of the deal lifecycle. So the next step in my career is going to be talking to people about great AI products that are being built and helping them figure out if they'd find these products useful. If you're building a great product and would like somebody to tell people about it, please don't hesitate to reach outmy email is my name, Jasper Gilley, at gmail dot com, all lowercase!

Welcome back! A product manager has some advice for junior employees: Be the dumbest person in the room. Asking questions and listening rather than trying to tout your knowledge is the best bet.

        This will be my last edition for a bit, as I'll be on parental leave until May. But don't sweat it! You're in the very capable hands of my UK colleague Hallam Bullock while I am out. The only thing you'll need to change is to imagine a posh British accent while you're reading it.
    

        In today's big story, people are getting worried about a potential recession. Here's how to protect yourself.
    

What's on deck


Markets: Find out what the PE giants are paying.
    

Tech: Everyone wants to get rid of low performers, but doing so might not be as beneficial as you think.
    

Business: Older Americans told us how they've traded in their white collars for blue ones to make ends meet.
    

        But first, protect ya neck.

The economy might take a dive, but you don't have to let it take you down with it.


        After a few months of everyone being excited about what the future could hold for the US economy, things have taken a noticeable turn. Scary words like ""recession"" and ""stagflation"" are getting thrown around, and the only thing that seems certain under the current administration is more uncertainty.
    

        It's the kind of environment that can make your head spin. Lucky for you, we turned to the experts. Business Insider's Matthew Fox got advice from financial planners about what you can do to prepare for the worst. (And no, they're not just telling you to put your money in bonds.)
    

        In fact, the best advice is more emotional than financial: Don't panic. When times get tough, people tend to want to react. But the reality is that markets move quickly, especially these days, and you don't want to get caught selling off assets amid what could just be a mini downturn.
    

        Besides, if the economy does go south, you might be better off leaning into the chaos instead of pulling away. I am not a financial advisor, so don't take this as advice, but history has proven that those who were willing to buy the dips usually benefited in the long run.
    

But how did we get here in the first place?


        Just a few months ago, things seemed ready to take off. The S&P 500 was setting record highs. Bankers were licking their chops at the potential deal flow. Everyone was ready to rock.
    

        The market has been singing a different tune for the past few weeks.
    

        Plenty of people are pointing their fingers at tariffs. Trump's will-he-won't-he trade plan has become a guessing game investors don't seem interested in playing anymore.
    

        However, BI's Filip De Mott said that's not the only thing derailing stocks. The deregulation expected under Trump and his embrace of crypto haven't led to boons in industries just yet.
    

        The key is that last bit: just yet. The administration has been in place for less than two months. A lot could still shake out. Investors' willingness to wait, though, remains to be seen.
    
Russia's arms exports are going bust as foreign buyers bolt and the Ukraine war chews through its weapons.
1. Private equity paydays. To get a pulse on how much people make in PE, BI combed through job listings and H-1B visa data for a dozen firms, including Blackstone, Apollo, and KKR. The good news: Salaries are steep, and an Odyssey Search Partners survey found bonuses can lead bigwigs to expect compensation upward of $1 million a year. The bad news: Pay growth has generally stabilized.
2. This tax season, don't bring the IRS to your door. While the IRS will often automatically correct small errors and typos, glaring mistakes can result in costly penalties. Avoid these four common IRS audit triggers for a smoother tax filing season.
3. The US government now has a bitcoin reserve. President Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a strategic bitcoin reserve, but, Peter Kafka writes, it's unclear what it's supposed to do and why the US should have one. The US already owns a bunch of bitcoin, and many crypto fans thought the Trump plan would be to go out and buy more. That doesn't appear to be the case now.
1. How parts of the US will track abortion pills. Last May, Louisiana reclassified misoprostol and mifepristone — both commonly used to induce abortions — as ""controlled substances,"" allowing prescriptions to be monitored. This designation is typically applied to drugs with a risk of abuse. Tech companies, like Bamboo Health, can make big money running states' prescription monitoring databases. BI found that, while designed to investigate doctors for wrongdoing, these programs can have wider implications for clinicians and their patients.
2. Agentic AI is coming to the military. Scale AI, the $13.8 billion startup helmed by Alexandr Wang, secured a DOD contract to integrate AI agents into military decision-making. The contract is the first of its kind and cements the partnership between tech and the military.
3. Actually, you need those low performers. Big Tech companies like Meta and Microsoft have instituted brutal performance-based cuts this year, making 2025 the de facto year of the low performer. But in reality, that management tactic hurts business in the long run. An initial surge in productivity is offset by loss of quality, morale, and, ultimately, profitability.
1. Another twist in the Baldoni-Lively saga. Three days before Justin Baldoni sued The New York Times, someone paid $120 to boost content about an emoji that was a key part of Baldoni's suit. The payment's timing suggests the client knew just how important that emoji would become before it was publicly revealed in the filing.
2. Federal workers clap back (subtly). Snarky emails, spoon emojis, and pronouns. These are some of the ways federal workers are subtly protesting workforce cuts and demands from President Trump, Elon Musk, and DOGE while also keeping their jobs. They told BI they've found comfort in banding together with their colleagues along the way.
3. Some older Americans turn to blue-collar jobs. Side hustles and blue-collar work have kept some former white-collar professionals afloat as they navigate the job market. BI heard from dozens of these older Americans who've struggled with landing roles after a layoff. Lower pay, a need for specialized qualifications, and rsum dilemmas are among the challenges.
Trump handed these two Chinese e-commerce companies a double win — for now.

26,2025-03-10,"JBL is on a quest to build the perfect speaker. Itâs an impossible quest, of course, but every iteration, it seems to inch ever closer to the finish line. Case in point, the JBL Flip 7. At first glance, itâs a run-of-the-mill speaker. But not only is it lighter than its predecessor, itâs more durable, with more powerful bass and redesigned tweeters. The result is a speaker that punches well above its weight class, pumping out loud, clear audio that rivals devices twice its price point.
There are a couple of flies in the ointment, such as weak bass on some songs. And the speaker can move on its own when belting out the tunes if it isnât positioned properly. But for the mid-tier price of $130, the JBL Flip 7 will be sitting on quite a few best Bluetooth speakers lists this year.
You can pre-order the Flip 7 for $150 on JBLâs website with an expected ship date of April 6. The pricing is competitive and puts it in line with the Bose Soundlink Flex (2nd Gen) ($150), the Anker Soundcore Boom 2 ($130), and the Beats Pill ($130).
JBL Flip 7
The JBL Flip 7 squeezes premium sound into a compact, durable shell
Pros
Cons
Speakers like the Flip 7 are practically begging to be the star of your next picnic, beach romp, or cookout. To that end, JBL made the potent portable pretty darned tough. Not only is the Flip 7 waterproof (30 minutes in 1 meter [3 feet] of freshwater), the IP68 certified speaker is also dust and drop-proof (up to 1 meter on concrete or hardwood). That rating makes the Flip 7 one of the most durable portable speakers available, so you best believe it can withstand a few bruises and scrapes.
When it launches, the Flip 7 will be available in six colorways (white, black, purple, camo, red, and blue). JBL sent us the white version of the speaker, which is a bit tame for my tastes, but itâll still look good no matter the setting. Most of the speakerâs exterior is made of a grayish-white fabric thatâs 100% recycled. The plastic parts of the exterior and some of the speakerâs interior are made of 75% post-consumer recycled plastic. The Flip 7âs endcaps are silvery white with a metallic exclamation point in the center. The JBL logo is the only other metallic component on the speaker. The silver emblem, outlined in red, sits front and center, proudly on display.
Buttons for volume and play/pause sit at the top of the speaker, protruding ever so slightly out of the fabric lining. Thereâs a small console directly behind that holds the power, Bluetooth, and Auracast buttons. Look a little farther back on the speaker and youâll find the USB-C charging port next to the a gray lanyard that can be exchanged for a carabiner via JBLâs new PushLock system. Itâs pretty straightforward. Just push and hold the gray button to release whatever is currently attached (in this case, the gray lanyard), slide whatever accessory you want in via the metal clasp, and release the button. I vigorously swung the speaker around with both the lanyard and the carabiner, and both held firm.
I tossed the 19.68-pound, 7.2 x 2.7 x 2.6-inch Flip 7 into my bookbag, where it quickly became an afterthought. Itâs much lighter than the Boom 2 (11.7 x 7.3 x 3.95 inches) at 58.4 ounces, and The Pill (8.6 x 2.8 x 2.8 inches) and Soundlink Flex (2.1 H x 7.9 W x 3.56 inches) were also heavier, at 24 and 20.8 ounces, respectively. The Flip is only slightly heavier than its predecessor at 19.36 ounces, but itâs also slightly bigger than the Flip 6, which measured ââ7 x 2.6 x 2.8 inches.
Any features the Flip 7 has are accessed via the free JBL Portable app. Itâs light on features compared to other companion apps. You get an equalizer with four presets, plus the ability to create your own sound with the custom option. JBL Portable is also where youâll interact with PlaytimeBoost, a feature that extends the speakerâs battery life by disabling the EQ while boosting volume.
The Flip 7 is also one of the latest devices to tout Auracast technology, a new way to share audio across devices. Comprised of transmitters, receivers, and assistants, Auracast devices can share audio with an unlimited number of in-range compatible devices. Think of it like AM or FM radio, but for Bluetooth. With Auracast, the Flip 7 can connect with another Flip 7 to create a wider stereo soundstage with the PartyTogether feature. When the feature is simultaneously broadcasting a playlist to unlimited Auracast-enabled receivers. I discovered that you can do a bit of mix and match, as I successfully bridged the Flip 7 and Charge 6 using PartyTogether.
Whatever you do, donât underestimate the power of this speaker. When the moment of truth came, and I cranked the Flip 7 to max volume and started streaming music, it knocked me for the proverbial loop. You really have to hear to believe the amount of knock this slim cylinder pumps out. JBL upgraded the bass and gave the tweeter dome a redesign that definitely make a difference. Combine that with AI Boost, JBLâs proprietary tech which the company says analyzes your music in real time to deliver the optimal performance with the least amount of distortion.
I spent two hours listening to different genres of music (Hip-Hop, Rock, R&B, Country, Jazz, Alternative, etc.), and I have to say I was seriously impressed. It was fun watching the endcaps vibrate with all that air being pushed through bass radiators. Just be sure to position the speaker so itâs standing on its tiny foot. Otherwise, all that vibration will move the speaker out of its original position.
There were a few cases of mild distortion; the upper chords of Diane Krallâs Live cover of âFly Me To The Moonâ was brighter than I like. And while youâll definitely get deep bass on most tracks, on songs like Kendrick Lamarâs âSquabble Up,â the low end felt hollow. But man, nine times out of ten, the Flip 7 was on point with a generous soundstage with clean balanced audio. I felt like I was center stage partaking in Santanaâs scintillating electric guitar as I listened to âEuropa (Earthâs Song).â And while there is an electric guitar in Amethyst Kiahâs âBlack Myself,â I had no problem hearing the twanging strings of the acoustic guitar.
Another thing to note is the lack of a sweet spot. No matter where I positioned myself in my living room in relation to the Flip 7, there was never a point that I wasnât getting a full soundstage. And although the app offers several EQ presets, most listeners will be fine with the default JBL Signature setting.
According to JBL, you can squeeze about 14 hours of music playback out of the Flip 7âs 4,800mAh battery. You can get an additional two hours of charge if you enable PlaytimeBoost. This feature boosts the volume but saves battery life by disabling the equalizer. Itâs a cool feature for those looking to party until the cows come home. And for those looking to party right out the box, youâll be pleased to learn the Flip 7 shipped with 70% battery life.
I streamed my main Spotify playlist, which has 335 hours and 42 minutes of music to the Flip 7 at 50% volume. The speaker lasted 13 hours and 29 minutes without the PlaytimeBoost enabled.
You review enough products for enough years and you run the risk of becoming jaded. And then you come across something like the JBL Flip 7. At first glance, it looks like most portable Bluetooth speakers on the market. But look beyond its fabric shell and youâve got a speaker that punches well above its price point. Itâs one of the most durable Bluetooth speakers on the market and uses a fair amount of sustainable materials.
And while thatâs all well and dandy, itâs the sound that makes the Flip 7 a winner. Seriously, something this compact has no business delivering audio that full or loud. Sure, youâll encounter a little distortion on some songs and weak bass. But with the redesigned tweeter domes, upgraded bass, and JBLâs proprietary AI Boost technology, those moments are few and far between. Instead, the Flip 7 produces a warm, vibrant audio with a generous soundstage with over 13 hours of battery life. And if you need even more party time, enable PlaytimeBoost to add two additional hours to ensure the party doesnât stop until youâre good and ready. Overall, the JBL Flip 7 is a fantastic Bluetooth speaker that offers premium sound at a mid-tier price.

27,2025-03-10,"The JBL Charge 6 has some big shoes to fill. Its predecessor, the Charge 5, consistently got high marks for its durability, utility, endurance, and of course, its audio performance. Thankfully, the Charge 6 has things well in hand. The speaker is currently one of the most durable Bluetooth speakers on the market. And as the name suggests, you can still top off your smartphone or tablet when its batteryâs low. Speaking of battery, the Charge 6 now packs a full day of charge plus four hours with the Playtime Boost feature, and itâs got fast charge. And with Auracast, the Charge 6 can share audio with an unlimited number of devices.
And what about that audio? Accused in past iterations of being a bass monster, the Charge 6 takes a more measured approach to audio. Yes, the bass is definitely there, with the ability to send tiny little aural shivers down your spine. But itâs not so much that the mids and lows get lost. In fact, the Charge 6 presents a fairly balanced performance with a generous soundstage. Are there moments when thereâs a little distortion? Sure, but theyâre few and far between, which is impressive, especially for a speaker this size that only costs $200.
In short, if youâre looking for a portable speaker thatâs big on both sound and value, you owe it to yourself to check out the JBL Charge 6.
JBL Charge 6
The JBL Charge 6 offers impressive audio performance with nearly 30 hours of battery life
Pros
Cons
The Charge 6 is available for pre-order now on JBLâs website for $200 with a ship date of April 6. That price point puts the JBL on a par with the UE Megaboom 4 ($200) and the Sonos Roam 2 ($180). The Bose Soundlink Max is a pricier proposition at $400.
With its handle attached, the Charge 6 looks like a funky purse, to the point where I can envision myself dressed to the nines carrying it as such. Just like its little brother, the Flip 7, the Charge 6 is an environmentally friendly piece of tech. The black fabric exterior is made from 100% recycled fabric, while the plastic throughout the device comprises 85% post-consumer recycled plastic. And with a durability rating of IP68, itâs one of toughest S.O.B.s on the market. In addition to being water and dust proof, the speaker can withstand drops of up to 1 meter onto concrete or hardwood.
Like its predecessors, the Charge 6 has the JBL logo prominently displayed on the front. Outlined in red, the lettering has an almost 3D-like effect. The speaker’s endcaps are made of semi-transparent plastic with a big, honking exclamation mark. Just above the JBL logo are raised, hard plastic buttons for volume control and play/pause with a small console for Auracast, power, and Bluetooth. The two divots flanking the buttons are a clear giveaway on where the strap is attached. Iâm not going to lie, I was a little worried about the thin plastic strip holding the strap in place, but Iâve shaken the bejesus out of this thing with no ill effects.
Thereâs a USB-C port in the back that you can use to either charge the speaker or a device thatâs running low on juiceâhence the name. You can connect the Charge 6 to a laptop, smartphone, or tablet and get some Lossless audio going if youâre an audiophile with discerning tastes. Finally, thereâs a pair of feet along the bottom to keep it from toppling over.
Weighing 33.8 ounces, the 9 x 3.9 x 3.7-inch Charge 6 is a chunky thing. Itâs not as hefty as the Soundlink Max (4.7 x 10.4 x 4.13 inches) which weighs 78.4 ounces. Still, the Megaboom 4 (8.4 x 2.4 x 2.4 inches) and Roam 2 (6.6 x 2.4 x 2.36 inches) are lighter at 32.98 and 15.2 ounces.
Whatâs better than one speaker? Two speakers, of course. Iâve got good news for those looking to expand their speakerâs power. The Charge 6 can pair with another Charge 6 via the PartyTogether feature in the free JBL Portable app for some stereo action. And if you donât have another Charge 6, the technology should work with any PartyTogether-compatible JBL speakers. Plus, since this is an Auracast device, the Charge 6 can broadcast to an unlimited number of compatible devices, provided theyâre in range.
Another prime feature the companion app offers is Playtime Boost, which disables the equalizer while boosting the volume. This results in approximately four additional hours of battery life, which comes in handy for those marathon session parties. And speaking of the EQ, there are four distinct equalizer settings in addition to a custom one you can tweak yourself. Of the options, most people will probably leave it on JBL Signature, which is the default setting.
Cuteness aside, the Charge 6 isnât to be taken lightly. JBLâs been tweaking with the formula, retooling the kit with some of âthe best engineersâ in order to deliver the âmost realistic sound reproduction yet.â The company also added its proprietary AI Boost tech, which delivers optimal audio performance with the least amount of distortion by analyzing your music in real time. I spent two hours streaming from my main Spotify playlist, swapping between a plethora of genres to get a real feel of the speakerâs capabilities. And the Charge 6 did not disappoint.
When I started streaming music to the Charge 6, a song came to mind, EnVogueâs âGiving Him Something He Can Feel,â because JBL did exactly that. Whether I was listening to Janelle Monaeâs âYoga,â âBring Me Joy,â The Layabouts and Portia Monique collab, or Durand Bernarrâs âImpact,â I felt that bass.
The speakerâs powerful vibrations traveled through my desk into my hands and gently caressed my spine. Itâs a nice sensation. But in the midst of that, never did the lows get so aggressive that they submerged the rest of the track. On the contrary, in most cases the Charge 6 employs a nice, wide soundstage that allows just about every piece of a composition to do their thing. I had no problem hearing the tiny plosives from Alanis Morissette on the quieter parts of âIronic.â And Sleepy Brownâs hypnotic baritone seductively oozed from the speaker during âOh Ho Hum.â
There were a couple of missteps, however. A little harsh on the highs, as demonstrated on Kendrick Lamarâs âheart pt. 6ââthe strings sounded congested, I almost lost the organ in the background. It was a similar story with the background vocals on No Doubtâs classic âSpiderwebs.â Still, smaller audio points like claps, maracas, trilling keys, and snaps were fully present.
I was pleased to see the Charge 6 shipped with 65% battery life. JBL estimates the Charge 6âs 4,722mAH battery can last a full day playing music. And if you throw in Playtime Boost, that time jumps to 28 hours, which is quite impressive. Without Playtime Boost enabled, I managed to run the Charge 6 down in 23 hours and 42 minutes at 50% volume. And when itâs time to charge the speaker, it should only take three hours to achieve a full charge. If youâre strapped for time, 10 minutes will get you 150 minutes of music playback, give or take.
The Charge 6 has that moniker for a reason. Because in addition to pumping out a tasty lick or two, the speaker can also charge a smartphone or tablet. Unfortunately, it canât top off your laptop. Itâs a cool wishlist feature, especially for anyone who plans to tap into the Lossless audio feature when plugged in.
As cute as the JBL Charge 6 is, I wouldnât fault you for assuming it has subpar sound. I would, however, fault you for not going beyond your preconceived notions and taking a listen. Because youâd be missing out on one of the best Bluetooth speakers of the year. And friends donât let friends miss out on great tech.
Hidden beneath that unassuming fabric shell are a powerful mix of woofers, tweeters, and traducers that manage to produce audio thatâs mostly clean, warm, and balanced. And yes, itâs ‘mostly,’ because in a speaker this size, there are going to be some instances where the highs and mids might come in a little hot or the bass gets a little aggressive. But those moments are few and fleeting with the help of JBLâs AI Boost technology.
And then you have ancillary features like Auracast that can turn the speaker into a broadcaster capable of sharing audio with an unlimited number of devices. And for those marathon listening sessions, the Charge can last for almost 30 hours and get right back to jamming with a 10-minute recharge. It can top off a device or two with its built-in powerbank. And when itâs time to go outside, the Charge 6 is tough enough for a little misadventure.
If youâre looking for a portable Bluetooth speaker thatâs tough, powerful, and goes easy on your wallet, the JBL Charge 6 stands heads above the competition.

28,2025-03-10,
29,2025-03-10,"Stock fell Monday morning amid growing concerns about U.S. economic growth. President Donald Trump declined to rule out a recession this year in an interview on Fox News, but said he expects a “period” of transition from the policy changes he’s making.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 423 points, or 0.9% at about 10:35 a.m. in New York, while the S&P 500 dipped 2%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.2%. Last week was the stock market’s worst in two years.
The Magnificent 7 stocks were all lower Monday amid the economic anxiety, with Nvidia (NVDA+2.83%) stock down about 5%. Tesla (TSLA+5.27%) fell about 8.8%, erasing its post-election rally. Anthony Scaramucci predicted to Quartz that Trump will “burn” Elon Musk in six to eight months. Palantir (PLTR+3.02%) stock also declined.
Stocks fell in Hong Kong on Monday after China said consumer prices fell in the January-February period, a sign of continued deflationary pressure.
Here are some stocks to watch today:
Airbnb (ABNB+1.53%) stock was upgraded to a buy at Jefferies, which cited the company’s durable growth and its addition of an “experiences” category.
Bally’s (BALY-2.02%) stock jumped more than 4% after the casino operator made an approximately $150 million recapitalization proposal for Star Entertainment, which would give it notes convertible into at least 50.1% of the Australian company’s shares.
Cognizant (CTSH+0.55%) Technology gained 2.5% on reports that activist investor Mantle Ridge had built a $1 billion stake in the technology services firm.
Coinbase (COIN+5.55%) stock fell more than 10% after S&P Dow Jones Indices left the crypto exchange operator out of S&P 500 index, Bloomberg reported.
Crowdstrike (CRWD+3.93%) stock sank more than 7%, extending the cybersecurity company’s declines after it disclosed weak fiscal 2026 earnings expectations and sluggish revenue growth last week.
All of the Big Four U.S. airlines are down. Their descent is led by Delta and United stocks, both of which plummeted about 8%. The airlines have fallen since mid-February on tariffs news, which may increase aircraft costs, and recession fears, which could affect travel budgets.
Doordash (DASH+3.33%) gave up premarket gains to drop 3.8%. The delivery company’s stock was included in the S&P 500 by S&P Dow Jones Indices.
IBM (IBM+2.25%) shares gained about 1%. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to revive a $1.6 billion award against the company to KKR’s BMC Software, Bloomberg reported. The justices didn’t comment on the decision.
Microchip Technology (MCHP+0.74%) stock fell nearly 11%. The company shed its February gains as part of a broader chip-sector selloff that’s been exacerbated by the chipmaker’s falling revenue and weak margins.
 Oracle (ORCL+2.37%) will release its quarterly earnings after the market closes Monday. The software giant’s performance will be closely watched for insights into its enterprise technology spending and cloud growth. Consensus estimates call for profit of $1.49 per share and revenue of $14.38 billion. The stock fell 4.6% in morning trading ahead of the report.

When I'm planning trips for my family, it's hard to decide whether to visit a new destination or return to an old favorite.

        I've been to more than 60 countries, and while the appeal to see somewhere new is strong, there are a handful of places I can't wait to explore again (and again).
    

        Here are some of my favorites that I feel are underrated and often underappreciated by travelers.

Admittedly, I've never been a car person. If it was up to me, I'd still be driving the 1979 Monte Carlo I learned to drive in. That behemoth had a red-faded-to-pink interior, and I could easily cram all my friends and our cheerleading gear into the back.

        But alas, I married a car guy. If he sees a car's headlights or taillights from a block away, he can name the make, model, and current value on the Kelley Blue Book.
    

        He'd been dreaming of a Tesla for years since he took a road trip in a friend's Model S. ""It's so fast and sleek. And there's so much storage because there's no engine,"" he crooned. As Teslas became more popular, it became like our family's version of the Slug Bug game. ""There's a Tesla!"" our sons would cry from the back of our Nissan Pathfinder.
    

        As more electric vehicles entered the market, we decided to join the club. So, my husband did what he does best — research. After considering Rivians and Polestars, he landed on the Tesla Model Y.
    

        It had a decent range and a great charging infrastructure. Most of our driving was done in the city, but we did take occasional road trips to visit family in Iowa or up north for a family vacation. It also had the needed storage capacity for our family of four, our dog, and luggage for a week away. When we took our first test drive, I also fell in love with the Model Y.
    

        The Tesla came with a learning curve. On our first longer trip, my husband and I experienced a tense 30 miles because we didn't stop to charge when the car told us to. We did the math and figured we could make it to our destination. We did make it— after we turned off the air conditioning and radio and slowed to 40 mph on the interstate to save battery. Luckily, our marriage survived. Needless to say, we always stopped to charge after that.
    

        It also took some practice with one-pedal driving, but I soon loved it. I also enjoyed the acceleration in my Model Y, resulting in my first speeding ticket since 1999. I'm sure the bright red color made me an easy target.
    

        While it was sometimes annoying to stop for a charge on a road trip, we got used to the slight inconvenience and used the time to go for a short walk, peruse strange convenience store wares, and play silly car games.
    

        When we saw the final insurance quote, we thought there had to be a mistake. But no — it really was going to cost almost as much as our monthly grocery bill.
    

        We knew our insurance premiums would be high because we have two young adult son drivers, but we had no idea adding a Tesla would be sell-a-kidney expensive.
    

Electric cars generally cost more to insure than gas vehicles, and Teslas have some of the highest premiums. With our current policy, the Tesla costs over $333 a month, while our gas-powered Audi costs half that.
    

        We've since learned that Teslas are outrageously expensive to insure because they're costly to repair, and the company corners the market on parts. Because the repair process can take a long time, insurance companies are stuck footing the bill for longer-term rentals. We also learned that because Teslas drive so fast, their insurance risk rating is just below that of a performance vehicle.
    

        Of course, we've also had several conversations about the Musk controversy, but at the end of the day our pocketbook and family needs dictate the decision to sell our Tesla this spring.
    

        These are all factors we had no idea we should consider before we made our purchase, but they are definitely on my husband's new list as he researches our next vehicle. Now we're in the market for a plug-in hybrid, as they are a fraction of the price to insure and offer many of the same environmental and cost benefits we enjoyed with our Tesla — especially since most of our driving is within a few miles of our city home.
    

        I'm still not a car person. So while my husband dives into research on plug-in hybrids, I'll be here, hoping our next car is just as easy to drive, is cheap to insure, and — if I'm really lucky — comes in a color that doesn't result in a speeding ticket. I may never get my Monte Carlo back, but at least I'll be driving something that won't require us to take out a second mortgage just for insurance.

ADBE Stock
 
Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is set to report its earnings on Thursday, March 13, 2025. Investors are expected to closely monitor the company’s AI advancements, which has been less than impressive thus far. Analysts predict earnings of $4.97 per share and sales of $5.66 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 11% and 9%, respectively.
The company has $198 Bil in current market capitalization. Revenue over the last twelve months was $22 Bil, and it was operationally profitable with $7.7 Bil in operating profits and net income of $5.6 Bil. While a lot will depend on how results stack up against consensus and expectations, understanding historical patterns might just turn the odds in your favor if you are an event-driven trader. There are two ways to do that: understand the historical odds and position yourself prior to the earnings release, or look at the correlation between immediate and medium-term returns post earnings and position yourself accordingly after the earnings are released. However, for investors who seek lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative, having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, check out our analysis on AVGO Stock To $100?See earnings reaction history of all stocks
Some observations on one-day (1D) post earnings returns:
Additional data for observed 5-Day (5D), and 21-Day (21D) returns post earnings are summarized along with the statistics in the table below.
ADBE 1D, 5D, and 21D returns post-earnings
A relatively less risky strategy (though not useful if correlation is low) is to understand the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns post earnings, find a pair that has highest correlation and execute the appropriate trade. For example, if 1D and 5D show the highest correlation, a trader can position themselves ""long"" for the next 5 days if 1D post-earnings return is positive. Here is some correlation data based on 5-year and 3-year (more recent) history. Note that the correlation 1D_5D refers to correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns.
ADBE Correlation Between 1D, 5D and 21D Historical Returns
Sometimes, peer performance can have influence on post-earnings stock-reaction. In fact, the pricing-in might begin before the earnings are announced. Here is some historical data on past post-earnings performance of Adobe stock compared with stock performance of peers that reported earnings just prior to Adobe. For fair comparison, peer stock returns also represent post-earnings one day (1D) return.

AVGO Stock
 
Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) delivered an impressive 9% stock price gain following an upbeat quarterly performance reported on March 6. The company’s performance was fueled by continued demand for its AI products. With the stock soaring 50% year-over-year and maintaining robust revenue growth averaging 24% over three years, Broadcom surely presents a compelling narrative.
But, here’s the thing, in a downturn, AVGO can lose – no – there is evidence, from as recent as in 2022, that AVGO stock lost as much as 36% of its value over a span of just a few quarters. Now, of course, individual stocks are more volatile than a portfolio – and in this environment if you seek upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Separately, see How ADBE Stock Might React To Upcoming Earnings?
While Broadcom's AI prospects remain promising, substantial macroeconomic headwinds warrant attention. Though inflation concerns have diminished, they haven't disappeared. The current administration's aggressive tariff and immigration policies have rekindled inflation anxieties, potentially signaling economic turbulence ahead.
Risk Factors to Consider
The heightened geopolitical uncertainty stemming from the new administration's bold policy initiatives presents additional challenges. With ongoing conflicts in Ukraine-Russia, trade uncertainties, and strained negotiations with long-standing allies including Canada, Mexico, and Europe, the risk landscape has grown increasingly complex.
Concerning Performance Metrics
Notably, AVGO stock has underperformed the benchmark S&P 500 index during the recent market downturns—a critical consideration for investors evaluating their risk tolerance in today’s volatile environment.
While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes.
Inflation Shock (2022)
• AVGO stock fell 36.3% from a high of $67.09 on 4 January 2022 to $42.71 on 16 October 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500
 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 18 May 2023
 • Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $250.00 on 16 December 2024 and currently trades at around $195
Covid Pandemic (2020)
• AVGO stock fell 46.8% from a high of $31.57 on 19 February 2020 to $16.79 on 18 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500
 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 5 June 2020
In conclusion, while AVGO stock currently enjoys investor enthusiasm driven by significant AI sector expansion, it commands a premium valuation at 30x forward earnings. Consider that despite Broadcom’s impressive 44% revenue surge last year, projections indicate a decelerating growth trajectory—21% this year followed by 15% next year. So ask yourself the question: if you want to hold on to your AVGO stock, will you panic and sell if it starts dropping to $150, $100, or even lower levels?
Holding on a falling stock is not always easy. Trefis works with Empirical Asset – a Boston area wealth manager, whose asset allocation strategies yielded positive returns during 2008/2009 timeframe, when S&P lost more than 40%.
Empirical has incorporated the Trefis HQ Portfolio in this asset allocation framework to provide clients better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

	Today, Elon Musk‘s X feed offered the usual mix of paranoid politics, attacks on Democrats and government agencies, and content from accounts affiliated with President Donald Trump (who still prefers his own web platform, Truth Social). But mixed in were a number of posts about Tesla, the electric vehicle manufacturer that still counts him as CEO despite his seemingly full-time commitment to the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a task force firing thousands of government workers as it torches the administrative state.

	Musk posted, for example, a TikTok of a man showing off the design and features of a Tesla Model Y. Before that, he amplified pro-Tesla comments from anti-LGBTQ+ activist Robby Starbuck and MAGA conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer. Over the weekend, he shared clip from a Tesla fan account of the prototype for the Cybercab, a two-seater robotaxi the company will allegedly be making by 2026. He also circulated a video taken by a customer in their new Cybertruck, writing, “Heartfelt thanks to everyone supporting @Tesla, despite many attacks against our stores and offices.” The comment referred to a scattered handful of fires at Tesla dealerships in recent days — some of them alleged or suspected arsons — as well as showrooms vandalized or damaged by gunfire.

	










	Musk’s increased advertising might be thanks to Tesla’s wobbly performance on Wall Street. The stock finally dropped into free fall today, plunging more than 15 percent to mark one of the company’s worst trading days since it went public in 2010. The tumble erased the last vestiges of the rally Tesla enjoyed after Trump’s election victory in November, when investors clearly felt that a company run by the president-elect’s largest Super PAC donor was a smart bet. It has lost more than 50 percent of its value — the equivalent of some $800 billion — since cresting in mid-December.

	A number of factors contributed to this reversal, including declines across the market and hints of a possible recession. Yet the Tesla brand has also become uniquely toxic since Musk swept into Washington, gave what was widely recognized as a Nazi salute at an inauguration event, and moved to eliminate entire federal offices at a stroke, all while continuing to spew far-right misinformation on X. Last month, the mounting backlash cohered into a formal protest campaign, Tesla Takedown, that is organizing regular demonstrations at Tesla centers around the world while encouraging a boycott and, of course, calling for the automaker’s investors to sell their shares.

	Unsurprisingly, Musk has disparaged Tesla Takedown as something astroturfed by wealthy liberals (and conflated the peaceful movement with attacks in which suspected arsonists threw Molotov cocktails at dealerships). On Saturday, he claimed without evidence on X that an “investigation” of some kind had revealed that wealthy philanthropists including George Soros, Reid Hoffman, and Leah Hunt-Hendrix were funding the groups behind Tesla protests through the Democratic fundraising platform ActBlue. Aside from misrepresenting how ActBlue works — it doesn’t fund anything but is rather a system through which donors can send money to Democratic political candidates and liberal organizations — Musk also pointed the finger at two more supposed financiers of Tesla Takedown, Herbert Sandler and Patricia Bauman, who died in 2019 and 2024, respectively.

	Hoffman pushed back against the unfounded accusation today on X. “Just one more of Elon’s false claims about me: I never funded anyone for Tesla protests,” wrote the billionaire co-founder of LinkedIn, who was an executive with Musk at PayPal in the early 2000s. “I don’t condone violence. But it’s clear Americans are angry at him — it’s easier to explain away their anger, than to accept that actions have consequences.” Musk replied, “Describe your favorite island vacation,” baselessly implying that Hoffman had visited the Caribbean private island of the late sex trafficker and pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. While Hoffman was acquainted with Epstein, as many rich and powerful individuals were, there is nothing to suggest he was a client of Epstein’s trafficking ring. He revealed in an interview last year that he had to hire security staff because of Musk’s repeated insinuations to the contrary. (Hunt-Hendrix did not return a request for comment on Musk’s ActBlue accusation, while Soros, a frequent target for Musk and far-right instigators, did not comment publicly on it.)

	Elsewhere, Musk amplified a post from a Tesla-promoting account outlining the historical links that other automakers, including Mercedes and Volkswagen, have to the Nazi regime. Responding to a post about how actress Alyssa Milano had traded in her Tesla for an electric vehicle from VW, Musk wrote, “Alyssa Milano loves Hitler.” He also replied to a self-identified nationalist user’s groundless claim that “groups” attacking Tesla property are “inspired by” Luigi Mangione, the alleged murderer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. “Wow,” he wrote.

	As Tesla shares took a pounding today, X also faced with a series of outages that Musk chalked up to a “massive cyberattack,” though he did not go into further detail. When the site was functioning, Musk made sure to spread a wild conspiracy theory about a fire at a Tesla lot in Seattle late Sunday night that damaged several Cybertrucks. “TERROR: Multiple Democrat [non-governmental organizations] have coordinated attacks on Tesla dealerships, staff, and vehicles,” claimed the anonymous author of a right-wing account, without evidence. “Last night a number of Cybertrucks were torched in Seattle. Democrats are becoming increasingly more desperate and violent.” In fact, the fire is currently under investigation, and the names and political affiliations of any suspected arsonists have not been made public at this time. Nevertheless, Musk shared the blatantly false narrative that Democratic NGOs were to blame, adding: “This is crazy.”

	










	Where it came to positive content about Tesla, it appears that no X account is too obscure for Musk to boost. “All the protests and stories of vandalism to @Tesla service centers and harassment of Tesla owners is insane!” wrote a blue-check user with fewer than 5,000 followers on Sunday. “Let’s all stand together and push back against the aggression!” An accompanying image showed the Tesla logo and the slogan “Stand With Tesla.” Musk reposted it to his massive audience, but the sentiment didn’t prevent him from losing $23 billion the following day.

36,2025-03-10,"Eli Lilly (LLY+2.04%) CEO David Ricks got a 10% raise in 2024, as a surge in demand for weigh-loss drugs has propelled the pharma giant into the most valuable pharmaceutical company in the world.
Ricks’ total compensation for 2024 reached $29.2 million, according to the company’s latest proxy statement, up from $26.6 million in 2023. When he became CEO in 2017, Ricks’ annual compensation started at $15.8 million.
In that time, Eli Lilly has seen explosive growth, largely due to its blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound.
Both drugs belong to GLP-1 class of treatments, made famous by rival Novo Nordisk’s (NVO-2.46%) Ozempic. GLP-1s, or incretin medications, mimic gut hormones that regulate blood sugar and curb appetite. Morgan Stanley (MS+1.94%) analysts anticipate the global market for these drugs will reach $105 billion by 2030.
Mounjaro brought in $11.5 billion in sales in 2024, while Zepbound generated $4.9 billion in annual revenue.
Overall, Eli Lilly’s total sales for the year across all its drugs amounted to $45 billion. The company projects that sales in 2025 will reach between $58 billion and $61 billion.
The company’s strong performance has also boosted its stock price. Eli Lilly’s stock has climbed 10% over the past 12 months to about $842 a share. Over the last five years, the company’s stock has surged nearly 500%
With a market cap of $754 billion, Eli Lilly is now the most valuable healthcare company in the world, ranking 12th overall. For comparison, the next closest healthcare companies are UnitedHealth Group (UNH+0.11%) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ-0.75%), with market caps of $448 billion and $406 billion, respectively.

I have been a skeptic of some of the more breathless claims made for Generative AI since at least October 2023, when I participated in a panel organized by Syracuse University.  Specifically, I have been skeptical of claims that these technologies will dramatically increase labor productivity in most or all occupations. This is generally what is meant by those who see Generative AI as a 'first step' toward 'artificial general intelligence' and is implicit in claims that AI needs to be regulated to avoid mass labor market disruption.
I believe we are very close to the peak of investor hype around Generative AI. At time of writing, NVIDIA's stock price is down around 20% for the year to date.
If I could time further falls, I'd be trading on that knowledge instead of writing about it here. That said, I would be surprised if executives are giving ""AI strategy"" high priority in Q2 of 2026. A new narrative will be required to drive investment in tech.
The Gartner Hype Cycle is a perennially relevant framework for understanding these narrative shifts. If we are entering the ""trough of disillusionment"", now would be a good time to ask what the ""plateau of productivity"" might look like.
LLMs have made possible real process innovations. Software development and customer support services, for example, can be delivered somewhat more efficiently than they were before. Retrieval through LLM document embeddings, though no panacea, represents a genuine advance in search.
In customer support, the early and often routine steps of a call tree can now be handled by chatbots in many instances, with only exceptional cases escalated to human agents. The chatbot is helping some fraction of customers help themselves by walking them through support documentation step by step. Some fraction of end users will find this frustrating, but if they aren't particularly wealthy, the new equilibrium could very well be a degraded customer experience. Those with the means will be able to purchase support services that let them skip the bots and get directly to human assistance.
In my occupation of software development, querying ChatGPT and DeepSeek has largely replaced searching sites like StackOverflow. These chatbots generally save time with prompts like ""write a TypeScript type declaration for objects that look like this"", ""convert this function from Python to Javascript"", ""provide me with a list of the scientific names of bird species mentioned directly or indirectly in this essay"".
Anecdotally, LLMs seem to be substituting for less experienced developers across the industry as a whole. While the job market for more experienced developers (5+ years) has slackened modestly compared to late-2019 due to higher interest rates, the job market for less experienced developers seems positively dire.
We may look back in a decade and lament how self-serving and short-sighted employers stopped hiring less experienced workers, denied them the opportunity to learn by doing, and thereby limited the future supply of experience developers. I imagine the headaches for computer science educators are incredible, as LLMs have been trained on every problem set ever posted online.
The release of DeepSeek just a few weeks ago threw into question how many GPUs would really be needed, in aggregate, to generate all the tokens for which there was effective demand.
Those trying to rescue the investor narrative are appealing to Jevons' Paradox. Jevons observed that rising efficiency in the use of coal coincided with rising coal consumption; AI boosters argue that increasing LLM efficiency can just as well occur alongside rising LLM usage. Brynjolfsson has highlighted  software development as an occupation that may see increased demand for workers alongside rising (LLM-driven) labor productivity. But it seems to me that for customer support, for example, demand for low to medium quality chatbot support is fairly inelastic. One hopes the same is true for the ""AI Slop"" currently inundating social media feeds.
The Dead Internet Theory holds that there are virtually no real human beings posting on social media anymore, having all been replaced by bots. This is a wild overstatement. But political influence and scam bots (handling the early intake phase of the scam) may turn out to be the sustainable killer application for this technology."
40,2025-03-10,"Uncertainty from text analysis, and from consumer surveys:
First economic policy uncertainty:

Figure 1: EPU (blue), and 7 day centered moving average (red). Source: policyuncertainty.com and author’s calculations.
Next, consider the newly released NY Fed measures of 1 year ahead expected inflation, and uncertainty.

Figure 2: Median one year ahead inflation (blue), and associated uncertainty (brown). Source: NY Fed.
Third, even more interesting is how the “better off” a year ahead number  (sum of much better off and somewhat better off) has evolved, vs. U.Michigan economic sentiment and Conference  Board confidence.

Figure 3: U. .Michigan survey median future expectations (blue, left scale), and NY Fed survey “better off in a year” (brown, right scale), both demeaned and divided by standard deviation 2013-2025. Source: U.Mich. via FRED, NY Fed, and author’s calculations.
 
Exactly so. The world does work more or less as it should, most of the time.
My concern is that financial stresses show up “Gradually, then suddenly”. The EPU index measures talk, not risk premia. Most convention financial stress indices (KC and St. Louis Fed, OFR) which run off of prices, are low, though some are headed up. By the time risk premia begin to generally show an increase, it is likely to be “suddenly”.
Sad news today.  Kevin Drum has died after a decade long battle with myeloma.
Kevin was one of the smartest and most skilled civilian translators of complicated economic data for the general public.  He will be missed.
I never found anyone like him on the internet.  I learned more about more varied stuff from him than anyone else, by far.
May he Rest in Peace.
Sorry to lose him.
Another sad passing:
https://www.bulwer-lytton.com/
R.I.P. Bulwer-Lytton Contest. You will be missed.
I didn’t  know about Drum when I wrote about Bulwer-Lytton. No disrespect intended.
No problem.  I assumed as much.
Kevin kept blogging right up to the end.  One of his last postings:
“Fading fast. Pneumonia worse. Ventilator next. Not looking good. Take care of Donald Trump for me.”
I guess now we will have to take care of Trump for him.
Rick stryker, is the trump recession part of the plan?  Or is it simply an added bonus in his attempts to destroy America?  Just for the record, rick is a strong proponent of trump and his current actions and outcomes. He will defend trump unapologetically.
Elon Musk today: “10% of federal expenditures” are due to people having fake Social Security numbers, claiming it is “half a trillion dollars.”
How is it that people say Musk is smart?  This doesn’t even make sense.
He keeps making up claims of massive fraud but so far hasn’t documented a single case.
He’s learning from his boss. Also, federal government quasi-emoyees are not supervised by the SEC; Musk is basking in the glow.
They have yet to show a single case of a >125 year old person getting a check.  Trump was bawling off large numbers of extremely old people listed in the social security databases – but never stated that those people have been receiving any money lately.  These computer “geniuses” went in and found records of everybody that had ever been listed in social security since its beginning.
Data from the NY Fed’s survey of consumer expectations for February were released today:
https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/sce#/
 As usual, there are some oddities.
Income and spending expectations were modestly better than in January, on par with all of Q4. At the same time, debt delinquency expectations are the highest since 2020, expectation for higher unemployment jumped up and expectations for household finances deteriorated. So, earn and spend more, but worse employment and finances. Notably, the biggest rise in expectations for spending and income was among the least numerate respondents. 
There’s a particular oddity regarding expectations for the increase in government debt. Just about every category of respondent, by region, income and education, expects a slower pace of government debt growth than in January, and the average expectation fell to the lowest rate since mid-2017. (Where in the heck are these people getting their news?) The only group to anticipate higher debt in February than in recent months is those below the age of 40. The largest drop in expectations for debt increase was among less numerate respondents. 
Expectations of higher unemployment in February were led by those under-40, the college educated, those earning above $100,000 and Westerners. 
Inflation expectations edged up slightly, with the same groups who most anticipate higher unemployment also most expecting higher inflation. Apparently,  the stagflation story is getting traction in some quarters.
My two cents: The groups which most expect worse spending, income, employment and inflation outcomes also tend to vote Democratic and to be employed as journalists. The NY Fed doesn’t segregate by party affiliation, but we may be seeing another example of partisan bias in consumer expectations. Frankly, I’d put my money on the views of the well-educated, more numerate respondents, though how those jejune under-40s got so clever I can’t imagine.
I think they are hearing that government is laying off people and presume that will reduce government spending and debt.  Sometimes the level of ignorance can be shocking for those of us who follow the news.  
Salary cost for the 2 million federal employees are a minimal fraction of the total federal spending – so the “cutting” cost by firing people is just a cruel theater.
What’s curious about this picture?:
https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1EmEp
The VIX is moderately elevated, while corporate spreads are not. I admit to a bias in favor of fixed income metrics over equity metrics. With that on the table, let’s continue.  Since the Covid oopsie, there has been a shift from higher spreads and lower VIX to lower spreads and higher VIX. For some reason, stock volatility has become more elevated, while other corporate risk metrics have not.
Even so, moderately elevated VIX vs dead low corporate spreads is hard to explain. 
Unledd maybe corporate cash is the explanation?:
https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1EmFP
I’m not smart enough to know if the high level of corporate cash holdings explains the divergence between the VIX and corporate spreads, but I would point out that cash holdings are no longer rising. 
Obviously, I’m looking for triggers for a sudden increase in financial ickiness. That has been my professional bread and butter, and I can’t help myself. Corporate cash is a buffer against a sudden market puke. Corporate cash seems to explain the divergence between equity and debt performance right now. 
What’s missing from this analysis? Small business is. Small business formation has been a major factor in economic performance in the Covid era:
https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1EmH6
A look at recent FOMC minutes or small business surveys shows that small businesses are suffering from a lack of access to credit. We know that households are facing difficulties in meeting financial requirements, and households have been a major source of funding for small business in the Covid era. If households cut back on spending and small business formation stalls, I doubt all that corporate cash will save us.
“President Donald Trump shared his intent to purchase a Tesla on Tuesday to support Elon Musk”
[He’d better act soon because the price of steel and aluminum is going up fast..]
Trump is buying a Pity Tesla.
Residents of which state have bought more Teslas  than residents of any other state?  California, of course, 3X more than residents of Texas and Florida combined.
Residents of which state are more pissed off at Trump, Musk, and congressional Republicans who regularly threaten to withhold  future disaster aid unless more water is sent to Bakersfield?  California, of course.
Unless MAGAites suddenly  fall in love with electric vehicles, where might Tesla sales tank severely?  Anyone? Anyone? Bueller?  Musk? Donald?
Uncertainty… perhaps. Or just basic pricing. From a month ago.
https://www.axios.com/2025/02/18/stocks-overvalued-research
Odd that you have commented here, when Menzie has already published a new post about the economic consequences of policy uncertainty, a post which makes obvious how policy uncertainty could lead to stock market decline.
Stocks have been overvalued for some time. So tell us, why would investors change their minds now? As demonstrated in the featured study, uncertainty has real economic consequences. Uncertainty is elevated, suggesting rising economic risks, and stocks have fallen just as one would expect. 
The Vix is absolutely correlated with stock performance – negatively correlated. The Vix is colloquially known as “the fear index”. What is the most likely cause of fear among stock investors now which wasn’t present 2 months ago?
And let’s not ignore the point of the study; uncertainty is associated with bad economic outcomes. Menzie has drawn a perfectly reasonable connection to stocks – which you seem to want to dismiss – but the risk to the economy isn’t a matter of over-priced stocks. Inconvenient for your point, but let’s not dodge the issue.
So why, exactly, do you think uncertainty might not be to blame for the sharp drop in equity values? You think $4 trillion in value evaporated now, rather than 2 months ago, just at random? Or is this another of your efforts to defend the felon-in-chief?

LONDON, ENGLAND - MARCH 28: The Enphase domestic home EV electric Vehicle charger company logo ... [+] branding is displayed during the Everything Electric London 2024 at ExCel on March 28, 2024 in London, England. (Photo by John Keeble/Getty Images)
Enphase Energy (NASDAQ: ENPH) is a top provider of residential solar energy solutions. It uses microinverter technology for efficient energy conversion and delivers integrated solutions for solar power, storage, and EV charging. Enphase’s advanced technology allows it to command a premium for its microinverters compared to traditional string inverters. Nonetheless, the company has been navigating a challenging rooftop solar market since interest rates increased in 2022.
 
What’s More to Consider? With a market capitalization of $8 billion, Enphase has lost 15% of its value year-to-date. Investors should recognize the company’s sensitivity to economic downturns, as seen during the 2020 Covid crisis when its stock dropped by approximately 60% in a few quarters. This history raises concerns that Enphase’s current share price of around $60 could potentially fall below $40 if similar conditions recur. However, for investors who seek lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative, having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception.
Enphase’s proprietary technology and dominant market position make it appealing, yet broad economic uncertainties in the U.S. present a significant risk for investors. What risk might that be?
Clean energy stocks are experiencing uncertainty due to the possible repeal of Inflation Reduction Act incentives and inflation concerns stemming from Trump’s tariff and tax cut policies, which add to the challenges posed by high interest rates. As explained in our macroeconomic analysis, these factors could potentially drive the U.S. economy into turbulence or even a recession.
Economic challenges are further intensified by escalating geopolitical tensions, driven by the Trump administration’s assertive foreign policy. Ongoing conflicts, such as the Ukraine-Russia situation, and increasingly uncertain trade relationships—including renegotiations with traditional allies like Canada and Mexico—create a complex and risky environment for investors.
While investors hope for a soft landing in the U.S. economy, how severe could the impact be if another recession occurs? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash illustrates how key stocks performed during and after the last six market crashes.
• ENPH stock dropped 20.4% from a high of $336.00 on 28 November 2022 to $267.38 on 28 December 2022, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500
  • The stock has yet to return to its pre-Crisis high
  • The stock has continued to decline since the end of 2022 and is currently trading at around $60
• ENPH stock declined 59.4% from a high of $59.09 on 23 February 2020 to $23.99 on 18 March 2020, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500
  • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 11 May 2020
In summary, it does not help that Enphase’s stock remains expensive; it trades at nearly 6 times last year’s sales and close to 77 times last year’s earnings. The company’s financial performance was notably poor last year, with revenues dropping by 42% and earnings per share declining by 76% year-over-year.
Given this slowdown in growth and broader economic uncertainties, ask yourself this question: do you want to hold onto your Enphase stock now, or will you panic and sell if it starts falling to $40, $30, or even lower levels? Holding onto a declining stock is never easy. Trefis collaborates with Empirical Asset Management—a Boston-area wealth manager—whose asset allocation strategies delivered positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P dropped by over 40%. Empirical has integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio within this asset allocation framework to offer clients better returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; it provides a smoother ride, as evidenced by the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

43,2025-03-10,"The US stock market skidded last week over concerns about a potential recession — and it's making some investors consider China again.
The change in tune comes on the back of a bull run in China's stock markets. The MSCI China Index is up 20% so far this year, marking the best start of the year in history for Chinese stocks. The strong gains come after several years of dismal performance.
Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a Sunday note that global mutual funds — who are typically long-only investors — may ""rekindle their interest in and sponsorship for Chinese equities."" Over the last three years, these investors largely sat out rallies and reduced their exposures.
""Our latest investor conversations suggest that global LO mandates have become more engaged in Chinese capital market transactions (IPOs and placements) of late, and are increasingly motivated to add to the public market given the recent weakness and volatility in the US stock market where their allocations are close to all-time highs,"" wrote Goldman Sachs' analysts.
They wrote that investors are also considering Chinese stocks because of China's technological breakthroughs and reduced regulatory uncertainty.
The analysts estimate markets could see $8 billion worth of net buying in Chinese equities if global mutual funds up their allocation to the asset class by just 1 percentage point.
The MSCI China Index's gains have outperformed developed and emerging markets by well over 10%.
Goldman Sachs is maintaining its overweight calls on China H-shares and A-shares — those listed in Hong Kong and on the mainland, respectively. However, the analysts wrote that they expect China's bull run to slow and profit-taking pressures to emerge as US-China geopolitical tensions continue.
Goldman Sachs also repeated its stance that China's current market rally is different from a short-lived September surge in Chinese stocks that was driven by an aggressive stimulus blitz from Beijing. September's policy pivot reduced downside risks for stocks, but recent developments in China's tech space are a game-changer, the analysts wrote.
The boost in Chinese tech stocks is thanks to the recent rise of DeepSeek, a Chinese startup that released a cost-competitive AI model.
This development flipped the narrative for Chinese Big Tech stocks that were previously under pressure from a state-led crackdown. It suggests that Chinese tech may present serious challenges to capital-intensive AI development that has long been dominated by Western firms.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng Tech Index has surged about 32% so far this year. Stocks of tech giants Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu have jumped 66%, 27%, and 12%, respectively.
""The latest technology breakthroughs are more micro- and innovation-driven in nature, and are beneficial to earnings as well as to valuations, which might give the recovery more staying power than those that were purely driven by liquidity and policy expectation repricing,"" the Goldman Sachs analysts wrote.

POLAND - 2025/01/22: In this photo illustration, the AMD logo seen displayed on a smartphone. (Photo ... [+] Illustration by Mateusz Slodkowski/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)
 
Question: How would you feel if you owned AMD stock and it fell by 60%, or even 80%, over the next few months? It sounds extreme, but it has happened before—and it could happen again. This year, AMD has struggled, falling about 18% since January, whereas the S&P 500 has stayed almost flat. The stock has been hindered by weaker-than-expected growth in its AI accelerator business, the launch of China’s new resource-light DeepSeek AI model—which might reduce GPU demand—and mounting macroeconomic concerns in the U.S. following President Donald Trump’s tariff impositions. We believe that the stock could decline further to as low as $40 per share. Here is why investors should be concerned.
The key point is that in an economic downturn, AMD stock could suffer significant losses. Evidence from as recently as 2022 shows that AMD stock lost over 60% of its value in just a few quarters. Could AMD’s roughly $100 stock drop to about $40 if a repeat of 2022 occurs? Of course, individual stocks tend to be more volatile than a diversified portfolio. In such an environment, if you are seeking upside with less volatility than holding a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and delivered returns of over 91% since its inception.
Although the generative AI wave has led to a surge in GPU demand, AMD’s AI accelerator business has not performed as well as anticipated. In Q4, AMD’s data center revenue—a proxy for its AI chip sales—reached $3.9 billion, falling short of consensus estimates. Furthermore, guidance appears weak, as the company indicated that data center sales for the current quarter are expected to decline by 7% sequentially. There are also concerns about the broader AI market, as companies may become more cost-conscious after years of excessive investment in AI infrastructure. The introduction of the DeepSeek AI model reduces the computing capacity required by generative AI models. Since DeepSeek’s model is open source, many large tech companies might adopt its methods to reduce costs. If widely adopted, this could temper the demand for AI computing power, potentially affecting GPU demand.
President Donald Trump’s trade war could also adversely affect companies like AMD. The Trump administration doubled the tariff on Chinese goods from 10% to 20% on top of existing levies. Last month, President Trump also hinted at the possibility of imposing a tariff of 25% or more on all semiconductor chips imported into the United States. Currently, AMD outsources most of its chip fabrication to Taiwan’s TSMC, and import tariffs could increase the cost of its products. AMD maintained gross margins of about 49% over the past year, indicating that the cost of its products—most of which are likely imported—exceeds 50%. In contrast, rival Nvidia reported an adjusted gross margin of approximately 75.5%, suggesting that the cost of its imported products is likely below 25% of its revenues. This implies that tariffs could more significantly impact AMD, forcing the company either to absorb the extra costs—thereby reducing margins—or pass them on to customers, risking a decline in volume.
Trump’s bold actions on tariffs and immigration have also sparked concerns about a potential resurgence of inflation. All of these factors suggest that the U.S. economy could face significant challenges, and potentially even a recession—our analysis here on the macro picture. Considering the heightened geopolitical uncertainty resulting from the new Trump administration's bold actions, these risks are critical. After all, the Ukraine-Russia war continues, and trade remains uncertain. Tariffs increase import costs, typically leading to higher prices, reduced disposable income, and lower consumer spending. This scenario could negatively affect AMD’s core CPU business, as PC and laptop customers might postpone purchases, thereby diminishing chip demand.
During some recent downturns, AMD stock has underperformed compared to the benchmark S&P 500 index. Are you concerned about the impact of a market crash on AMD stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Advanced Micro Devices Stock Go In A Market Crash? offers a detailed analysis of the stock's performance during and after previous market crashes.
• AMD stock declined by 62.8% from a high of $150.24 on 3 January 2022 to $55.94 on 16 October 2022, compared to a 25.4% peak-to-trough decline for the S&P 500
  • The stock fully recovered to its pre-crisis peak by 16 January 2024
  • Since then, the stock rose to a high of $211.38 on 7 March 2024 and currently trades at approximately $100
• AMD stock declined by 34.3% from a high of $58.90 on 19 February 2020 to $38.71 on 16 March 2020, compared to a 33.9% peak-to-trough decline for the S&P 500
  • The stock fully recovered to its pre-crisis peak by 22 July 2020
• AMD stock declined by 87.6% from a high of $14.55 on 18 October 2007 to $1.80 on 25 November 2008, compared to a 56.8% peak-to-trough decline for the S&P 500
  • The stock fully recovered to its pre-crisis peak by 27 February 2017
But given its extremely high valuation, the stock appears relatively expensive, which supports our conclusion that AMD is an expensive stock to buy.
In summary, it does not help that AMD stock remains expensive, trading at nearly 30 times trailing earnings. Certainly, Advanced Micro Devices’ Revenues have grown significantly in recent years, increasing at an average rate of 17.8% over the past 3 years (compared to 9.8% for the S&P 500). However, this growth could quickly diminish if the economy deteriorates and tariffs are imposed on AMD’s products.
Given the slowdown in growth and broader economic uncertainties, ask yourself the question: do you want to hold on to your AMD stock now, or will you panic and sell if it falls to $50, $40, or even lower levels? Holding on to a declining stock is never easy. Trefis collaborates with Empirical Asset Management—a Boston-area wealth manager—whose asset allocation strategies yielded positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P lost over 40%. Empirical has integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio in this asset allocation framework to provide clients better returns with less riskcompared to the benchmark index—resulting in a less volatile experience, as evidenced by the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

45,2025-03-10,US stocks looked set to build on losses of over 2% for the major indexes as March's struggles looked to continue.
46,2025-03-10,"

	Stock markets continued their downward slide today amid growing concerns that President Donald Trump’s economic shock doctrine will trigger a major economic downturn. The “golden age” of economic prosperity he promised during his 2024 campaign doesn’t seem to be coming anytime soon, and just weeks into his term, Trump is scrambling to make excuses for an increasingly grim economic forecast. 

	During his first term in office, and throughout his reelection campaign, the president regularly claimed that upward trends in major stock markets were a reflection of his economic and political genius. Downward slides were inevitably his opponents’ fault. On Friday, however, he blamed shady “globalists” for cratering markets. On Sunday, during a discussion of the potential fallout of his trade war against Canada, Mexico, and China, the president told Fox News that, in fact, Americans shouldn’t “really watch the stock market.” 

	“If you look at China, they have a 100-year perspective,” Trump added. “We go by quarters. And you can’t go by that.”

	










	When asked directly by host Maria Bartiromo if he was bracing for a recessionary economy, Trump claimed that while he “hates to predict things like that … there is a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big. We’re bringing wealth back to America.”

	When asked a similar question on Air Force One later that afternoon, Trump reverted to the scammy get-rich-quick promises of his campaign. “All I know is this, we’re going to take in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs, and we’re going to become so rich you’re not going to know when to spend all that money,” he told reporters.

	When asked what he had to say to Americans who were seeing their retirement investments fall in the past few weeks, the president replied that “the tariffs are going to be the greatest thing we’ve done as a country.” 

	“It’s going to make our country rich again,” he added. 

	But before those piles of cash materialize, Trump and his closest economic advisers are conceding that Americans will suffer.

	Earlier this month, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick acknowledged that “there is going to be a short period of time where there will be some higher prices on certain products,” but claimed that it “is not inflation, that’s nonsense.” Last week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defended the tariffs by telling the Economic Club of New York that “access to cheap goods is not the essence of the American dream.” Bessent previously used the same term Trump did — warning of a “transition” period — to discuss the possibility of a recession economy. Trump, meanwhile, has on multiple occasions, including during his address to Congress last week, said Americans will experience an economic “disturbance” or “disruption” as a result of his tariff plan.

	










	Economists have warned that Trump’s trade war and tariff obsession will likely lead to sharp increases in costs for consumers, supply chain disruptions, and slowed GDP growth. Even Republican lawmakers — already struggling with constituent backlash over the slash-and-burn tactics of Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government efficiency — are growing antsy.

	“The Canadian tariffs will definitely have a detrimental impact on the economy of Maine and on border communities in particular,” Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) told The Hill today. “I think it freezes investment until they know exactly what the impact is going to be. So I understand the president’s desire to level the playing field, but Canada’s just not the problem in Maine.”

	One anonymous Republican senator told The Hill that maybe if Trump’s “approvals keep diving and the economy starts to pinch,” the president would roll back his increasingly damaging agenda. In the meantime, the chaos isn’t helping anyone. And while the president would like to promise Americans so much money they’ll have no idea what to spend it on, it’s a sales pitch from a man whose companies have filed for bankruptcy six times.

ABBV Stock
 
AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) stock has demonstrated remarkable resilience in 2025, posting a 22% gain while the S&P 500 has declined 2%. As ongoing trade tensions fuel concerns about economic stability, investors are increasingly gravitating toward defensive sectors, particularly pharmaceuticals, with the S&P Healthcare index climbing 8% year-to-date.
The market’s confidence in AbbVie stems primarily from exceptional growth in its immunology portfolio, specifically Skyrizi and Rinvoq. The company’s impressive Q4 performance has further bolstered investor sentiment. Additionally, AbbVie has now positioned itself in the high-growth obesity treatment market through a recently announced licensing partnership with Gubra.
After its recent rise, ABBV stock looks relatively expensive - making it an expensive pick to buy at its current price of around $215. We believe there are some minor concerns with ABBV stock, which makes it relatively expensive given that its current valuation looks very high. 
  We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of ABBV stock with its operating performance over the recent years, as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of AbbVie along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. However, for investors who seek lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative, having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see How ADBE Stock Might React To Upcoming Earnings?
Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, ABBV stock looks expensive compared to the broader market.
• AbbVie has a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.6 vs. a figure of 3.2 for the S&P 500
  • Additionally, the company's price-to-operating income (P/EBIT) ratio is 31.1 compared to 24.3 for S&P 500
  • And, it has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 19.7 vs. the benchmark's 24.3
AbbVie's Revenues have grown marginally over recent years.
• AbbVie has seen its top line grow at an average rate of 0.2% over the last 3 years (vs. increase of 6.9% for S&P 500)
  • Its revenues have grown 3.7% from $54 Bil to $56 Bil in the last 12 months (vs. growth of 5.2% for S&P 500)
  • Also, its quarterly revenues grew 5.6% to $15 Bil in the most recent quarter from $14 Bil a year ago (vs. 5.0% improvement for S&P 500)
AbbVie's profit margins are much higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe.
• AbbVie's Operating Income over the last four quarters was $12 Bil, which represents a high Operating Margin of 21.1% (vs. 13.0% for S&P 500)
  • AbbVie’s Operating Cash Flow (OCF) over this period was $19 Bil, pointing to a high OCF-to-Sales Ratio of 33.4% (vs. 15.7% for S&P 500)
AbbVie's balance sheet looks fine.
• AbbVie's Debt figure was $67 Bil at the end of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $379 Bil (as of 3/7/2025). This implies a strong Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 18.2% (vs. 19.0% for S&P 500). [Note: A lower Debt-to-Equity Ratio is desirable]
  • Cash (including cash equivalents) makes up $5.6 Bil of the $135 Bil in Total Assets for AbbVie. This yields a poor Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 4.1% (vs. 14.8% for S&P 500)
ABBV stock has seen an impact that was slightly better than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes.
• ABBV stock fell 23.3% from a high of $174.96 on 10 April 2022 to $134.21 on 2 October 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500
  • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 7 February 2024
  • Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $214.29 on 9 March 2025

• ABBV stock fell 32.1% from a high of $94.96 on 23 February 2020 to $64.50 on 23 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500
  • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 9 June 2020

In summary, AbbVie's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows:
• Growth: Neutral
  • Profitability: Very Strong
  • Financial Stability: Neutral
  • Downturn Resilience: Neutral
  • Overall: Neutral
But given its very high valuation, the stock appears relatively expensive, which supports our conclusion that ABBV is an expensive stock to buy.
The rich valuation of ABBV stock limits its upside potential in the near-to-mid term. As an alternative, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

49,2025-03-10,"The leader of Ontario, Canada, made good on his threats to slap a 25% tariff on electricity sent to neighboring U.S. states on Monday. The tariffs are a direct response to President Donald Trump’s tariffs against Canada, a form of economic coercion with the goal of making Canada a state or territory of the United States.
The announcement of the 25% tariff on electricity to the U.S. was made by Ontario’s premier, Doug Ford, and energy minister, Stephen Lecce, at a press conference Monday. The electricity being imported to the U.S. primarily goes to three states: New York, Michigan, and Minnesota, though customers in other neighboring states like Wisconsin will also feel the impact. At least 1.5 million Americans will see the price hike, according to Canada’s CBC.
The new tariff will add about $10 per megawatt-hour to electricity heading from Canada to the U.S., generating about $300,000 to $400,000 per day in extra revenue, according to the CBC. That money will be used to support businesses negatively affected by American tariffs imposed by Trump.
President Trump has flip-flopped on tariffs against not just Canada but also other countries like Mexico in recent weeks. Last week, Trump “paused” a portion of the 25% tariffs he had announced for Canada, setting a new deadline of April 2, but Canada said it would not pause its own retaliatory tariffs until Trump dropped them entirely.
“Until these tariffs are off the table, until the threat of tariffs is gone for good, Ontario will not relent,” Ford said Monday. “We will not back down, pausing some tariffs, making last minute exemptions, it won’t cut it. We need to end the chaos once and for all. We need to sit down, work together, and land a fair deal.”
Initially, Trump said the tariffs were needed because Canada allowed fentanyl to be trafficked into the U.S., an absurd pretext for Trump’s goal of harming Canada economically in order to annex the nation. Less than 1% of fentanyl coming into the U.S. comes from Canada. But the flimsy pretext was needed to create a national security justification for the tariffs, the only way to violate the United StatesâMexicoâCanada Agreement (USMCA) with some thin veneer of legality.
Trump himself negotiated the USMCA, which was just a replacement for the free trade agreement known as NAFTA, first agreed to in the 1990s by President Bill Clinton. But Trump has said the USMCA allows Canada and Mexico to “take advantage” of the U.S., an absurd argument that simply makes no sense.
The press conference Monday by Ford and his energy minister Lecce addressed the possible repercussions for the Canadian economy. Lecce said they don’t need to worry about retaliation from the U.S. because Ontario has agreements with the province of Quebec that allow them to ramp up capacity during the hot days of summer without relying too much on U.S. electricity imports.
Ford noted that even if Trump somehow was successful in getting businesses to relocate from Canada to the U.S., America simply doesn’t have enough workers to fill the positions. The premier said he’d sat down with car manufacturers in particular who said that even if they wanted to move everything they had from Canada to the U.S., they couldn’t do it for lack of available employees.
Ford is a conservative who previously appeared to be an ally of Trump, which has turned him into an unlikely adversary of the American president’s policies. But Canadians have been understandably upset with Trump’s threats against their country, leading to a slew of actions that appear to befuddle some Americans. Canadians have been booing the U.S. national anthem at sporting events, and a nationwide boycott of American products has led to viral videos showing products like Lay’s potato chips sitting unsold in grocery stores in the country, despite being heavily discounted.
American booze has also been taken off the shelves in some provinces, something American alcohol producers have protested. Even if tariffs raise prices, those producers can still make money, though less, thanks to the tariffs. If the product isn’t even available to purchase, they make no money.
Ford noted that he has been talking with Republicans in the U.S. who really don’t like how Trump is harming American business right now.
“I talked to a tremendous amount of Americans,” Ford said at the press conference. “They totally disagree with what President Trump is doing. Stanch Republican Trump supporters totally disagreeing with President Trump on this policy. So I think we have a strong relationship. It goes back over 200 years.”
Ford also mentioned that Trump is hurting the stock market, which has plunged in recent weeks over the uncertainty and chaos introduced by the president. Asked by a reporter Monday what he would say to President Trump, Ford implored him to look at what’s happening to the stock market.
“I would say, you know, one of his measuring sticks are the markets,” Ford said. “The markets have dropped trillions of dollars. He has to understand. He’s a smart guy. He may like them or dislike them, but make no mistake. He understands the markets.”
Ford may be trying to stroke Trump’s ego, but there’s no real evidence the president is a smart guy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 480 points for the day at the time of this writing. And there are indications that Trump and his goons may be trying to intentionally harm the U.S. economy to suppress wages and buy up assets for cheap in an economic downturn. Trump was asked by Fox Business over the weekend if he could rule out a recession, and he made no promises, calling this a “transition” period.
BARTIROMO: Are you expecting a recession this year?
TRUMP: I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition.

The Canadians are taking this seriously, just as they should. President Trump has made it clear he’s an imperialist threat to liberal democracies around the world. And he’s not just “joking” as some apologists often said shortly after the November election, when Trump first floated the idea of invading Panama, annexing Greenland, and making Canada the 51st state. As it happens, Trump has made no such “jokes” against authoritarian countries like Russia. In fact, he’s cozied up to America’s former geopolitical adversaries while threatening some of this country’s best friends.
Trump is a threat to the safety and security of not just Americans but every country of free people around the world. Canada knows it, and theyâre going to fight back however they can.

The last posting on March 6 analyzed the prospects for four of the Magnificent Seven or the “Fab” Seven as some commentators have renamed the group. Let us apply the same approach to Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google), and Tesla. (I added Netflix in the first posting, so we are analyzing the big eight.) The overall stock market is projected to be in a trading range this year. Cycles will be a useful guide in trading the tech heavyweights in 2025.
As we can see below, the Amazon cycle bottoms now. This cycle is synchronized with the Amazon seasonal cycle. From March 3 through July 5, this stock has risen over 80% of the time over the last 27 years. This stock is likely to outperform the technology index.
This cycle points to a low now.
Microsoft cycles are strong until June, but underperformance is likely in the second half of the year. The first half of any year has been bullish. Over the last 38 years, the stock has risen 74% of the time. The cycle is the weakest of the stocks that are under review in the second half of 2025, projecting a weak close to 2025.
This cycle advises us to sell in May. 
The Alphabet monthly rhythm is different from that of most of the other stocks. It traces out a 2025 trading range. There is a low in May followed by a July peak. There is a late October low followed by a strong Q4. Trade the stock.
This stock is in a 2025 trading range.
Tesla peaked before the overall technology stock decline. The stock followed its cycle down. The cycle falls into early June and then rallies for most of the rest of the year. June has been the single strongest month in any year, so the dynamic cycle low is reinforced by the low in the seasonal cycle.
Expect a June low."

To choose the right AI stock for your portfolio, identify a business model you understand and ... [+] confirm the company has the cash flow, value proposition and leadership skill to navigate uncertain economic conditions.
AI stocks are still having a moment, even with some volatility in play. Here's a look at the five best-performing AI stocks over the last 12 months. Will one of these fit well in your portfolio? Read on to find out.
The stock market has been volatile in 2025. Uncertainty about tariffs and federal budget cuts are driving broad instability in stock prices.
AI stocks have been especially reactive. Many AI stocks have high valuations, as investors set prices based on growth prospects rather than past performance. When data suggests the growth outlook has changed, investors react. Stock prices will rise or fall quickly as a result.
You can see the reactivity by tracking an AI ETF like Invesco's AI and Next Gen Software ETF (IGPT). In 2024, IGPT grew as much as 28% before dipping and ending the year with an 11% gain. So far in 2025, the ETF is down 6%. By comparison, the S&P 500 is down 2.3% for the year.
These best AI stocks were chosen by screening on stock price growth over the past year. The stocks with the largest one-year growth percentages and market capitalizations above $2 billion were selected.
The table below includes five best-performing AI stocks, with their market capitalizations and one-year growth trends. For more investing ideas, see best stocks for 2025.
Palantir makes AI-enabled software for counterterrorism, manufacturing efficiency, software management and data analytics. The company serves commercial and government customers. The government business drives more revenue, but the commercial revenue grew faster in 2024.
Palantir is at the forefront of the AI revolution. The company’s software promises to unlock valuable data insights for efficiency and better decision-making, potentially reshaping how businesses and agencies operate.
The stock price has increased more than 200% to the low-$80s in the last 12 months. This includes a February pullback from $125 when investors got nervous about Palantir’s high valuation in light of planned government spending cuts.
The current price point may signal a buying opportunity for AI investors. The company is profitable and growing. Revenue grew 38% in 2024 to $1.9 billion, with double-digit gains in commercial and government sales. The company expects 31% revenue growth this year as well.
Palantir is also flush with cash, holding some $5.2 billion in cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet.
Upstart operates an AI lending platform that uses machine learning models to evaluate credit risk. The company says its solution is more accurate than legacy, credit-score models.
Upstart helps its financial clients approve more loans with lower APRs. According to company data, lenders can approve 101% more applications and deliver 38% lower APRs using Upstart versus a traditional credit evaluation.
UPST stock’s trajectory has been like PLTR's. The USPT stock price is more than 100% in the last 12 months, after a decline that began in February. The downturn followed three analyst price target increases and a positive EPS surprise—indicating investors are concerned about the economy, rather than Upstart specifically.
Upstart grew 2024 revenues 24% and halved its net loss. Income from operations was negative last year, but adjusted EBITDA was a positive $10.6 million. The company has $368 million in cash and a high debt-to-equity ratio of 2.45.
Twilio offers technology solutions supporting personalized customer communications. Using Twilio's platform, marketers can use data and customer actions to authenticate users and trigger tailored text messages and emails.
Twilio has been in the personalized communications space for years. In 2024, the company enhanced its AI functionality with support for developing customer-facing AI assistants. Twilio’s AI Assistants can connect to nearly any data source and integrate with Twilio voice and text campaigns.
Twilio’s move into AI has driven big stock price gains. TWLO is up nearly 74% over the last 12 months. The company also got caught in the technology sell-off last month—in early February, the stock price was nearly $40 higher than now. Twilio did miss the consensus EPS target for the fourth quarter by $0.03, but the miss was followed by at least three analyst price target increases.
Twilio increased 2024 reported revenues by 7% and shrank its GAAP operating loss to $53.7 million from $876.5 million in the prior year. The company has about $2.3 billion in cash and short-term marketable securities on its balance sheet and maintains a low debt-to-equity ratio of 0.14%.
SoundHound provides AI-enabled voice solutions that power automated customer-facing agents. Products include voice assistant, AI chat solutions and generative voice AI for drive-thru ordering.
SoundHound works in agentic AI, a segment predicted to be worth $196.6 billion by 2034. The company says its patented technology comprehends speech faster and provides more accurate responses than other solutions. The technology can potentially reshape industries that rely on direct conversations with customers, including fast food and hospitality.
SoundHound stock has grown about 73% over the last 12 months. The stock price peaked in December just short of $25, before moderating back to about $15 in February and $9.74 in March.
The company's 2024 results, announced in late-February, contributed to the weaker stock price in March. Revenues grew 85% but the GAAP loss per share widened to $0.69 from $0.07. At year-end, SoundHound had no debt and nearly $200 million in cash on hand.
SAP makes enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. Businesses use ERP to manage critical processes in marketing, finance, procurement and more. SAP has the second-highest market share in ERP, behind Microsoft.
SAP incorporates AI functionality into its applications and its Business Technology Platform (BTP). BTP is a comprehensive cloud-based solution supporting data storage and management, AI, analytics, application development and automation. SAP customers can leverage AI capabilities using their business data rather than dated training data.
Nvidia and other hardware providers led the first wave of AI investing as enterprises spent billions building and expanding data centers. As reported by Investors.com, a Goldman Sachs analysis predicts software companies will be next to monetize the AI revolution.
Business decision-makers will invest in AI if it can save money and improve marketing effectiveness. Software providers that deliver these outcomes are the ones that will prevail. Examples include:
Several AI stocks saw a pullback in February, which could signal a buying opportunity. Software providers are particularly attractive because they can provide real business value to their customers. Solutions that offer solid returns will grow the quickest.
AI companies with the cash and leadership savvy to manage growth effectively will pay their shareholders handsomely in stock price gains.
Bottom Line
AI stocks are high-risk, high-reward securities. To choose the right one for your portfolio, identify a business model you understand and confirm the company has the cash flow, value proposition and leadership skill to navigate uncertain economic conditions. If the valuation is acceptable, begin with a small position and increase it as you gain confidence investing in this space.
In terms of stock price growth, Palantir Technologies was one of the best-performing AI stocks of 2024. PLTR grew 349.51% in the year, from about $16.95 in January to nearly $80 by December. 
Some, but not all, AI stocks have high valuations. Palantir Technologies, for example, has a PEG ratio over 6. A PEG ratio higher than 1 can indicate overvaluation.

India’s electric two-wheeler market has been growing exponentially, driven by rising fuel costs, environmental concerns, and government incentives. Brands like Ola, Ather, and TVS have been at the forefront of the e-scooter wave, but Ultraviolette—the company that gave India its first electric superbike, the F77—is stepping in to redefine the segment with its first-ever scooter, the Tesseract. The Tesseract represents a significant evolution in India’s electric mobility narrative – moving beyond basic transportation to deliver a premium, technology-driven experience that doesn’t compromise on performance or range, two factors that have historically limited electric two-wheeler adoption.
The Tesseract’s design language carries forward Ultraviolette’s distinctive aesthetic approach, sharing visual DNA with its elder sibling, the F77. Sharp, angular lines dominate the scooter’s profile, with a muscular stance that immediately distinguishes it from conventional electric scooters. The front features an aggressive LED headlight assembly with signature DRLs that create an unmistakable road presence. Unlike the rounded, approachable designs common in the scooter segment, the Tesseract embraces a more technical, performance-oriented appearance. The bodywork features sculpted panels with aerodynamic considerations, while the floorboard offers a spacious, practical layout without compromising the scooter’s sporty character. Available in four color options, the Tesseract maintains Ultraviolette’s commitment to premium fit and finish, with high-quality materials throughout and attention to detail that elevates it above most competitors in the segment.
Designer: Ultraviolette






On paper, its technical specifications are about as impressive as the e-scooter’s looks. Powered by a 14.91 kW (20.1 bhp) electric motor, it delivers performance numbers typically associated with motorcycles rather than scooters. The scooter accelerates from 0-60 km/h in just 2.9 seconds, with a top speed of 125 km/h (77.6 mph) – figures that put it firmly in the performance category. Battery technology has been a particular focus, with the Tesseract offering three variants with different battery capacities. The top-tier variant boasts an impressive 261 km (160 miles) range on a single charge, addressing one of the primary concerns for electric vehicle adopters – range anxiety. The battery packs are designed for optimal thermal management and longevity, with fast-charging capability that can deliver a significant charge in under an hour. The scooter features a sophisticated suspension setup with disc brakes in the front and rear, complemented by dual-channel ABS for confident braking performance. The chassis has been engineered to balance agility with stability, resulting in handling characteristics that befit its performance capabilities.

Technology is where the Tesseract pulls ahead of the pack. The 7-inch TFT display dashboard is just the start. It comes loaded with features unheard of in the e-scooter segment—dual dashcams (front and back), traction control, hill-hold assist, wireless charging, dynamic stability control, and even haptic feedback on the handlebars. But the real showstopper is the integrated radar system, a first for scooters. Dubbed “Omnisense mirrors,” the setup provides real-time alerts for blind spots, approaching vehicles, and lane-change assistance. For a machine that’s meant to zip through chaotic urban traffic, these safety features could be game-changing.






Smartphone connectivity enables features like ride tracking, over-the-air updates, and customizable ride modes that adjust power delivery and range. Additional premium features include keyless operation, geo-fencing capabilities, anti-theft protection, and remote monitoring through a dedicated mobile app. There’s even a slot to store your phone while you drive, with wireless charging built into it. The scooter also incorporates regenerative braking technology that helps extend range during urban riding conditions.

The under-seat compartment boasts 34 liters of space, enough to swallow a full-face helmet. That’s a big deal in a segment where most e-scooters barely have room for a grocery bag. The build quality, from the sculpted panels to the switchgear, suggests a premium experience, staying true to Ultraviolette’s performance-focused ethos.

Ultraviolette has positioned the Tesseract in the premium segment, with an introductory price of $1,380 (INR 1,20,000) for the first 10,000 customers. The next 50,000 buyers will pay $1,495 (INR 1,30,000), and after that, it settles at $1,667 (INR 1,45,000). The scooter is available in three variants – Tesseract 3.5, Tesseract 5, and Tesseract 6 – each offering different battery capacities and range capabilities. While this pricing places it above many conventional scooters, the Tesseract’s performance specifications, technology integration, and premium build quality position it as a value proposition for tech-savvy consumers seeking a no-compromise electric vehicle. Pre-bookings have already opened, with deliveries scheduled to commence in the first quarter of 2026.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Last Monday, Nothing introduced its brand-new phones, the Phone 3a and the Phone 3a Pro models. They will be available for pre-orders starting this Tuesday (March 11) in certain regions. Meanwhile, the Phone 3a Pro already has a new update bringing camera improvements and more.
It appears Nothing is making sure the Phone 3a Pro’s first experience for users should be hassle-free and is already bringing an update before the device’s availability to the masses. Tipster Ishan Agarwal on X has shared the latest changelog of the Phone 3a Pro update, which seems to have rolled out over the weekend.
Nothing Phone (3a) Pro received another pre-launch OTA.Very interesting 📸 camera update too.You can now share & import Camera Presets. The device also gains support for cube files for custom filters. #Phone3aPro pic.twitter.com/G3tIWUKSjSMarch 9, 2025
The camera enhancements, per the changelog, include new camera presets for quick access, which can be shared and imported. The ability to share these presets also means exchanging your favorite camera settings and filters with others or within the Nothing community.
Additionally, users can also expect support for importing cube files to use their custom filters. For the unaware, (dot)cube is a specific file format for volumetric data that includes a color grading preset.
Other than these additions, in terms of camera, the Phone 3a Pro owners can also experience better overall camera performance, clarity improvements in macro mode, and refinements for portrait for accurate bokeh.

Essential Space is another interesting feature introduced with the Phone 3a series, which is accompanied by a new Essential Key on the phone placed on the right pane. It is AI-powered and, as the name suggests, does essential stuff on your phone, and the new firmware is also bringing improvements to it.
After the update, users can quickly press to save what’s on their screen and “add notes, long press to instantly record voice notes while saving.” Then there are new Essential Space widgets included with the update that let users view their content directly on their home and lock screens.

For a better user experience, Nothing is also revamping the home page and detail page. Moreover, there is also a new “Upcoming” section to manage essential tasks in a single place. Lastly, there are smart insights, which can now be displayed in users’ preferred system language.
On the other hand, there are some other improvements incorporated in the latest firmware, which according to the changelog:

It is encouraging to see Nothing already rolling out updates right before the preorders, which began on March 11. The Phone 3a Pro starts at Rs 29,999 for the 128GB variant, and the 256GB model costs Rs 31,999 for the Indian market. In the U.S., however, the company is selling the Phone 3a series through the Nothing Beta Program.

58,2025-03-10,"With post-election gains in the rear-view mirror, Morgan Stanley’s (MS+1.94%) chief U.S. equity strategist is raising some concerns about the fate of the S&P 500 through at least June. The gist? The Trump bump may morph into a protracted slump.
Mark Wilson said the index could suffer as much as a 5% drop to 5,500 in the first half of 2025 — according to a report cited by Bloomberg — echoing other analysts’ fears regarding the near-term outcomes of tariffs, inflation, and other phenomena that have come to define the early days of President Trump’s second term.
The S&P 500 had fallen about 2.3% today as of 12:21 p.m. in New York. Its intraday low so far is 5,637.75 points. Since January 1, it’s slipped about 3.9%.
Wilson thinks the index may recover to 6,500 by year-end, but “the path is likely to be volatile as the market continues to contemplate these growth risks, which could get worse before they get better.” 
Yet, the strategist warned a full-blown recession could torpedo the index by 20%, adding: “We are not there, but things can change quickly [....].”
Even with fomenting concerns, some analysts have recently offered rosier commentary on at least a few powerhouses in tech and retail:

As the 25th anniversary of the dot-com bubble burst approaches, it’s not crypto bros or meme stock enthusiasts keeping Wall Street veterans up at night. It’s the AI gold rush that has them experiencing déjà vu in technicolor. While Bitcoin’s wild ride and GameStop’s revenge of the retail traders have provided plenty of speculative drama, it’s generative AI that’s triggering the most visceral flashbacks to 2000's tech implosion.
The script feels eerily familiar: breathless pitches, astronomical valuations, and PowerPoints where “generative AI” has simply replaced “e-commerce” in otherwise identical slides. As tech giants pour billions into their AI arms race, investors are left with the trillion-dollar question: Are we witnessing the birth of the next internet, or just another spectacular bubble inflating before our eyes?
Goldman Sachs, for its part, is firmly in the “this time it’s different” camp. The bank’s chief global equity strategist Peter Oppenheimer waves away bubble concerns with a stack of spreadsheets showing the tech sector’s earnings per share have skyrocketed 400% since before the financial crisis, while all other sectors limped along with a measly 25% growth. “The drivers of this success have reflected their ability to leverage software and cloud computing and to fuel high profitability generated by extraordinary demand growth,” Oppenheimer writes. 
But Oppenheimer himself can’t ignore some troubling red flags. A handful of tech behemoths — with Nvidia leading the AI chip charge — now command a staggering portion of the entire market. 
“With markets being increasingly dependent on the fortunes of so few, the collateral damage of stock-specific mistakes is likely to be particularly high,” he writes. Unlike the dot-coms that could launch with little more than a server and a dream, today’s AI players are burning cash at unprecedented rates. “AI is driving a major capex boom and threatens to stifle the high rates of returns that have characterized the sector over the past 15 years,” Oppenheimer points out, sounding less bullish with each revelation.
The market watchers that believes that we are in a bubble aren’t mincing words. Howard Marks, the Oaktree Capital co-founder who correctly called the 2000 crash, plastered “cautionary signs” all over his January investor memo, ominously titled “On Bubble Watch.” Marks points out several alarm bells that are ringing for him: investors chasing returns with disregard for risk, sky-high valuations justified by dubious “new paradigm” arguments, and markets displaying textbook signs of “irrational exuberance.”
Nobel Prize-winnning economist Paul Krugman sees the market barreling toward the same cliff, pointing out that the S&P 500's price-to-earnings ratio is flirting with 30 — uncomfortably close to 1999's level of 93, which Krugman says “looked, and was, crazy.” Krugman does spot one twist in this market rerun: “AI fever is concentrated on a handful of companies — the Magnificent 7 — most of which are already entrenched quasi-monopolies.” (The sassy italics are his.)
Krugman cuts through the AI hype with a question investors should be asking more often: “How much bigger can the market for [Microsoft] Office or Google search get? I understand that these companies feel the need to invest in AI for defensive purposes, to fend off potential competitors. But this need should if anything make them less rather than more profitable.” In other words, Microsoft didn’t spend $13 billion on OpenAI because it needed new customers. It was playing defense in a zero-sum game.
Among the tech bubble forecasters, none sound more alarmed than Gary Marcus, the AI researcher who’s been right before about the technology’s limitations. In his view, we are clearly in a bubble not long for this world, although he doesn’t think generative AI is going anywhere.
“Generative AI itself won’t disappear,” he writes. “But investors may well stop forking out money at the rates they have, enthusiasm may diminish, and a lot of people may lose their shirts.”
For investors caught between FOMO and financial prudence, even Goldman suggests hedging your bets. While dismissing bubble concerns with one hand, the investment bank extends the other with advice to “look to diversify exposure to improve risk-adjusted returns.” Classic Wall Street: bullish in the headlines, cautious in the footnotes.
The real debate isn’t about whether AI changes everything — it’s about timing and who survives to see it. Twenty-five years ago, the internet did transform business, education, and society, just not on the timeline or in the ways dot-com investors expected. Amazon emerged from the wreckage, but only after its stock plunged 90%. Google thrived, but Excite, Lycos, and AltaVista vanished. 
As Marcus points out, today’s AI darlings face a similar reckoning: “Companies that are currently valued at billions of dollars may fold, or [be] stripped for parts. Few of last year’s darlings will ever meet recent expectations.” 
The AI revolution is coming. But revolutions have a way of devouring some of their early and most eager adherents.

Canada's oldest retailer, Hudson's Bay department store, cannot pay its debts. 
The high-end chain, dating back to the 17th-century fur-trade era, has been losing money and shoppers, set back by the pandemic, inflation and lately, trade tensions with the U.S. Now, it's entered a proceeding similar to bankruptcy protection and expects to close some stores. 
""The threat and realization of a trade war has created significant market uncertainty and has impacted our ability to complete these transactions,"" CEO Liz Rodbell said in a statement, referring to recent attempts to shore up investments. 
On Monday, a judge in Toronto granted Hudson's Bay creditor protection, which lets the company try restructuring its debt and regaining financial footing. He began his ruling with a wistful note about the chain:
""It is hard not to have a sense of melancholy when considering the Application before me,"" wrote Justice Peter J. Osborne of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. ""Hudson's Bay is the oldest company in North America and a very prominent Canadian department store. It was founded in 1670. Now, approximately 355 years later, it is insolvent and seeks protection from its creditors.""
Hudson's Bay historically is known for striped wool blankets that were originally traded for beaver pelts. Now it runs about 80 stores, after several waves of closures and layoffs. The chain also has licenses to run some Saks Fifth Avenue and Saks Off 5th locations in Canada — remnants of once-joint ownership. 
The parent company, called HBC, purchased the U.S. chains Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman last year, combined them with Saks and later spun off the Hudson's Bay department-store chain into a standalone entity. HBC is controlled by American real estate mogul Richard Baker, who previously also owned and then sold the luxury chain Lord & Taylor, which later filed for bankruptcy. 
High-end department stores have struggled across North America. The pandemic, a boon for online shopping and work-from-home policies, hurt foot traffic. Then, inflation had people tightening their budgets for non-essentials. And luxury brands — a mainstay of department stores — are increasingly trying to connect directly with shoppers and open their own retail locations. 
In Friday's court filing, Hudson's Bay representatives wrote that the chain was ""facing significant challenges to its ability to make payments,"" including to landlords and suppliers, ""and absent additional funding, will be unable, within the next several days, to meet its employee payroll obligations."" The company listed 9,364 workers.
""While very difficult, this is a necessary step to strengthen our foundation and ensure that we remain a significant part of Canada's retail landscape,"" CEO Rodbell said of filing for creditor protection. ""Now more than ever, it is critical that Canadian businesses are protected and positioned to succeed.""

But I feel compelled to point out that another crap human being is in power running the current administration, and he is basically the enemy of Zuck. And another crap human being who's demonstrated how beholden he is to the current leadership just happens to own the Post and has been flexing his ownership muscles since late last year.
So I have no idea where the truth lay in this tale.
If 'They' are telling us it was considered then  you can bank on it already has happened for a large sum of money to be sure.
These fucking cockroaches need to be exterminated.
Makes one wonder why we even let a being called a ""billionaire"" even exist. What societal benefit is there to be found in such massive concentrations of capital in private hands? Musk, Zuckerberg, the whole lot of them are like sociological and economic black holes, sucking in wealth and free expression of ideas and puking out monetized garbage. They don't even seem to be governed by the notion of noblesse oblige. Money has no meaning for them because they have so much of it, so now it's really purely about the power.
I find it helps to look at the current alleged administration and their sycophants as being participants in Professional Wrestling. They just change the good guys and the bad guys every so often to keep the proles interested in the ""sport"". Do not play along, they are all corrupt.
Just imagine how much worse Zuck would be if he traded MMA training for a penile implant which got botched and how mean that would make him!  (see Musk...)
The only times Zuck looked human to me is in those photos at the capital where he had a ""this is crazy scary"" look on his face while almost surrounded with evil men who make wooden freak like himself think maybe he doesn't want to become a real boy.

Asian equities were mixed but mostly lower overnight as the Philippines and Japan outperformed while Thailand and Hong Kong underperformed.
Both Hong Kong and Mainland China underperformed the region and lost some of their strong gains from last week. However, Mainland investors bought the dip in Hong Kong intensively, pouring nearly $4 billion into Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs on the weakness. There was also a significant rotation into value from growth stocks, continuing what was happening on Friday. However, health care held up better than most growth sectors.
China’s February inflation reading of -0.7% dinted confidence in the current market uptrend. However, there is a significant silver lining here: reversing deflation will require considerable consumer support. At the National People's Congress in Beijing, which is still ongoing, policymakers discussed more consumer stimulus and support for the economy as top priorities. They even indicated a target inflation rate of 2%. Achieving this target would be a feat indeed, and suggests more stimulus than originally anticipated. Meanwhile, Trump's tariffs are also leading to more alacrity from the central government.
Trade data was weaker than expected as both imports and exports declined in February.

Yields on government have seen a slight uptick as stock momentum leads investors to own equities over stocks. We have been saying for months now that the equity risk premium (i.e. what you are paid for investing in stocks versus investing in bonds) in China has been at some of its highest levels in a decade. That gap is starting to close. This also means that policymakers will be more confident in CNY strength, making them better able to stimulate the economy.
Schools in Beijing and other tier-1 are said to be introducing more education to students around AI and digital transformation. This reform to education could benefit names including TAL Education, which has become a premier education technology provider after shifting its focus from private tutoring.
Xpeng was featured at this year’s NPC as the electric vehicle company announced that production of its flying car could begin as soon as 2026. Policymakers stressed the further development of autonomous driving systems, where Baidu leads, and humanoid robots.
The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech indexes both closed lower by -1.85% and -2.52%, respectively, on volume that decreased -21% from Friday. Mainland investors bought a net $3.8 billion worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs overnight via Southbound Stock Connect. The top-performing sectors were Materials, which gained +0.38%, Energy, which gained +0.34%, and Health Care, which gained +0.14%. Meanwhile, the worst-performing sectors were Communication Services, which fell -2.11%, Financials, which fell -1.14%, and Real Estate, which fell -0.96%.
Shanghai, Shenzhen, and the STAR Board all closed lower by -0.19%, -0.01%, and -0.22%, respectively. The top-performing sectors were Energy, which gained +0.75%; Materials, which gained +0.61%; and Industrials, which gained +0.28%. Meanwhile, the worst-performing sectors were Consumer Discretionary, which fell -3.45%, Health Care, which fell -2.62%, and Communication Services, which fell -2.50%.

Shelley Janek, 70, hoped to retire with a strong nest egg at her age. Instead, she's paying bills with Social Security and looking for a job.

        Janek is one of millions of retirees navigating the rising cost of living in the US. Business Insider has heard fromroughly 4,000 older Americans who are struggling to make ends meet on Social Security and dwindling savings. Some, such as Janek, have told BI they're unable to retire or trying to reenter the job market to boost their income, while others are scrambling to cut their expenses.
    

        With just over $2,000 a month in Social Security income, Janek is unable to afford most essentials, such as groceries and rent, she said. She recently moved from Sonoma County, California — where she lived for 34 years — to Casper, Wyoming. She's living with a friend to save money and applying for jobs, with no luck yet.
    

        ""Everything is just climbing so dramatically that I think seniors are going to be in some real trouble in the future,"" she told BI.
    

We want to hear from you. Are you an older American comfortable sharing your retirement outlook with a reporter? Please fill out this quick form.


        Janek spent her career in various roles in finance, computer programming, and environmental conservation. She said she felt financially comfortable for most of her life but never made enough money to buy her own home in Sonoma County, where median home prices are nearly twice the national average — according to the real estate platform Redfin.
    

        Janek said that in 2021, she had to retire earlier than she expected and claim Social Security because of a health condition. She spent most of the money she saved for retirement on bills and caring for her mother.
    

        She said it had been challenging to land a new job at her age. At some companies, she never hears back after submitting her application. At others, she doesn't pass the interview stage. She said she hadn't been able to land afull-time job and is unable to work in retail or the service industry because she can't stand for long periods of time.
    

        This past summer, Janek moved to Wyoming in an effort to cut her living costs. She said utilities and gas are cheaper in Casper, and she saves on rent because she's staying with a friend, but there are fewer healthcare options than she had on the West Coast. Janek said she would qualify for some low-income housing, but she's been on waiting lists in California, Wyoming, and neighboring states for years without a placement.
    

        ""It's depressing to realize that there's very few places I can afford to live,"" she said. ""And the few places I could afford to live are not places I really want to live. It's looking like I may have to leave the country.""
    

        Moving again could make Janek's life more affordable, but she said it would come at the expense of her community. Relocating has already been lonely, she said, and it's been difficult to reestablish care with new doctors and meet new friends.
    

        Janek isn't sure what she'll do next, but she said it helps to know that she isn't alone: Many older Americans are struggling with finances in retirement.
    

        ""I think there are a lot of people in my situation,"" she said.

68,2025-03-10,"Tesla stock officially traded lower Monday than it did ahead of President Donald Trump’s November victory, wiping out what was once a 91% gain for shares of the electric vehicle company run by Trump lieutenant Elon Musk, as Tesla becomes the face of the ongoing stock market slide.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk speaks at a Tesla event in 2022.
Shares of Tesla declined more than 15% to $222, closing at their lowest share price since Oct. 23, two weeks before the election.
Monday was Tesla’s worst percentage loss since September 2020 and the 7th-worst day in the company’s 15-year history on public markets, according to FactSet data.
The dive came as part of broader losses tied to concerns about Trump’s economic policies, as the tech-concentrated Nasdaq Composite dropped 4% and crossed into 10% correction territory.
And driving down Tesla shares specifically was a note from UBS analyst Joseph Spak calling for Tesla’s 2025 vehicle deliveries to decline by 5%, which would be the second consecutive year of negative growth for Tesla, moving against consensus analyst forecasts of 12% vehicle delivery growth this year.
Tesla stock is down more than 53% from its all-time high set in December, when its share price took off on the prospect of friendly Trump administration policies toward the heavily regulated company.
$144.4 billion. That’s how much lower Musk’s $319.6 billion net worth is than his record $464 billion set in December, according to our latest calculations. Musk, Tesla’s largest shareholder, is still worth roughly $110 billion more than any other person on Earth. Musk’s net worth fell by $23 billion Monday amid Tesla stock’s drop.
Tesla stock is down 12% since Election Day. Its market capitalization is down close to $800 billion from its December peak.
Musk, who donated $288 million toward Trump and other GOP election efforts, has dedicated much of the last few months to his position as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a commission Trump created to oversee cost cutting and government employee layoffs. Tesla is one of the American firms most directly affected by Trump’s tariffs, as China is the company’s second-largest market and Tesla’s cars rely on parts from Canada, China and Mexico. Beyond tariffs, Tesla stock has been weighed down by reports of significantly lower sales to open 2025 in China and Europe as analysts warn Musk’s outspoken politics are eating into Tesla’s brand reputation.

TSLA Stock
 
Amid ongoing tariff conflicts and the bold initiatives of the new Trump administration, Tesla stock experienced a significant decline recently, dropping more than -31.6% in under 30 days as of 2/28/2025. Is this dip a buying opportunity? Buying the dip can be a viable strategy for quality stocks when overall market conditions are favorable, especially if the stock has a history of rebounding from such downturns. In fact, Tesla not only meets basic fundamental quality checks but has historically returned an average of 131% in one year and achieved a peak return of 183% following similar dips. While history can be a guide, it does not always repeat. There is risk in fighting the trend, and what may be opportunity is also hard to time. See How Low Can Tesla Stock Go In A Market Crash?
It has been under one month since TSLA last experienced a significant dip event – defined as a drop of over 30% within 30 days – and since then, it has returned -10.1%.
 The table below compares period-wise returns from the current dip event with historical medians. In this instance, only past median returns are available because the current dip event occurred very recently.
TSLA current dip compared with historical medians 
Since 1/1/2010, TSLA has experienced 10 events where the dip threshold of -30% within 30 days was triggered.
TSLA Past Data On Recovery From Dips
To reduce the risk that a dip signals a deteriorating business situation, factors such as revenue growth, profitability, cash flow, and balance sheet strength must be considered. Tesla easily meets these criteria.
TSLA Financial Quality Checks
Although dip buying is appealing, it must be evaluated carefully from multiple perspectives. This multi-factor analysis is exactly how we construct Trefis portfolio strategies. If you seek upside with a smoother ride than that of an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and achieved returns of over 91% since its inception.

72,2025-03-10,"The Chinese internet and social media ecosystem is a heavily censored pool, one that aggressively bans and removes any content that is deemed unaligned to the government policies. One of the reasons why Western social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram could never make an inroad in the market is due to that extensive censorship and local data regulation laws.
Meta, however, was reportedly eager to enter the Chinese market and with such eagerness that it was willing to share user data with the Chinese government and create a complex censorship filter, as well. The revelations come as part of a complaint filed by a Meta whistleblower, which contained internal documents and communication viewed by The Washington Post.
Filed before the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by former Director of Public Policy at Facebook, Sarah Wynn-Williams, the 78-page complaint that the social media juggernaut created a China-favoring censorship system in China in hopes of launching Facebook in the country.
According to The Post, the Mark Zuckerberg-led company also “planned to install a “chief editor” who would decide what content to remove and could shut down the entire site” during times of social unrest. The company is claimed to have created a dedicated team for its planned China operations as part of an internal project codenamed “Aldrin.”
But more than just creating a censorship system, Meta also was reportedly willing to stifle dissent against the government. “Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg also agreed to crack down on the account of a high-profile Chinese dissident living in the United States following pressure from a high-ranking Chinese official the company hoped would help them enter China,” says the report citing the complaint.
Furthermore, the company was even willing to loosen its privacy rules and grant the Chinese government access to data covering China as well as Hong Kong-based users. The plans kicked into motion in 2014, but were ultimately abandoned in 2019 when diplomatic relations between the US and China were strained.
Meta won’t be the only player with such ambitions. Back in 2018, Google was reportedly working on a heavily censored version of Search under the codename “Project Dragonfly,” but the plans were ultimately put on cold ice. As of 2025, AI is the new tech hunting ground, and the spectre of Chinese censorship is clearly visible on products such as the DeepSeek open-source AI model
.
Meta has reportedly shelved plans to make a smartwatch, codenamed Milan, that would come equipped with two cameras. As per a Bloomberg report, the company's first smartwatch was slated to debut next year with a price tag of $349. However, the company has now canceled plans for mass production, apparently as a cost-cutting measure.
As per images of the prototype shared in the report, Meta's smartwatch had a squircle display with a flat profile and a gold casing. The first 5MP camera sat on the front, positioned in a notch at the bottom of the screen. A more powerful 12MP camera was placed at the back, resting against wearer's the wrist.
The other day, if you were scrolling through Twitter and avoiding Eternals spoilers and politics, you might have seen a tweet from David Imel from the MKBHD team. He was checking out the latest Pixel 6 and a Moment case, and he noticed that Moment seemed to have included MagSafe-compatible magnets with the case. Sure enough, he popped it on a MagSafe charger, and not only did the charger stick, it started charging the phone. You can watch the video below.

The Google Pixel 9a is here and it has a brand new look, some new features, a tempting price, and a very tough time ahead of it. The curvy shape of the Google Pixel 8a has gone, replaced by a flat rear panel and flat sides. Not only that, but the iconic Pixel visor-style camera module has disappeared too, and the two cameras have been integrated into the back of the phone. That’s right, there’s no camera bump at all, making it look very unusual in 2025.
Whether you already miss the best design Google has ever come up with on its phones will be down to your personal taste, but if you get the Pixel 9a in the right color, it’ll still make a statement. Along with the ordinary Porcelain and Obsidian (white and black to you and me) models, there are two eye-catching versions: the purple Iris and the red-pink Peony. The Pixel 9a has an IP68 dust and water resistance rating, the rear is made from plastic, and the chassis is aluminum.

74,2025-03-10,"President Donald Trump’s net worth fell nearly $300 million Monday, continuing a months-long slide as Trump Media & Technology Group shares tumbled over 11% and reached their lowest point since October.
Trump's estimated net worth is $4.6 billion. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)
Trump’s net worth fell $296 million to $4.6 billion as of 5 p.m. EDT, marking a $2.4 billion decrease since mid-January, when the president’s net worth surged amid a Trump Media rally.
Trump Media’s stock closed down 11.4% to $19.92 per share, its lowest trading price in five months.
Trump Media shares are now down 41% in 2025 after opening the year at $34.02.
The fall in Trump Media shares occurred alongside a broader stock market selloff, with the S&P 500 falling to a six-month low, the Nasdaq Composite tumbling 4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 2.1%.
The drop has been attributed to Trump not ruling out a recession in 2025 and saying “you can’t really watch the stock market,” which were comments he made in a Fox News interview that aired on Sunday.

Tesla chief and billionaire Trump aide Elon Musk also suffered from Monday’s stock market flop, losing $22.8 billion in net worth as Tesla shares fell over 15% and closed at their lowest price since Oct. 23. We estimate Musk’s net worth at $319.6 billion, which still makes him by far the wealthiest person in the world—more than $100 billion clear of No. 2 Jeff Bezos—but he’s more than $140 billion poorer than when his estimated net worth hit a record $464 billion in December.
It has been nearly one year since Trump Media went public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company. The Truth Social parent company ended 2024 with $777 million in cash, reporting $401 million in net losses amid increases to research and development expenses and stock compensation expenses. Trump owns about 115 million shares of Trump Media and began the year with a roughly $7 billion estimated net worth. The president, who has put controversial tariffs in place against China, as well as allies like Canada and Mexico, cautioned during his interview with Fox on Sunday about a span of economic “transition.” His comments “did nothing to ease investor concerns about ongoing policy chaos,” according to Sevens Report founder Tom Essaye.

In the intricate world of estate planning and administration, accurately estimating the market value of collectibles, such as sports memorabilia, antique firearms, or rare trading cards, are often overlooked both in estate planning and in estate administration.

80,2025-03-10,"Two new phones are out from the brand, but neither supports Qi2.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Nothing just released the Phone 3a and 3a Pro, and both are wonderful devices. Unfortunately, neither phone comes with wireless charging, let alone the latest Qi2 wireless charging standard, as I was hoping. However, with the Nothing Phone 3 in the works, the company has an opportunity to make the ultimate Qi2 accessories of my dreams.
Qi2 is one of those novel features that has been much harder for the industry to adopt. Even market-leading brands like Samsung have struggled with its implementation. So, it's not exactly shocking news that a budget company like Nothing decided to skip the magnetic wireless charging option altogether.
It's not like no phone from the brand has ever had wireless charging support. The original Nothing Phone 1 was one of the first cheap Android phones to bring wireless charging to the sub-$500 segment. Following that release, the succeeding Nothing Phone 2 also supported 15W wireless charging. Unfortunately, the brand's cheaper ""a"" models forgo both Qi and Qi2 wireless charging options.

My expectations were super high with the new Nothing phones. Some might even say unreasonably high, but why shouldn't they be? Smartphones are extremely, outrageously, unapologetically fun these days. They can fold in halves and threes, survive rounds in the dishwasher, and even be transparent!
Nothing took a bold risk that paid off with its insanely cool see-through Android phones that come with LEDs baked into the back. It's this courage to try something unique, even if not entirely practical, that gave me hope to see Qi2 on an affordable, transparent Android phone.
Even if the Phone 3a and 3a Pro don't have Qi2, I'm still going to hold out hope for the Phone 3. Can you imagine how futuristic a magnetic transparent smartphone would look like? And don't even get me started on the accessories.
The brand does accessories really well, bringing that transparent, techy aesthetic to earbuds. More impressively, Nothing succeeded in creating a functional modular Android phone where companies like Google previously failed. This shows promise.
Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android

According to an allegedly leaked email from the CEO of Nothing, the Phone 3 is rumored to launch in the first quarter of this year. I'm shifting gears and turning my gaze towards the future. I can't wait to see what Carl Pei has in store for us.
A clear phone with lights encased in a glass back is unique enough — now picture a Qi2 coil incorporated into that blueprint. Nothing will probably do all that and still maintain the water and dust-proof integrity of the device. It's going to be an epic phone if it matches my imagination.
You can't have a see-through magnetic phone without companion accessories. I love anything MagSafe or Qi2, so my number one want from the brand is a transparent Qi2 power bank. Guess what? I'm not alone in my musings.
A user named 3DPrintedCat took to the Nothing Community forum to share their mockup conceptual renders of what a Nothing Qi2 wireless power bank would look like. They decided to dub it the ""Battery (1),"" which is right on the money when it comes to Nothing's branding.
The product concept is sleek, minimal, and highly modern. The clean white ensemble and circular lights inside the Qi2 coil have me drooling. Flat metal sides look so flattering on power banks and battery packs. It's impressive how this fan-made ""Battery (1)"" concept is so in sync with Nothing's design language.
If Carl Pei does not deliver on such expectations, it's not just me who's going to be very let down. Clearly, many fans are also dying to see such an evolutionary product from Nothing.
The first quarter of 2025 is almost up, so if the rumors are true, we'll find out very soon whether the Nothing Phone 3 launch will meet our expectations or fail to deliver.

Located near the Triple Bridge, the part open-air, part covered Tržnice Central Market in Ljubljana is another of architect Jože Plečnik’s designs. A sign of his forward-thinking, the market needed no renovations since it first opened in 1939. It includes a winding column-lined portico (Plečnik loved columns and sometimes stuck them places where they didn’t support anything, just because he liked them) and separate areas for butchers (one the ground level) and fishmongers (the lower level, nearer the river where they once disposed of organic leftovers). 
The fruit and vegetables are sold in open stalls—be sure to stop by the sauerkraut stall run by Marjetka Zabjek, a local legend whose family sells an indigenous cabbage that makes the best sauerkraut. You can also get sour turnip (which sounds kind of dreadful but is delicious, sauerkraut made with turnip instead of cabbage)—a perfect side served with sausage and dressed in cracklings, to warm you up on an alpine evening. 
A vending machine run by a family dairy farm sells unpasteurized, fresh raw milk, yogurt, and cheese 24/7. You can also take home a souvenir jewel-colored candle—just be aware that while they may look like lovely decorative objects for the home, they’re designed to adorn the graves of your loved ones. Tomb candles or grave candles are often used in celebration of All Souls' Day in Slovenia. 
An indoor part of the market beneath a Jesuit seminary houses stalls selling bread, cheese, cured meats, baked goods, and more. Every Friday outside of wintertime one square of the market hosts a popup food stand festival called Odprta Kuhna (Open Kitchen), founded by Israeli expat Lior Kochavy. It is hugely popular, with dozens of street food options and as many as 20,000 people converging for a Friday meal or two. This is a great place to feel Ljubljana at its most vibrant, to meet locals, people watch and taste your way through the best of the capital. 
The market is closed on Sundays. Note that opening times vary slightly depending on the season.

Many CEOs have been selling their own companies' stock in February and early March. 
Company insiders are ditching their own stock more than usual. An exception is oil and gas executives, some of whom are buying while their shares are depressed.
To gauge insider sentiment, look at the ratio of buys to sells by top executives and large shareholders. According to Gurufocus.com, about 34% of insiders’ transactions normally are buys. In February the figure was only 24%.
During the early stages of the pandemic in 2020, when stock prices dived, insiders stepped up to the plate and bought shares at an above-normal clip five months in a row. Insiders also bought a lot of stock in the late stages of the Great Recession in 2008.
Sells normally exceed buys because top executives get some stock (often in the form of stock options) as part of their compensation. Lately, we’ve seen ten months in a row of below-normal buying.
According to a screen I did on Gurufocus.com, chief executive officers at 197 companies have sold stock worth $1 million or more from February 1 through March 5.
At Palo Alto Networks Inc. (PANW), CEO Nikesh Arora sold more than $275 million of stock in February and March. Since June 2022, his share holding has fallen from about 2.9 million shares to about 1.1 million shares. His sales were under a plan that provides for selling at predetermined intervals or prices.
At JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), chairman Jamie Dimon was a buyer in 2007, 2009, 2012, and 2016. Since last year he’s been a seller. In February he sold $233 million of stock, or more than 11% of his holding. His remaining shares are worth about $1.6 billion.
At Tempus AI Inc. (TEM), which went public less than a year ago, CEO Eric Lefkofsky cashed in more than $119 million in shares in February. That was about 8% of his holding.
Bahram Akradi, the founder and CEO of Life Time Group Holdings Inc. (LTH), sold 31% of his shares in late February, for proceeds of about $150 million. The company operates a chain of fitness centers. Akradi himself is a triathlete.
When CEOs sell shares, it doesn’t necessarily mean that they are bearish on the stock market or on their own companies’ prospects. There are many reasons to sell, simple diversification being one.
Still, when I see the number of CEOs who have sold recently, and the volume of their sales, it gives me an uneasy feeling.
In the oil and gas industry I see more hopeful signs.
At Noble Corp., for example, CEO Robert Eifler spent about $350,000 to add a bit to his holdings, which amount to about $31 million at current prices. Richard Barker, the chief financial officer, bought about $223,000 of Noble shares in February and has about $7 million in the stock.
At Dorchester Minerals LP (DMLP), which collects royalties on oil-and-gas properties in 28 states, CEO Bradley Ehrman spent about $100,000 on his partnership’s shares in early March. He has about $4 million in it.
And at Matador Resources Co. (MTDR), where I’ve noted insider buying previously, CEO Joseph Foran made four purchases totaling about $632,000. That brings his holding to about $245 million.
Oil and gas stocks are out of favor today, and I think they are oversold. I believe these three CEOs will be happy about their purchases a year hence.
This is the 73rd column I’ve written about insider purchases and sales. I can tabulate results for 63 columns — all those written from 1999 through a year ago.
Stocks that I said to avoid, even though insiders were buying, have under-performed the Standard & Poor’s 500 Total Return Index by 24.3 percentage points.
Stocks where I noted insider selling have done 2.3 percentage points worse than the index.
Stocks I recommended based on insider buying have returned 9.1% -- not too bad, but 1.3 percentage points below the benchmark’s average.
Finally, there were some stocks where I noted insider buys, but made no comment or an ambiguous comment. These have beaten the S&P by 16.2 percentage points.
Bear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn’t be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn’t predict the future.
Disclosure: I own JPMorgan shares personally and for most of my clients. "
83,2025-03-10,"Last week, Caleb Denison and I got the chance to spend some time at LG headquarters for closer looks at the 2025 models announced at CES in January. Sure, the majority of the excitement the past couple months has been around WOLED technology taking a pretty big step forward. The G5 is getting rid of MLA (Micro Lens Array) technology and the existing three layer structure — consisting of a single yellow/green/red layer between two blue layers — and instead using a four-layer stack with separate red, green, and (two) blue layers. It’s right for this kind of news to get top headlines in the AV world, but after last week, I’m equally interested in the oft-forgotten LG OLED series — the B series.
The best of the best G series steals attention because it debuts the new tech each year and is the best OLED, and the C series is the best mix of performance and value, while the B series patiently waits its turn for coverage. There’s only so many days in the year, and only so may TVs that can be reviewed in that time. But the B5 looks very intriguing, and it worthy of a bit of a callout.
Year-over-year improvements aren’t as drastic as they used to be even five years ago. TVs, from budget to high-end, are all at least pretty good. And the trickle down of performance has real impact on the lower tiers. Look at the surprise, inexpensive introduction of the Sansui OLED last year, or the newly announced Philips OLED Roku TV. What used to be a market that didn’t exist, or wasn’t worth recommending, now has multiple players.
Judging by some of the numbers we saw this week, an OLED tier is a few years behind the tier above it. So the LG C5 performance looks possibly comparable to the LG G2, which would put the B5 on par with the LG C2 — a very good OLED TV. When people asked me what TV they should buy in 2022 (and even into 2023 before it left the market), the C2 was the quick, easy, and obvious answer. I’d still be happy with it today (and my friends who bought it, are).
During the opening presentation, we learned that the B5 would be available in an 83-inch model and…that’s it. No other size was listed in the powerpoint. Fast forward an hour, and there we were, looking at a gaming demonstration on a B5 that was most certainly 77 inches and not 83. After some questions, we found out that, yes, the B5 will be available in sizes ranging from 55 to 83 inches — the question is availability. Smaller sizes will only be available from certain retailers, but LG was not prepared to reveal which retailers just yet. We’ll likely get the news in coming weeks (or a couple months, at most).
Once pricing is released (I don’t expect the recently announced EU prices to accurately represent the North American B5 pricing) we’ll get a better sense of where things stand and how the B5 will stack up against the Philips and Sansui OLEDs (or maybe something that hasn’t been revealed yet). Going by my eyes last week, though, entry-level OLED competition is about to get heated.
For a long time, we've thought of Roku as the streaming media king. Not just because its software is so easy to use and its devices so affordable, but also because of its popularity -- the company has traditionally enjoyed a much larger share of the streaming market than its competitors. But it looks like the company's contentious relationships with some of the biggest names in streamed entertainment may be hurting that reputation: Amazon has just announced that its Fire TV platform has hit 50 million monthly active users on its devices globally, a number that comfortably edges out Roku, which reported 46 million monthly active users in November.
It took Roku a number of months to solve its differences with NBCUniversal's Peacock, but a similar dispute with entertainment giant HBO Max continues, with no end in sight. These spats alone don't necessarily account for Roku's slower growth when compared to Amazon's Fire TV, especially given that both Peacock and HBO Max are U.S.-only services right now. Other factors include the aggressive rollout and pricing of Amazon's new Fire TV devices, which in some cases deliver more features for less money than the equivalent Roku devices. Amazon's Alexa is now built into every Fire TV device, as one example.
We've been talking up the possibilities of Bluetooth's broadcast audio tech known as Auracast for some time now. And while we've been seeing it emerge more recently in devices such as Bluetooth speakers and headphones, in a world-first the wireless audio innovation has been installed in the iconic Sydney Opera House to help those with hearing needs rediscover their love for live music.
You'd be forgiven if you haven't heard of Auracast, but the technology, developed by Bluetooth's governing body, the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG), in a nutshell, uses Bluetooth's super-efficient Low Energy (LE) Audio standard to allow high-quality audio to be broadcast from a Auracast-enabled transmitting devices to Auracast-enabled audio receivers -- in this case, hearing aids and headphones. Users can tune into the specific broadcasts using an app or other interface.
There’s really no such thing as a “non-smart TV” these days. Still, there are those of us rocking some vintage AV tech that refuses to die, and many older TVs cannot connect to Wi-Fi. If this sounds like your household, then we’re glad to bring the following offer to your attention: Right now, the Roku Express HD is marked down to $18 from $30. The last time this streaming device was this cheap was July 2024.
We tested an older version of the Roku Express back in November 2019, and reviewer Simon Cohen said, “With everything you need, and nothing more, the new Roku Express is a bargain of a streamer.”

85,2025-03-10,"From the Beetle to the Rabbit to the Golf, Volkswagen has long made affordable, practical cars that those with smaller budgets can afford. Now they're aiming that prowess at the EV market with the unveiling of their ID EVERY1.


 

 
The concept car is intended to make the transition into production for €20,000 (USD $21,667) in 2027. Hailed as ""affordable entry-level all-electric mobility"" by Thomas Schäfer, CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, the 94hp vehicle will reportedly have a range of 155 miles.



 
 
Aesthetically, the vehicle was designed to have a friendly, approachable look. ""Our ambition was to create something bold yet accessible,"" says Andreas Mindt, Volkswagen's Head of Design. ""The ID EVERY1 has a self-assured appearance but remains likeable – thanks to details such as the dynamic front lights and the 'smiling' rear. These design elements make it more than just a car: they give it character and an identity that people can relate to.""













The big question for Americans is whether that €20,000 sticker will apply in 2027, given the way our current administration's tariff war is going. The point may be moot; sadly, VW has announced no plans to bring this affordable EV to the U.S. market. With any luck things will change in two years' time.



I wonder what leaves us first: Trump or your 110 Volt ;-)
Don't get ahead of yourself, lets start with the metric system ! 
VW design is still struggling. I really fail to see how this is an improvement on the more than 10 year old Up! and all the concepts that proceeded it.
I love the design, it looks like a VW! I only wish they would bring it to production as is and sell it in the US... those seem like 2 big asks right now.

Major stock indexes tanked Monday, continuing a sell-off that gathered steam last week as rattled investors began zeroing in on the prospect of a significant falloff in U.S. growth amid persistent inflation and a wobbling job market. 
The broad S&P 500 index closed down 2.7%. Not only has it now given up all of President Donald Trump's post-election gains, it fell to its lowest level since September and is essentially unchanged over the past seven months. It was the biggest one-day drop since December. 
The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 4% as it plunged deeper into ""correction"" territory, meaning it is off more than 10% from recent highs. It was its worst day since 2022. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped nearly 900 points, or roughly 2.1%.
Recession fears were heightened this weekend after Trump declined to say that there wouldn’t be one. In an interview with Fox News that aired Sunday, Trump responded to a question about the possibility of a recession by saying the economy was going through “a period of transition.”
On Monday, a White House official said it's more important to look at the longer term. 
""Want to emphasize that we're seeing a strong divergence between (the) animal spirits of the stock market and what we’re actually seeing unfold from businesses and business leaders,"" the official said. ""The latter is obviously more meaningful than the former on what’s in store for the economy in the medium to long term.""
In a note to clients, Goldman Sachs analysts downgraded their growth prospects for the U.S. — the first time since 2022 that they had done so — citing ""considerably more adverse"" trade environment as a result of Trump's tariff policy. The firm now sees growth averaging 1.7% for 2025, down from 2.4%, with the tariffs creating a drag via higher consumer prices, higher borrowing costs and delayed investment due to uncertainty. 
Few major firms were spared from Monday's drawdown. Nvidia, which has led markets higher over the past couple of years amid the AI investment boom, was down more than 4%, and is now off 22% year to date. Other major losers included Apple, Microsoft and Tesla, which was down more than 10%. The electric vehicle maker has also given up all its post-election gains as CEO Elon Musk has become a ubiquitous presence in Trump's White House. 
Even before debates about how protests against Musk and Tesla have affected shares, flagging sales in Europe and especially China, Tesla’s most important market, were already taking a bite out of the company’s value. Those anti-Musk protest have largely been in response to the tech billionaire's leadership of Trump's Department of Government Efficiency.
Crypto, too, was hit Monday, with bitcoin prices falling below $80,000 for the first time since Trump's election and despite the White House convening the first-ever crypto summit Friday after announcing the creation of ""strategic bitcoin reserve"" — though some investors were left disappointed by the details. 
Shares in Coinbase, the U.S.'s largest crypto exchange, fell 10% Monday and has likewise erased its post-election gains.
Investors are up in arms about Trump's seemingly chaotic economic policy. The president has repeatedly started, then stopped the imposition of tariffs on America's largest trading partners, while he and Musk have implemented drastic cuts to the federal workforce that threaten to swamp an already shaky jobs market with additional workers. 
“We are in the throes of a manufactured correction,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, told CNBC. ""I say manufactured because it’s really based in response to the new administration’s tariff programs, or at least threats of tariffs, and what kind of an impact that will have on the economy.""
At the same time, Stovall said, many traders may simply be locking in gains or taking profits from markets that had reached all-time highs under the Biden administration. 
“Right now we’re going through a typical pullback and probably will experience a mild correction before all is completed, which actually would be good for the resetting of the dials of this ongoing bull market,” he said.

From the Association of American Railroads (AAR) Rail Time Indicators.  Graphs and excerpts reprinted with permission. 
Uncertainty shapes economic cycles — fueling booms, 
triggering busts, and driving debates about what comes 
next. Uncertainty abounds in the railroad industry too, 
where evolving demand, market conditions, and 
economic policies constantly create both challenges 
and opportunities. 
... 
For now, both rail traffic and the broader economy 
reflect a mix of strengths and weaknesses, with some 
sectors proving resilient while others struggle in the 
face of shifting conditions.
emphasis added
 Click on graph for larger image.

This graph from the Rail Time Indicators report shows the year-over-year change for carloads, carloads ex-coal, and intermodal.
In February, intermodal performance was again 
strong, with volumes rising 6.4% (66,340 units) year
over-year. Originations averaged 276,654 units per 
week, the most ever for a February. This strength 
reflects solid consumer spending and, in part, efforts 
by some importers to expedite shipments in anticipation 
of tariffs.
...
U.S. railroads originated 843,618 carloads in February, 
down 4.5% from last year. Carloads rose fractionally in 
January, their first increase in five months. In February, 
severe floods in the Northeast and frigid temperatures 
in the upper Midwest and much of the rest of the 
country constrained rail operations and the ability of rail customers to load and unload freight. Without these 
weather issues, rail volumes likely would have been higher.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Joe DePasquale, founder of the Joe Hollywood brand. It has been edited for length and clarity.

        Growing up, I didn't have much. My dad was involved in drugs, and my mom struggled with a mental illness that sometimes made it difficult for her to even go outside. It was a really difficult atmosphere. I remember coming home one day to strangers at our house; it was the local church dropping off donations for us.
    

        My prized possessions were my sports cards. My grandfather bought me my first pack when I was 8, and I absolutely treasured the cards even as I got older. I went to college in Manhattan and missed many classes because I was buying cards for 5 or 10 cents on the street corner.
    

        Eventually, I dropped out of college to take a job in finance, making $200 a week. That job felt like a bridge between where I was and where I could be. I moved up the corporate ladder, eventually reaching leadership in my finance company. But I never felt fully financially secure, especially seeing firsthand how tumultuous the market can be.
    

        All the while, I was still buying trading cards until I had more than half a million of them. I rented a storage unit to keep them all. In 2022, I relocated from New York City to Atlanta for my finance job. I had my dream house and decided to bring my cards home. They filled almost my basement, so my wife, Dori, suggested it was time to sell some.
    

        My oldest son, Joe Jr., was 10 at the time. He was excited by the idea, so we started selling cards online and eventually on WhatNot, a livestreaming marketplace. At first, we were filming in the basement boiler room; the show would end when my phone battery died. As we sold more, we moved to my younger son's train table and eventually to the Ping-Pong table.
    

        Soon, we outgrew that, and I could justify converting a bedroom into a home office for selling cards. Last year, my company did more than $5 million in sales on WhatNot.
    

        I don't like to talk about my personal wealth or net worth. But it's clear my three children, who are now 13, 10, and 6, are growing up very differently than I did.
    

        We like to travel as a family, including a recent Thanksgiving trip to the Bahamas. Dori and I also do smaller trips with just one of our children at a time. We're preparing to take Joe Jr. to Disney — he's never been, and neither have I. This past fall, we took our daughter to New York City and did everything she wanted, including seeing the Rockettes. Our youngest wanted to eat grilled cheese on the beach, so we took him to Turks and Caicos.
    

        Because of my success, I can spend quality time with each of my kids. That makes up for the fact that my quantity of time is sometimes limited since I stream for 24 hours each Friday through Saturday. I still reserve Sundays for faith and family, though.
    

        I want my children to have access to every resource they need to succeed. Joe Jr. loves basketball, so I pay for every basketball team or clinic he asks for. Whether it's dance lessons or tutoring, I'm willing to spend on it. I want my kids to work for their success, but I'll be right at their side as they do.
    

        I know the differences resources can make. My mom didn't have money but wanted me to attend a private high school. She asked my grandmother to pay for my schooling; in exchange, my mom didn't get anything in the will when my grandmother died since the tuition was her inheritance. I'm lucky not to have to make difficult choices like that, but I'm motivated to give everything I can to my kids.
    

        More than anything, I want my children to grow up in a positive, encouraging environment. They'll need to work hard and be leaders, but I want them to know life isn't just about making money; it's about being a good person.

UTA’s Co-Head of Media Rights, Jason Richman, is feeling reflective after one of the most shocking beginnings to a year the entertainment industry can remember. The prominent lit exec is considering how the industry has been recovering from the California wildfires that tore through neighborhoods in January, as he prepares for the London Book Fair (LBF), kicking off thousands of miles away this week in the UK. Richman will be repping the likes of Adam Kay’s thriller A Particularly Nasty Case and Jemimah Wei’s The Original Daughter and sees the event as a reset opportunity for the international book-to-screen market.

	










	“The fires in L.A. were an awful way to start the year,” he tells us. “As L.A. heals, rebuilds, and transitions into our new normal, the film and TV industry is ramping back up. Lots of new development has commenced, and there seems to be a renewed energy and excitement to escape into a great book and help shepherd its journey to screen.”

	In a volatile economic climate, many will be hoping Richman’s sentiment manifests at the LBF, where hoards of TV and film executives will attend alongside the great and the good of the literary business. In recent years, one of the busiest weeks in the publishing calendar has seen something of a small and big screen invasion, as producers and agents sniffing out the next Normal People, Lessons in Chemistry or Conclave descend on the English capital to see what’s what.

	This year, sources predict the LBF will be packed full of TV and film folk, but in a market battling multiple headwinds, and with many book-to-screen projects currently stuck in limbo, there are question marks over getting projects over the line.

	“Agents are skeptical about those big-name TV companies who were going in and buying expensive book options with these huge claims, and now nothing has happened,” one producer tells us. “When film and TV agents send catalogs out to producers there are lots of books you see and you just think, ‘Oh my god that’s out of option.’ We are a long way from the craziness of 2022.”

	That “craziness” saw dozens of British books taken on for option by the big American players during what was a post-Covid boom era for the TV drama industry. But three years on, the UK TV industry has been rocked by the revelation that a number of high-profile projects for pubcasters are effectively stuck in limbo as big American players pull out of the co-pro market, with a number of these projects understood to be book adaptations. One high-profile example we revealed recently is the BBC’s adaptation of Douglas Stuart’s Booker Prize winner Shuggie Bain. “The big literary titles are really struggling,” says the producer. 

	










	United Agents’ Jen Thomas is repping a number of novels and clients at the LBF and says there is “slightly more caution” than in previous years, with buyers mostly keen to see how well books perform post-publication rather than snapping novels up before they come out.

	But Thomas notes that the market “feels resilient” and says her diary is stuffed full of meetings. “We’ve not had any big ticket items that have stalled,” she adds. “This is mainly about getting face-to-face time with the in-house book scouts at the studios, freelance book scouts and producers. It is often a busy time on the publishing side so I get to learn about what’s coming down the pipeline.”

	With the TV slowdown in mind, sources predict the pendulum may swing back to the big screen when it comes to options. Hannah Griffiths, Banijay’s Head of Adaptations, says the industry may channel the 1990s when “speculative” film options for books of yesteryear were much more in vogue. She points to the success of Edward Berger’s Oscar winner Conclave, which was based on a Robert Harris book from nearly a decade ago, and she predicts recent hit novels like Booker Prize-winner Orbital, a high-concept offering that is set in space, may struggle in the optioning market.

	The big TV adaptations that have broken through in recent months, such as Sky and Peacock’s The Day of the Jackal, Netflix’s One Day and Disney+’s Rivals, are unlikely to be the sort of deals that will be struck at LBF, Griffiths adds.

	United Agents’ Thomas, who reps the likes of What it Feels Like for a Girl scribe Paris Lees, says LBF is a “good time to remind people of our backlist that may have fallen out of option,” adding: “Sometimes you can have another bite of the cherry in terms of this matchmaking.”

CAA books agent Yasmin McDonald strikes an optimistic tone, positing that “having IP at the heart of the project tends to be reassuring to broadcasters and financiers,” and adding: “If you’ve got prestige IP then it could attract big actors, writers and directors, and having those elements helps get something to screen more quickly. In a funny way, the constraints of the past couple of years allow IP to break through.”

	Helping the market along is a rise in translation deals in the weeks and months leading up to the LBF, McDonald and her colleague Michelle Kroes tell us. In an “historically unusual” move, they say plenty deals have been struck on the non-English translation side before a book is sold to an American publisher due to the growing appetite for non-English fare. “That is a good indicator of how buoyant the market is, and I think film and TV buyers are tracking what’s happening with that,” says McDonald.

Trends and buzz 

	“There isn’t a real ‘book of the fair’ right now,” says Claire Lundberg, owner and CEO of literary scouting agency CTL Scouting, who is keeping a close eye on what organically materializes during the market, where there are many breakout contenders. “There’s no Ministry of Time or Lessons in Chemistry this year.”

	There is buzz building around the likes of Five by Ilona Banister and Alan Opts Out by Courtney Maum, which are cited by sources as ones to watch. We also published a review of seven titles that come with strong credentials from the likes of The Night Agent scribe Matthew Quirk, This is Going to Hurt writer Kay and Oliver Bullough, whose books on money laundering have been agenda-setting.

	










	Several sources have pointed to Broken Toys, a book by British journalist and editor Marie-Claire Chappet that sits in the curious publishing subgenre of young adult novels set around elite Scottish universities. Set in 2008 and following two young women who form a complicated friendship to as they study and party through their uni years, it has drawn comparisons to Saltburn. UK agency Peters Fraser + Dunlop is billing it as “a sharp, searing campus novel; a Prep for the next generation, for those enraptured by Euphoria.”

	The Peters Fraser + Dunlop media rights agent representing the title at LBF, Rosie Gurtovoy, confirms there have been bids. “There’s been an amazing response, and we’ve had just over ten offers from the U.S. and UK, with streaming platforms backing bids,” she says.

	Perhaps the Scotland trend has something to do with St Andrews University, where Prince William met and began his relationship with Catherine, Princess of Wales (then simply Kate Middleton), which was portrayed in The Crown. “Broken Toys is brilliantly adaptable, with a great ensemble cast,” says Gurtovoy. “It’s witty and racy with lots of emotion, centering on the British university experience. It’s a novel slightly younger readers can aspire to and older readers will feel nostalgic for, and that’s what’s interesting for TV: Streamers and producers want this type story after One Day and Normal People.”

	Not only that, but Gurtovoy notes its open-ended conclusion leaves a second season possible, which plays into the need for returnable stories. Many of the books that have broken through as TV shows in recent years have been limited series, but these are considered more and more risky in today’s complicated economic climate. A number of the people with spoke with for this article note how key returnability has become to getting projects off the page and into production. Lundberg, who started out working for Scott Rudin and ran MGM’s New York lit office before launching her consultancy, notes how things are coming full circle – or almost.

	“When I started, I was doing feature scouting primarily as television was very focused on syndication, and it is quite hard to get to 100 episodes,” she recalls. “Once that broke down, many books that are great limited series came through. That financial model doesn’t really work now, and people just want more episodes. It’s not 100 episodes anymore, but it is not limited series.”

	She says the current sweet spot is finding books that can provide around three seasons of roughly 35 episodes. These often need an “engine” such as a family business or a crime syndicate at their core to allow producers to build out characters and plots while staying close to the main themes.

	With this in mind, United Agents’ Thomas says she has clocked an “uptick” in children’s books being optioned and made into animated projects, which can be scaled up to series of around the 20 to 25 episode mark for networks like CBeebies or Sky Kids. “These are interesting deals,” she says. “What’s nice for our clients is a lot of them are both writers and illustrators, so they can be involved in a creative capacity with the shows.”

	Lundberg notes that the trends in book publishing and screen productions are diverging, as novel genres and themes move away from the lower-budget concepts TV buyers want right now such as procedurals. 

	










	“In books, there is real desire for escapism, which has most manifested in romantasy, and that is very expensive on TV,” she says. “I tend to think any time there is a huge trend like that, which is literally raising the bottom line of publishing houses, there will be appetite, but this is coming at a time when the pendulum is tipping toward economic prudence and you don’t think about that when you’re writing a novel.”

	Indeed, romantasy – a subgenre of romance and fantasy – has been a huge driver in book sales, but has not mirrored that success on screen. Hulu recently scrapped a long-gestating adaptation of Sarah J. Maas’s A Court of Thorns, in which a young adult huntress is transported to a magical land after killing a wolf, and Lundberg says TV execs are broadly looking at lower-budget, “grounded romance, which is easier for adaptation.”

	There is life in the genre, though. We hear Prime Video’s adaptation of Rebecca Yarros’ Fourth Wing, which is set in a brutal magical war college, where students either graduate or die, is moving ahead, and there are whispers that Netflix has quietly been building a romantasy slate that should begin materializing this year.

	Also popular in publishing is ‘dark academia’, a broad publishing subgenre that has at least in part inspired the themes and/or aesthetics of shows such as The Umbrella Academy, Wednesday, The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina and A Discovery of Witches. Going further back, think movies including The Dead Poets Society, Cruel Intentions and Kill Your Darlings. Like Broken Toys, lots of these novels are set in Ivy League or British redbrick universities (or fictionalized versions of them).

Big agencies out in full force

	Whether there is some business, slow business or no business, TV and film agents from both sides of the Atlantic will be out in force among the 25,000+ likely to attend the LBF. In recent years, Griffiths reckons there has been a “massive uptick in TV and film people” journeying to the Olympia in Hammersmith, coupled with a slight dip in more traditional faces from the publishing world.

	“Execs, scouts and producers will fly in from all over the world,” adds Peters Fraser + Dunlop’s Gurtovoy. “They feel a book adaptation is a surer thing in a risk-averse market.”

	CAA, WME and UTA along with its UK outfit Curtis Brown all occupy mega stands and their mid-week parties are some of the hottest tickets in town. “Based on the guestlist for UTA and Curtis Brown’s party, the number is definitely up,” says UTA’s Richman. “In all seriousness, we’re expecting a busy year across the board with many producers and executives who hadn’t been in attendance in previous years making the trek over to London.”

	Most attendees are here to network and meet people from the book world. In recent years, Banijay’s Griffiths says LBF has become more about networking and less about publishers signing big deals on the dotted line, which mirrors what has happened to traditional TV markets like MIPCOM.

	“Traditional agents would say they don’t wait for LBF anymore,” she adds. “The business carries on through the year. Every month has the same amount of submissions whereas before the market was focused on the Frankfurt Book Fair in October and London in March.”

	CAA’s McDonald, who says the agency has more than 110 greenlit films, TV shows and plays based on books in the last three years, agrees, noting that LBF is now “more about relationships, getting the word out there and having that diaolgue through the year so people are aware what’s coming.”

	










	However the business is getting done, Richman notes there is, and always will be, business to do. “Undoubtably buyers are being cautious and selective, but we’re finding if they love a book, they’re going all in for it,” he says.

	In a troubled political and economic climate that has made escaping into a good book perhaps more pleasurable than ever, it will be fascinating to see how the coming days play out.

92,2025-03-10,"New Tesla sales are tanking, leaving used bargains in their wake

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Whatever your political persuasion, it's hard to get away from the fact that Tesla is having a rough time at the moment, with new car sales plummeting by up to 76.6% in some markets over recent months.
According to CarScoops, Tesla sales in Norway dropped by 44.4% through January and February, meanwhile in Germany, where Musk’s now infamous salute arguably hit the hardest, sales were down a staggering 76.3% in February compared to the same period in 2024.
The picture looks even gloomier when you consider that in both the Norwegian and German markets, overall EV adoption has steadily been on the rise, with sales in Germany climbing 30.8% in February, and Norway’s EV market growing by 53.4% since the beginning of the year.
Tesla diehards will be keen to point out that the updated Model Y likely has something to do with it, as customers put off buying new and wait for that car to arrive in key markets, such as China, Australia and much of mainland Europe in the coming weeks.
Whether or not it's down to a general waning of consumer demand for Tesla products, or customers holding off for refreshed product, it’s hard to ignore the fact that these price crashes are also happening across the used market, too.
According to Forbes, the average price for a used Model Y in the US has dropped by more than $6,000 over the last 12 months to about $30,000 this month, according to data it received from used car experts CarGurus.
The same thing is happening to older, higher-mileage Model 3s, which Forbes says can now be picked up for less than $15,000, making them a veritable used bargain for first-time EV buyers.

But the anti-Tesla sentiment that is rife in the US right now could well see stock lingering on used-car forecourts for longer, as buyers actively choose to move away from the brand.
In the US, some Tesla owners have even resorted to sticking rival automotive badges onto their vehicles in an effort to disguise them.
This behavior is contagious, and is impacting the overall demand for Musk’s product, with web searches for Tesla vehicles dropping 7% this February, compared to the same period last year, while searches for other used EVs spiked 28%, according to Davide Greene, an industry analyst who spoke to Forbes.

With continuing threats of demonstrations and even violent actions at Tesla dealerships, the outlook for the brand isn’t rosy right now. And to make matters worse, some big-name Tesla advocates are turning their backs on Tesla.
Recently, Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak went on record to say that Tesla is “the worst in the world” when it comes to user interface, citing the fact that constant updates to the infotainment system have made it a “miserable” experience, according to Fortune.
Wozniak was an early advocate of Musk’s, praising the entrepreneur and publicly revealing his love for his Model S. Similarly, big-name celebrities, such as Sheryl Crow, have publicly waved goodbye to their Teslas in recent months.
One 2024 article by The Hollywood Reporter claimed that “Hollywood Can’t Ditch Its Teslas Fast Enough,” citing numerous industry experts that have seen demand for Musk’s electric vehicle plummet from an all-time high 10 years ago as it loses market share to Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and relative newcomers like Polestar.
However, some investors believe that the refreshed Model Y will see Tesla’s fortunes change, seeing as the model has historically accounted for a large proportion of the company’s overall sales.
This Reddit Post offers a rather more upbeat assessment of Telsa's fortunes compared to the pummeling the company is getting elsewhere in the press at the moment, but only time will tell if Elon’s brand damage has been permanent or not.
Leon has been navigating a world where automotive and tech collide for almost 20 years, reporting on everything from in-car entertainment to robotised manufacturing plants. Currently, EVs are the focus of his attentions, but give it a few years and it will be electric vertical take-off and landing craft. Outside of work hours, he can be found tinkering with distinctly analogue motorcycles, because electric motors are no replacement for an old Honda inline four.

93,2025-03-10,"Americans should come up with a totally new calendar to measure how long they’ll be affected under the president’s tariff plan, per the president.
During an interview with Fox Business’s Maria Bartiromo that aired Sunday, Donald Trump dodged whether the country would dive headlong into a recession, and suggested that Americans should model their economic projections on a 100-year model—like China—rather than assess his performance on a quarterly basis.
“Are you expecting a recession this year?” Bartiromo asked.
“I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we’re doing is very big,” Trump said.
Instead, Trump said, “There could be a little disruption.”
“Look, what I have to do is build a strong country,” the president continued, responding to criticism about the recent stock market drop. “You can’t really watch the stock market. If you look at China, they have a 100-year perspective. We have a quarter. We go by quarters. And you can’t go by that.”
Trump: ""There could be a little disruption. Look, what I have to do is build a strong country. You can't really watch the stock market. If you look at China, they have a 100 year perspective. We go by quarters. And you can't go by that."" pic.twitter.com/xv5hQGDvw7
Last month, Trump announced he would impose a 25 percent tariff on goods from America’s closest neighbors. Two days later, he backtracked, giving Canada and Mexico a one-month delay. On March 4, the tariffs went into effect, sparking retaliatory tariffs from Canada, as well as outcry from America’s Big Three automakers. 
A couple more days later, Trump directed another one-month pause for goods that met his 2020 trade deal, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which a White House official told CNBC covered roughly 50 percent of Mexican imports and 38 percent of Canadian imports. And then, in an interview that aired Friday, Trump said the tariffs could go higher than 25 percent.
As a result, the last week saw drastic market fluctuations, with the stock market tumbling as the tariffs went into effect. The Dow dropped 670 points, and by the end of the week, Republican lawmakers were fed up.
“The tariffs could go up as time goes by, and they may go up,” Trump told Bartiromo. “We may go up with some tariffs. I don’t think we’ll go down, but we may go up.”
“For years, globalists have been ripping off the United States. They’ve been taking money away from the United States, and all we’re doing is getting some of it back, and we’re going to treat our country fairly,” Trump said, echoing language from one of his former key advisers, Steve Bannon. “This country has been ripped off from every nation in the world, every company in the world. We’ve been ripped off at levels never seen before, and what we’re going to do is get it back.”
Donald Trump wants Americans to “shut up” about the soaring price of eggs. 
Trump shared an article on Truth Social Saturday titled, “Shut Up About Egg Prices—Trump Is Saving Consumers Millions,” written by Charlie Kirk, the CEO of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA, which assisted the president during his campaign. 
The article posited that Democrats were “positively giddy about the price of eggs,” which reached $8 a dozen last week. While Democrats may long for “proof that these backward, ‘extreme’ MAGA Republicans didn’t know what they were voting for,” the high price of eggs was “in no way President Trump’s fault,” Kirk wrote.
Kirk echoed the right-wing claim that the high egg prices were the fault of the Biden administration, because it had killed way too many chickens in response to the bird flu outbreak—in reality, that’s an Agriculture Department policy that has continued during the first months of the Trump administration. 
Kirk also claimed that it didn’t matter if egg prices went up—though Trump seemed to think it did when trying to win votes on the campaign trail—because the Trump administration would save consumers money in other important ways, by cutting taxes on tips, overtime, and Social Security.
Trump has bragged about winning the election based solely on his promise to lower the price of groceries. Since claiming the presidency, though, Trump has plainly stated that he actually has no idea how to get consumer prices down. With the president’s endorsement, Kirk’s article reads like an admission. “I’m Sorry. I Can’t. Don’t Hate Me.” 
Trump’s unwieldy economic policy only makes that more clear. 
The president’s decision to enact steep tariffs on America’s closest trading partners, Canada, Mexico, and China, led to a major sell-off in the stock market last week and new forecasts predicting a recession on the horizon. Washington Post economic columnist Heather Long said on MSNBC that it was “hard to envision” prices coming down amid the ensuing trade war. 
Trump’s insistence that American consumers should keep quiet about their concerns is particularly disturbing when just last week, he seemed to soft-launch the idea that despite his promises to reverse inflation, the U.S. was headed toward another recession. Already, members of the Trump administration have been trying to sugarcoat the economic meltdown, calling it a “detox” or “transition” period.
In a post on Truth Social Sunday evening, Trump had a much different message.
 “We’re going to become so rich, you’re not gonna know where to spend all that money,” he wrote. “I’m telling you—just watch!”
Marco Rubio has put the final nail into the USAID coffin.
“After a 6 week review we are officially cancelling 83% of the programs at USAID,” Trump’s secretary of state wrote on X early Monday morning. “The 5200 contracts that are now cancelled spent tens of billions of dollars in ways that did not serve, (and in some cases even harmed), the core national interests of the United States.
“In consultation with Congress, we intend for the remaining 18% of programs we are keeping (approximately 1000) to now be administered more effectively under the State Department,” Rubio continued. “Thank you to DOGE and our hardworking staff who worked very long hours to achieve this overdue and historic reform.
“Tough, but necessary. Good working with you,” purger-in-chief Elon Musk commented under Rubio’s post. “The important parts of USAID should always have been with Dept of State.”
In reality, this isn’t about efficiency or savings—these are ideologically motivated cuts that will have devastating, deadly impacts throughout the world. Last week, Nicholas Elrich, a recently fired USAID official, noted that the cuts will lead to “12.5–17.9 million cases of malaria with an additional 71,000–166,000 deaths annually,” “a 28 to 32 percent increase in tuberculosis globally,” “an additional 200,000 paralytic polio cases a year,” and in a potential worst-case scenario, over “28,000 cases of Ebola, Marburg, or related diseases.” His sentiments were echoed across the political landscape.
“USAID’s own internal projections suggest hundreds of thousands of kids will die from malaria or malnutrition, or be disabled by polio as a result of this,” Mehdi Hasan wrote on X. “Shame on Rubio and Trump. Cruel and catastrophic beyond belief.”
“Huge mistake. We needed reform of USAID not dismantlement,” wrote Stanford professor Michael McFaul. “China is not ending is foreign assistance programs. In an age of great power competition, the Trump administration is unilaterally destroying one of our best instruments of soft power influence.”
“You sad, shitty human,” said Lincoln Project founder Rick Wilson. “You know the damage to America this will do in the world, but can’t resist the lure of power and Trump’s approval.”
The Trump administration detained a pro-Palestine activist Saturday night in a chilling assault on free speech.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a leader in the Columbia University protest movement, despite his being a green card holder. Initially, they told his lawyer, Amy Greer, that his student visa was being revoked, even though he didn’t have one. When ICE agents were informed over the phone by Greer that Khalil has a green card, they reportedly hung up the phone on her.
“On March 9, 2025, in support of President Trump’s executive orders prohibiting anti-Semitism, and in coordination with the Department of State, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student. Khalil led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization,” a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, Tricia McLaughlin, said.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio posted about Khalil’s arrest on X Sunday, adding, “We will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.”
It was unknown where Khalil was being held for days, but on Monday, the ICE locator finally showed him in the LaSalle Detention Facility in Louisiana. His wife is eight months pregnant and a U.S. citizen.
“ICE’s arrest and detention of Mahmoud follows the U.S. government’s open repression of student activism and political speech, specifically targeting students at Columbia University for criticism of Israel’s assault on Gaza,” Greer said. “The U.S. government has made clear that they will use immigration enforcement as a tool to suppress that speech.”
On Friday, the Trump administration announced that it was canceling $400 million in federal grants to Columbia over its “continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students,” a pointed reference to its pro-Palestine protest movement. Last week, Trump himself posted on Truth Social, “Federal Funding will STOP for any College, School, or University that allows illegal protests,” threatening to deport foreign students who take part in such protests.
Khalil’s detention appears both to follow up Trump’s threat against pro-Palestine protesters and to continue to make an example out of Columbia University, despite the institution’s crackdown on student activists. Legal challenges to this assault on the First Amendment are surely coming, but it remains to be seen if the legal system will reinforce the right to free speech or strengthen the Trump administration’s draconian efforts. 
Trump is soft-launching a recession. 
The president has now twice refused to rule out a recession in the wake of his own policies, including reckless tariff wars and massive cuts to the federal government. 
“Look I know that you inherited a mess,” Fox’s Maria Bartiromo asked him on Sunday Morning Futures. “But are you expecting a recession this year?”
“I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big. We’re bringing wealth back to America, that’s a big thing. And there are always periods of.… It takes a little time, it takes a little time. But I think it should be great for us,” Trump responded, completely avoiding the question.
“A lot of people said ‘Oh, this is the business president,’” Bartiromo continued. “And now we have tariffs and the market has been going down.”
“Well not much, in all fairness.”
“You said ‘Look, we’re gonna have disruption but we’re OK with that.’ Is that what you meant; the stock market going down was the disruption?” 
“Look what I have to do is build a strong country. You can’t really watch the stock market.… What we’re doing is we’re building a tremendous foundation for the future.”
Bartiromo pressed even further. “The public companies wanna make sure that we have clarity. After April 2, when those reciprocal tariffs go in, is that it? Are you gonna change anything after that? Will we have clarity?”
“You’ll have a lot. But we may go up with some tariffs, it depends. We may go up, I don’t think we’ll go down, but we may go up. They have plenty of clarity.… They always say that,” Trump said.  
Trump continued this economic dismissiveness later that same day. 
“Are you worried about a recession?” a reporter asked him on Air Force One Sunday evening. “Maria Bartiromo asked you, and you kind of hesitated.”
The president shrugged. “I’ll tell you what, of course you hesitate. All I know is this: We’re gonna take in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs and we’re gonna become so rich you’re not gonna know where to spend all that money, I’m telling you, you just watch! We’re gonna have jobs, we’re gonna have factories, it’s gonna be great.” 
The businesses and farmers Trump claims to be doing this for might not survive the incoming recession that these tariffs—10 percent on China for now, with tariffs on Canada and Mexico to be determined later—will surely bring. It’s obvious now that Trump couldn’t care less about the American people’s economic suffering as long as it serves his spiteful political goals of sticking it to our allies and kneecapping the federal government.
While speaking to the press in the Oval Office Friday, Donald Trump got upset when a reporter asked him about “clashes” between Elon Musk and members of his Cabinet, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, during a Thursday meeting.  
“No clash, I was there. You’re just a troublemaker, and you’re not supposed to be asking that question because we’re talking about the World Cup,” Trump replied, referring to an executive he had just signed to prepare for the 2026 games. “Elon gets along great with Marco, and they’re both doing a fantastic job. There is no clash.” 
When the reporter tried to follow up, Trump asked him, “Who are you with?” The reporter replied, “NBC,” to which Trump said, “No wonder. That’s enough. NBC.”  
""You're not supposed to be asking that question ... that's enough"" -- Trump gets mad at and shuts down a reporter who tries to ask him about reported clashes between Musk and Rubio pic.twitter.com/yZtzwAZ426
In the Cabinet meeting, Musk had reportedly complained that Rubio hadn’t fired anyone from the State Department, despite recommendations from Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, according to The New York Times. Rubio fired back at Musk, noting that 1,500 officials had taken the government’s deferred resignation “buyout” program. Trump finally stepped in to defend Rubio, saying he was doing a “great job.”
Musk also reportedly argued with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy over the purge of federal workers, with Duffy complaining that Musk tried to fire air traffic controllers. Musk accused Duffy of lying, and the two argued, with Musk claiming that air traffic control towers were staffed with so-called DEI hires. The Times reported that Trump ended the argument by saying that Duffy should hire air traffic controllers who were “geniuses” from MIT.
Trump has long had a contentious relationship with the press, and in his second term, has sought to take action against media outlets he doesn’t like, taking over control of the press pool that covers the White House from the White House Correspondents’ Association and shutting out the Associated Press for not adopting his name change of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. Who knows if he’ll now punish NBC for simply asking questions. 
Republicans have censured Representative Al Green and petitioned to strip him of his committee assignments for interrupting Donald Trump’s speech to Congress. But by Friday, Representative Lauren Boebert had decided to sling some mud on the situation for good measure.
“For him to go and shake his pimp cane at President Trump was absolutely abhorrent,” Boebert, who was caught on surveillance footage fondling her date during a showing of Beetlejuice in 2023, told Real America’s Voice.
Boebert was referring to the 77-year-old Texas Democrat’s walking cane.
When Trump claimed during his Tuesday night speech that he had been given a “mandate” by the American people to radically reimagine the federal government, Green interrupted the president by yelling, “You have no mandate to cut Medicaid!”
That got Green ousted by House Speaker Mike Johnson, who called on the sergeant of arms to remove the 77-year-old from the chamber against a backdrop of jeers from Republicans.
“I did it from my heart, and I will suffer whatever the consequences are,” Green told reporters the next day. “But truthfully, I would do it again.”
Senate Republicans are working to pass a budget that even party members have recently admitted will result in a $880 billion cut to Medicaid, much to the chagrin of their own constituents. The multibillion-dollar cut is a trade-off for conservatives who were tasked by Donald Trump to extend his 2017 tax plan, which will overwhelmingly benefit corporations and is projected to add as much as $15 trillion to the national deficit.
Green’s protest was practically the only noticeable rejection of Trump’s agenda that Democrats could muster Tuesday night. Other liberal lawmakers were torched for flipping paddles that read “False,” “Musk Steals,” and “Save Medicaid” in a silent protest in the face of the administration’s apparent oligarchy and its systemic dismantling of the federal government.
And viewers watching live at home would never have known that a handful of Democrats stood up and walked out of the chamber in protest, as TV cameras never bothered to pan to their mute, “dignified” spectacle. Others, such as Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Patty Murray, opted to not show up at all.
Donald Trump is continuing to crack down on free speech by threatening to revoke a program that forgives the student loans of federal and non-profit employees, teachers, police, and pastors, among others. 
Trump signed an executive order Friday barring individuals who engaged in “improper” activities from receiving relief under the government’s Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, a Bush-era policy that cancels student loans after 10 years of payments. 
This move is clearly intended to have a chilling effect on the work of non-profits, which operate in some of the policy spaces most affected by Trump’s agenda, such as immigration. Under Trump’s order, loan forgiveness could be stripped away from individuals who provide legal support, advocacy, or education work on behalf of undocumented immigrants. 
In addition to targeting work on illegal immigration, the White House said that the order would exclude individuals whose work had been tied to foreign terrorist groups. This is a clear sign they intend to continue cracking down on pro-Palestinian advocacy and activism. 
The Trump administration previously threatened to revoke federal funding from any schools that allow large protests, and on Thursday announced it would cancel $400 million in grants to Columbia University for “inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.” Meanwhile, earlier this week, the university once again sicced police officers on its own peaceful student protesters, and has begun investigating students over speech critical of Israel. 
As of December, more than two million Americans had eligible employment and open student loans, according to the Associated Press. While only a small percentage of claims are eligible for relief through PSLF, the work of hundreds of groups may be affected by Trump’s order. 
Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, wrote on X Friday that Trump’s order was “shockingly unlawful and a clear First Amendment violation.”
“The PSLF program provides the president no authority to restrict it to only those people who work for nonprofits whose work he supports,” Reichlin-Melnick wrote. “Expect lawsuits within short periods of time.”
DropSite News’s Ryan Grim sarcastically quipped that he’d heard from the Supreme Court that “the president can’t change the terms of student loans,” a dig at the high court blocking President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness efforts.
The Trump administration is canceling $400 million in grants to Columbia University over what it says is “the school’s continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.”
In reality, the president is clamping down on pro-Palestine protests that began in late 2023, when Israel responded to Hamas’s attack on the country with a brutal military campaign that human rights organizations have called genocide. Columbia had some of the highest profile protests of any American college campus at the time, setting up an encampment and briefly occupying a university building. 
On Thursday, the administration’s Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism, made up of staffers from the Justice Department, Health and Human Services Department, Education Department, and the General Services Administration, told Columbia that it would soon be conducting a “comprehensive review” of their federal grants and contracts. That review seems to have taken all of one day. 
In a statement, Education Secretary Linda McMahon implied that Columbia did not comply with federal laws against discrimination. 
“Since October 7, Jewish students have faced relentless violence, intimidation, and anti-Semitic harassment on their campuses — only to be ignored by those who are supposed to protect them,” the statement read. “Universities must comply with all federal antidiscrimination laws if they are going to receive federal funding. For too long, Columbia has abandoned that obligation to Jewish students studying on its campus. Today, we demonstrate to Columbia and other universities that we will not tolerate their appalling inaction any longer.”
Left out of the statement was the fact that the university is facing a lawsuit from three students alleging civil rights violations, breach of contract, negligence, unlawful eviction, and other Title VI violations over Columbia’s harsh crackdown on pro-Palestine student protesters. 
In recent months, the university’s new disciplinary committee, the Office of Institutional Equity, has brought several cases of discriminatory harassment against students who expressed criticism of Israel. “Infractions” include writing an op-ed in the student newspaper calling for divestment from Israel, sharing social media posts supporting the Palestinian people, or joining “unauthorized protests.” 
These actions appear to have been for naught in the eyes of the Trump administration, which appears to be trying to make an example out of Columbia and suppress criticism of Israel and support for Palestine. Trump is fulfilling a threat he made on Tuesday, when he said in a Truth Social post that “All Federal Funding will STOP for any College, School, or University that allows illegal protests” and threatened to deport foreign students who take part in such protests. 
The notion of “illegal protests,” particularly in places like colleges and universities which have a long legacy of protesting going back decades, seems to be a massive violation of the Constitution and the First Amendment, and contradicts Trump’s own claim that he “stopped all government censorship and brought back free speech in America.” But Trump has never been consistent on any principles, and seeks to punish anyone who goes against his views. 
Donald Trump is desperately trying to solve the country’s egg crisis, and failing.
Amid a record-breaking outbreak of avian flu that’s decimated egg production across the country, the cost of eggs has skyrocketed. Nationwide, a dozen eggs sold for $4.95 on average in January, up from $2.52 last year.
Trump’s solution? To import 70 million–100 million perishable and fragile eggs from other countries within the next month. The plan is as foolproof as it sounds. With a short shelf life, strict trade requirements for animal products, and countries abroad experiencing their own egg shortages due to bird flu, Trump is realizing that importing eggs isn’t easy.
Despite the rise in demand from the United States, there aren’t enough eggs to ship; just 3 percent of the world’s egg supply enters global trade.
“It’s a very local industry. If you want to rebalance the market, you need big volumes. It’s almost impossible, in the short term, to do that,” animal protein expert Nan-Dirk Mulder told Bloomberg.
Some of the world’s top egg-exporting countries have received egg-import requests from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Bloomberg reported.
But Poland faces health certification barriers for selling eggs in U.S. retail stores. Last month, the U.S. pulled import licenses for eggs from the Netherlands—the world’s top egg exporter—due to industry practice concerns, but Trump plans to reinstate the license in a desperate bid to get Americans their eggs.
As usual, the president and his cronies are blaming Democrats, not the disease that’s killed more than 166 million commercial birds and devastated farms across the country.
“This shows the price of eggs over the last 40 years,” Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said in an interview with Fox News, while pointing to a graph. “As you can see, the price was pretty static for 40 years, 50 years actually, and then all of a sudden under Obama it went up a little bit, Trump went down, and then Biden it has skyrocketed.”
Amid the excuses, consumers, retailers, and farmers continue to pay the price."

U.S. stocks cratered Monday amid growing U.S. economic concerns and after President Trump declined to rule out a recession that investors worry could be triggered by his aggressive trade policies.
Asian and European markets were mixed Tuesday.
But U.S. shares were somewhat higher in futures trading, according to Bloomberg.
After falling more than 1,000 points in afternoon trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended at 41,912, down 890 points, or 2.1%. 
The president's trade war with China heated up on Monday as Beijing began implementing retaliatory tariffs on a range of American farm products for which China is the largest market. That includes a 15% levy on U.S. chicken, wheat and corn, as well as a 10% tax on soybeans, pork, beef and fruit. 
Ontario, Canada's most populous province, on Monday also said it is adding a 25% surcharge to all electricity exports sent to the U.S. as part of that nation's response to the White House's tariffs on Canadian products. 
""Stocks are back in the red as psychology deteriorates further and investors continue to aggressively de-risk,"" Adam Crisafulli, a market analyst at Vital Knowledge, wrote in a midday update. ""The drivers of the weakness are the same that have been weighing on sentiment since the middle of February: concerns about slowing growth, a destructive pro-tariff agenda by Trump (coupled with a high economic/financial pain threshold among White House officials), and elevated valuations."" 
The S&P 500 slid 2.7%, or 187 points, to 5,615, its worst day of the year. The S&P shed 3.1% last week, its worst weekly performance since September. 
The tech-heavy Nasdaq was hit even harder, falling 728 points, or 4%, after entering a correction last week. Tesla shares plummeted more than 15%, and Alphabet, Apple and Nvidia each lost about 5%. 
Wall Street's losses come a day after Mr. Trump declined to state whether he expects a recession this year, with the president telling Fox News in an interview broadcast on Sunday that ""I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big."" That said, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday that there is no reason to ready for a recession. 
Goldman Sachs on Monday said it was downgrading its economic growth forecast for 2025, previously 2.4%, to 1.7%, citing the stronger headwinds resulting from the Trump administration's trade policies.
""We now see the average U.S. tariff rate rising by 10 [percentage points] this year, twice our previous forecast and about five times the increase seen in the first Trump administration,"" Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman, in a note to investors.
The Trump administration last week imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico before pausing the levy days later for goods covered under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement. 
The White House is sticking with its stance that tax cuts and tariff revenue ahead will bolster the economy, which is hitting investor sentiment, with last week marking the largest market rout since Mr. Trump was re-elected four months ago. 
The S&P 500 continued its fall from a record high in February, with strategists cautioning of ongoing stock volatility amid uncertainty about U.S. trade policy, tariffs and inflation. Some economists believe inflation is likely to rise this year, with economists at Morgan Stanley Research and Goldman Sachs recently hiking forecasts.
""The risks of higher inflation as a result of a broader tariff war have taken a back seat in the overall market view recently, as the risks of slower economic growth have shifted to the forefront,"" stated John Canavan, lead U.S. analyst at Oxford Economics. 
The White House agency of cutting taxes and regulation is geared toward bringing manufacturing and jobs back to the U.S., but the ultimate outcome of Mr. Trump's policies is far from clear. 
""Many investors support the president's pro-growth business agenda, but the administration's frenetic approach to policymaking is unsettling,"" according to Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.
