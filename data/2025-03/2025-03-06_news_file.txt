0,2025-03-06,"Say what you will about the Department of Government Efficiency, but there are some ways that the Trump administration has significantly cut down on bloat. For example, it used to take at least a little digging to identify if a President was favor-trading and self-dealing. Now it seems like it just happens out in the open. So streamlined!
To that end, cryptocurrency analysis platform Nansen AI reported that World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance protocol that is operated primarily by President Trump’s three sons, purchased $25 million in cryptocurrencies including $10 million in Ethereum, $10 million in Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), and $1.5 million in of MOVE. That move comes just one day before President Trump will host the White House Crypto Summit on Friday. The company also announced Thursday that it was entering a “strategic reserve deal” with layer-1 blockchain project SUI, which caused a significant uptick in the value of the coin.
Now, to be fair, it doesn’t exactly take a genius to place a bet that the cryptocurrency market might spike in response to the hype generated by the White House Crypto Summitâjust like when Trump announced a “Crypto Strategic Reserve,” it resulted in prices spiking. The crypto market, if nothing else, is extremely predictable in that it will react to hype.
But also, Trump’s kids run the company, and World Liberty Financial co-founder Zach Witkoff (the son of billionaire Trump buddy Steve Witkoff) is one of the “industry leaders” invited to the summit. And that’s a whole lot of posturing to be doing right before an event that will almost certainly generate a bunch of hype, if not actual policy announcements that could cause the crypto market to surge again.
And it’d be silly to ignore the fact that World Liberty Financial has at least seemingly served as a platform for currying favor with the President via lining his kids’ pockets.
Justin Sun, a Chinese national and founder of the cryptocurrency TRON, was sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission in 2023 for allegedly committing fraud and manipulating the price of his cryptocurrency. The SEC asked for a stay in the case shortly after Sun purchased $75 million worth of tokens from World Liberty Financial and joined the company as an advisor. Convenient!Â  Earlier this year, Reuters reported that several people who bought significant holdings of World Liberty tokens said a primary appeal was having a connection with Trump. Interesting! Also, World Liberty Financial is set up in such a way that the Trump family can lay claim to 75% of the net revenue. Very normal!
People have rightfully skewered Nancy Pelosi for her incredibly successful stock trading history, to the point where you can now ride the coattails of her trades that tend to overperform the market. It might be time to start doing the same thing by watching the crypto activity of World Liberty Financial. They sure seem to know something.

2,2025-03-06,"‘It is inaccurate that $549/$599 MSRP is launch-only pricing,’ AMD tells The Verge.
‘It is inaccurate that $549/$599 MSRP is launch-only pricing,’ AMD tells The Verge.
by  Sean Hollister
Yesterday, reviewers agreed: AMD is finally beating Nvidia with its RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT graphics cards, assuming they actually launch with sufficient stock at their $549 and $599 prices.
But this morning’s launch, while better than recent Nvidia launches in terms of supply, may not have met that bar — and AMD would not deny reports that even the best-priced models of these GPUs are capped to specific quantities, after which they may be sold at higher than $549 or $599.
When The Verge checked this morning, major US retailers Best Buy and Newegg listed as few as a single model of each GPU at their MSRP, which sold out quickly, of course. Most cards are listed for a $100 premium over that MSRP, if not more.
Micro Center appears to be doing far better, with as many as five 9070s and five 9070 XTs at MSRP and a website that claims they’re even still available for purchase if you visit one of its 28 US locations in person.
What happens next? It’s not unusual for each graphics card partner to sell a variety of fancier grades of the same GPU at higher prices with fancier cooling and overclocking — but retailers are now suggesting that even the prices of entry-level cards won’t hold.
“We have now learned how the recommended prices, also known as MSRP prices, work for the launch of the AMD Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT […] they will apply to a limited number of cards,” wrote Swedish retailer Inet.se, as documented by VideoCardz.
“MSRP is capped quantity of a few hundred, so prices will jump once those are sold through,” UK retailer Overclockers UK also reportedly wrote.
Even Best Buy seemed to suggest that $549 / $599 prices were only temporary. When we visited this morning, the Best Buy website described them like they were on sale, though the company has since removed the “save $80” and “save $130” you see below. AMD says the Best Buy listings were an error.
We asked AMD:
AMD would not confirm or deny. It did address the larger question of MSRP availability with this statement from chief gaming solutions architect (and gaming marketing boss) Frank Azor, though:
It is inaccurate that $549 / $599 MSRP is launch-only pricing. We expect cards to be available from multiple vendors at $549 / $599 (excluding region specific tariffs and / or taxes) based on the work we have done with our AIB partners, and more are coming. At the same time, the AIBs have different premium configurations at higher price points and those will also continue.
On X, Azor tweeted that AMD is working to replenish stock “in the coming days and weeks,” adding, “MSRP pricing (excluding region specific tariffs and/or taxes) will continue to be encouraged beyond today so don’t despair.”
Update, 4:30PM ET: Added that AMD says the Best Buy listings were in error.

3,2025-03-06,"
    We gave up a 2.75% mortgage rate on our former property, but we have no regrets.
  
My husband and I had put off buying our ""forever home"" for some time, holding onto our smallish condo with the rock-bottom 2.75% mortgage rate we scored during the pandemic. Over the last few years, we've watched supply remain stagnant while property values continue their steady upward march. 
You've probably noticed that home prices rise over time. Sometimes the cost of housing skyrockets during economic booms or dips during downturns, but generally, home prices go up a few percentage points a year. 
So when we found a single-family house exactly where we wanted to be in Massachusetts, we knew we had to jump on it. 
I won't lie. We love our new home, but we're dealing with sticker shock. Even though we can probably refinance in the future, it was painful to give up our relatively cheap monthly payments just to get ahead of the competition.
Our situation isn't unique. Tons of homebuyers are locked out of a challenging housing market due to tighter inventory, high prices and costly interest rates. Some of us feel the only way to adapt is to lock in a manageable housing payment before things get even more financially difficult. Here's why we took the plunge. 
Read more: This Real Estate Expert Says Home Prices Are Never Going Down
My family lives in a historic coastal town just north of Boston, known for its charm and stability. Because it's relatively affordable compared to Boston, it's also highly desirable among prospective homebuyers.
The increased competition for a smaller supply of available homes has pushed up costs. Listing prices increased by about 50% between 2020 and 2024, according to Redfin data, with homes receiving multiple offers and selling within a few weeks.
""It's one of the more sought-after communities where we've seen the market take off and flourish,"" said Bob Driscoll, director of residential lending at Rockland Trust.
This scenario is playing out across the US in multiple markets, where homeowners are staying put and refusing to give up their 3% rates. So even if you're lucky enough to find a home for sale, get preapproved and feel comfortable with the mortgage rate, ""you still have to deal with the extraordinary competition,"" Driscoll said.
When we started property shopping, I closely studied the local market. I knew prices were dropping a bit because sellers were overpricing their homes. We kept an eye on single-family houses in the area and noticed one beautiful property with a notable price drop.
The value of the condo we bought in 2020 was strong. After doing the calculations, we knew we could sell it and have enough to put 20% down on the house and cover the closing costs. This strategy allowed us to buy our dream house with a realistic mortgage payment.
Saying goodbye to our 2.75% interest rate was a hard pill to swallow, especially because those low rates are likely never to return. Homebuyers must accept that reality.
After using several popular methods to lower our rate, we ended up with 6.49% this time around. One of those methods was a temporary 2-1 buydown, meaning our payments are based on a lower rate for the first two years of the loan. We paid for the buydown using the proceeds from our condo sale.
This strategy doesn't save us money, but it provides a forced savings account and a two-year ramp-up period during which we adjust to a higher mortgage payment. Our lender is offering a no-cost refinance that we can use whenever rates drop.
If I could redo our transaction, I would probably buy discount points for a permanent buydown instead of a temporary buydown. That's because mortgage rates aren't dropping as experts predicted they would.
""I would say rates will stabilize and sit somewhere in the 6% range in 2025,"" Driscoll said. ""We are not predicting any sort of massive rate drop.""
Before making an offer on our new home, I did some research to calculate how our expenses and budget would change. The information helped me determine whether we could actually afford to live in our new house. (We could!)
Here are a few line items I planned for.
After the offer was accepted, we ordered a home inspection, which also helped us budget for future maintenance costs.
It's challenging to buy a home right now. Prices are high, and so are mortgage rates. But it's still worth evaluating if it's the right decision for you.
Certain steps can assist you through the process. Getting a preapproval, for instance, can help you create a housing budget. This step also strengthens your position in a competitive market because the seller knows you already have a lender onboard.
Consider what you feel comfortable paying each month, and try not to focus too much on the mortgage rate.
""If you love the home, you can afford it and you qualify for it, deal with the rate,"" Driscoll said. ""You have control of that as time progresses."""
4,2025-03-06,Investors got what they wanted on Wednesday — temporary tariff relief from the Trump administration that finally halted a two-day selloff that sent the stock market into a tailspin earlier this week.
5,2025-03-06,"On Wednesday, in a series of high-stakes diplomatic episodes around the globe, Trump's free-wheeling attitude toward foreign policy was on full display, playing out in real time through posts on his Truth Social account.
For his supporters, it was the president's ""art of the deal"" in action, using every negotiating tool and tactic at his disposal.
For critics, it was another day of disruption for its own sake – with little apparent concern for the risks involved or the potential consequences.
Wednesday began with news that the US is directly negotiating with Hamas leaders for the release of American hostages still in Gaza. Contacting a group designated a foreign terrorist organisation by the US since 1997 represents a dramatic shift away from decades of US policy.
The Biden administration relied on intermediaries during its attempts to end the Gaza war. And Trump previously condemned Hamas for committing ""atrocities against humanity"" during its 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, calling its members ""vicious and violent"".
But for Trump, it seems, the old playbook wasn't working – and he was willing to risk appearing hypocritical, of bypassing US ally Israel, and of sitting down with a designated terror group to advance his deal-making goals.
Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office responded with a terse statement, saying only that it had ""expressed its position"" on the talks.
By the end of the day, after meeting in the Oval Office with some previously released American hostages, Trump again turned up the heat on the group. He took to Truth Social to call it ""sick and twisted"" and issue a ""last warning"" that if members didn't release all the hostages there would be ""hell to pay"".
""I am sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job,"" he wrote, ""not a single Hamas member will be safe if you don't do as I say.""
Laura Blumenfeld, a former senior Israeli-Palestinian policy adviser to the US state department, told the BBC that Trump's message to Hamas was an ultimatum.
""The deal, though, with these ultimatums is you have to deliver,"" she said, ""and we saw last month when Trump said you've got a high noon deadline on Saturday, release the hostages, or else, there was no or else.
""And Hamas called them out. They said, President Trump, your threats have no meaning.""
Press secretary Karoline Leavitt had earlier placed the president's dramatic changes of course into the context of Trump's larger foreign policy, telling reporters that ""dialogue and talking to people around the world"" is a part of his ""good faith effort to do what's right for the American people"".
The White House has employed similar logic to Trump's recent efforts to thaw US relations with Moscow, including dispatching high-level administration officials to Saudi Arabia to meet directly with a Russian delegation.
That dramatic diplomatic about-face accompanied sharp criticism of Ukraine and its President, Volodymyr Zelensky, which culminated in Friday's heated meeting in the Oval Office. An announcement followed this week saying that the US had suspended arms shipments, and another on Wednesday said intelligence-sharing with the war-torn nation was paused.
Trump's actions left America's European allies rattled – and the consequences of that may not yet be fully appreciated. But his efforts to exploit Ukraine's pressure point – withholding aid and information - appear to have produced the intended result. 
Zelensky on Tuesday sent a conciliatory letter to Trump proposing a limited ceasefire, and US and Ukrainian officials resumed talks on Wednesday about a mineral deal to compensate America for aid expenditures.
If Trump's goal is to encourage Ukraine and Russia to enter peace talks, he has effectively brought Zelensky to heel, even as it remains unclear what concessions he is asking Russian President Vladimir Putin to make during those negotiations.
Sometimes, even with Trump, the pressure points go in the other direction.
A month ago, he announced sweeping new tariffs on Canada and Mexico, only to back away from them at the last moment. This week he allowed those 25% levies to go into effect – at least for a day.
After two days of sharp declines in the US stock market, the White House appeared to dial back the severity of these tariffs somewhat, announcing that it was granting a one-month exemption for automobiles imported from Canada and Mexico.
US car manufacturers warned that the new tariffs could devastate the industry, leading to plant closings within a matter of weeks.
Trump spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday, and offered his own readout – via Truth Social – on what he said was a ""somewhat friendly"" call, even as he accused the ""governor"" of Canada of using the trade issue to ""stay in power"".
While Zelensky quickly backed down under White House pressure and the Hamas talks are only beginning, Trudeau and the Canadians, for their part, appear to be settling in for a longer fight.
Trump's convention-breaking playbook may be shaking things up this week, but it's far from clear if they will deliver the kind of wins he wants.

6,2025-03-06,"Tariffs issued this week upended U.S. trade relationships and roiled markets.
Sweeping tariffs issued by President Donald Trump this week upended relations with top U.S. trading partners, roiled the stock market and stoked diplomatic tensions.
The Trump administration slapped 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, as well as 10% tariffs on imports from China. The fresh round of duties on Chinese goods doubled an initial set of tariffs placed on China last month.
A day later, Trump issued a one-month delay for tariffs on auto-related goods from Mexico and Canada. The carve-out expanded soon afterward with an additional one-month pause for goods from Mexico and Canada compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, a free trade agreement.
The tariffs reprised -- and, in some ways, escalated -- a policy approach pursued during Trump's first term in office.
Below is a timeline of Trump's recent effort to impose far-reaching tariffs, and what has happened since they took effect.
Oct. 15, 2024 – In an appearance at the Economic Club of Chicago, then-presidential nominee Donald Trump voiced enthusiasm for tariffs. ""To me, the most beautiful word in the dictionary is 'tariff,'"" Trump said. The comments exemplified the fervor with which Trump backed tariffs during the 2024 presidential campaign.
Nov. 25, 2024 – Less than three weeks after his election victory, Trump announced on Truth Social plans to place 25% tariffs on all imports from Canada and Mexico, citing an alleged failure to secure their respective borders with the U.S. Trump also said he would put 10% tariffs on goods from China, calling on the country to stop production of illegal fentanyl bound for the U.S.
Jan. 20 – Trump signed a memo calling on Cabinet members to ""assess the unlawful migration and fentanyl flows"" from Canada, Mexico and China. Afterward, officials should ""recommend appropriate trade and national security measures to resolve that emergency,"" the memo said.
Feb. 1 – Trump ordered 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, as well as 10% tariffs on imports from China. The White House said the tariffs would take effect on Feb. 4.
Feb. 3 – Trump announced a one-month pause of tariffs on Canada and Mexico after reaching agreements with each country that included commitments to bolster border enforcement.
Feb. 4 – The U.S. imposed 10% tariffs on goods from China.
Feb. 27 – Trump affirmed plans to impose 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico when the one-month delay expires on March 4. He also announced that an additional 10% tariff on goods from China will also take effect the same day.
March 3 – Speaking at the White House, Trump reiterated plans to move forward with a fresh round of tariffs the following day. Within minutes, the stock market tumbled. The S&P 500 closed down 1.7%, its worst trading day since December.
March 4 – Tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China took effect at 12:01 a.m. ET. A near-instant trade war broke out. China and Canada each responded with retaliatory tariffs, vowing additional measures. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum slammed Trump's tariffs but said she would hold off on retaliatory measures until after a conversation with him. U.S. stocks extended their losses from the previous day.
March 5 – Trump ordered a one-month delay of auto tariffs after a request from the ""Big 3"" U.S. automakers: Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent company of Jeep and Chrysler. The reprieve triggered a stock market surge, resulting in gains for each of the major indexes by the end of the trading day.
March 6 – Trump signed executive orders temporarily pausing tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, a free trade agreement. Despite the easing of tariffs, U.S. stocks resumed their previous plunge. The S&P 500 dropped about 2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 2.5%.

7,2025-03-06,"Applications for U.S. jobless benefits fell last week as the labor market remains sturdy ahead of an expected purge of federal government employees
Applications for U.S. jobless benefits fell last week as the labor market remains sturdy ahead of an expected purge of federal government employees.
The number of Americans filing for jobless benefits fell by 21,000 to 221,000 for the week ending March 1, the Labor Department said Thursday. That's significantly fewer than the 236,000 new applications analysts expected.
Weekly applications for jobless benefits are considered a proxy for layoffs, which have remained mostly in a range between 200,000 and 250,000 for years.
The four-week average, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, inched up by 250 to 224,250.
Some analysts expect layoffs ordered by the Department of Government Efficiency to show up in the report in the coming weeks or months.
Earlier this week, two people familiar with the situation told The Associated Press that the IRS is drafting plans to cut its 90,000-person workforce by as much as half through a mix of layoffs, attrition and incentivized buyouts. The people spoke Tuesday on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to disclose the plans.
The layoffs are part of the Trump administration’s efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce through billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. 
Already, roughly 7,000 probationary IRS employees with roughly one year or less of service were laid off from the organization in February. 
Last week, senior U.S. officials set the government downsizing in motion via a memo dramatically expanding President Donald Trump’s efforts to scale back a workforce. Thousands of probationary employees have already been fired, and now the Republican administration is turning its attention to career officials with civil service protection.
Government agencies have been directed to submit by March 13 their plans for what is known as a reduction in force, which would not only lay off employees but eliminate positions altogether. 
Despite showing some signs of weakening during the past year, the labor market remains healthy with plentiful jobs and relatively few layoffs.
The Labor Department reported that U.S. employers added 143,000 jobs in January, significantly fewer than December’s 256,000 job gains. However, the unemployment rate ticked down to an even 4%, signaling a still very healthy labor market.
Overall, while layoffs remain low by historical standards, some high-profile companies have announced job cuts already this year.
Workday, Dow, CNN, Starbucks, Southwest Airlines and Facebook parent company Meta have all trimmed their workforces already in 2025.
The total number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits for the week of Feb. 22 rose by 42,000 to 1.9 million.

9,2025-03-06,"Shares of Macy’s fell in pre-market trading on Thursday after the major retailer reported mixed fourth quarter earnings and a downbeat outlook for sales, citing “external uncertainties.”
Macy’s said its sales slid by 4.3% to $7.7 billion for its latest quarter, falling just shy of analysts’ expectations of $7.78 billion, according to estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS+0.03%). Adjusted earnings totaled at $1.80 per share for the quarter, above the $1.54 per share Wall Street had expected. Profit came in at $342 million, compared with a $128 million loss a year earlier. 
Across Macy’s business — including the flagship Macy’s stores, Bloomingdale’s, and Blue Mercury (M+0.41%) — comparable sales fell 1.1%, while comparable sales across its owned and licensed businesses grew 0.2%. The department store giant said comparable sales at its First 50 stores — locations that it is investing in as part of a new strategy — grew by 0.8%, increasing for the fourth consecutive quarter. 
Although the earnings show that Macy’s turnaround is making some progress, its soft expectations for its fiscal 2025 earnings disappointed investors.
 New York-based Macy’s forecasted net sales between $21 billion and $21.4 billion, compared to Wall Street’s expected $21.3 billion. The guidance includes a $700 million hit from the closure of 64 Macy’s stores in 2024. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to come out to between $2.05 and $2.25 per share, below the $2.29 per share expected. 
Macy’s said it would continue to close underperforming stores in 2025, noting that it expects “fundamental improvements’ in 125 locations that have been picked out to work on. It expects those improvements to be offset by the roughly 225 stores that are either planned to be shut down or have not yet benefited from Macy’s new strategy, which includes hiring more staff and better product displays. 
“On a quarterly basis, the company does not expect its results to be linear as the year progresses, which is a reflection of the year two initiatives gaining traction, comparability impacts and the timing of asset sale gains,” Macy’s said in a statement.
The company also said that it is taking a “prudent approach” to guidance for the year, citing external uncertainties that it and customers are facing. That includes the threat of tariffs, which are poised to slam consumer confidence and raise prices on goods across multiple industries.
Fellow retailers Best Buy (BBY+1.11%), Target (TGT+0.54%), and Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF+3.96%) have issued more conservative guidance or warned of potential negative effects to their operations as a result of tariffs.
“I don’t think the consumer is going to feel a sense of relief in the short term,” Macy’s CEO Tony Spring said on an earnings call after noting that the company has to lean in to providing “retail therapy” and an escape from politics. 
Macy’s shares fell as much as 5% in pre-market trading on Thursday, sending the stock down to its lowest point in over a year, but are now down by less than 4%. The stock dropped by more than 19% year-to-date through Wednesday.

10,2025-03-06,"Top men's players will earn Â£135,000 more than leading women's players in The Hundred this year
The Professional Cricketers' Association (PCA) says the increasing disparity between the top salaries of men's and women's players in The Hundred ""cannot be allowed to continue"".
The Women's Impact Report, released before International Women's Day on 8 March, has called for more to be done after the gap in pay between the top men's and women's players widened from Â£75,000 to Â£135,000 for 2025.
In the men's competition, top-level players will see their pay increase by 60% to Â£200,000, compared to a 30% rise to Â£65,000 for leading women's stars as part of an overall 25% rise across all salary bands.
""Considering the tournament is marketed equally amongst the men's and women's squads with the two teams, one club mantra, which is to be applauded, it is more than disappointing to see the gender pay gap increase,"" the report from the players' union said.
The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) recently oversaw the sales of stakes in the eight Hundred franchises, with the teams achieving a collective value of more than Â£975m, bringing in about Â£520m to be split across the game in this country.
Given this ""influx of money"" through private investment, ""stakeholders in the game should be doing everything possible to close this gap, especially considering the increased interest, viewership and ticket sales for women's Hundred matches"", the report added.
The ECB said both men's and women's salary pots went up by about 25% in the latest increase and women's salaries alone increased by Â£800,000 in 2023.
An ECB spokesperson added: ""In the men's game, the latest increase was weighted towards the top end in order to be competitive in the global market.
""In the women's game, the increase was spread across the salary bands because we need to make more progress across the board.""
The PCA report did highlight the average salary of a women's player has increased from Â£8,000 in 2021 to Â£29,100 for this year's competition, with the lowest salary band up 278% to Â£10,000 from Â£3,600 four years ago.
Additionally, there has been a 364% growth in the overall Hundred budget pot from 2021 as the popularity of the women's game grows - 320,000 people watched women's games live in The Hundred in 2024, up from 267,000 in the first year of the competition.

The report also shows there has been a 538% increase in professional women's players since 2020 from 24 to 153, aided by a new tiered domestic set-up that sees eight professional teams merge with the men's counties.
This year the minimum salary for a women's domestic player will be Â£28,000, equal to that of their counterparts in the men's game.
""Gender equity in cricket can only be achieved when all professional players have equal opportunity to build viable careers and be the best cricketer they can be,"" said  Donna Fraser, PCA director of people, equity, diversity and inclusion.
There has also been a significant rise in the domestic remuneration pot from Â£720,000 in 2021 to Â£4m.
Meanwhile, there has been a 236% rise in average salary of an England player from four years ago.
""Every year there has been significant improvements to the contractual and commercial conditions of England players,"" said vice-captain Nat Sciver-Brunt.
""The bar is constantly being raised and player views are being listened to and prioritised.""
England women's match fees were increased to equal the men's players in 2023.

11,2025-03-06,"The temporary move expanded a carve-out issued for automakers a day earlier.
President Donald Trump on Thursday paused tariffs on some products from Mexico and Canada, temporarily withdrawing major portions of a policy issued two days earlier.
The one-month exemption will lift tariffs for all Canadian and Mexican goods compliant with United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, a free trade agreement, White House officials told ABC News.
Roughly 50% of imports from Mexico comply with USMCA, and 38% of imports from Canada comply with USMCA. Motor vehicles and auto accessories make up a good portion of the of USMCA-compliant trade, the officials added.
Despite pausing tariffs on a large number of goods from Canada and Mexico, Trump said on Thursday afternoon he is still sticking with his plan to issue tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum products starting next week.
""We're not looking at that,"" he said at the White House when asked about a pause on those tariffs.
The easing of tariffs on some Mexican goods came after a conversation between Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, Trump said Thursday in a post on Truth Social.
""Our relationship has been a very good one, and we are working hard, together, on the Border, both in terms of stopping Illegal Aliens from entering the United States and, likewise, stopping Fentanyl. Thank you to President Sheinbaum for your hard work and cooperation!"" Trump said.
Minutes later, Sheinbaum reciprocated in similar fashion.
""We had an excellent and respectful call in which we agreed that our work and collaboration have yielded unprecedented results, within the framework of respect for our sovereignties,"" Sheinbaum said in a post on X.
Trump made the announcement soon after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Thursday morning that a one-month delay of tariffs on Mexico and Canada would likely apply to all products compliant with the USMCA.
Trump negotiated the USMCA during his first term, signing the agreement with Canada and Mexico in 2018.
""That which is part of President Trump's deal with Canada and Mexico [is] likely to get an exemption from these tariffs,"" Lutnick told CNBC on Thursday morning.
Despite the effort to ease some tariffs, stocks dropped on Thursday as fallout from the policy continued to roil markets.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 425 points, or 1%, while the S&P 500 fell 1.7%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 2.6%.
The selloff erased some of the market gains delivered a day earlier after Trump gave U.S. automakers a one-month reprieve from the tariffs. Duties on a host of other goods remained in place, however.
The U.S. earlier this week slapped 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, as well as 10% tariffs on imports from China. The fresh round of duties on Chinese goods doubled an initial set of tariffs placed on China last month.
The one-month delay in auto tariffs triggered a rally for shares of U.S. carmakers on Wednesday, but the largest companies in the sector turned down on Thursday.
Shares of Ford ticked down 0.4%, while General Motors fell 2.6%. Stellantis -- the parent company of Chrysler and Jeep -- saw its stock price fall 1%.
Tesla, the electric carmaker led by Elon Musk, tumbled 5.5% on Thursday.
The exemptions on automobiles from the president's tariffs were a one-time thing, Trump told reporters at the White House on Thursday.
Trump said he told the automakers, ""'That's it.'""
The president added there would be some disruption resulting from the tariffs, but he brushed them off saying it would be ""short-term"" and adding that the tariffs have to be done.
""They'll always be a little short-term interruption. I don't think it's going to be big, but the countries and companies that have been ripping us aren't particularly happy with what I'm doing. But the United States will be very happy. And, you know, our farmers are going to be very happy,"" Trump said.
The tariffs were expected to pose a challenge for U.S. automakers, many of which depend on a supply chain closely intertwined with Mexico and Canada.
The American Automotive Policy Council, or AAPC, a trade group that represents Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, praised the one-month tariff exemption.
""American Automakers Ford, GM and Stellantis applaud President Trump for recognizing that vehicles and parts that meet the high US and regional USMCA content requirements should be exempt from these tariffs,"" AAPC President Matt Blunt told ABC News in a statement.

A blow-dry brush has become my holy grail hair styling device. Maybe you've heard the term, or one of its synonyms like heated brush, thermal brush, or blowout brush. These aren't all the same thing—blow-dry brushes blow out hot hair, acting as both a blow dryer and a brush, while thermal or heated brushes are brushes with a heated surface, creating a twist on a curling or straightening iron. My hair begs to be either diffused or blow-dried after a shower, and I rarely have time to blow-dry and style my hair with two separate devices—the single blow-dry brush has become a hair routine hero.
Some of the most popular models in the world of blow-dry brushes include the Dyson Airwrap (8/10, WIRED Recommends), the Drybar Double Shot, and BondiBoost Blowout Brush, along with the reason we're here today: the famed Revlon One-Step Volumizer Plus. The One-Step blow-dry brush originally launched in 2016, and the Plus is the most updated version, arriving in 2021. It's often touted as a much more affordable option in a field of pricey blow-dry brushes and hair tools, especially since its price tag is so low compared to the other options out there.
For such a cheap price, it does a great job delivering on its premise. The One-Step gives my hair a voluminous blowout, especially my curtain bangs, in a matter of minutes. It does give me a little more frizz and a little less polished ends than more expensive options like the Drybar and Dyson, though even the best of the blow-dry brushes will still add a little frizz. Regardless, the Revlon is easily the best bang for your buck if you're in the market for a blow-dry brush.
The One-Step is a pretty straightforward concept. It combines a round brush and a hair dryer into one device, allowing you to both dry and style your hair at the same time. It's easier to manage since it's a single device—I've never had the dexterity to manage two tools at the same time, let alone get good results. Keep in mind, though, that blow-dry brushes tend to make more frizz than using a blow dryer and a round brush, since the air is coming through the center of the brush rather than on top of it, thus blowing hair in multiple directions while you use it.
The Revlon One-Step Volumizer Plus has three heat settings, each with an attached airflow level, plus a fourth “cool” setting. You can't customize the air speed and heat, but that's true on more expensive models, too, so I wouldn't count that too heavily against the One-Step. Most other blow-dry brushes only have a cool mode and two heat settings, so while the Revlon is more affordable, it also offers more heat levels than you'll find on a Drybar brush or even the Dyson.
Revlon says the One-Step's three heat settings reach between 200 and 260 degrees Fahrenheit, though Revlon can't confirm how hot the individual levels will get. This range is a little hotter than others we've tested; the Shark FlexStyle (9/10, WIRED Recommends) reaches only 230 degrees Fahrenheit, for example, while T3's AireBrush ranges from about 170 degrees to 214 degrees Fahrenheit. That higher heat range adds to the extra frizz I find myself getting when I use the Revlon compared with a T3 or Dyson blow-dry brush, and does put me at risk for more damage than with the more expensive brushes.
Revlon recommends using the One-Step on damp hair, rather than wet hair. Ivy & Luna Studio co-owner and hairstylist Alanna Safarik-Ashby (also known as @folliclefatale) recommended I wait until my hair was 90 percent dry for the safest results when using any blow-dry brush. Using it on wet hair can lead to more damage since it pulls on your hair strands when they're at their most fragile, Safarik-Ashby explained.

Once your hair is mostly dry, section your hair into three or four sections and start blow drying. I always use a heat protectant when I use a blow-dry brush, and you can use other products, too, to add more volume and control any frizz. You'll get the best volume if you brush the blow-dry brush above and below the section of hair you're drying; the easiest hairstyle to achieve with the oval-shaped One-Step is a smooth style with flipped-out ends.
For maximum volume, Revlon recommends leaving the brush at the root for two or three seconds before brushing down the section of hair. I was especially impressed by the volume and shape I could achieve with the One-Step on my bangs. The One-Step helped me best channel my inner Sabrina Carpenter out of any blow-dry brush I've tried.
A big reason for the One-Step's popularity is its price point. It's often available for under $40, but even its MSRP of $70 still makes it a ridiculously well-priced purchase in a sea of devices that cost anywhere from the $160 T3 AireBrush all the way up to the $600 price tag for the Dyson Airwrap (8/10, WIRED Recommends).
This cheaper brush will get you to higher heat, but that's not necessarily a good thing with blow-dry brushes. Lower temperatures might take a little longer to get your hair dry, but will give you less frizz and a smoother result. The One-Step's higher heat will dry your hair faster, of course, and frizz would technically give you volume, but higher heat will also put you at risk for more heat damage.
The One-Step doesn't come with any extra accessories like other blow-dry brushes do, but it does have a detachable head. Revlon also makes other One-Step products, including the One-Step Blowout Curls ($65), an air-powered curling iron, but it doesn't sell the attachments separately for you to build out a set akin to the Shark or Dyson. Revlon confirms that there are no other heads that work with the One-Step blow-dryer brush, and that the head is removable solely for space reasons (e.g., better fitting in your suitcase). That's nice to an extent, but feels like a missed opportunity.
Either way, it's a great budget buy, even if you'll need to be careful with heat protectant. If you're looking to try out a blow-dry brush without dropping serious cash, you'll get a pretty similar experience with the Revlon One-Step that you would with more expensive options.

OK, so maybe that's not a thing. But it might have been for a Vallejo, Calif., man who authorities allege stole thousands of dollars in Lego merchandise from Target stores.

Well, it turns out that the iconic bricks and figurines can have a return value that rivals traditional investments, including gold.
That's according to one study from 2021, in which researchers from the Higher School of Economics in Moscow found that select unopened Lego sets on the resale market saw an average annual return of 11%.

Stocks continued to decline Thursday amid Wall Street uncertainty around tariffs that were imposed on Canada and Mexico this week by President Donald Trump and later suspended.

	The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 1%, or about 430 points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped 2.6% to finish in correction territory, where it had been earlier in the week. A correction is defined as an index dropped more than 10% below its closing high. Gains by tech shares have been a significant engine of growth for the overall market in recent years.

	Netflix, which has trader near all-time highs in recent weeks after a banner earnings report in January, declined 8.5% to $906.36, while Amazon and Meta Platforms both were off 4% and Roku dipped 6%. A number of large media companies also saw a downturn, with Disney down 3.55% to $105.43 and Warner Bros. Discovery surrendering 6% to $10.70.

	The implementation of tariffs on Tuesday discouraged many economists and investors, but the markets have been even more unsettled by the whipsawing of policy throughout the week. 

	After deciding on Wednesday to exempt automakers from the tariffs, lest the initiative send vehicle prices soaring, the White House then expanded the relief to other industries. Tariffs on consumer goods will be paused until April 2, administration officials announced, but conflict nevertheless continued between longtime North American allies. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau a “numbskull” and said his approach to trade negotiations would lead to higher tariffs on Canadian imports.

	“If you want to be a numbskull like Justin Trudeau and say, ‘Oh we’re going to do this,’ then tariffs are going to go up.” Bessent said at an Economic Club of New York event. “If you want to sit back and have a discussion with the Commerce Department, USTR – they have my phone number too – then I am happy to have a discussion with our foreign counterparts.”

20,2025-03-06,Space-exploration company Intuitive Machines is set to make its second moon landing Thursday.
21,2025-03-06,"Business Insider Edition 
Happy almost Friday! If you're indulging in a Thirsty Thursday — Do people still call it that? —don't be surprised if happy hour looks a bit gray. While millennials and Gen Zers are cutting back on booze, the number of boomers tipping one (or a few) back is rising.

        In today's big story, Microsoft is rethinking how it evaluates employees and handles underperformers.
    

What's on deck:


Markets: The jobs report is tomorrow, but don't expect a DOGE-sized drop in numbers. Here's why.
    

Tech: Meta's got a list of ex-employees it won't rehire.
    

Business: Lulu Cheng Meservey's brash PR tactics annoy some of her peers, but her big-name clients can't get enough of it.
    

        But first, HR is going to join us for this one.
    

If this was forwarded to you, sign up here.


Microsoft'sperformance review is on a PIP.


        The tech giant is rethinking how it evaluates employees, according to Business Insider's Ashley Stewart, who spoke to several people with knowledge of the plans.
    

        The result could be Microsoft taking a tougher stance on employees deemed low performers. Evidence of that came earlier this year when Microsoft made hundreds of performance-based cuts in January and February.
    

        In many ways, it's a blast from the past for Microsoft, which once had a reputation for conducting tough reviews. The arrival of Satya Nadella as CEO more than a decade ago changed that, with the company taking a softer stance. Some even called Microsoft a ""country club.""
    

        Microsoft's current process for managing out low performers can take months of documentation. One high-level manager told Ashley the average time to exit a low performer after a manager notified HR was about seven months. That process can be further delayed if an employee takes a leave of absence, which can reset the clock.
    

        But with the AI race heating up, Microsoft wants to move faster and more efficiently. Like its peers Meta, Amazon, and Google, that's meant taking a deeper look at its performance review and management process.
    

Microsoft's potential pivot also shows where AI's had the most impact thus far.


        Since ChatGPT's arrival a few years ago, there's been plenty of speculation about all the jobs that were at risk of being automated away by AI.
    

        The reality, though, is the tech isn't advanced enough to replace most roles completely. Efficiencies can be achieved that allow a company to cut some headcount, but AI hasn't completely wiped out jobs in most cases.
    

        In fact, the industry AI is disrupting the most is the one building it: tech.
    

        It's not just a matter of AI automating people's jobs. (Although those are looking dicey for software engineers.) The massive bets tech giants are making on AI are forcing them to recalibrate their entire operations to be as streamlined as possible, and those changes don't come easy.
    

        Perhaps the shift was always coming. The rise of interest rates and the maturation of these companies might have naturally led to a stage of buckling down.
    

        But spending billions on tech that hasn't fully panned out from a business perspective certainly didn't slow things down.
    

1. Federal workers' layoff pains will be mostly invisible in Friday's jobs report. DOGE's February firings won't be reflected in the Bureau of Labor Statistics report because of the cuts' timing. And even though the job losses will appear in a more distant report, they probably won't make a big dent overall.
    

2. Are we on the verge of a ""Trumpcession""? Wall Street exec Jeffrey Solomon is part of a small but growing group of forecasters using the dreaded R-word: recession. In an interview with CNBC, Solomon said a trade war could impact supply chains and prompt business leaders to pump the brakes on dealmaking. Some signs already point to an economic slowdown, and Solomon isn't alone in waving the red flag.
    

3. Brevan Howard is telling investors the ""true risk"" is not getting in on crypto. For years, institutions have kept their distance from digital assets. Brevan Howard's CEO told BI the tipping point for institutional investors is on the horizon, thanks to the boost provided by President Trump and crypto czar David Sacks. The firm, whose digital assets unit was up more than 52% in 2024, wants to be the go-to place for crypto-curious institutions.
    

1. Meta keeps ""block"" lists of ex-employees. Hiring managers at Meta sometimes pursue laid-off workers for rehire. They express interest, set up a screening call — and then ghost. That's because some ex-employees are on lists that deem them ""ineligible for rehire,"" even if they have a written track record of exceeding managers' expectations. BI's story elicited a reaction from former Google HR chief Laszlo Bock.
    

2. Google Search is going AI Mode. The tech giant said it plans to test a new ""AI Mode"" feature for Search that aims to answer users' queries with ""a wider and more diverse"" set of AI-powered results. Instead of AI Overviews, which respond to queries with a direct answer at the top of the results page, the new AI Mode takes things a step further by generating an entire page.
    

3. Big events for big ratings. TV networks have been struggling with maintaining their audiences for years. But BI's Peter Kafka picked up on a pattern to get more eyes: streaming must-watch live sports and awards shows. The most recent Oscars, the Super Bowl, and the Olympics got bumps in viewers, and streaming was part of their equation.
    

1. Meet the PR pitbull adored by Sam Altman and Bari Weiss. Lulu Cheng Meservey is one of Silicon Valley's most sought-after communications gurus, known for her unusually aggressive ""going direct"" strategy. Less enchanted are her PR peers, who aren't sold on her style of bucking convention, tweeting madly, and playing offense with the press. Still, Cheng Meservey won the admiration of startup founders by showing them how she thinks.
    

2. A new DOGE staffer was connected to a fertility clinic and has ties to the pronatalist movement. Miles Collins, whose association with DOGE was first reported by BI, is a startup founder who employees say has been working at the Department of Labor. Collins was connected to a California fertility clinic that's now facing lawsuits accusing it of mistreating employees, although the company has denied wrongdoing. Collins is also the brother of a prominent pronatalist, a movement that Elon Musk has also spoken in favor of.
    

3. A tariff breather for car companies. President Donald Trump is giving the Big Three automakers — Stellantis, Ford, and General Motors — a one-month pause on his recent tariffs to avoid an ""economic disadvantage."" But there won't be another break when Trump's second round of trade-related tariffs takes effect on April 2, and additional tariffs on steel and aluminum are coming this month.

    The food coloring has been linked to thyroid cancer in rats and is already banned in parts of Europe, Asia and certain US states.
  
Red No. 3 has long been used to give certain candy its striking color. 
Earlier this year, the US Food and Drug Administration revoked authorization of Red Dye No. 3, a widely used food coloring that has been linked to thyroid cancer. While the ruling spells an eventual end for all use of the culinary colorant, food companies will have several years to remove it from production.
Here's everything to know about foods that currently use the synthetic red dye. 
Red No. 3 -- also known as FD&C Red No. 3, erythrosine or Red 3 -- is a synthetic dye that is made from petroleum and adds a ""bright, cherry-red color"" to the products it is added to.  
In 1990, the FDA banned Red No. 3 in cosmetics, but no law barred the synthetic dye from being added to numerous types of foods and drinks for decades to come. 
The FDA cited the Delaney Clause as its reasoning behind the ban, which ""prohibits FDA authorization of a food additive or color additive if it has been found to induce cancer in humans or animals.""
Although studies did show a link to cancer in laboratory rats, a link between the dye and cancer in humans has not been found. 
""While there are studies noting carcinogenicity in male rats, the FDA noted in their announcement that the hormonal mechanism through which the dye caused cancer in rats is specific to the animal and does not occur in humans,"" Bryan Hitchcock, chief science and technology officer of the Institute of Food Technologists, told CNET. 
Hitchcock added that the studies used large amounts of the dye, which is more than what the average human would consume when eating the foods that contain it. 
""Studies testing Red No. 3 for human safety have done so at amounts well above the average amount of consumption, as noted by various global regulatory bodies,"" he says. ""The studies referenced by the FDA note that the rats were given roughly 200 times the likely maximum daily consumption of .25 mg/kg of body weight per day.""
Red No. 3 has previously been banned in other countries, including Australia. 
Some specific items that currently have Red No. 3 on its ingredient list are: 
According to a list compiled by Drugs.com, some of the drugs that have Red No. 3 in them include: 
The Environmental Working Group has compiled a searchable database of food products that use the now banned dye. As of Feb. 5, 2025, the site had collected 3,092 products that list Red No. 3 as an ingredient. 
Despite the ban, don't expect to see the Red No. 3 ingredient disappear from ingredient lists too quickly. According to the FDA, companies will have until 2027 or 2028 to remove it from their products.
""Manufacturers who use FD&C Red No. 3 in food and ingested drugs will have until January 15, 2027, or January 18, 2028, respectively, to reformulate their products,"" the FDA statement reads. 
Red Dye No. 3 will soon be replaced by food coloring made from beets and other natural ingredients.
Givaudan Sense Colour, a manufacturing company that creates natural food and drink colorings, highlighted three possible alternatives to Red No. 3 -- carmine, which is actually made from bugs; betacyanins, found in beetroots; and anthocyanins, derived from fruits and vegetables. 
California Assembly member Jesse Gabriel told NBC News that although synthetic dyes can be cheaper than other alternatives, he does not believe that the Red No. 3 ban will cause prices of the affected products to change.
""We don't expect the price of any food to increase,"" he told the outlet.  
As for alternative synthetic dyes, Red 40, which is not banned by the FDA, can also help achieve a bright red color, so it is also a possible alternative that manufacturers will choose. 
After the Red No. 3 ban, there are now eight color additives approved by the FDA. They are FD&C Blue No. 1, FD&C Blue No. 2, FD&C Green No. 3, Orange B, Citrus Red No. 2, FD&C Red No. 40, FD&C Yellow No. 5 and FD&C Yellow No. 6. 
Hitchcock says that so far, studies show that there is not a notable risk to consuming these dyes. 
""While science tells us that there is little to no risk in consuming other synthetic dyes, it is important that we continue to monitor and evaluate food ingredient safety,"" he says. ""It is paramount that we continue to invest in more scientific research around the health of our foods to ensure safety and provide peace of mind for consumers.""
According to the FDA, the above dyes do not pose the same possible risks as Red No. 3, which is why they are still available for use in the US. But, some studies show possible links between certain dyes and potential health conditions. For example, some studies have linked Red 40 to hyperactivity, according to the Cleveland Clinic, but further studies are still needed to determine a direct link between the dye and the condition. 
When asked about the safety of other food dyes, Hitchcock highlighted the need for transparency from the FDA, which he says the agency has been addressing. 
""We believe there needs to be a clear framework for post-market review for food additive safety,"" Hitchcock says. ""The FDA is actively working to address this issue as seen in their Development of an Enhanced Systematic Process for the FDA's Post-Market Assessment of Chemicals in Food. IFT believes that the FDA needs to bring forward a post-market assessment of chemical food safety that is transparent, scientifically grounded, constituent informed and timely."" 
If a drink looks too red to be natural, it probably is.
Red No. 3 has been fully banned in the US, but it will continue to be used in food for the next two years as manufacturers work to change their recipes. However, some manufacturers are making changes much more quickly than that. 
In an email to CBS News, Keurig Dr Pepper said that a ""new formula"" for Yoo-hoo Strawberry Flavored Drink, which is currently made with Red No. 3 to help achieve its color, ""will be on shelves before the end of the year."""

    These six factors are likely to keep upward pressure on home prices in 2025.
  
One of the most common questions I get as a real estate professional is, ""When are home prices going to come down?"" 
It makes sense, of course, with the headlines predicting crashes, recessions and market downturns. Buying a home is a huge financial decision, and it's natural to wait for the housing market to become more affordable. 
Except real estate doesn't behave the way a lot of people think it does. Sure, home values can fluctuate, but prices are stuck at all-time highs. We can partly blame inflation, which is making everything more expensive. We can also blame a massive housing shortage for keeping competition up. Across most of the US, we still don't have enough homes available for those who want to buy them. 
It's my job as a realtor to tell my clients never to rush out to buy the first home they see. But if you're still sitting on the sidelines waiting for a major drop in home prices, you might be waiting forever. 
A lot of people think real estate is like a stock -- prices go up, prices go down. If you time the market, you can get in at the lowest possible price. Except homes aren't like stocks at all. 
Home prices don't just suddenly drop. A combination of factors prevents them from falling significantly, from supply and demand to inflation, from mortgage rates to homeowners' emotional attachment to their properties. 
I've been in the real estate industry long enough to know that housing downturns don't happen in a vacuum. Let's dive into the key reasons why a big price drop in today's market is unlikely. 
At its core, the housing market is driven by supply and demand. When there are more buyers than available homes, prices go up. Depending on what report you read, the US is short between four and six million homes.
The severe undersupply of homes has been a problem for over a decade. After the 2008 financial crisis, homebuilding slowed dramatically and never fully ramped back up. Restrictive zoning laws and rising construction costs have made it difficult to build new homes at the pace needed. In many areas, the high cost of breaking ground on new construction incentivizes builders to just focus on higher-end homes, leaving first-time buyers with even fewer options. 
At the same time, demand for homes is strong. Millennials, the largest generation in the country, are in their prime homebuying years, and many are determined to buy. As long as market demand exceeds supply, home prices will stay strong.
If you've been to the grocery store, filled up your gas tank or paid for any service lately, you've seen firsthand how inflation affects prices. Housing is no different.
Inflation puts long-term upward pressure on prices. After peaking in early 2022, inflation started to ease after the Federal Reserve's series of interest rate hikes. But recent data shows consumer prices rising again. 
As inflation erodes the value of money, tangible assets like real estate become more expensive. A home that cost $300,000 in 2010 would now be worth around $427,000 just from inflation alone. Even if housing demand cools temporarily, home values tend to rise over time simply because of how our financial system works. 
Selling a home isn't as simple as listing it online and waiting for offers. It's a process that comes with significant costs for sellers, including real estate commissions, closing costs, staging expenses and potential repairs.
For many homeowners, selling is expensive and doesn't make much financial sense. Sellers would rather stay put than take a financial hit, and fewer homes on the market prevent prices from falling.
The rate-lock effect is one of the biggest reasons why existing homes aren't hitting the market. 
During the pandemic, millions of homeowners locked in ultra-low mortgage rates, some as low as 2 to 3%. These homeowners are not eager to trade their sub-3% mortgage for a new one at 7%. Even with home values rising, many homeowners don't want to take on a significantly higher mortgage payment for their next home. 
Until mortgage rates come down substantially, many homeowners will stay put, keeping inventory tight and prices steady.
Most sellers are also buyers. Every home that gets sold is usually offset by another purchase. Unlike in 2008, when foreclosures flooded the market, today's sellers are typically moving by choice, not out of necessity.
Demand for homes has a lot to do with life stages. People get married, have kids, relocate for jobs, downsize or look for better schools. Even in a high-rate environment over the last two years, these factors have kept the housing market moving.
People have a deep emotional connection to their homes, and that plays a role in pricing. When homeowners see a neighbor's house sell for top dollar, they often believe their home is worth the same or more. Even in slower markets, homeowners are reluctant to accept lower offers unless they absolutely have to sell.
Unlike stocks, where people are quick to cut losses, homeowners tend to hold onto their properties rather than take a perceived loss. This is another reason why home prices tend to be sticky, even during economic downturns.
I often hear the argument that home prices will drop if we enter a recession. While it's true that economic downturns can impact housing, most recessions don't lead to significant price declines.
Historically, home prices have remained stable or even risen during recessions. Layoffs tend to impact lower-income workers who are less likely to be homeowners, and those who do own homes typically have enough equity to avoid distressed sales. Unlike in 2008, where risky lending led to foreclosures, today's homeowners are in a much stronger financial position.
Over the last 60 years, home prices have appreciated at an average rate of 4.6% per year. If you're waiting for a housing crash, you're betting against a trend that has been remarkably consistent. 
Even if home prices stagnate, interest rates could stay high, which impacts affordability far more than a small price drop. And it could end up costing you more to wait. Renting instead of buying means missing out on years of home equity, and inflation will just continue making homes more expensive over time. 
If you're trying to decide whether to buy, focus on your own financial situation rather than trying to time the market. 
Financial stability: If you can afford a down payment, make sure your projected monthly mortgage payment is comfortable and sustainable. You should also have enough money in the bank for closing costs, insurance, taxes and other homeowner fees.
Consider different markets: Not all real estate markets are created equal. Pay attention to what's happening in your specific area. At the time of this article, Florida inventory is growing while the Northeast is still in very short supply.
Think long term: Real estate is not about what will happen today or tomorrow but rather decades from now. As a general rule, plan to stay in your home for at least five or seven years so that short-term market fluctuations won't matter much."

Why Trump’s tariff policy been so chaotic this week.
by  Nicole Narea
President Donald Trump’s tariffs have had a chaotic week. First, they were on, then they were great, then they were maybe off, then definitely off (but just for now).
After the Trump administration enacted its 25 percent tariffs on most Mexican and Canadian goods on Tuesday, stocks immediately fell. As of Thursday, the S&P 500 had fallen almost four percent since the beginning of the week.
For now, those tariffs appear to be on hold. After creating a temporary carve-out for goods imported by US car manufacturers on Wednesday, Trump announced on Thursday that he would pause tariffs on many, but not all Mexican and Canadian goods for another month. 
Canada’s retaliatory tariffs are expected to remain in effect, at least for now. It’s unclear whether Mexico will proceed with its planned tariffs on US goods, which were expected to be announced Sunday.
The turnabout was surprising: Trump initially claimed that he would not consider any exceptions to the tariffs, and praised them at length during his speech to Congress Tuesday.
The White House hasn’t said what made Trump change his mind. But it is possible that the shock his tariffs caused to the stock market entered into his decision-making. 
Trump certainly gave the markets a lot of attention during his first term, when he frequently touted the record highs the stock market reached under his tenure, appearing to view it as a direct reflection of the strength of his economic policies. 
It’s worth mentioning that presidents don’t have much control over the economy, and Trump arrived in office when the economy was already pretty strong. However, his decision-making often appeared to be influenced by the stock market.
In 2018, he publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for raising interest rates, claiming that it was driving down the stock market: “The only problem our economy has is the Fed. They don’t have a feel for the Market,” he posted on social media. 
And in early 2019, when the markets dipped in response to Trump’s tariffs on China, he walked back or delayed some of the tariffs. 
His 2017 corporate tax cuts, which reduced the maximum tax rate from 39 percent to 21 percent, also seemed designed to be market-friendly, and investors are hoping that he’ll extend those cuts this year.
One other economic indicator that may have influenced Trump’s tariff policy is one that the president seems to have developed a new focus on during his second term: a benchmark known as the 10-year Treasury bond yield. 
That yield is the interest rate that the federal government pays to Treasury bondholders each year on loans that mature after 10 years. 
The 10-year Treasury yield is considered a key indicator of the strength of the US economy and affects borrowing costs for everything from the $12.6 trillion mortgage market to $5.8 trillion in bank lending. The current yield is about 4.2 percent. 
That rate isn’t set by the government but rather determined by Wall Street through an auction process. If financial institutions are feeling good about the US’s financial outlook, their bids at these bond auctions may be lower. If they’re predicting economic turbulence and staring down a national debt crisis, as is currently the case, those bids may be higher. 
In the immediate aftermath of Trump’s reelection, the 10-year Treasury rate rose sharply. It’s come down since peaking in January, but rose again amid the uncertainty and fear created by Trump’s tariffs.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said that lowering the Treasury yield could bring financial relief to struggling Americans, and Trump heralded a “big, beautiful drop” in Treasury yields during his address to Congress on Tuesday.
It’s difficult to say what’s driving Trump’s tariff policymaking for certain. But based on past behavior, the stocks and bond markets seem like important factors to watch.

27,2025-03-06,"A Samsung executive says durability will be a key aspect of the ultra-slim smartphone.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is set to become one of the thinnest smartphones on the market, and making any piece of technology that slim is a balance. By making a phone slimmer, battery life and performance could drop as a consequence. Additionally, thinner devices are more likely to bend, especially if they're using the same materials and construction as their thicker counterparts — does anyone remember ""bendgate"" on the iPhone 6?
Luckily, it seems that Samsung is aware of the risks of building an ultra-slim smartphone and plans to attack durability concerns head-on. While Samsung has been tight-lipped regarding Galaxy S25 Edge specs, Samsung's UK Marketing Director Annika Bizon first confirmed to TechRadar that durability is one of two ""really exciting"" features for the South Korean company.
First, Bizon discussed the accomplishment of building a flagship phone in a form factor rumored to be just 5.84mm thick. ""I can’t say too much, but what I will say is that [the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge] is about beautiful form factor. And there are two points I want to make,” Bizon told TechRadar. “One is that it’s absolutely stunning. And if you think about the technology that’s going into that size of space, it’s pretty impressive.""

Next, the Samsung exec touted the Galaxy S25 Edge's durability, which is crucial for the phone to be successful. Thinner phones are widely believed to be less durable than thicker ones, and the company will need to dispel that notion to get customers to buy into the Galaxy S25 Edge's impossible form factor.
""The second thing I’ll say concerns durability. With anything slim, durability [has to come as part of the package]. Those are the two features [of the Edge] that are exciting [for us],"" said Bizon in the TechRadar interview. ""Well, I know durability isn't exciting — but it's really important. So watch this space, because there are some exciting things to come regarding this phone.""
As has been the case with past Galaxy S25 Edge teasers, these comments about the phone's durability are quite cryptic. Fortunately, recent Galaxy S25 Edge rumors and leaks might shed some light on what durability breakthroughs Samsung is talking about. A report from SamMobile predicts the smartphone will use an Armor Aluminum frame, but in a first for Samsung, could feature ceramic on the back. At the moment, it's unclear whether the back is tipped to be fully ceramic or glass-infused ceramic.

I'm inclined to believe that Samsung has a few other durability tricks up its sleeve beyond the rumored use of ceramic. That's because ceramic isn't exactly new to smartphones. Ceramic-infused glass is currently used on the Galaxy S25 Ultra's Gorilla Armor, and it's also available as Ceramic Shield on iPhones. Additionally, longtime Android fans might remember that the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus was actually offered in a ridiculous $1,2500 variant with a fully-ceramic back.

But focusing on the ceramic rumor reveals a few key benefits for the Galaxy S25 Edge. For starters, ceramic is stronger than glass, which would help the Galaxy S25 Edge's durability. Wireless charging also works through both ceramic and ceramic-infused glass, so that's still an option. Although the frame of the Galaxy S25 Edge is still rumored to be aluminum, a ceramic back and/or a ceramic-infused glass front could add structural integrity to this phone — reducing the likelihood of the Galaxy S25 Edge bending.
The other benefit of ceramic no one seems to be talking about is that it has a higher thermal conductivity than glass. What does this mean for the Galaxy S25 Edge? Essentially, it means heat coming from the rumored Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and the battery would be dissipated better with a ceramic back compared to glass. This could reduce thermal throttling and allow the Galaxy S25 Edge to perform well despite its constrained form factor.
Even if the rumors are true, and ceramic is the only durability improvement offered on this phone, it could go a long way to making the Galaxy S25 Edge less prone to bending than other thin phones.

If there's a theme with the Galaxy S25 Edge, at least from Samsung's perspective, it's limiting compromises. The goal of this handset appears to be to offer an ultra-thin smartphone with as few sacrifices as possible.
“The thing with slim phones is people want to know that they’re still getting very good technology,"" Bizon explains. ""Innovation is in our DNA. It’s about the right timing, and when we think a product is ready to take to market, coupled with the fact that people do want form factor changes.""

    The year's biggest phone show, Mobile World Congress, often has some wild handsets -- here's the cream of the bizarre crop.
  
RealMe's phone concept mounts a mirrorless camera lens on the back of it.
Every year, phone makers flock to Mobile World Congress to reveal their latest and greatest devices. At MWC 2025 in Barcelona, we've already seen some incredible new handsets headed to stores later this year, as well as concept devices we could see in the years to come.
MWC occurs at a prime position: While Samsung always jumps the gun by announcing its phones in January, as seen with the Samsung Galaxy S25 series, other phone makers wait to tease their upcoming devices in late February or early March at the mobile industry's biggest event of the year.
Many of these phones are cutting-edge but still conventional enough to compete with the Galaxy S25 for mainstream consumers. But in Barcelona, we also get to see the strange, inventive designs that phone makers are showing off. These have more specialty customers in mind, so not all will get wide releases.
Admittedly, some of these are concept phones, which won't reach the market at all but, instead, serve as proofs of concept for intriguing ideas that could trickle down someday. Sometimes, it's a matter of technology needing to be further developed, or for novel components to become commonplace enough to be affordable -- we saw foldable phone screens at MWC for years before they arrived in market-ready devices. 
Here are the weirdest phones at MWC 2025.
The Xiaomi modular camera concept.
Not one, but two phone makers have showcased new concept devices that have full-size camera lenses you can attach to the back of a smartphone.
Xiaomi calls its concept the ""modular optical system,"" which magnetically attaches the added camera lens to the back of the smartphone body. It has an even larger four-thirds image sensor (a size and ratio common on digital camera lenses) than the Xiaomi 15 Ultra's 1-inch type image sensor (which isn't actually an inch in size), connects to the middle of the back of the phone below the conventional camera block and takes pretty good photos, as CNET editor Andrew Lanxon found. 
RealMe also had a concept device with digital camera-size lenses you could attach. Unlike Xiaomi's device, however, RealMe's can mount full-frame mirrorless lenses, which are larger and could potentially take better photos. It also has an adapter that allows the mounting of professional-level lenses, like a Leica M11 or Canon R6. 
Samsung Display always comes to MWC with interesting concepts.
Samsung Display can reliably be trusted to debut exciting and intriguing concept devices at MWC. This year, the company's screen division had a couple ideas for future foldable handsets. 
The first is a foldable gaming console, which looks like a Z Flip-style clamshell foldable wrapped in a case with gaming controls on either side -- a thumbstick and a ring of buttons surrounding a hole -- but inverted, such that when the device is closed, the thumbstick fits in the button hole of the other. While we saw it run games, it's unclear whether this concept device is more of a smartphone with a neat case or a bespoke mobile gaming handset.
Samsung's dual-folding concept was like a variation on the Galaxy Z Flip.
Samsung also showed off a unique foldable we haven't seen before: a clamshell-style folding phone with two hinges. Even stranger, each folding limb was a different size, with a smaller flap on the top and larger flap on the bottom -- and when folded up, they don't fully cover the central part. Presumably, this is to ensure that both can fold inward and not run into each other, but it looks strange. Unfold each flap partway, though, and the phone does look a bit like the 90s cell phones that flipped down their thin mouthpieces.
If you had to guess, would you say this is a phone from the past or the future?
Lastly, Samsung Display had a more unique take on its Z Flip clamshell series -- rather than the sleek modern look of last year's Galaxy Z Flip 6, the company redesigned its external display around a retro-futuristic look with polygonal gray plastic, a la Disney parks' Space Mountain or old PC and Apple computer housings. A stylish look for what's now a conventional foldable.
The RedMagic 10 Pro Golden Saga edition.
The $650 RedMagic 10 Pro gaming phone came out just before the end of last year, but there's a new version around. For nearly three times the price, you can get the same phone built with precious metals: gold-wrapped, with gold and silver plating in its cooling system, a carbon fiber body and a sapphire glass rear cover. The Golden Saga phone, as it's called, costs $1,500 for a fancier-looking version of the same gaming phone.
There's also a Mora Pink version of the RedMagic 10 Pro if you want a more affordable version with just a bit more pizazz. "

    You may be eligible for part of the large cash settlement -- check this list of affected Apple Watch models.
  
Some Apple Watch models may be at risk of damage from swollen batteries. 
If you've got an Apple Watch, you may be eligible for a payout. Apple has agreed to a $20 million settlement after facing a class action lawsuit, and if your device is affected, you have until April 10 to submit a claim to secure your share. 
The lawsuit, filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California, alleged that the batteries in first-generation, Series 1, Series 2 and Series 3 models could expand within their tight compartments, causing malfunctions. Apple has denied any wrongdoing but chose to settle the case.

In a statement sent to CNET, Apple disputed the claims, stating that the Apple Watch is ""designed to be safe and reliable."" 
""This settlement applies to purchasers of Original Apple Watch, Series 1, Series 2 and Series 3, which are no longer available for purchase,"" the company said in a statement. ""While we strongly disagree with the claims made against these early generation Apple Watch models, we agreed to settle to avoid further litigation.""
To qualify for compensation, you must have owned an Original, Series 1, Series 2 and/or Series 3 Apple Watch model in the US and you also must have reported issues related to battery swelling, such as filing a complaint with customer service, between April 24, 2015, and Feb. 6, 2024.
The amount you receive will vary according to several factors. Compensation will likely range from $20 to $50, depending on the number of claims submitted. 
Some eligible people will receive a notice via email or postcard informing them of their eligibility for a class payment, according to WatchSettlement.com.
The Apple Watch Series 3 is one of the models included in the settlement.
If you're seeking a payout, you must submit your request through the settlement website by April 10, 2025.
After visiting the settlement website, you'll find a QR code. Scan it with an app or built-in camera option. Then, you can select how you'd prefer to receive your payment: physical check, electronic check, ACH transfer or virtual prepaid Visa or MasterCard. 
If you did not receive a notice but still believe you're eligible, you can file a claim via email. 
By accepting the settlement payment, you waive your rights to pursue further legal action against Apple regarding the battery issue."

The impact of Donald Trump's cuts to the federal workforce largely won't yet show up in the economy's monthly employment report card because of the timing of the firings and data collection.

        It matters because large-scale job losses are one early sign of a weakening economy. And as Trump's new tariffs have some worried about an uptick in inflation, Americans will be watching the economic data closely in the coming months for signs of a downturn.
    

        Economists told Business Insider that for now, however, the federal government job cuts inspired by Trump's DOGE office aren't likely to show up in the official unemployment figures.
    

        The Bureau of Labor Statistics will publish the closely watched US jobs report on Friday, showing how the labor market changed last month. The two surveys behind the numbers capture a snapshot of the economy in the middle of the month. Sincemany of the DOGE-inspired employment cuts happened during and after that period, they won't show up until the jobs report set to come out the first week of April.
    

        Daniel Zhao, a lead economist at Glassdoor, said many of the fired government workers would still be considered employed in the household survey, which is used to estimate the unemployment rate. The reference week for this month's report, or the period when the Census Bureau and BLS go out asking Americans if they have a job, was February 9 to 15. Many of the cuts happened during or after that week; any government employees who were still working for at least part of that week will show up as employed in the coming jobs report.
    

        For example, the Department of Veterans Affairs dismissed more than 1,000 people on February 13 and more than 1,000 on February 24. The Internal Revenue Service made job cuts on February 20.
    

        ""It's unlikely cuts that happened between February 12 and February 20 would show up in the February jobs report,"" Zhao told BI.
    

        The second survey behind the jobs report, which canvasses businesses across the country, has a similar timeframe. The survey, which uses the pay period including the 12th of the month, also isn't likely to show most of those government terminations.
    

        Despite the timing of the surveys, Julia Pollak, the chief economist at ZipRecruiter, told BI that February's change in federal employment could end up being quite a bit lower than what's been seen in the past couple of years.
    

        ""As of mid-February, about 75,000 federal workers had resigned under the Trump administration's 'deferred resignation' program,"" Pollak said. ""It is unclear whether these people will still be counted as being on payroll.""
    

        In April, the BLS will publish the jobs report covering the state of the market in mid-March — that's likely to show a drop in federal employment. Gregory Daco, EY's chief economist, told BI that the cuts to the federal workforce would ""undoubtedly impact the March payrolls print, but we don't know by how much.""
    

        Among DOGE's early targets were probationary workers, who have typically been in their roles for only a short period. Even if the Trump administration cut all of the roughly 200,000 federal workers who have been in their roles for less than a year, the impact on the overall workforce wouldn't be too large. Daco said federal employment accounts for less than 2% of US employment.
    

        David Kelly, the chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said in a note that ""contrary to popular opinion,"" federal government civilian employment ""has not been rising quickly in recent years."" The BLS said there were 3 million federal employees in January, up by just about 1.6% from a year earlier.
    

        That doesn't mean the recent terminations won't affect Americans and government functions. IRS workers told BI they expected tax season to be affected by the terminations of probationary workers. Kelly said that ""the volume of layoffs and quits will likely slow many of the functions of the federal government, ultimately impacting both private businesses and American citizens.""
    

        More turnover is expected in the federal workforce this year. A memo from the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management said agencies should ""seek reductions in components and positions that are non-critical"" and consider areas to consolidate, including management. It asked agencies to put together reorganization plans by March 13. The Department of Education, meanwhile, proposed a ""one time offer in advance of a very significant Reduction in Force"" to employees.
    

        Additionally, Pollak said there could be job losses in the private sector ahead because of contractors affected by cuts to budgets and programs.

ZS Stock
 
Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS), a cloud-based cybersecurity company, reported strong second quarter fiscal 2025 results (fiscal year ending in July), with earnings of $0.78 per share on sales of $648 million. These figures surpassed analyst expectations of $0.69 per share and $634 million in revenue. Additionally, Zscaler's Q3 forecast exceeded market predictions.
The company's success is attributed to growing adoption of its AI-enhanced Zero Trust security platform. This positive performance is reflected in Zscaler's stock price, which rose 5% in pre-market trading.
While investors remain optimistic about Zscaler's product adoption, those seeking consistent returns might want to consider diversified investment options such as the High-Quality portfolio, which has delivered over 91% returns since its inception.
In the second quarter, Zscaler demonstrated robust financial performance with its revenue reaching $648 million, representing a 23% year-over-year increase, primarily fueled by increased adoption of its Zero Trust offerings. The company's annual recurring revenue (ARR) exceeded $2.7 billion at the end of Q2, growing approximately 23% year over year. The company's forward-looking indicator, Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO), showcased strong potential by expanding 28% year-over-year to $4.6 billion. Zscaler expanded its high-value customer base, reaching 620 clients with over $1 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) and 3,291 with over $100,000 in ARR, up from 585 and 3,165 in the previous quarter.
Beyond top-line growth, Zscaler also made significant strides in operational efficiency. The company's adjusted operating margin improved substantially, widening by 200 basis points to 22% in Q2. This combination of revenue expansion and margin enhancement, partly offset by a 2% rise in total shares, translated into a 24% increase in earnings per share, which reached $0.78 for the quarter.
For Q3, Zscaler anticipates earnings of at least $0.75 per share on roughly $666 million in sales, surpassing Wall Street's expectations.
Zscaler’s stock, currently priced around $204, is trading at approximately 13 times its trailing revenues, slightly below its three-year average price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 16x. Despite the recent stock price appreciation, several fundamental factors suggest potential for further growth.
The company's robust performance indicators — including a strong revenue backlog, sequentially rising customer base, and improving profitability — justify a higher valuation multiple. Despite the recent 5% stock surge in the pre-market, the current valuation appears to have potential for additional growth. Zscaler's underlying business fundamentals continue to demonstrate resilience and strategic momentum in the competitive cloud-based cybersecurity market. Notably, the $227 average of analysts price estimate for ZS stock implies a P/S ratio of 15, and it reflects an upside potential of 10% after considering today's move.
While ZS stock navigates through higher sales and valuation, discover the potential of the High-Quality Portfolio, a curated list of 30 stocks that has consistently delivered superior returns compared to the S&P 500 over the past four-year period.

DaVita products may be unknown to most of you, yet the ownership structure could trigger your attention. And rightly so. Berkshire Hathaway - the conglomerate lead by the legendary investor Warren E. Buffett - holds more than 40% of the business. Let's find out why.
Beyond the guru holding structure, the company has a valid business model. As a leading provider of kidney care services, based in the US (Denver, Colorado) it can be a winner in the mounting tariffs war. Indeed the US imports more than two third of chemicals and pharmaceutical products from EU, Canada, Mexico and China, as per the US Census Bureau.
DaVita can benefit from this reduced competition and consolidate its position in the internal market.
The main business of DaVita is the chronic kidney disease (CKD) whose prevalence is rising globally.
as per the a joint statement published in Nature Reviews Nephrology from from leading societies in the field - the International Society of Nephrology, European Renal Association and American Society of Nephrology.
Aging populations and non-communicable diseases like diabetes and hypertensions are the main driver. Patients will need dialysis and other related services will grow and will need it for longer.
When evaluating US healthcare market, reimbursement is often top of mind. On this regard the nature of the dialysis services provides a degree of stability somehow higher than other healthcare sub-sectors. Recent policy changes, in particular focusing on preventive care, could further expand DaVita's addressable market, with earlier diagnosis of CKD.
DaVita's moat is very wide. Indeed it has a market share of more than 36% for dialysis services in the United States. In particular it provides in-center hemodialysis, home dialysis, and related services such as vascular access management, along with physician services and operating clinics. The company's extensive network of clinics (more than 3'000), coupled with its focus on quality care, have established it as a major player in the kidney care market. It's integrated care model, gives it a competitive advantage allowing to coordinate care across the different states of the nephropathy. Of note, DaVita operates primarily in the United States - averaging 90% of revenue from this geography as presented in the great chart below “How DaVita Makes Its Money”.
DaVita Inc Income Statement Breakdown Chart
In case of recession the business is unlikely to suffer wide downturn. DaVita's business model is indeed resilient due to the essential nature of its services. Demand for dialysis is relatively inelastic, meaning it is not significantly affected by economic downturns. This provides a degree of stability to DaVita's revenue streams.
DaVita has demonstrated ability to grow both its top and bottom lines. Yet the compounded annual growth rates (CAGR) are more typical of a mature business.
Revenues in the last 10 years changed for a total of 28.50%, aka CAGR of a modest 2.82%. A similar scenario is seen in the
 Earnings from Continuous Operation that yielded a 10-year CAGR of 11.19%, but there's a twitch. The starting year, fiscal year 2015, was not a great year, performance-wise. It brought in just $481 million while fiscal-year 2016 was much more in line with the trend at $1191 million hence yielding a adjusted total growth of just 5.79% going into the $1250 million earned in the most recent fiscal year. For context it is a slim CAGR of 0.54%. Nonetheless the growth was there thanks to increasing patient volumes and strategic expansion movements.
The company's balance sheet is generally healthy, although debt levels should be carefully considered. In particular the cash position is at $846 millions while the net debt position is $11'200 million (or 11.2 billion). Free cash flow generation is a strength for DaVita, positive during the past decade and allowing for reinvestment in the business, acquisitions, and potential share repurchases, as displayed in the chart below.
DaVita Inc Cash Flow Historical Chart
When it comes to valuation the company appears to be a little more than fairly valued. From my perspective the business has to be considered accounting for its big debt load. The best metric for that is enterprise value (EV) that has this simple formula: market cap - cash + total debt. It is the metric preferred to an investor willing to buy all the business, so he/she will gain all the cash the company has but he/she will also have to pay all the debt. DaVita has a market cap of $11.45 billion but an EV of $24.64 billion. This makes it look less attractive according the famous metric EV/Sales which stands at 1.9.
From a Price to Earnings (PE) point of view the company is better positioned than peers with a current PE of 13.1 and a forward PE of 12.9. Price to Earnings growth (PEG) ratio is also better-than-average at 1.02.
Profitability is indeed not a big issue for this company. If it is true that it can fluctuate due to changes in reimbursement rates and operating costs, DaVita has been profitable for the past 10 years. It maintained healthy percentages recently with gross margin of 32.9%, operating margin 15.2% and profit margin of 7.3%.
One of the strength of that is the possibility to have cash to reinvest. During the past decade DaVita decided to return it to shareholders. Not surprisingly, since Buffett is the largest owner, the company chose the most tax-efficient way: buying back shares. As presented in the chart below total number of share outstanding declined constantly hence increasing the percentage ownership of existing shareholders. The shareholder yield is 6.3%. This ratio is calculated as the percentage of net stocks repurchased relative to total market cap. A positive number indicates more shares repurchased by the company compared to those issued (e.g. stock options granted to management).
DaVita Inc Shares Buyback Chart
The primary risks facing DaVita include changes in government reimbursement rates, increased competition, and regulatory scrutiny.
DaVita receives about two thirds of US sales at government (primarily Medicare) reimbursement rates, with the remainder coming from commercial insurers. While commercial insurers represent only about 10% of the US patients treated, they represent nearly all of the profits generated by DaVita in the US dialysis business.
This niche market is not so much capital intensive, hence competition may increase in coming years. Yet the capillarity of the service offered and the quality of the treatments are well recognized by physicians that tend to stick whit what works. All in all it may be a decade before a serious contender can manifest.
Last but not least in the healthcare industry, litigation risks are always present and very hard to account for.
On a separate note it is worth noting that Buffett recently disclosed a trimming in its holding. On February 19, 2025, he sold 750,000 shares traded at a price of $154, which is a small yet relevant 2.1% trimming to its previous position of 35'892'479 shares in DaVita.
The company is one to keep an eye on, considering the moat it has in the niche of chronic kidney disease and the highly concentrated revenues billed within the US borders. It proved to be resilient during the past decade from a profitability angle, yet the top and bottom line growth rates yield some cautions when it comes to price. At the current multiples the company appears to be already more than fairly valued. The conclusion is that the recent trimming done by its biggest shareholder Buffett, has a solid rationale."

Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming various industries, and the stock market is no exception. From analyzing vast amounts of data to predicting market movements and automating decision making processes, AI is poised to revolutionize the way investors approach trading and investment strategies. Let's take a look at how AI can disrupt the stock market by facilitating decision making, automating investment choices, understanding market sentiment through social media and even helping investors build personalized portfolios based on risk levels.
The stock market has traditionally been driven by human intuition, fundamental analysis and technical indicators. However, AI is shifting this paradigm by introducing advanced algorithms that can process large volumes of real-time data in a fraction of the time it takes a human analyst to do the same. By utilizing machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP), AI can analyze complex patterns in stock prices, financial statements, economic indicators and even news articles to make predictions with higher accuracy than traditional methods.
One significant way AI is disrupting the stock market is through algorithmic trading. AI-powered algorithms can process massive amounts of market data and execute trades at lightning speed based on predefined criteria, identifying profitable opportunities in real time without human intervention.
A notable example is XTX Markets, a British trading firm founded by Alex Gerko. XTX utilizes AI and vast computing power to execute millions of trades daily, maintaining its edge through advanced AI models rather than speed alone. With £1.5 billion in profits and £250 billion in daily trades, XTX has become a globally significant firm in algorithmic trading.
Similarly, Tiger Brokers, supported by investors like Xiaomi and Jim Rogers, has integrated DeepSeek's AI model, DeepSeek-R1, into its AI-powered chatbot, TigerGPT. This adoption enhances market analysis and trading capabilities, allowing for improved data analysis, valuation and trading decision making for its customers.
AI's potential to revolutionize investment decision making is immense. Traditionally, investors have relied on financial reports, earnings statements and macroeconomic trends to guide their decisions. AI automates this process by sifting through vast amounts of structured and unstructured data to provide actionable insights in real time.
AI enhances decision making through sentiment analysis by evaluating social media platforms, news outlets and blogs to gauge market sentiment and investor mood, which often influence stock price fluctuations.
For instance, a Chinese research paper revealed that ChatGPT could effectively forecast the stock market and economy by analyzing news headlines from the Wall Street Journal spanning 1996 to 2022. ChatGPT's ability to predict an improving economic environment and stock market returns was statistically significant, outperforming the broader market.
Additionally, platforms like StockGeist.ai provide real-time sentiment analysis from social media comments and news articles for over 2,200 listed companies, enabling investors to understand prevailing sentiment trends and make informed decisions.
AI-powered platforms can offer personalized investment advice by analyzing an individual's financial goals, risk tolerance and past investment history. These platforms can automatically suggest stocks that align with the investor's preferences and current market conditions.
For example, AI-driven funds like Pictet's combine index tracking with machine learning to improve returns. While these funds aim to enhance performance, it's essential to note that AI, trained on past data, may lack the context of current events, potentially leading to unexpected performance. Therefore, human oversight remains crucial.
One of the most exciting prospects of AI in the stock market is the automation of investment decisions based on market sentiment. By tracking social media discussions, news articles and online forums, AI can assess the general mood of the market—whether optimistic, bearish or neutral. This real-time analysis helps investors adjust their portfolios accordingly.
For instance, AI can identify specific keywords, hashtags or phrases related to a company or industry to determine investor sentiment. If a particular stock gains traction due to positive reviews or favorable news reports, AI can automatically trigger an investment recommendation or trade execution. Conversely, if market sentiment turns negative, AI can quickly advise on portfolio adjustments, such as selling underperforming stocks or diversifying into other sectors.
By automating the investment decision process based on sentiment analysis, AI reduces human bias and emotional reactions, which are often detrimental to long-term investment strategies. Furthermore, this real-time response mechanism ensures that investors remain competitive in a fast-changing market environment, where delays can result in missed opportunities.
Another innovative application of AI in the stock market is using image recognition technology to identify stocks. Imagine being able to take a photo of a company's logo, product or advertisement and instantly receive detailed information about the company's stock performance, market trends and relevant news. AI image recognition systems can make this a reality.
Using machine learning algorithms, AI systems can scan and recognize company logos, products and advertisements in real time. Once an image is captured, the system can cross-reference it with a vast database of publicly available information to retrieve relevant stock data, including the company's stock price, earnings reports, latest news or even social media discussions related to that brand.
This technology can be particularly useful for investors who are on the go or those who prefer a more intuitive, visual approach to stock market research. Rather than manually searching for stocks, an investor could simply scan a product they are interested in and instantly receive a comprehensive overview of that stock's performance.
AI is profoundly disrupting the stock market by enhancing algorithmic trading, enabling sophisticated sentiment analysis, automating investment decisions and facilitating personalized portfolio management. As AI technologies continue to evolve, they offer investors powerful tools to navigate the complexities of modern financial markets, leading to more informed and strategic investment decisions.

Alibaba surgedon Thursday after the company made one of its artificial intelligence models public, a sign that the party isn't over for Chinese tech stocks.

        The e-commerce giant's Hong Kong shares jumped as much as 7.5% in Hong Kong after it made its QwQ-32B model public. Alibaba said that the model competes with DeepSeek's R1 — the AI startup's newest flagship model — in terms of performance while being more energy- and cost-efficient.
    

        Alibaba's shares in Hong Kong and its secondary listing in New York are up close to 70% so far this year. The company is worth $317.7 billion, much smaller than its US counterparts like Amazon, which has a market capitalization of $2.16 trillion.
    

        Last month, Alibaba's shares rose after a report said the company was working with Apple to roll out AI features for iPhones in China, news the companies later confirmed. The stock also jumped on news that Chinese leader Xi Jinping was meeting with the country's tech moguls.
    

        The share performance is part of a DeepSeek-propelled stock rally for Chinese tech firms, which are making a comeback after Beijing's yearslong crackdown on Big Tech. Investors saw Xi's meeting with tech leaders, including Alibaba founder Jack Ma, Tencent CEO Pony Ma, and electric vehicle maker BYD CEO Wang Chuanfu, asa sign he wants to revive the sector.
    

        Early last week, Alibaba announced plans to invest at least 380 billion Chinese yuan, or $53 billion, in cloud computing and AI infrastructure over the next three years. How much Big Tech companies are spending — part of their capital expenditure — is a hot topic, as some companies double down on AI-related investments.
    

        ""DeepSeek is driving Cloud capex in China,"" HSBC analyst Frank He wrote in a note last week.""We see that individual user demand has been growing, and the AI model has been increasingly deployed by enterprises and government entities.""
    

        Last month, Goldman Sachs analysts said that DeepSeek R-1 has altered the narrative of China tech. They added that the recent rally appears to be more sustainable compared to a September stimulus-driven spike that fizzled out in weeks because it is innovation-driven.
    

        On Thursday, Alibaba said its QwQ-32B model has one-fifth of the parameters compared to DeepSeek-R1, which means it is highly efficient. The model is now open-source on platforms including Hugging Face. Open-source models allow for the free and open sharing of software to anyone for any purpose.
    

        DeepSeek launched an open-sourced AI model in January, rattling US tech and AI companies. Third-party tests showed the model outperformed its peers from OpenAI, Meta, and other top developers, and the company said it was built for less money.
    

        The company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

MRNA Stock
 
Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) shares jumped 16% on Wednesday, March 5, following a favorable German court decision that determined BioNTech and Pfizer violated Moderna’s mRNA patents. Moderna is pursuing compensation based on all Comirnaty sales during the past three years. [1] Additionally, confidence among investors was bolstered by Moderna executives purchasing company stock.
After its recent rise, MRNA stock looks unattractive - making it a bad pick to buy at its current price of around $35. We believe there are several major concerns with MRNA stock, which makes it very unattractive given that its current valuation looks moderate.
  We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of MRNA stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Moderna along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a very weak operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below.
Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, MRNA stock is currently valued in line with the broader market.
Moderna's Revenues have fallen considerably over recent years.
Moderna's profit margins are considerably worse than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe.
Moderna's balance sheet looks very strong.
MRNA stock has seen an impact that was slightly better than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes.

In summary, Moderna's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows:
This isn’t appropriately reflected in the stock’s moderate valuation which is why we think it is very unattractive, which supports our conclusion that MRNA is a bad stock to buy.

  While you would likely do well to avoid MRNA stock for now, you could explore the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid- and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

DAL Stock 
Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) experienced a sharp 7% drop over the past week, markedly underperforming the S&P 500’s modest 2% pullback. The entire airline sector has come under significant pressure, with United Airlines falling 5%, American Airlines plunging 7%, and JetBlue retreating 4%.
 
The sector-wide decline is mainly due to two factors: heightened market volatility from the Trump administration’s new tariff implementations and rising trade tensions, combined with a crucial drop in U.S. consumer spending. Notably, recent economic indicators mark the first contraction in consumer spending in two years, sending ripples throughout the airline industry and dampening investor sentiment. [1]

Even though DAL stock has recently underperformed, it remains 76% above its early 2023 levels. This is primarily due to:
We will explore the details of these factors further. For more information, check out our dashboard on Why Delta Air Lines Stock Moved. Although DAL stock has enjoyed a strong run, if you prefer a smoother ride with upside potential compared to an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and achieved over 91% returns since inception.
Delta’s revenue growth has been largely driven by capacity expansion. The airline recorded a significant 24% increase in available seat miles, accompanied by modest gains in passenger yield (up 0.5%) and an impressive 150 basis point improvement in occupancy rate relative to 2022. Moreover, the company’s ancillary revenue streams proved resilient, with cargo and other sales growing 4% during the same period.
Following the pandemic lockdowns of 2020 and 2021, the aviation industry experienced a strong rebound in travel demand, with robust passenger traffic persisting in recent years. Nevertheless, the current economic environment poses new challenges. Ongoing inflationary pressures have eroded consumer confidence, which has declined for three consecutive months as of February [2]

Investors are growing increasingly concerned that any pullback in consumer spending could adversely affect airline revenues, with international routes being particularly vulnerable to demand fluctuations.
DAL Operating Income
Delta’s financial resurgence has boosted investor sentiment, telling a compelling story of growth and operational efficiency. The company has not only shown strong revenue growth but has also significantly improved its profitability. Between 2022 and 2024, Delta’s operating margin increased from 7.2% to 9.7%, highlighting strategic gains in cost management and operational performance, thanks to a fall in fuel prices.
These operational improvements directly lifted the bottom line, with adjusted earnings nearly doubling from $3.20 in 2022 to $6.16 in 2024. The rise in Delta’s price-to-sales ratio—from 0.4x in 2022 to 0.6x now—reflects the market’s positive view of its financial progress.
Delta’s stock is currently trading at $57, with a price-to-sales ratio of 0.6x, in line with its four-year average. There is a strong case for valuation multiple expansion, as recent trends show consumers' resilience in travel spending, keeping airline demand robust despite shifting economic indicators.
The airline industry has demonstrated notable strength, with U.S. corporate travel spending growing rapidly. Simultaneously, Delta has reinforced its financial position by reducing total debt from $31 billion in 2022 to $23 billion now, thereby enhancing its financial flexibility.
However, investors should be mindful of inherent risks, particularly from fuel prices. Since fuel costs account for roughly 20% of Delta’s operating expenses, any geopolitical tensions or market disruptions that drive fuel prices higher could directly impact the company’s profitability.
We estimate Delta Air Lines’ valuation at $77 per share, suggesting a potential 35% upside from current levels. We advise investors to consider this opportunity during the current market dip for long-term gains. The strategic blend of sustained travel demand, debt reduction, and operational efficiency positions Delta favorably in today’s market.
Although DAL stock might benefit from an upward revision in valuation, consider the High-Quality Portfolio, a carefully selected group of 30 stocks that has consistently outperformed the S&P 500’s returns over the past four years.

46,2025-03-06,"Skype was once a pioneering VoIP service, but Microsoft effectively killed it 10 years ago.
Skype was once a pioneering VoIP service, but Microsoft effectively killed it 10 years ago.
by  Tom Warren
Skype was Microsoft’s biggest-ever acquisition in 2011, a deal brokered by former CEO Steve Ballmer when the company was trying to compete with the rise of the iPhone. But after spending $8.5 billion on Skype, Microsoft dropped the ball again and again over the past 14 years, to the point where Skype was so irrelevant during a global pandemic that everyone used Zoom instead.
Skype has been relegated to a forgotten relic of an era before Google and Apple’s mobile dominance, and Microsoft is now laying it to rest alongside other failed mobile efforts like Windows Phone. It wasn’t always this way, though.
In early 2012, a few months after Microsoft’s acquisition, I visited the Skype offices in Stockholm that engineers had just moved into. Skype had just passed 41 million concurrent users, more than even Steam’s recent record. Skype was so popular at the time that people kept stealing the Skype signs outside its offices, so the company simply stopped replacing them.
Inside the Skype Stockholm office, I met engineers who were excited and nervous about Microsoft’s acquisition, but who had been reassured by a visit from Ballmer, who shook their hands and promised that Microsoft was investing in the team to double its size from 100 employees to 200 by the end of 2012. While that investment happened, Microsoft closed the Stockholm office five years later as it reorganized engineering teams.
The one thing that struck me from that visit was that Skype’s office felt nothing like a typical Microsoft office: there was no formal dress code, the walls were covered in special acoustics panels, and meetings were held over Skype’s network. Some Skype employees told me at the time that they were struggling to get used to the heavy use of email by Microsoft’s various teams. It was an early sign that integrating Skype into Microsoft’s way of working was going to be more challenging than just updating software.
In the early days of the Skype division at Microsoft, the team was focused on building a new version of Skype for a touch-friendly version of Windows. Rick Osterloh, former head of Skype products and design, told me during my 2012 visit that “Windows 8 is a big focus for us.” Osterloh, who now oversees Google’s devices and services efforts, left Skype just months after my visit and rejoined Motorola Mobility. Skype shipped a Windows 8 app the same year Osterloh left, with huge backend changes that were supposed to prepare it for a mobile future.
As Skype increasingly turned its focus to mobile, the problems with overhauling its aging peer-to-peer infrastructure started to emerge. Microsoft began migrating Skype users to its Messenger platform in 2012, which previously helped power MSN Messenger, to improve the ability to send chat messages and pick up calls on multiple devices. This transition lasted years and resulted in many bugs, including calls, messages, and notifications repeating on multiple devices. There were countless app redesigns, and basic problems with calling and messaging were becoming apparent. I wrote in 2016 that “Microsoft needs to fix Skype” after a painful couple of years of issues with the service.
Microsoft was too busy adding emoji and trying to compete with the rise of WhatsApp, FaceTime, Snapchat, and Facebook Messenger that it had fallen short on the very basics of Skype. It had gotten to the point, in 2016, where people were using Skype begrudgingly, simply because it was ubiquitous and nothing had replaced it yet.
Instead of addressing the many fundamental issues with Skype calling and messaging, Microsoft went ahead and introduced a radical redesign of Skype in 2017 that didn’t go down well. The layout looked nothing like Skype and resembled something more like Snapchat. Microsoft was forced to redesign Skype once again in 2018 and walk back the Snapchat-like changes, but it was too late. WhatsApp, Messenger, FaceTime, WeChat, Line, and Telegram had already become entrenched by then, offering easy video calls and reliable messaging.
I wrote in 2018 that it would be “difficult for Microsoft to now win back consumer trust when there are now so many reliable alternatives,” and that’s exactly what happened. Microsoft’s Skype struggles created a Zoom moment in early 2020, when the covid-19 pandemic forced everyone to use video and voice calls to connect with friends and family. Instead of heading to Skype, consumers picked Zoom for its ease of use and reliability.
In response, Microsoft quickly pivoted its consumer focus to Teams, launching a personal version in the middle of 2020. That’s what is slated to replace Skype in May. Teams doesn’t try to compete with WhatsApp, Messenger, or other chat apps; instead, it’s there for people who want to do more than just chat and is designed around groups of friends or family activities.
There’s no longer a Skype division inside Microsoft, and there hasn’t been for some time. What’s left of the Skype team has been combined with the Teams org and will work on future features of the app. 
Microsoft might have stumbled with Skype, but this acquisition helped bring Teams to life in 2016, and it even acted as a bridge to transition business users from its Lync enterprise messaging software to Skype for Business and, eventually, Teams. 
“It’s very much true that a lot of the learning from Skype and some of the code evolved into Teams,” said Jeff Teper, president of Microsoft 365 collaborative apps and platforms, in an interview with The Verge recently. “The calling and message infrastructure did evolve, on the backend, out of the Skype codebase. At this point the amount of code that’s different is extremely high, but there was definitely an evolutionary path of us learning how to do A/V calling.”
Now, we wait to see how Microsoft Teams will fare on the consumer side. While Teams has 320 million monthly users overall, the vast majority of those are business users. Teams is still a little clunky for personal use, despite the company moving to a single app for personal and work. None of my friends or family members actually use Teams outside of the office, but I get a sense that Microsoft might be fine with serving this smaller market. After all, Microsoft’s early experiences with Skype helped it build a communications platform that now makes its paid Microsoft 365 subscriptions even stickier.
MSN Messenger and Skype walked so Microsoft Teams could run, but given the amount of complaints I hear about Teams these days, I don’t know that Microsoft has moved past the issues it faced with Skype 10 years ago. I often run into issues joining Teams calls because of the complexities of switching tenants, or just because I’m using a personal Microsoft account and Teams gets confused. I also have two Teams icons in my system tray for some reason.
Compared to Slack, the messaging part of Teams is still very basic, although Microsoft is looking to address that with threads and combined chats and channels soon. There are plenty of areas for improvement with Teams, and while the faster and redesigned client is a good step in the right direction, it should be the foundation for bigger changes. The Teams complaints are growing — Microsoft will need to address them a lot faster this time if it wants to avoid another Skype situation.

The Best Buy in Montebello, California, on Black Friday, November 29, 2024. The annual Black Friday ... [+] shopping day has always been about finding the best deals, but this year retailers are preparing for a US consumer more zealously fixated than ever on getting value for their money. (Photo by ETIENNE LAURENT / AFP) (Photo by ETIENNE LAURENT/AFP via Getty Images)
 
Best Buy’s stock (NYSE: BBY) experienced an unexpected decline, dropping 13% on March 4, despite surpassing estimates in its fourth-quarter earnings report (ended Feb 1). This drop was considerably steeper than that of the broader market, where the S&P fell approximately 1.2% on the same day. The slump in Best Buy’s stock underscores the challenges in the consumer electronics retail sector, which is facing tough comparisons following a pandemic-driven sales surge. Rising inflation and the possibility of tariff-induced price increases have added to the uncertainty, casting a shadow over the retailer’s outlook. Concerns regarding profitability and consumer demand have emerged as key issues for investors as the company navigates a complex and rapidly evolving environment. Separately, see Inflation to Sink S&P 500, Brace For Impact?
Best Buy’s Q4’25 revenue decreased by 5% year-over-year to $13.95 billion. On the bottom line, the company’s earnings dropped significantly to $0.54 per share, compared to $2.12 per share during the same period last year. However, after adjusting for a non-cash goodwill impairment charge and other restructuring measures, Best Buy’s adjusted earnings reached $2.58 per share. A notable highlight of the quarter was the company’s comparable sales, which increased by 0.5% (in contrast to a 4.8% decline in Q4’24), excluding the additional week in fiscal 2024. This performance surpassed Best Buy’s guidance, which had predicted a change ranging from flat to a 3% decline. In the U.S., quarterly comparable sales demonstrated resilience, rising 0.2% year-over-year. If you are seeking upside with a smoother ride than that of an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and achieved over 91% returns since its inception.
The recent implementation of 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, along with a doubling of duties on Chinese goods to 20%, is expected to have substantial implications for Best Buy’s operations. Since China and Mexico are the company’s two largest supply chain sources, contributing approximately 55% and 20% of its products respectively, these tariffs are likely to increase costs for the retailer. Best Buy anticipates that its vendors will pass on some of the tariff costs to consumers, leading to higher prices for American shoppers. Notably, direct imports account for only 2-3% of its products.
Given Best Buy’s six-week inventory cycle, the company expects the pricing changes to take effect mainly during the Q2–Q4 period of the fiscal year. Consequently, investors should be prepared for potential effects on the company’s financial performance and consumer demand as the full impact of the tariffs and pricing adjustments unfolds.
The decline in BBY stock over the past four years has been inconsistent, although its annual returns were considerably less volatile than those of the S&P 500. The stock achieved returns of 4% in 2021, -17% in 2022, 3% in 2023, and 14% in 2024. In contrast, the Trefis Best Buy’s Revenues are forecast to reach $41.4 billion for fiscal 2026, and the Best Buy’s Valuation has been revised to $79 per share. As a result, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, which comprises 30 stocks, has been less volatile and has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four years. Why is this the case? Overall, the HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index, resulting in a less turbulent performance as shown by the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
Best Buy has been broadening its service offerings, particularly through Geek Squad and its health segment, to support product sales, improve margins, and enhance customer engagement. This strategy, along with expanded membership programs, has spurred growth by increasing gross margins to 22.6% for the full year of FY 2025 from 22.1% in the previous year. Additionally, its adjusted operating margins grew by 10 basis points to 4.2% during the same period. Strategic initiatives, such as expanding Best Buy Express in Canada and planning a U.S. marketplace launch, are expected to drive future growth.
Best Buy’s appliances division is encountering headwinds, as sluggish U.S. home sales and evolving consumer preferences dampen demand. This trend resulted in an 11.4% year-over-year decline in comparable appliance sales in the U.S. during Q4. In contrast, Best Buy’s international segment defied this trend by achieving a 4.9% increase in appliance sales for the fourth quarter.
For fiscal 2026, Best Buy has issued full-year guidance, projecting revenue between $41.4 billion and $42.2 billion (compared to $41.5 billion in FY 2025) and expecting comparable sales growth of 0% to 2% year-over-year. Notably, this guidance does not account for the potential impact of recent or proposed tariffs. Looking forward, Best Buy anticipates that consumer behavior will maintain the same resilience and caution observed in FY 2025, as persistent high inflation continues to drive up household expenses and encourage a discerning, value-focused approach to discretionary spending, particularly on big-ticket items.
We project Best Buy’s revenues to reach $41.4 billion for the full year 2026, marking a marginal year-over-year increase. Regarding profitability, we now forecast adjusted EPS of $6.23. In light of the revised revenue and earnings forecasts, we have updated our valuation of Best Buy to $79 per share, based on an expected EPS of $6.56 and a 12.0x P/E multiple for fiscal 2026 – nearly aligning with the current market price.
It is useful to observe how its peers compare. Review how Best Buy’s Peers perform on key metrics. Additionally, you can find other valuable comparisons for companies across various industries under Peer Comparisons.

A top Jack Daniel's executive isn't happy about how some Canadian provinces responded to President Donald Trump's tariffs.

        Ontario and New Brunswick instructed state-affiliated alcohol retailers this week to remove US-made alcohol from store shelves. The pulling of American alcohol was in response to Trump's 25% tariffs on Canadian goods.
    

        In a Wednesday earnings call, Lawson Whiting, the CEO of the parent company of Jack Daniel's, Brown-Forman, said he thought Canada's retaliation was ""worse than a tariff.""
    

        ""It's literally taking your sales away,"" Whiting said.
    

        ""That's a very disproportionate response to a 25% tariff,"" he added.
    

        Whiting also called it ""disappointing"" that some Canadians now couldn't buy Jack Daniel's because of the tariffs.
    

        ""We're going to see how that all plays out,"" Whiting said, adding that Canada was ""not a massive"" market for the company and made up ""around 1%"" of Brown-Forman's sales.
    

        Brown-Forman, which owns other spirit brands such as Old Forester and Glendronach, reported that net sales decreased by 3% in the quarter that ended on January 31 compared with the same period the year before.
    

        Brown-Forman's net sales in the quarter totaled $1.04 billion.
    

        The company also reported a 6% decrease in its net income in the latest quarter compared with the year before.
    

        The Liquor Control Board of Ontario, a government-run wholesaler of alcohol in Ontario, said on Tuesday that the state government had instructed it to ""immediately"" cease imports of US alcohol. It's also been told to stop selling American products.
    

        ""U.S. products will not be purchased by LCBO until the LCBO is directed to resume normal business,"" a news release on the LCBO's website said.
    

        The LCBO's annual sales from US alcohol products have been as high as $965 million, according to the board's news release.
    

        In a Wednesday Facebook post, the government of Canada's eastern province of New Brunswick said the province wouldn't be purchasing any new US alcohol products.
    

        It also said the products had been removed from the shelves of Alcool NB, a government-affiliated alcohol retailer. A video accompanying the post showed shelves in an Alcool NB store labeled ""United States"" wiped clean.
    

        Socit des Alcools du Qubec, a government-run alcohol retailer in Quebec, said in a Wednesday X post that it was wiping all US products from branches and its website ""at the request of the Qubec government.""
    

        In early February, Trump said he'd impose 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada. But those tariffs were delayed by a month after both countries promised to tighten their border security.
    

        The tariffs went into effect at 12:01 a.m. ET on Tuesday.
    

        In a statement on Monday, Canada's prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said the country would impose a retaliatory 25% tariff on $155 billion worth of American goods.
    

        Representatives for Brown-Forman didn't respond to a request for comment, sent outside regular business hours.

49,2025-03-06,Baird analysts are concerned that Wall Street is far too optimistic over Tesla’s first-quarter delivery numbers.
50,2025-03-06,Why some Wall Street analysts say Trump 2.0 isn't too concerned about a fall in the stock market just yet.
51,2025-03-06,"Costco (COST+0.97%) shoppers are on a bulk-buying spree, snapping up groceries, home furnishings and electronics, as the retailer defies growing concerns over rising tariffs and living costs.
The retail giant reported mixed second-quarter earnings on Thursday, March 6. Costco posted quarterly revenue of $62.53 billion, a 9% increase, though it fell short of analysts’ expectations, which had forecasted $63.11 billion, according to FactSet (FDS+0.03%). Same-stores sales increased by 6.8%, exceeding the anticipated 6.4%, while e-commerce sales surged by 20.9%. The stock slipped 2% in later afternoon trading. 
Despite the looming threat of President Donald Trump’s U.S. tariffs, Costco’s performance underscores its strong and unique position with American consumers, particularly wealthier shoppers. Competitors like Walmart, Target, and Best Buy have warned that prices on everyday items, including fruits, vegetables, and electronics, are likely to rise. 
Although Trump’s proposed tariffs have been paused – at least for now – the hikes would impose a 25% duty on imports from Mexico and Canada and  10%  on Chinese goods. 
In Dec. 2024, Costco CEO Gary Millerchip told investors the retailer was prepared to adapt should tariffs be imposed. “When it rains, it pours,” he said at the time, acknowledging the potential impact.
Unlike its rivals, Costco remains committed to offering bulk products at low prices. Last month, Hamilton “Tony” James, chairman of Costco, said the retailer was winning over wealthier shoppers, in part due to a selection of luxury items such as Rolex watches, gold bars, and Porches. 
Top selling items in the second quarter included jewelry, home furnishings, small electronics, and hardware. 
Known for its “treasure hunt” shopping experience, Costco focused on offering curated deals, James explained. Instead of stocking shelves with 120,000 items typically found at Walmart (WMT+1.10%), Costco offers a more streamlined selection of 3,400 items. Its private label, Kirkland Signature, was among the top sellers in 2024, as consumers increasingly opted for more affordable options to better manage high grocery prices. 
Costco has also made headlines for its strong stance on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). Unlike many rivals, the company has doubled down on its  DEI initiatives. In January, Costco rejected the use of quotas, opting instead to offer equal opportunities to its 300,000 employees.

Miskolc, Hungary - May 20, 2018: Spotify starting up on an iPhone 8 connected to a new Skoda car.
In a recent meeting with clients, I used my reverse DCF model to quantify the future revenue and cash flow expectations in Spotify (SPOT) at $622 per share. The results astounded me, and I think they will astound you.
The point of this report is to show you how to identify a stock that has likely seen its best days; so you can avoid losing money and start looking for stocks that will make you money.
First, let me show you how much downside risk is in a stock as hyped up as Spotify.
As I do for all of my Reverse DCF Case Studies, I use my valuation models to quantify the future performance of the company required to justify the stock price.
Specifically, my model shows that to justify ~$622/share Spotify would have to:
Let’s put some context around those expectations.
First, growing revenue at a 28% CAGR for 15 years means Spotify revenue would be $562 billion in 2039, which is greater than Apple’s trailing twelve months (TTM) revenue. TTM values are as of as of February 3rd, 2025 when I pulled the report from my firm’s database. $560 billion in revenue is lower than only Amazon’s (AMZN) TTM revenue at $620 billion (#2 in the S&P 500) and Walmart’s (WMT) TTM revenue at $674 billion (#1 in the S&P 500). See Figure 1 for details.
Figure 1: Comparing Spotify’s Revenue and ROIC to top Companies in the S&P 500
Comparing Spotify Revenue & ROIC to Top Companies
It is important to note that the stock price embeds expectations for revenue reaching $560 billion while Spotify – also – increases its to 2,412%.
For reference, the highest ROIC in the S&P 500 is ~450%. No S&P 500 company has achieved an ROIC higher than 600% in the last 5 years. Yet, Mr. Market is projecting that Spotify will increase its ROIC to 2412%. Seems like a high expectation for any business.
Based on global data and business intelligence firm, Statista, the worldwide market for “Music, Radio & Podcasts” will be $124.8 billion in 2025. Statista expects the market to grow at a 3.23% CAGR through 2029 and reach $141.7 billion. If I assume the worldwide market grows at 3.23% until 2039, it would reach $195 billion, or just 35% of $560 billion, the 2039 revenue for Spotify implied by its current stock price. In other words, Spotify’s stock price at $622/share implies it will own 287% of the worldwide market for “Music, Radio & Podcasts” in 2030. See Figure 2.
Figure 2: Spotify’s Market Share Must Grow from 15% to 287% to Justify $622/share.
Spotify Implied Market Share Analysis
I think there are several reasons why the expectations embedded in Spotify’s current stock price are too high.
Large revenue growth, like what’s embedded in Spotify’s stock price, implies quite significant market share gains per Figure 2. Note that market share gains are typically won with lower prices, which are not possible with a company that must also increase its ROIC to very high levels.
In other words, Spotify’s stock price is implying a doubly-incredible future where the company achieves huge revenue growth and ROIC increases as well.
Whenever stocks get super expensive, it is only a matter of time before they fall back to earth as the law of competition inevitably proves the expectations for future cash flows to be overly optimistic.
Too few investors have the tools to unveil the details behind stock valuations. I make it clear and easy. Math is math. Valuation is not supposed to be hard. Wall Street wants to keep you in the dark by making you think it is too hard to get the truth about valuation.
My firm sheds light into the dark corners of the market and make them into opportunities to win not get lose money.
I think the MOMO, YOLO, SPAC, NFT, meme stock and meme coin trading ploys are bad for investors, bad for our stock market, and bad for our country. I’m here to give you proven-superior investment research that is good for the long-term health of your portfolio and your peace of mind.

E-commerce giant JD.com (JD US, 9618 HK) reported Q4 financial results post-the Hong Kong close/pre-US market open that beat analyst expectations. JD Retail revenue increased 14.7% for the quarter and 7.5% for the year. The company noted the “increasing demand” for electronics and home appliances for
The heads of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), CSRC (China’s SEC), PBOC, Ministry of Finance (MoF), and Ministry of Commerce (MoC) held a press conference during the 14th National People’s Congress. This press conference went very well, as we experienced a few underwhelmed post-September stimulus press conferences. This one overwhelmed me! The lack of Western media coverage shows how well it went! Below are summaries of their statements.
Asian equities had a strong night, led by Hong Kong and Mainland China, as numerous countries posted +1% returns, though Taiwan, Australia, Malaysia, and Thailand were off. As my colleague Kyle succinctly said, “The world’s second-largest economy is stimulating.”
Hong Kong and the Mainland market had high volumes and strong breadth (i.e. advancers versus decliners). The most-traded Hong Kong-listed stock overnight was Tencent, which gained +7.62%, trading HKD 42 billion today, which is 10X the pre-stimulus levels. 10X! The NPC press conference's consumption and tech/AI focus were a key catalyst.
Alibaba gained +8.39% after announcing its QwQ-32B model had “comparable performance” to DeepSeek. In China, there was a lot of talk about a new AI player named Manus, who claimed to have even stronger performance than OpenAI.
The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech indexes gained +3.29% and +5.40%, respectively, on volume that increased +45.79% from yesterday, which is 242% of the 1-year average. 403 stocks advanced, while 96 declined. Main Board short turnover increased by +35.92% from yesterday, which is 229% of the 1-year average, as 14% of turnover was short turnover (Hong Kong short turnover includes ETF short volume, which is driven by market makers’ ETF hedging). The growth factor and large caps outperformed the value factor and small caps. The top-performing sectors were Communication Services, which gained +7.44%, Consumer Discretionary, which gained +6.04%, and Real Estate, which gained +4.38%. Meanwhile, the worst-performing sector was Utilities, which fell -0.31% and was the only negative sector. The top-performing subsectors were consumer services, media, and software. Meanwhile, construction materials, steel, and coal were among the worst-performing subsectors. Southbound Stock Connect volumes were high. Mainland investors bought +$840 million worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs, led by Xiaomi, Kuaishou, China Mobile, and Alibaba were large net buys; Li Auto, a small net buy; Tencent, SMIC, Meituan small net sales; CNOOC Finance, a moderate net sell.
Shanghai, Shenzhen, and the STAR Board gained +1.17%, +1.81%, and +3.48%, respectively, on volume that increased +27.65% from yesterday, which is 164% of the 1-year average. 4,229 stocks advanced, while 763 stocks declined. The growth factor and large caps outperformed the value factor and small caps. The top-performing sectors were Communication Services, which gained +3.62%, Information Technology, which gained +3.14%, and Real Estate, which gained +2.47%. Meanwhile, Utilities fell -0.55% and made up the only negative sector. The top-performing subsectors were internet services, software, and cultural media. Meanwhile, highways, banking, and motorcycles were among the worst-performing subsectors. Northbound Stock Connect volumes were above average. CNY and the Asia Dollar Index both fell versus the US dollar. Treasury bonds fell. Copper and steel rose.

Stock markets in the U.S. opened sharply lower on Thursday amid mounting investor concerns about slowing economic growth and uncertainty over the impact of new Trump administration tariffs on Canada, China and Mexico. 
The S&P 500 fell 104 points, or 1.8%, to close at 5,739, while the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrials Average slid 1% on the day and tech-heavy Nasdaq composite tumbled 2.6%.
Recent signals suggest the economy is weakening. Most worrying is a downturn in spending by American consumers, with federal data showing that retail sales across the U.S. dipped 0.9% in January. 
The job market is also cooling down, while layoffs in February soared to their highest level since July 2020, according to new numbers from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. 
At the same time, inflation accelerated in January and remains stubbornly above the Federal Reserve's 2% annualized target. Recent economic trends have sparked fears that the U.S. could be headed for a rare bout of ""stagflation,"" or when the economy and the job market slow at the same time inflation rises. The country hasn't faced such a period of economic distress since the late 1970s and early 1980s.
Investors are also fretting about a budding global trade war. The Trump administration on Tuesday announced 25% tariffs on U.S. imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 10% levy on Chinese imports, which were already taxed at 10%. 
The barrage of trade measures has raised concerns of higher prices in the U.S. for a range of goods, such as produce and cars. Stocks continued to nose down Thursday despite President Trump signing executive orders suspending the tariffs on Canada and Mexico until April 2.
""Bearish sentiment is at a historical extreme over concerns of economic growth, trade wars and Trump 2.0 policies,"" Piper Sandler analysts said in a report.
Trump had previously delayed the tariffs on the U.S.' northern and southern neighbors before ultimately moving forward, and he is forging ahead with with other tariffs scheduled to take effect April 2.
""Much will depend on whether these new tariffs prove temporary or are toned down,"" according to strategists at BNP Paribas. ""But even if they are ultimately removed, we anticipate lasting damage to global economic activity.""

FWIW, I have been using the first generation K10 (with brown switches) for the past three years and absolutely love it. I wish they could add Touch ID to it (since my laptop is always in clamshell), but it’s otherwise just about perfect.

I was given a Keychron K10 Pro as a gift. Overall I love it. The downsides are no Touch ID and no option for backlit characters on the keys instead of between the keys. Also there seems to be no quick start guide or even a manual for key customization – just a webpage without much explanation beyond trial and error.

Pretty sure Keychron sells replacement keycaps that have shine-through characters as an option. Or, there are likely third party shine-through or translucent caps. The TouchID problem isn't solvable, but one of the advantages of a mechanical, switch-based keyboard is everything else can be changed.

This willful ignorance allows us to get by and curb our warranted suspicions about the job role. Is it a good idea to curb our judgment? Probably not. Do we do it anyway and wait until the first day to make a judgment call? Yep.

62,2025-03-06,"Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump joined the advisory board of Dominari Holdings in February and acquired stakes in the company, sending its stock soaring—but filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and online searches reveal little evidence of the advisory board before their appointments.

On Feb. 11, an hour before the stock market opened, Dominari Holdings—which specializes in wealth management, investment banking, sales and trading, asset management and capital investment—announced Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump had joined its advisory board and acquired an undisclosed number of shares, sending shares to a 52-week high of $11.33 that day and a peak of $13.58 two days later.
But between June 10, 2021, when the company was named AIkido Pharma, and Feb. 12, 2025, the day after the Trumps’ involvement was announced, Dominari Holdings did not submit a filing to the SEC that mentioned an advisory board or board of advisors, except for references in the chief operating officer’s bio stating he had been a member for three months in 2022.
An online search failed to provide evidence of the advisory board’s prior existence: it is not mentioned on any website—including Dominari Holdings’ own—prior to Feb. 11, in a search on Google.
Dominari Holdings also did not file its advisory board agreement with the SEC until Feb. 12, a day after announcing the Trumps’ membership.
Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and spokespeople for Dominari Holdings did not respond to inquiries.
“Anybody should know this is political patronage. This is not the purchase of expertise,” said Alan Palmiter, a professor who specializes in corporate law and securities regulation at Wake Forest University who reviewed the company’s SEC filings at Forbes’ request.
It can vary. Unlike a board of directors, which has specific legal and management responsibilities, an advisory board’s duties depend on the company’s needs. The template for an advisory board agreement that Dominari Holdings filed with the SEC on Feb. 12 states that its members “advise the company with respect to matters related to the field and/or other business-related matters”; consult on other suitable members of the advisory board; and review opportunities, proposals and plans. (Members of the advisory board in 2021, when Dominari Holdings was named AIKido Pharma, were all scientists.)
It remains unclear how much Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump will earn through their roles. According to the template, Dominari Holdings compensates advisory board members with an unspecified number of shares upon joining, as well as additional shares when the company’s market capitalization reaches $50 million, $100 million and $150 million. (As of Thursday’s close, Dominari’s market cap stood at $42 million.)
Ronald Lieberman, who appears to be the only other current advisory board member identified in Dominari Holdings’ SEC filings, received 150,000 unrestricted shares on Feb. 18 for his work on it. Dominari Holdings also paid him $3,551 in cash in 2024 for that role. Lieberman is an executive vice president at the Trump Organization, where he has worked since 2007. And he is on Domiari Holdings’ board of directors, having joined in December 2024.
966,000: the number of Dominari Holdings shares Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump each own, representing 6.7% of the company’s outstanding shares, according to SEC filings they made on Feb. 24. They each also hold warrants to obtain another 432,000 shares. The Trumps’ SEC filings, however, do not disclose when they began acquiring their shares, how they obtained all of them (such as through public markets, private placements or as compensation for joining the advisory board) or the price paid. The brothers did purchase at least some of the shares in a private sale though, according to a company press release.
“Their guidance is expected to be instrumental as we continue to seek attractive investment opportunities, particularly in the rapidly evolving AI and data center sector,” said Dominari Holdings president Kyle Wool in a statement announcing Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump’s spots on the advisory
The extent of Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump’s experience in the AI and data center sector is unclear.
Dominari Holdings is headquartered in Trump Tower. The company pays the Trump Organization $747,000 in annual rent, reported independent journalist Wendy Siegelman.
Keep an eye on the company’s stock price. It doubled in the days following news of the Trumps’ involvement but has since slid, closing at $6.69 on Thursday.
Trading volume for Dominari Holdings Inc. soared ahead of the February announcement that the Trumps had taken stakes in the company and joined its advisory board—an increase that some securities law experts called “suspicious.”
In November 2024, Forbes estimated Donald Trump Jr.’s net worth at $50 million, while valuing Eric Trump at approximately $40 million.

My social media feeds have been flooded with colleagues, associates and friends who lost federal jobs because they were relatively new hires or recently promoted. Deadlines loom for agencies to submit further reductions. As a leader within the weather, water and climate enterprise, I have a strong desire to do more than say I’m sorry to my colleagues. As I reflect on my career as a scientist, here are some hidden job market skills most scientists likely have already have in their “toolbox"" that could help in their job searches.
I write this from a weather and climate perspective, but the points are transferable to other STEM disciplines. Both the American Meteorological Society and the federal government provide clear guidelines to become a meteorologist. Required coursework is steeped in advanced mathematics, physics, computer programming, statistics, atmospheric chemistry and climate. Many students are surprised at the rigor of the typical atmospheric sciences or meteorology curriculum. It’s definitely more than cold fronts, clouds, storm chasing and pulling up the latest Euro model run.
Like most scientific disciplines, scientists have likely taken elective classes. These might include coursework or certifications related to environmental sciences, communication studies, water, energy, disaster management, agriculture, public health and so on. Increasingly, I encourage students to gain as much as exposure as possible to computational programming, geographic information systems, geospatial analysis, data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, visualization and broader communication skills.
In addition to the obvious curriculum exposure, scientists have several attributes that are valuable to any organization. I was a scientist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center for more than 10 years. During my tenure there, I also became deputy project scientist for the Global Precipitation Measurement mission. As a part of the GPM scientific leadership team, I interacted with engineers, computer engineers, communication specialists, administrators, policymakers and stakeholders.
This leads me to hidden skillsets that scientists have likely acquired that would be valuable to any institution, industry or organization. These include working as a team, critical thinking, data and statistical analysis, the ability to solve problems, managing complex or detailed tasks and communicating findings. Scientists are typically comfortable in environments that require innovative thinking, methodology and data.
In 2017, AAAS explored what skills industry needs. Maggie Kuo wrote about a cohort of new hires at the Dow chemical company. “When asked what skill they spent the most time developing when they joined Dow, the most popular response was project management, including working in a team and delivering on schedule and on budget,” she said. They also mentioned leadership, networking and knowing the business side of research. Kuo pointed to additional resources for leaving research labs and developing broader skillsets. She also noted that many STEM graduate programs struggle to provide these broader skillsets.
For years, I have preached the need to train STEM graduate students to be end-to-end scientists. We do a great job training new scientists to conduct research, write papers, print posters and present at conferences. Graduate programs must preserve aspects of that model while incorporating internship or experiential learning opportunities, media training, public speaking, broader writing skillsets, project management and entrepreneurship. The Integrative Conservation Doctoral program at the University of Georgia incorporates many of these principles.
As scholars, we should not assume that our graduate students are hopping on the academic treadmill of postdoctoral researcher or faculty member. Don’t get me wrong, those are great options. After all, I am a faculty member. However, I have always approached the training of my graduate students with the assumption they may work at a university, federal agency, company, state or local government or a non-profit.
There are increasingly opportunities on college campuses or after graduation to test the waters of entrepreneurship. After all, STEM research is often quite innovative. The problem I see is that most young scientists have no idea how to navigate that pathway. My alma mater Florida State University recently developed a STEM entrepreneurship program. In 2024, the NSF Innovation in Graduate Education program funded projects to spur entrepreneurship in STEM. These are great starts.

Nothing at home, at work or in the market has felt normal since early March 2020, just a couple of weeks before the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. Five years later, we’ve still not established a “new normal” that reflects a sense of stability, especially for businesses and how they scale.
The calculus for global market entry is as complex as ever and seems to be evolving with every new U.S. news cycle. For years, market expansion was treated as a growth problem rather than a complexity problem. A company gained traction in one market, raised capital and entered another. There was little need to be deliberate because speed, not precision, was the primary concern. If something didn’t work, more funding could fix it.
That era is long gone.
The combination of high interest rates, geopolitical instability and increased investor scrutiny has shattered the illusion that market entry is simply a matter of moving fast and iterating later. Expansion is now a question of strategic endurance, not just ambition. Companies that continue to treat it as a formulaic process will soon find themselves retreating at a loss.
It’s a familiar pattern. A startup emboldened by early success enters a new market with the assumption that product-market fit will travel. It rarely does. The nuance of local demand, pricing sensitivities and competitive positioning is lost in the rush to scale. Expansion is not a matter of exporting success; it is a process of reestablishing viability under entirely new conditions.
Yet many companies still behave as if market entry is a growth lever rather than a risk calculation. Expansion failures are often treated as execution missteps when, in reality, they are leadership failures—failures of strategic judgment, internal communication and operational discipline.
The most common mistake is hiring a sales lead as a first local hire, an approach predicated on the belief that early revenue signals traction. It does not. Sales are an outcome of market fit, not a substitute for it. Without operational infrastructure, customer support and localized marketing, sales teams are set up to fail. Revenue might arrive, but it won’t last.
Misalignment at the executive level often compounds the mistake. Sales and operations leaders rarely speak the same language when it comes to expansion. Sales leadership is often focused on short-term revenue targets, while operational teams understand that market entry requires long-term infrastructure. If corporate leadership isn’t aligned on this reality, the result is an expansion effort driven by sales urgency rather than strategic readiness.
The second miscalculation is assuming that the macroeconomic environment is merely an external factor rather than a determinant of strategy. There was a time when capital was cheap enough to compensate for expansion inefficiencies. That time has passed. The shift from an era of near-zero interest rates to one of financial discipline (even austerity) has changed the equation. Expansion has stopped being a matter of securing the next round of funding to fuel growth. Now, it’s all about ensuring that growth justifies its own costs.
Geopolitical complexity just deepens the challenge. Startups once treated political risk as an afterthought, assuming that regulatory stability was the default. Since 2016, that assumption has been proven wrong. Trade policies, supply chain disruptions and regulatory shifts now exert direct pressure on expansion strategies. What was once a stable business environment can shift overnight. Companies that ignore this reality don’t just risk operational inefficiencies.
Market entry missteps also come with a reputational cost. A failed expansion isn’t just a financial setback. It damages investor confidence, weakens a company’s employer brand and signals instability to potential partners. Customers and competitors don’t forget a market retreat. Leadership must recognize that expansion is a brand decision as much as a business decision. Entering a market prematurely and then pulling back hurts revenue projections and undermines credibility.
If companies are operating in an unpredictable world, their approach to expansion must reflect that. That means instead of assuming that conditions will remain favorable, leadership has to engage in rigorous scenario planning. Before the idea of entering a market becomes an action, executives should already have assessed geopolitical risks, modeled worst-case economic conditions and defined clear exit strategies. Expansion should not be a leap of faith but a calculated move with contingencies in place.
The fundamental mistake in market entry today is assuming that expansion is a function of execution rather than adaptation. It is neither a checklist nor a process that scales predictably from one market to the next. It is an exercise in managing complexity under conditions of high uncertainty and finite resources.
Sometimes, it starts with a simple understanding that a sales cycle is longer and more complex than that of the home market. You’d be surprised by how many times I’ve heard executives are shocked at how long a sales cycle is way after the company has established an office and onboarded head count.
The companies that will succeed in 2025 are not those that expand the fastest. The ones that stick the landing will be those that recognize expansion as a strategic burden, one that demands discipline, patience and the ability to operate in an environment where the cost of failure is no longer subsidized by endless funding.
Startups that fail to adjust to this new reality will spend the next two years learning what many others already have: The price of treating market entry as an afterthought is an expensive exit.

That crazy expensive Arc Pulse thing/case we reviewed back in January turned out to be quite the hit for the Pixel 9 series. Shortly after sharing that it was available, followed by a bit of a review, all versions of it sold out and none have been available for purchase since. As of this moment, you can once again place a pre-order with estimated ship dates shown the day you place the order. If you were wanting an Arc Pulse Pixel 9 case, your chance to own one is back.
To recap, the Arc Pulse is a two-piece attachment for phones that acts like a case while allowing your phone’s design to still shine through. So it gets you the best of both worlds in terms of enjoying your phone and having some protection. It fits around the top and bottom of a phone to provide drop coverage and lifts a device from surfaces that you may set it down on. The Arc Pulse is made of high-quality metals too, so it typically costs much more than a regular case and feels premium in the hand.
The Arc Pulse comes in two sizes, one that fits the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro, as well as another that fits the Pixel 9 Pro XL. You’ll find two metal finishes of Matte Black or Silver, which are priced at $69.99 and $89.99, respectively.
As of today, pre-orders for the Matte Black version are showing a mid-April ship date, while the Silver version is earlier in April.
Are you thinking that this thing looks ridiculous and is insanely overpriced? I get why you might think that at first, but as someone who bought one and took it for a spin, I can tell you that this thing is still attached to my Pixel 9 Pro and I absolutely love it. It has given me new places to grip the device as I pull it in and out of a pocket, feels surprisingly nice in the hand, and actually looks pretty cool, at least to me. I love this thing, even at this price.

71,2025-03-06,"The world’s richest man Elon Musk, who doubles as President Donald Trump’s chief of cost-cutting, took a sizable hit to his net worth as the stock market shudders at Trump’s tariffs, causing shares of Musk’s multinational car company Tesla to flounder.
Elon Musk at the Oval Office last month.
Musk’s net worth fell by $8.8 billion Thursday to $342.8 billion, according to Forbes’ real-time estimates.
Musk’s fortune is now down $121.2 billion from its end-of-day record of $464 billion set Dec. 17, when Tesla stock closed at an all-time high $480 per share.
Down 6% on the day, Tesla stock closed at just above $263, some 45% below its end-of-day record set late last year.
Tesla ended Thursday trading at its lowest share price since Election Day.
The Tesla slump came as the S&P 500 fell 1.8% to a 2025 low as Trump’s tariffs on Canada, China and Mexico ate into investor sentiment.
Musk remains by far the richest person on Earth, leading No. 2 Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta, by more than $120 billion.
To put the $121 billion Musk lost in perspective, the 10th-wealthiest person on the planet, former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, has an estimated net worth of $118.9 billion in total. Asia’s wealthiest person, India’s Mukesh Ambani, has an $89.8 billion fortune.
4.8%. That’s how much Tesla shares were up from Election Day to Thursday, a fraction of the 91% rally they enjoyed through Dec. 17. Tesla’s initial post-election surge came as Wall Street bet Musk’s near $300 million donation toward Trump and GOP election efforts would translate into a big win for Tesla, which would especially benefit from lighter regulation for its self-driving initiatives. Musk is still $78 billion wealthier than he was on Election Day, benefiting in part from higher valuations for his private companies SpaceX and xAI.
Tesla is particularly sensitive to tariffs as China is the second-largest market for its electric vehicles and the company, like other American automakers, relies on imports from Canada to produce its cars. Tariffs “will have an impact on our business and profitability” considering Tesla is “still very reliant on parts from across the world for all our businesses,” Tesla’s chief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja warned in January. Musk is arguably the most important member of Trump’s administration as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
“Musk's involvement with DOGE and the Trump administration broadly may affect some buyers in the US and Europe, which complicates the setup from a demand perspective,” Baird analyst Ben Kallo wrote in a Thursday note to clients.

72,2025-03-06,"Donald Trump plans to revoke the legal status of some 240,000 Ukrainian refugees, Reuters reported Thursday. 
A senior Trump official and three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that the Trump administration intended to target Ukrainians welcomed under President Joe Biden’s parole programs, who’d fled their country amid Russia’s invasion. 
The move could be expected as soon as April, according to Reuters. 
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt denied the report shortly after it was published. “This is more fake news from Reuters based on anonymous sources who have no idea what they are talking about,” Leavitt wrote on X. “The truth: no decision has been made at this time.”
U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told Reuters that her agency had no announcements at this time.
In January, Trump signed an executive order terminating “all categorical parole programs that are contrary to the policies of the United States established in my Executive Orders,” including humanitarian parole programs helping migrants fleeing from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela.
Apparently, plans to place Ukrainian refugees on the fast-track to deportation were in the works before the talks between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy detonated last week, following an explosive meeting in the Oval Office.
During the meeting, Trump and Vice President JD Vance barely let Zelenskiy get a word in, both clearly incensed after the Ukrainian president tried to remind them that Russia didn’t always keep its word about ceasefires.
The U.S. president has since questioned Zelenskiy’s commitment to “peace,” even though he was the one to blow up during the meeting. Zelenskiy has since said the meeting was “regrettable,” and that it was “time to make things right.”
During Trump’s address to Congress Tuesday night, he read a letter from Zelenskiy stating that his country was “ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians.” 
Zelenskiy wrote that he was willing to sign an “agreement on minerals and security,” which has become a key feature in negotiations, as Trump hopes to recoup the billions in aid provided to Ukraine by the U.S.
Meanwhile, Trump has demanded absolutely nothing from Russian President Vladimir Putin, the “bad guy” who ordered the deadly and destructive invasion into Ukrainian territory, simply saying that he had received “strong signals” Russia was ready for peace. 
But Trump has already started taking his petty revenge against the wartime president for his supposed show of disrespect. On Monday, he suspended military aid to Ukraine, in defiance of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, in which the U.S. agreed to defend Ukraine’s borders in return for Kyiv’s surrender of nuclear weapons. The White House has also ordered a pause on intelligence sharing with Kyiv. 
It’s clear that Trump is interested in making Zelenskiy beg for help, and in return, maybe he’ll see a reward from Russia—or maybe not.

Democratic firebrand Representative Jasmine Crockett went after her Republican colleagues Wednesday for holding a sham hearing about crime in sanctuary cities. 
During the hearing before the Republican-led House Oversight Committee, in which four Democratic mayors defended their cities’ immigration polices, the Texas Democrat called out Republicans over their hypocritical focus on so-called migrant crime. 
“I know that many of you prepared for today’s hearing by making sure that you got a little bit of information about immigrants and crime in your cities. Let me ask each of the mayors, just yes or no,” Crockett said. 
“Have any of you been made aware of any immigrant that has had 34 felony convictions … that has still been able to roam in your cities?” she asked. 
Each of the four mayors predictably answered, “No,” or said nothing, and so Crockett continued. 
“I’m just curious because we are so concerned about crime, and I know that my Republican colleagues would never want anybody with 34 felony convictions roaming around, because that could be a danger to the community,” she said.
Crockett has been known for stirring the pot among her Republican colleagues, and was one of the Democratic lawmakers to walk out on Trump’s address to Congress on Tuesday night. 
The mayors who testified Wednesday were Mike Johnston of Denver, Brandon Johnson of Chicago, Michelle Wu of Boston, and the embattled Eric Adams of New York, who recently agreed to walk back certain measures protecting undocumented immigrants after the Department of Justice moved to drop his public corruption indictment, leading to allegations there had been a quid pro quo agreement. Adams continued to deny those claims Wednesday.
Boston Mayor Michelle Wu slammed Republican lawmakers for harming millions of Americans as she defended her city’s immigration policies at a House Oversight Committee hearing on sanctuary cities Wednesday.
In one particular exchange, Republican Representative Paul Gosar pressed Wu on federal immigration laws taking priority over local ones.
“Respectfully, Congressman, you could pass bipartisan legislation, and that would be comprehensive immigration law,” she replied.
“If you wanted to make us safe, pass gun reforms, stop cutting Medicaid, stop cutting cancer research, stop cutting funds for veterans. That is what will make our city safe,” she added as Gosar rolled his eyes.
She praised her city’s health care, low crime rates, higher education, and winning sports teams.
“We are the cradle of democracy and the city of champions. We are all of these things, not in spite of our immigrants but because of them,” Wu said.
The Boston mayor testified alongside the Democratic mayors of New York City, Denver, and Chicago, all of which are sanctuary cities, or jurisdictions with policies that limit information sharing with federal law enforcement to protect undocumented immigrants from deportation or prosecution. There are more than 600 sanctuary jurisdictions nationwide.
James Comer, the chair of the House Oversight Committee, and other Republicans, accused each city of putting its residents at risk and failing to comply with Donald Trump’s mass deportation plan. Comer is currently leading an investigation into sanctuary cities and their impact on federal immigration enforcement.
“Sanctuary cities make us all less safe and are a public safety nightmare,” Comer said at the hearing. “We cannot let pro-criminal alien policies of obstructionist sanctuary cities continue to endanger American communities and the safety of federal immigration enforcement officers.”
The attack on sanctuary jurisdictions is part of Trump’s larger war on immigration. On his first day in office, the president signed an executive order that included a directive to end federal funding to sanctuary jurisdictions. The order also threatens criminal investigation of any local official who does not assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.
Despite clear hostility from Republican lawmakers at the hearing, the Democratic mayors did not back down.
“We know there are myths about these laws. But we must not let mischaracterizations and fearmongering obscure the reality that Chicago’s crime rates are trending down,” said Brandon Johnson, the mayor of Chicago.
Denver Mayor Mike Johnston added that Denver’s crime rates went down when the city’s immigration population increased.
And, as Wu pointed out, much of the danger to Americans right now is coming from Republicans themselves, not the people they’re trying to deport.
“This federal administration is making hardworking, tax-paying, God-fearing residents afraid to live their lives,” Wu said. “A city that’s scared is not a city that’s safe. A land ruled by fear is not the land of the free.”
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt threw a tantrum Wednesday, as she floundered trying to explain Donald Trump’s tariffs.
During a press conference, Leavitt attempted to use the issue of fentanyl smuggling over America’s northern border to justify the president’s 25 percent tariffs on Canadian goods, but her explanation quickly fell apart. 
“There’s been more than a 2,000 percent increase in illegal fentanyl seizure at the northern border. Why? Because Canada is allowing that fentanyl to come to the United States,” Leavitt said. 
She added that the president sought “repercussions” for the deaths of American citizens who died of fentanyl overdoses. 
“But Karoline, respectfully, it’s just 43 pounds that were found last year—that’s less than a carry-on suitcase,” said NBC News’s senior White House correspondent Gabe Gutierrez. “Is that a lot of fentanyl compared to, say, Mexico? The vast majority of the fentanyl is brought in through Mexico, not Canada. So what else does Canada need to do?”
In 2024, a total of 43 pounds of fentanyl were seized at the northern border, while a whopping 21,100 pounds were seized over the southern border, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. By comparison, only two pounds of fentanyl were seized at the northern border in 2023, the 2,000 percent increase to which Leavitt referred. 
While technically both Gutierrez and Leavitt were right, the president’s propagandist appeared to become agitated when confronted with the actual numbers behind her supposedly frightening statistic.
“Well, I just told you, last year alone there was a 2,000 percent increase in illegal fentanyl—” Leavitt said.
“But it’s only 43 pounds, Karoline—” Gutierrez interjected. 
“You’re asking me for what the president’s justification is for these tariffs. It’s not up to you. You’re not the president, Gabe!” Leavitt snapped. 
“And frankly, I think it’s a little bit disrespect-ul [sic] to the families in this country that have lost loved ones at the hands of this deadly poison,” Leavitt continued. 
Not only did Trump’s chief communicator fail to offer a plausible explanation for why the U.S. needs to levy steep tariffs against its neighbors to the north, but earlier this week she failed to explain why exactly the tariffs would be good for Americans, merely citing “facts” without offering actual evidence. 
On Wednesday, the Trump administration granted a one-month exception to U.S. automobile companies from the 25 percent tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada after speaking with CEOs of Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis. Leavitt read a statement from Trump claiming to have told the auto executives to relocate their production to the U.S.
Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg had a cheeky take on Donald Trump’s speech to a joint session of Congress.
“We won the popular vote by big numbers and won counties in our country 2,700 to 525—on a map that reads almost completely red for Republican,” Trump told both chambers Tuesday night, using his win to claim that he had been given a “mandate” by the country to radically reimagine the federal government.
But the former South Bend mayor couldn’t help himself from adding a dash of spice to Trump’s reminder, offering to The Late Show With Stephen Colbert that the president may have won, but only by a historically tiny margin.
“Despite what you heard tonight, he came in with just under 50 percent of the vote,” Buttigieg said. “He won, I’m not disputing that. But it was the smallest popular vote margin since Nixon.
“I wonder how he feels about something that important being that small in his case,” Buttigieg mused with a smirk. “And he has lost support from there.”
“To be smaller than Tricky Dick is, uh—gives one pause, I would say,” Colbert quipped back.
Holy shit! Pete Buttigieg was on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, and man, does he know how to get under Donald Trump's skin...Man, oh man... 🤣 pic.twitter.com/ek66RjDLXH
A CNN Poll released this week found that just 39 percent of Americans felt the country was moving in the right direction, as opposed to 45 percent who believed it was moving in the wrong direction. 
Even Republicans don’t seem to believe in the “mandate” decree coming from the White House. In Tennessee over the weekend, an angry town hall before Representative Diana Harshbarger screamed, “No!” when the Republican lawmaker asked if there had been a “mandate to the president from the American people,” who she claimed “overwhelmingly” voted Trump in.
“We’re giving the billionaires tax cuts!” a man shouted at Harshbarger.
Donald Trump is already backing off some of his tariffs only one day after they went into effect.
On Wednesday, the Trump administration granted a one-month exception to U.S. automobile companies from the 25 percent tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada. The change came after the president spoke with CEOs of the Big Three automakers: Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis. Trump reportedly told the auto executives that they should move their production to the United States, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.
“We spoke with the Big Three auto dealers,” Trump said in a statement read by Leavitt. “We are going to give a one-month exemption on any autos coming through USMCA,” he added, referring to the free trade agreement between Mexico, the U.S., and Canada. Leavitt told reporters that Trump is open to additional exemptions, although none are planned at this time.
Trump imposed tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China on Tuesday, prompting the stock market to plummet and Mexican, Canadian, and Chinese leaders to announce retaliatory tariffs. The premier of Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, told the Associated Press that the auto industry in Canada and the U.S. could only last 10 days before assembly lines would start to shut down.
“People are going to lose their jobs,” Doug Ford said. 
The exemption follows remarks by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick Wednesday morning on Bloomberg Television that Trump would update his tariff plans later in the day.
“There are going to be tariffs, let’s be clear,” Lutnick said. “But what he’s thinking about is which sections of the market that can maybe—maybe—he’ll consider giving them relief until we get to, of course, April 2.”
Trump’s tariffs are expected to raise the prices of numerous goods in the U.S. aside from automobiles, including groceries, electronics, and farm equipment. They also will cause negative ripple effects for the American public, including higher utility bills, partly due to Ford’s threats to cut off electricity to the United States.
It remains to be seen if there will be more carve-outs for Trump’s tariffs, although a rapidly worsening economy could force the president’s hand. What Trump’s endgame is for his very unwise economic plans is not clear, but in the meantime, the American taxpayer will bear the brunt of his folly. 
In just a handful of weeks, Donald Trump’s nationalist policies and aggressive tariffs have rattled Canada’s economy, the American stock market, and, with it, the two nations’ long-standing alliance.
But Trump’s most recent approach to negotiating with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau amid the spontaneous trade war has taken a hard turn, more closely resembling catty high school gossip than legitimate foreign policy.
“Justin Trudeau, of Canada, called me to ask what could be done about Tariffs,” Trump posted on Truth Social Wednesday. “I told him that many people have died from Fentanyl that came through the Borders of Canada and Mexico, and nothing has convinced me that it has stopped.” 
“He said that it’s gotten better, but I said, ‘That’s not good enough.’ The call ended in a ‘somewhat’ friendly manner!” Trump continued. “He was unable to tell me when the Canadian Election is taking place, which made me curious, like, what’s going on here? I then realized he is trying to use this issue to stay in power. Good luck Justin!”
That lackadaisical response came on the heels of a harrowing address given Tuesday by Trudeau, in which the Canadian leader accused Trump of attempting to undermine Canada’s economy in order to “annex” it as America’s fifty-first state. He also urged Americans to look in the mirror and consider if they’re comfortable tossing the nation’s strongest Western alliances to effectively become Russia’s puppet.
Trump “feels strongly that it would be very beneficial for the Canadian people to be the fifty-first state of the United States. They wouldn’t be paying for these tariffs, and they’d have much lower taxes if they became a part of our great country,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Wednesday.
The president’s controversial tariffs went into effect first thing Tuesday, imposing 25 percent levies on Canada and Mexico as well as a 10 percent tariff hike on Chinese goods. In return, Canada and China slapped the U.S. with equal tariffs, while Mexico promised to do the same, with further details to come Sunday. Meanwhile, the spontaneously unpaused levies immediately followed reports that Trump had directed administration officials to draft a proposal that would lift sanctions on Russia. 
“I can tell you that every country is very, very aware that if the American government is willing to do this to their own closest ally, neighbor, and friend,” Trudeau said Tuesday. “Then everyone is vulnerable to a trade war.”
Less than a day after the tariffs went into effect, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox Business that they could be undone as soon as Thursday.
“Both the Canadians and Mexicans were on the phone with me all day today trying to show that they’ll do better,” Lutnick told the network, with regard to fentanyl flows into the U.S. “So I think [Trump] is going to work something out with them.”
The Department of Government Efficiency’s slashing of the federal workforce is disproportionately hurting veterans, and the damage is only going to get worse.
According to a March 4 memo first obtained by Government Executive, the Department of Veterans Affairs is planning to lay off as many as 83,000 employees. The Trump administration wants the department to get its workforce back to 2019 levels, when the VA employed 399,957 people and before millions of veterans became eligible for greater care. More than one in four VA employees are veterans.
The “aggressive” cuts will “resize and tailor the workforce to the mission and revised structure,” VA chief of staff Christopher Syrek wrote in the memo, which was sent to employees on Tuesday.
The department is expected to deliver its plans to “increase workforce efficiency” to the Office of Personnel Management by April 14.
Employment at the VA increased significantly under Biden with the passing of the 2022 PACT Act, which expanded health care benefits for veterans exposed to toxins and was the result of years’ worth of advocacy from various veteran organizations.
DOGE couldn’t care less. The pseudo-agency’s plan to fire 17 percent of the VA’s workforce is just the latest move in its assault on veterans and, more broadly, the federal government. Last month, DOGE laid off 2,400 VA employees and more than 6,000 veterans from other federal agencies.
DOGE also sought to terminate 875 affected contracts at the VA, which would significantly harm veterans’ access to health care services. The cuts have been temporarily suspended, but will likely resurface. 
Florida’s attorney general has launched an “active criminal investigation” into manosphere bigot Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan, who arrived in the country just last week at Donald Trump’s behest. 
The brothers returned to the U.S. from Romania, where they still face rape and human trafficking charges, after the Trump administration sought the return of their passports, opposing a court order requiring them to remain in the European nation while the investigation continued.
Now that the dual British-American citizens have returned stateside, they’ve found themselves the subject of yet another criminal investigation for alleged sex crimes.
“These guys have themselves publicly admitted to participating in what very much appears to be soliciting, trafficking, preying upon women around the world,” Attorney General James Uthmeier said Tuesday. 
“Many of these victims are coming forward, some of them minors—people can spin or defend however they want, but in Florida, this type of behavior is viewed as atrocious. We’re not going to accept it,” Uthmeier said. “They chose to come here and set their feet down in this state, and we’re going to pursue every tool we have within our legal authority to hold them accountable.”
Uthemeier announced the investigation in a post on X Tuesday, saying his office had conducted a “preliminary inquiry” into the brothers. “Based on a thorough review of the evidence, I’ve directed the Office of Statewide Prosecution to execute search warrants and issue subpoenas in the now-active criminal investigation into the Tate brothers,” he wrote.
Andrew Tate posted on X dozens of times between Tuesday and Wednesday, claiming his innocence and attacking Uthmeier and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who appointed the attorney general.
“This isn’t the America I know. This is a sad sad day for America,” Tate wrote in one post Tuesday, describing the investigation as “absolute communism.” 
Last week, Andrew Tate denied all wrongdoing. “We’ve no criminal record anywhere on the planet ever,” he said. 
That claim is still pending, however, as the brothers remain under investigation in Romania. Last year, a Romanian court ruled that after those court proceedings finished, the brothers could then be extradited to the U.K. to face additional charges of sex crimes. 
Andrew Tate, a former kickboxer and professional misogynist, is a central figure in the manosphere of contemptible internet chauvinists, a group of right-wing shills Trump utilized in his run for the presidency—and now intends to thank in kind. 
Elon Musk may be getting another handout from the federal government. 
The Wall Street Journal reports that the tech mogul’s satellite internet company, Starlink, could soon make up to $20 billion thanks to a Commerce Department overhaul of a Biden-era program to expand broadband internet access to rural areas. 
Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has told staff that he wants to make grants under the $42.5 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program “technology neutral,” which would give states the ability to allocate more funds to satellite internet providers like Starlink instead of companies using fiber-optic cable technology to connect rural areas.
Musk and Starlink could draw much more funding under the new rules. Under the program’s existing restrictions, states can only fund alternatives to fiber, such as satellite, in places where laying fiber cables isn’t cost-effective or feasible. Starlink was expected to haul in around $4.1 billion under the existing rules but could rake in anywhere from $10 billion to $20 billion if Lutnick’s changes are accepted. 
Those changes could be announced this week, albeit without many details, according to unnamed sources cited by the Journal. Implementing the overhaul could take longer, as some states may decide to change the allocation of funding they’ve already received. But Musk could easily grease the wheels or complicate matters if he devotes any X posts to the issue. 
The tech mogul and fascism enthusiast has benefited immensely from the Trump administration, only adding to his government-subsidized wealth as the world’s richest man. If these changes to rural broadband funding go through, not only will Musk get richer but his power in the federal government will increase and extend to rural America.  "

Chatter around the long-rumored foldable iPhone is picking up.

        If it turns out to be true, the device sounds expensive — and impressively high-end.
    

        To be clear, Apple hasn't confirmed plans to build a foldable iPhone. However, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of TF International Securities published a note on Wednesday with more details on a foldable iPhone design that he had previously heard about.
    

        Kuo, known for his Apple predictions and supply-chain sourcing, described the mysterious project as a ""top-tier iPhone"" with a ""crease-free inner display"" and an expected retail price of over $2000. The device could begin mass production in the last quarter of 2026, Kuo said.
    

        Such a price tag would make it more expensive than any of its predecessors and many MacBook models, but Kuo said the iPhone's ""must-have"" status would attract a strong demand for a premium device if the quality is up to par. The iPhone 16 Pro Max is currently the priciest smartphone Apple offers starting at $1199.
    

        ""A phone with such a high price point affords Apple a true higher-end luxury offering to balance out the push on lower-priced alternatives like the iPhone 16e,"" Dipanjan Chatterjee, a Forrester analyst, told Business Insider.
    

        Apple is currently facing fierce competition in the smartphone market as Chinese competitors offer lower-cost phones and high-end models with novel form factors. 
    

        However, it's important to note that Apple could always change course and not release such a device. It's not unusual for Apple to put significant resources behind big projects and ultimately scrap them. The tech industry buzzed with talks of an Apple Car for years until the tech giant reportedly scrapped the project.
    

        ""I definitely believe it's under development. I'm less sure it'll ever see the light of day,"" Morningstar analyst William Kerwin told BI of the foldable iPhone.
    

        Kuo said the foldable iPhone would bring back Touch ID to potentially replace Face ID, but this time the button would be on the side of the device. It'd have a ""book-style design"" and a 7.8-inch inner display, he added. Apple is also pursuing a ""crease-free"" display, according to Kuo — something other phone makers like Samsung are also chasing.
    

        Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.
    

        While both Bloomberg and The Information have reported that Apple is planning foldable screen devices, Kuo's predicted timeline should be taken with a grain of salt. A Kuo note in 2023 said that foldable iPads would hit shelves in 2024, for example, which has yet to materialize.
    

        A bet like a foldable iPhone, in an area where competitors like Samsung and Huawei have already ventured, is a ""significant gamble"" that could result in a device with low demand, similar to the $3500 Vision Pro, said Jacob Bourne, an analyst at BI sister company EMARKETER.
    

        ""Apple's better bet might be to focus on other emerging technologies rather than chasing a form factor that may not maintain its appeal long-term,"" Bourne told BI.
    

        Rumors of smart glasses, AI-powered home devices, and robotics swirled around Apple in 2024. Apple was late to the artificial intelligence race last year with Apple Intelligence launching months, or years, after competitors' similar software.
    

        CEO Tim Cook told investors that he felt ""optimistic"" about Apple's product pipeline during its fiscal first-quarter 2025 earnings call.
    

        When asked about the future of the iPhone's form factor and where Apple sees opportunities to innovate, Cook didn't go into detail but hinted that there's more to come.
    

        ""I think there's a lot of innovation left on the smartphone,"" Cook said.

Software stock Oracle (ORCL) was last seen down 6.5% at $151.07, extending a pullback that started in mid-February. The stock is still up 34.7% year-over-year, however, and familiar support at the $152 region could step up ahead of the company’s fiscal third-quarter earnings report. Ahead of the event, the stock is within striking distance of a historically bullish trendline.
Per Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, ORCL has pulled back to its 200-day moving average. Specifically, the stock is within 0.75 of the trendline's average true range's (ATR), or 20-day ATR, for the first time in at least eight of the past 10 trading days, after spending at least 75% of the last six months above it. Oracle stock has seen three similar signals over the past three years, after which it was higher one month later two of those times, with an average 5.1% gain.
 
Oracle has a rather upbeat post-earnings history. The stock finished higher after three of its four reports in 2024, including an 11.7% pop after the same reporting period a year ago. Investors will be watching this one to gauge how the company faring compared to its artificial intelligence (AI) competitors, especially after enhancing its capabilities this quarter.
Options traders have been betting more bearishly lately. This is per the security’s 10-day put/call volume ratio of 0.77 at the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Cboe Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX) that ranks in the 93rd percentile of its annual range. In other words, bearish bets are at their most popular compared to the last 12 months.
Whatever the direction, options are a preferred route. The equity's Schaeffer's Volatility Scorecard (SVS) sits at a 94 out of 100, meaning ORCL has exceeded option traders' volatility expectations during the past year."

Sonic the Hedgehog 3 releases on 4K Blu-ray on April 15, and preorders for Shadow and Sonic Steelbook Editions are available now.
By 
    Steven Petite
   and 
    Jon Bitner

 Sonic the Hedgehog 3 Limited Edition Steelbook (4K Blu-ray) 
 $35.69 (was $45) | Releases April 15 
 Sonic the Hedgehog 3 Limited Edition Shadow Steelbook (4K Blu-ray) 
 $45 | Releases April 15, Amazon Exclusive 
 Sonic the Hedgehog 3 Standard Edition (4K Blu-ray) 
 $36 | Releases April 15 
Sonic the Hedgehog 3 races onto 4K Blu-ray on April 15 with three different editions, including a pair of Limited Edition Steelbooks. Amazon has an exclusive Shadow the Hedgehog-themed edition that is quite challenging to secure. The retailer's most recent restock sold out quickly. In better news, Amazon and Walmart are offering a nice discount on the Sonic the Hedgehog Steelbook, dropping the price to $35.69 (was $45).
If you want to complete your Sonic movie steelbook collection, the Sonic 2-Movie Steelbook Collection as well as standalone 4K Steelbook Editions of the first two films are available to order at Amazon. For the past couple months, 4K editions of the Sonic movies were sold out and unavailable to order. While multiple of these are still sold out, Amazon is now letting customers place orders.
Sonic the Hedgehog 3's first Limited Edition Steelbook features the Blue Blur doing what he does best. This edition comes with 4K Blu-ray, standard 1080p Blu-ray, and digital versions of Sonic 3. You also get a bunch of bonus featurettes.
Preorders for the Sonic variant of the Limited Edition Steelbook are available at Amazon and Walmart for $35.69 (was $45). This is the first preorder discount for Sonic 3.
Amazon and Walmart both offer preorder price guarantees. You won't be charged until your order ships, and you will only pay the lowest price offered between the time you preorder and release.
Sonic 3's Limited Edition Steelbook featuring Shadow is exclusive to Amazon and available to preorder for $45. Unsurprisingly, this edition has been harder to find in stock than the Sonic variant. Amazon sold out of its first batch of preorders fast when preorders opened in January. The Shadow Steelbook was unavailable for nearly all of February, so the March restock might not remain in stock for long. UPDATE: As of March 6, Amazon is sold out again.
The Shadow variant complements the Sonic edition by offering the same art design, just with red streaks instead of blue.
Like the Sonic variant, the Shadow version costs $45 and comes with 4K Blu-ray, standard 1080p Blu-ray, and digital versions of Sonic 3. You'll also get the same bonus features. The only difference between the two releases is the steelbook.
If you don't have any interest in steelbook cases, the 4K release of Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is up for preorder for $36 at Amazon and Walmart. Amazon preorders for the standard 4K edition should reopen soon.
Preorders for the DVD release are available for $21 at Amazon. Sonic 3 won't receive a standalone 1080p Blu-ray edition, at least not at launch. As such, even if you don't have a 4K media player, you'll still need to get the 4K edition to watch Sonic 3 on standard Blu-ray.
Alternatively, you can rent or buy Sonic 3 from Prime Video or stream it on Paramount+.
Here's the full list of special features for Sonic the Hedgehog 3:
Sonic the Hedgehog 3's theatrical release led to multiple editions of the first two movies to sell out, including the 4K Blu-ray 2-Movie Steelbook Collection shown above, but Amazon has replenished its stock in recent weeks. As mentioned, the 2-Movie Steelbook Collection is currently listed as ""temporarily out of stock,"" but you can order a copy for Amazon to ship when it gets more. As of March 4, here's the stock situation for Sonic, Sonic 2, and the Knuckles miniseries at Amazon.
Sonic 4K Blu-rays:
Sonic Blu-rays:
Sonic fans can also save on Blu-ray and DVD releases of the Blue Blur's animated TV series. Most notably, you can get a nice discount on the 1993 series, which was the first adaptation for Sega's now-iconic mascot. Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog: The Complete Series is on sale for $46 (was $60) at Amazon. This collection includes all 65 episodes on Blu-ray (in standard definition). You can also get Sonic the Hedgehog: The Complete Series on DVD for only $12.47.

As data and results for 2024 come in, the global automotive sales ranking is also out. Since BYD entered the top 10 list in 2023, another Chinese maker entered the list in 2024. This time, it’s Geely. Now, 2 of the top ten automakers, in terms of sales, are Chinese.
Toyota Group (including Daihatsu and Hino) topped the ranking for the fifth consecutive year. Although its sales dropped 3.7% year-on-year (YoY) due to steep competition in China and pausing production due to regulatory compliance issues, the group still leads the board with 10.82 million vehicles sold. Volkswagen ranks second with 9.03 million. Hyundai Motor Group and Stellantis, owners of Peugeot, Citroën and Jeep, follow at number three and four, respectively. The top four rankings did not change.
BYD entered the list in 2023 with 3.02 million sales. Last year, the Chinese brand surpassed General Motors and Ford and became number 5 with its 4.27 million vehicles sold, up 41.26% YoY. Geely, on the other hand, sold 3.34 million and ranks number 10 in the global list.
BYD’s shares surged 11.5% on 6 February to limit up, with its market value growing 82.2 billion RMB (11.28 billion USD) to 905 billion RMB (124.14 billion USD) in one day. This was mostly attributed to the brand announcing its plans to have AI smart driving as a standard feature on all its vehicles. AI-related and tech shares grew significantly this week, due to the aftershock of DeepSeek unveiling its R1 model before the Chinese New Year.
In other news, BYD has been launching several electric vehicles abroad in South Korea and India. Geely is also producing two models in its factory in Egypt. BYD and Geely, along with SAIC Motor, launched their lawsuit at the General Court at CJEU against the EU’s tariffs on Chinese automotive last month. Chinese automakers’ road to overseas (出海) might see another boost in Europe.

The AI investing frenzy isn't over. It's just migrating.

        Chinese AI names have seen major gains in recent days on fresh excitement for newly announced technology. Alibaba gained 8% over two days after unveiling an open-sourced AI model that it said used less data than its rival DeepSeek.
    

        Here are some other notable two-day moves for Chinese AI stocks:
    

        On the other side of the ledger are US-based AI stocks, led by Nvidia, which has dropped by 4% over the two days and is trading 17% lower in 2025. The overall US semiconductor space is approaching a bear market, down by 15% from February highs.
    

        It's fair to say the losses for US firms have been China's gain. As American juggernauts spend hundreds of billions of dollars on developing AI technology, China has shown an ability to accomplish similar things at lower costs.
    

        The declines on Thursday weighed most significantly on the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, pushing it nearly 3% lower and bringing its year-to-date loss to more than 6%.
    

        After the reveal of DeepSeek's cheaper model jolted US investors in January, doubts about the sustainability of massive AI spending increased.
    

        While the mega-cap AI ""hyperscalers"" like Meta, Microsoft, and Alphabet have committed billions of dollars to the technology, growing model efficiencies suggest AI hardware demand might not be as high as expected.
    

        That has weighed heavily on US chipmakers in recent weeks, and even positive earnings results have failed to shore up faith. Marvell's slight earnings and guidance beat this week was the latest example of a tepid response to otherwise solid results, with shares plunging on Thursday.
    

        Macroeconomic uncertainty and concerns about high valuations in the US market are fanning the flames of the AI-driven tech bubble bursting.
    

        That's not the case in China. According to Bloomberg, valuations haven't soared nearly as high as those of US peers, with the Hang Seng Tech index trading at about 19 times forward earnings.
    

        Other catalysts are fueling the rally. This week, China's National People's Congress gave the country's tech sector a boost by announcing support for the broad application and development of large-scale AI models.

81,2025-03-06,"A new kit from JSAUX lets you replace the 40Wh battery of the ASUS ROG Ally with a 65Wh battery.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

The ASUS ROG Ally is one of the best gaming handhelds. It does, however, have a flaw that could steer people away.
The ROG Ally has less-than-ideal battery life. Its 40Wh battery contributes to that, as does the large display of the console.
JSAUX just announced a new upgrade kit designed to extend the ROG Ally’s battery life. The Battery & Thermal Upgrade Kit with Back Cover for ROG Ally includes a 65Wh battery, which is more than 50% larger than the stock 40Wh battery that comes in the ROG Ally.
It also has a new backplate and aluminum heat shield, which JSAUX states will enhance thermal management.
JSAUX includes all the essential tools for installation, such as a screwdriver, pry bar, flush cutter, anti-static gloves, and spare screws.

Battery & Thermal Upgrade Kit with Back Cover for ROG Ally | $79.99 from JSAUX (coming soon)
This kit includes a 65Wh battery for the ASUS ROG Ally and a new back plate designed to improve the thermals of the gaming handheld. All the essential tools for replacing the battery of the ROG Ally are included.
In our ASUS ROG Ally review, our Gaming and News Editor Rebecca Spear gave the device a 4.5 out of 5. The gaming handheld received high marks for its performance, comfortable design, and display.
One of the few negatives Spear shared about the ROG Ally was its battery life.
All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.
""Overall, the Ally is an impressive little device, but it does have one huge flaw. You guessed it — the battery life still isn't great,"" said Spear.
She added that the ROG Ally is ""a rather expensive device that doesn't offer much battery life.""
In her testing, Spear only got one hour and 38 minutes of use on average. To hit over three hours of playtime, Spear had to reduce settings significantly.
While a larger 65Wh battery should help extend gaming sessions, we can't say for certain how much longer an upgraded ROG Ally will last without firsthhand testing.

If you love the ROG Ally but want a larger battery, you don't need to swap out the battery of your gaming handheld. The ROG Ally X has an 80Wh battery, which is double the size of the stock 40Wh battery in the ROG Ally and still larger than the 65Wh battery in the JSAUX kit.
The ROG Ally X has the same Z1 Extreme processor and 7-inch touchscreen as the ROG Ally. But the ROG Ally X has more memory and storage.
The ROG Ally X also has upgrade joysticks, back buttons, and a better D-Pad than the ROG Ally.
Our own Rebecca Spear has a full breakdown of the ASUS ROG Ally X vs. ASUS ROG Ally. That piece includes spec tables, thermal imaging, and first-hand experience with both devices.
""The ROG Ally X has an 80Whr battery capacity, which provides more than twice the battery life of the original Ally. In my own battery life testing, the Ally X could last two hours and 10 minutes while playing demanding games at max TDP, which is more than 50% of an increase from the original device's measly 51 minutes at those same settings.""
Picking between the ROG Ally and ROG Ally X will depend on your preferences and if you already have an ROG Ally. Paying for an entirely new console may not be worth it if you already have an ROG Ally and the technical knowledge to swap its battery.
Swapping out the ROG Ally's battery is relatively straightforward, but prior experience with hardware repairs is recommended. JSAUX has a video breaking down all the steps.
The following is not meant to be a step-by-step guide, since JSAUX already has that in a written guide with photos and a video. But it should give you a gauge of how technical the process is.
Before you replace the battery of your ROG Ally, make sure you have all the required equipment and watch or read the steps before you begin.
JSAUX cautions anyone replacing the battery of the ROG Ally to ensure the device is powered down and that you have proper Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) precautions in place.
You should also be aware that disassembling the ROG Ally may affect its warranty.
To replace the battery of the ROG Ally, you'll need to remove screws, then the back plate, then remove the triggers of the console to get started.
You'll need to remove the back button from your ROG Ally's original back plate and install it and the triggers onto the new back plate.
A few springs and screws need to be placed correctly during the process, and you need to remove certain cables, so I'd suggest watching the video above as you go.
One of the steps involves trimming down plastic protrusions, so take your time — measure twice, cut once.
The final steps involve adding the heat sink, reattaching cables, and screwing everything into place. You'll also need to add an adhesive strip to help secure the new back plate.

    With APYs wavering, now's the time to lock in a great rate and protect your earnings.
  
Certificate of deposit rates have largely held steady since the Federal Reserve paused interest rates in January. But some banks have been tweaking their CD rates and lately, this means cutting annual percentage yields.
This week, the top five-year CD rate on our list, America First Credit Union's, fell from 4.25% APY to 4.20% APY. BMO Alto slashed its rates on six-month, one-year, three-year and five-year CDs from 3.50% to 3.90% APY down to 3.00% to 3.15% APY.

Today, in the Calculated Risk Real Estate Newsletter: 1st Look at Local Housing Markets in February
A brief excerpt: NOTE: The tables for active listings, new listings and closed sales all include a comparison to February 2019 for each local market (some 2019 data is not available).

This is the first look at a few early reporting local markets in February. I’m tracking over 40 local housing markets in the US. Some of the 40 markets are states, and some are metropolitan areas. I’ll update these tables throughout the month as additional data is released.

Closed sales in February were mostly for contracts signed in December and January when 30-year mortgage rates averaged 6.72% and 6.96%, respectively (Freddie Mac PMMS). This was an increase from the average rate for homes that closed in January, and up slightly from the average rate of 6.7% in December 2023 and January 2024.
...
In February, sales in these markets were down 4.8% YoY. Last month, in January, these same markets were up 7.2% year-over-year Not Seasonally Adjusted (NSA).

Note that most of these early reporting markets have shown stronger year-over-year sales than most other markets for the last several months.

Important: There was one fewer working day in February 2025 (19) as compared to February 2024 (20). So, the year-over-year change in the headline SA data will be above the change in the NSA data (there are other seasonal factors).
...
This was just a few early reporting markets. Many more local markets to come! There is much more in the article.

84,2025-03-06,"In brief: Although Nvidia's RTX 5090 is technically the new performance king, it isn't a quantum leap over its predecessor, the 4090, which remains one of the best products for gaming and AI workloads. As insufficient stocks of new GPUs hold the market back, refreshing Nvidia's older architecture with a monstrous VRAM pool might satisfy customers seeking compute performance. 
A web developer going by ""@eisneim"" on X (formerly Twitter) claims to have seen an RTX 4090 with 96GB of VRAM, quadruple the 24GB normally available to gamers. It's unclear when the productivity-focused graphics card might be available, but signs suggest the 5090 hasn't completely pushed its predecessor out of the market.
Eisneim spotted the 96GB RTX 4090 in a Shenzhen factory while exchanging his 24GB model for the 48GB variant. An employee said the enhanced GPU is still undergoing testing and that mass production will take some time, but they expect high demand. Eisneim predicts it could become available in China in three or four months. Another user, Fangyin Cheng, claims to have heard from a Shenzhen vendor that the 96GB card might appear in May.
RTX 4090 96GB confirmed! I went to the GPU factory one last time to sell my last 4090 24GB and buy a brand new 48GB; 24GB was bought in late 2023 for ￥15k($2059) now sell for ￥18.2k($2498) and buy 48GB for ￥22300($3061) @bdsqlsz @main_horse pic.twitter.com/U01jQbiY7h
Most consumers are likely only familiar with the 24GB version of the enthusiast-class GPU, which provides plenty of VRAM for playing games in 4K with ray tracing. However, variants with twice that amount began appearing in China last year. Designed to facilitate cloud computing and AI, the enhanced graphics cards typically cost over $2,000, and the 96GB versions could double the cost.
The development comes as Nvidia's latest GPU lineup, the RTX 50 series, faces headwinds due to low stock and the threat of tariffs on goods imported from China into the United States. Retail CEOs predict higher prices, and market analysis suggests the dedicated graphics market could suffer.

Every RTX 50 GPU, including the RTX 5070 that Nvidia launched this week, instantly disappeared from store shelves on launch day and is rarely – if ever – available at MSRP. Reports suggest that supply could improve in the coming weeks, but a new report from Jon Peddie Research warns that tariffs might slow the market through the rest of 2025.
Weak stock from Nvidia, the market leader, already dampened GPU market growth in the fourth quarter of 2024, which grew by only one percent. All of that growth came from laptop graphics, which rose by two percent while discrete AIBs declined by three percent.
AMD's competing products, the Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT, might launch with significantly stronger supply while beating Nvidia's mid-range GPUs in early benchmarks. Whether Team Red's cards actually appear at MSRP remains to be seen, but Jon Peddie predicts that the company won't escape the impact of tariffs.

85,2025-03-06,"As the 1950s became the '60s, a new automotive phenomenon was emerging: The sports car. In 1960 Chevrolet broke the 10,000-unit production milestone for their Corvette, the first time that automotive niche had reached five figures. 

Up until that point, automobiles in America were predominantly objects used to move families around. Now there was a mass-market alternative in a fun, powerful two-seater with no backseat for pesky kids. 
 
The Corvette later went on to be associated with astronauts, further cementing its ""cool"" status.
 
Around the same time, Ferrari began dominating the international racing scene with their 250 GTO. In 1962 the 250 took first, second and third place at the grueling 24-hour LeMans race.
 
Carroll Shelby, an American race car driver turned car designer and entrepreneur, wanted to knock both cars off of their pedestals. He envisioned a powerful, lightweight car that would smoke the Corvette at stoplights and best the Ferrari at Le Mans.
Shelby talked to Ford, who was eager to compete with the Corvette. Ford made powerful engines, but had no Corvette-like chassis. Then Shelby talked to AC Cars, a British company that made the AC Ace, a lightweight, early English sports car. The AC Ace had the suitably lightweight chassis, but no engine; their supplier, Bristol, had discontinued them.
Shelby talked AC into shipping their chassis to California, where he could retrofit them with powerful V8 motors that Ford was happy to supply. Shelby strengthened the chassis, steering, suspension and differential to handle the extra power, and the AC Cobra was born.

The Cobra started racking up race wins, and by 1965, it beat the Ferrari at the World Sportscar Championship.

However, production realities prevented the AC Cobra from becoming a mass-market Corvette killer. Shipping car bodies from a small manufacturer in England to California, where a team hand-modified each to accommodate Ford engines, was not a scalable business model. Shelby shifted his attention to helping Ford with the Mustang, and together they produced the Shelby Mustang GT350 and later the GT500. As both began racking up race wins (see the movie Ford v. Ferrari), the AC Cobra project fell by the wayside.

The AC Cobra was discontinued in 1968. Only about 1,000 were ever produced, and as you'd expect from their target market, a lot of them wound up being wrapped around trees. The few AC Cobras that have survived to present day are extremely valuable. Meanwhile, the Mustang became Ford's legitimate Corvette challenger, and the model exists to this day.
A bit of surprising news: Here in the 2020s, the AC Cobra is making a comeback—by way of Sweden and China. AC Cars has somehow survived to this day and company CEO David Conza, a Swede, is bringing back the Cobra in both Coupe and Roadster forms. 









 
 
The cars will be built in both England and Sweden, the latter country being home to T-Engineering, an outfit of ex-Saab engineers backed by Chinese carmaker Dongfeng. And the engines are still by Ford. How's that for globalization.
 

 




The resurrected Cobras will be the domain of the rich. The Roadster and Coupe will run around $245,000 and $280,000, respectively.

Farizon's SV is an electric-only van, one of the first available in the UK.
Commercial vans, particularly those used for last-mile delivery, can really benefit from electrification. EVs are quieter, smoother to drive, and much more efficient. However, so far most of this class of EV have been conversions of existing non-electric models. Flexis and Renault will be launching pure EV vans in 2026, but another company has beaten them to it – Farizon. I took the Farizon SV all-electric van for a spin at the UK launch to find out whether it could give incumbent commercial vehicle brands an electric shock.
Farizon is another Chinese import to the UK. It’s not the first – we’ve had SAIC-owned Maxus on British roads for a few years now. However, this brand is part of the giant Geely group, which also owns companies familiar to Europe including Volvo, Polestar, Lotus, LEVC, Zeekr, and Lynk & Co, plus even more in China. Farizon is Geely’s main commercial vehicle marque and already has an electric truck that I got to explore (but not drive) in China last year. SV stands for “SuperVan”, so it comes with high expectations and the mood at the launch was quite bullish.
The rear doors on the Farizon SV can fold entirely round to the sides of the vehicle.
The van being launched in the UK is more modest in size than this articulated truck. It’s aimed at deliveries and tradesmen. There are five variants from L1H1 to L3H3 in size, with three battery sizes available – 67kWh, 83kWh, and 106kWh (gross capacities). The smaller capacities use LFP technology, meaning they are extremely robust and able to withstand regular charging to 100%. The 106kWh pack uses NMC technology and is only available with the L3H3 chassis size. While the van itself has a four-year, 120,000-mile warranty, the battery’s guarantee is a car-like eight years, which means a lot more in a commercial vehicle expected to do high mileages. Farizon’s confidence comes from over a million kilometers of real-world testing with the SV. All versions of the SV sport the same 231PS electric motor with 336Nm of torque.
There is no B-pillar, increasing the width of ingress through the side door.
Maximum payloads range from 1,035kg to 1,350kg, depending on battery size, all of which are more than the Mercedes-Benz eSprinter, which I tested a year ago and found to be a good step forward in electric van capabilities. Spatial capacity ranges from 6.95m3 for the L1H1 body format to 13m3 for the L3H3, which Farizon claims provides up to a 20% size advantage over the leading competitors, although the L3 eSprinter offers 14m3. With an optional towbar, the SV can pull 750kg unbraked or 2,000kg braked, which could be very useful if you need to take trailer-based mobile plant machinery with you. The L2H2 I drove can hold up to 1,245kg with the 67kWh battery and 1,160kg with the 83kWh one. Maximum capacity is 9.39 m3.
Towing up to 2,000kg braked is possible.
The rear doors have a hinge that enables them to fold out and flush with the sides of the van, which isn’t quite as convenient for cramped spaces as the rear shutter door on the Flexis walk-in van. But aside from having a sliding side door, the SV has another trick: no B-pillar. It still offers a platinum NCAP rating, but this wider opening facilitates side ingress, offering 1.8m width on the L1 and L2 or 2.1m on the L3.
Increasingly, van drivers of all types are looking for a car-like experience during their time in their vehicles, and Farizon certainly delivers that. The driver’s seat is heated and ventilated, with a heated steering wheel too. Electric vans are reported to aid employee retention compared to internal combustion versions because they’re less tiring to be in over a working day (less noise, less vibration, easier to drive), and the SV’s pleasant cabin experience is likely to accentuate that benefit.
Farizon has tried to make the driver's cab experience as car-like as possible.
The 12.3in infotainment screen is also quite contemporary compared to many commercial vehicles I’ve driven. It has no satnav, but it does support Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, so a smartphone can be used to supply this function. The system is powered by ECARX’s E02 processor, like many of Geely’s car brands, including Polestar, Lotus and Volvo, so the interface is relatively aesthetic and responsive.
The range of safety functions is extensive, too, and again parallels the latest car capabilities. The parking camera offers a user-adjustable 360-degree view as well as a more conventional 2D rear image, making it much easier to navigate tight spaces. This is accompanied by the full range of car-like ADAS features, such as blind spot detection, rear cross traffic alert, lane change assistance, and even adaptive cruise control.
The vans I drove were the L2 H2 83kWh variety, and I was able to test them in a selection of environments. I tried an unladen SV around the hill track at the UK’s Millbrook Proving Ground. I was also able to try this vehicle on the high-speed circuit at Millbrook. On the hills, the SV wasn’t exactly sporty, even in its highest power mode, but it pulled comfortably up steep inclines. Stability was impressive around corners. At 70mph on the circuit, the Farizon SV felt composed, easily capable of its 84mph top speed, although it was a rather windy day, and this made itself known on a high vehicle driving round a multi-lane highway-style test road.
Some test-driving was performed with a large load of water in the back.
I was also able to drive the same variant with a heavy load of water in the back, strapped firmly down in the cargo space, on a simulation of city streets. The SV’s steering was light enough to handle tight cornering, thanks to a drive-by-wire system. There wasn’t much tactile feedback, but this is a van not a sports car. On a faster urban-style circuit, the weight in the back didn’t ruin braking or handling.
The Farizon SV handled well around simulated city streets.
Regeneration can be set to quite a high level but it’s not enough for single-pedal driving, although the more variable weight of a delivery van makes this less likely to be a useful function anyway. You get three motor power options. Switching to the lowest Eco mode was an eye opener. The vehicle became noticeably more sluggish, and power didn’t kick in significantly with a hard push on the accelerator. However, it still didn’t feel like it was struggling with the load, so this could be a useful power-saving capability you won’t regret using.
With the 106kWh battery, the SV offers up to 247 miles of range in the combined WLTP cycle, or 342 miles in the city cycle. This should be sufficient for inter-city deliveries. The 67kWh battery offers a more modest 188 WLTP miles, and the 83kWh battery 234 WLTP miles, and these figures drop with larger body sizes. However, all these ranges are competitive compared to previous generation electric vans, although the Mercedes eSprinter’s huge 113kWh battery option promises even more.
Optional vehicle-to-load enables appliances to be powered by the vehicle.
The 67kWh battery charges at 120kW while the 83kWh unit offers 140kW – not exactly state-of-the-art by car standards, but this still means you only need 36 minutes to replenish from 20 to 80%. However, the 106kWh NMC battery only offers 120kW DC charging, so takes 40 minutes. With 11kW AC, 15 to 100% charges require 6.5 hours for the 67kWh battery, 9 hours for the 83kWh one, and 10.5 hours for the 106kWh one. So it will be entirely feasible to get back to full capacity overnight.
Farizon showed off its vehicle-to-load abilities by powering a barista's coffee machine throughout ... [+] the launch event.
There’s even a Vehicle-to-Load (V2L) option, enabling you to use the van’s battery to power external devices requiring up to 3.3kW. At the launch, Farizon was showing this off by powering a coffee barista’s machine throughout the event. More realistically, it will be useful to have the power available for using tools onsite.
Electric vans haven’t yet experienced the same market inroads that electric cars have. One of the reasons is the cost, which forces potential new owners to balance the daily savings from going EV against larger initial outlays. Farizon hopes to sweeten the deal with more reasonable costs for the SV. The UK prices, exclusive of tax, range from £45,000 ($58,000) for the L1H1 with the 67kWh battery, up to £56,000 ($72,000) for the L3H3 with 106kWh unit. There are no trim levels to add expense, either – all vehicles come with the cabin and safety features described earlier.
The Farizon SV could be delivering to UK locations from April onwards.
With a commercial van, the vehicle itself is only half the story. Competent distribution support is essential, and Farizon has enlisted Jameel Motors for this aspect. Jameel has 80 years of experience including extensive work with Toyota, so in theory the SV will be in good hands aftermarket. It all sounds promising, and the driving experience was one of the most comfortable I’ve had in a van. The Farizon SV could give the tentative electric van market just the nudge it needs to speed up. Demos will be available this month, with initial deliveries in April."

People find all kinds of ways to market their clothing to make it look as appealing as possible. However, some people try to hide stains or rips to make the clothing look nicer. I mean sure, it does look a little nicer in the promotional photos, but the buyer is going to be very upset when they get that shirt and realize it has a big oil spot on it.
These people shared their experiences trying to buy clothes online, and it's way harder than it should be! You can check it all out below, from sellers who can't seem to get to the post office, to people who are trying to sell utter garbage.

90,2025-03-06,"Just one day before President Donald Trump is set to unveil his crypto reserve plan at the White House Crypto Summit, his crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, has begun piling up significant amounts of Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Wrapped Bitcoin, and other digital assets.
On-chain analysis revealed that World Liberty Financial expanded its holdings significantly, acquiring $10 million in Ether, $10 million in Wrapped Bitcoin, and $1.5 million in MOVE, the native token of the Movement Network blockchain. 
On Thursday morning, Ether saw a nearly 4% increase, trading at $2,246 over the past 24 hours. The MOVE token surged by 21%, while Wrapped Bitcoin, which mirrors Bitcoin’s growth, rose by 2.8%.
Read more: What is Trump’s World Liberty Financial?
It’s not just Bitcoin that has caught the attention of Trump and his family — they are also fans of Ether. Last month, Eric Trump, the President’s son, endorsed the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency on social media, stating, “In my opinion, it’s a great time to add $ETH.”
Recent data from Arkham Intelligence reveals a significant increase in World Liberty Financial’s Ether holdings, which surged from around 2,200 Ether on Monday to more than 7,000 Ether by Thursday.
 President Donald Trump is set to unveil plans for it at the White House Crypto Summit on Friday. His plan envisions a reserve comprising Bitcoin — often hailed as “digital gold” for its inflation-hedging properties — alongside Ether, XRP, Solana, and Cardano.
However, crypto leaders have criticized Trump’s idea, arguing that if a reserve is established, it should be exclusively Bitcoin-based. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Bitcoin would receive a “unique status” under Trump’s framework, while other cryptocurrencies would be regulated differently.
Coinbase (COIN+5.55%) CEO Brian Armstrong, Strategy (MSTR+7.29%) Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, Robinhood (HOOD+7.37%) CEO Vlad Tenev, and other industry leaders will attend the event.

91,2025-03-06,"On March 10, 2000, the Nasdaq Composite index peaked at 5,048.62, more than double its value from just a year earlier. Internet startups with “dot-com” slapped on the end of their names and little more than ideas to sell to investors had soared to astronomical valuations over the previous five years. 
But all parties come to an end. 
Within weeks of that high, the index began its fall, with a mix of factors spooking investors. Eventually, the Nasdaq shed more than 75% of its value, wiping out $5 trillion in market capitalization. The age of irrational exuberance was over.
A quarter-century later, the rise of AI has market veterans debating whether history repeats, or merely runs the same bubble algorithm with new inputs. Some market watchers see structural differences preventing an immediate collapse, while tech critics warn we’re debugging the same old bubble logic. Beyond balance sheets lies a deeper concern: We keep forgetting that the social costs of tech revolutions outlast their market corrections.
There are similarities between the market today and 25 years ago as some investors grow nervous, according to Kairong Xiao, a finance professor at Columbia Business School. But if the moment we are in ends up bursting, the market structure means things will look different than 2000. “The dot-com bubble was characterized by a lot of IPOs, with companies trying to get into the biggest asset class in the Nasdaq” Xiao said. “Today, due to regulation and many other structural changes, new investments nowadays have been through the private equity market.”
That structural shift from public to private funding represents one of the most significant changes. While Netscape’s 1995 IPO sparked a gold rush of public offerings from internet startups, today’s most prominent AI developers — OpenAI and Anthropic — remain private despite valuations in the tens of billions. They can access enormous capital without facing public market scrutiny or quarterly earnings pressure.
The companies leading today’s tech wave also differ markedly from their dot-com predecessors. In 2000, many market darlings were freshly minted startups with minimal revenue. Today, AI innovation is largely funded by cash-rich tech giants including Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL), and Nvidia (NVDA), companies with diverse revenue streams and substantial profits. This concentration of resources among established players may provide a cushion against market volatility that didn’t exist during the dot-com era.
“The big companies can survive if there’s a crash in the market because they have other ways to raise financing, whereas the small guys get eliminated,” Xiao said.
Yet not all market observers are convinced we’ll avoid a reckoning entirely. Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said today’s AI boom has runway left — but also an expiration date.
“I still think we got another two good years left in the market,” Munster said. “Unfortunately, it’s gonna end in the same way that it did 25 years ago.”
For Munster, the key indicator isn’t current valuations but the psychological state of the market, which he sees as “euphoric” right now. He defines euphoria — that intoxicating moment when rational investing gives way to the fear-of-missing-out — as when the forward price-to-earnings multiple exceeds 50 times. Today’s Nasdaq trades around 25 times earnings. But Munster said that euphoric threshold could be reached by 2027, potentially triggering what he described as a “spectacular burst.”
While Munster said he believes the substance of AI will eventually exceed the hype, that likely won’t happen in time to avoid a market correction.
“By the time the numbers start to improve, the bubble will have burst,” Munster said. “I lived through the dot-com bubble. I don’t want to see people’s lives get blown up, but I also think that AI is going to be more impactful than the internet.”
Yet for all the structural differences between eras, some experts warn that we risk repeating the same fundamental mistakes. Mar Hicks, a history of technology professor at the University of Virginia and author of “Programmed Inequality,” said our retrospective view of previous tech bubbles often minimizes their negative impacts.
Those harms, Hicks said, include substantial erosion of privacy norms and labor market transformations that began during the first internet boom. Early e-commerce companies like Kozmo.com used venture capital to offer services at unsustainably low prices, conditioning consumers to expect convenience without cost — a precursor to today’s gig economy.
“That led to getting people used to this idea that you can have anything for free, essentially,” Hicks said. “It made it so that people either didn’t think about the labor and paying the labor of the people who are doing this work, or it completely changed the structure of the labor market.”
Hicks suggested that while Silicon Valley’s memory may be short, its executives aren’t entirely forgetting history — they’re strategically misremembering it. Today’s AI leaders appear to have studied the dot-com collapse primarily as a public relations case study rather than a substantive business lesson.
“The way in which they’re being mindful is they now know what they have to say in order to maybe get people to not get upset about these new revolutionary technologies,” Hicks said. “They’re giving lip service to it because they don’t ever address any of the real problems.”

If you’ve been looking for a bright and colorful QLED TV to be the centerpiece of your home theater, we’re willing to bet you’ve looked at your fair share of Samsung TVs. For years, Samsung has produced some of the brightest TVs on the market, and we’ve been able to test a number of these sets. Samsung TV deals are always on our radar, and we came across this incredible offer earlier today:
For a limited time, when you purchase the Samsung 75-inch QN90D 4K QLED at Samsung or B&H Photo-Video, you’ll only pay $1,800. The full MSRP on this model is $3,300. This discount is part of Samsung’s Discover Samsung Spring Sale.


Released in 2024, the QN90D delivers exceptional SDR brightness and holds up well against glare, making it a great TV for brightly lit rooms. Samsung’s Neo Quantum 4K AI Gen 2 processor runs the show for picture processing and 4K upscaling, ensuring every frame is as bright, colorful, and packed with detail as the last. And thanks to HDMI 2.1 connectivity, along with VRR and ALLM support, the QN90D is a fantastic TV for gaming. It also supports every HDR format except Dolby Vision.
Sports and action movie fans will be glad to learn the QN90D has a native 120Hz refresh rate and fast response time, so you shouldn’t see any ghosting or blur. As for speakers, Samsung outfitted this model with a 60W 4.2.2 speaker system, which can also be paired up with a Samsung Q-Symphony soundbar for an even more immersive soundstage.
The fact that this is a smart TV may not be as exciting now as it was a decade ago, but Samsung’s Tizen OS UI and smart hub are nothing to shake a stick at. You’ll be treated to hundreds of popular apps like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, plus hours of free live TV channels and casting capabilities via AirPlay 2.
Take $1,500 off the Samsung 75-inch QN90D 4K QLED when you purchase today, and be sure to take a look at our lists of the best 75-inch TV deals and best QLED TV deals for even more discounts on top Samsung sets!


Not every household can accommodate a 98-inch TV, but those that can should (right?). Unfortunately, not all of us have the funds to splurge on such a big screen, but now and then, you’ll find TV deals for these larger LED-backlit models. Actually, we found a solid discount on a giant Samsung set not too long ago. The deal is through Woot and is as follows:
For a limited time, you’ll be able to order the Samsung 98-inch Q80C 4K QLED for only $3,000. That might not sound like a big sale, but consider that, according to Woot and , this TV’s full price was once $8,000! Let's pause and note that  and  are selling the TV for around $4,000, so the $5,000 discount is a bit of an exaggeration. Regardless, at $3,000, this TV is still over $1,000 off its MSRP!
When you spend a decent chunk of change on a soundbar, you’ll end up with audio that sounds closer to authentic surround sound than you’d expect. That’s because top brands like Samsung know a thing or two about virtualizing larger speaker configurations. Still, not all of us have thousands of dollars burning holes in our pockets, which is why we’re always on the lookout for the best soundbar deals. As luck would have it, Samsung comes through yet again:
Today, when you purchase the Samsung HW-Q850D Dolby Atmos Soundbar at Best Buy, you’ll only pay $600. That’s a $500 discount, friends!
The biggest TVs on the market are made by companies we all know and love. We’re talking titans of AV like Samsung, LG, and Sony, and the focus of today's deal is TCL. We look for the latest and greatest TV deals around the clock, and we’ve yet to come across a 98-inch TV sale that’s going to beat this one:
For a limited time, when you order the TCL 98-inch Q6 Series (2024) at Amazon, Best Buy, and PC Richard, you’ll only pay $1,500. The full MSRP on this TV is $3,000.

94,2025-03-06,"Apple’s foldable iPhone project has so far remained in the realms of consumer tech imaginations. However, from time to time, we hear industry insiders and analysts dropping a few nuggets of information about it. The latest such prediction comes from Ming-Chi Kuo, and it’s not a good one.
In his latest investor note, Kuo has given an expected price range of roughly $2,000 to $2,500 for Apple’s book style folding phone. For comparison, Samsung’s latest and greatest foldable phone, the Galaxy Z Fold 6, carries a price tag worth $1,900.
Kuo cites multiple reasons for the high asking price. First, he argues that Apple has a certain brand image to maintain, and to keep that status-quo, the asking price will be on the higher side compared to the competition, assuming Apple matches it with a sufficiently alluring hardware quality.
Next, the insider — who has had a mixed track record with Apple predictions lately — adds that the demand for a foldable iPhone would still be high, despite a bigger hit on the wallet of buyers.
There are, however, a few aspects that could justify the premium. Kuo notes that Apple is chasing a crease-less design for its foldable phone. So far, no smartphone maker has been able to fully eliminate the crease, even though Oppo’s Find N5 has reached the closest to that elusive goal.
Furthermore, Apple is chasing a premium build that involves using a Titanium alloy for the chassis. The company might also use a stainless steel-titanium composite for certain internal parts, following in the footsteps of the iPhone 16 Pro duo.
Moreover, the phone will be quite thin, measuring only 4.5-4.8mm across when unfolded, quite close to the impressive Honor Magic V3 and Oppo’s latest foldable phone. For the battery tech, Apple will reportedly employ the same high-density formula as the package it is eying for the rumored iPhone 17 Air model.
However, nothing is written in stone yet. Kuo says the final specifications will only be decided in the second quarter of 2025, and mass production is expected to begin in the last quarter of 2026. As far as market arrival goes, Apple’s foldable iPhone might hit the shelves in the second half of 2027, as per Kuo.
If you're waiting on Apple's rumored foldable iPhone, start saving your pennies. And nickles, dimes, and quarters, too. Analyst Tim Long told Barclays the first foldable iPhone could start in the $2,300 range, which would make it nearly double the price of the current most expensive iPhone (the iPhone 16 Pro Max) and one of the single priciest handsets on the market.
This announcement follows rumors that the foldable iPhone will enter mass production sometime in 2026 or 2027 and lines up with what tipster Ming-Chi Kuo predicted for the price. That said, the rumored handset has gained a lot of attention from iPhone fans. The expected demand for the iPhone foldable is great enough that even the higher price tag might not hurt sales.
Oppo's compact flagship phone is close to launching, is confirmed to be called the Oppo Find X8s. The company has been teasing its advancements over the competition fervently and recently threw light on the phone's display upgrades over other phones, including one way it beats the iPhone 16 Pro.
The Oppo Find X8s is claimed to feature extremely thin bezels along all four sides of its display. Zhou Yibao, the product manager for Oppo's flagship Find series, shared an image on Chinese social media Weibo comparing the bezels on the upcoming compact phone -- previously speculated to be called the Find X8 Mini -- with those on what appears to be an iPhone 16 Pro or the iPhone 16 Pro Max.
Apple Wallet has seen several improvements recently, but the most recent update changes Subscriptions & Payments to Preauthorized Payments. This naming scheme is more straightforward and clear about what it does, and it also gives you an idea of any upcoming payments.
This feature is only present in the most recent version of the iOS 18.4 beta, though. If you go looking for it on your own device (and you aren't participating in the beta), you won't be able to find it. Currently, you can see upcoming payments by opening Settings > Apple Account > Subscriptions. You can view active and inactive subscriptions here and the amount and date of the next payment.

96,2025-03-06,"Denmark's state-run postal service, PostNord, is to end all letter deliveries at the end of 2025, citing a 90% decline in letter volumes since the start of the century.
The decision brings to an end 400 years of the company's letter service. Denmark's 1,500 post boxes will start to disappear from the start of June.
Transport Minister Thomas Danielsen sought to reassure Danes, saying letters would still be sent and received as ""there is a free market for both letters and parcels"".
Postal services across Europe are grappling with the decline in letter volumes. Germany's Deutsche Post said on Thursday it was axing 8,000 jobs, in what it called a ""socially responsible manner"".
Deutsche Post has 187,000 employees and staff representatives said they feared more cuts were to come.
Denmark had a universal postal service for 400 years until the end of 2023, but as digital mail services have taken hold, the use of letters has fallen dramatically.
PostNord says it will switch its focus to parcel deliveries and that any postage stamps bought this year or in 2024 can be refunded for a limited period in 2026.
Fifteen hundred workers face losing their jobs, out of a workforce of 4,600.
""It's a super sad day. Not just for our department, but for the 1,500 who face an uncertain future,"" employee Anders Raun Mikkelsen told Danish broadcaster DR.
Denmark ranks as one of the world's most digitalised countries. 
There's an app for almost everything: few people use cash, and Danes even carry drivers' licences and health cards on their smartphones.
Bank statements, bills, and correspondence from local authorities are all sent electronically.
Public services send communications via a Digital Post app or other platforms and PostNord Denmark says the letter market is no longer profitable. 
Letter numbers have fallen since the start of the century from 1.4 billion to 110 million last year.
The decision will affect elderly people most. Although 95% of Danes use the Digital Post service, a reported 271,000 people still rely on physical mail.
""There are many who are very dependent on letters being delivered regularly. These include hospital appointments, vaccinations or decisions regarding home care,"" Marlene Rishoj Cordes, from Aeldre Sagen (DaneAge) told Denmark's TV2.
PostNord has weathered years of financial struggles and last year was running a deficit. 
Danish MP Pelle Dragsted blamed privatisation for the move and complained the move would disadvantage people living in remote areas.
The introduction of a new Postal Act in 2024 opened up the letter market to competition from private firms and mail is no longer exempted from VAT, resulting in higher postage costs.
""When a letter costs 29 Danish krone (£3.35; $4.20) there will be fewer letters,"" PostNord Denmark's Managing Director, Kim Pedersen, told local media.
He said Danes had become increasingly digital and the decline in letter volumes had become so pronounced that it had fallen by as much as 30% in the past year alone.
PostNord also operates in Sweden. It is 40% Danish-owned and 60% Swedish-owned.
The US president claims that control of the island is essential to American national and economic security.
The Democrats party wants a gradual move to independence but the second-placed party is keen to speed it up.
Five of the six parties favour Greenland's independence from Denmark, differing only on how quickly that should come about.
Donald Trump's vow to take over Greenland has shone a global spotlight on the island's elections.
Danes, who have been loyal allies of Washington, are blindsided by Trump's insistence on taking over Greenland.

97,2025-03-06,"In Finland, the number of homeless people has fallen sharply. Why? The country applies the ""Housing First"" concept agains homelessness."
98,2025-03-06,"The number of UK homes installing heat pumps supported by government-funded incentives rose to a record level last year.
Figures released on Thursday showed 52% more of the low-carbon heating systems were installed than in 2023.
Experts said part of the rise was due to an increase in the grant offered by the government's Boiler Upgrade Scheme (BUS) to persuade people to switch from gas boilers.
But the heat pump industry warned that running costs needed to fall for the government to hit its targets to install hundreds of thousands of the devices each year as part of its Net Zero plan to tackle climate change.
A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: ""The energy shocks of recent years have shown the urgent need to upgrade British homes and help more people benefit from homegrown energy.
""That's why we have almost doubled the budget for the Boiler Upgrade Scheme to £295 million for the next financial year, and just launched a new campaign to help make more families aware of our offer of a £7,500 heat pump grant.""
Most UK homes use gas boilers to meet their heating needs but gas is a fossil fuel that when burnt produces planet-warming gases. 
With home heating accounting for 14% of the UK's carbon emissions, switching households from gas boilers to heat pumps is a key part of the government's climate pledges.
Heat pumps use electricity rather than gas, so as the country moves to generating electricity from renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, heat pumps will be responsible for far fewer planet-warming emissions than boilers.
About half of heat pumps currently being installed in the UK are supported by government funding - the remainder are made up of commercial installations and new builds which do not receive support. 
One of the most popular government support mechanisms is the Boiler Upgrade Scheme, which provides a £7,500 grant to households to offset the cost of installation.
Ed Matthew, UK programme director for think tank E3G, said the decision by the previous government to increase the grant by 50% has had the biggest impact on the installation figures.
""It has been absolutely critical for making it affordable for households to buy this technology,"" he said.
In its first year, the scheme only spent a third of the funding allocated due to low public interest. But for 2024-2025 it is expected to overspend its budget.
Mr Matthews said it was critical that in the government's June spending review it recommits to the programme and provides greater funding for low-income households as the current costs - even with the grant - can be prohibitive. 
""They do not want to take their foot off the brake here. If they suddenly start slashing the heat pump grant that's going to make the market crash,"" he said.
He also ""strongly welcomed"" the government's announcement on Thursday that it was launching a new communication campaign to build public understanding of heat pumps, which he hoped would combat misinformation about the technology.

Despite the progress, the total number of heat pump sales, including those not supported by government programmes, was just shy of 100,000 last year, according to the Heat Pump Association (HPA). This is significantly below the government's target of 600,000 a year by 2028.
But Charlotte Lee, chief executive of the HPA, remained positive because of future planning policy changes expected later this year.
""The future homes and building standards will see the market move. 200,000 homes are potentially being built every year, [and] the vast majority of those will be required to have a heat pump - it will absolutely create a gear change in the market,"" she said.
Madeleine Gabriel, head of sustainable mission at charity Nesta, agreed that changes to planning rules could also help to address the regional disparities in installation.
""The key thing is removing a rule that meant that you could only install a heat pump if you were more than one metre away from your property boundary, which made it difficult if you've got a small garden,"" she said.
This explains why dense urban areas, like London, has some of the lowest installation rates as a large share of people live in flats, she added.
Ms Gabriel and Mr Matthew agreed with the UK government's independent climate advisors, the UK Climate Change Committee (UKCCC), that the biggest barrier is the high price of electricity.
In a major report published last month, the UKCCC said that the cost of electricity could be brought down if the levies applied to electricity bills, to fund the cost of social and environment schemes, were removed or placed on gas bills. 
""Once the consumer can save money [with heat pumps], I think it really changes the level of interest. We're moving from early adopters that think it's the right thing to do to, actually, this is just a sensible financial investment choice,"" Ms Lee said.
