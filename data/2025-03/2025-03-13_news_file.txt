President Donald Trump says he's not concerned with how the stock market performs as he implements his protectionist agenda.

        That might soon change.
    

        The S&P 500 is down nearly 9% from its February 19 peak, prompting Trump to acknowledge that markets may experience volatility as he places tariffs on Canada, Mexico, China, and the European Union.
    

        But is there a point at which the downside pressure becomes too unbearable politically for the president? His treasury secretary, the former hedge fund investor Scott Bessent, told CNBC on Thursday that the White House is ""focused on the real economy"" and unconcerned about the market's volatility.
    

        However, other people have doubts. After all, economic strife thanks to the post-COVID inflationary episode arguably cost Democrats their bid for reelection last year. And with top earners propping up consumer spending, a significant stock market decline could start to weigh on their willingness to open their wallets. That could therefore dampen growth, which is heavily dependent on consumers.
    

        Marko Papic, the chief strategist at BCA Research, thinks Trump's breaking point could come rather soon. He said a 15% to 20% decline in the S&P 500 would force the president to start walking back his trade war.
    

        ""For sure he's going to care about the stock market because he's going to lose political capital if the economy goes into recession or if households feel poor,"" Papic said. ""There's absolutely no way he's impervious to that.""
    

        Desmond Lachman, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute who's a former International Monetary Fund official, believes it's more a question of how quickly and violently the sell-off unfolds and less about the total cumulative drawdown.
    

        ""I would think it's got more to do with the speed and disorderliness of the movement,"" Lachman said. ""What's occurred over the last couple of weeks, if that continues at this kind of pace, he'll have to cave.""
    

        With a Republican-controlled Congress in which Trump threatens to unseat members who don't fall in line, and with a 6-3 conservative majority in the Supreme Court, financial markets may be the last true check on Trump's power, Lachman said.
    

        ""They don't care what he thinks, they'll just dump the stocks,"" Lachman said of investors. ""That's really the only check we've now got on ridiculous policies.""
    

        ""The stock market's going to act like the bond market used to, with the bond vigilantes coming in and punishing governments running big budget deficits,"" he continued. ""At some point, he's going to be forced to cave.""
    

        In the event that financial and economic volatility continue, Papic said, other checks on Trump's ability to impose his policies will start to emerge. While Republican members of Congress are punished politically for protesting Trump's agenda, a weakened economy and reeling stock market could provide an incentive for senators or representatives to dissent and ""make a name for themselves,"" he said.
    

        In such a scenario, Trump's consolidation of power could look drastically different in a few months' time, Papic said.
    

        ""If they mess around and find out, he could be a lame duck in three months,"" Papic said. ""We'll be writing those takes much faster than anyone thought because he's got a very narrow majority in the House.""

1,2025-03-13,"Where do Elon Musk‚Äôs business interests end and Donald Trump‚Äôs political interests begin? Trick question‚Äîthey‚Äôre one and the same.
How else do you explain the jarring sight of the President of the United States hawking Teslas on the White House South Lawn? Trump has always been a salesman, lending his name to real estate, casinos, restaurants, steaks, vitamins, a fragrance for men, watches, water, a bicycle race, office chairs, sneakers, vodka, coins, another fragrance, NFTs. You could, at this very moment, buy a Trump pickleball paddle from the Trump Store online, or a Trump sea mist & sage candle.
But Trump is most famously a pitchman for himself. (And Pizza Hut, if the price is right.) To spend this much political capital on Musk? The world‚Äôs richest man? Over a few protests at Tesla dealerships and a tanking stock price? Come on.
Trump is no altruist. Musk did, though, spend nearly $300 million on the 2024 US election cycle, with the vast majority of that directly in support of Trump‚Äôs presidential campaign. His transformation of Twitter into X has created an online MAGAtopia barely rivaled by Trump‚Äôs own Truth Social platform. And his work with the so-called Department of Government Efficiency has let Trump outsource the tedious mechanics of actual governance.
Trump reading off a literal list of Tesla retail prices is the purest distillation yet of a dynamic that won‚Äôt end well. It‚Äôs already going quite badly, for them and for us: The stock market is tanking, Musk is nearing rock bottom in opinion polls. GOP representatives are canceling town hall meetings rather than face the wrath of constituents over DOGE. Trump‚Äôs own cabinet officials are apparently just as fed up with Musk‚Äôs level of influence.
Meanwhile, that influence continues to grow. When engineers from SpaceX invaded the Federal Aviation Administration, they reportedly were quick to suggest their own Starlink technology as the solution to the agency‚Äôs technical problems. On Thursday, a month after Musk inexplicably met with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi in Washington, DC‚Äîwith three of Musk‚Äôs children in tow‚ÄîStarlink inked deals this week with two major wireless carriers there, creating a glide path for operating in the country.
Even Congress, supposedly a coequal branch of government, is beholden to Musk‚Äôs tempers and tweets. At a talk at Georgetown University‚Äôs Psaros Center on Tuesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson named Trump and Musk as the two people he prioritizes.
‚ÄúElon has the largest platform in the world, literally,‚Äù Johnson said. ‚ÄúIf he goes on and says something that's misunderstood or misinterpreted about something we're doing, he can blow the whole thing up.‚Äù
What started as a self-serving bromance has become more volatile, and it goes deeper than DOGE. Trump told a reporter during his infomercial on Tuesday that he would label anyone who committed violence against Tesla dealerships a ‚Äúdomestic terrorist.‚Äù On Wednesday, members of the House DOGE subcommittee sent a letter to Federal Bureau of Investigation director Kash Patel and US attorney general Pam Bondi to probe the ‚Äúwave of organized attacks‚Äù in recent weeks against Musk and Tesla.
Rather than process the ‚ÄúTesla Takedown‚Äù protests as a sign of the deep unpopularity of DOGE and its ringleader, Trump and his adherents have leaned into conflation. What‚Äôs good for society is what‚Äôs good for Elon Musk. What‚Äôs bad for Elon Musk must be bad for society.
The lines are too blurred and the stakes too high. When Elon Musk calls the foreign minister of Poland a ‚Äúsmall man,‚Äù will that animus be reflected in US policy? When he tells members of Congress to call him with concerns about DOGE, will they be speaking with a special adviser to the president or the guy who holds billions of dollars in government contracts? Whose interests does it serve when Musk blames a denial-of-service attack against X on Ukraine, even though there‚Äôs no indication that the country was involved?
It‚Äôs hard to overstate how deeply weird it is to see Trump, who never met a self-promotion he didn‚Äôt like, promote someone else. Even weirder when that person is increasingly a liability. In previous administrations, Musk‚Äôs deep unpopularity would have made him exactly the kind of person Trump fired unceremoniously, with an offhand I barely knew the guy. But Elon Musk is no Anthony Scaramucci. He‚Äôs not even a Corey Lewandowski. He‚Äôs the world‚Äôs richest man, and by god he needs to sell some cars.
There may be signs that this fever is breaking. Musk reportedly has designs on donating $100 million to Trump-affiliated political action committees; The Financial Times says that Musk was rebuffed and is wearing out his welcome. Musk wanted a government shutdown; Trump has pushed aggressively to prevent one.
But whatever rifts may exist between Trump and Musk aren‚Äôt wide enough to stop the president from dropping at least $90,000 on a cherry-red Tesla Model S Plaid. To save him from saying ‚Äúeverything‚Äôs computer!‚Äù in front of press pool cameras when confronted with a modern dashboard. To give Musk a vote of confidence so over-the-top that it simultaneously debases himself and his office.
Tesla stock had a nice bounce, though.
How long will Donald Trump and Elon Musk‚Äôs close relationship last?

Tesla has lost so much value in such a short period of time that JPMorgan analysts said they couldn't think of another comparable moment in automotive history.

        ""We struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly,"" they wrote, adding that the closest example was when Japanese and Korean car brands lost sales amid ""diplomatic disputes"" with China in 2012 and 2017, respectively.
    

        The JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note on Wednesday that those historical cases were ""confined to a single market, whereas the decline in Tesla sales in 2025 is not specific to any one nation or geography.""
    

        JPMorgan analysts cut their price target on Tesla by about 41% from $230.58 to $135, lowering guidance on vehicle deliveries for the first quarter of 2025 to about 355,000 ‚Äî an 8% year-over-year decrease from the first quarter of 2024.
    

        From December to Wednesday after trading hours, Tesla lost nearly 49% of its market cap, seeing its peak value of $1.54 trillion from the end of last year fall to about $777 billion.
    

        This steep drop has come as Tesla experiences a global decline in sales and branding issues stemming from its chief executive's politics.
    

        For a moment, Elon Musk's big bet on Donald Trump seemed to pay off. Tesla was the only EV company to see its¬†stock surge¬†after the president's electoral victory in November. The underlying assumption appeared to be that Musk's company could benefit if the Tesla CEO had the ear of the new administration and guided the White House's efforts to slash government spending.¬†
    

        Now, that assumption is being challenged in some analysts' latest guidance, which notes a possible headwind in demand because of Musk's work with the Trump administration.
    

        ""Mr. Musk's work with the Department of Government Efficiency has proven controversial domestically, and while as many members of the political right may be pleased as those on the left are displeased, the effect on Tesla sales seems nevertheless negative,"" JPMorgan analysts wrote.
    

        In recent weeks, Tesla showrooms across the US have seen protests and a string of vandalism incidents. Trump has rushed to Tesla's defense and said he'd consider labeling the perpetrators domestic terrorists.
    

        Outside brand reputation, some analysts are also concerned that Musk's focus on political affairs is again distracting the CEO from his core businesses.
    

        ""After all, the simultaneous decline in both Tesla pricing and unit volume expectations did coincide with his takeover of X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter,"" JPMorgan analysts pointed out.
    

        Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note on Monday that Tesla shares had fallen because of ""sales data, negative brand sentiment, and market de-grossing"" but that they still saw a buying opportunity for the company.
    

        ""Today, with the stock down 50%, our investor conversations are focused on management distraction, brand degradation, and lost auto sales,"" analysts said.
    

        A spokesperson for Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment.
    

        Despite the company's losses, Tesla remains the most valuable car company in the world.
    

        Second to Tesla is the legacy automaker Toyota, which has a $292 billion market cap.
    

        Morgan Stanley analysts noted several ""catalysts"" in the company's pipeline, including Tesla's robotaxi, expected to hit Austin roads later this summer, and another demonstration of Optimus, the humanoid robot anticipated before the end of the year.
    

        But expectations for¬†Tesla's delivery timelines¬†may have to be tempered, given that the CEO has a history of missing his own deadlines.

The market got two surprisingly tame inflation readings this week, but the upbeat data is getting drowned out by more trade war noise from the White House on Thursday.

        Stocks slid a day after investors got a mild boost from a cooler-than-expected consumer inflation report on Wednesday. Wholesale inflation was also less than expected, with the producer price index flat in February compared to expectations for it to increase.
    

        But, Trump keeps escalating his trade war, with the president rattling markets again on Thursday with a post on Truth Social that said he would slap a¬†200% tariff¬†on all wines, champagne, and other alcohol imports from the EU if the bloc didn't repeal a 50% tariff on US whisky exports.
    

        Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reiterated the administration's position that it is willing to tolerate market volatility as it pursues policies meant to boost the broader economy.
    

        ""We're focused on the real economy. Can we create an environment where there are long-term gains in the market and long-term gains for the American people?"" Bessent said on CNBC. ""I'm not concerned about a little bit of volatility over three weeks.""
    

        All three major indexes traded lower on Thursday. Long-dated bond yields also climbed higher.
    

Here's where indexes stood around 10:30 a.m. ET:


        While Trump's new tariff target is a relatively small portion of all EU imports, it's another sign of a spiraling trade war for investors, who just endured a $5 trillion sell-off in stocks as Trump pushed ahead with his latest round of tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China. 
    

        The news was enough for stock traders to brush off the latest PPI reading, which showed that producer prices remained flat in February, down from the 0.3% growth that economists were expecting. The figures came out after CPI showed that consumer prices rose a less-than-expected 2.8% year-over-year in February.
    

        ""The economy entered 2025 with a downward inflation trajectory. However, the outlook for inflation depends more on tariffs, deportations, and DOGE than the backward-looking data releases right now,"" Bill Adams, the chief economist at Comerica Bank, said in a note.
    

        Traders may also be discounting the cool inflation data as tariffs, which economists have warned could stoke higher prices, haven't yet impacted inflation numbers yet, according to Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management.
    

        ""Clearly this is going to be a much more volatile year and it remains to be seen if all of the revolutionary changes to the economy and trans-Atlantic alliances will lead to a recession or if it will lead to higher growth rates in the future, but in the meantime a more cautious and risk-off posture is warranted,"" Zaccarelli said in a note on Thursday.

What should a CEO do when their company is publicly called out for an inferior product? Many would stay silent. Not AMD CEO Lisa Su.

        In early February, AMD released new data showing how well its AI chips performed at training large language models, using benchmarks developed by a company called SemiAnalysis. Just weeks earlier, the same group had published a searing review of AMD's tentpole graphics processing unit.
    

        The analysts wrote that while the chip looked good on paper, reaching its potential in reality was almost impossible with AMD's existing software. The chief analyst, Dylan Patel, and the rest of the SemiAnalysis team spent five months assessing AMD's GPU, which has struggled to gain market share and mindshare against the dominant player, Nvidia.
    

        ""We were hopeful that AMD could emerge as a strong competitor to Nvidia in training workloads, but, as of today, this is unfortunately not the case,"" SemiAnalysis published in December.
    

        The next day, Patel got a call from Su. The call was scheduled for 30 minutes, but it lasted 90.
    

        ""Feedback is a gift even when it's critical,"" Su tweeted after the call. The new performance data released in February was a punch back in a fight that's far from over.
    

        2024 was the year of Lisa Su. She was Time and Chief Executive Magazine's CEO of the year.
    

        Last year, AMD outsold Intel in its data center business, overtaking its old rival in the traditional data center world. This became the triumphant apex of Su's first decade as the CEO of AMD. Revenue for the whole of 2024 was up 14% year over year ‚Äî gross profits up 22% ‚Äî and yet when Su reported the results in February, the stock went down.
    

        As Su achieved what many thought impossible and conquered her old foil, Intel, a new one had already presented itself in the AI prognosticator Nvidia, led by CEO Jensen Huang, Su's cousin born in the same region of Taiwan as her. Shareholders wouldn't let her forget her biggest rival.
    

        Whether AMD can meet the seemingly insurmountable challenge of Nvidia's estimated 90% market share may come down to the approaches of two Taiwanese-born, US-educated, distantly related CEOs.
    

        Su has already stated the company's goals. She's leaning into open-source software and beefing up support for large language model training and inference customers. Most importantly, she's raising the bar for AMD's software so that it can better stand up to Nvidia's ‚Äî since Huang has long professed that software is Nvidia's secret sauce.
    

        ""We are still in the very early stages with AI, and we believe there's no one-size-fits-all approach to AI compute,"" an AMD spokesperson told Business Insider. AMD declined to make Su available for an interview.
    

        BI spoke with nine people for this story ‚Äî five of whom have at one point had a personal relationship with Su and three of whom worked under her at AMD. They said that whether in 2007, 2017, or 2027, the stoic, thoughtful, quietly confident executive walking the brightest stages in the tech world had been and would be exactly who she seems. Though she may never conquer Nvidia, she won't rest while she's in the No. 2 spot. Her play involves intently listening to partners as well as critics, and it's worked before.
    

        Some early indications suggested that starting at the bottom motivated Su to get to the top.
    

        Born in Taiwan and raised in New York, Su intentionally picked the most challenging STEM field she could think of: electrical engineering. After earning her doctorate, she received multiple offers to stay in academia but decided to join Texas Instruments instead, Dimitri Antoniadis, her thesis advisor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told BI. She wanted to manage people and projects, she recently told Stanford business students. After leaving TI for IBM, she was tapped to serve as a technical assistant for Lou Gerstner, IBM's chairman and CEO.
    

        Antoniadis recalled late-night phone conversations with Su when she was at these ""juncture points"" in her career. She left IBM in 2007, spent 4  years at Freescale Semiconductor, and then came to AMD in 2012.
    

        The professor got one such call in late 2014. Su had managed AMD's various business units and operations for nearly three years ‚Äî deep in the weeds of the entire company yet without the authority to set the overall direction. She called Antoniadis when she was asked to take the CEO job, which meant going after a market dominated by Intel. The original Silicon Valley icon had a market capitalization of more than $150 billion and a reputation for ruthlessness. AMD's market cap was just $2 billion.
    

        ""At the time, I said: 'Lisa, are you serious? Taking on Intel?' She said, 'Why not?'"" Antoniadis told BI.
    

        Su sought multiple opinions on the big decision to head AMD. Lip-Bu Tan, a legendary semiconductor CEO turned investor who's set to step into the Intel CEO role on March 18, was also on the call list. Tan and Su met years earlier when she was at Freescale Semiconductor, and he was impressed from the start, he told BI.
    

        Tan was fully aware of AMD's sad state at the time. The firm had completed two rounds of layoffs since 2011 and pulled out of the processor market. The company needed focus.
    

        ""Only the gaming business was doing well. The rest were struggling,"" Tan said. Despite this, he didn't hesitate to recommend the job to Su. He had just orchestrated a revival of a similar magnitude at Cadence Design Systems and knew the opportunity such a turnaround could be.
    

        ""The market value was less than $3 billion ‚Äî you can't go wrong with that. It is so undervalued,"" Tan said of AMD.
    

        Su took over AMD on October 8, 2014. A 7% staff cut proceeded, and Su set out to make long-term bets and win back customers. Tan said Su soon had top tech execs such as Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Dell's chief operating officer, Jeff Clarke, trusting her, mainly because of her hands-on style. Even for routine annual business reviews, Su knows all the numbers and listens intently to concerns, sources said.
    

        ""They love her. She is very engaged ‚Äî very involved,"" Tan said.
    

        Su has evolved her style over her 10 years as CEO of AMD. She's somewhat less stoic, makes jokes onstage, wears brighter colors, has more perfectly coiffed hair, and has come to appreciate Christian Louboutin heels. AMD declined to comment on these details.
    

        ""I am not surprised at all where she is right now. I truly expected it,"" Antoniadis said.
    

        AMD's market cap has grown to about $160 billion as of Wednesday ‚Äî much higher than its $2 billion market cap when Su first started. This month, all AI stocks have taken a dive amid uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's policy shifts.
    

        Now, Su has a new miracle to perform.
    

        In 2018, Su sat with a handful of Wall Street analysts in a private meeting space near the Las Vegas Convention Center. The Consumer Electronics Show, one of the largest tech conferences of the year, bustled in the massive building's halls.
    

        Su was just over three years into her job as CEO of AMD, and the company's stock hovered above just $10 per share.
    

        The analysts in that Las Vegas conference room had a lot of advice for the then 48-year-old CEO, according to a person present, who asked not to be named since the session was private. The room was full of men eager to tell Su how to seize on her progress and take AMD to the next level. There was chatter in the nerdier accelerated computing circles that machine learning was ready to scale, and the analysts weren't sure AMD was seeing the signs.
    

        Su took it all in and politely thanked everyone. She knew accelerated computing would change the world as early as 2017, she has since said in interviews. The graphics processing unit made that possible.
    

        At the time, the entertainment industry used them for gaming and graphics rendering. While AMD has designed this kind of hardware for two decades, Nvidia's Huang beat the entire tech industry to the punch when he identified the AI opportunity for GPUs and started building software to help it spread. Since ChatGPT's birth, Nvidia and AMD have been in an epic race ‚Äî only Nvidia had a massive head start.
    

        Both Huang and Su are notoriously hardworking ‚Äî late nights and weekends are a given.
    

        But Huang is a showman. He dominates a stage whether it be at the front of a boardroom or a concert arena. Su is less flashy. She rarely, if ever, raises her voice, and her business strategy echoes that quiet, inexhaustible, confident consistency, sources said.
    

        ""You know she's in charge, but she's also a very quiet leader,"" said Jodi Shelton, the CEO and cofounder of the Global Semiconductor Alliance. Shelton recalled an intimate dinner at Su's Texas home with just Su and her husband, Daniel Lin, where Su asked most of the questions.
    

        ""She doesn't need to interject when someone's speaking. She doesn't have to be the loudest person in the room,"" Shelton continued.
    

        Onstage, Su often paces, making measured announcements. At team meetings, she drills for answers about what needs to be done next and delegates tasks, personally reviewing AMD's GPU distribution on spreadsheets, the AMD employees said.
    

        In a world where CEOs including the former Intel leader Pat Gelsinger have announced plans such as five nodes in four years and fell short in execution, AMD has slowly marched forward. Even Nvidia's yearly cadence of new GPU generations has hit production and installation snags. Su is wary of overpromising and underexecuting, several sources said. Execution is nonnegotiable.
    

        ""That's not very easy for people to do for such a long time,"" said Sharon Zhou, the founder of Lamini, who has committed to AMD hardware over Nvidia. ""Which is why I think she presents the main threat to Nvidia. It forces Nvidia into a place where they can't make mistakes.""
    

        Huang is motivated by being so early that he can form new markets around new technologies, the Nvidia executive Rev Lebaredian told BI. Su wants to meet existing demand with an unfailingly great product.
    

        ""She knows AMD products technically in and out and can hold her own discussing any product with its respective engineers,"" one AMD employee said. ""She's pretty quiet in person, but you could tell by the way she was looking at the lab and talking to the engineers that she was proud and happy to be there.""
    

        Her relentless consistency and focus on strong, reciprocal customer relationships make her undiminishable as a competitor, even for Nvidia, sources said.
    

        ""She's one of the most responsive people,"" Zhou said. When Zhou was trying to close Series A funding for Lamini, Su offered up the entire afternoon to chat with prospective investors, a day after an earnings call.
    

        Many chip industry analysts agree that while AMD's hardware has caught up, it can't truly compete without better software. Nvidia's CUDA software has become the industry standard and allows engineers to program GPUs with flexibility and relative ease. AMD's software is still a work in progress, as SemiAnalysis's report detailed.
    

        For the full 2024 fiscal year, Nvidia reported $115.2 billion in revenue in its data center segment ‚Äî where most AI computing happens. AMD reported $12.6 billion for data centers in the same time period (though the reporting periods are slightly different). It's an enormous gulf that even the best of execution may never close.
    

        Those who know Su say she will never settle for second.
    

        ""She does want to win, which doesn't mean second. It actually means first. First, you have to be second, and then you get to be first,"" Zhou said.
    

        If Su has a winning strategy in mind, it's still a mystery to some AMD watchers.
    

        In a February 5 note to investors, the Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya wrote that AMD had not yet ""managed to articulate"" how or from where it would wrest market share from Nvidia.
    

        ""It could take much more in software, scale deployment, and system-level integration to break AMD's current less than 5% market share,"" Arya wrote.
    

        Winning for Su will be about picking her fights, said Tan, the incoming Intel CEO, who's also friends with Huang. In 2024, Nvidia's R&D budget was about twice AMD's. Su still has to be discerning.
    

        ""You have to pick your best field,"" Tan said. ""You can't do everything, like Jensen,"" he continued. Huang makes the menu, he said. Su can choose only a few dishes to battle over.
    

        On the company's February earnings call, Su moved up the company's next chip launch by a few months.
    

        AMD's fourth-quarter earnings beat expectations, yet investors balked. The Wall Street analyst consensus was that revenue was growing, though not enough came from AI.
    

        ""This is a 10-year arc. This is not a two-year arc. So let's not think about this as what's going to happen next quarter,"" Su told Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff at its conference in September.

ÔªøEpic and Qualcomm are working on Windows on Snapdragon support for Easy Anti-Cheat.
by  Jay Peters
Fortnite is coming to Windows devices with Qualcomm‚Äôs Arm-based Snapdragon chips later this year. Epic Games announced today that it‚Äôs teaming up with Qualcomm to add Windows on Snapdragon support for Easy Anti-Cheat, which will let the game be compatible with those devices.
‚ÄúOver the last year, the introduction of Windows 11 Arm-based laptops has transformed the PC landscape, and laptops with Qualcomm‚Äôs Snapdragon X Series processors represent a rapidly growing segment of the PC gaming market,‚Äù Epic says in a blog post. ‚ÄúHowever, the majority of PC games today are compiled for x64, which doesn‚Äôt translate directly to the Windows on Snapdragon architecture. Due to the way anti-cheat software works with x64 features, additional tooling is required for compatibility with these devices.‚Äù
Epic says that ‚Äúhundreds‚Äù of multiplayer games rely on Easy Anti-Cheat, including Fortnite, and that ‚Äúbattle-testing Windows on Snapdragon anti-cheat support with Fortnite will help ensure smooth implementations in other games.‚Äù

8,2025-03-13,"Intel has a new boss. The new chief executive officer is Lip-Bu Tan, a former Intel board of directors member and chip software maker Cadence Design Systems. He√¢¬Ä¬ôs promising to √¢¬Ä¬údouble down√¢¬Ä¬ù on things that are working and √¢¬Ä¬útake calculated risks√¢¬Ä¬ù where things aren√¢¬Ä¬ôt working nearly as well.
In a statement, Tan didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt offer many specifics about his plans at one of the U.S.√¢¬Ä¬ôs premier chipmakers. Beyond the usual corporate jargon about meeting challenges and finding unique opportunities, he said that the current leadership of √¢¬Ä¬úNew Intel ‚Äúcan learn from past mistakes. He said the goal is to √¢¬Ä¬úrestore Intel√¢¬Ä¬ôs position as a world-class products company.√¢¬Ä¬ù
He added that the company wants to √¢¬Ä¬údelight our customers ‚Äù but is equally focused on delivering for its shareholders. Tan is supposed to take over fully on March 18. After all, the shareholders and investors helped push out the company√¢¬Ä¬ôs previous chief.
Tan is taking the reins after Intel√¢¬Ä¬ôs past CEO, Pat Gelsinger,√Ç¬†who √¢¬Ä¬úretired√¢¬Ä¬ù in December after months of stock downturns and a few too many release SNAFUs. The two interim CEOs put in Gelsinger√¢¬Ä¬ôs place, David Zinsner and Michelle √¢¬Ä¬úMJ√¢¬Ä¬ù Johnston Holthaus, will return√Ç¬†to their respective positions of CFO and CEO of Intel products.
Gelsinger had been at the company since early 2021. His big push was to turn Intel into a √¢¬Ä¬úfoundry√¢¬Ä¬ù for making chips not just of its own design but also from other companies. Intel is supposed to receive $7.86 billion from the Biden administration through the CHIPS Act. According to his public statement, Tan wants Intel to remain a √¢¬Ä¬úworld-class foundry.√¢¬Ä¬ù That will be difficult, considering the company delayed√Ç¬†opening its $20 billion Ohio semiconductor factory√Ç¬†until 2030.
We don√¢¬Ä¬ôt know yet if Tan will be keen on as many antics as Gelsinger√Ç¬†was during his tenure. The former Intel CEO once√Ç¬†did 10 burpees live before the company√¢¬Ä¬ôs 13th-gen Raptor Lake CPUs kickoff. In 2024, when the company was suffering blowback for not being quick on the draw for the AI boom, Gelsinger√Ç¬†notoriously posted Bible√Ç¬†verses to try and calm investor panic.
The previous CEO had been the face of the company during a scandal involving chip instability issues with its 13th- and 14th-gen CPUs. The company suffered a further blow from its most recent Arrow Lake desktop CPUs, with reviewers noting performance issues compared to the top-of-the-line 14th-gen. The company most recently revealed its Arrow Lake chips for mobile, and we√¢¬Ä¬ôre keen on getting our hands on them to find out if they can boost performance for this year√¢¬Ä¬ôs slate of high-end gaming and productivity devices.
Tan did say he wants Intel to be an √¢¬Ä¬úengineering-focused company,√¢¬Ä¬ù so hopefully, we√¢¬Ä¬ôll see some new stock from one of the world√¢¬Ä¬ôs most prolific chipmakers.

10,2025-03-13,"Tesco is to begin a trial giving expiring food to customers for free at the end of the day as it tries to cut food waste.
The supermarket will give away some already discounted ""yellow sticker"" items after 21:30 in some of its smaller Express stores in coming months. 
Tesco already donates expiring food to charities and foodbanks. It says it is taking this step to try to meet its goal to halve food waste.
The company said the expiring food would be offered to charities and shop workers first, before customers could take it. 
A spokesman said the trial would begin in a small number of its Express stores in the UK. The locations have not been specified, nor the starting date.
""This trial will allow customers to take any remaining yellow-stickered items for free at the end of the day, after they have first been offered to charities and colleagues,"" they added.
Tesco is Britain's largest supermarket chain, with a 27.8% market share. It has 3,700 UK stores and about 750 more abroad.
All major UK supermarket chains have partnerships to send surplus food to charities.
The next big four after Tesco - Sainsbury's, Asda, Aldi and Morrisons - have also pledged to halve food waste by 2030. Aldi says it has achieved this already.
Many supermarkets also offer steep discounts on expiring food.
Tesco's trial, however, appears to be the first direct-to-customer policy in the UK.
The firm has a target to cut its food waste by 50% this year, as part of its net-zero emissions push.
Up until February last year it had claimed to have cut food waste by 45% in the five years since 2017. 
However, it was was forced to correct that figure to 18% after it reported a contractor had been using some of the waste to generate gas that was burnt for energy.
Inflation and the rising cost of living means food staples such as meat, eggs, butter and cereals are more expensive than a year ago, while households are also facing higher energy and water bills later this year.
More than seven million people, or 11% of the UK population, were in ""food insecure households""  - meaning people skip meals or don't eat for a day because they can't afford to - in 2022/2023. 
This was an increase of two million from the previous year, data from the Department for Work and Pensions shows.
Many more people have also turned to food banks in recent times. The Trussell Trust food bank has reported more than 1.4 million new users in the past two years.
Tesco's most recent sales figures in January were strong on the back of what it called its ""biggest ever Christmas"" and the highest share of the grocery market since 2016.
Its share price was marginally down 0.5% on Thursday.
Snag clothing is cited in an online debate over whether adverts showing models who appear ""unhealthily fat"" should be banned.
Asda plans to spend more on reducing prices and improving product ranges for customers, but says its profits will suffer.
The woman, in her 60s, was found unconscious at her home by the Asda driver.
The retailer will not pay out a staff bonus for the third year in a row.
The price of China-made smartphones, TVs and laptops could rise in the US and elsewhere, experts warn.

Losing access to a device sucks. Whether it‚Äôs a laptop still running Windows 10, a router that‚Äôs been phased out by your internet provider, or an expensive AI gadget that has suddenly been bricked, it's a bummer to be permanently disconnected from a thing you paid money for. That's where a group of consumer advocates hope to help, by calling on US lawmakers to create policies that support connected products at the end of their lives.
Stacey Higginbotham, a Policy Fellow at Consumer Reports and former journalist who covered internet-of-things devices for more than a decade, has been through the dead device gauntlet more than a few times. She‚Äôs used every weird, swiftly forgotten gadget since the Quirky Egg Minder‚Äîa smart egg carton that was meant to keep you appraised of how many eggs you had but ultimately failed to capture a market. (Though you can still buy one if you really want to.) Turns out, lots of stuff has gone this route.
‚ÄúI had hundreds‚ÄîI'm not kidding, hundreds‚Äîof devices that have died over these decades,‚Äù Higginbotham says. ‚ÄúI have lived through hundreds of poorly thought-out, poorly executed IoT products that have come into the market, failed, and then left a trail of e-waste and unhappy consumers behind them.‚Äù
Higginbotham helped put together a new joint report by the consumer advocacy groups Consumer Reports, US PIRG, and the nonprofit Secure Resilient Future Foundation. The report suggests language for potential legislation that it hopes will be picked up and championed by lawmakers at the state or federal level. The Connected Consumer Products End of Life Disclosure Act, as they call it, would require device manufacturers to indicate how long they plan to support the devices they sell, and give users fair warning when their devices are headed toward the end of their lifespan.
It's a problem that some consumers will be more familiar with than others. The US Federal Trade Commission, in response to a public letter put out by US PIRG, reviewed the websites of 184 products and found that 89 percent of them did not disclose how long the manufacturer intended to support its product.
Lucas Rockett Gutterman, director of PIRG‚Äôs Designed to Last campaign, says that legislation like this could affect more people than just the early adopters of out-there gadgets like the Quirky Egg Minder or the recently deceased Humane AI Pin. It would apply to people‚Äôs phones, laptops, fitness trackers, fridges, stoves, printers, microwaves, cars‚Äînearly every device in your house, office, and driveway that can (or probably will someday) connect to the internet.
‚ÄúI mean, President Trump just said it,‚Äù Gutterman says, referencing the US leader‚Äôs reaction to seeing the dashboard of a Tesla during a recent publicity stunt at the White House: ‚Äú‚ÄòEverything‚Äôs computer.‚Äô That‚Äôs true, it is all computer.‚Äù
When the online services that power a connected device go away, either because a company collapses or just stops supporting certain products, those devices can wind up bricked and broken. They can also remain mostly functional for years, even if the user doesn‚Äôt realize that software support has ended. That means devices may no longer have access to regular security updates, which can make them vulnerable to cyberattacks or use as an insidious node in a wider botnet of zombie devices.
The proposed act would require companies to disclose a ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù support timeframe on a product‚Äôs packaging and online where it is sold, letting users know how long they can expect a device to have access to those connected features. It would also require companies to notify customers when their devices are approaching the end of their support lifespans, and inform them of what features are going away.
Finally, there‚Äôs the cybersecurity angle, which would require internet providers to remove and exchange company-provided broadband routers from consumer homes when they reach their end of life.
‚ÄúThe cybersecurity piece really coalesces around the requirement that internet service providers that lease or sell smart connected devices to their customers take responsibility for managing end-of-life devices on their networks,‚Äù says Paul Roberts, the president of the Secure Resilient Future Foundation, an advocacy non-profit that focuses on cybersecurity.
If the router-specific thing feels a little out of left field, that‚Äôs because Roberts says it is a deliberate two-pronged approach. ‚ÄúThose are two somewhat distinct issues, but they're all part of the bigger problem,‚Äù Roberts says, ‚Äúwhich is putting some guardrails and definition around this smart-device marketplace. Saying to manufacturers, there are rules you need to abide by if you want to sell a smart connected product. It's not the Wild West.‚Äù
Roberts hopes that if the law gets support from lawmakers, and is eventually turned into real legislation, it will create market incentives for companies looking to make more secure software products, similar to how seatbelts and airbags became widely accepted in motor vehicles.
However, it's less clear whether that legislation will ever get any traction at the federal level in the US in a political climate dominated by wanton, whirlwind deregulation. While the European Union has led the way on regulation about product repairability, and end-of-life treatment for vehicles and e-waste recycling, the US hasn‚Äôt made similar moves.
‚ÄúWe are in a place where the FTC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are not really going to do anything that‚Äôs pro consumer,‚Äù says Anshel Sag, a principal analyst at Moor Insights and Strategies. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see any real appetite for regulation.‚Äù
Sag also feels there‚Äôs a possibility that such legislation has the potential to dampen the thirst for innovation that drives startups. If companies know they have to support a product for a set amount of time, it could limit the kind of risks they‚Äôre willing to take.
‚ÄúI don't necessarily think that's a bad thing,‚Äù Sag says. ‚ÄúI just think there's a lot of startups out there that aren't willing to take on that risk. And I think, because of that, it could impede innovation in some ways.‚Äù
Higginbotham is far less worried about this. She points back to her vast collection of dead devices‚Äîwhat has amounted to a veritable pile of e-waste.
‚ÄúI don't know if that really counts as innovation,‚Äù Higginbotham says. ‚ÄúWe need to recalibrate our default setting based on the last decade and a half of experience. Maybe you don't have to just throw a bunch of stuff out into the ether and see what sticks.‚Äù

12,2025-03-13,"The car company‚Äôs fortunes are riding on Elon Musk‚Äôs future.
Produced by ElevenLabs and  News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.
It‚Äôs been a bad month for the stock market. But it‚Äôs been a terrible month‚Äîin fact, a terrible year‚Äîfor Tesla. Even after rebounding since Monday, perhaps with some help from Donald Trump‚Äôs South Lawn salesmanship, Tesla‚Äôs stock price is down almost 40 percent since January 1.
Some of that drop is down to concrete issues with Tesla‚Äôs core car business: Sales last year fell for the first time in more than a decade, and Wall Street analysts are now estimating that they will have fallen again in the most recent quarter. Tesla is facing fierce price competition in China, where its year-over-year sales fell by 49 percent in February, and steeply declining sales in Western Europe. Although the company has promised that it will be rolling out new, more affordable models later this year, details have been sparse at best.
The most important driver of Tesla‚Äôs share slump, however, can be summed up in two words: Elon Musk. Tesla has always been a ‚Äústory stock,‚Äù which is to say the sort of investment whose price depends less on a company‚Äôs economic fundamentals and more on a story of what its future will be. Tesla‚Äôs problem right now is that the hero, and narrator, of its story has gone AWOL.
Investor expectations of what Tesla is going to achieve have certainly changed over time. In the past, investors were focused on Tesla‚Äôs potential to corner the global electric-vehicle market. Today, that ambition has receded, as competition‚Äîparticularly from China‚Äîhas intensified. Instead, investors now envision the company dominating the future market for self-driving cars and AI robotics. But the throughline of the Tesla story has always remained the same: the idea of Musk‚Äôs genius and ability to guide the company into the future. ‚ÄúIt is almost impossible to separate Tesla, the company, from Musk,‚Äù the finance professor Aswath Damodaran has written previously. ‚ÄúWhat you believe about one will drive what you believe about the other.‚Äù And it‚Äôs because investors have bought into Musk‚Äôs over-the-top visions of Tesla‚Äôs future that, even now, the company‚Äôs shares trade at an outrageous price-to-earnings ratio, and its market cap is greater than that of the next nine biggest car companies combined.
The problem for Tesla at the moment is that investors‚Äô faith in Musk has been shaken. His political activities‚Äînot only his work for the Trump administration but also his public support of the far-right AfD party in Germany‚Äîhave led to a backlash against Tesla that certainly seems to have depressed sales in the United States and Europe. His mercurial social-media habits and goofy displays such as waving around a chain saw onstage at the Conservative Political Action Conference are not reassuring to major investors. The reverse: A new Morgan Stanley investor survey found that 85 percent of respondents think that Musk‚Äôs political involvement is having ‚Äúa negative or extremely negative impact on Tesla‚Äôs business fundamentals.‚Äù
Aside from all the noise, the simple reality is that Tesla now seems to be far down on the list of Musk‚Äôs priorities, behind DOGE, SpaceX, his new AI venture, and X. Musk is running a government agency, serving as the CEO of three companies, funding political campaigns, threatening politicians with potential primaries, and posting nonstop on social media. In the most literal sense, he just isn‚Äôt showing that much interest in building cars anymore. Since the beginning of the year, he has offered no real vision of how Tesla will deal with challenges such as the global rise of highly competitive EV manufacturers such as China‚Äôs BYD. In an interview with Fox Business on Monday, he conceded that he was having ‚Äúgreat difficulty‚Äù running all of his enterprises; about the best he could offer investors was a quote from a Monty Python movie: ‚ÄúAlways look on the bright side of life.‚Äù Musk‚Äôs seeming indifference to the car business has become so noticeable that in a note to investors this week, the Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives‚Äîarguably the biggest Tesla bull on Wall Street‚Äîcriticized him for ‚Äúshowing no attention to Tesla during this turbulent time.‚Äù
The appearance at the White House with Trump on Tuesday for what was effectively a car commercial seemed like an implicit recognition by Musk that he needs to change his ways (or at least pretend to do so). As Trump posed in a Tesla Model S that he said he was buying, Musk promised that the company would double its U.S. production over the next two years. Neither man has a great record of keeping promises, but the event was a sign that Musk was doing something to stop the bleeding. Some investors, at least, liked the story: By market close yesterday, Tesla‚Äôs stock was up more than 10 percent from its Monday low.
Whether that will be enough to make up for the losses of the past four months is another question. Tesla investors are used to volatility; since 2018, the company‚Äôs stock price has fallen 40 percent or more on eight different occasions. And story stocks can bounce back quickly if they can recapture investors‚Äô attention and belief. But that will require Musk to demonstrate more conviction and interest in the way he talks about, and runs, Tesla. Right now, he looks like a storyteller who‚Äôs lost the plot.

Quantum stocks spiked on Wednesday after Canadian company D-Wave said it had achieved the elusive industry benchmark of ""quantum supremacy,"" suggesting itsspecialized annealing chip can outperform classical computers in certain tasks.

        ""It's the holy grail for quantum computing. It's what everybody aspires to and is the reason there's so much confusion around quantum supremacy versus quantum advantage versus quantum utility because supremacy ‚Äî true supremacy ‚Äî hadn't been achieved yet,"" Alan Barrett, D-Wave's CEO, told Business Insider. ""And so the industry was coming up with terms that were easier to achieve, but this is that demonstration of true supremacy, and we're very excited.""
    

        The corresponding market surge ‚Äî¬†which saw D-Wave's stock spike over 8% by market close and sent other quantum companies like IonQ up over 16% ‚Äî¬†helped the industry recover from a dip following recent skepticism from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.
    

        In January, Huang suggested the industry is at least 20 years away from quantum computing being ""very useful,"" sending quantum stocks tumbling.
    

        While D-Wave's announcement didn't fully claw back the losses that followed Huang's remarks, it sent a jolt through the market and made waves in the industry surrounding the burgeoning technology.
    

        Quantum computing is rapidly evolving, with Big Tech players like IBM and Google racing to scale up the devices enough to be commercially useful. While advancement has long been slowed by deeply technical problems involving error correction and scalability,researchers say cracking the code to unlock quantum computing's potential could help discover new drugs, develop new chemical compounds, or¬†break encryption methods, among other outcomes.
    

        That is why D-Wave's announcement, which follows new quantum chip debuts from Amazon Web Services and Microsoft,¬†is such a big deal. The Canadian company says its annealingquantum computer outperformed one of the world's most powerful classical supercomputers when solving complex simulation calculations related to magnetic materials discovery.
    

        The company says its quantum computer performed a magnetic materials simulation in just minutes ‚Äî one that would take a classical supercomputer built with GPU clusters nearly one million years and more than the world's annual electricity consumption to solve.
    

        D-Wave's approach is not without its skeptics. The research paper published by the company's researchers in the journal Science stopped short of describing its findings as ""quantum supremacy,"" instead using the milder term ""quantum advantage"" to outline its findings.
    

        Eric Chitambar, a researcher of quantum information science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, said D-Wave's annealing approach has drawbacks ‚Äî¬†like narrower practical applications and reduced fault tolerance, meaning it's not likely to produce a full-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer.
    

        The narrow scope of the annealingmethod's potential applications is why the other major players in the quantum space have invested heavily in a gate-based approach. This approach relies on quantum logic gates as the foundation of quantum circuits, similar to how classical logic gates operate for conventional circuits. It has the potential for broader applications despite slower progress in development than the annealing approach.
    

        ""But even if they don't have something that is going to be a universal, scalable quantum computer, that doesn't mean there isn't value there,"" Chitambar said of D-Wave's announcement.
    

        Harley Johnson, the chief executive for Illinois Quantum and Microelectronics Park, told Business Insider that certain types of computers are better at solving specific problems. D-Wave's announcement is a prime example of a narrowly tailored machine proving its utility.
    

        But now that quantum computing is moving beyond proving its commercial value, Johnson said, it's time to focus on maximizing the return on the massive investment that has brought the quantum industry this far.
    

        ""The thinking about quantum advantage, or quantum supremacy, needs to take into account the additional information about economic advantage,"" Johnson said. ""What does it cost me to get to a solution on a conventional computer versus on a quantum computer? Can I solve it more cheaply than I could solve it on a conventional computer? I think that's the next really important way to think about quantum advantage.""

President Donald Trump might not drink, but his trade war is shaking and stirring up the market for some of the most popular boozy beverages globally.

        On Wednesday, the European Union responded to US tariffs on aluminum and steel by imposing a 50% duty on various products starting on April 1, including one of the US's most well-known drinks: whiskey.
    

        Just a day later, Trump threatened a 200% tariff on wine and alcohol from EU countries, including iconic French Champagne. It's unclear when or if that levy will take effect, but it's already prompting reactions in the US.
    

        Some wine shops, for instance, are promoting specials for customers who want to stock up on European wine, with one in New York City sending out emails to regular customers offering ""tariff buster"" deals.
    

        Alexandra Ivanac and her husband Stephen Varela, who run the Italian-Croatian restaurant Villa Berulia in Manhattan, said Trump's threats are ""alarming."" The restaurant carries about 75 European wines and upcharges alcohol 2.5 to 3 times, higher than many dishes.
    

        ""How does an Italian restaurant pivot away from European wine?"" Varela said.
    

        It's making them question whether to absorb the costs or pass them on to customers. Ivanac said they may instead look to South America, South Africa, Australia, or New Zealand for wines if the tariffs go into effect, as well as some California wines. Varela also said they may order twice as much wine as normal and stockpile it in their basement.
    

        ""Some of these wines are going for, on the higher end, $200 to $300, so how much could we really increase prices?"" Varela said, adding some customers are more cautious about spending given economic concerns.
    

        The US accounts for about 31% of EU wine and spirit exports, according to Eurostat, the EU statistics office. The EU, meanwhile, made up about 40% of the export market for US spirits in 2023, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States.
    

        For US winemakers, the latest tariff threat could be an opportunity.
    

        Zach Pelka, cofounder and COO at New York-based Une Femme Wines, said his company developed a supply chain that sits almost entirely within the US after COVID made sourcing abroad more complicated and expensive.
    

        Pelka said he expects more US-based alcohol brands to focus domestically if Trump's 200% tariff takes effect.
    

        If the US's threats come true, Pelka expects that Une Femme will become a more attractive option for restaurants, retailers, hotels, and other customers who want a steady source of wine in the US.
    

        ""As of today, I think it becomes the focal point of the pitch"" to buyers, he said of the potential tariff.
    

        Tariff talk has already caused consumers in other countries to buy from local suppliers instead of importing from the US. Many Canadians are looking for ""Made in Canada"" alternatives in light of the levies that the Trump administration has threatened and enacted on that country's goods.
    

        Whether any or all of the taxes materialize remains to be seen. Last week, Trump imposed a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico ‚Äî only to suspend it shortly afterward for most items until April 2.
    

        Even if the tariffs take effect, drinkers might not see higher prices right away.
    

        Blake Leonard, president of wine at Stew Leonard's Wine & Spirits, which operates several shops in Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York, told BI that some of her suppliers brought months' worth of European wine and even tequila from Mexico into the US to get ahead of potential tariffs.
    

        That early action will help Stew Leonard's keep prices for many beverages stable, at least temporarily. ""The last thing we want to do as a family business is raise prices for our customers,"" Leonard said. About half of all wine that the chain sells comes from European nations ‚Äî primarily France and Italy, she said.
    

        To say the situation is fluid ""would be a massive understatement,"" said Lawson Whiting, the CEO of Brown-Forman, which makes Jack Daniel's whiskey and counts Europe as a major export market. ""It seems like things are changing very, very quickly.""
    

        The April 1 effective date for the EU's tariffs on US whiskey leaves time for the US and the EU to resolve their differences, Whiting said at an industry conference on Wednesday, the day the EU announced its latest tariffs.
    

        ""That does give me some optimism that both the administration and the other counterparties over the last few weeks have been trying to resolve things,"" Whiting said.

The automaker plans to offer electric, hybrid, and gas versions of the upcoming model ‚Äî all built on the new MMA platform.
by  Abigail Bassett
Mercedes-Benz‚Äôs electric vehicles aren‚Äôt exactly selling like hotcakes. The EQS, EQE, and EQB have largely flopped, forcing the company to make significant changes to its electrification plans. 
While the automaker has scaled back its ambitions, it‚Äôs not abandoning them altogether. As Mercedes-Benz Group CEO Ola K√§llenius said during the company‚Äôs Tech Day in Stuttgart, Germany, last month, ‚ÄúThe clock starts again‚Äù on the company‚Äôs EV plans. And that starts with a newly developed platform, called MMA, that will underpin both internal combustion, hybrid, and electric vehicles going forward.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in an era where we‚Äôre going towards electrification, but in the year 2025 obviously, we‚Äôre not 100 percent electrification. So for many years to come we will have a duality,‚Äù K√§llenius said.
The MMA platform makes its debut on the company‚Äôs entry-level sedan, the CLA, which debuted as a sub $30,000 Mercedes in 2013. Typically, automakers introducing new platforms start with their priciest models, which would be the S- and G-Class models in Mercedes‚Äô case. Since both of those vehicles were recently updated, it will be a while before they get the MMA treatment. 
Mercedes is also bucking the traditional method of introducing a new platform as an ICE vehicle and then wedging the design into an EV platform. Instead, the company is going ‚ÄúEV first,‚Äù launching the CLA as an EV first and then later as an internal combustion with a mild hybrid in 2026. 
The new platform makes both the hybrid and EV vehicles larger than the previous generation. The wheelbase is 6.1 cm longer (2.4 inches) to accommodate the battery pack and taller by 2.8 cm (1.1 inches), giving rear passengers slightly more legroom and height. K√§llenius acknowledged the old CLA was a tight fit in the rear, but at 6-foot-4, he was able to slide into the new CLA with ease. As K√§llenius said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre buying what feels like a sports car, but at the same time you have a fully functional three-box sedan.‚Äù
The new CLA owes its design and tech to the EQXX, a concept car introduced by Mercedes in 2022 with an emphasis on efficiency that could roll for more than 1,000 miles on a single charge. Mercedes engineers spent three years leveraging what they learned from the EQXX to develop the revamped CLA. 
However, the biggest deal about the new CLA is its massive range. There will be two battery options for the global market, a 58.4 kWh version and a larger 85.5 kWh battery. The US will only get the larger of the two, giving the CLA an estimated range of 792 km (492 miles) based on the generous WLTP standards. If the EPA-estimated range comes in around 350 miles, the CLA will rank among other long-range EVs like Lucid, Rivian, and Tesla.
The new CLA also gets a unique brake-by-wire setup called OneBox that calculates the right amount of braking power and recuperation to maximize efficiency. Like the technology BMW developed for its VDX test vehicle, most braking will primarily be handled by the regeneration system in normal conditions. The new system claims to recuperate up to 200 kW of power. 
The new CLA‚Äôs 800-volt architecture will enable ultra-fast charging, adding 300 km (186 miles) of range in 10 minutes. The EV will come in front-wheel and all-wheel drive trims, with a 268-hp drive unit on the rear axle and a 107-hp drive unit on the front in the all-wheel drive version. The front motor can be disengaged automatically when it is not needed to help increase efficiency. As K√§llenius noted, ‚ÄúThis is the EQXX on the road.‚Äù 
With the CLA, Mercedes is launching a new software stack called MB.OS. The infotainment MBUX system will run on MB.OS and offers a new ‚ÄúAI-enhanced‚Äù user experience that can control everything from the sensors to various actuators. The new MB.OS system will be connected to the cloud to enable over-the-air updates for everything from driver assistance features to semi-autonomous driving. 
K√§llenius said the CLA will feature ‚ÄúLevel 2 ++‚Äù driving ‚Äì nearing Level 3 autonomy where the driver is still kept in the loop to take over when needed. (Mercedes already offers a Level 3 system in a handful of states called Drive Pilot.) Consumers can purchase or ‚Äúunlock‚Äù these ADAS features as an upgrade after purchase, which will be delivered via OTA update. 
‚ÄúIt will age like a good French wine,‚Äù K√§llenius said of the new software stack. ‚ÄúIt will get better with age, because we will add capabilities to it. Some things we will give you for free, some things we may charge you for, depending on what it is, and depending on what the market allows.‚Äù
The new CLA gets Mercedes‚Äô Superscreen, which stretches from pillar to pillar in the front. Under that glass sits a 10.25-inch gauge cluster and a 14-inch center display, with an optional 14-inch screen for passengers. That passenger screen can play movies from platforms like YouTube and RideVu by Sony. And if you‚Äôre worried about distracted driving, the passenger screen is not viewable from the driver‚Äôs position. 
Google and Microsoft systems help power the AI, which can be used to determine a driver‚Äôs mood (which it then uses to change the color of the lighting in the car) or help find parking. I got a demonstration of the new Mercedes voice assistant, which is powered by Google Gemini, and found it to be much more conversational than the previous generation, handling basic requests like navigation or finding a nice restaurant. For general knowledge, the system uses OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4o model, Microsoft‚Äôs Azure, and Bing. The system will remember previous conversations and recall context. All the predictive learning is done on board the vehicle, not in the cloud.
‚ÄúIt will age like a good French wine.‚Äù
Mercedes will launch the electric CLA (the base version is awkwardly named the CLA 250+ with EQ Technology) first in China and Europe, with the US launch in the fall. For an upgrade, customers can get the even more awkwardly named CLA 350 4MATIC with EQ Technology, with all-wheel drive. The 1.5-liter four-cylinder hybrid ICE version, which Mercedes didn‚Äôt share many details about in Stuttgart, won‚Äôt make its debut until sometime in 2026. 
Mercedes hasn‚Äôt announced pricing yet, but in the current economic environment, it‚Äôs likely that the new CLA will be priced above that old $30,000 marker. With increased hostility toward EVs in the US and an administration that‚Äôs determined to roll back EV benefits, we‚Äôll have to wait and see which version Mercedes customers choose for their future entry-level luxury sedan, and whether this new electric strategy will turn the company‚Äôs flagging sales around.

The backlight tech is just a concept for now, but it could lead to more detailed displays without the drawbacks of OLED.
by  Sam Byford
Today Sony is announcing the development of a new type of TV display that uses individual RGB LEDs for its backlighting. While Sony currently sells high-end Mini LED TVs alongside OLED models, this new system could combine many of the best qualities of both, and I recently got to see it in action at the company‚Äôs Tokyo headquarters.
I‚Äôm not yet convinced that this tech, which for now Sony has given the somewhat unwieldy name of ‚ÄúGeneral RGB LED Backlight Technology,‚Äù will be the best panel solution for everyone. But TVs are always going to come with tradeoffs, and this approach does represent a meaningfully different solution to what‚Äôs currently on the market. It looks like it‚Äôll be a huge upgrade on existing Mini LED sets.
Mini LED TVs work by deploying an array of tiny blue LEDs behind the panel. These LEDs are larger than the actual pixels on the display, but they‚Äôre small enough that the TV can brighten or darken multiple areas of the screen with a high degree of precision. OLED TVs, meanwhile, are capable of even better contrast because they light up and switch off each pixel individually, but they generally can‚Äôt get as large or as bright as Mini LED displays.
With Sony‚Äôs new RGB LED method, each Mini LED backlight zone is made up of a red, green, and blue LED. The core advantage here is that Sony is able to achieve finer control over color without compromising on brightness, achieving a level of 4000 cd/m¬≤ ‚Äî on par with the company‚Äôs professional reference monitors and resulting in a higher ‚Äúcolor volume‚Äù than any commercial TV it‚Äôs released to date. The increased gradation control can also help deliver much wider viewing angles than Mini LED TVs, and Sony says the panels can be built at larger sizes than existing OLED sets.
So, how does it look in person? Unfortunately Sony didn‚Äôt allow its prototypes to be photographed, but I‚Äôll do my best to describe them.
The first unit was designed to show off the backlight array itself. Behind the set was a wild combination of exposed silicon and cable spaghetti. Only half of the screen was covered by an actual LCD panel; the rest of the image was purely handled by the backlighting. Imagine watching a movie where the right half of the picture was run through a 16-bit pixel art filter, and you‚Äôre pretty much there, except this screen had much better color reproduction than a Super Nintendo. 
This isn‚Äôt much use in practice, of course, but it does show exactly how precise Sony is able to get with the lighting. One scene showed a bus driving down a street on a sunny day, and it was possible to discern several distinct shades of red in its paint from the backlight alone. Sony says this translates to wider and more accurate color reproduction.
To demonstrate actual video content, Sony set up a full-screen version of the RGB backlight prototype flanked by two of its best TVs you can buy: last year‚Äôs extravagant Mini LED-powered Bravia 9, and the QD-OLED A95L that won the prestigious ‚ÄúKing of TV‚Äù award at the most recent Value Electronics TV Shootout, where Verge editor-in-chief Nilay Patel served on the judging panel.
Conscious of the unflattering comparison, a Sony engineer conducting the demo repeatedly went out of his way to make the point that the Bravia 9 on the left really was a very good TV. Despite this, the RGB LED prototype clearly smoked it. 
A scene from Frozen where blue crystals flew through the air looked almost monochrome in comparison, with the prototype revealing deep shades of purple that simply weren‚Äôt there on the Bravia. It was clear how the backlighting worked in tandem with the color grading to deliver a more vivid picture. Viewing angles were hugely improved, with near-non-existent color shift. Another sequence with bright red lights against a dark background exhibited the tell-tale blueish Mini LED blooming on the Bravia, whereas the RGB LED prototype lit up those areas solely in red. 
That‚Äôs not to say the blooming wasn‚Äôt there. If you covered up only the red portion of the screen with a piece of paper, you‚Äôd still see hazy redness around it, unlike on an OLED panel. But watching the footage normally, the effect wasn‚Äôt all that different. While OLED screens don‚Äôt strictly leak color data into adjacent pixels, the effect of retinal straylight in your eyes means you do still perceive haziness around bright points. RGB LED‚Äôs ability to limit its blooming to scene-accurate colors makes for a major improvement on Mini LED in this regard, even if it‚Äôs still going to lose out to OLED when it comes to displaying starfields.
RGB LED backlighting isn‚Äôt a wholly new idea, even from Sony. The company launched a ridiculously expensive Qualia TV with an RGB backlight in 2004, and more recently showed off a ‚ÄúCrystal LED‚Äù prototype TV at CES 2012. Competitors are also on the case; Hisense showed off a ‚ÄúTriChroma RGB Backlight‚Äù Mini LED TV at CES this year, while TCL and Samsung had prototypes with their own spin on the idea.
‚ÄúThese developments were within our expectations,‚Äù says Daisuke Nezu, head of Sony‚Äôs home audio and video division. Sony remains confident that its experience in backlight technology and image signal processing gives it an edge over anything on the horizon.
‚ÄúWe believe that we can ensure not only good image quality, but also reliability and stability,‚Äù Sony representative Mara Redican tells The Verge, emphasizing the company‚Äôs expertise in signal processing. ‚ÄúThe knowledge and experience gained over the years cannot be easily replicated.‚Äù
If Sony is right about this, its strongest competition could be coming from inside the house; the advantages were much less clear next to its own ‚ÄúKing of TV.‚Äù The RGB LED prototype could definitely hang with the A95L, and quite literally outshone it in terms of brightness. But I would say the difference in color reproduction and viewing angles were a wash at best. I generally preferred the picture from the OLED in the most challenging comparisons, and I think a lot of OLED TV owners would probably agree.
But that‚Äôs fine by Sony, which isn‚Äôt giving any indication that it‚Äôs planning to exit the OLED TV market any time soon ‚Äî no wonder, given the glowing reception to the A95L. I might be happy with my own OLED TVs right now, but the tech plainly isn‚Äôt right for every customer, whether they‚Äôre concerned about brightness, size, or longevity. If you‚Äôve been waiting to put a 100-inch-plus panel in a large room with a lot of natural light, this could be your answer.
We‚Äôll have to see how this all shakes out once RGB LED panels come to actual consumer TVs, of course. But Sony‚Äôs take on the concept does look to be a big step up over what we‚Äôve come to expect from Mini LED, at least, and it could well be the best alternative to OLED if and when it‚Äôs commercialized.

17,2025-03-13,"The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell slightly last week, indicating a still-healthy U.S. labor market
The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell slightly last week, indicating a still-healthy U.S. labor market.
U.S. jobless claims filings fell by 2,000 to 220,000 for the week ending March 8, the Labor Department said Thursday. That‚Äôs fewer than the 226,000 new applications analysts forecast.
It‚Äôs not clear when job cuts ordered by the Department of Government Efficiency will show up in the weekly layoffs report, though some analysts expect them to surface in data in the coming weeks.
Those layoffs are part of the Trump administration‚Äôs efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce through billionaire Elon Musk‚Äôs Department of Government Efficiency. 
Senior U.S. officials set the government downsizing in motion weeks ago via a memo dramatically expanding President Donald Trump‚Äôs efforts to scale back the workforce. Thousands of probationary employees have already been fired, and now the Republican administration is turning its attention to career officials with civil service protection.
Despite showing some signs of weakening during the past year, the labor market remains healthy with plentiful jobs and relatively few layoffs.
The Labor Department reported that U.S. employers added a solid 151,000 jobs last month, with employment rising in healthcare, finance and transportation and warehousing. The unemployment rate ticked up to a still-healthy 4.1%.
Overall, while layoffs remain low by historical standards, some high-profile companies have announced job cuts already this year.
Workday, Dow, CNN, Starbucks, Southwest Airlines and Facebook parent company Meta have all trimmed their workforces already in 2025.
Weekly applications for jobless benefits are considered a proxy for layoffs, and have remained mostly in a range between 200,000 and 250,000 for the past few years.
The four-week average, which evens out some of the week-to-week swings, ticked up by 1,500 to 226,000.
The total number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits for the week of March 1 fell by 27,000 to 1.87 million.

18,2025-03-13,"Majority of Americans disapprove of Trump‚Äôs economic management amid stock market turmoil, polls show.
United States President Donald Trump‚Äôs handling of the economy is facing growing pushback from Americans amid wild swings in the stock market and growing fears of a recession, new polling shows.
In a CNN/SSRS poll released on Wednesday, 56 percent of respondents said they disapproved of Trump‚Äôs economic management ‚Äì higher than at any point during his first term in office.
The poll had better news for Trump on his other signature issue of immigration, with 51 percent of respondents expressing support for his strict enforcement policies.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll also released on Wednesday found that 57 percent of Americans believe Trump‚Äôs economic policies have been too ‚Äúerratic‚Äù.
Trump‚Äôs overall approval rating in the CNN and Reuters polls was 45 percent and 44 percent, respectively.
The results come as Trump‚Äôs back-and-forth announcements on tariffs have roiled markets and stoked tensions with trading partners, including key US allies.
The benchmark S&P 500 has lost more than $3 trillion since its February peak as investors struggle to make sense of the US president‚Äôs ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù economic agenda.
On Wednesday, the Trump administration imposed 25 percent tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports, prompting retaliatory duties from Canada and the European Union.
The latest tariffs came after Trump a day earlier threatened Canada with a 50 percent duty on steel and aluminium before reversing course after the province of Ontario agreed to suspend a surcharge on electricity exports to some US states.
Trump, who earlier this week declined to rule out the possibility of a recession this year, and his aides have played down the stock market turmoil as a temporary blip on the road to a stronger economy.
‚ÄúI think this country is going to boom. But as I said, I can do it the easy way or the hard way,‚Äù Trump told reporters on Tuesday.
‚ÄúThe hard way to do it is exactly what I am doing, but the results are going to be 20 times greater.‚Äù

20,2025-03-13,"The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) on Wednesday issued its final verdict on the state of the country's mobile browser market, and the regulator has concluded that Apple's policies are largely responsible for hampering competition and innovation.
The CMA's independent inquiry group's investigation found that Apple's requirement for all iOS browsers to use its WebKit engine is stifling competition, and effectively prevents rival browsers from introducing unique features or optimizations on iPhones and iPads, regardless of their capabilities on other platforms.
The full report outlines several problematic Apple practices beyond the WebKit requirement, including giving Safari preferential access to iOS features compared to competing browsers, imposing limitations on in-app browsing, and prominently displaying Safari as the pre-installed default browser on all iPhones.
Google also came under scrutiny for pre-installing Chrome on Android devices, but the investigation found that Apple's restrictions were more fundamental to market competition. The CMA also flagged the lucrative arrangement where Google pays Apple billions annually to remain the default search engine on iOS devices, noting this deal ""significantly reduces their financial incentives to compete.""
Both companies have made some concessions since the CMA published its preliminary findings last November. The report acknowledges these improvements have ""addressed some, but not all, of the concerns relating to choice architecture,"" specifically mentioning Apple's December software update that modified how users can change default browsers.
However, to address the remaining issues, the regulator proposed several potential remedies including forcing Apple to allow alternative browser engines on iOS, implementing browser choice screens during device setup (similar to the one found in the EU), and restricting the revenue-sharing search deal between Apple and Google.
These recommendations aren't immediately enforceable, as the CMA is first proceeding with separate investigations to determine whether Apple and Google should be designated with ""strategic market status"" (SMS) under the UK's Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act. The designation is expected to be decided later this year, and would give the CMA authority to impose stricter regulations on the companies.
If granted SMS designation, Apple and Google could face legally binding conduct requirements and risk substantial penalties ‚Äî up to 10% of their annual global turnover ‚Äî for violations.
The cloud gaming portion of the investigation, which had previously raised concerns about Apple's App Store restrictions, concluded that ""no further action is necessary"" following policy changes Apple made during the course of the investigation.
The UK report follows similar scrutiny from other global regulators, including the European Commission and the United States Department of Justice, which are also examining mobile browser competition.

U.S. stocks tumbled on Thursday, deepening losses suffered since the outbreak of a trade war set off by President Donald Trump's tariffs.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 535 points, or 1.3%, while the S&P 500 dropped 1.4%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq declined nearly 2%.
The S&P 500 closed down more than 10% since a peak attained last month, meaning the decline officially qualified as a market correction. It marked the index's first correction since October 2023.
Trading opened minutes after Trump threatened a 200% tariff on champagne and other alcohol products from the European Union, escalating a global trade war that has roiled markets.
Hours later, Trump stood firm on his tariff plans. ""I'm not going to bend at all,"" he told reporters at the White House.
Tesla, the electric carmaker run by Elon Musk, fell about 5.5% in early trading on Thursday. The decline erased some gains from Wednesday, a day after Trump announced plans to purchase Tesla vehicles at an event at the White House. Tesla's stock value has fallen just over 40% this year.
A continued back-and-forth over international tariffs is hanging over the U.S. economy, along with a looming government shutdown with a deadline on Friday.
Federal officials said Wednesday that consumer prices climbed 2.8% in February over the same year-earlier month, meaning inflation cooled more than economists expected.
After initially modest gains, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed on Wednesday down about 0.2%, while the S&P 500 climbed 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq increased 1.2%.

Reid Hoffman has dismissed the idea that he has a personal ""beef"" with Elon Musk, saying their ongoing feud is one-sided.

        Speaking on BBC Radio 4 on Thursday, the LinkedIn cofounder and early OpenAI donor said Musk was still bitter over OpenAI's success after his departure. Musk left OpenAI in early 2018.
    

        ""Well, so actually, it's more his beef with me for having made OpenAI successful with his departure,"" Hoffman said. ""Because he left saying, you know, 'You're all a bunch of jackasses and you'll fail,' and I helped them succeed.""
    

        Hoffman added that AI should be developed by those willing to ""consult with and deal with other people"" ‚Äî something he said Musk doesn't do. ""That's not how Elon operates, which anyone who has two eyes can see,"" he said.
    

        The latest clash between the two played out over the weekend on X, the social media platform Musk owns. Musk claimed that Hoffman was among several donors funding Tesla protests.
    

        ""An investigation has found 5 ActBlue-funded groups responsible for Tesla 'protests,'"" Musk wrote on Saturday, listing Hoffman alongside George Soros and other political donors.

But it's clear Americans are angry at him‚Äîit's easier to explain away their anger than to accept that actions have consequences.""Musk replied: ""Describe your favorite island vacation.""
    

        Hoffman shot back with a graph of Tesla's stock price decline, writing: ""I don't know about islands but here's your least favorite mountain.""

        Tesla stock closed down 15% on Monday, dragging Musk's net worth down by $29 billion ‚Äî a 6.7% drop in a single day. Despite the hit, Musk remains the world's richest person.
    

        Hoffman and Musk were both early OpenAI backers. Hoffman, who remained a supporter of OpenAI after Musk's departure, has been a vocal critic of Musk's actions. In September 2024, he dismissed Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI as ""sour grapes,"" suggesting Musk was frustrated by the company's success without him.
    

        Last month, Musk led a $97.4 billion bid to take control of OpenAI, which the company's board swiftly rejected.

One number from Adobe's quarterly earnings on Wednesday caught investors' attention: annual recurring revenue from AI.

        At $125 million from the first quarter this year, it's a small slice of Adobe's $5.71 billion in total quarterly revenue. But analysts were quick to talk about the breakout number on Wednesday's earnings call.
    

        Shantanu Narayen, Adobe's CEO, said on the call that the company expects to double its AI ARR by the end of the financial year.
    

        ""Whether it is innovation, having our own models, integrating it across all of our products, brand new revenue streams like GenStudio in the enterprise and then usage and monetization, I feel really good about it,"" Narayen said on the call. 
    

        The company said it expects revenue to increase to between $5.77 billion and $5.82 billion in the second quarter.
    

        Adobe's stock dipped 4.5% in after-hours trading, extending a rough year that has seen shares slide 23%, even as the S&P 500 climbed 8%.
    

        As AI spending surges, investors are watching closely to see if tech companies can turn big bets into real returns. 
    

        Narayen said on the earnings call that future info on AI's ARR would be released ""periodically"" ‚Äî not quarterly.
    

        In a research note ahead of earnings, Gregg Moskowitz, a managing director at Mizuho, wrote, ""Adobe is unquestionably a frustrating stock in 2024."" 
    

        He wrote that analysts remain optimistic that Adobe would successfully monetize its generative AI offerings and see strong growth in ARR and revenue guidance for the financial year.
    

        Equity analysts from Jefferies said in a report published on Sunday that chief information officers they surveyed expect their companies' spend on Adobe's creative software to accelerate in 2025.
    

        The surveys included 15 chief information officers and 40 end users. The report said that Adobe's AI offerings are ""competitive"" and that ""fears of AI reducing the need for Adobe may be overblown.""
    

        Of end users surveyed, 65% told Jefferies their use of Adobe's creative software would increase within the next three years, while 50% evaluated Adobe's AI offerings ""as better than competitors.""
    

        Adobe did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider, sent outside business hours.

        Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday said he‚Äôs ‚Äúnot concerned about a little bit of volatility.‚Äù

While the last three weeks have been punishing for the stock market, veteran wealth managers are sounding a similar refrain for long-term investors: don‚Äôt panic.
It can be difficult advice to heed when alarming headlines are regularly flooding the news. Two days after the S&P 500 index hit its all-time high on February 19, hedge fund billionaire Steve Cohen made a prescient prediction that he wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see a ‚Äúsignificant correction‚Äù in the stock market, calling tariffs an additional tax. On Tuesday this week, JPMorgan economists raised their recession risk forecast for this year to 40% from 30%. The S&P 500 is down 9% from its high and seems destined to fall further.
But history suggests changes in sentiment often happen much faster than investors expect. Just last year, when stocks fell 8.5% over three weeks in July and August, those losses were erased within a month. The same is true of the S&P 500‚Äôs last 10% correction, which took place from July to October 2023.
In fact, Dave Donabedian, co-chief investment officer of CIBC Private Wealth U.S., which manages $87 billion in assets, says his firm researched ‚Äútrue crises‚Äù far more consequential than the current self-inflicted declines fueled by tariffs‚Äîshocks to the system like outbreaks of war or the onset of Covid-19.
‚ÄúWhat you find is that about two-thirds of the time, the S&P 500 has recovered all that it lost after the shock in a month,‚Äù says Donabedian. ‚ÄúThe punch line is don‚Äôt do knee-jerk selling, and we‚Äôve certainly had some of those conversations in the last week or so.‚Äù
The primary culprit for the current stock market swoon is the uncertainty caused by President Donald Trump‚Äôs imposition of tariffs on imports from China, Canada and Mexico. Trump initially announced the tariffs over the weekend prior to February 3, but when the market opened that day down 2%, he changed course and granted Mexico and Canada a temporary 30-day reprieve following concessions they made to secure their borders with the U.S. Stocks quickly rebounded.
That pause expired with Trump allowing the tariffs to take effect on March 4, but he soon carved out exemptions for some goods subject to a trade agreement he signed during his first term. Since then, investors have become increasingly dismayed at Trump‚Äôs uncharacteristic indifference to the stock market‚Äîlast Thursday, he told reporters he‚Äôs ‚Äúnot even looking at the market.‚Äù This week, he walked back a threat to hike tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum imports to 50%, but added a 25% charge on those metals shipped from any foreign country, leading to retaliatory tariffs imposed by the European Union on U.S. imports. The whipsawing is only adding to investors‚Äô uneasiness.
‚ÄúWe knew tariffs were negative for economies, but it‚Äôs less the impact of the tariffs themselves than the uncertainty of the policy,‚Äù says Adrian Helfert, chief investment officer for alternative and multi-asset portfolios at Westwood. ‚ÄúSmall and mid-sized businesses need to know what to expect so they can plan their capital expenditures. Uncertainty leads to businesses that are nervous to plan for a future that they don‚Äôt know.‚Äù
More clarity shouldn‚Äôt be particularly hard to provide, and while Donabedian contends it would be ‚Äúfoolish‚Äù to make a short-term prediction about whether the next piece of news is better or worse for investors, the perceived risk of the tariffs could peak within the next couple of months. ‚ÄúOur view is still that we get a year of slow growth, but not a recession,‚Äù he says.
And there‚Äôs reason for optimism elsewhere in the economy. Inflation eased to 2.8% in February, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Wednesday, slightly lower than consensus expectations, which improved hopes that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year. The S&P 500 crawled 0.5% higher yesterday, resisting the downward trend and signaling that a broader rebound could be on tap if the tariff issue gets resolved.
The top-performing S&P sector Wednesday was information technology, which gained 1.6% despite being one of the index‚Äôs largest laggards of the year, illustrating how quickly trends can reverse. Selling off parts of portfolios that look precarious could backfire if news changes quickly.
‚ÄúFor your average retail investor, the temptation is to say ‚ÄòI've got to do something‚Äô during times like this, when the reality is, if you're a long term investor, often your best decision is to stay out of your own way,‚Äù says Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors. ‚ÄúUnfortunately in this country, we've got far more people that aren't saving enough or investing enough in preparation for their retirement than those that are over-saving or over-investing.‚Äù
Some strategists even see this as a time to buy into parts of the market that have underperformed if investors do have extra cash. The Russell 2000 index tracking small-cap stocks is down 17% from its post-election high and has hardly budged since the end of 2020, while large caps have enjoyed stronger gains for the last two years.
‚ÄúIf somebody were all in on the S&P 500, I might counsel a little more diversification there, to maybe look at some things in the small- and mid-cap space or look at international, which has finally started to outperform the U.S.,‚Äù says Donabedian. Since Trump took office in January, Chinese stocks as measured by MSCI China are up 22%, and MSCI Europe has gained 9%. The S&P 500 is down nearly 7% over the same period. Says Donabedian, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an opportunity to pick some spots in the equity markets that have underperformed for a number of years.‚Äù"
26,2025-03-13,"Samsung‚Äôs next Unpacked event is expected in July, and while the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7 are the main attractions, Samsung might have another surprise: a pair of earbuds that let you listen to music in all its fidelity without compromising your ability to hear. Digital Chat Station and Ice Universe, both reliable tipsters, shared the news on Weibo and listed the upcoming earbuds as ‚Äúbone conduction‚Äù buds.
However, both sources also call these open wireless stereo (OWS) earbuds. This style of earbud usually transmits audio into the ear canal with air rather than through vibrations. While it isn‚Äôt entirely clear what Samsung has cooking, it seems likely the tech giant has a new project in the works.
OWS earbuds are popular with runners, cyclists, and people who need to keep an ear on their surroundings while they work out. These allow the wearer to listen to music without putting something in their ears and compromising their ability to hear approaching traffic.
The Galaxy Buds are a popular alternative to AirPods for Android users. The buds offer sound quality on par with high-end earbuds, a comfortable fit, and numerous features that make them an easy go-to. If Samsung‚Äôs new earbuds match or exceed the quality of the Galaxy Buds, then they will have no problem finding an audience.
The new earbuds are expected to debut at the next Unpacked event alongside the new handsets. The information we currently have is limited, but if recent trends are any indication, more leaks will emerge as the event draws near.
Another benefit of this announcement is that it could make bone-conduction earbuds ‚Äî usually a higher-priced item ‚Äî more accessible, especially as more companies begin to enter that section of the market.
Samsung has released a new 8K TV and it's the company's biggest Neo QLED so far. The 98-inch class Samsung QN990C Neo QLED 8K TV¬†can be ordered starting September 6 from samsung.com for an eye-watering $40,000.
As you'd expect for this kind of investment, Samsung has thrown all of its best TV tech at this giant 8K screen. Its Neural Quantum Processor uses AI-based formulas to upscale any content to 8K. It uses a full array local dimming (FALD) mini-LED backlight system with quantum dots, which can deliver more than a billion colors and high contrast, with support for HDR10+. With a stated peak brightness of about 2,000 nits, the QN990C should have no trouble making HDR material look its best.
If you had told me 20 years ago ‚Äî or, heck, even 15 ‚Äî that Samsung and LG were going to be the top TV brands in the U.S., I‚Äôd have laughed in your face. But I feel like I‚Äôve learned to see the writing on the wall since then. And now I‚Äôm wondering: Are TCL and Hisense the next Samsung and LG?
If we take a look at TCL and Hisense's 2023 TV lineups, their recently inked partnerships with huge national sports organizations, and their progress over the last five years in terms of both technological advancement and sales, I think there's a strong argument in favor of TCL and Hisense becoming the top two TV brands in the U.S.
TCL in 2023
We‚Äôll start with TCL‚Äôs 2023 TV lineup. You already know about the QM8 Mini-LED,¬† right? If not, you have got to check out that TV. But what else does TCL have in store? Well, there‚Äôs the Q7, which, while not a mini-LED TV, does have a full-array local dimming backlight system, quantum dots, high brightness with 1,000 nits peak, and a slate of other desirable features. Plus, the 65-inch model, for price reference, is $1,000. Now, in case you don‚Äôt recall, last year‚Äôs 6-Series, the R655, was a mini-LED TV, and the 65-inch version of that TV sold for $1,000.
Traditionally, drivers -- the tiny speakers that live inside our wired and wireless earbuds -- are made from various materials like paper, copper, and magnets. Manufacturing them often involves human hands. And it's not unusual for earbud makers to include multiple drivers in one earbud to achieve the full frequency response they're looking for. Now though, xMEMS Labs has developed an entirely different type of driver that uses the same silicon material found in microchips and is created using the same fully automated manufacturing process.
The company has announced that in addition to its Montara -- the world's first MEMS micro speaker -- it's rolling out two new models: the Cowell, a MEMS drive that can be paired with a dynamic drive, and the Montara Plus, a high-performance device intended for audiophile-grade in-ear monitors (IEMs). All three models are as much as three times smaller than the smallest equivalent traditional driver, which could make them an excellent choice for hearing aids, as well as music-listening devices.

27,2025-03-13,"A report from a UK antitrust body, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), has found that Apple and Google have such dominance over the mobile browser market that it is harming users who could be missing out on new features. With 88% of Apple users running Safari and 77% of Android users running Chrome, the situation is ‚Äúnot working well for consumers and businesses‚Äù and is ‚Äúholding back innovation,‚Äù the CMA says, and it singles out Apple‚Äôs mobile browser policies for particular criticism.
Apple has previously been criticized for its restrictive policies around mobile browsers, as users can install browsers other than Apple‚Äôs Safari on their devices ‚Äî but those browsers can only use Apple‚Äôs WebKit engine. That makes them essentially overlays for Apple‚Äôs own browser, limiting the features that can be supported on a mobile browser.
As for Google, the report criticized a revenue-sharing agreement between Google and Apple, in which Google pays Apple a chunk of its search revenue from users browsing on an iOS device. This agreement gives both companies a reason not to compete, the report says, which harms users.
The report does offer suggestions on improving the situation, such as forcing Apple to allow browser engines other than WebKit or banning the revenue-sharing agreement between Apple and Google. However, it doesn‚Äôt look like these suggestions will be put into action any time soon as the CMA is still undertaking a separate investigation into Apple and Google‚Äôs mobile dominance, which is expected to be completed later this year.
‚ÄúFollowing our in-depth investigation, we have concluded that competition between different mobile browsers is not working well, and this is holding back innovation in the UK,‚Äù said Margot Daly, Chair of the CMA‚Äôs independent inquiry group.
‚ÄúThe analysis set out in our report and the range of potential interventions considered to address the market issues we have identified merits consideration by the CMA under its new powers, which have been specifically designed for digital markets. So, I welcome the CMA‚Äôs prompt action to open strategic market status investigations into both Apple and Google‚Äôs mobile ecosystems. The extensive analysis we‚Äôve set out today will help that work as it progresses.‚Äù
In 2022, Mark Gurman warned that Apple was considering putting advertisements in Apple Maps (and in other areas of the iPhone), but that ultimately didn't happen. Now it looks like Apple is revisiting the idea, according to Gurman's most recent Power On! newsletter.
Apple already shows ads in the Apple News and Stocks app, and Gurman says ""Apple is giving this notion more thought."" The company said it's exploring potential monetization avenues, but there are no concrete plans or a timeline yet.
The TikTok saga continues. Apple reinstated the popular app to the App Store on Thursday evening, and a short while later Google followed suit and put it back on the Play Store. The move came after Attorney General Pam Bondi reportedly sent a letter to the tech giants assuring them that they will not face any penalties in relation to a law that banned the app in the U.S. last month.
Both Apple and Google removed TikTok from their respective U.S. app stores on January 18, the day before the law banning the app went into effect. Then, on January 20, newly elected President Trump signed an executive order granting TikTok a 75-day reprieve from the ban to give his administration ‚Äúan opportunity to determine the appropriate course forward.‚Äù
It's been five years since the Apple TV app was launched, and we're now getting a version for Android devices -- built from the ground up for native Android integration -- in the Google Play store that will have the same Apple TV+ functionality as the Apple ecosystem version. The new app means users with Android OS 10 or later will finally have the ability to sign up for Apple TV+ on their Android-based phones and tablets to watch shows and movies like Severance, Silo, Killers of the Flower Moon, and CODA. There will be no difference in pricing on Android compared to Apple.
This should enable seamless interactivity across platforms for features such as Continue Watching -- which keeps track of where you are in a show or movie and allows you to pick up from that spot when you return, regardless of the device you watch on. Customer's Watchlist will be kept up to date across devices as well, and since purchases are linked to your Apple account, all the content you own will be accessible on any device with the new updated app. One thing missing at launch, though, will be the ability to cast Apple TV content from your Android device.

Is Trump torching the economy? Here‚Äôs what the numbers say.
by  Nicole Narea
Candidate Donald Trump promised an economic renaissance. President Donald Trump is delivering economic turmoil. 
The US stock market, once the only measure of economic performance that the president cared about, has seen a significant selloff amid fears of an impending recession ‚Äî and the US is underperforming relative to its global peers.
Other indicators look brighter, but there are troubling signs on the horizon. February‚Äôs jobs report said the labor market was holding steady, but the report did not yet capture the full extent of Trump‚Äôs mass layoffs of federal workers. Inflation came down slightly in February, but price stability is in trouble as Trump‚Äôs tariffs touch off a global trade war.
Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said the administration is focused on the ‚Äúreal economy,‚Äù tracking Treasury yields as an indicator of its health. Declining Treasury yields could help bring down borrowing costs across the economy, spurring investment and leading to economic growth. But amid the chaos created by Trump‚Äôs policies, it‚Äôs not clear that strategy will work.
The future looks rocky enough that Trump last weekend refused to rule out a recession.
Trump‚Äôs defenders say the pain is temporary and that good times are ahead: ‚ÄúI‚Äôd kind of suggest people keep their powder dry and pay attention to a well-thought-out economic plan that will indeed make America great again,‚Äù Larry Kudlow, a Fox Business pundit and former Trump adviser, said Monday.
But the American public remains skeptical: A March Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 57 percent of Americans think Trump‚Äôs economic policy has been too erratic. Other recent polls similarly show his approval ratings on his handling of the economy tanking. 
Here‚Äôs what the economy looks like right now, in four charts.
Investors might have hoped that Trump‚Äôs second term would be a boon for the stock market. Trump certainly gave the markets a lot of attention during his first term, when he frequently touted the record highs the stock market reached under his tenure, appearing to view it as a direct reflection of the strength of his economic policies.
In his second term, the markets have instead been roiled by his tariff policies, which threaten to raise prices for Americans and have set off a trade war, Meanwhile, he has dismissed concerns about a potential recession. 
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see it at all,‚Äù Trump told reporters on Tuesday when asked if he thinks there will be a recession.
Major US stock indices closed higher on Wednesday following the inflation report. But they are still posting losses this year to date. That has put them behind global stock indices. Some of those that exclude US stocks have even posted gains so far in 2025. 
Though hiring has remained strong, there are some signs that the labor market is cooling down. The US added 151,000 jobs in February, but the unemployment rate increased to 4.1 percent from 4 percent. 
That uptick might be a sign of a slowdown to come. In February, US employers announced job cuts on par with what was seen during the last two US recessions.
The February jobs numbers also do not fully reflect the impact of cuts underway at the federal government.
On Wednesday alone, the Trump administration slashed more than 1,300 jobs at the Education Department, practically halving its size. Elon Musk‚Äôs Department of Government Efficiency has also claimed to have made over $100 billion in spending cuts, but his team has been unreliable in their accounting. Those cuts could also affect jobs at businesses that contract with the federal government.
Trump officials have signaled that they‚Äôre closely monitoring a benchmark known as the 10-year Treasury bond yield.
That yield is the interest rate that the federal government pays to Treasury bondholders each year on loans that mature after 10 years. It affects borrowing costs for everything from the $12.6 trillion mortgage market to $5.8 trillion in bank lending. The current yield is about 4.2 percent.
That rate isn‚Äôt determined by the government but rather set by market forces. If financial institutions are feeling good about the US‚Äôs financial outlook, their bids at these bond auctions may be lower. If they‚Äôre predicting economic turbulence, as is currently the case, those bids may be higher.
In the immediate aftermath of Trump‚Äôs reelection, the 10-year Treasury rate rose sharply. It‚Äôs come down since peaking in January, but rose again amid the uncertainty and fear created by Trump‚Äôs tariffs.
Bessent has said that lowering the Treasury yield could bring financial relief to struggling Americans, and Trump heralded a ‚Äúbig, beautiful drop‚Äù in Treasury yields during his recent address to Congress.
However, there are some snags in his plans: For one, Germany has triggered a global bond selloff with its recent announcement of major infrastructure and defense spending, causing US Treasury yields to rise. And Trump‚Äôs tariffs may actually lead to more inflation, making it difficult for borrowing costs to come down. 
New data from the federal government published Wednesday shows that inflation cooled to 2.6 percent in February, exceeding some analysts‚Äô expectations. But it might be premature to celebrate. 
That‚Äôs because Trump‚Äôs tariffs may have not yet been fully priced into consumer goods. Trump imposed 25 percent tariffs on all aluminum and steel goods on Wednesday, and the European Union and Canada have responded with retaliatory tariffs on a host of US products ranging from bourbon to motorcycles.
Trump has also imposed a 20 percent tariff on Chinese goods and 25 percent tariffs on imports from Canada and New Mexico, though has exempted broad categories of goods including goods imported by US automakers. 
If inflation ticks back up again, the concern is that the Federal Reserve might not be able to use the lever of interest rates to respond to a potential recession. The Fed has come closer to its target rate of 2 percent inflation, but might not be willing to introduce further interest rate cuts if that number starts rising again.

30,2025-03-13,"The Apple Intelligence features that Apple introduced with iOS 18 are not pushing people to upgrade their iPhones, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reiterated today. Apple's recent Siri failures are also going to have an impact on 2025 iPhone shipments, which the market is beginning to realize.
As early as last July, Kuo said expectations that ‚ÄåApple Intelligence‚Äå could drive ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå upgrades were likely ""too optimistic,"" and in January, he was even more explicit and said that the appeal of ‚ÄåApple Intelligence‚Äå had ""significantly declined"" because of the delay between when Apple showed off ‚ÄåApple Intelligence‚Äå features in June and when they launched starting in October.
Kuo is maintaining his cautious view in light of Apple's Siri debacle, which has seen the company delay heavily advertised ‚ÄåApple Intelligence‚Äå ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå features that it initially said would come in ‚ÄåiOS 18‚Äå.
According to Kuo, Apple is already aware of ‚ÄåApple Intelligence‚Äå's ""underwhelming performance,"" and has provided suppliers with conservative ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå shipment forecasts as a result.

Lately, the market consensus has shifted to a more cautious stance on iPhone shipments and Apple Intelligence (Siri), which supports my earlier predictions. Moreover, it's clear that when Apple shared conservative shipment forecasts with its key suppliers early this year, they had already factored in Apple Intelligence's underwhelming performance.
The negative public sentiment that Apple is facing due to the ‚ÄåApple Intelligence‚Äå ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå delay could further impact sales of the iPhone 16 and iPhone 17 models in the coming months. Apple last week said that ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå personal context and App Intents are being pushed back until the ""coming year,"" and it doesn't seem like the company expected such a critical reaction from the tech community and its customers.
Longtime Apple reporter John Gruber, for example, recently published an in-depth report calling out Apple's ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå shortcomings, and his commentary has resonated with many who have the same feelings about Apple's longtime struggle with ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå improvements.
Many others have also spoken up on the very public demonstrations of ‚ÄåApple Intelligence‚Äå ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå features that Apple provided over the course of the last year and the subsequent delay that has shaken public confidence in the company's ability to deliver AI features that can compete with OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and others.

32,2025-03-13,"Meta has won an emergency ruling in the US to temporarily stop a former director of Facebook from promoting or further distributing copies of her memoir.
The book, Careless People by Sarah Wynn-Williams, who used to be the company's global public policy director, includes a series of critical claims about what she witnessed during her seven years working at Facebook.
Facebook's parent company, Meta, says the ruling - which orders her to stop promotions ""to the extent within her control"" - affirms that ""the false and defamatory book should never have been published"".
The UK publisher Macmillan says it is ""committed to upholding freedom of speech"" and Ms Wynn-Williams' ""right to tell her story"".
It told the BBC that she had been due to do ""extensive media"" in the UK and internationally and ""has been prevented from doing so"".
At a hearing on Wednesday at the American Arbitration Association - a neutral third party which resolves disputes out of court - Ms Wynn-Williams was told she must refrain from engaging in or ""amplifying any further disparaging, crucial or otherwise detrimental comments"".
All previous disparaging comments ""to the extent within her control"" must also be retracted, the ruling also said.
The book is former New Zealand diplomat Ms Wynn-Williams' account of joining Facebook in 2011 and watching it grow from a ""front row seat"".
Her allegations include that executives had worked ""hand in glove"" with the Chinese government on potential ways of allowing Beijing to censor and control content in exchange for access to the lucrative market.
Meta disputes the allegations contained in the book. Regarding China, it says it is ""no secret we were once interested"" in operating services there. ""We ultimately opted not to go through with the ideas we'd explored.""
Ms Wynn-Williams has also filed a whistleblower complaint with the US markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), alleging Meta misled investors - which Meta also denies. The BBC has reviewed the complaint.
During the emergency hearing the arbitrator, Nicholas Gowen, found Meta had provided enough evidence that Ms Wynn-Williams had potentially violated her severance contract. She did not personally attend Thursday's hearing.
In his ruling, Mr Gowan said Meta would suffer ""immediate and irreparable loss"" in the absence of a temporary ruling in the case.
He did not order the book's publisher, Flatiron Books, or its parent company, Macmillan, to take any action.
The ruling will remain in effect unless it is modified or lifted following a full hearing.
Following the decision, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said in a post on X: ""This ruling affirms that Sarah Wynn-Williams' false and defamatory book should never have been published.""
Careless People was released in the US, where it is number six on the Amazon chart, on Tuesday. It was published in the UK on Thursday.
In a statement, a spokeswoman for Macmillan said: ""As publishers, we are committed to upholding freedom of speech and her right to tell her story. Due to legal process instituted by Meta, the author has been prevented from continuing to participate in the book's publicity.""

The delays Apple Intelligence has faced might impact iPhone sales negatively.
Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo called the performance of Apple Intelligence ""underwhelming,"" adding that it won't entice people to replace their older iPhones. In a social media post on Thursday, Kuo reiterated his previous claims that Apple Intelligence would ""contribute less than expected to shipment volumes."" In October 2024, the analyst said more or less the same thing ‚Äî  that Apple's AI features would not facilitate a short-term boost in iPhone sales.According to Kuo, the market has recently adopted a more cautious view of Apple Intelligence, presumably because of the debacle Apple faced with its planned Siri upgrades. We can already see signs of this, as Morgan Stanley decreased their expectations for Apple's stock prices, citing concerns regarding the current status of Siri and its postponed Apple Intelligence overhaul.The iPhone maker was forced to delay some of Siri's heavily promoted Apple Intelligence features, such as the virtual assistant's personal context functionality and in-app actions.Since last year's WWDC, I've consistently held a cautious view of how much Apple Intelligence would boost iPhone shipments. Take a recent case (see link below), just two months ago, I argued that the market was too bullish on 2025 iPhone shipments and reiterated that Apple https://t.co/pntSCTS4f7‚Äî    (Ming-Chi Kuo) (@mingchikuo) March 13, 2025Kuo claims that Apple ""had already factored in"" the ""underwhelming performance"" of Apple Intelligence when the company shared conservative iPhone sales forecasts with suppliers in early 2025. Apple was presumably aware of the negative impact its Siri delay would have on sales figures.While Apple Intelligence itself was originally announced in June of 2024, at WWDC, the company's generative AI features only made a partial debut with the release of iOS 18.1 in October 2024. Apple ran multiple advertisements depicting a new and improved, contextually aware Siri, but these features still have yet to reach end users, undoubtedly causing frustration and negative sentiment.In January 2025, Apple CEO Tim Cook chimed in on the matter. He said that the iPhone 16 had performed better in regions and markets where Apple Intelligence was available, indicating that the company's generative AI features were a significant factor for users looking to upgrade. This was before Siri's personal context features and App Intents features were postponed, however, making it unlikely that Apple Intelligence will influence iPhone sales in a similarly positive manner going forward. Siri's personal context capabilities are set to arrive ""in the coming year,"" meaning that they might only become available with iOS 19.Apple is said to be working on a massive user interface redesign as part of iOS 19, possibly in an attempt to drive attention away from the slow rollout of Apple Intelligence features. Similarly, a significant design overhaul is planned for the iPhone 17 range, which is set to feature an entirely new ""iPhone 17 Air"" model with an ultra-thin chassis.Ultimately, any poor performance and negative public perception of Apple Intelligence if it materializes in the larger market will likely have a more significant impact on the existing iPhone 16 range, as Apple appears to be working on additional selling points for the iPhone 17. The company might opt to relegate artificial intelligence to the backdrop, putting the spotlight on major design changes and new camera-related features.

I doubt it. Apple Intelligence is a feature in development, not a selling point. People will continue to buy iPhones for the reasons they bought the last one they bought.That said, regardless of your ‚Äúfeelings‚Äù about Apple Intelligence one way or another, I can assure that nearly EVERY person with access to the writing tools should make more use of at least that aspect of AI.For me, the Genmoji/Image Generator will be the part I use the least, but see that‚Äôs the great thing about Apple Intelligence ‚Äî you can use what proves useful to you, and ignore what isn‚Äôt useful to you. Gosh, it‚Äôs almost like they designed it to work like that.

By now it's clear that Apple Intelligence (and other AI) isn't really driving smartphone hardware sales. There was no big pop in sales when the Apple Intelligence capable iPhone 16 family debuted. So a slow rollout of Apple Intelligence features likely won't impact iPhone sales greatly.At least in early 2025 consumer-facing artificial intelligence (in general, not just Apple's offering) is still essentially alpha software. Even Apple labels Apple Intelligence with a ""Beta"" badge but it's barely that (look at the news headlines summary debacle).Clearly you don't need Apple Intelligence for AI assisted writing tools, the third party AI offerings are perfectly capable of that.It's worth noting that Mac sales aren't really affected by Apple Intelligence either; the macOS implementation trails the iOS implementation.Here are the things that consumers prioritize in smartphones: cameras, display, battery life, and price. It's not rocket science. Not peak download speeds on mmWave 5G networks. Not how many polygons it can paint on the screen, not how many TFlops of calculations, not Geekbench scores.I still believe that AI has great potential in the enterprise market and I know it has been used by some very large corporations over several years now. But a context-aware AI chatbot assistant is still years away based on my experiences with 7-8 chatbots. Those tools have way too many mistakes to make them trustworthy so the user ends up spending a lot more time double or triple checking their output. These chatbots aren't trustworthy. They will make up falsehoods and pass them off as fact without any sense of remorse or hesitation.One piss poor tendency that AI designers have programmed into models is the inability for an AI assistant to understand when a question is beyond its capabilities. Trust is earned and a lot of LLM-powered AI chatbot assistants squander some of that trust every time they hallucinate or shovel out some B.S. as an answer.Sure, the engineers say ""we can fix that"" but what they can't fix is the loss of trust. Some of them are belatedly understanding this and now adding more and more boilerplate to answers saying ""okay, we might be wrong so please double check the answer."" That's right, consumers are being asked to do debugging for piss poor LLMs. But for some of us, it's already too late. That trust ship sailed months ago.I think a handful of Apple executives are realizing this. Half-assed AI will ultimately be more damaging than a delayed version of something actually useful and trustworthy.My guess is within five years, 75% of these AI companies will have disappeared from the landscape. Some of the technology will likely be absorbed by some of the giants for internal use on proprietary tasks. But a large number of these consumer-facing AI services will be laughable memories.And in five years a lot of AI engineers will be changing careers because they won't get hired by another company. AI will be writing most of the code. The people who get AI right won't want to hire the people who got it wrong. This is a critical time for Apple. They have to figure out if the right person is driving the stagecoach right now. They can't afford to keep passing the reins over to someone else or it'll end up like Project Titan (Apple Car).

This is what happens when a supply chain god starts listening to marketing and not the engineers.The engineers should have been allowed to come up with at the very least a decent beta before this was announced.

 Protect your retirement lifestyle against stock market volatility.
If you‚Äôre retired, what should you do about recent gyrations in the stock market? During 2024, the S&P 500 gained 25% when you include the return from dividends. In 2025, however, it‚Äôs fluctuated significantly due to concerns about a possible recession caused by pending tariffs and layoffs. Depending on which day you checked, the return on the S&P 500 could have been down 5% or more.
Adding to investors‚Äô anxiety are the predictions that the stock market is currently overvalued and is headed for a significant decline in the near future.
Let‚Äôs look at a historical perspective on stock market returns that can help retirees evaluate their investments. Then let‚Äôs examine three possible responses retirees may want to take.
Figure 1 in the chart below shows the annual return in the S&P 500 since 1926, including the return from dividends. This chart provides a visual of the following conclusion: Most of the time, but not always, you‚Äôll earn more money by remaining invested in the stock market.
 
The numbers confirm the stock market ‚Äúdouble-double‚Äù advantage:
The chart also shows that if you‚Äôre invested in the stock market during your retirement, you should be prepared for some years of negative returns‚Äîit‚Äôs inevitably going to happen. Historically, however, if you were patient and stayed invested, the market eventually bounced back and you most likely would have experienced a net gain. This observation might be most relevant for retirees in their 50s, 60s, or early 70s who could be retired for 20 years or more and have the time to be patient.
It‚Äôs important to remember that most people‚Äîprofessionals and amateurs alike‚Äîdon‚Äôt have a reliable crystal ball that warns them when the stock market will drop or alerts them when the market is about to take off. This means you‚Äôll need to develop strategies to protect your retirement income and lifestyle without knowing when the market might crash.
With these observations in mind, let‚Äôs look at three possible strategies you might consider for your retirement investments.
With this perspective, you wouldn‚Äôt make significant changes to your asset allocation for investments that generate retirement cashflow, since you‚Äôve developed a careful strategy to ride out downturns. Here are two strategies that serve this purpose, supported by research I‚Äôve conducted at the Stanford Center on Longevity:
You can implement this second strategy by using a dynamic withdrawal method to determine the annual amount of your withdrawals. Such a method automatically reduces your withdrawals during downturns and limits withdrawals during upturns. The IRS required minimum distribution is one example of a dynamic withdrawal method that research shows has worked well in the past.
This strategy might be most appropriate for retirees in their mid 70s or older who have a more limited investing horizon or for retirees who are very conservative with their investments.
With this strategy, you decide that while you‚Äôve had a good ride in the stock market, the ride is over. The S&P 500 has had positive returns in 14 of the 16 years since the 2008 financial crisis, with the one significant loss in 2022 attributable to the pandemic. You could decide that you‚Äôve enjoyed cumulative returns far higher than what you expected when you retired. Even if you lost 5% in 2025, you‚Äôre still way ahead given your gains in 2024 and earlier.
So, it could be time to declare victory and secure your gains. In this case, you‚Äôd shift a significant amount of your stock market investments to cash, bonds, or income annuities.
Keep in mind that if you sell stock investments with significant gains, you could incur capital gains taxes on investments that are not invested in tax-advantaged retirement accounts, such as IRAs, 401k, 403b, or 457 accounts.
This strategy is a hybrid of the two strategies described above. With this approach, you‚Äôd make modest changes to your asset allocation, such as rebalancing your money between stocks and bonds towards a specified goal. It could also include converting some of your invested assets to a low-cost income annuity or bond ladder, while still maintaining some stock market investments. Finally, it could include building cash reserves to help ride out future downturns.
The best investment strategy for you would generate sufficient cashflow to support the life you want, while helping you sleep at night without money worries interrupting your dreams. No matter where you are in your retirement journey, it‚Äôs worth your time to periodically review your investment and retirement income strategies with these goals in mind."

For Quantum Computing, Pressing the Advantage Is a Risky Proposition
D-Wave‚Äôs fresh claim that it has achieved ‚Äúquantum advantage‚Äù has sparked criticism of the company‚Äîand of the scientific process itself
By Lee Billings edited by Dean Visser
Alengo/Getty Images
D-Wave, a Palo Alto, Calif.‚Äìbased technology firm, made a scientific and stock-market splash on Wednesday with its declaration of a breakthrough in quantum computing. But for some experts, the company‚Äôs claims are landing with a thud.
In a paper published in Science, an international team of more than 60 people led by D-Wave scientist Andrew King reported a demonstration of ‚Äúquantum advantage,‚Äù which occurs when a quantum computer solves a problem that would be nigh impossible for a classical computer to handle. Quantum computers derive their number-crunching power from quantum bits, or qubits. Unlike the regular binary bits of classical computers, which use 1‚Äôs and 0‚Äôs, qubits can use values of 0, 1 and any increment in between. Classical computers handle calculations like an assembly line, bit by bit. Quantum computers can use carefully orchestrated arrays of qubits to explore multiple solutions in ways classical computers cannot, exponentially increasing the speed and breadth of some calculations.

Using the company‚Äôs qubit-packed Advantage2 quantum processor, the D-Wave team accurately simulated how certain physical transitions occur within magnetic materials‚Äîa key consideration in manufacturing smartphones and other advanced electronic devices. According to a company press release, the feat shows that the Advantage2 chip ‚Äúperforms magnetic materials simulation in minutes that would take nearly one million years and more than the world‚Äôs annual electricity consumption to solve using a classical supercomputer.‚Äù
D-Wave‚Äôs stock price increased by 10 percent in subsequent same-day trading, and the announcement led to strong stock-price gains for several other quantum-computing companies such as Quantum Computing, IonQ, Arqit Quantum and Rigetti Computing. Such upticks are part of an ongoing surge in quantum stocks, with D-Wave‚Äôs stock price almost tripling over the past year and Rigetti Computing and Quantum Computing seeing share values more than quadruple in that time.
Behind these multibillion-dollar market movements lies another, more troubling trend. Loud declarations of various types of quantum advantage aren‚Äôt new: Google notably made the first such claim in 2019, and IBM made another in 2023, for example. But these announcements and others were ultimately refuted by outside researchers who used clever classical computing techniques to achieve similar performance. In D-Wave‚Äôs case, some of the refutations came even before the Science paper‚Äôs publication, as other teams responded to a preliminary report of the work that appeared on the preprint server arXiv.org in March 2024. One preprint study, submitted to arXiv.org on March 7, demonstrated similar calculations using just two hours of processing time on an ordinary laptop. A second preprint study from a different team, submitted on March 11, showed how a calculation that D-Wave‚Äôs paper purported would require centuries of supercomputing time could be accomplished in just a few days with far less computational resources.
In response, D-Wave‚Äôs King told New Scientist that while such classical feats are ‚Äúa huge advance,‚Äù they were too rushed and incomplete to refute the company‚Äôs claims of quantum advantage. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt do all the problems that we did,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt do all the sizes we did, they didn‚Äôt do all the observables we did, and they didn‚Äôt do all the simulation tests we did.‚Äù
Achieving a genuine and practical quantum advantage has enormous implications, from designing better pharmaceuticals and electronics to overturning the encryption schemes upon which national defense and the global financial system depend. It‚Äôs something so disruptive that it could confer almost incalculable wealth and power to whoever does it first‚Äîso naturally the competition is fierce.
Critics say, however, that this high-stakes struggle is leading to improprieties in the scientific process and an uneven playing field in the peer-reviewed literature. Simply put, even though the science itself may be sound, the market-driven temptation to overhype results is almost irresistible‚Äîwith potentially disastrous results for the health of the field if or when confusing disputes over claims cause financial bubbles from qubit-enamored investors to finally pop. ‚ÄúThis model of using high-profile publications to broadcast scientific work done within a private quantum company is becoming more and more problematic,‚Äù says Giuseppe Carleo, a computational physicist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL), who co-authored the March 11 preprint that challenged D-Wave‚Äôs results with his EPFL student Linda Mauron.
Carleo says that it‚Äôs been a general impression in the quantum-computing community that some major journals encourage bombastic claims from prominent corporate-backed research groups by offering them a friendlier and faster peer-review process. Most media outlets then vigorously cover these supposed breakthroughs but often dedicate slim-to-no coverage to their subsequent invalidation. ‚ÄúThis is possibly even more problematic because it fuels quantum hype,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThese journals do not give the same visibility to the scientific voices who are in disagreement with this way of doing science.‚Äù Of the multiple recent refutations of quantum advantage claims, Carleo adds, ‚Äúnone have landed a publication in Nature or a journal of similar stature.... And it will also be the case this time with the D-Wave experiment.‚Äù (Nature and Scientific American are both part of Springer Nature.)
Even so, Carleo says, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with the results from D-Wave, Google, IBM and others, all of which ‚Äúrepresent potentially good advances in computational physics.‚Äù Rather the problem is the clamor to prematurely declare quantum advantage. ‚ÄúClaims of beating ‚Äòall classical methods‚Äô are very hard to justify scientifically,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúbecause it‚Äôs humanly impossible to run all state-of-the-art classical methods on a given problem to show they‚Äôre truly inadequate compared to some quantum method.‚Äù
Can the cycle of quantum hype be broken? Doing so will take the combined efforts and ethics of scientists, publishers, journalists and investors‚Äîand that‚Äôs a problem that may be even harder than wrangling qubits.
Editor‚Äôs Note (3/14/25): This article was edited after posting to correct the description of where D-Wave is based and to better clarify the description of quantum computers.

Your link doesn't work.
From the sidelines it sure looks like Apple is the only leg of this stool that does not tilt Alphabet's way.
Mozilla's actions over the past 5 to 10 years sure look well aligned to whatever their ad-tech partner would like to see.
You need some better binoculars and actually watching the right game!
DEI is just anti-discrimination. They didn't preemptively cut out part of their potential workforce, you say, so they're about to fail. Bonkers.
Meanwhile, they're spending money on advertising platforms and AI and other things nobody asked for. Things that take away from their core business and cost a lot of money.
>""DEI is just anti-discrimination.""
Well, no.  Primarily because ""DEI"" is based almost completely on immutable characteristics that shouldn't matter (like sex, race, sexual preference, age, religion, etc).  It is not an effort to have diversity or inclusion of *thought*.  It is, in most ways the complete opposite of meritocracy.  If you are recruiting/admitting/rewarding based on immutable characteristics, that is a bad form of discrimination- rewarding people for WHAT they are, rather than WHO they are. 
That's like arguing that you shouldn't hire any Java developers because there are better qualified Rust people applying for the job. The fact that knowledge of Java is what you need is irrelevant because you are hiring based on ""merit"".
Diversity of thought, having a well rounded team, is a strength in itself.
Don't spread the myth of it being about lowering standards either. It's about recognizing that the way you measure merit is often flawed in ways that exclude some people. It's about improving your metri 
>""Diversity of thought [...] is a strength in itself.""
Agreed.  But that has *not* been the implementation, or outcome of ""DEI"".  Often is is not the goal, either.  DEI has been almost completely about race/sex/orientation/etc quotas.  The ""D"" and the ""E"" are just a farce.
If the E was ""equality of opportunity"", that is great and everyone should stand behind that.  But it isn't, it is ""equity"" which means ""equality of OUTCOME"" and that is wrong, unfair, and immoral.
If the D was ""diversity of thought"", that

You have no idea what race or sex I am, or if I have hired people or not.  And it makes no difference (but your statement is wrong).

Giving people a chance is equal opportunity.  That is good, has been around a long time, and not disputed.  It is even the law.  And no, that is NOT what DEI has generally been about.

The Mozilla Foundation scores pretty well overall as a non-profit [charitynavigator.org] (though admittedly they don't get credit for the program expense ratio).

It became too easy for users to forget that building complex software like a modern web browser is a huge, difficult effort, and nothing is really free.

Mozilla should put more resources into Firefox, really turbo-charge it. Concentrate on re-writing substantial parts to simplify the codebase and make it easier to work with. People will piss and moan but it needs to happen. Then all the other stuff can be via add-ons and side projects, but making core Firefox really really good should be the priority. On desktop and on mobile.

Building web browsers (or even browser engines) has been a money-losing proposition for nearly thirty years.  Once Microsoft started to bundle IE with Windows, that was effectively the end of independent browser makers being able to directly charge for the browser itself.

The problem is that it is TOO LATE now for any simple correction. All other browsers are now semi-owned/controlled by Google. Yes, Google certainly is an illegal monopoly in many spaces. Yes, Google used their huge power to take over almost the entire browser space. Yes, this is extremely bad and dangerous in so many ways.

proof of this is that the computer always does what you tell it to do."

Evolving into Lone Pine 2.0 following billionaire founder Stephen Mandel Jr.'s retirement in 2019 has been a ""heavy lift,"" according to the Tiger Cub's co-CIO, Kelly Granat.

        Speaking on investor Patrick O'Shaughnessy's podcast in a rare interview, Granat described how the firm, which was founded in 1997, has had to change from how it invests and how it runs its business because the world looks different than it did during former President Bill Clinton's second term.
    

        Lone Pine, which manages $18 billion and is run by Granat and fellow co-CIO David Craver, has had to focus on ""shoring up the organization for a different world,"" she said. The changes have paid off in the last two years when the manager made 20% in 2023 and 36% in 2024 in its long-short fund ‚Äî but it hasn't been painless.
    

        Hedge funds have historically struggled with succession plans; Ray Dalio's Bridgewater churned through executives in different roles before he gave way for Nir Bar Dea, who became the firm's CEO in 2022. Industry insiders gossip over the potential successors of firms like Elliott Management and Millennium as their founders set up for the next generation but also show no signs of slowing down.
    

        For Lone Pine, it was always understood that Mandel would eventually hand over the reins, but the manager has still dealt with¬†outflows, a rough patch of performance, and the departure of Mala Gaonkar, one of the three people Mandel left in charge of the portfolio, in early 2022.
    

        Granat, a former Harvard tennis player who joined Lone Pine in 2007, described the ""resetting"" of the portfolio following 2022 ‚Äî when its long-short fund fell 38% ‚Äî as necessary.
    

        ""We had lost balance in the portfolio,"" she said. Lone Pine focused too much on the high-growth tech names, and, in the low interest rate environment following the pandemic, there was ""a lack of accountability around valuation.""
    

        Now, there's a focus on sectors they had experience in but had ignored, as well as a lower level of market exposure so the firm is more flexible.
    

        ""There are lots of ways to make money in the market, and we just got really narrow in our purview,"" she said.
    

        She's proud the ""breadth"" of the portfolio is driving returns now ‚Äî the manager made 20% in 2023 and 36% in 2024 in its long-short fund ‚Äî not just a few stocks. Granat pointed out the firm didn't own Nvidia last year, for example.
    

        The portfolio's lower exposure level is partly to respond to structural market changes, such as the growth of passive and pod investing. Granat says the tweak helps them take advantage of times when stocks move for ""non-fundamental reasons,"" such as platforms unwinding positions or a change in which stocks are in indexes.
    

        The firm's changes are not limited solely to its investment staff. For the first time, Lone Pine is dedicating resources toward its public appearance and outreach, she said.
    

        ""We wouldn't do things like this five or 10 years ago,"" Granat said about speaking on a podcast. But ""the world's changed,"" and keeping their heads down and performing is no longer enough, even though the firm still enjoys a solid investor base of long-term investors like endowments and foundations, many of which have been with Lone Pine since inception.
    

        The firm brought on its first-ever business development leader, Pat Cronin, in 2022, and has attended events like iConnections to connect with potential LPs, for example.
    

        ""The onus is on us to tell our story,"" she said. ""There are other things we need to be doing to continue to develop and grow our business.""
    

        But if one thing has stayed the same at Lone Pine, Granat said, it's been the focus on the next generation. Mandel ""was focused at the beginning on the firm outliving him,"" she said, and she and Craver, who are both in their 50s, are continuing the tradition.
    

        ""If I'm in this seat in 10 years, that's probably not the best outcome for our LPs,"" she said.

42,2025-03-13,"The move prevented Democrats from forcing GOP to go on the record on tariffs.
In a sneaky legislative maneuver tied into the effort to pass a funding bill and avert a government shutdown, House Republicans earlier this week successfully blocked Democrats from forcing votes and debate on President Donald Trump's controversial tariffs.
It was a somewhat complicated move. But it worked -- and demonstrated that Republicans are attempting to give cover to Trump and his implementation of sweeping tariffs on top U.S. trading partners that have roiled the stock market and stoked diplomatic tensions.
Had Democrats forced a vote and debate on the tariffs, it could have forced Republicans to go on the record on Trump's tariff agenda -- perhaps splitting with the president's actions.
To tee up Speaker Mike Johnson's temporary government funding bill, which the House passed Tuesday evening, the House first needed to pass what's known as ""a rule."" Buried inside the text of that rule was legislative language that prevents Democrats from forcing a potentially politically painful vote to end Trump's tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China.
How could Democrats compel a vote to end the tariffs?
Trump imposed tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China by declaring illegal migration and fentanyl constituted a national emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the National Emergencies Act.
But, here's the catch: under the NEA, Congress has the authority to move quickly to terminate that emergency declaration. Top House Democrats tried to do that last week.
But inside that rule, which passed along party lines and cleared the way for a vote on the House GOP's stopgap funding bill, was a provision prohibiting lawmakers from forcing a vote to terminate the president's border emergency and the resulting tariffs until at least January 2026.
The section reads, ""Each day for the remainder of the first session of the 119th Congress shall not constitute a calendar day for purposes of section 202 of the National Emergencies Act with respect to a joint resolution terminating a national emergency declared by the President on February 1, 2025.""
Democrats are blasting the move.
""Guess what they tucked into this rule, hoping nobody would notice? They slipped in a little clause letting them escape ever having to debate or vote on Trump's tariffs. Isn't that clever?"" Rep. Jim McGovern, the ranking member on the House Rules Committee, said during floor debate Tuesday.
Congress could still approve a joint resolution to terminate the president's national emergency. That would require the support of both rank-and-file GOP lawmakers and House Republican leadership, which is unlikely.
Democratic Rep. Don Beyer blasted the maneuver on ""ABC News Live Prime with Linsey Davis"" Tuesday.
Asked about the Republicans' move and if Democrats have any way around it, Beyer said ""not really,"" calling it ""tragic.""
""Once again, Trump has ignored existing law and the Constitution with all the tariffs he's been announcing in recent weeks,"" Beyer said. ""He inherited on Jan. 20 the strongest economy this country has ever had. And we are rapidly heading towards recession right now just because of the extraordinary uncertainty in business decisions and capital investment and hiring decisions.""

In an escalation of the ongoing trade war with Europe, President Trump is now threatening a 200% tariff on European alcohol in response to the European Union's retaliation against U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs.
The 25% tariff on aluminum and steel went into effect on Wednesday ‚Äî a move that the EU calls ""unjustified."" In response, the EU announced tariffs on ‚Ç¨26 billion ($28 billion) worth of U.S. goods, including agricultural products and bourbon.
Posting on his Truth Social account, Trump called the EU ""the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the World."" 
He added that if the bloc doesn't walk back a planned 50% tariff on whisky, then ""the U.S. will shortly place a 200% Tariff on all WINES, CHAMPAGNES, & ALCOHOLIC PRODUCTS COMING OUT OF FRANCE AND OTHER E.U. REPRESENTED COUNTRIES. This will be great for the Wine and Champagne businesses in the U.S.""
The global alcohol market has faced a challenging past few years, but was expecting a 2025 that promised ""moderate recovery,"" according to IWSR, a global drinks data and insight provider. But that was before the threatened tariffs. 
Chris Swonger, president and CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States,  urged Trump to reach an agreement with the EU that avoids any further tariffs and harm to the U.S. spirits industry.
""The U.S.-EU spirits sector is the model for fair and reciprocal trade, having zero-for-zero tariffs since 1997,"" Swonger said in a statement to NPR. ""The U.S. spirits sector supports more than $200 billion in economic activity, 1.7 million jobs across production, distribution, hospitality and retail, and the purchase of 2.8 billion pounds of grains from American farmers."" 
""We urge President Trump to secure a spirits agreement with the EU to get us back to zero-for-zero tariffs, which benefits the hospitality industry and U.S. craft distillers who export their products,"" he added. ""We want toasts not tariffs.""

The S&P 500 fell 1.4% on Thursday, marking its lowest point of the year and sliding into a market correction, as it is now down 10.1% from the all-time high it reached less than a month ago.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average also hit a year-to-date low, closing down 537 points.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid nearly 2%, marking its lowest point so far this year.
The losses continue a larger market selloff that began last week, bringing the Dow and S&P 500 to their lowest intraday prices since September.
The slump follows Trump‚Äôs 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports that took effect Wednesday, which were met with tens of billions of dollars‚Äô worth of retaliatory tariffs from the European Union and Canada.
In response to retaliatory trading measures from the U.S. allies, Trump ratcheted up threats for more counter-tariffs against the EU and Canada, threatening Thursday to introduce a 200% tariff on wines, champagne and other alcohol products imported to the U.S. from European Union countries.

What is particularly notable about the S&P 500‚Äôs correction is that it comes less than a month after its all-time high of 6,144.15 in February. Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, said in a note the S&P 500 usually experiences three setbacks between 5% and 10% every year on average.
Trump‚Äôs 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports took effect Wednesday morning. Canada then announced its own trade duties on roughly $21 billion worth of American goods, including levies on about $8.8 billion of steel products and $2.1 billion of aluminum goods. The longtime U.S. ally also briefly imposed a 25% surcharge on electricity from Ontario going to about 1.5 million homes and businesses in the U.S and later suspended the charges after Trump threatened to increase steel and aluminum tariffs to 50%. The European Union plans to impose retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. in April. China has also levied its own retaliatory tariffs, imposing 15% trade duties on U.S. chicken, wheat, corn and cotton and 10% tariffs on other agricultural products after Trump enacted a 10% tariff on Chinese products.

President Donald Trump had promised to rev up the economy by imposing tariffs on foreign goods and materials.

        Instead, the duties are heaping new costs on commercial real estate development projects in the US as prices have risen sharply for core building components like steel, aluminum, copper, and tiling.
    

        Joseph Taylor, the CEO of Matrix Development, a New Jersey-based warehouse developer, said that his company has run into a consequence of the tariffs: a jump in the cost of the steel it's buying to erect a warehouse in Newark, New Jersey.
    

        ""I can tell you steel is up 8 to 10%"" for the project, Taylor said, adding that the increases had driven up the planned building's costs by about $2 million.
    

        Another developer planning to build a more than $100 million warehouse outside Washington, DC, said that Nucor, a North Carolina-based steel manufacturer he'd tapped to make the structural beams for the project, alerted him in recent days that the cost of his $12 million order could rise by 15%.
    

        The developer was able to lock in his original price because he'd already ordered the steel, but he anticipated the project's construction costs could rise by about 10% overall because of the effect of tariffs on other materials, such as steel rebar for the project's concrete foundation, and rising prices for insulation and roofing.
    

        The developer said that the increases would eat into his forecast returns for the development.
    

        ""It's going to be harder to get new projects going,"" the developer said.
    

        The person did not want to be identified because he said he is negotiating with other suppliers and doesn't want to tip his hand on where he anticipates price increases.
    

        The prices of commodity goods, such as metal and common fabricated products like rebar and steel wall framing that are used in real estate development, are affected by global markets, industry experts say. The tariffs have pushed up costs, even for goods made domestically.
    

        ""What you did is you hamper competition, so the domestic people simply just raised their price where they can,"" said Dain Drake, a principal at DeSimone Consulting Engineering, whose focus includes sourcing structural steel for commercial development.
    

        The Trump administration in February announced a 25% duty on foreign-made steel and aluminum imports, which went into effect on March 12. Trump has explored tariffs on other important building materials, including copper, which is widely used in plumbing and electrical systems.
    

        The increases haven't been reflected yet in data that tracks materials costs, but many in the industry say builders are beginning to experience sticker shock.
    

        Drake said that quotes for fabricated steel he's helping to procure for the expansion of a manufacturing plant in the Houston area have risen by 20% recently ‚Äî in line with steel increases he has seen across the market. The contractor, which will have to pass the cost onto the customer, was surprised and ""not happy,"" he said, when he reported the new quote.
    

        Drake said that such escalations could affect whether projects proceed.
    

        ""It hasn't shut things down yet, but that conversation's going to manifest,"" he said.
    

        The effects of the tariffs have been felt not just in ground-up development but also in the multibillion-dollar industry for interior work and renovations.
    

        Richard Jantz, an executive at Cushman & Wakefield who leads its project and development services team in the tristate region, said that a large office tenant recently paused a roughly $20 million renovation of a space it occupies in Manhattan because of cost increases related to the tariffs.
    

        The duties have cascaded through the supply chain, Jantz said, raising the price of items like ceiling and acoustic tiles that often use fiberglass made in China or lighting systems that can have internationally sourced components. The Trump administration has imposed a 20% tariff on imports from China.
    

        Ceiling tile systems often use steel or aluminum grids to suspend them, so those are getting more expensive too, builders say.
    

        Jantz said that construction costs in New York City have been rising by about 3% on average a year for decades. He predicted an increase of around 5% this year.
    

        ""That is largely based on the tariffs and a little bit of reflation that we're seeing,"" Jantz said, referring to domestic manufacturers and suppliers who've opportunistically raised prices because foreign competition has grown more expensive.
    

        The higher costs have also hurt the construction of apartments, as Business Insider reported in February.
    

        Trump's return for a second term in the White House was met with widespread optimism across the commercial real estate industry. But a turbulent month and a half in office has rattled investors.
    

        Trump has upended global alliances by placing tariffs on close US trading partners, including Mexico, Canada, and Europe. As major stock indexes have tumbled as a result of his policies, Trump suggested he was willing to accept a contraction in US growth to meet his objectives, telling Fox News that the country may endure a ""period of transition.""
    

        He's also zigzagged on major policy announcements, which has disoriented executives and raised uncertainty in the business sector. For instance, he announced a 50% tariff on Canadian steel on March 11, only to reverse his decision later the same day.
    

        Construction experts say that those whiplash moves encourage developers to wait on the sidelines in the hope that other tariff decisions will also be pulled back.
    

        ""The lack of clarity on the tariffs and the resulting impact of those tariffs, it's driving uncertainty,"" Joseph Mizzi, the president of Sciame Construction, said. ""If someone has to guess with a lack of certainty, they're typically going to ‚Äî in the contracting world ‚Äî guess in a more conservative way.""
    

        Mizzi said that he and other contracting executives he's talked to are growing concerned about the situation. He said the industry had expected an upswing in construction in 2025 after a few years of diminished activity in the sector brought on in part by higher interest rates.
    

        ""We lay in bed at night thinking about things that might happen,"" Mizzi said. ""So, yeah, it's on our radar for sure.""

49,2025-03-13,"A 91-year-old man says he lost his life savings to rogue traders who came to repair a few loose tiles but ended up replacing the whole roof.
Allan, from Hornsea, East Yorkshire, said he was visited by builders after Storm Darragh last December, believing they would fix some minor damage.
Instead, he claims they put up scaffolding, replaced all of his tiles and gave him a bill for ¬£31,680.
Humberside Police is investigating.
Allan said a passing window cleaner told him he had a loose slate in the days after Storm Darragh swept across East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire.
On Sunday 15 December, builders arrived and started putting up scaffolding. 
Allan said he cannot remember whether he asked them to come, or whether it was a cold call.
""A ladder appeared, three people appeared and started stripping the roof, so I thought well they know what they are doing, and bit by bit all the slates disappeared,"" he said.
""They were put on the back of a wagon, and then they drove away with them and came back and started putting new slabs on the roof, just like that.""
Allan said he was confused by the size of the job the roofers were doing, and that he had not asked for it.
""It was so overwhelming,"" he explained. ""Once it started there wasn't anything I could do about it.""
Allan claimed no price for the work was mentioned, but once it was finished he was presented with a bill for ¬£31,680.
""I think he knew how much money I had because I had a bank statement in there [the next room],"" Allan said.
""It was all the money I had.""
Allan said the roofers told him that if he paid them upfront, he would be able to claim the work on insurance, but when he contacted his insurers NatWest Home Insurance, they said they could not cover the cost for remedial work that they had not signed off in advance.
A spokesperson for NatWest encouraged customers to contact them before agreeing for any repair work to be done, ""so we can advise on their claim and validate any work that needs to be carried out"".
They added that they would be providing Allan with ""ongoing additional support"" after the scam.
The BBC has seen the quote and invoice, both dated 18 December, which Allan paid in full by cheque.
Dr Tim Day, the Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI) lead officer for doorstep crime, scams and consumer vulnerability, said this type of scam represents 95% of his caseload - and often the mental toll on victims is far greater than the financial one.
He said that research by the Home Office in 2003 suggested older victims of rogue trader crime were two-and-a-half times more likely to have died or gone into residential care in the two years following an incident than those who had not been victimised.
""It is, unfortunately, robbing people of their independence and it's no exaggeration to say, quite literally, it's killing people,"" he said.
He added that the market was ""flooded"" with rogue traders like the ones who targeted Allan.
Fraud is the most common crime type in the UK, amounting to around 40% of all crime in England and Wales, according to the government.
Dr Day said the government should bring in a compulsory national licensing scheme to make traders more accountable.
""Currently, you've got a situation where anyone can set themselves up, you don't need any experience, or knowledge, or training, and they don't need to be legitimate in any way.
""The trade that they represent, as is often the case at the moment, can purely be a means by which they perpetrate fraud.""
A spokesperson for the Department for Business and Trade said there was ""no clear evidence that a licensing scheme would improve standards"".
They said the department supports the TrustMark scheme for helping people to find competent traders, and that local authorities would have new powers from April to allow for tougher fines against businesses that rip off customers.
Allan said he had accepted that he had lost his money, but when his family tried to call the roofers to try to get the scaffolding down, they did not respond. 
The scaffolding was left on his property for more than two months before another builder offered to take it away for him.
Allan's close friend, Fred Bree, said the extent to which he had been taken advantage of ""beggars belief"".
""Allan is a very proud and independent man, he doesn't seek help - but he's vulnerable,"" Mr Bree added.

The local Trading Standards team at East Riding of Yorkshire Council said it saw similar scams ""day in day out"". 
The details for the firm on Allan's invoice appear to match up with a company that was dissolved in 2022, according to Companies House.
The BBC has decided not to name the company for Allan's safety.
Humberside Police said it was investigating a number of lines of inquiry.
Det Insp Mark Hawley added: ""Those who choose to defraud and carry out such unscrupulous crimes against elderly and vulnerable people are a disgrace to our society.
""I would always encourage anyone who is suspicious that they, or someone they know, may be a victim of fraud to talk to someone about it. If it seems too good to be true, or you feel under pressure to make a quick decision, then that is a potential red flag that something isn't right.""
Details of support with fraud are available at BBC Action Line.
Organisers of the Hornsea project hope it will catch on elsewhere along the East Yorkshire coast.
The fishing competition is held on the East Yorkshire coast between Bridlington and Spurn Point.
Therapy dog Thunder has been making a difference to seriously ill people.

AXON Stock
 
Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON), best known for its taser and body cams for law enforcement agencies, has had a volatile ride, with its stock falling over 15% in a month, followed by a weakness in broader markets. The S&P500 index is down 8% in a month after the Trump administration‚Äôs tariff confirmation on its trade partners including Mexico, Canada, and China. Also, speaking of tariffs, see Trump‚Äôs Tariff Policy: The Ripple Effect On Alcoa And Metal Stocks.

After its recent fall, AXON stock looks attractive but volatile - making it a tricky pick to buy at its current price of around $560. We believe there is minimal cause for concern with AXON stock, which makes it attractive but highly sensitive to adverse events as its current valuation is extremely high.
  We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of AXON stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Axon Enterprise along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a very strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception.
Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, AXON stock looks very expensive compared to the broader market.
‚Ä¢ Axon Enterprise has a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 20.6 vs. a figure of 3.2 for the S&P 500
  ‚Ä¢ Additionally, the company's price-to-operating income (P/EBIT) ratio is 351.1 compared to 24.3 for S&P 500
  ‚Ä¢ And, it has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 134.2 vs. the benchmark's 24.3
Axon Enterprise's Revenues have grown considerably over recent years.
‚Ä¢ Axon Enterprise has seen its top line grow at an average rate of 30.7% over the last 3 years (vs. increase of 6.3% for S&P 500)
  ‚Ä¢ Its revenues have grown 32.4% from $1.5 Bil to $1.9 Bil in the last 12 months (vs. growth of 5.2% for S&P 500)
  ‚Ä¢ Also, its quarterly revenues grew 31.7% to $544 Mil in the most recent quarter from $413 Mil a year ago (vs. 5.0% improvement for S&P 500)
Axon Enterprise's profit margins are worse than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe.
‚Ä¢ Axon Enterprise's Operating Income over the last four quarters was $114 Mil, which represents a poor Operating Margin of 5.9% (vs. 13.0% for S&P 500)
  ‚Ä¢ Axon Enterprise's Operating Cash Flow (OCF) over this period was $298 Mil, pointing to a moderate OCF-to-Sales Ratio of 15.4% (vs. 15.7% for S&P 500)
Axon Enterprise's balance sheet looks very strong.
‚Ä¢ Axon Enterprise's Debt figure was $721 Mil at the end of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $42 Bil (as of 3/12/2025). This implies a very strong Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 1.8% (vs. 19.0% for S&P 500). [Note: A lower Debt-to-Equity Ratio is desirable]
  ‚Ä¢ Cash (including cash equivalents) makes up $1.2 Bil of the $4.0 Bil in Total Assets for Axon Enterprise. This yields a strong Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 28.9% (vs. 14.8% for S&P 500)
AXON stock has fared worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes.
‚Ä¢ AXON stock fell 44.8% from a high of $152.87 on 3 January 2022 to $84.37 on 11 May 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500
  ‚Ä¢ The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 9 November 2022
  ‚Ä¢ Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $710.01 on 18 February 2025 and currently trades at around $560
‚Ä¢ AXON stock fell 40.8% from a high of $88.90 on 19 February 2020 to $52.61 on 18 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500
  ‚Ä¢ The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 1 June 2020
‚Ä¢ AXON stock fell 85.8% from a high of $18.81 on 9 October 2007 to $2.68 on 20 November 2008, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500
  ‚Ä¢ The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 20 February 2014
In summary, Axon Enterprise's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows:
‚Ä¢ Growth: Extremely Strong
  ‚Ä¢ Profitability: Weak
  ‚Ä¢ Financial Stability: Extremely Strong
  ‚Ä¢ Downturn Resilience: Weak
  ‚Ä¢ Overall: Strong
Hence, despite its extremely high valuation, the stock appears attractive but volatile, which supports our conclusion that AXON is a tricky stock to buy.
Not too happy about the volatile nature of AXON stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Egg prices hit another record high in February, but there's a glimmer of hope ‚Äî wholesale prices are now falling, and egg shortages are easing up.

        This could be welcome news in the lead-up to Easter.
    

        The latest consumer price index, released Wednesday, shows that in February, a dozen Grade A eggs cost an average of nearly $5.90 in US cities, surpassing January's then-record high of $4.95.
    

        A year earlier, in February 2024, the average price was just $3 ‚Äî almost half of the current cost, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics CPI data.
    

        Between December 2024 and January 2025, egg prices in the US saw their biggest spike in 10 years, driving up the cost of grocery shopping.
    

        A widespread outbreak of avian influenza (H5N1 bird flu) is the main culprit. When an outbreak is detected, infected chickens and their entire flock must be culled.
    

        As of February 7, the USDA reported that 116.9 million ""layer"" hens ‚Äîbred for egg production ‚Äî had been removed from the population.
    

        Emily Metz, president of the American Egg Board, said in a statement Wednesday that the avian influenza outbreak is disrupting egg supply.
    

        However, she pointed to some ""good news"" ‚Äî demand for eggs has eased, as it usually does before the Easter buying season, which has helped to bring down wholesale prices.
    

        A USDA report published last week said that wholesale prices for graded loose eggs dropped ""sharply"" and that a respite in bird flu outbreaks had given egg producers a chance to catch up on supply shortages.
    

        Even so, while this could eventually lead to lower prices at the store, this hasn't happened yet.
    

        ""Retail price levels have yet to adjust and remain off-putting to many,"" the USDA report said.
    

        Metz also warned that as the Easter holiday grows nearer, demand for eggs may increase, causing a ""second, temporary increase in prices.""
    

        It's also possible that eggs may just be more expensive from now on.


        ""It seems highly unlikely we'll see a $2 egg market anytime soon,"" Karyn Rispoli, a managing editor for eggs in the Americas at Expana, told Business Insider in January.
    

        The rising cost led to Waffle House adding a 50-cent charge to each egg it sells, and some grocery stores limiting egg purchases.


        And, in Pennsylvania last month, 100,000 eggs were stolen from the back of a distribution trailer.

53,2025-03-13,"Several weight loss drug stocks are sliding today as pharmaceutical companies battle for dominance in the booming GLP-1 market ‚Äî which is projected to hit $105 billion by 2030, according to Morgan Stanley (MS+1.94%) analysts.
GLP-1 drugs, also known as incretin treatments, were made famous by Novo Nordisk‚Äôs (NVO-2.46%) Ozempic. They mimic hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite, fueling unprecedented demand. Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly (LLY+2.04%) currently dominate the space, but rivals are scrambling to carve out their share.
Some companies, like Zealand Pharma and Roche (RHHBY-1.91%), are developing next-generation treatments with stronger weight-loss effects. Others, like Hims & Hers (HIMS+8.07%), betted on more affordable off-brand versions ‚Äî an approach that thrived during shortages of branded medications but now faces stricter regulatory hurdles.
Shares of Zealand Pharma and Roche fell 11% and 2%, respectively, on Thursday morning ‚Äî just a day after popping on news of their collaboration to develop new weight-loss treatments.
Zealand announced a partnership with Roche to co-develop and commercialize its experimental drug petrelintide, including a potential  combination with Roche‚Äôs, CT-388. 
As part of the deal, Zealand will receive $1.65 billion upfront, with the total package potentially reaching $5.3 billion if development and sales milestones are met. Roche will handle commercial manufacturing and supply.
‚ÄúWe now hold a more bullish view on the prospect of petrelintide emerging as an important therapeutic intervention for chronic weight management,‚Äù William Blair analyst Andy T. Hsieh wrote about the deal in a note Wednesday.
Zealand previously reported that patients taking a high dose of petrelintide over 16 weeks lost an average of 8.6% of their body weight. For comparison, Novo Nordisk‚Äôs Wegovy led to an average 15% weight loss over 68 weeks in clinical trials.
Roche, a 127-year-old pharmaceutical giant, made its first major move into the weight-loss drug market in 2024, when it acquired Carmot Therapeutics for $2.7 billion. That deal brought in three obesity drug candidates, including CT-388, which showed promising results in early trials ‚Äî patients lost 18.8% of their body weight on average after 24 weeks.
Hims & Hers, the telehealth company catering to millennials, saw its stock drop nearly 5% Thursday morning.
The company jumped into the GLP-1 market last May, offering compounded semaglutide ‚Äî an off-brand version of Ozempic. The move paid off as Hims & Hers‚Äô total sales surged 69% last year to $1.5 billion.
But now, the regulatory landscape is shifting. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently announced that shortages of popular GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy and Eli Lilly‚Äôs Zepbound are officially over. With branded medications now deemed ‚Äúfully available,‚Äù the agency plans to crack down on compounded versions that closely mimic FDA-approved drugs.
Earlier this week, the FDA clarified its policies, giving companies like Hims & Hers until May 22 to stop selling compounded GLP-1 medications that are essentially identical to commercial versions.
Still, Hims & Hers has other avenues to explore. The company could continue to offer more personalized semaglutide formulations and shift its focus to older generic weight-loss drugs.

PLTR Stock
 
Question: How would you feel if you owned Palantir Technologies stock (NASDAQ: PLTR) and it dropped by 50% or more in the coming months? Although it may sound extreme, such an event has occurred before ‚Äì and it could happen again. This year, Palantir‚Äôs stock has experienced notable volatility. It climbed by over 60% from early January to exceed $120 per share by mid-February, then lost about 38% of that high, now trading at roughly $80 per share. Palantir has benefited from the surging interest in generative AI, Donald Trump‚Äôs re-election as U.S. President, and strong earnings in recent quarters. However, broader markets are undergoing a significant selloff amid growing concerns of a U.S. recession following President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs on key trading partners. Given its elevated valuation, Palantir‚Äôs stock might be particularly prone to a steep correction.
Here‚Äôs the point: In an economic downturn, PLTR stock could incur substantial losses. Data from 2022 shows that PLTR stock lost over 70% of its value in just a few quarters. At present, Palantir‚Äôs stock has already dropped from $120 to $80 in only a few weeks. So, could Palantir stock continue its decline and reach around $40 if a similar situation were to occur? Naturally, individual stocks tend to be more volatile than a diversified portfolio ‚Äì so if you prefer growth with lower volatility than that of a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and delivered returns exceeding 91% since its inception.
Palantir‚Äôs revenue growth faces risks. Approximately 55% of 2024 revenue came from government contracts, which are often unpredictable and uneven, making them less reliable. Moreover, the new Trump Administration has been working to ease geopolitical tensions, including mediating between Ukraine and Russia and addressing the Israel-Palestine conflict. Although these actions benefit global stability, they could reduce demand for Palantir‚Äôs software and services, which typically perform well during periods of geopolitical uncertainty. Palantir‚Äôs long-term growth depends on the commercial market, which it serves through its Foundry platform targeting industries such as manufacturing, retail, and healthcare. Even though U.S. commercial sales increased by 64% in the most recent quarter compared to 45% growth in U.S. government sales, challenges remain. The company‚Äôs ticket sizes are usually large, and implementation is complex and costly, so the product may not scale as efficiently for small and medium-sized firms. This could affect future growth.
Palantir‚Äôs margins could come under pressure. Although margins expanded in recent years ‚Äì rising from about 26% in 2023 to nearly 35% in 2024 ‚Äì this trend might not persist. The company has kept marketing expenses in check thanks to its highly customized products and strong customer loyalty, with engineers working closely with clients to tailor solutions. However, if Palantir adjusts its strategy to appeal to a broader customer base, costs may increase, impacting margins. Additionally, competition from diversified tech giants such as Microsoft, which can cross-sell solutions to existing enterprise customers, poses another risk to Palantir‚Äôs pricing power and profitability.
PLTR stock has experienced a greater impact than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some recent downturns. While investors hope for a soft landing for the U.S. economy, how severe could the situation become if another recession hits? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash illustrates how key stocks performed during and after the last six market crashes.
‚Ä¢ PLTR stock fell 67.6% from a high of $18.53 on 3 January 2022 to $6.00 on 27 December 2022, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500
 ‚Ä¢ The stock fully recovered to its pre-crisis peak by 31 July 2023
 ‚Ä¢ Since then, the stock has risen to a high of $124.62 on 18 February 2025 and currently trades at around $78
That said, stock markets are often short-sighted and tend to project short-term trends into the long run. In Palantir‚Äôs case, markets expect the AI boom to persist, with the company continuing to grow its commercial business and diversifying away from its core government segment. However, significant risks remain.
Palantir Technologies‚Äô Revenues have grown considerably in recent years, increasing at an average rate of 23.0% over the last 3 years (compared to a 6.9% rise for the S&P 500). However, with the stock trading at a lofty 48x consensus FY‚Äô25 revenue and about 140x FY‚Äô25 earnings, Palantir might be more exposed to the broader economic environment. High-multiple growth stocks often suffer during downturns, as slower earnings growth generally leads to significant compression in P/E multiples. Moreover, investors usually shift toward more defensive sectors amid heightened risk aversion.
Given this deceleration in growth and overall economic uncertainty, ask yourself this question: Will you hold your PLTR stock now, or will you panic and sell if it begins to drop to $50, $40, or even lower levels? Holding onto a declining stock is never easy. Trefis collaborates with Empirical Asset Management‚Äîa wealth manager in the Boston area‚Äîwhose asset allocation strategies yielded positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P fell by more than 40%.

55,2025-03-13,"March‚Äôs stock market selloff showed no signs of easing Thursday as major indexes closed at their lowest points of the year, sending the S&P 500 into a correction amid intensifying backlash to President Donald Trump‚Äôs sweeping tariffs, which have resulted in retaliatory measures from Canada, China and the European Union.

The S&P 500 fell 1.4% on Thursday, marking its lowest point of the year and sliding into a market correction, as it is now down 10.1% from the all-time high it reached less than a month ago.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average also hit a year-to-date low, closing down 537 points.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid nearly 2%, marking its lowest point so far this year.
The losses continue a larger market selloff that began last week, bringing the Dow and S&P 500 to their lowest intraday prices since September.
The slump follows Trump‚Äôs 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports that took effect Wednesday, which were met with tens of billions of dollars‚Äô worth of retaliatory tariffs from the European Union and Canada.
In response to retaliatory trading measures from the U.S. allies, Trump ratcheted up threats for more counter-tariffs against the EU and Canada, threatening Thursday to introduce a 200% tariff on wines, champagne and other alcohol products imported to the U.S. from European Union countries.

Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla, which has experienced a rough week of trading, closed down 3% Thursday to $240.68, erasing its gains from Wednesday. The electrical vehicle maker, led by billionaire Trump ally Elon Musk, is down around 40% year-to-date.
A correction is when markets drop 10% or more from peak levels. What is particularly notable about the S&P 500‚Äôs correction is that it comes less than a month after its all-time high of 6,144.15 in February. Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, said in a note the S&P 500 usually experiences three setbacks between 5% and 10% every year on average.
Trump‚Äôs 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports took effect Wednesday morning. Canada then announced its own trade duties on roughly $21 billion worth of American goods, including levies on about $8.8 billion of steel products and $2.1 billion of aluminum goods. The longtime U.S. ally also briefly imposed a 25% surcharge on electricity from Ontario going to about 1.5 million homes and businesses in the U.S and later suspended the charges after Trump threatened to increase steel and aluminum tariffs to 50%. The European Union plans to impose retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. in April. China has also levied its own retaliatory tariffs, imposing 15% trade duties on U.S. chicken, wheat, corn and cotton and 10% tariffs on other agricultural products after Trump enacted a 10% tariff on Chinese products.

NFLX Stock
 
Question: How would you feel if you owned Netflix stock and it dropped 60%, or even 70%, within the next couple of months? It may sound extreme, but it has happened before ‚Äì and it could happen again. Netflix has stayed roughly flat this year after a stellar 2024, during which the stock gained roughly 90%, driven by the company‚Äôs crackdown on password sharing and the expansion of its advertising-supported streaming plan. However, we see several near-term risks for the company due to mounting macroeconomic concerns in the U.S., following President Donald Trump‚Äôs imposition of tariffs on key trading partners and the possibility of lower subscriber additions for Netflix. We believe the stock could decline further to levels below $300 per share. Here‚Äôs why investors should be concerned.
The fact is, during a downturn, NFLX stock could lose a significant portion of its value. Evidence from as recently as 2022 shows that NFLX stock dropped over 70% of its value in just a few quarters. So, is it possible for NFLX‚Äôs roughly $870 stock to fall to below $300 if a repeat of 2022 occurs? Naturally, individual stocks are more volatile than diversified portfolios ‚Äì and in this environment, if you are seeking upside with less volatility than that of a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception.
Netflix‚Äôs subscriber growth could slow in 2025 as key initiatives‚Äîsuch as the password-sharing crackdown and the rollout of ad-supported plans‚Äîhave already been implemented across major markets. These strategies likely accelerated demand from future periods, potentially leading to subdued subscriber additions going forward. The company‚Äôs decision to stop reporting subscriber numbers starting in 2025 might indicate that it expects slower growth. See what to expect from Netflix in 2025. By the end of 2024, Netflix added over 40 million subscribers, bringing its paid subscriber base close to 302 million. This expansion was a major driver behind the company‚Äôs stock price gains.
Growth was driven by measures designed to curb password sharing, which required users either to pay for additional sharing options or to create new accounts. This initiative, now active in over 100 countries, helped Netflix both attract new subscribers and better monetize its existing base. Furthermore, the ad-supported tier‚Äîoffering a more affordable entry point‚Äîhas seen strong adoption, with over half of new subscribers in eligible regions opting for this plan as of the most recent quarter. However, with these growth drivers now largely exhausted, Netflix may face challenges in sustaining its momentum, potentially impacting the stock‚Äôs performance.
Economic uncertainty could also weigh on Netflix, which is highly dependent on consumer spending. Trump‚Äôs aggressive tariff measures‚Äîincluding a 20% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico, along with tighter immigration restrictions‚Äîhave raised concerns that inflation might return. All of this suggests that the U.S. economy could encounter significant difficulties, and even a recession ‚Äì our analysis here on the macro picture. On Monday, during an interview, the President did not rule out the possibility that new tariffs might trigger a recession, causing the Nasdaq index to fall by 4%.
When taking into account the heightened uncertainty from the Trump administration‚Äôs policies, these risks become especially critical. The ongoing Ukraine‚ÄìRussia war and global trade tensions further obscure the economic outlook. Tariffs increase import costs, leading to higher prices, reduced disposable income, and weaker consumer spending. This is clearly negative for Netflix, which relies on discretionary income. It also does not help that Netflix plans have become more expensive, with its premium plan now priced at $25 per month and the standard HD plan recently rising by $2.50 to $18 per month. This could result in subscriber pushback or slower new sign-ups. Meanwhile, Netflix‚Äôs content costs are set to rise as it expands into live sports programming, such as NFL games and WWE wrestling. Additionally, intensified competition might lead to higher churn rates or a slowdown in new sign-ups, ultimately impacting margins. These combined pressures could weigh on both profitability and stock performance in the near term.
During some recent downturns, NFLX stock experienced losses that were slightly less severe than those of the benchmark S&P 500 index. Concerned about the impact of a market crash on NFLX stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Netflix Stock Go In A Market Crash? offers a detailed analysis of how the stock performed during and after previous market crashes.
‚Ä¢ NFLX stock dropped 72.1% from a high of $597.37 on 3 January 2022 to $166.37 on 11 May 2022, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500
 ‚Ä¢ The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 27 February 2024
 ‚Ä¢ Since then, the stock climbed to a high of $1,058 on 17 February 2025 and currently trades at around $890
‚Ä¢ NFLX stock declined by 22.6% from a high of $386.19 on 19 February 2020 to $298.84 on 16 March 2020, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500
 ‚Ä¢ The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 13 April 2020
‚Ä¢ NFLX stock dropped 55.9% from a high of $5.81 on 17 April 2008 to $2.56 on 27 October 2008, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500
 ‚Ä¢ The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 17 March 2009
At its current price of nearly $870 per share, Netflix is trading at approximately 35x consensus 2025 earnings, which seems somewhat expensive in our view. In contrast, the stock was trading at about 20x earnings in mid-2022. Although Netflix‚Äôs recent financial performance has been robust, markets tend to be short-sighted, projecting short-term successes into the long term. In Netflix‚Äôs case, the assumption is likely that the company will continue its strong record of subscriber additions and grow revenues at double-digit rates. However, there is a real possibility that subscriber growth may soon decelerate, as the benefits of the password-sharing crackdown and ad-supported tiers eventually stabilize, while economic uncertainty in the U.S. grows.
Given this potential slowdown in growth and the broader economic uncertainties, ask yourself the question: do you intend to hold on to your Netflix stock now, or will you panic and sell if it begins dropping to $300, $250, or even lower? Holding onto a declining stock is never easy.

Many of the world's wealthiest people have taken heavy blows to their personal fortunes this year as recession fears continue to weigh on stocks. Yet one Wall Street titan has leaped up the rich list, growing his net worth more than anybody else.

Jeff Yass, the cofounder of Susquehanna International Group, has gained an unmatched $17.2 billion in wealth this year as of Wednesday's close, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
    

        In contrast, Elon Musk has had $113 billion wiped off his net worth as Tesla stock has tanked 39% this year. Oracle's Larry Ellison, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Dell Technologies' Michael Dell, Alphabet's Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Nvidia's Jensen Huang, and Microsoft's Steve Ballmer have each had at least $12 billion of their wealth erased too.
    

        Yass' gain this year has boosted his personal fortune from about $47 billion to $63 billion, ranking him 23rd on the wealth index. He's now the richest man in finance after Warren Buffett, the fourth-biggest gainer with a $13.4 billion rise this year.
    

        The wealth surge for Yass, 66, stems from an early investment in ByteDance. He still owns about 7% of the Chinese social media company behind TikTok. ByteDance intends to repurchase employees' shares at a valuation of about $312 billion, up from $268 billion at the end of 2023, Bloomberg recently reported.
    

        Moreover, ByteDance investors SoftBank, Fidelity, and T. Rowe Price have raised their internal valuation estimates to north of $400 billion. The upshot is Yass' reported stake may have jumped in value by roughly 50% in a little over a year.
    

        Susquehanna is also worth almost $50 billion, and Yass owns upward of 51% of the firm, regulatory filings show. Yass didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
    

        Yass is a Republican mega-donor who supported President Donald Trump's campaign. He's benefited from the US leader's decision to extend the deadline for ByteDance to sell TikTok and its US operations over national security concerns.
    

        Trump said last year that banning TikTok would make young Americans ""go crazy,"" and he didn't want Mark Zuckerberg's Meta to sweep in and take its place.
    

        Art Dantchik, who cofounded Susquehanna with Yass and is also a ByteDance director, has seen his wealth jump by $6.5 billion to reach almost $17 billion this year, putting him in 122nd place on the rich list.
    

        Yass, 66, is the son of two accountants and graduated as a math major, he says in a video on Susquehanna's YouTube channel. He moved to Las Vegas and spent about 18 months playing poker before becoming an independent options trader. After realizing how lucrative the sector was, he recruited his poker buddies from college to work at his own firm.
    

        Games remain a core part of Susquehanna's culture, according to its website. Employees can take part in board game nights, complete puzzles dotted around the office, and compete in an annual poker tournament. Managers also use strategy games to teach lessons to new employees.

60,2025-03-13,"Patent details have leaked hinting at a non-invasive way to do this.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here‚Äôs how it works.

It looks like Fitbit is working on a non-invasive way to track people's blood pressure with a future wearable.
The latest patent (patent no. 12,239,424 B2) submitted by the company revealed plans for a wearable being loaded with biometric sensors that could track changes in blood flow and artery stiffness (as first spotted by Gadgets and Wearables).
Generally, blood pressure is monitored using a cuff-like device that tightens to detect the flow of blood and then releases the grip to give the user their readings. To be able to achieve it on a fitness-tracking wearable seems like reaching for the moon.
However, the publication adds that Fitbit goes into the weeds about this possible feature. The patent states that the device will have a mix of pressure sensors and optical sensors embedded within the wearable which could either be a smartwatch or a smart ring. In fact, previous rumors indicate that the company could be working on a smart ring that would be built to track blood pressure, glucose, lipids, hemoglobin, and your diet, along with other fitness metrics.

This leads us to believe that the recent patent could be talking about the smart ring as well. Ideally, the wearable should have either a band or sensors that could track fluctuations in blood flow or artery stiffness.
""The filing describes a system where sensors press against the skin and detect small mechanical changes caused by blood moving through the arteries,"" the publication added. This would have to work in tandem with the usual PPG sensors that smartwatches have that use light to measure blood flow and pressure. The wearable would combine both readings to provide an accurate blood pressure metric.

But how would a wearable such as a smartwatch or ring achieve the tightening of a traditional BP machine, you ask? The patent answers that, too. It says that ""Fitbit‚Äôs wearable could use inflatable or mechanically controlled elements to apply pressure to the skin on a much smaller scale."" This makes it a bit less likely that it could be a smart ring.

Still, this isn't the first time that Fitbit has filed such a patent. In 2023, we saw something similar, where an FDA-approved watch band would turn into an inflatable one to measure blood pressure, as seen below. However, that didn't show up on the subsequent Fitbit watches.
Patents are filed by companies all the time for out-of-the-box features, but that doesn't mean it would show up on the actual device. However, if it does show up on the wearable, it would have an upper hand over other competitors on the market.

61,2025-03-13,"The newest flagship from OnePlus can go on for years before you need an upgrade.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here‚Äôs how it works.

Best answer: The OnePlus 13 will receive four years of major OS updates. Since the phone runs Android 15 (with OxygenOS 15 overlay) out of the box, you can expect it to be updated to Android versions 16 through 19. After the last OS update, the OnePlus 13 will continue to get security patches for two more years.
It probably won't be an exaggeration to say that the OnePlus 13 is the best phone that the company has ever made. Building further upon the foundation laid by its already-excellent predecessor, OnePlus's newest top-of-the-line smartphone manages to get just about everything right. It's no wonder the OnePlus 13 earned a perfect score from Android Central's Nicholas Sutrich when he reviewed the phone.
The OnePlus 13 comes with a refreshed design that's a visual delight. Not just that, the ""2.5D"" curved edges of the front and back panels make it quite comfortable to hold as well. You have a choice of two materials (vegan leather and textured glass) for the rear and both look equally gorgeous. Oh, and you also have an IP69 certification, which is a first for any smartphone. Combined with that premium build quality and top-tier specs (as you'd expect), it's clear that the OnePlus 13 is a smartphone designed to last.
But even though the phone's hardware‚Äîboth on the inside and the outside‚Äîis ready for the long haul, what about the software?

The OnePlus 13 runs Android 15 (with the company's Oxygen OS 15 overlay) out of the box, and OnePlus has committed to providing it four years of major OS updates. This means that it's on track to receive Android 16, 17, 18, and 19 in future. Once that's done, the phone will get security patches for two extra years. It's also worth mentioning that the exact same update policy applies to the OnePlus 13R too.
Now, this software update commitment doesn't sound all that bad, until you realize it doesn't come close to the seven years of major OS updates that Samsung and Google promise for their flagship smartphones. It probably would be alright if this was a mid-range smartphone like the OnePlus Nord 4 (which by the way, also benefits from the same update commitment), but it's not. The OnePlus 13 is a full-blown flagship having a starting price of $900, so we think it deserves more in terms of software support.
What's also worth noting is that the OnePlus 13 is fully capable of going much further as far as updates are concerned, since this thing is crammed with blazing-fast hardware. We're talking about Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, helped by up to 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM and up to 512GB of UFS 4.0 storage. You get a fabulous triple-lens rear camera setup, a 6,000mAh battery with incredible charging speeds, and much more. Sure, OnePlus might think a long software update commitment doesn't make sense, but it actually does, even more so when you're expected to shell out nearly a grand for a flagship.
When all is said and done, the OnePlus 13 is hands down one of the best Android phones you can get in the market at this time. It ticks all the right boxes and is a phone we can recommend to anyone looking for a full-featured flagship. However, a longer update commitment would make the OnePlus 13 an even more astounding value buy than it already is.

62,2025-03-13,"Retroid is making it easier than ever to get into gaming handhelds.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here‚Äôs how it works.

Over the past few weeks, Retroid has been drip-feeding everyone with little bits of information about its upcoming Retroid Pocket Flip 2 and Pocket Classic. With all of the specs and colors revealed, all that was left was price and availability. This morning, Retroid did just that, as it shared how much both of these new gaming handhelds.
As such, the Retroid Pocket Flip 2 is set to retail for either $229 or $189, depending on whether you want the Dimensity 1100 or Snapdragon 865. Meanwhile, the Retroid Pocket Classic will set you back either $119 for the 4GB+64GB model or $129 for 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.

Plus, once pre-orders open on March 17, Retroid is offering a $10 discount on the Flip 2 and $5 on the Classic before jumping up to the retail price once these go on sale. However, Retroid is also offering a ""Combo,"" which saves you $30 and includes both the Snapdragon 865-powered Pocket Flip 2 and the 6GB/128GB Pocket Classic.
Sure, it's only $30, but for that, you're getting two Android gaming handhelds. What makes this special isn't the price; you'll have different form factors to enjoy. So, if you're out and about and want to play some retro games, just stick the Classic in your pocket before you leave. And when you're home, sit back and relax with the larger screen and better ergonomics of the Pocket Flip 2.
While the Pocket Flip 2 and its Snapdragon 865 SoC might seem a bit outdated, it still offers plenty of power for both emulation and other Android games. But there's a good chance that it will have another trick up its sleeve, and that's the ability to emulate Xbox and even PS3 games.

No, you won't find an Xbox emulator on the Play Store or hiding in a GitHub repo. However, after the Retroid Pocket 5 was released late last year, it wasn't long before Linux gaming firmware was made available. Both ROCKNIX and Batocera can be downloaded and installed, making it possible to play Xbox games on your ""Android"" handheld.
That's not even the best part: you don't lose access to Android if you want to try either of these out. The installation steps are fairly tedious, but you're not actually installing the software to the internal storage on the Pocket 5. Instead, you just flash it to a microSD card from your computer.
Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android
Once that's done, pop in the microSD card, hold down one of the volume buttons while restarting, and a few minutes later, you'll have a Linux gaming handheld. And if you want to switch back over to play some Android games, all you have to do is take out the microSD card and restart. Then, you'll be right back into the native Android experience that Retroid provides.

All of this is made possible thanks to the Snapdragon 865, which is exactly the same chip that we're getting in the Retroid Pocket Flip 2. While I assume some tweaks will have to be made to account for the clamshell form factor, there's no reason to believe that we won't get ROCKNIX and Batocera on the Flip 2.
Although much of our focus is more on Android gaming handhelds, those only account for a fraction of the market. There are so many more retro gaming handhelds out there, with the majority of them that make use of Linux-based firmware. But with the Retroid Pocket Flip 2 and the Pocket Classic, you won't have to pick and choose.

As if on steroids, smart locks have been advancing in amazing and surprising ways over the last year, with each few months bringing a new ‚Äúfirst‚Äù to the market. Eufy‚Äôs FamiLock S3 Max offers yet another smart lock innovation that would have been unthinkable just weeks ago: It‚Äôs the first model we‚Äôve seen that has a built-in, 4-inch video screen on its interior escutcheon, relaying video from a camera mounted on the exterior escutcheon, no secondary device required.
It‚Äôs a neat idea but right off the bat, it‚Äôs clearly not a lock that‚Äôs going to make sense for everyone. Like many homeowners, I have a massive window set into the center of my front door, so having a small video screen that displays what is happening on the other side of that door isn‚Äôt going to do me much good. However, those with fully opaque doors‚Äîespecially apartment dwellers ‚Äìmight find this a much more compelling proposition than a peephole.
The Eufy FamiLock S3 Max has a lot going on, and as a result it consumes a huge amount of space. Both interior and exterior escutcheons are enormous, with the exterior measuring 7 x 2.5 inches in size (HxW) and the interior 8 x 3 inches. Both elements are more than 1 inch thick. The full weight of the device is a significant 2 pounds, 11 ounces, although you‚Äôll probably be aware of that only during installation. It carries a weatherization rating of IP65, so according to our IP code decoder, it‚Äôs entirely protected from particulate matter, like dust, and that it can withstand blasts of water from a tightened nozzle (but not a pressure washer). Eufy also obtained an ANSI Grade 1 certification, which our ANSI/BHMA guide tells us is the highest rating for physical security.
No other smart lock packs as many features as the Eufy FamiLock S3 Max: Video doorbell, palm reader, numeric keypad, rechargeable battery, and ANSI Grade 1 certification.
The list of features on the lock goes far beyond its video capabilities, but that‚Äôs where we‚Äôll start. The four-inch display relays video from the front-mounted camera, which captures square-shaped video at a maximum resolution of 1600 x 1600 pixels, with a 180-degree (diagonal) viewing angle. Standard infrared video is built in. Video is stored locally by default on 16GB of non-upgradeable storage. A cloud backup service is available, but it‚Äôs certainly not required unless you‚Äôre concerned about someone stealing the lock itself. The plan runs $3/month or $30/year for one device or $10/month or $100/year for up to 10 devices. Both plans store a copy of all videos online for 30 days. (These prices however are going up on April 1, 2025.)
The unit also functions as a doorbell, courtesy of a large button that becomes ringed in blue light when motion is detected. There‚Äôs no interior chime included with the lock, but you can configure an Amazon Echo device to serve as a chime if you install the appropriate skill. This worked well in my testing.
The massive Eufy FamiLock S3 Max needs two cables to enable all its features.
Christopher Null/Foundry
As far as access goes, the unit has two primary avenues of operation. First, a numeric touch-sensitive keypad supports a maximum of 100 PINs. Second, the unit includes a now trendy palm vein reader, allowing for touchless authentication by simply holding your hand a few inches away from a reader mounted on the top of the exterior escutcheon. The lock can store 50 different palm scans (up to two per user). Lastly, in addition to app-based access, the unit includes a physical keyhole that can be accessed by popping out the doorbell button, although note I found it to be a little difficult to get back into place securely.
The unit is uniquely powered by a rechargeable 15,000mAh battery and four AAA batteries that serve as backups in case the primary cell dies. These are wedged into the interior escutcheon atop the primary cell, which is part of the reason why the interior escutcheon is so large. Eufy says the primary cell should last at least six months, with one additional month of operation provided by the AAA cells in reserve. There is no emergency power port on the exterior escutcheon, so don‚Äôt ignore the notifications of the primary battery‚Äôs state‚Äîat least not for long.
With all of that prologue, we can finally delve into how well all of this works. The short answer, all around, is quite good.
The wide array of settings in the Eufy app reveals the long list of features this smart lock has to offer.
Christopher Null/Foundry
Physical installation isn‚Äôt difficult, but it does take a few small extra steps due to the needs of the video system. As is common, the exterior escutcheon is bolted to an interior frame with two screws, which in turn attaches to the interior escutcheon with an additional four screws. Two electronics cables are needed to connect the two pieces together, although these are easy to properly route and get seated properly. There‚Äôs an additional piece on top of the interior escutcheon that houses the video screen, this snaps on without the need for additional hardware, covering up the battery packs. All of this goes together quickly and cleanly, despite the few extra pieces in the mix.
Setup in the revamped Eufy app (no longer called Eufy Security) involves little more than scanning a QR code on the interior escutcheon. Oddly, this is labeled as a Matter code (more on Matter support later), but it also functions directly with the Eufy app. In my testing, the app connected quickly to the lock and I had it onboarded and connected to my 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network (5GHz networks are not supported) in less than a minute.
Incorporating a palm reader, a video doorbell, a numeric keypad, and a rechargeable battery requires a large form factor.
Christopher Null/Foundry
The Eufy app is a sprawling system that isn‚Äôt particularly difficult to navigate, but it does require a significant amount of time to master because it has so many moving parts. The app is now a do-it-all system with separate tabs for ‚Äúlights,‚Äù ‚Äúsecurity,‚Äù ‚Äúclean,‚Äù and ‚Äúcare,‚Äù and it handles everything from smart locks to robotic mowers to smart scales and breast pumps. You‚Äôll find the FamiLock in the security section, where a widget with the most recent thumbnail from the lock‚Äôs camera can be seen, along with quick access to the lock/unlock icon. Tapping the thumbnail takes you to a larger, live view of the camera, along with quick access to on-demand recording, screenshot, up to 3 ‚Äúquick responses‚Äù that you record with your own voice, and two-way talk. You‚Äôll also get to this screen automatically if someone rings the doorbell and you tap the notification.
Recordings are managed through the Events tab at the bottom of the screen, and they‚Äôre presented as a chronological view of all activity‚Äîdoor lock/unlock actions, motion detections, and doorbell rings‚Äîwith all videos accompanied by a thumbnail. You can set the camera to record on all motion or only when humans are detected (and you can dial the detection range from 3 to 20 feet). The onboard AI does a good job of determining if a human is in the video or not. An activity zone, loitering detection mode, and ‚Äúleaving detection mode‚Äù that notifies you if someone departs are all also available.
Video quality is fine but nothing earth-shaking. The ultra-wide-angle view makes for quite a distorted view, and unless your visitor is less than a few feet away from the door, I found it was virtually impossible to make out their face. Night vision is solid, in part because of multiple lights on the front of the device that illuminate when motion is detected.Clips loaded quickly throughout my testing and could be easily downloaded without trouble.
User management is tied to individuals, and you can configure each person to have 24/7 access, scheduled access (expiring at a set time or based on time/day of week), or one-time access, using a PIN that you set. Only after a PIN is added are you invited to add up to two palm vein scans for the user, though these are optional. I had no trouble using either PINs or palms to gain entry to the lock, although the lock sometimes struggled with palm scans if my hand was presented at an angle instead of vertically.
The camera in the Eufy FamiLock S3 Max suffers from a bit of barrel distortion.
Christopher Null/Foundry
Additional features I haven‚Äôt yet covered include auto-locking (5 seconds to 3 minutes, schedulable) and configurable wrong-try protection that locks down the device for up to 5 minutes after 3 to 10 wrong attempts. A variety of power-management modes are available as well that let you determine when and for how long to record video. (‚ÄúOptimal surveillance‚Äù will record for up to 60 seconds when motion is detected, while ‚ÄúBalance surveillance‚Äù will max out at 20. ‚ÄúOptimal battery life‚Äù won‚Äôt record on motion detection at all.)
As noted previously the device supports Matter and can be onboarded directly to a Matter hub by scanning the same QR code on the interior escutcheon. I was able to add the lock to iOS Home by scanning the code, but soon found there‚Äôs very little point to doing this, as there‚Äôs no support for most of the advanced features of the lock through Matter‚Äîincluding palm vein scanning and any of the video features. If you‚Äôre just looking for a Matter lock that lets you assign PINs, there are many more affordable and simpler options around.
Further reading: This review is part of TechHive‚Äôs in-depth coverage of the best smart locks.
Lastly, at $400, there‚Äôs no way around the fact that the Eufy FamiLock S3 Max is extremely expensive‚Äîmore than the combined cost of a separate video doorbell and quality smart lock. That said, does work very well considering its complexity; as such, it might make sense for those who prefer a single device and who can make good use of the integrated video screen.
If you do have a window in your door‚Äîor sidelights next to it‚Äîyou might want to consider the Eufy FamiLock S3, instead. It has the same features except for the integrated camera and display, and it costs $50 less: $349.99.

65,2025-03-13,"European alcohol stocks are sinking after President Donald Trump threatened to retaliate against a new tariff on American alcohol with his own massive duties. 
The European Union recently hiked its duties on imports of American whiskey to 50%, in a move that the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States called ‚Äúdeeply disappointing.‚Äù Trump fired back with a threat to quadruple the size of Europe‚Äôs new duties. 
‚ÄúIf this Tariff is not removed immediately, the U.S. will shortly place a 200% Tariff on all wines, champagnes, & alcoholic products coming out of France and other E.U. represented countries,‚Äù Trump wrote on his Truth Social, saying that U.S. businesses will benefit.
American depositary receipts (ADR) of French wine and spirits companies Pernod Ricard and Remy Cointreau (REMYY-2.56%) fell by 4% and by more than 3%, respectively. Davide Campari-Milano‚Äôs ADRs fell by more than 3%. 
LVMH (LVMUY-0.13%) (MC+1.80%), which owns Hennessy and other brands, saw its ADRs drop by more than 1%. Dutch brewer Heineken‚Äôs (HEINY-0.46%) traded more than 1% lower.
Shares of Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD-0.68%), the largest brewer in the world and maker of Corona and Budweiser, fell 1% following Trump‚Äôs threat. The company on Thursday also denied a report that it planned to cut thousands of jobs this year.
British firm Diageo (DEO-1.53%), which owns Johnnie Walker and Guinness, traded slightly down. Shares of New York-based Constellation Brands (STZ-0.92%) slightly increased, while Kentucky-based Brown-Forman (BF.B-0.95%), the brand behind Jack Daniel‚Äôs, rose 1%. Boston Beer Co. (SAM-2.20%) shares fell by more than 1%.
A tariff is a tax on an imported good and paid for by the importing business, not the foreign seller. They‚Äôre designed as a protective measure that encourages domestic companies to shift manufacturing back home, while also pushing consumers to buy products made by domestic firms. 
The U.S. imported $1.23 billion worth of distilled spirits from the E.U. in 2024, according to the Department of Agriculture. American whiskey exports to Europe grew to $699 million in 2024, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States. After the E.U. hit whiskey imports with retaliatory tariffs in 2018, exports to the largest market for U.S. whiskey fell 20% over the next three years, the Council said.
‚ÄúYet again, spirit drinks have become collateral damage in an unrelated trade dispute,‚Äù Pauline Bastidon, director of trade and economic affairs at SpiritsEurope, said in a statement Wednesday, ahead of Trump‚Äôs retaliation.
 ‚ÄúThe EU and US spirits sectors stand united in their steadfast commitment to maintaining transatlantic spirits trade tariff-free,‚Äù Bastidon added.

The year is off to a rocky start for Dollar General shoppers ‚Äî and it's not expected to get better, the chain's CEO said Thursday.

        Patrons of the dollar store chain have indicated that ""their financial situation has worsened over the last year as they have been negatively impacted by ongoing inflation,"" CEO Todd Vasos said.
    

        ""Many of our customers report they only have enough money for basic essentials with some noting that they have had to sacrifice even on the necessities,"" he added.
    

        Looking at the rest of 2025, Dollar General is ""not anticipating improvement in the macro environment, particularly for our core customer,"" Vasos said.
    

        Shares of Dollar General were 5% higher on Thursday morning after the chain issued sales guidance for the year that was on the high end of analysts' expectations.
    

        Dollar General is the latest retailer to take a cautious stance on consumer spending for this year. Walmart executives said last month that they were taking a ""measured"" outlook on 2025.
    

        A major reason is the series of tariffs that President Donald Trump has either implemented or threatened on a wide range of goods, from electronics to booze.
    

        Retailers, including Best Buy and Target, said that they expected to raise prices in response to the tariffs.
    

        Vasos said Thursday that Dollar General was ""well-positioned to mitigate the impact in 2025"" of the tariffs so far announced, though he acknowledged that the situation could change.
    

        Even without the effect of tariffs, though, Dollar General's target shopper is struggling, he said.
    

        ""She's always strained, as we always say, because of her economic wellbeing, but I would tell you that she is also resourceful,"" Vasos said of Dollar General's typical customer.
    

        Many of the chain's shoppers are only now just getting their ""sea legs"" when it comes to budgeting for ""the additional inflation that's been very sticky out there,"" he added. Inflation increased less than expected in February, with some items actually declining in price. Price increases for some essentials, such as food, continued rising, though.
    

        Shoppers with higher incomes have also continued to turn to the dollar store chain as they attempt to save money, Vasos said. Discount retailers from Dollar General to Walmart have said over the last few years that more consumers with six-figure incomes started shopping at their stores as inflation rose.
    

        ""Nothing that we've seen so far would show that that trade-down has slowed down,"" Vasos added.
    

        One benefit for Dollar General has been some of its rivals closing stores. The chain added more party supplies to its Popshelf stores, for instance, after reports that Party City was winding down its operations, Vasos said. Dollar General has also taken market share from drugstore chains that are closing stores, he said.
    

        ""I believe that there will be further opportunity,"" Vasos said.

To hit his protein targets, Dr. Rupy Aujla doesn't eat lots of red meat or ultra-processed supplements like shakes and bars.

        Instead, the London-based family doctor with a masters degree in nutrition medicine follows what he calls a ""plant-forward"" or ""plant-focused"" diet. It features plenty of fiber and micronutrients from vegetables, fruit, whole grains, nuts, and seeds, and he eats dairy, meat, and fish occasionally.
    

        Aujla, author of the new recipe book ""Healthy High Protein,"" told Business Insider his diet is about 70 to 75% plant-based.
    

        His favorite recipe from his book? The salmon tikka bowl, which you could also make with chicken or tofu.
    

        ""It's easy, you don't have that cognitive load. You can meal prep it if you want as well,"" he said.
    

        Aujla added: ""That way of eating is just super easy for people to get on board with and batch cook. You've got to have things that you can rely on and constantly come back to.""
    

        He shared three recipes, including the salmon tikka bowl, with BI.

        Aujla said: ""I don't use the word 'meaty' lightly. These tacos are really meaty. The blend of umami in the spices, walnuts, mushrooms, and tempeh in the mixture is phenomenal. And unlike 'meat-like meals', this actually packs a big protein punch that satisfies your body's need for this important macronutrient, rather than just having the texture of meat.
    

        ""A smattering of sharp and fresh ingredients brings this wholesome gut-nourishing meal together. Double up the ingredients to make this family-friendly, it's definitely a crowd-pleaser.""

73,2025-03-13,"Despite daily fluctuations, the trend on 30-year fixed mortgage interest rates has been slowly falling through the first three months of this year. Experts say the falling rate could thaw the largely frozen housing market by enticing buyers off the sidelines.
Freddic Mac wrote in its guidance last week:
 The decline in rates increases prospective homebuyers‚Äô purchasing power and should provide a strong incentive to make a move. Additionally, this decline in rates is already providing some existing homeowners the opportunity to refinance.
According to Freddie Mac (FMCC+7.10%) data, rates on 30-year fixed mortgages peaked at 7.04 percent on January 16 and have been in decline since. They were at 6.63 percent on Thursday, March 13.
 Marty Green, a principal at mortgage law firm Polunsky Beitel Green, says the current downward trend is more seasonal normality than anything.
‚ÄúWe are seeing a more normal spring market unfold as additional inventory and reduced interest rates have increased overall activity,‚Äù Green says, adding that so far the mortgage market moves and increased inventory seem to be constructive regarding a housing recovery.
‚ÄúHowever, it is still too early to tell whether this recovery will have legs. If rates continue their latest downward trend, one could certainly envision an environment for activity in the housing sector to accelerate fairly deep into 2025,‚Äù Green says.
Too much economic uncertainty breeds housing uncertainty, bringing a mixed bag to mortgages.
‚ÄúCertainly, the combination of prospective government cuts by DOGE and the disruptive impact of tariffs have made the mortgage bond market begin to price in additional cuts by the Fed later in 2025,‚Äù Green said, adding that a wildcard, however, is whether the tariffs reignite inflation, making further Fed cuts more complicated as it tries to balance its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability.
Ultimately, Green says, the big unknown is whether, at some point, the same economic uncertainty currently having a positive impact on interest rates will actually cause the US economy to tip into recession. 
‚ÄúA recession, particularly one with significant job losses, could cause any housing recovery to fizzle fairly quickly,‚Äù Green says.
The Fed is scheduled to meet next week and experts believe they will hold rates steady. And the uncertainty will prevail until it doesn‚Äôt.
Uncertainty abounds in the mortgage market, and it‚Äôs difficult to predict what‚Äôs going to happen next for real estate, home buyers, and the mortgage market, says Melissa Cohn, the Regional Vice President of William Raveis Mortgage and a 43-year veteran of the mortgage industry.
 ‚ÄúThe current environment is a risky environment,‚Äù Cohn says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre, in some ways, in new territory,‚Äù Cohn says.
While interest rates will likely be held steady next week, Cohn says a decrease can‚Äôt be ruled out.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very likely that the economy is slowing down as a result of everything that‚Äôs going on, and that the Fed will have a hard decision at their next meeting.‚Äù Cohn says, adding that if all of a sudden there is weakness spotted in the economy, that may force their hand to cut rates before they would like to.

74,2025-03-13,"Phone 2a set the standard for midrange phones, and Phone 3a builds upon that foundation.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here‚Äôs how it works.



Something to see here
The Nothing Phone 3a is definitely something to consider if you're in the market for a midrange smartphone. It has a competent Snapdragon processor, a great triple-camera system, and a unique design. Plus, there's plenty of AI around Nothing OS, and it tends to be actually useful.


Nailing the basics
The Nothing Phone 2a was the brand's first real attempt at a budget smartphone, and it got a lot of things right. With a capable processor and a flagship caliber display, the Phone 2a was a great option last year. However, it is getting older, and the newer Phone 3a beats it in many areas.
As a smartphone startup in the 2020s, Nothing is trying to do the impossible by shaking up a huge established market, and it's starting with the midrange sector. Nothing's Phone 2a set the standard for what a midrange phone should be, and now the company is improving on that standard with the latest Nothing Phone 3a. It's only slightly more expensive than its predecessor, but offers a more complete package.
Neither phone is fully equipped for use in the U.S., as carrier support is limited and they are only sold via the Nothing Beta Program. However, both devices are ideal for regions like Europe and India. Starting at ¬£329 or ‚Çπ24,999, the Nothing Phone 3a offers an excellent value proposition. But how does it compare to the Nothing Phone 2a? That's what we're going to find out in this comparison.

Both the Nothing Phone 3a and Phone 2a have a striking design, and they look quite similar. The two smartphones have a ""camera island"" with rear sensors positioned in the top center of their back. Of course, the Phone 3a's bigger lenses and triple camera system make that camera island look gigantic compared to that of the dual-camera Phone 2a.
The newer model is slightly larger than its predecessor, with the Phone 3a packing a 6.77-inch screen and the Phone 2a featuring a 6.7-inch display. They use similar display technologies, with support for 120Hz refresh rates and an OLED panel. However, the Phone 3a has an LTPO screen, which will result in smoother animations. Both phones support HDR10+ and have a peak brightness rating of 1,300 nits.

The bigger and better theme of the Phone 3a makes it physically larger than the Phone 2a. It measures 163.52 x 77.5 x 8.35mm and weighs 201 grams, whereas the Phone 2a measures 161.7 x 76.3 x 8.6mm and weighs 190 grams. Like most 6.7-inch phones, the Phone 3a's size can feel like a burden at times, and you'll feel the weight. Overall, it's pretty similar to the Phone 2a in that regard.

Nothing also improved the durability of the Phone 3a, supporting IP64 for dust and water resistance. Oddly, the company switched from Gorilla Glass this year, using Panda Glass on the Phone 3a. The important part is that Panda Glass is hardened, so it ideally won't crack easily, but some reports indicate Panda is easier to scratch than Gorilla.
By comparison, the Nothing Phone 2a features an IP54 rating for dust and water resistance, and Gorilla Glass 5.

Nothing made a big deal out of its switch from MediaTek to Qualcomm for its budget phones this year. The Nothing Phone 3a uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3, a budget chip recently optimized to improve AI performance. However, in benchmarks and real-world tests, we found that the Phone 3a is worse than the Phone 2a in gaming and graphics performance.
The MediaTek Dimensity 7200 Pro chipset in the Nothing Phone 2a seems to perform better in graphics tasks, while falling to the Phone 3a in CPU-based tasks. In our review, our own Nicholas Sutrich found that there was a 30-40% drop in benchmark FPS on the Phone 3a compared to the Phone 2a. This was reflected in real-world tests, too, even affecting relatively light games like Minecraft.

With that being said, both phones performed great in daily use. They can each be configured with 8GB or 12GB of RAM and either 128GB or 256GB of storage, but some configurations are only available in certain regions. In terms of battery, both phones have a 5,000mAh capacity. The Nothing Phone 3a charges slightly faster, with 50W support compared to the Phone 2a's 45W support.

With the Phone 3a, Nothing is promising three full OS upgrades and six total years of security patches. It's starting with Nothing OS 3.1, which is based on Android 15 and includes all the latest AI features from Nothing, including the Essential Space. Although the Phone 2a got the Nothing OS 3 update, it won't get all the new AI features. Its last platform update will be Android 17, so it still has plenty of support left.

For the first time, Nothing is offering a telephoto lens on the Nothing Phone 3a. For the regular Phone 3a, the 50MP f/2.0 Samsung telephoto camera only does 2x optical zoom, but it's better than nothing. The main camera is a 50MP f/1.88 Samsung sensor with a 1/1.57-inch sensor size, and it includes optical image stabilization. The third camera is an 8MP, f/2.2 Sony ultrawide camera with a 120-degree field of view.
Even without support for a high level of optical zoom, the telephoto lens in the Nothing Phone 3a helps it produce better zoom shots than its predecessor, as you can see in the image samples below.

The Nothing Phone 2a has a 50MP, f/1.9 Samsung GN9 main sensor that's very similar to the one on the Phone 3a. Notably, it still supports OIS and 4K30 video recording. That's paired with a 50MP, f/2.2 Samsung JN1 wide-angle lens with an 84.5-degree field of view.
On the front, both phones feature 32MP, f/2.2 cameras ‚Äî more than good enough to snap all the selfies you need.

If you're in the market for a budget Android phone, the Nothing Phone 3a makes a compelling case. It's better than the cheapest Samsung Galaxy A series phones, and it's cheaper than the OnePlus 13R and the Google Pixel 8a ‚Äî and the rumored Pixel 9a, for that matter. Due to the Nothing Phone 2a's limited availability, you won't find much of a discount on last-generation hardware. That's why the Phone 3a is our pick if you had to choose between it and the Phone 2a.
With that being said, the Phone 2a is still a worthy pick for a daily driver in 2025. The Phone 2a is still fast and runs the latest OS ‚Äî it's even faster than the Phone 3a in graphics performance. For the Nothing Phone 2a owners out there, an upgrade to the Phone 3a isn't necessary.


The Nothing midranger to buy
The Nothing Phone 3a is a more appealing option for people in regions where it is fully supported, like Europe and India. In those places, the Phone 3a blows away the competition in terms of value. It has a great processor, an even better camera system, and delivers a polished experience.


Still kicking
The Nothing Phone 2a might not be the most appealing choice for people in the market for a mid-ranger in 2025. There are newer and better options available, like the Phone 3a. But with Android 15 and new features, the Nothing Phone 2a will still be a capable phone for years to come.

Donald Trump‚Äôs pick to lead the Federal Housing Finance Agency ‚Äî the federal agency that oversees more than $7 trillion in mortgage loans ‚Äî is a man named Bill Pulte. Among the matters Pulte has been pressed on as senators weigh his confirmation is the fact that roughly 24,000 tweets disappeared from his account in November 2024, according to the data analytics site Social Blade.¬†

	Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) sent a letter to X CEO Linda Yaccarino late last month asking for the recovery of those tweets, which, she says, are important to knowing Pulte‚Äôs ‚Äúpolicy positions, temperament, and fitness to serve.‚Äù¬†

	X refused to turn over the tweets, saying Warren‚Äôs letter provided ‚Äúno legal basis that would permit or compel X‚Äù to provide them. But Rolling Stone reviewed more than 1,000 screenshots of tweets that showed Pulte engaged in petty fights and childish name-calling on the platform. (A sample shows Pulte calling various individuals ‚Äúa slob,‚Äù ‚Äúforeign freak and loser,‚Äù ‚Äúa total loser‚Äù and ‚Äúa theater kid forever.‚Äù) The deleted tweets also show Pulte tweeting to and about GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen, moves that would eventually place Pulte in a central role in an unfolding meme stock drama.¬†

	










	Pulte, who could receive a confirmation vote on Thursday, originally gained a large following on the platform formerly known as Twitter because of his reputation for giving money to people who tweeted at him. (His current X bio declares Pulte ‚ÄúThe Inventor of Twitter Philanthropy.‚Äù) In 2023, he developed an even more loyal following among a hyper-specific set of individuals: a group of Bed Bath & Beyond investors who were weaving increasingly elaborate theories that the tanking stock they purchased would somehow skyrocket ‚Äî or at least recover its value ‚Äî instead of becoming worthless, which is what happened when $BBBY shares extinguished in the fall of 2023, following the company‚Äôs well-publicized descent into bankruptcy.

	Bed Bath & Beyond was a meme stock that went viral among social media users in the wake of a similar frenzy with GameStop ‚Äî another brick-and-mortar mall fixture shorted by hedge funds. Wall Street bet on GameStop‚Äôs failure; its popularity online helped the company beat back the vultures.

	










	Similar efforts to revive Bed Bath & Beyond were a failure. In the wake of the company‚Äôs collapse, retail investors have come forward to share stories of losing tens of thousands of dollars in $BBBY. As chronicled by the documentary The Cult of the Dead Stock, many of those investors ‚Äî who gathered on Reddit and in Twitter Spaces, and tuned into a YouTube channel called The PPShow, hosted by a man named Alexander Zarac ‚Äî had pinned their hopes for the stock‚Äôs prospects on Cohen, the GameStop CEO.¬†

	Cohen took a $120 million stake in $BBBY in March 2022 ‚Äî more than his original investment in GameStop. In August 2022, after Cohen publicly disclosed he was betting on $BBBY to surge, the stock spiked. Cohen quickly cashed out, netting nearly $60 million. After Cohen sold, the stock cratered and ultimately crashed to less than $1 per share.¬†

	At the time, many amateur investors remained stubbornly convinced that Cohen was secretly plotting to swoop in and rescue the company from certain death. There was no evidence to support this idea, only increasingly deranged fantasies. Some desperate investors became fixated on Pulte ‚Äî who, at the time, occasionally interacted with Cohen on Twitter ‚Äî and, eventually, these investors became convinced that Pulte, the CEO of Pulte Capital, was a sort of oracle through whom Cohen was sending messages intended for them, the $BBBY faithful.¬†

	The tweets and videos reviewed by Rolling Stone show Pulte engaging with the $BBBY investor community after the company‚Äôs stock had already plummeted and been delisted, but during the time that it continued to be traded, as well as after shares were extinguished. (A representative for Pulte said that because the tweets have been deleted, he is unable to confirm the authenticity of the tweets reviewed by Rolling Stone. That representative added, ‚ÄúMr. Pulte has already addressed these matters during his hearings and remains committed to the confirmation process and his dedication to serving the American people.‚Äù)

	During that period in 2023, Pulte also appeared on livestreams alongside Zarac, the host of the PPShow. In one characteristic exchange, Pulte was asked: ‚ÄúWhat are your thoughts on Teddy and what do you think RC‚Äôs trying to do with it?‚Äù (Cohen trademarked the name ‚ÄúTeddy,‚Äù fueling speculation among $BBBY investors that it would be the name of a re-branded Bed Bath & Beyond. It turned out to be for Cohen‚Äôs line of children‚Äôs books.) Pulte answered: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs up to something. There‚Äôs something that‚Äôs caused him to behave the way he‚Äôs behaved with this situation. They‚Äôre not going to put that in an SEC filing.‚Äù At another point, Pulte was asked about his interest in the stock. He was captured in the documentary saying, ‚ÄúI just like the stock, I like Ryan Cohen.‚Äù¬†

	Deleted tweets reviewed by Rolling Stone also indicated, at various points, Pulte‚Äôs efforts to distance himself from the $BBBY fiasco after the fact. He replied to one longtime $BBBY investor in November 2023: ‚ÄúI do not know if RC [is] involved in any stock or situation. As I‚Äôve said, you should NOT construe anything I say about any stock, GME, or BBBYQ. I have nothing to do with BBBYQ and do not own any of it. Thank you.‚Äù

	










	Nevertheless, on Reddit, people have continued to debate the extent to which Pulte was knowingly encouraging a fantasy that $BBBY would recover its value after it was delisted. ‚ÄúHe knows exactly what he‚Äôs doing with his constant innuendos,‚Äù one wrote. Another posted: ‚ÄúHe has done a lot of things to make us believe he is hinting at things.‚Äù (A representative for Pulte insisted he never engaged or played into any fantasy.)¬†

	Some have speculated, in the documentary and elsewhere, that Pulte‚Äôs ultimate motivation for ingratiating himself with $BBBY investors was to harness the power of this enthusiastic and, frankly, gullible group of investors as a grassroots shareholder army of sorts with the power to influence PulteGroup, Inc.‚Äî the home building company started by his grandfather. Bill Pulte has a long and bitter history with the company‚Äôs executives.¬†

	Fueling that speculation is the fact that, at an event that Pulte held with Zarac and $BBBY investors two and half months after the stock was extinguished, attendees were offered PulteGroup shares ‚Äî on the condition they hold on to them for 20 years. (The fine print on the contract included other stipulations, including one that gave an associate of Pulte‚Äôs ‚Äúfull authority to vote and speak on behalf of the shareholder at any and all meetings.‚Äù)

	At the end of October, the month before he scrubbed his X account, Pulte posted: ‚ÄúToday, in an effort to DO THE RIGHT THING for people who have been wronged by Overpaid Executives, I am offering a Fund to reimburse certain people for the monies invested in $BBBY. While I can‚Äôt help everyone I want to help some most affected. Talk is cheap. It takes money‚Ä¶‚Äù Followed by a second tweet that read; ‚ÄúThe First $5000 for somebody affected by BBBY Overpaid Executives will go to‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

	It‚Äôs not clear, because the tweets have been deleted, how many people who lost money on $BBBY took Pulte up on the offer. At least one person replied to say they were ‚Äústanding by with my shares‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

	‚ÄúUnderstood, you don‚Äôt have to take my free money,‚Äù Pulte replied.

78,2025-03-13,"Dollar General (DG+1.02%), often seen as a barometer for the economic health of value-conscious consumers, delivered mixed financial results in its latest earnings report, yet CEO Todd Vasos pointedly warned investors about deteriorating consumer conditions.
‚ÄúOur customers continue to report that their financial situation has worsened over the last year as they have been negatively impacted by ongoing inflation,‚Äù Vasos remarked during an earnings call Thursday. ‚ÄúMany of our customers report they only have enough money for basic essentials, with some noting that they have had to sacrifice even on the necessities.‚Äù 
That‚Äôs not a subtle warning, considering Dollar General‚Äôs core customers often struggle to get by even when the economy is on solid footing.
‚ÄúWith all the uncertainty due to the tariff war heating up, consumers and businesses are becoming more defensive,‚Äù said Albert Williams, an economics professor at Nova Southeastern University. 
He adds that consumer confidence in the economy has fallen and is now showing up in results at retail stores. The significance is that these economic pressures are directly impacting the average American.
‚ÄúWe urgently need to see more stability in the economy,‚Äù Williams said. ‚ÄúUncertainty is affecting consumers, and it is making forecasting of earnings much more difficult for retail stores like Dollar General.‚Äù
The stock was up in pre-market trading as the company announced it had beat expectations for the key holiday period. And the company expects annual same-store sales growth between 1.2% and 2.2%. The high end is slightly above analysts‚Äô average estimate of a 1.82% rise.
Despite the rosier outlook for 2025, profit fell short in the quarter that ended in January. Earnings were 87 cents a share, trailing Wall Street‚Äôs average projection of $1.50. The company cited store closings and other internal adjustments as reasons for the miss.
Dollar General operates 20,000 stores across the United States, with plans to open 500 more this year. The chain has managed to carve out a niche even as other dollar stores have struggled. Big Lots (BIG) went into bankruptcy while Dollar Tree has struggled to make its acquisition of Family Dollar profitable.

79,2025-03-13,"Iran says it has turned much of its reserves into gold, as gold imports soar to three times the level of last year.
Tehran, Iran ‚Äì Iran has been importing tonnes of gold in the past few months as it hunkers down for more hardships under the United States‚Äôs ‚Äúmaximum pressure‚Äù policy.
Iran has turned more to gold as a safe haven investment for more than a decade as it weathered never-ending economic storms exacerbated by sanctions over its nuclear programme and regional influence.
But the government of President Masoud Pezeshkian, who took over after an election last summer in the aftermath of his predecessor‚Äôs death in a helicopter crash, has taken it to new levels in the face of pressure from US President Donald Trump.
By January 19, the end of Dey, the 10th month of the Iranian calendar year, Iran had imported at least 81 metric tonnes of gold bullion, according to the country‚Äôs customs administration.
This was reportedly more than 300 percent higher in terms of value compared with the corresponding period of the previous year, and 234 percent more in terms of weight.
In late February, new customs chief Foroud Asgari told reporters that gold imports earned for exporting goods have surpassed 100 tonnes, without elaborating further.
That would signal a more than three-fold increase compared with the 30-tonne total of the previous year.
Central bank chief Mohammad Reza Farzin claimed in December that 20 percent of the country‚Äôs foreign currency reserves have been turned into gold, and Iran possesses one of the highest ratios of gold to foreign exchange in the world.
Mohammad Ali Dehghan Dehnavi, the head of Iran‚Äôs Trade Promotion Organization, said last month that the country‚Äôs trade balance is again negative this year, but ‚Äúmost of that is due to the increase in gold imports‚Äù.
Iranian authorities have not disclosed where they imported the gold from, or what they exported to get it.
Some reports have indicated Iran got part of the gold from Russia in exchange for suicide drones. Iranian officials have not commented on the claim, maintaining that they only exported some drones to Russia months before the start of the Ukraine war.
The increasing focus on gold has not been limited to the Iranian government, which has also been scrambling to plug its budget holes by significantly raising taxes.
Iranians have long been hedging against their freefalling national currency by purchasing foreign currencies and various gold products, especially coins minted by the central bank.
Authorities have also been heavily encouraging gold purchases in recent months.
Dozens of services and applications have sprouted up, with large public advertising campaigns telling people they can turn their savings into gold for as little as the equivalent of $1 or less.
But not all of them have proven gold reserves, prompting authorities to periodically warn citizens to only buy from certified vendors to avoid being duped.
Superstition played in too, with thousands queueing in front of gold stores last August to buy based on the belief that purchasing gold on the 13th day of the Islamic month of Safar would bring good fortune.
Those people, and others who bought gold this year, are comfortably in the green as the value of gold ‚Äì both driven by global demand and local upheavals ‚Äì has risen much higher than Iran‚Äôs 35 percent inflation.
The central bank has also been holding a string of new gold coin pre-sales, with delivery dates of up to six months. Some of those coins have been sold at higher prices than their intrinsic global value.
The central bank planned to issue new gold certificates before the end of the current Iranian calendar year on March 20 as well but postponed it to next year.
The monetary regulator has not announced conditions for issuing the state-backed certificates, only saying the plan was delayed ‚Äúconsidering the economic conditions of the end of the year and the stock market‚Äù.
TEDPIX, the main stock market index in the Tehran Stock Exchange, reached all-time highs in January but has been undergoing a highly volatile period as the US and Israel threaten to bomb Iran and the country‚Äôs economic woes worsen.
After Iran was cut off from the global payment network and found its access to foreign currencies heavily constrained, gold was increasingly favoured by authorities as a way to decrease dependence on the US dollar and to hold assets with intrinsic value to use as a medium for trade.
Iran is believed to have flown in most of its imported gold through Tehran‚Äôs Imam Khomeini International Airport to limit potential logistical challenges linked with transporting large volumes.
The government is also trying to expand local gold production in the coming years, as it currently plays a relatively modest role due to lacklustre investments in exploration and mining operations.
But while the gold strategy may yield short-term gains for an economy under immense pressure, it has serious limitations in curbing runaway prices.
Economist and market analyst Mehdi Haghbaali told Al Jazeera that the central bank‚Äôs gold coin sales to the public are unlikely to be very effective.
He explained that excessive money supply growth ‚Äì a main reason behind perennial inflation in Iran ‚Äì cannot fully explain the devaluation of the national currency in recent months, as it has been closely linked with geopolitical turmoil.
‚ÄúBy selling gold coins, the central bank supposedly tries to signal its confidence and its huge reserves of foreign assets ‚Äì either in foreign exchange or in gold,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúBut even if this is the case, the auctions will be futile. The central bank and the government‚Äôs cards are known to the public, and the huge fiscal deficit and the forthcoming trade difficulties under the new US administration are all very well known to market players. As a result, no matter how much gold the central bank sells, it will fail to change public perceptions, thereby having almost zero impact on the prices.‚Äù
Haghbaali said only improved macroeconomic and political conditions could have a meaningful impact on prices, rendering the gold sales ‚Äúalmost a waste of energy and resources‚Äù.
The vast quantities of imported gold and the expected murkiness surrounding it amid the sanctions have led to more accusations of wrongdoing.
Yashar Soltani, an independent Iranian investigative journalist, made headlines last week after he claimed that more than 61 tonnes of gold were ‚Äúmissing‚Äù and had not been offered on the market.
He also pointed out that gold coins are being sold at inflated prices, strengthening longstanding accusations by local politicians and economists against successive Iranian governments that they manipulate rates to boost short-term gains.
The central bank issued a short statement to reject the claims without elaborating, only saying that it would pursue a legal case against the journalist through the judiciary.
State media rushed to defend the authorities‚Äô gold strategy as well, with government-run IRNA arguing that it makes sense to sell parts of central bank gold reserves as it offers quick liquidity under sanctions.

Today, in the Calculated Risk Real Estate Newsletter: The ""Home ATM"" Mostly Closed in Q4
A brief excerpt: During the housing bubble, many homeowners borrowed heavily against their perceived home equity - jokingly calling it the ‚ÄúHome ATM‚Äù - and this contributed to the subsequent housing bust, since so many homeowners had negative equity in their homes when house prices declined. 
...
Here is the quarterly increase in mortgage debt from the Federal Reserve‚Äôs Financial Accounts of the United States - Z.1 (sometimes called the Flow of Funds report) released today. In the mid ‚Äò00s, there was a large increase in mortgage debt associated with the housing bubble.

In Q4 2024, mortgage debt increased $100 billion, down from $105 billion in Q3, and down from the cycle peak of $459 billion in Q2 2021. Note the almost 7 years of declining mortgage debt as distressed sales (foreclosures and short sales) wiped out a significant amount of debt.

However, some of this debt is being used to increase the housing stock (purchase new homes), so this isn‚Äôt all Mortgage Equity Withdrawal (MEW).

Asian equities were mostly lower overnight, though Malaysia and Pakistan managed gains while Vietnam and Taiwan underperformed.
China‚Äôs markets continued a downtrend from yesterday as US tariff uncertainty continued to rattle global markets. Mainland investors continued their net buying streak, though at a level much lower than yesterday, which was near the all-time daily record. Meanwhile, there was a slight rotation factor as value sectors managed gains. Gold miners and oil led gains on geopolitical uncertainty and some reports bullish on commodity and rare earth prices. Government bonds continued to sell off, sending yields slightly higher.
Social media and online advertising platform Weibo reported Q4 and 2025 results this morning after the close in Hong Kong and before the US market opened. Revenue was slightly lower than expected, while net income was slightly higher than most estimates.
User growth was better than expected, while advertising revenue was down year over year. The company is in a similar position to Baidu, in which the macroeconomic environment does not lend itself well to advertising spending. At the same time, competition in space is increasing from short video platforms and AI enablers such as Alibaba. However, the company did announce a significant dividend of $0.82 per share, which represents a payout ratio of over 40%.
The electric vehicle (EV) ecosystem was lower overnight, and China EV names are selling off in the US this morning. This was after a run-up on positive vehicle sales growth in China. This is one of the many recently outperforming sectors that sold off overnight, including AI, robotics, and consumer plays. This is likely stemming from some short-term profit taking, which we have noticed can be more of a factor in China compared to the US and Europe.
One of China‚Äôs top financial publications, the Securities Daily, published an article about the potential for the CNY to rise further against the US dollar. This would run counter to the narrative of long-term higher tariffs, though if domestic consumption really increases, then demand for China assets could rise despite the trade situation weighing on the currency.
The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech indexes both closed lower by -0.58% and -1.67%, respectively, on volume that decreased by -16% from yesterday. Mainland investors bought a net $698 million worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks via Southbound Stock Connect. The top-performing sectors were Energy, which gained +1.08%, Materials, which gained +0.47%, and Information Technology, which gained +0.43%. Meanwhile, the worst-performing sectors were Consumer Staples, which fell --1.84 %; Consumer Discretionary, which fell --1.75 %; and Real Estate, which fell -1.27%.
Shanghai, Shenzhen, and the STAR Board all closed lower by -0.39%, -1.12%, and -2.11%, respectively. The top-performing sectors were Energy, which gained +2.66%; Utilities, which gained +0.85%; and Materials, which gained +0.39%. Meanwhile, the worst-performing sectors were Information Technology, which fell --2.22 %; Communication Services, which fell --0.94 %; and Real Estate, which fell -0.84%.

One of the trends that Donald Trump and his supporters wanted to reverse with his big speech to a joint session of Congress on March 4 was a steady erosion of his job-approval ratings in the polls from the mildly positive ‚Äúhoneymoon‚Äù levels he registered just after returning to the White House.
It didn‚Äôt work. And there‚Äôs increasing evidence concerns about the economy and reaction to Elon Musk‚Äôs assault on federal services and employees are beginning to take a toll on the new administration‚Äôs base of support.
Silver Bulletin‚Äôs comprehensive and sophisticated analysis of the polls show Trump‚Äôs approval-rating averages now clearly underwater at 47.6 percent positive and 49.2 percent negative. RealClearPolitics, which produces simple arithmetical averages from a database that includes several dubious pro-Trump pollsters, shows his net job-approval averages dropping from 1.2 percent on March 4 to minus-0.4 percent on March 17.
Beyond the overall numbers, the most recent polls show that worries about the economy continue to hound the 47th president. Here‚Äôs how Emerson College explained the trends:
As President Trump reaches his first 50 days in office, his approval rating has declined from 49%-41% to 47%-45%, reflecting a nation deeply divided ‚Ä¶ Voters are most supportive of Trump‚Äôs immigration policy, but they disapprove of his handling of the economy, believe tariffs will hurt economic growth, and are skeptical of his cryptocurrency policy.
Polls since Trump took office have regularly suggested that even Trump supporters thought he was inadequately focused on inflation and prices, which could mean deeper trouble for him if his current wave of tariffs and trade-war threats produce higher retail prices, as most economists expect. The most recent plunge in stock prices may produce additional jitters as predictions of a possible recession return to news reports.
A March 13 Quinnipiac survey shows that concerns over the economy are actually more intense than they were at the end of the Biden administration. The percentage of voters describing the economy as either ‚Äúnot so good‚Äù or ‚Äúpoor‚Äù has increased from 64 percent in December to 76 percent now.
A March 12 Reuters-Ipsos poll shows 60 percent of Americans believe the country is on the ‚Äúwrong track‚Äù on inflation, and among Republicans, only 45 percent believe we‚Äôre on the ‚Äúright track‚Äù on inflation.
Where is Trump losing ground among the electorate? Polls differ, but the latest, the above-mentioned Emerson poll, showed Latinos disapproving of Trump‚Äôs job performance by a 51.6 to 35.2 percent margin. Another post-speech poll from TIPP Insights shows self-identified moderates disapproving of the job Trump‚Äôs doing by a 54 to 33 percent margin. Similarly, a March 12 AtlasIntel poll placed Trump far underwater among self-identified independents, with 62 percent disapproving of his job performance. It appears that the less MAGA-oriented elements of the electorate where Trump made important gains last November may be proving soft spots in his coalition, which isn‚Äôt surprising since he‚Äôs now responsible for a status quo with which a lot of Americans are chronically unhappy. The chaos in his administration probably isn‚Äôt helping. As Axios reports, the occasional pollsters who ask about Elon Musk and DOGE are sensing some negative vibes:
In a Feb. 13-18 Washington Post-Ipsos¬†poll, a net 34% of respondents said they approved of how Musk was handling his job, compared to 49% disapproving and 14% not sure.

The poll displayed a stark divide based on party ID, with just 6% of Democrats approving of how Musk has handled his job compared to 70% of Republicans. But when asked if they approved of Musk shutting down federal government programs he deemed unnecessary, a smaller slice of Republicans (56%) gave their blessing, while 25% said they weren‚Äôt sure and 18% disapproved ‚Ä¶

Over half of respondents (55%) in a Quinnipiac University poll conducted Feb. 13 to 17 said Musk has too much power in making decisions affecting the U.S., while 36% think he has about the right amount of power.

A Pew survey of U.S. adults taken Jan. 27 to Feb. 2 showed that Americans had more negative (54%) than positive (42%) views of Musk (DOGE‚Äôs dissection of the federal government has¬†dramatically escalated¬†since the poll was conducted).
The more recent Quinnipiac poll shows self-identified independents disapproving of Musk and DOGE by a 68 to 28 percent margin.
If alarm over arbitrary federal budget cuts and employee layoffs coincides with troublesome economic news, Trump may soon find himself back in the more decisively negative public-opinion territory he has inhabited for much of his political career.

87,2025-03-13,"Disclaimer: The analyst who wrote this piece owns shares of Strategy (MSTR).Strike (STRK), the preferred stock issued by bitcoin buyer Strategy (MSTR) has been listed for just over a month and is currently 3% higher than at its Feb. 5 introduction. Strategy's common stock, on the other hand, is 20% lower over the same period.
Preferred stock like STRK can be thought of as a hybrid of equity and debt. Holders have a greater right to dividend payments than common stock owners if the company makes them and also to the company's assets in the event of a liquidation. STRK is a perpetual issue, which lacks a maturity date (like equity) and pays a fixed dividend (like debt).
Those features mean preferred stock tends to be less volatile than the common stock. That certainly seems to be the case for STRK. According to Strategy's dashboard, STRK has a 26% correlation with MSTR and a slightly negative -7% correlation with bitcoin (BTC). It's also less volatile, at 49%, compared with bitcoin‚Äôs roughly 60% and MSTR‚Äôs volatility exceeding 100%.
Last week, Strategy announced a $21 billion at-the-market (ATM) offering for STRK. That is, it's prepared to sell up to that amount of the stock at the current market price over a period of time. If all the STRK is sold, the company would face a total annual dividend bill of about $1.68 billion. 
Generating that amount of cash means the company would either to sell common stock through an ATM offering ‚Äî unlikely given the depressed share price as of late ‚Äîor use cash generated from operations or proceeds from any convertible debt raised.
STRK offers an 8% annual dividend yield based on its $100 liquidation preference and at the currently price of $87.45, offers an effective yield of around 9%. As with debt, the higher the STRK price, the lower the yield, and vice versa. 
STRK also includes a feature allowing each share to be converted into 0.1 share of common stock, equivalent to a 10-to-1 ratio, when the MSTR price reaches or exceeds $1,000. Strategy stock closed at $262.55 on Wednesday, for the option to become viable it would have to appreciate significantly, offering potential upside beyond STRK‚Äôs fixed dividend.
As an income-generating product with lower volatility, STRK presents a more stable option with potential upside. However, the massive ATM offering could impact this potential upside, similar to how ATM share sales have affected the common stock‚Äôs performance.

88,2025-03-13,"Business Insider Edition 
As I've gotten older, I've realized that certain people have an undeniable force surrounding them. My grandfather has always been one of those people in my life. Ever since I was little, I've been enamored by him. He moves through the world with an unwavering sense of confidence, a blend of street smarts and book smarts that makes him both inspiring and, at times, maddening.

        He's the kind of wise where, even when I don't like his advice, I know deep down I should listen.
    

        The year I needed his advice the most was in 2019, the year I graduated from college, which happened to be the same year my grandmother died. As my senior year wound down, I had precisely one job offer. It was with a small event planning company, offering a laughably low salary and no benefits. It wasn't the dream job, but it was a job, and who was I to turn down my only option?
    

        I called my grandfather. He didn't sugarcoat it: ""It's not a good deal."" So, I turned it down.
    

        A few weeks later, I graduated with no job and no plan. I felt lost. My grandfather, meanwhile, was adjusting to life without his wife. I asked whether I could stay with him in Birmingham, Alabama, for a few weeks while I figured things out. He agreed, and soon after, I moved in with him and his rescue dog.
    

        Since I'd only ever visited with my parents before, those first few days were spent observing, trying to understand his rhythms. Shoes off at the door. One trash can for trash, one for garbage (I still don't know the difference). Beds must be made. Water cups can stay by the sink, but everything else must be hand-washed ‚Äî though I later convinced him the dishwasher was worth using. Eggs are cooked with butter (lots of it), never oil.
    

        Not only does he have rules, but he also has a routine. Saturdays are for dinner with friends; Sundays are for family. And at the time I moved in with him, he was 80 years old and still working as an ENT surgeon. While he used to work five days a week, during this time he worked two days a week; on Mondays he performed surgery, and on Tuesdays he did office visits. Again, an inspiration.
    

        I had planned to stay for only a few weeks while I applied for jobs in big cities such as New York and Los Angeles ‚Äî anywhere but Birmingham, Alabama. But the job search was harder than I expected, and to my surprise, I found myself enjoying Birmingham more than I ever anticipated. I settled into a routine. While my career felt stalled, I was growing in other ways.
    

Living with my grandfather taught me discipline and structure in a way college never had. His rules, which at first felt arbitrary, became the guardrails I needed. He never told me what I wanted to hear, only what I needed to. And most of all, he showed me what it meant to love your work, because to still be a practicing surgeon in your 80s and enjoy every second of it? That's something special.
    

        I had always thought highly of my grandfather, but living with him helped deepen my admiration. It's easy to think of grandparents as relics of a different time, and while I never saw my grandfather as outdated, I also never saw us as equals. He was someone to look up to. But then, somewhere along the way, we became friends. Best friends.
    

        We gossiped, laughed, and cried together. He consoled me. We watched ""Ozark"" every night until we ran out of episodes. I read romantic novels on the patio while he smoked a cigar and told me stories about his trips to Miami with my grandmother.
    

        Weeks turned into months. Months turned into years. We lived together through the pandemic, through the time he got hit by a car and severely broke his ankle, through his retirement, through my first job and my first resignation, and through the moment I met the boy I'm about to marry.
    

        I stayed for only about three years, but they were three years of profound growth, both personally and professionally. Had they not happened the way they did, I know I'd be a different person. My grandfather is the reason I'm now driven, more confident, and surer of myself.
    

        It's easy to feel like moving in with family after graduation is a failure. Like it's a step backward. But for me, it was three steps forward. And for all three of them, I have my grandfather to thank.

Easwaran, Balbin and Avadhanula presenting ElastaScan at Aggie Pitch. 
Texas A&M
In rural India, the threat of venomous snakebites looms large, with severe consequences such as paralysis, fever, and convulsions often following these dangerous encounters.
For farmers working in fields, the reality is grim; an estimated one million snakebites occur annually in India, leading to around 58,000 fatalities.
In areas devoid of quick medical access, the impact can be life-altering, often resulting in amputations and death.
This reality hit home for Anish Easwaran, a Texas A&M biomedical engineering student, during his freshman year while serving as a medical assistant in India.
He witnessed the aftermath of a snakebite when a local farmer arrived at the hospital after a harrowing 30-minute journey only to learn that doctors were forced to amputate his leg.
Easwaran‚Äôs experience ignited a sense of urgency to devise a solution that could prevent such tragedies.
Thus, Aegis Armor was born, a low-cost protective device designed to shield farmers in agricultural regions from snakebites.
Unlike existing solutions that cost over $50, which can be nearly half a farmer‚Äôs monthly wage, Aegis Armor is priced under $5.
The customizable armor, made of impenetrable materials, wraps around the lower leg and ankle to prevent direct contact between the skin and snakes.
‚ÄúSeeing the immediate consequences of a snakebite made me realize that engineering could be a key part of the solution,‚Äù Easwaran said.
With his business partner, fellow Texas A&M student Kaushik Avadhanula, Easwaran launched Aegis Armor, which has already delivered over 5,000 units to farmers and accumulated over 13,000 pending orders.
As part of his efforts, Easwaran was selected as a Clinton Global Innovation Fellow, a recognition awarded to emerging social entrepreneurs.
This opportunity allows him to expand the reach of Aegis Armor beyond India, with plans underway to introduce the device to farmers in Vietnam.
Easwaran emphasizes the importance of understanding the local context when launching a new product.
He and Avadhanula make it a point to visit communities where their products will be used.
‚ÄúWhen we expand to a new market, we immerse ourselves in the local environment to ensure our design meets the community‚Äôs needs,‚Äù he explained.
Through these visits, they discovered critical insights into user preferences.
Earlier armor designs featured an outer layer of recycled car leather resembling industrial gear, an aesthetic that failed to resonate with users.
Conversations with farmers revealed a desire for more personalized designs, especially for women and children who often engage in traditional clothing practices.
In response to this feedback, the team incorporated local fabric patterns, allowing communities to contribute their materials to the armor.
‚ÄúThis small change made a significant difference. People felt more invested in the solution and began viewing it as a part of their daily lives,‚Äù Easwaran noted.
In addition to Aegis Armor, Easwaran collaborates with classmates Richard Balbin and Kaushik Avadhanula on another venture called ElastaScan.
This device aims to assist physical therapists in monitoring muscle movements during rehabilitation.
ElastaScan tracks muscle activation during physical activity using sensors, providing therapists with valuable patient form and recovery data.
This dual focus on snakebite prevention and rehabilitation reflects Easwaran‚Äôs commitment to improving health outcomes for communities facing significant challenges.

E-book readers, or simply E-readers, have become quite popular these days, especially with the introduction of Color E Ink displays. While the big names like Amazon‚Äôs Kindle and Kobo have mostly stuck to their old designs until recently, other brands have started expanding their reach, launching no less than 5 or so new models each year. While that number might be a sign of a healthy market, it also translates to more waste in the long run, especially with devices that are often seen as difficult if not impossible to repair.
One player in this market, however, is trying to change that perception. Just a few months back, Supernote launched its latest model, the A5 2X, better known as the Manta. While it boasts its ultra-thin design, what was really unique about it was how it promoted its repairable and sustainable design. Of course, being able to open up the tablet‚Äôs back is pointless if you can‚Äôt replace broken parts inside, so Supernote‚Äôs new DIY zone makes good on that promise and also opens the door to something its competitors won‚Äôt even dare to do.
Designer: Supernote







For a product to be truly repairable, you need more than just easy access to damaged parts. You also need access to replacement parts for those, otherwise you‚Äôd still be stuck with a dead device. That‚Äôs why iFixit, the champion of the self-repair movement, has partnered with big brands to sell those spares. Supernote might not be on iFixit‚Äôs list yet, but it‚Äôs doing exactly the same thing.







The DIY Zone lists the parts of the Supernote Manta that can be replaced, which includes not just the battery but even the motherboard. The latter is a single unit, so you can‚Äôt really replace individual components like the microSD card reader or some chips. That‚Äôs still a huge step up from other brands that don‚Äôt even make their devices easily repairable on any level. Just like iFixit, Supernote also includes guides on how to pull those repairs off, and they‚Äôre pretty darn easy compared to any teardown we‚Äôve seen.


What makes Supernote‚Äôs new DIY focus is in the name itself. More than just repairs, it is actually encouraging owners to create custom designs, at least for some of the parts and accessories. To be specific, it has guides on how to create custom pens and folio covers for the Supernote Manta, though you‚Äôll still need to buy the core components for those. Considering the Supernote Refill for the stylus costs only $45, that‚Äôs not exactly a bad deal, especially as it saves you time and effort messing with electronics.

Supernote is definitely a breath of fresh air in this rapidly growing market that churns out and throws away devices like they‚Äôre cheap, disposable products. Indeed, the earliest Kindles and its ilk had that image, but the rising prices of these devices should probably give consumers pause for thought. Hopefully, this DIY Zone won‚Äôt be a short-lived endeavor and will spur competitors like reMarkable, Bigme, and Onyx BOOX to follow suit. Big shots like Amazon and Kobo, however, are unlikely to go down that route for a long, long time.

For February, Realtor.com reported inventory was up 27.5% YoY, but still down 22.9% compared to the 2017 to 2019 same month levels.¬†¬†Now - on a weekly basis - inventory is up 27.8% YoY.

Realtor.com has monthly and weekly data on the existing home market. Here is their weekly report:¬†Weekly Housing Trends View‚ÄîData for Week Ending March 8, 2025‚Ä¢ Active inventory increased, with for-sale homes 27.8% above year-ago levels

The number of homes for sale has now been higher than the previous year for 70 consecutive weeks. This continued rise in active inventory is in part due to less active buyers. With more choices available, buyers can afford to be more selective, putting pressure on sellers to price competitively.

93,2025-03-13,"The Nothing Phone 3a Pro and Google Pixel 8a are both affordable Android phones that are great for entry-level users.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here‚Äôs how it works.



A stand-out design
If you're looking for a phone that will really stand out, the Nothing Phone 3a Pro employs a cool, transparent design with a unique Glyph interface and lights that have practical purposes beyond just aesthetics. It's a pretty powerful phone, too, for the price.


Solid performance for price
The Google Pixel 8a still remains a solid performer with more than decent specs and support that will last for many more years. It's not as flashy in design, but it's elegant, comfortable to hold, and powerful for the price.
If you‚Äôre in the market for an affordable, entry-level Android phone with premium features, the Nothing Phone 3a Pro vs. Google Pixel 8a are two good options. Both come in at under $500 but have impressive specs that suggest they cost much more. Both employ beautiful designs and software and security support for years. But they are very different phones in terms of the look and what they have to offer that makes them stand out. So, let‚Äôs dive deeper into how they compare.

The Nothing Phone 3a Pro, which launched in early March 2025, looks like no other phone you have come across with a cool, transparent exterior design that is inspired by Japanese iconography. This includes clean, geometric shapes on a flat surface with straight sides. Nothing (pun intended) on the market looks like this phone, Nicholas Sutrich enthuses in his Nothing Phone 3a Pro review.
Made of high-grade tempered glass with machined aluminum accents and a 6.77-inch 2,392 x 1,080 FHD+ AMOLED, you‚Äôll get a decent 120Hz refresh rate for keeping up with everything from multitasking to gaming. There‚Äôs also an impressive up to 3,000 nits brightness, so the phone is viewable in just about any scenario, even direct sunlight.
The Glyph interface sets it apart. The purpose of this unique design is to help you avoid distractions by using light and sound patterns to indicate notifications and ringtones. Rather than constantly looking at your phone, a unique color and pattern of light will tell you who‚Äôs calling, for example, or what type of notification you‚Äôre getting. You can also leverage the Glyph interface for things like music playback, a camera timer, and volume.
Finished in black or grey, the Nothing Phone 3a Pro has a 91.4% screen-to-body ratio and an Essential key on its side for taking screenshots, long pressing to record your voice, or double pressing to open Essential Space. This is a spot that organizes your content, like screenshots, voice notes, and text notes, into neat and logical categories for easy retrieval and action prompts. You can customize the look of widgets and use the smart drawer to automatically organize apps by category.
Equipped with a 5,000mAh battery, the Nothing Phone 3a can last all day: Sutrich says it even easily lasts beyond a day, up to two for light users. It supports 50W fast charging as well as 7.5W reverse wireless charging. It comes with either 128GB or 256GB non-expandable storage.
The phone boasts an IP64 rating, so it‚Äôs not quite as rugged as others, but Sutrich says it feels durable with a nice, grippy texture, even with the sides being made of plastic. Additional features include Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, fingerprint sensor, face unlock, stereo speakers, and a 360¬∞ antenna. It comes with three years of Android OS updates and six years of security updates.

Launched in May 2024, the Google Pixel 8a comes in Aloe, Bay, Porcelain, or Obsidian. With a matte composite back, matte aluminum frame, and Corning Gorilla Glass 3, it has a smaller 6.1-inch Actua 2,400 x 1,080 OLED display with an adaptive refresh rate that can go from 60-120Hz, depending on the task at hand, and up to 2,000 nits peak brightness.
Sutrich says in his Pixel 8a review that the Google Pixel 8a is his favorite in terms of Pixel designs with a unique camera bar, rounded corners, and a ‚Äúheavenly‚Äù feeling matte finish. Even though the back is plastic, he says it doesn‚Äôt feel as such, looking and feeling like a more premium device than it is.
The phone boasts an all-day 4,492mAh battery that can extend to 72 hours using Extreme Battery Saver mode. It supports both 7.5W wireless charging via Qi and 18W fast charging, but Sutrich says it charges very slowly, reaching only 33% after half an hour. Get it with 128GB or 256GB storage.
Google throws in some nice add-ons with purchases, including three months of Google One with 100GB cloud storage, three months of YouTube Premium, and six months of Fitbit Premium. There are also useful features like Family Link with parental controls if you‚Äôre getting this device for a child.
With an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance, the Google Pixel 8a has Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, fingerprint sensor, face unlock, stereo speakers, and two mics with noise suppression. You‚Äôll get support for even longer with seven years of Feature Drops and as long for security support along with built-in Google VPN, Titan M2 security, anti-malware, anti-phishing, and an auto security and privacy hub.

Now, let‚Äôs dive into what makes these two phones stand out when it comes to usability and features.
The Nothing Phone 3a Pro runs on Nothing OS 3.1, which is based on Android 15. It has a Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 processor with an AI engine and up to 20GB RAM Booster and a Hexagon Tensor Accelerator (HTA) that boosts AI performance. It comes with 8GB or 12GB RAM to keep up with all your daily needs.
The Essential Space really stands out on this phone, making it simple to organize and catalog all your contents. Soon, the phone will also be able to transcribe on the fly, condense meeting notes, and even pull together to-dos based on your information. Now, it can do things like generate personalized suggestions, summaries, or action points, all leveraging integrated AI.
Sutrich says Essential Space, which is still in beta, is ‚Äúvery cool‚Äù though less useful than he had hoped. It‚Äôs basically a digital replacement for a daily planner, and it works well in accomplishing this. How useful you find it will be a personal thing.
The feature Sutrich really loves and calls a game-changer is the ability to take notes or voice memos on the fly by pressing a single key. As soon as he made a recording, like something he remembered while driving, the AI engine in the phone organized it neatly and provided a summary the next time he looked at his phone.
Gamers will appreciate the steel vapor chamber, which ensures reduced average versus 60-70FPS on the Nothing Phone 2a. However, he notes that the phone never got warm to the touch and he didn‚Äôt experience any performance issues. Nonetheless, his observations are worth keeping in mind if you plan to use the phone for gaming.
From a security standpoint, all content is stored locally on the phone, and any data sent to the cloud for processing is encrypted and then deleted once the task is done. There‚Äôs also built-in ChatGPT.

The Google Pixel 8a runs on the G3 chip and boasts less RAM at 8GB, but it‚Äôs still a pretty powerful phone. It has all the usual Google goodies, including Gemini access and the Gemini assistant, and features like live translate. You can also enjoy features like Circle to Search, call screen, clear calling, hold for me, wait times, and smart replies. Extra safety features include crisis alerts and car crash detection.
The Family Link area of the phone is useful for parents with teens and tweens who want to be able to monitor usage, set time limits, and ensure they are only accessing appropriate apps and information.
Performance of this phone varies, Sutrich notes, based on his experience compared to others on the team. While it‚Äôs better than the Google Pixel 7a in terms of benchmarks, even the Google Pixel 8 Pro, some Android Central testers find performance snappy while others found that apps constantly re-loaded when switching among them. Further, anything taxing will drain the battery faster than other phones in this class, like the OnePlus 12R.

Everyone loves taking photos with their phones. How do these two stack up?
The Nothing Phone 3a Pro has a 50MP main camera with a Sony sensor combined with a 50MP periscope, 8MP ultra-wide, and an impressive 50MP front camera for selfies. The cameras are arranged with a horizontally stacked lens configuration with 3x optical zoom and up to 60x ultra zoom. The large, circular camera island on the back will be polarizing, notes Sutrich, giving off a dramatic and industrial feel that not everyone will like.
The 50MP front camera supports 4K video recording as well, with AI-powered stabilization and night capture enhancement. There‚Äôs also a useful portrait mode as well as Ultra XDR that can capture 8 RAW frames at varying exposures and merge them for photos with more detail. The TrueLens Engine 3 works in the background to ensure pro-grade images, says the company.
There are also specific camera controls, including Quick record for instantly recording video, burst shot mode, a zoom indicator, and portrait effects. There are personal presets for camera settings so you can save your favorite ones, with images stored in the native Nothing photo gallery.
Sutrich says the cameras are good, a massive step up from the Nothing Phone 2a, particularly when it comes to zoom detail. ‚ÄúOverall,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúthese are great cameras and help build confidence in the brand and its capabilities.‚Äù

The Google Pixel 8a has some pretty impressive cameras, too. This includes a 64MP quad PD wide main camera, 13MP ultra-wide, and 13MP front. The main difference here is the much lower-resolution front camera, which won‚Äôt yield shots as nice as with the Nothing Phone 3a Pro. But you‚Äôll still get decent selfies.
Where Google excels is with its many popular photo editing and capture features, which appear in all the latest models, including the Google Pixel 8a. These include ones like Best Take, Audio Magic Eraser, Magic Editor, Night Sight, Real Tone, Photo Unblur, and Portrait Mode. There‚Äôs also super res zoom up to 8x.
Sutrich finds that while the Google Pixel 8a takes great photos, you‚Äôll get the same camera performance on the Google Pixel 7a. He finds that the Google Pixel 8a get exposure right in most cases, pulling out plenty of detail. You will get high contrast and color accurate imagery as well, which is a good thing. This phone, however, doesn‚Äôt live up to others in the line in terms of capturing objects in motion. So, if you‚Äôre looking to take lots of pics of kids or pets, you might want to consider another Pixel model.

It‚Äôs decision time. Between the Nothing Phone 3a Pro vs. Google Pixel 8a, which should you choose? Both are wonderful phones for affordable prices. With the Nothing Phone 3a Pro, you get a cool, stand-out look that will turn heads and have people asking you what phone that is, where you got it, and if it‚Äôs any good. By comparison, the Google Pixel 8a looks plainer in comparison, but it‚Äôs one of the best cheap Android phones you can buy right now, providing tremendous value for dollar.
While the Nothing Phone 3a Pro is newer, the Google Pixel 8a offers more than two times the length of software support, through 2031 whereas software support for the Nothing Phone 3a Pro will end by 2028. That might not sound like a big deal, but even if you don‚Äôt plan to keep either phone that long, the Google Pixel 8a will have better resale or trade-in value since it has so much life left in it.
The Google Pixel 8a is slightly more durable but the Nothing Phone 3a Pro is more powerful if you opt for the 12GB RAM version. The Essential Space in the Nothing Phone 3a Pro, while still a work in progress, makes use of AI in a practical way that will only get better over time as well.
Keep in mind that if you love the Nothing Phone 3a Pro but want to save even more, you can step down to the Nothing Phone 3a, which is more affordable with marginal differences, including slightly less capable cameras without a periscope option. Comparatively, the Google Pixel 7a is still a great budget phone with plenty of years of support still left, and the same camera performance as the Google Pixel 8a. So, if you‚Äôre on a super tight budget, these are both solid alternatives that you can find for even less.
Otherwise, if you want something totally different in terms of look and feel, you might appreciate the Nothing Phone 3a Pro. For something simpler and more traditional in design that still packs a punch in performance, the Google Pixel 8a won‚Äôt disappoint.


Make a statement
If you want to make a statement with a phone design that's unlike anything else, the Nothing Phone 3a Pro is the way to go. It boasts impressive specs, too, and the Essential Space organizer makes practical use of the built-in AI. Cool features like being able to take voice notes on the fly to organize your thoughts are appreciated.


Good 'ol reliable
Still with six years of software and security updates left, even though the Google Pixel 8a was introduced in 2024, it's still as relevant and worth getting today as it was then. Given the affordable price and the premium-like specs, it's worth considering if you want something more traditional looking.

The Great Rejection: What Happens When Consumer Frustration Boils Over
Retailers‚Äô latest headache‚Äîshock and awe of government tariffs and layoffs‚Äîis helping drive consumer sentiment into the red.
It would be hard to come up with a set of circumstances more likely to turn consumers sour on the U.S. economy than those which have developed just since New Year‚Äôs. Whether or not a recession is in the cards this year, the evidence is clear that frustration stalks the retail aisles.
In fact, it has been building for some time. As we noted here last August, there is something of a Great Rejection developing among shoppers, manifesting in such phenomena as the ‚Äúunderconsumption‚Äù trend that‚Äôs found traction with Gen Z and Millennial shoppers.
This year the rallying cries have continued, including ‚ÄúNo Buy 2025‚Äù and the Feb. 28 ‚ÄúEconomic Blackout‚Äù day called for by The People's Union USA, a movement advocating ‚Äúeconomic resistance, government accountability, and corporate reform.‚Äù
As last year drew to a close, it looked like the U.S. economy might still be on a glide path toward that much-invoked soft, no-recession landing. Inflation rates had been subsiding. In spite of widespread problems with unaffordable housing and car insurance, consumer spending had been holding up.
Two months later, the narrative has turned sharply dark. Tariff talk has become tariff reality. The headlines are full of dire predictions of huge disruptions in categories like grocery produce and automobiles from Mexico to building materials and oil from Canada.
You don‚Äôt have to be an economist to understand that such headlines affect spending behavior, especially when shoppers encounter inflation in bellwether basics like eggs, which recently hit an all-time high of $8 a dozen. Producers blame the spike on bird flu, but inflation is inflation. Such sticker shocks frustrate consumers and raise suspicions of price gouging.
All of this is beginning to take a toll. Last month, the widely-followed Conference Board‚Äôs consumer confidence index clocked the steepest decline since August 2021. Consumers‚Äô short-term outlook for the economy fell below the threshold that typically signals a recession is ahead. The Conference Board also found that the average 12-month inflation expectations surged to 6 per cent from 5.2 per cent.
Meanwhile, shoppers are continuing last year‚Äôs trend of trading down. The luxury market is sputtering and Walmart has been a beneficiary, attracting high-income shoppers with its value pricing on brands and growing reputation for quality private label goods.
Grocery shoppers have been trading down as well, with discount chain Aldi the leading beneficiary. The company has been booming, aggressively growing its fleet of stores to nearly 2,500, surpassing its nearest rival, Albertsons, with foot traffic surging in 2024‚Äôs fourth quarter by 12.3%, according to eMarketer.com.
If the economy feels wobbly to consumers, it feels even more out of kilter to veteran investors like Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett, whose investment decisions are widely followed for clues as to his thinking about where the stock market is going next. Buffett doesn‚Äôt predict, but he has been hoarding cash and, after five years of rising stock prices, recently explained, ‚ÄúOften, nothing looks compelling.‚Äù In other words, the stock market is overvalued.
It makes no sense, for example, that the market capitalization of Tesla is $825 billion while Toyota, which sold six times as many cars last year as Tesla, is $295 billion. Meanwhile, the housing market‚Äîthe repository of personal wealth for many Americans‚Äîhas remained hobbled by high prices and mortgage rates.
While The Great Rejection is not a real thing yet, it is an idea that consumers are warming to‚Äîspend less and save more‚Äîthat could be with us for some time to come."

A drop in inflation¬†announced this week did little to smooth over the markets as stocks sank early Thursday. That comes amid extended stock market uncertainty that has caused investments to rise and fall, sometimes within the same day. Combined with an inflation rate still almost a full percentage point above the Federal Reserve's target 2% goal and a pause in interest rate cuts that most expect to be extended when the bank meets next week, many savers may be exploring ways to protect their money right now.
And while no individual savings vehicle is immune from market conditions, there are still some smart ways in which savers can boost their returns. Even simply moving the funds from a traditional savings account, which has a rate of just 0.41% (or less than 50 cents for every hundred dollars deposited), can be advantageous. But which accounts are worth opening now, exactly? Below, we'll detail three to consider amid today's stock market uncertainty.
Start by seeing how much interest you could be earning with a top CD account here.
Multiple accounts and investments can help buffer today's stock market volatility. Here are three valuable ones worth exploring right now:
A long-term certificate of deposit (CD) account comes with a term longer than one year, giving your money extended protection. And it comes with interest rates in the 4% range, making it an easy way to earn a substantial return, depending on your initial deposit.¬†
Because CD interest rates are fixed, the rate you open your account with will remain the same for the full term. That means a 4.15% rate on a 2-year CD that's readily available now will be the same 4.15% rate in March 2026 and the same rate when the account matures in March 2027, making this a smart and effective way to combat today's market changes. Just be careful with how much you deposit, as you'll typically need to pay an early withdrawal penalty to regain access to your funds.
See what long-term CD rate you could secure here.
If you want to earn a similar rate to today's top CDs but don't want to have to forego access to your funds, a high-yield savings account can be worth exploring. Rates here are currently competitive with the top CDs, making this an alternative for those who need flexibility but still want to take advantage of today's elevated rate climate.¬†
That said, this account type doesn't come with the same concrete protections CDs do as high-yield savings account rates are variable and, thus, more responsive to market conditions. Still, they're generally a better option than minimal interest-earning traditional savings accounts.
Money market accounts also have elevated interest rates. Not only do they allow savers access to make deposits and withdrawals, but they also offer check-writing abilities that the aforementioned accounts do not. Still, rates here are also variable and can fluctuate based on market conditions. But if you want to earn a high rate, have the option to write checks, and don't mind rate fluctuations, this can be a good alternative to CDs with locked rates and high-yield savings accounts with minimal functionality.
Savers should always be exploring ways to protect and grow their money, especially in the volatile economic climate of recent years. Recent stock market uncertainty only underlines the importance of keeping your money in the right accounts. By considering CD, high-yield savings and money market accounts now ‚Äì and by opening one or multiple accounts ‚Äì savers can better protect their money and earn interest at the same time, giving them a much-needed buffer against today's market volatility and potential changes still to come.¬†

Retirees imagine their post-working lives relaxing in the shade on their comfortable porch. The view before them glistens with the fresh growth of green. The sweet light of the morning sun warms the dewy grass. They‚Äôre happy, at ease, and totally unfazed by economic headlines.
And they wouldn‚Äôt be wrong.
Unfortunately, far too many people‚Äîretired or not‚Äîseem to prefer to listen to the shouting heads on cable TV rather than their own common sense.
What a difference a few months (and a new president) make. A Deloitte report issued in late January predicted the 2025 GDP would come in at 2.4%. Even in the worst case, Deloitte felt the 2025 GDP would come in at no less than 1.6%. A recession requires a sustained period of negative GDP.
By the second week of March, Time Magazine was instructing its readers, ‚ÄúHow To Prepare For A Recession.‚Äù At the same time, with more of a blunt flair, Dow Jones‚Äô MarketWatch ran a story under the headline ‚Äú‚ÄòIs it finally time to freak out?‚Äô I‚Äôm in my 50s and worried about the $650K in my 401(k).‚Äù And if you needed elaboration, its subhead read, ‚Äú‚ÄòRecession is in the air. The stock market is in a downward spiral.‚Äô‚Äù
Who could blame you if you‚Äôre not frightened? Having not experienced one in over fifteen years, we‚Äôve built up recessions as something alien, something scary. And they can be, especially for those facing the challenges of retirement. A falling stock market only intensifies the anxiety.
‚ÄúThe greatest risk is if a retiree needs to sell investments at a loss to cover living expenses,‚Äù says Chad Gammon, owner of Custom Fit Financial in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. ‚ÄúThat can accelerate the depletion of the account and make it harder for income later in retirement.‚Äù
Known as the ‚Äúsequence of returns‚Äù risk, a falling market can be problematic if it occurs immediately at retirement when there‚Äôs less certainty what your actual retirement expenses will be. It doesn‚Äôt have to be problematic, of course, but that‚Äôs another story. For those even a few years into retirement, the potential downside of a recession is avoidable. It just takes a little foresight and self-discipline.
To understand this, you must first understand the history of bear markets. Recessions generally bring three things: 1) Fewer jobs (relax, you‚Äôre retired and out of that game); 2) Lower prices (you‚Äôre not going to complain about this, are you?); and, 3) Falling stock prices. OK, this last one gets you most worried as this brings on bear markets.
It‚Äôs important to understand this tried-and-true rule as it pertains to bear markets: Buy low, sell high. When the market is falling, you want to be buying. You don‚Äôt want to be selling. What makes you sell? The need for cash. What makes you need cash? The lack of incoming revenue. Well, you‚Äôre retired, so you probably have no incoming revenue beyond Social Security. Does that mean you must sell? Not necessarily. Not if you plan ahead. How do you do that? The answer is apparent: put away enough cash to survive until the market recovers.
Historical data for bear markets from 1957 to 2020 shows stocks typically recover within 19 months from the beginning of a recession. If you‚Äôre careful not to sell your stocks during these dips, you can better protect long-term retirement funds.
Here‚Äôs where many retirement investors slip up. They‚Äôve successfully set aside roughly two years of expenses. Now they want to know where to invest that horde of cash. Well, there‚Äôs the problem right there. They‚Äôre using the word ‚Äúinvest.‚Äù You don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúinvest‚Äù the money you‚Äôve set aside to pay your cost of living. You want to keep it safe. The answer to this real question is staring right at your face. It‚Äôs boring. It‚Äôs embarrassingly simple. And it‚Äôs not something you‚Äôd normally brag about while drinking coffee with your friends.
But it gets the job done. And everyone is going there.
‚ÄúMoney market funds are liquid, which is why they‚Äôre so important to retirees,‚Äù says Jordan Mangaliman, owner of Goldline Financial Services in Fullerton, California. ‚ÄúLiquidity in retirement can help protect a retiree from upending their financial security in retirement due to a financial emergency. Keeping up to two years‚Äô worth of expenses in a liquid account will help.‚Äù
If you have two years of expenses set aside in cash or money markets, are you worried about a recession? Think about it for a moment. You have no reason for panic selling. You can afford to wait for the inevitable rebound. Better yet, if you‚Äôre really thinking ahead, that modest grin on your face might just turn into a beaming smile.
Cash is king during retirement. It‚Äôs the safest way to ride out a recession unscathed. However, all but the wealthiest can afford to put all their retirement assets in cash and cash equivalents. You probably have a good many years, possibly decades, ahead of you in retirement. You still need to invest for the long term.
When stock prices fall and you have more than two years of expenses stashed away in cash, you have the prospect of turning the lemon of recession into the lemonade of future growth. Take some of that excess cash and put it to work for you. Remember what ‚Äúbuy low, sell high‚Äù means. That first part still applies in retirement. Take advantage of it. Your retirement will outlive any recession.
Moreover, if for some reason you had to take out a loan in the past year or so, a recession will likely offer an opportunity there, too. You can‚Äôt have a recession without an economic contraction. You also can‚Äôt have high interest rates during an economic contraction. Ergo, a recession usually ushers in a period of lower interest rates. This opens the door to refinancing those high-interest loans.
‚ÄúSometimes interest rates can fall during a recession lowering prices and the cost to borrow money,‚Äù says Lisa Greene-Lewis, tax expert with TurboTax in Ladera Ranch, California. ‚ÄúRecessions have not lasted long in the past, but your retirement savings will continue to grow and bounce back over time.‚Äù
If you‚Äôre already retired, recessions have nothing on you. You‚Äôve weathered storms of all kinds before. Congratulations! You‚Äôve come out ahead. Retirement is your victory lap. You no longer have to race against the job market, the economy, or even the Dow Jones.
Recessions bring lower prices, lower interest rates, and lower stock prices. No doubt the stocks in your retirement portfolio have given you solid gains over the last decade or so. There‚Äôs no problem banking some of those gains for a rainy day.
And should a recession rain down, relax and smile. Your nest egg‚Äôs tougher than any headline writer‚Äôs words."
