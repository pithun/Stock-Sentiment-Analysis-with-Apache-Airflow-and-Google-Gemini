0,2025-03-18,"Teslas are getting more expensive to insure thanks to the manufacturerâs sliding fortunes and reports of vandalism against the cars. There are few markets as pure, heartless, and single-minded as auto insurance. Itâs a machine run on actuarial tables and its calculations are telling insurers that theyâll probably have to pay out a damage claim if they cover a Tesla EV.
Tech billionaire and shadow president Elon Muskâs personal brand and fortune are linked to the cars. They are a visible reminder to people everyday that Musk is tearing through the federal government and destroying things with no oversight or regard for the human cost of the damage he inflicts. Itâs pissed people off and theyâre taking it out on Tesla.
Protestors are standing outside Tesla lots and waving anti-Musk signs. Celebrities and influencers are going viral with videos announcing the sell-off of their Musk-branded EV. People are throwing molotov cocktails at Teslas, spray painting them with swastikas, stealing their tires, and setting them on fire. During a Mardis Gras parade earlier this month, revelers repeatedly pelted a Cybertruck with beads, bottles, and other debris for three hours as it weaved its way through the parade route.
As the news, and insurance claims, pile up, insurers are driving up rates. âModel X or S Plaid drivers pay much higher average rates. Comparatively, average BMW i4 insurance costs are closer to that of a Model 3, at $3,792 per year for full coverage,â Shannon Martin, a Bankrate insurance analyst, told Newsweek. âTesla Model 3, Model Y, and Model X are the most expensive EV to insure as of February 2025.â
The cost to insure a Tesla Model 3 went up 30 percent last year. âThis is 25 percent higher in cost than the comparable Mercedes Benz A-Class,â Martin said. Itâs possible those numbers will continue to climb.
This has happened before. In 2023, Kia and Hyundai cheaped out when they manufactured some of their cars. As a result, some of their cars became easy to steal using a USB charging cable. It fueled a social media trend where people would steal the cars, joyride them, and post a video about it on TikTok. Insurance rates for the vehicles skyrocketed and owners filed class action lawsuits against the manufacturer.
Someone has also launched a website called âDOGEQUESTâ that allegedly shows the location of Tesla superchargers, dealerships, and Tesla owners. The website shows a map of the United States and users navigate it with a cursor shaped like a Molotov cocktail. Clicking individual cars gives you personal information about alleged Tesla owners. Some of the info included their name, addresses, phone numbers, emails, and employment information.
404 Media first reported on DOGEQUEST and was able to verify that some, but not all, of the information on it is accurate. âThe veracity of much of the data is unclear. 404 Media has verified that at least some of the people listed on the site do appear to be Tesla owners or supporters of the company or Musk, but it is not clear if every person listed is,â 404 Media said in its report. âThe addresses of several Tesla dealerships checked by 404 Media were correct. 404 Media found some plots on the map donât correspond correctly to their real-world locations.â
The website bills itself as a place that connects âlike-minded Tesla owners with one another, facilitating a vibrant community through shared contact information.â âIs DOGEQUEST a protest platform?â It asks itself. âIf you’re on the hunt for a Tesla to unleash your artistic flair with a spray can, just step outsideâno map needed! At DOGEQUEST, we believe in empowering creative expressions of protest that you can execute from the comfort of your own home. DOGEQUEST neither endorses nor condemns any actions.â
The site also claims that it will remove peopleâs personal information from the site if they send in a specific kind of request. âJust provide us with proof that you’ve sold your Teslaâ¦we only accept scanned documents in JPG and PNG formats.â

    Concerns over Trump's economic policies are clouding the rate outlook ahead of the spring homebuying season.
  
Today, the Federal Reserve voted to extend a pause on rate cuts for a second consecutive time this year. 
The bottom line is there's a lot of uncertainty in today's economy. Holding rates steady gives the central bank time to assess the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs, immigration policies and federal layoffs, as the markets face lingering inflation and heightened recession risks. 
The Fed's pause could keep mortgage interest rates — which are sensitive to fiscal policy and economic growth — higher for longer.  If you're in the market for a new home, average mortgage rates are projected to stay above 6% for a while. 
For better or worse, the Fed's relationship to home loan rates isn't direct or immediate. ""While the Fed certainly can influence mortgage rates, investors are the true movers,"" said Ali Wolf, chief economist at Zonda and New Home Source.
In the mortgage market, what the central bank says matters more than what it does. On Wednesday, investors and bond market traders eyed the Fed's updated Summary of Economic Projections, which outlines officials' expectations for interest rates and the broader economy. While the Fed still expects to make two 0.25% cuts in 2025 (the same forecast as December's), it also signaled concerns about the potentially adverse impacts of tariffs and weakening economic conditions. 
""Uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased,"" Fed chairman Jerome Powell said in a statement, noting the need to wait for more clarity before adjusting interest rates. 
Still, policymakers' ""wait and see"" approach isn't entirely to blame for an unaffordable housing market that remains plagued by limited inventory and steep home prices. 
The Fed sets and oversees US monetary policy under a dual mandate to maintain price stability and maximum employment. It does this largely by adjusting the federal funds rate, the rate at which banks borrow and lend their money. 
When the economy is in a slump or downturn, the Fed reduces interest rates to stimulate consumer spending and propel growth, as it did during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
In an inflationary environment, the Fed raises interest rates to slow economic growth. For example, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate by more than five percentage points between early 2022 and mid-2023 to combat inflation by curbing consumer borrowing and spending.
Though the Fed doesn't set mortgage rates, altering the price of credit causes a slow domino effect on mortgage rates and the broader housing market. Banks typically pass along the Fed's rate hikes or cuts to consumers through longer-term loans, including home loans. 
""Borrowing costs are important to prospective homebuyers,"" said Wolf. Cheaper interest rates make financing a home more appealing, opening up the market to first-time buyers as well as existing homeowners seeking to move. 
Because mortgage rates respond to several economic factors (see below), it's not uncommon for the federal funds rate and mortgage rates to move in different directions for some time. 
Read more: Why Labor Data Matters for Mortgage Rates and the Fed
In 2024, the Fed slashed interest rates three times for a total of one percentage point. At the start of 2025, it held them steady to ""carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook and the balance of risks."" The Trump administration's economic agenda and trade wars, expected to fuel price growth at a time when inflation remains sticky, continue to cloud the outlook for rate reductions. 
Though the Fed is projecting two cuts in 2025, that could still change with the next economic projections released in June. 
""If the Fed communicates any kind of shift in their economic projections or the future path of short-term rates, mortgage rates can fluctuate,"" said Wolf. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, investors are betting on the next rate cut in June or July. For the Fed to resume lowering interest rates, however, policymakers would need to see an ongoing decline in inflation or a rapid deterioration of the labor market.
Today's turbulent political and economic environment is already sparking concerns among investors that the US may be headed toward a recession. Over the last month, the stock market has plunged, mass layoffs have hit public and private sectors, households have cut spending and consumer confidence has slumped. 
Wolf said a dramatically cooling economy or a further souring of consumer, business, and investor sentiment could push mortgage rates lower. However, mortgage rate movement is always volatile, and the dips won't be drastic. Most housing market experts see average 30-year fixed rates staying between 6% and 7% throughout most of 2025.
Though mortgage rates typically fall during tough economic times, a recession won't lead to a more affordable or accessible housing market. If US families are struggling with the impact of higher prices and decreased purchasing power, not to mention a lack of stable employment, they'll be less likely to buy homes. 
""Consumers need to feel comfortable in their financial well-being to make the largest purchase of their lives,"" said Wolf. 
Mortgage rates move around for many of the same reasons home prices do: supply, demand, inflation and even the employment rate. 
Personal factors, such as a homebuyer's credit score, down payment and home loan amount, also determine one's individual mortgage rate. Different loan types and terms also have varying interest rates. 
Policy changes: When the Fed adjusts the federal funds rate, it affects many aspects of the economy, including mortgage rates. The federal funds rate affects how much it costs banks to borrow money, which in turn affects what banks charge consumers to make a profit.
Inflation: Generally, when inflation is high, mortgage rates tend to be high. Because inflation chips away at purchasing power, lenders set higher interest rates on loans to make up for that loss and ensure a profit.
Supply and demand: When demand for mortgages is high, lenders tend to raise interest rates. This is because they have only so much capital to lend out in the form of home loans. Conversely, when demand for mortgages is low, lenders tend to slash interest rates to attract borrowers.
Bond market activity: Mortgage lenders peg fixed interest rates, like fixed-rate mortgages, to bond rates. Mortgage bonds, also called mortgage-backed securities, are bundles of mortgages sold to investors and are closely tied to the 10-year Treasury. When bond interest rates are high, the bond has less value on the market where investors buy and sell securities, causing mortgage interest rates to go up.
Other key indicators: Employment patterns and other aspects of the economy that affect investor confidence and consumer spending and borrowing also influence mortgage rates. For instance, a strong jobs report and a robust economy could indicate greater demand for housing, which can put upward pressure on mortgage rates. When the economy slows and unemployment is high, mortgage rates tend to be lower.

Even though timing is everything in the mortgage market, you can't control what the Fed does. ""Forecasting interest rates is nearly impossible in today's market,"" said Wolf. 
Regardless of the economy, the most important thing when shopping for a mortgage is to make sure you can comfortably afford your monthly payments. "

Tesla's stock is tanking over fears of slowing sales, increasing competition, and a CEO who's busy spending his time in Washington, DC. So far, 2025 looks like the electric vehicle company's annus horribilis.

        You wouldn't know it from talking to employees.
    

        The plummeting stock performance is ""only concerning if you're a short-term investor,"" one Tesla worker in the company's sales department said. ""It feels like we're in a storm right now, but I'm personally very confident in the company.""
    

        Business Insider spoke with 10 Tesla employees across different roles and locations in recent days. All but one — a worker who left this year — are still with the company, and nine own Tesla stock. They spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to avoid professional reprisal. The conversations shed light on how some inside the company are weathering the recent abysmal stock performance.
    

        The general sentiment? Shrug.


        Several pointed to the fact that the company's stock is up about 30% from this time last year. Over the past five years, it has spiked over 800%.
    

        Four workers said they actively avoid looking at the share price. ""If you're looking every day, you're going to drive yourself crazy,"" one Texas employee said. There are many variables that could impact its market performance, the employee added — namely the dealings of CEO Elon Musk — that are out of employees' control.
    

        In an informal company forum where some employees discuss the stock performance, the attitude appears to be similar. Workers haven't been posting anything out of the ordinary, five employees said; the channel, which has a few thousand users, is often used to share tweets and news stories about Tesla.
    

        One worker in Nevada said the internal atmosphere was far from ""depressing"" or ""alarming.""
    

        A spokesperson for Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment.
    

        Historically, stock grants have played a large role in Tesla compensation, and some workers have seen it as one of the company's most attractive features. Musk said in 2023 that the company has made people working Tesla's factory line millionaires.
    

        ""There's definitely some people who want to work at Tesla because they think they'll get rich fast on the stock, but those people don't last long,"" the former worker said.
    

        Two other workers said the stock's volatility had nudged them toward long-term cash options, which allow employees to receive cash awards that are typically paid out over a period of four years.
    

        In general, Tesla offers lower base salaries than its tech and automotive peers but provides the opportunity for substantial stock grants, according to a 2021 internal pay sheet.
    

        In 2024, Tesla granted workers an estimated $2.69 billion in restricted stock units and about $3.5 billion in stock options, according to its annual report, which breaks down the number of RSUs and options granted as well as the average value.
    

        Two workers said they felt Tesla's share price was the least of workers' concerns. The carmaker has faced an onslaught of protests over Musk's association with Donald Trump and the White House DOGE office.
    

        In February, The New York Times reported that a Tesla manager, Jared Ottmann, had been terminated after he criticized one of Musk's social media posts that referenced Nazi leaders.
    

        ""How often do you think about your CEO?"" asked one engineer, who said they'd grown frustrated with questions about Musk. ""Do you hold yourself personally responsible for their behavior?""
    

        Still, eight workers said they felt generally optimistic about the future of the company.
    

        ""It's an old story,"" one manager said. ""Elon has always been in this controversial space, but if the product is good enough people are going to buy it anyway.""

If you’re in the market for a new car, the decision just got more difficult to fit into your budget. Or at least, more urgent, especially if you have your heart set on one of the approximately 30 car models, per Cars.com, that face potential price hikes thanks to President Donald Trump’s planned 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico.
Consider This: I’m a Car Expert: These 8 Used Cars Will Be a Great Deal in 2025
Find Out: 4 Easiest Frugal Living Tips Perfect for Beginners in 2025
The tariffs were supposed to go into effect at the beginning of March. However, after meeting with Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum, Trump paused the tariffs for a month. They are now set to take effect on April 2, 2025, CBS News reported.
Because tariffs are paid by the importer — the American business — not the country exporting the item, they have the potential to drive up the price of goods being imported. In this case, it would be any car — or car using a significant amount of parts — made in Mexico or Canada. And while there is no way to predict how much of the 25% tariff will be passed onto American consumers by American auto dealers, most experts say car prices will increase.
CBS News projected the price increases to be $6,200 on a small car, $8,000 on pickups, $9,000 on full-size SUVs and $12,200 or more on electric crossover vehicles.
Taking all that into consideration, here are four cars you might want to buy before next month, including their model’s current starting MSRP and their potential MSRP if the full 25% tariff were added into the vehicle’s price.
Current Starting MSRP: $30,100
Potential MSRP With a 25% Tariff: $37,625
Chosen by Car and Driver as 2025’s best compact SUV, if the price jumps significantly in a month, picking up this favorite will look like buying Apple stock in the 90s. That’s especially true when you consider that, according to CarEdge, the Honda CR-V holds its resale value well.
Be Aware: Mechanics Explain Why You Should Never Buy These 6 Popular Car Brands
Current Starting MSRP: $31,590
Potential MSRP with a 25% Tariff: $39,488
Here is a popular truck that holds its resale value well — CarEdge wrote, “The Toyota Tacoma mid-size pick-up is perhaps the best vehicle on the road for holding its value.”
Their data indicates that the model loses only 28% of its value over five years. That makes those coming tariffs look like a current buying opportunity.
Current Starting MSRP: $24,250
Potential MSRP with a 25% Tariff: $30,313
Another Car and Driver top pick, this time as No. 1 in best compact cars, the Honda Civic has long been known as a solid choice that holds its value.
For instance, according to Kelly Blue Book, the 2022 Civic is in the top 10% for depreciation among all sedans, with a depreciation of only $4,776 over the past three years. That’s over a thousand dollars less than the potential $6,063 25% tariff on the 2025 base model.
Current Starting MSRP: $24,150
Potential MSRP with a 25% Tariff: $30,188
While Car and Driver ranks the Mazda3 fourth in best compact cars, U.S. News & World Report has the model as No. 1 in the category. Either way, the Mazda3 gets high marks for its nice interior, zippy engine and cool styling. Its low entry price also makes it an affordable car — for now, anyway.

7,2025-03-18,"Chinese automaker BYD continues to leave Tesla in the dust. The company introduced a new battery system on Monday that it claims can charge an electric vehicle in just five minutes, about the same time it takes to refuel a combustion car. The feat has long been a goal of the industry, which is still trying to overcome thorny hurdles around charging that have held potential buyers back.
The company specifically claims it can provide 249 miles of range in 5 minutes in its new Han L sedan. That compares to Tesla’s best charging rate, which can add 170 miles of range in 15 minutes at one of its high-voltage Superchargers. Elon Musk years ago bet big on an in-house battery to provide extended range to his company’s vehicles, but seemingly found battery development is harder than expected, as the 4860 battery has not lived up to expectations.
BYDâs stock rose on the news to reach a market value of roughly $158 billion. It is up approximately 58% so far this year.
There has been some concern raised that fast charging such as that from BYD could shorten the overall lifespan of an EV battery, but there is little evidence thus far to support that idea.
The CEO of major Chinese battery maker CATL last year said Musk “doesn’t know how to make a battery” in an interview with Reuters.
BYD, now the leading EV maker in China, was founded in 1995 as a battery manufacturing company, and only later entered the automotive market as it saw the future of cars would be as computers on wheels. It also assembles iPads for Apple. The company makes EVs at a range of prices, with its most affordable Seagull coming in at a starting price of just $9,700. It has been expanding across the world into markets like Europe and South America, building China’s soft power by creating local jobs and proving it can be successful outside the domestic Chinese market.
This all comes as Musk looks to handicap U.S. automotive companies by getting rid of subsidies that were helping the industry transition. Critics of China have complained that it uses subsidies to flood foreign markets with cheap products, but BYD is profitable on EVs now, and U.S. automakers could do the same if they had more time to reach scale. America was once a leader in automotive globally, but has decided to cede that position to China in favor of AI and crypto.
The transition to EVs has come with more growing pains than many in the industry expected, as charging infrastructure has been slow to expand and available chargers are frequently broken or slow. The existing infrastructure around gas-powered vehicles was developed over decades, however, and it makes sense it would similarly take time for EVs to reach maturity. Fast-charging capabilities could placate drivers who do not want to sit at chargers for a long time.
Besides leapfrogging Tesla on price and battery performance, BYD also recently announced it will be adding advanced self-driving features to all of its vehicles. Reviewers have lauded BYDâs system for its performance.
It should all serve as a reminder that Tesla’s current valuation does not make a lot of sense. Sales have been cratering globally, the company sells fewer vehicles than BMW at lower profit margins, its vehicle lineup is dated, and full autonomy is years late. But Musk has pivoted to self-driving robocabs and robotics to keep the valuation afloat. Tesla stock has fallen 40% since the start of 2025 in part over intense backlash to Muskâs close involvement in the Trump administration. On Tuesday, Ross Gerber, one of Tesla’s most loyal investors called for Musk to step down from his position as CEO at the company.
Perhaps if he was not spending all his time in Washington, Musk would have more time for Tesla, once the leader in electric vehicles but now second-tier compared to BYD. The power and proximity to President Trump is more valuable to him, it seems. It is certainly sad to think how much further ahead Tesla would be today if it had a full-time CEO not making the brand toxic.

If you spend a significant amount of time online, particularly on Elon Musk's X, you may have come across some jaw-dropping information about American politicians' wealth.

        There's a good chance it's not true.
    

        Whether it's falsely inflated salaries, charges of illicit sources of income, or estimated net worths seemingly pulled out of thin air, false information about the personal wealth of American leaders is seemingly all over the place online.
    

        The claims are sometimes so outrageous that lawmakers feel compelled to respond, as Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Jasmine Crockett of Texas have.
    




        These people either have no relationship with the truth or really are dumber than bricks or both I know one thing is true. They are intimidated otherwise they wouldnt waste their time trying to come up with outlandish stories. PLEASE POST the tax assessor links to my lavish https://t.co/mYCXggXbYW


        — Jasmine Crockett (@JasmineForUS) February 14, 2025


        Some of this false information has been promoted by Musk himself, who recently expressed interest in raising the salaries of members of Congress — based on the notion that they're enriching themselves by steering money toward non-governmental organizations in which they're involved.
    

        The DOGE leader recently reshared a post making false or unverified claims about various top lawmakers, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, former Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.
    

        ""It's not like these politicians started companies or were NBA All-Stars, so where did they get all the money?"" Musk wrote. ""Does anyone know?""
    

        Occasionally, members of Congress do engage in outright corruption, with the most recent example being Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey.
    

        But by and large, members of Congress don't have a ton of avenues to enrich themselves, thanks to ethics rules.
    

        Under ethics rules, members of the House and Senate are generally barred from earning more than roughly $30,000 in outside income from other jobs.
    

        Some make use of that: Marco Rubio, now the Secretary of State, earned more than $20,000 a year teaching college courses when he was a senator, disclosures show. Many do not.
    

        But some lawmakers do manage to find a way to make extra money while serving — one that's perfectly legal and not subject to the outside income limit: book deals.
    

        This is especially true in the Senate, where lawmakers are more well-known, and thus more likely to sell lots of books.
    

        Take Warren as an example. In 2023, she made more than $36,200 from book royalties. The year before, she made even more — over $443,000.
    

        The Massachusetts senator is an especially prolific author, drawing royalties from a combination of political memoirs she's written since becoming a politician. The books include ""The Two-Income Trap,"" which she wrote as a professor, and even textbooks that she helped write in the 1980s.
    

        In 2023, eight senators made more than $100,000 from book agreements. That includes Democrats like Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia and Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with Republicans like Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri.
    

        Book proceeds are by far the most common way for lawmakers to generate significant amounts of income while in office.
    

        Sometimes, writing books can allow lawmakers to dramatically improve their financial situations. Rubio, for example, has said that writing a book allowed him to pay off his student loans.
    

        Becoming landlords is another way for property-owning members of Congress to make money. 
    

        For lawmakers who are already independently wealthy, there's also a way to pad that: stock ownership. That's more controversial, given that lawmakers may have access to non-public information.
    

        Business Insider's ""Conflicted Congress"" project found in 2021 that many members of Congress fail to report their trades in a timely fashion, and that conflicts of interest abound.
    

        But making money from the stock market isn't entirely straightforward either: The market rises and falls, and even lawmakers can make bad bets.
    

        If you see a post stating that a rank-and-file member of Congress has an annual salary other than $174,000, there's a good chance that it's fake.
    

        That's the salary that virtually all members of Congress have been paid since 2009 — lawmakers have blocked any increase every single year since then.
    

        Congressional leaders make a bit more than that. The speaker of the House — currently Rep. Mike Johnson — makes $223,500 a year. Every other top party leader makes $193,400.
    

        If you come across a post claiming a lawmaker makes an exorbitant amount of money, it's probably worth fact-checking.
    

        The good news is that anyone can do it themselves.
    

        Every year, members of the House and Senate file reports disclosing their assets, sources of income, and debts. The same is true of Trump administration nominees and candidates running for federal offices.
    

        The Senate maintains an online portal for searching this information, as does the House. For the executive branch, there's a portal managed by the US Office of Government Ethics.
    

        So is Chuck Schumer worth $75 million, and Warren $76 million, as the post that Musk reshared alleges?
    

        No.
    

        According to 2023 disclosures, Schumer is worth roughly $2.3 million, while Warren — who's also publicly released her tax returns — is worth a little more than $9 million.

    If you're worried about keeping your money safe, there are much better places for it.
  
Is your money keeping you up at night? If you're like some people, it might be because there's a mountain of cash under your mattress. According to a new study (PDF) by financial management app company Piere, 6% of Americans keep cash stashed beneath mattresses, beds and pillows. Others hide money under floorboards, in secret compartments and other places around the house.
Why would anyone do this? Yuval Shuminer, co-founder and CEO of Piere, thinks it may be because they're worried about everything they're reading on the news.
""With so much uncertainty in the economy, it's no surprise that people are looking for ways to keep their money close at hand,"" Shuminer said. ""The resurgence in mattress stuffing isn't some whimsical trend. It's a sign that many Americans feel uneasy about the financial system and are searching for something they can trust.""
With wild swings in the stock market due to constantly changing tariffs and empty egg shelves at the grocery market, it's easy to understand why people feel jittery about their financial futures. If you're one of them, you're better off putting your money elsewhere. Read on to learn about the dangers of keeping cash at home -- and what you should do with it instead.

If you don't find any dollar bills under your neighbor's mattress, keep looking. There's a decent chance they might keep it somewhere else in the house. (Disclaimer: Don't actually dig through your neighbor's house for cash. That would be illegal and awkward.)
Here's a rundown of the various places around the house where Americans are stashing some of their dollar bills, according to Piere's study of 1,500 respondents:
It's not just standard cash, either. Piere's research revealed that Americans also keep their wealth at home in the form of valuables such as precious gems, silver or gold bars, heirlooms and traveler's checks.
The average respondent said they keep $544 in valuables, cash or both at home. And it's more common than you may think: Only 5% of respondents said they don't keep any money around the house.
While that envelope of hundreds in your sock drawer might feel like a fallback to protect you if the world ends, there are some major downsides to keeping a chunk of cash at home.
No matter how much peace of mind you may get from keeping cash at home, you should find a new place for it. So, take that money out from under your pillow, put your pillowcase in the washing machine (money is dirty) and consider putting your cash in these places instead.
In addition to growth potential, they provide federal deposit insurance to keep your money safe in case of a bank failure.
The best high-yield savings accounts pay up to a 5% annual percentage yield right now. A $544 deposit would earn $27.20 over a year at that rate. And the longer you keep your money in the account, the faster it grows thanks to compound interest.
Your money will still be accessible when you need it. Big banks offer a lot of ATM locations, and plenty of online banks partner with large ATM networks. This makes a high-yield savings account ideal for money you may need at any time, such as an emergency fund.
CDs also offer competitive rates. Today's best CDs earn up to 4.65% APY. At that rate, $544 would earn $12.50 on a six-month CD, $25.30 on a one-year CD and $79.47 on a three-year CD (there are a range of other terms to choose from, too).
Unlike savings accounts, whose rates can change without notice, CDs offer a fixed rate if you keep your cash in the account for the entire term. That means you'll need to be comfortable leaving your money alone for a period. If you access it before the CD matures, you may face an early withdrawal penalty.
A money market account is a hybrid between a savings and a checking account. It gives you flexible access to your funds thanks to debit cards, check-writing privileges or both, and you'll also enjoy the benefit of earning a decent chunk of interest.
The best money market accounts currently pay upward of 4.4% APY. At that rate, a $544 deposit could earn $23.94 over a year.
Keeping your cash near might make you feel more comfortable, especially when the economy is shaky. But hoarding piles of bills won't do you much good -- and it could put your money at risk. Put it in one of the places above, and you can rest easy knowing it's safe and growing."
10,2025-03-18,"There are all kinds of expensive beauty treatments on the market — various creams, zappy lasers, and fine mists of heavily-refined chemicals. For [Ruth Amos], a $78,000 LED bed had caught her eye, and she wondered if she could recreate the same functionality on the cheap.
The concept behind [Ruth]’s build is simple enough. Rather than buy a crazy-expensive off-the-shelf beauty product, she decided to just buy equivalent functional components: a bunch of cheap red LEDs. Then, all she had to do was build these into a facemask and loungewear set to get the same supposed skin improving benefits at much lower cost.
[Ruth] started her build with a welding mask, inside which she fitted red LED strips of the correct wavelength for beneficial skin effects. She then did the same with an over-sized tracksuit, lacing it with an array of LED strips to cover as much of the body as possible. While it’s unlikely she was able to achieve the same sort of total body coverage as a full-body red light bed, nor was it particularly comfortable—her design cost a lot less—on the order of $100 or so.
Of course, you might question the light therapy itself. We’re not qualified to say whether or not red LEDs will give you better skin, but it’s not the first time we’ve seen a DIY attempt at light therapy.

Well, looks like the times of ripping off esoteric people are gone. Now its the time to build some weird stuff and call it “beauty therapy”.
Mark my words.
Not long and someone will build a suit filled with piezo buzzers and call it “acoustic frequency hormonizer” and state it betters your skin by harmonizes your resonances or some BS.
You mean like the Schumann resonance gadgets on aliexpress?
Power Balance all over again, except they didn’t even need piezo buzzers!
Shh, stop giving them ideas. ;)
This is however something supported by scientific research.
Don’t expose your ignorance.
You mean like the in-ear LEDs?
It looks like a very solid way to generate body hair in a statistically significant manner. https://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2025/02/24/red-light-therapy-skin-hair-medical-clinics/
Clearly it has very specific uses (like focusing chemo on cancer cells etc.) but buying consumer grade “Red LED strips” and expecting them to have “the correct wavelength” sounds like a good way to hurt your skin. I am pretty sure the medical apparatus producers do not supply their LEDs from IKEA.
My uncle thinks he can heal people by parping his didgeridoo at them. If he could buy a set of tubes that seem to automatically parp at him in a vaguely Australian way I’m sure he’d buy it.
I know a lot of people who think that SSRIs help them even though the mechanism has been disproven several times over the past thirty years
“Disproven” is subjective. Vaccines have been disproven several times through the years.
Of course they have been proven many, many more times than disproven, which is why the consensus is that vaccines and SSRIs work.
It’s not fringe studies that report the lack of causal mechanism for SSRIs, it’s the mainstream stuff.  The current prevailing explanation is that we do not know how they work, but that we coincidentally stumbled upon a pharmaceutical that improves outcomes beyond the placebo effect through a thus-far unknown mechanism instead of the proposed “chemical imbalance” mechanism which is now widely considered to be false (and has been for decades).
Seems a little farfetched to me, but I suppose it is technically within the realm of possibility.
Also nobody mentioned vaccines one way or the other; that seems like a non-sequitur meant to evoke a conditioned emotional response.
Why don’t people realize that daylight includes light in the red spectrum?
You aren’t applying logic and are contradicting yourself. You basically mock people who think they help but then in another comment, “stumbled upon a pharmaceutical that improves outcomes beyond the placebo effect”, so you admit it does work but we just don’t know how. Not working and not knowing how they work are not the same thing.
If you look into the human body and conditions you will quickly find that there is much we don’t know about what causes or how to treat conditions, for a lot of medications and treatments we don’t know how they work or don’t fully understand how they work. Why do you think it often involves trying various types of medication until you find one that works? Because they work differently and we don’t actually know what the exact problem is or which type of treatment will work for your specific problem. There is a reason that we need large scale human trials to see how effective medications are, it is not deterministic or easily predictable like a lot of other science and engineering fields.
It would be better to know how everything works but the most important thing is that it works. If it works for these people you know then what is wrong with that? Just because a few studies disproved how it works doesn’t mean it doesn’t work.
I don’t actually think they stumbled onto a totally different cure for the same disease that isn’t the one they set out to create, I think they already had such a large market by that time that they p-hacked some studies to continue propping up snake oil that doesn’t work and often harms people. Like I said, it is technically within the realm of possibility, but it’s extremely dubious.
It’s not the first time such a thing would have happened. It’s not the V-word, but people seem to take it as utter heresy that this could occur–it absolutely does. It’s difficult to reign in market forces on a timescale of decades, and even the best science takes some time to counter such forces.
Use of these therapies among young women is now at 64%. Almost two-thirds. That’s going to be a tough sell for many reasons. Try and tell me how there isn’t fraud involved somewhere in this pipeline.
I think it’s justified to question the efficacy and rationality of prescribing a class of pharmaceuticals described as “antidepressants” which, counterintuitively, appear to increase the rates of suicide. We clearly don’t understand the true effects of SSRI’s and their initially claimed mechanism of action has been demonstrated to be incorrect. Substantial financial incentives exist to field new study which can justify continued mass use of SSRI’s. And the positive efficacy results they’re getting are so small, I begin to question if they truly exist at all because it’s easy to bias study results a little bit one way with how you collect and aggregate the data. Seems like if SSRI’s worked the data would show much higher levels of efficacy instead of results that are barely better than placebo. Just saying.
A quick google search shows a digital didgeridoo project.
Apparently involves a blue tooth microphone and an old computer.
Is basically a digital delay that keeps repeating input noise into the ‘instrument’.
Would make good RP nano project, or you could make one out of music effects.
Sounds incredibly annoying.
Even more than just a hippie and an instrument.
Not sure if you should point him at the project.
Even worse idea:
Hide the BT microphone in the toilet, leave jar of kimchi in fridge.
Sound activated, so the didgeridoo keeps repeating the last ‘noise sequence’ (‘brap brap grunt splash, ‘gods angry fist’ splash…Mom’s voice…ahhh, Vindaloo’).
Good idea:
Make pop on didgeridoo/bong conversion base.
Owners of didgeridoos always also own bongs.
I think it’s a rule. Cops can get search warrant for bong based on presence of didgeridoo…
Also note:
You can carry any bong anywhere by putting a lampshade on it.
Or by saying ‘it’s a didgeridoo’.
I digress.
Crop was nice this year.
argone accumulator anyone?  I got asked to make one for someone once…

At least this is mostly harmless and the originals are only separating rich idiots from their money.
But, it’s reminiscent of the woo woo gadgets which are sold with implied claims of being alzheimers, cancer, whichever nasty life limiting disease they care to name treatments and allegedly work by shining lights of different colours in various patterns/frequencies onto bits of the body.
I wish the slime who prey on the desperate were afflicted with the disease they’re claiming to cure with their BS.
Here in Czech republic i saw public health insurance to cover magnet therapy. So it’s an incentive for a clinics to sing you up for magnet therapy instead of actual cure, because cost for them is zero and insurance copany will pay them anyway.
sounds like Electronic Snake oil to me.
Easy to say ‘mostly harmless’ or that a different oddity is pure snake oil, but really you have to research even pretty stupid seeming things before you can make that claim. Random seeming bit of tree bark is toxic to the point you likely die with small exposure, while similarly random seeming bit of bark might be comparable to Aspirin, or rather good for you in some way at a very low concentration etc.
The core of the concept here is actually pretty simple to prove sound – as does your skin react to exposure to different wavelengths in different ways? The answer to which is really darn obvious and easy to see now at least for the lighter coloured skintones that tan/burn in a very visible way. Which thanks to research you can prove is a reaction to the UV end of the spectrum. So the concept that exposure to a controlled amount of a very specific X-ray, IR, Radio frequency, or microwaves might actually prove beneficial (at least to your appearance) trigger some other mechanism wouldn’t be a surprise.
Which is not to say I actually believe this is genuine, as I’ve not read the papers, seen the peer reviews or done any research on it myself (and I personally really don’t care enough on this topic to do so). But it isn’t impossible, at least till proven otherwise keep an open mind.
The reason why “traditional” or folk medicine works is because diseases and ailments tend to heal themselves anyways regardless of the treatment – leaving people with the observation that the last treatment worked.
Naive folk science is often misleading, and you can end up treating the toxic tree bark the same as the medicinal tree bark. Moreover, the fact that the toxic tree bark kills you is an indication of how potent it is, and therefore using smaller non-lethal amounts will surely be a very potent remedy. That’s how we ended up with mercury as medicine in the past, or drinking colloidal silver even if it turns your skin blue.
It’s a form of the streetlight fallacy, where people look for solutions in places where they observe a significant difference, even if the difference has nothing to do with the problem they’re facing. In the original story, the drunkard was looking for his lost keys under the street lamp, not because they were necessarily lost there, but because there was enough light to see.
Similarly, you may reason that it’s easy to see that certain frequencies of light have an effect on human skin – but that doesn’t mean other wavelengths, especially long wavelengths that are actually not absorbed by the skin, should do anything at all. The core of the concept isn’t “sound” – it’s just like the drunkard’s search: you can’t expect to find the lost keys just anywhere. Why should they be here instead of there?
More to the point, UV light may cure (and cause) skin cancer as a form of radiation therapy, but that may have nothing to do with e.g. a rash caused by a virus or cell changes due to aging, or poor diet, or whatever. What does it mean to make your skin prettier or healthier? What exactly are you trying to do?
Without even knowing what the problem is you’re trying to solve, or not having defined it in the first place, you’re twice removed from any soundness of reasoning. A difference by one action doesn’t inherently suggest a difference by a related but different action (one color of light vs. another), and without knowing what the difference should be, you can’t evaluate whether you’ve achieved it.
You might stumble upon a new mechanism of action, but that has nothing to do with your reasoning of the matter  – you just got lucky and then moved the goalposts to say that the effect you found was the effect you were looking for. That’s like the drunkard accidentally finding someone else’s keys, and by sheer coincidence ending up at the door they fit in, declaring “I’m home!”.
The core concept here is simply that the skin or your body in general reacts to certain wavelengths differently, which is categorically proved. I agree there is no reason every wavelength picked arbitrarily will do anything beneficial, and in the case of beauty products actually defining beneficial… But still the very nucleus of the concept that a wavelength has some effect is proven which makes this very very plausible that other wavelengths will do something.
I also agree many traditional remedies are not genuinely useful, but equally many have been proven valid  – till you actually study them you can’t know if this one is just a placebo, harmless and its just the body repairing itself, or perhaps useful but actually in an entirely different way to the supposed mechanism etc etc. So you can’t just ignore an idea as snake oil simply because the mechanism it works by isn’t obvious to you! Until it has been studied sufficiently the only thing you have to judge by is the basic principles in play, which when it comes to biology is often barely understood complex chemistry…
There is a lot of nonsense out there but that just means we need more research. A lot of modern medicine can probably be traced back to “traditional” remedies.

  But still the very nucleus of the concept that a wavelength has some effect is proven which makes this very very plausible that other wavelengths will do something.

That’s exactly the error in reasoning, and why people believe bunk science and charlatans. You’re fixating on the positive effect and ignoring the full evidence: there is light that does something, and there is light that does not. There’s actually more evidence for a lack of effect than there is for effect.
But ultimately it doesn’t confirm or deny the case – observing one wavelength of light does not in and of itself make it any more or less plausible that another wavelength would do anything, especially when you don’t know what “anything” should be.
In order to use the evidence, you would need to formulate a hypothesis about why the effect happens or doesn’t happen. Without that, you’re jumping to conclusions.

  also agree many traditional remedies are not genuinely useful, but equally many have been proven valid

Where does the claim of “equally many” come from? Have you listed all of them?

  So you can’t just ignore an idea as snake oil simply because the mechanism it works by isn’t obvious to you!

That’s a different argument. We’re talking about how do you evaluate whether it is. Lending credibility to claims by faulty reasoning is the hallmark of snake-oil and bunk science.
Mind: the effect may be real, but the reasoning makes it bunk.
After all, snake-oil salesmen of old commonly added cocaine in their tonics, which indeed makes you feel better almost regardless of the ailment. The tonic works – just not how you think it does, or how it was sold to you.
ChatGPT: “There are several scientific studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of red light therapy for skin care. For instance, a study published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology found that low-level red and infrared light therapy can significantly increase the production of collagen, elastin, and hyaluronic acid in skin cells. This suggests potential benefits such as enhanced skin texture, reduced wrinkles, and improved skin elasticity​
Another study outlined in BMJ Open is focused on comparing the effects of red and amber LED light on facial aging. This research is designed as a randomized controlled trial and aims to specifically evaluate the reduction in the volume of periocular wrinkles, highlighting the potential rejuvenation effects of red light therapy on the skin​
These studies indicate that red light therapy can be a beneficial treatment for improving skin health and appearance, supporting its use in clinical and cosmetic dermatology.”

IMHO this is a good example of chatgpt providing text without serious value towards answering the question at hand, while suggesting otherwise in the answer.
The first publication is funded by johnson & johnson and describes research performed on donor cells from plastic surgery (i.e. left over tissue from the operating theatre) cultivated in the lab. How well results from this context can translate to the real world is unclear.
The second publication merely describes a protocol for an intended study. It does not indicate nor support anything as chatgpt claims.
Neither of the example publications “demonstrate the effectiveness of red light therapy for skin care”.

Thanks! Thanks for pasting the output of a machine known to lie and hallucinate! You’ve definitely added to the conversation here!
Tell me in what part did it lie? Did you read the papers?
Did you verify that the claims made by ChatGPT are supported by the papers?
Red light therapy is actually well studied and has demonstrable effects on skin and deeper tissue. It has regenerative effects. It improves scars and speeds up wound recovery (from ulcers for example. It is actually used medically. Look up the medical research about it, it’s real.
Okay but what does the red light actually do? I watched the entire video, and I still don’t know this.
Read scientific papers I linked above.
Thanks for your effort
I am very interested in the effect of light on human body (and mind). Tried to diy a lucid dreaming mask but it never went anywhere
I recently met some people who work in optogenetics, which is the use of light to selectively activate neurons or other tissue types.  Much more invasive than a light mask, but very cool nonetheless.
You mean the scientific papers ChatGPT linked above.
They are still scientific papers with a research. Now show yours.
Show my what? I’m not arguing the validity of the studies. I’m talking about how ChatGPT contributes to a dumbing-down of interaction on the internet.
Jesus, give it up.  If the papers came up in a Google search, would you be so stubbornly dug in over how they were found?
The papers are not the issue here. I honestly don’t care whether they support this therapy or not. What I care about is whether ChatGPT can be trusted to accurately summarise them, and whether they support the claims ChatGPT is making. My own experience and countless examples have shown that ChatGPT lies and hallucinates. It makes stuff up that isn’t in the citation it gives. It is worse than useless – it is actively harmful.
Helena, I just realized…
ChatGPT is a a genius act of poisoning the data well, on VCs dime.
My opinions about it are completely revised now.
ChatGPT is worth a million+:
‘For sale 20kg of lithium deuteride. Will trade for large bioreactor and crop dusting aircraft. Ask for Osama.’ ads on Topeka Craigslist.
I bet ChatGPT has the NSA chasing shadows, even more then normal.
I can’t speak to skin treatments, but for treatment of TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury) & Concussions (slightly less traumatic brain injury) I was surprised with how effective this type of therapy can be.
My GF had a concussion last summer, and after ~5-6 months of slow recovery, even with extensive cognitive rest, we started looking for other options.  Red Light Therapy was mentioned a few times, and I was pretty skeptical, but I figured I could do a little research and it turns out that it’s actually quite effective at neurological rehab!  I was pretty surprised, honestly – it’s just shining lights at someone’s head, right?
Actually – using specific wavelengths in the low-infrared/red spectrum, the energy penetrates a few cm into the skull and causes increased bloodflow to those areas – apparently?  I found a few decent peer reviewed studies that didn’t really explain the entire mechanism, but showed significant improvement, and for my GF it’s been night/day.  She’s able to hold conversations again, sleep, has her short term memory back – basically she can function after treatments.  She’s done ~2 months of biweekly treatments, and they’re starting to ramp her down – but this was a huge step forward in recovery for her.

The radiation intensity mentioned in that paper (22 mW/cm^2) is about the same as if you took a walk in sunshine (100 mW/cm^2 over the whole spectrum, roughly 20-25 mW/cm^2 in the “red”, depending on what you call “red”).
Note the postulated mechanism is absorption by cytochrome-c oxidase, part of the metabolic process that produces ATP, the internal “fuel” in cells.  It has an absorption peak at 600 nm, what most people would call the orange end of red.
Cerebral blood flow is regulated by nitric oxide (NO), in turn modulated by local carbon dioxide concentration.  You can double the blood flow in your brain just by holding your breath for a minute.  It also changes with postural changes, and even by just thinking hard.  It’s a pretty crappy measure of a “treatment”.
Not saying it’s snake oil, but just because it’s published and peer-reviewed doesn’t necessarily make it ‘true’, even if positive effects are associated with it.
The first paper is self-reported outcomes, and the last line of the abstract is that placebo controlled studies are indicated. While I agree with those statements on a technical level, self-reported outcomes are very, very suspect and, as stated, should really only be used as a pilot or justification for a “proper” (aka pain to conduct, expensive) study. Placebo works really well for some people. I’m not here to say their improvements are any less real, just that the mechanism is (likely) vastly different than what is claimed.
The second paper is a pretty weird combination review article and “summary of experiments we did” in mice. Off the top of my head many other mechanisms are possible- localized heating, who knows.
YES‼️This and Methylane Blue used in conjunction. I am satisfied you will be diligent and do your research .
It makes you feel like you’re in a Gaspar Noe flick, which has significant biological effects
I can confirm.
Am old hacker, much of my youth was spent in rooms lit by red led power indicators.
I’m still just as attractive as I was at 20!
Everybody’s standards have slipped, some by enough.
Which is to say not attractive at all BURN
I have the same story, but all my stuff has used green or blue indicators. I am now completely nocturnal and have transparent skin, like a sea creature. I hear strange chanting coming from beneath my basement floorboards… Iä, Iä… Cthulhu fhtagn… Ph’nglui mglw’nfah Cthulhu R’lyeh wgah’nagl fhtagn!
Perhaps the introduction of these new LED colors more recently explains certain societal trends
Changing all my computer applications to a red theme now… look at that screen glow, although my room now looks like the inside of an old submarine in battle mode. But we can’t have wrinkles…
Combat the wrinkles! Red photon torpedoes on tubes 5 and 6! Fire!
Nice YouTube thumbnail, I can’t wait to watch this video. /s
HaD is now into chakras.
There is some science behind it. Even if it doesn’t work, isn’t hacking something to allow you to try it out rather than buying a commercial product what HaD is all about?
Ever considered just logging off, I mean permanently? The world would obviously benefit.
Apparently so is NASA
https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20030001599
One reason it caught NASA’s attention is the fact that an injury on a long duration mission is going to be hard to supply with conventional pharmaceuticals.
NASA has let their name be used by hucksters for decades…zero point energy, reactionless drives, perpetual motion, dowsing, astrology, economics, sociology, marxism etc etc.
Like a TEDx talk, pure bullshit riding on the TED name. TED was briefly something. Not anymore. Guess why?
I don’t get it, why build a brand just to shit all over it?
NASA is a brand IMHO.
Ah yes, the vibe-based method of spotting disinformation. Very nice
I vividly remember “studies” that showed that red LED lights caused muscle weakness. Someone once even demonstrated to a bunch of AT&T engineers (I sh*t you not) that a Texas Instrument digital watch (the old red led kind) made the wearer’s arms weaker (it was the old “slow push / fast push” trick that hucksters had been using forever.
Could we please normalize the fact that there just because there are “studies” doesn’t mean that “there’s science behind it.”
Guess what else has “studies”? Homeopathy, reiki, Ayurveda, “biofields”.
10,000+ papers were retracted in 2023. With AI chum and for-profit paper mills that should probably be millions.
I agree be careful and verify before you believe. However also keep an open mind as so many ‘natural’ and ‘quack’ and other ‘crazy’ remedies over the years have proven to have some basis in fact once the studies are done (though not always the way it was thought etc).
What’s the ratio of “quackery proven turned legit” to “quackery still quackery”?
Because from my perspective for every “yes, a plant based diet may be good for some health issues” there seems to be about a 100 “apple cider vinegar cures everything”.
A $78,000 LED bed when 30 minutes of sunlight will give you exactly the same dosage seems a bit of a “red flag” for me.
A dose of full spectrum vs targeted wavelengths can’t really be considered equal without study.. For all I know the sunlight might be able to do the job but at the same time we already know what UV that is in sunlight does to the skin, and that isn’t particularly good for you (in higher doses anyway), so the concept of a targeted wavelength treatment that triggers only the right biological process selectively likely has merits.
Also the price of the bed is not really relevant – the science behind it will either be true, false or some nuanced middle ground even if it was several powers of 10 more expensive or cheaper. Getting some rich folks to buy something at a high price really isn’t a shocker, its the whole reason Lamborghini  (etc) cars exist, as those really are not about being cost effective…
Also worth considering that the other way as well as how many ‘legit’ ideas get proved to be quackery or at least erroneous in the end – for a prolonged period Earth was the centre of the universe and all else rotates around it, electronics have that hopefully well known oddity in our circles of Conventional Current, it was thought just about the only thing that mattered to survival odds in an amputation was the speed as which it was performed etc etc.
As soon as you start to assume you know without having actually done several lifetimes of research I’d suggest history implies you will be wrong or at best only in the ballpark of correct pretty darn often… Though it might take a century or two for somebody else to prove it, so I guess you could ‘get away’ with it…
Best to believe everything new then, just to be safe.
Truth is you don’t have to listen to that much of the pure bullshit before their lies are just obvious.
It starts getting a little tricky, when the huckster know the ‘bullshit yourself first for quality lies’ trick.
But, bottom line, they’re not that smart on average.
Miss Information isn’t trying to sell us Cherokee hair tampons/red LED beds.
We’re not the target market.
@HaHa because Asbestos really was a wonder material that should be used for everything…
With all new discoveries and ideas scepticism is good, peer review and verification required and caution before widespread use would be generally advisable. But if you don’t actually have proof of snake oil…
I do agree many of these things are clearly pure BS, or worse actively dangerous like those radioactive ‘magic’ bracelets etc. But at least on paper this sounds plausible enough as we do already know certain wavelengths promote tanning, cause skin cancers etc, and that certain reactions happen or happen faster when given the right inputs. The concept seems to have got some research interest, which is promising but not certainty of it being real. And this time its got to be safe enough to try as if was dangerous to be exposed to relatively low levels of red light…
A red LED watch turned to face your skin is sort of worthless, especially the type where you had to press a button to read the time.
Oh so studies aren’t always reliable huh? Jamie let’s pull up those mask studies from 2020 that overturned decades of previous research which used no human subjects, no control, and only water droplets with no live virus
Fantastic reasoning. We should absolutely not research or study anything that doesn’t sound real because even if there’s some studies suggesting there’s merit they could be wrong.
Quantum physics is snake oil and we should stop researching it. If it isn’t intuitive, then it isn’t worth study!
I don’t think OP says “let’s not study”, I think the OP says “the average consumer shouldn’t believe such fads and pseudoscience just because there is a paper supporting it”.
If and when the research proves that there is a population-wide, proven benefit to using such tools, then this scientific knowledge would become common knowledge.
An average home user building these gadgets is good because “making is good” but otherwise it is just silly.
So, I was wondering if she traded the family cow for these beans. And what can I get for an old angry cat?
I’m trying really hard to be respectful, but the core concept that red wavelength light somehow magically fixes skin (which is never defined, as noted by another commenter above) is super suspect.  Not impossible, but everything points to absolutely bunk science. From being extraordinarily expensive to celebrity endorsements to simply not passing the “sniff test.”
.
Being charitable, though, it is certainly true that red light in particular passes through tissue pretty well as any kid that stuck a hand over a flashlight (ok, “torch” to our UK colleagues) has demonstrated. And medical pulse oximeters function in that very same way. Is it doing anything, though? And even if it is doing something, what are the chances that is is beneficial, and so profoundly effective that it is easily detectible in a “hey look how great my skin looks now” … especially on the background of celebrity endorsement, those same people that have a professional team of publicists, stylists, photographers and literally who’s job it is to sell you stuff. Sell you anything. I mean.  Slim to none.
.
All that said, super rad (red?) project by the hacker to spend not a lot of money to at least give it a whirl. If, as I suspect, it is all totally bogus, it is probably also at least totally harmless.  Fun stuff.

So two of those papers are 20 years old and the third is a press release. If NASA had discovered the key to health improvements by using a handful of LED’s I have a feeling it wouldn’t be in the form of a celebrity endorsed magic bed 20 years later.
Hey look! There are “more than 150 published, controlled clinical trials using homeopathy.” https://www.takingcharge.csh.umn.edu/there-good-scientific-evidence-homeopathy
Let’s go cure and prevent horrible diseases with tiny vials of water …
You guys are getting silly and grasping at straws.
Do you think that research has never been ignored for 20 years and then caught on as a fad for capricious reasons?
All you guys have is smug reddit snark, then you are shown studies, then you have smug irrelevant reddit comparisons to chakras or homeopathy “but whatabout” nonsense. It’s a complete non-sequitur. I’m not completely sold on the red light thing either, but the evidence that you are better than those you look down on is pretty thin
Also true that many research concepts will sit on a shelf when the original researcher moves on to a new idea/job, dies etc. Doesn’t mean it was a bad idea, or wrong, just that the immediate results of that original research didn’t gain enough traction to secure funding,. Or sometimes that the concept really needs future tech/knowledge in other areas to actually move further..
“All you guys have is smug reddit snark, then you are shown studies..”
I mean. I also have my 20 years as a professional medical researcher, double doctorate degrees in the field and, like, teach post graduate lectures on objective review of scientific literature.  But whatever, that’s definitely what I (aka The Man) would say. It’s worth the digital ink this is printed on tho
@craig I wasn’t talking to you, but I’m impressed with your credentials. Myself, I’m the Prince of Wales.
Jokes aside, your particular comment was not snarky and did have some nuance. I don’t think you would be one to dismiss a study merely because it came from two decades ago, like Titus did. If you did, I probably would not attend any of your lectures on objective review.
The concept that certain wavelengths of light have effects on the body is not exactly novel.. We all know what a underdose or overdose of ultraviolet can do. But yes, the celebrity endorsements are silly and the idea that you need to spend tens of thousands or even a hundred dollars is absurd. A chicken lamp is a few bucks. Will it do anything? Idk but the chickens do seem to like it
I don’t know if this actually works but I can believe it’s possible.
We know UV matters, also what UV matters? A B C?
A good starting point would be what wavelength are these red LEDs?
Does it even match up with the “science”?
…And could it be the infrared, and the visible red that comes along with it is a red herring? Pun not intended.
Or, of course, another option is that it does nothing at all.
If it has Kim K. on it it’s just expensive Bravo Sierra.
One of the earliest light therapy studies observed hair regrowth in rats. This occurred in the 1960s, during the infancy of laser technology, when its effects were largely unknown.
Research on these devices yields mixed results, which is problematic. However, the limited economic value in funding robust, independent studies, due to the low barriers to entry in this market, leads manufacturers to conduct their own, often biased, research. Furthermore, the underlying biochemistry is not fully understood, complicating matters.
We know that red light penetrates deeper into human tissue via the ‘optical window.’ Could a narrower spectrum produce different results compared to full-spectrum light, even at comparable power per wavelength? This seems plausible, as it could create different energy gradients.
Another uncertainty lies in comparing lasers and red LEDs. Can lasers, with their narrower spectral content, achieve superior results to red LEDs?
It’s intriguing that light therapies are targeted for diverse applications: skin rejuvenation, hair regrowth, adipose tissue reduction, deep tissue injury recovery, and wound healing.
While I believe light stimulation elicits biological responses, I question the extent to which these results depend on other physiological conditions or the placebo effect.
Having worked on one of these devices, I welcome low-cost, open-source options for experimentation. The potential benefits still outweigh the risks (because they are near zero).

  potential benefits still outweigh the risks (because they are near zero

I’d argue that when you factor in that these DIY gadgets will be produced by average home user, with average consumer grade LEDs and used in an uncontrolled environment, there is a significant population risk — skin burns, house fires, cancer to name a few. And the supposed benefits are almost zero (except for very specific applications where the medical professionals actually administer/prescribe the therapy in such cases).
10 minutes lost for 3 minutes of ideas on the matter, yet no info regarding wavelength or results.
I knew about this red light that helps the skin and also help with wounds.
I also know about a blue light mask to help with jetlag.
I also know about a green costume used those days for an irish reason to have a cold one.
Cheers.
I recall the BBC did a story on this red light ‘therapy’, years ago:
How to hallucinate with ping pong balls
https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180124-how-to-hallucinate-with-ping-pong-balls
I’ve tried this actually. It’s not exactly a fat hit of DMT, but it does do something.
The general concept has been around for a long time, and this isn’t one of the better implementations. For instance, this one dates from the 1950s:

I don’t usually get this excited about a CPU, but the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D is something special. It has been impossible to find for weeks, and now it’s back for $479 at Amazon (and at Amazon UK). That’s the official launch price, which is great because I refuse to pay a penny over it.
This processor is built specifically for gaming, and I think it’s the best option on the market right now. It crushes demanding titles with ease, using AMD’s 3D V-Cache technology to push performance beyond what you’d expect from an 8-core CPU. The 96MB of L3 cache is what makes the difference. It minimizes latency and maximizes frame rates, which is exactly what I want from a gaming processor.
$479
Amazon: See here
9800X3D is all about raw performance. It features 8 cores and 16 threads, runs on AMD’s latest Zen 5 architecture, and can boost up to 5.2GHz. While some CPUs rely on brute-force clock speeds or excessive core counts, this one focuses on efficiency and smart caching, which is why it delivers such high frame rates.
I also like that it’s built for the future. It supports DDR5 memory and PCIe 5.0, meaning your system will stay relevant for years. If you’re planning a high-end gaming build, this processor will make sure your GPU isn’t bottlenecked, letting you squeeze every last bit of performance from your system.
If you’re serious about gaming, this is the processor for you. It’s built for AM5 motherboards, meaning you get access to faster RAM, better storage speeds, and PCIe 5.0 compatibility. If you’re upgrading from an older Ryzen CPU or building a new rig, this is the best option for gaming performance at this price.
That said, you will need an aftermarket cooler, since AMD doesn’t include one in the box. Given how well this CPU performs, though, that’s a small trade-off. Plus you'll probably want to buy a water cooler and radiator for it anyway.

12,2025-03-18,"Novak Djokovic co-founded the PTPA in 2020
The players' union co-founded by Novak Djokovic has begun legal action against tennis' governing bodies, citing ""anti-competitive practices and a blatant disregard for player welfare"".
The Professional Tennis Players' Association (PTPA) has filed papers at the United States District Court in New York, where it is seeking a jury trial.
The 163-page lawsuit, which has been seen by BBC Sport, says ""professional tennis players are stuck in a rigged game"" which gives them ""limited control over their own careers and brands"".
It criticises the schedule, ranking systems and control over image rights.
The complaint is being brought by the PTPA and 12 players - including Djokovic's co-founder Vasek Pospisil and Nick Kyrgios. The PTPA says it is acting ""on behalf of the entire player population"".
Formed in 2020, the PTPA wants to increase the power of the players, and reduce the control of the governing bodies.
The ATP Tour, the men's professional body, said it ""strongly rejects the premise of the PTPA's claims"", declaring the case to be ""entirely without merit"" and promising to ""vigorously defend"" its position.
In a statement,, external it accused the PTPA of having ""consistently chosen division and distraction through misinformation over progress"" and said the ATP ""remains committed to working in the best interests of the game"".
The WTA, which runs the women's tour, also said it will defend its position and said in a statement the legal action is ""both regrettable and misguided"".
It added: ""Contesting this baseless legal case will divert time, attention, and resources from our core mission to the detriment of our players and the sport as a whole.""
Players v tennis tours: why the lawsuit and what next?
The lawsuit seeks an end to ""monopolistic control"" of the tennis tour, as well as financial compensation from the ATP, the WTA, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA).
The organisation has also started legal proceedings in the UK and the EU to end what it considers the ""unchecked authority of the sport's governing bodies"".
""Tennis is broken,"" said Ahmad Nassar, the executive director of the PTPA, who told the BBC in October the organisation would have no qualms about going down this route.
""Behind the glamorous veneer that the defendants promote, players are trapped in an unfair system that exploits their talent, suppresses their earnings, and jeopardises their health and safety.
""We have exhausted all options for reform through dialogue, and the governing bodies have left us no choice but to seek accountability through the courts.
""Fixing these systemic failures isn't about disrupting tennis - it's about saving it for the generations of players and fans to come.""
The ITIA said it noted the proposed legal action, adding it is ""proud"" of its ""role in contributing to a clean and fair sport"".
The ITF, describing itself as the ""global guardian of the game"", said it would ""take the appropriate time to consider [its] response"".

'Sport was a big release' - how autism helps Brooksby on court
The PTPA believes, external the governing bodies act as a ""cartel"" by forming agreements with tournaments that cap prize money and prevent potential competitors entering the market.
The union describes the ranking points system as ""draconian"" as it effectively forces a player to enter their tournaments in order to build a status and reputation as a professional.
The lawsuit also takes aim at an ""unsustainable"" schedule which runs for 11 months of the year, and can require players to compete in excessive heat or in the early hours of the morning.
It alleges players suffer serious wrist, elbow and shoulder injuries because the type of ball used changes regularly throughout the season - and that the governing bodies' control of image rights diverts money from players' pockets.
The ITIA is accused of a ""gross invasion of privacy"" for searching the phones of players under suspicion of corruption or doping offences.
The ATP Tour is staging 60 events across 29 countries this year, and also runs its own Challenger Tour. The ATP says it distributed $241.6m to players in 2023 through prize money, bonuses and retirement plan contributions.
The WTA, which is offering 51 tournaments across 26 countries this season, said it paid out record prize money of $221m in 2024. It has also just introduced paid maternity leave for the first time.
Players have frequently complained they do not receive a high enough percentage of the revenue generated by the sport, especially the four Grand Slams.
It was the driving force behind Djokovic's desire to form the PTPA.
The Grand Slams tried to develop the concept of a Premium Tour - featuring a streamlined season and greater financial rewards - but have so far found too many obstacles in their path.
Pospisil says the lawsuit is about ""fairness, safety and basic human dignity"".
""I'm one of the more fortunate players and I've still had to sleep in my car when traveling to matches early on in my career,"" Pospisil added.
""Imagine an NFL player being told that he had to sleep in his car at an away game. It's absurd and would never happen. No other major sport treats its athletes this way.""
""It is time for free-market forces to enter professional tennis,"" said Drew Tulumello of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, the law firm instructed by the PTPA.
The PTPA looks enviously at the rewards earned by players in team sports such as football, NFL, baseball and basketball - and also the more comparable sport of golf.
Many of those who joined the breakaway LIV Tour now enjoy even greater wealth but have lost the ranking points which facilitate entry into the major championships.
Saudi Arabia's intervention caused much bitterness and the new tour changed golf dramatically.
The PTPA's methods are very different, but they could yet have a similar effect.

At Nvidia’s annual GTC conference in San Jose, Calif. today, the chipmaker announced it was teaming up with General Motors to develop next-generation cars, robots, and factories. 
GM says it will apply several of Nvidia’s products to its business, such as the Omniverse 3D graphics platform which will run simulations on virtual assembly lines with an eye on reducing downtime and improving efficiency. The automaker also plans to equip its next-generation vehicles with Nvidia’s “AI brain” for advanced driver assistance and autonomous driving. And it will employ the chipmaker’s AI training software to make its vehicle assembly line robots better at certain tasks, like precision welding and material handling. 
GM already uses Nvidia’s GPUs to train its AI software for simulation and validation. Today’s announcement was about expanding those use cases into improving its manufacturing operations and autonomous vehicles, GM CEO Mary Barra said in a statement. (Dave Richardson, GM’s senior VP of Software and Services Engineering will be joining NVIDIA’s Norm Marks for a fireside chat at the conference.) 
“AI not only optimizes manufacturing processes and accelerates virtual testing but also helps us build smarter vehicles while empowering our workforce to focus on craftsmanship,” Barra said. “By merging technology with human ingenuity, we unlock new levels of innovation in vehicle manufacturing and beyond.” 
GM will adopt Nvidia’s in-car software products to build next-gen vehicles with autonomous driving capabilities. That includes the company’s Drive AGX system-on-a-chip (SoC), similar to Tesla’s Full Self-Driving chip or Intel’s Mobileye EyeQ. The SoC runs the “safety-certified” DriveOS operating system, built on the Blackwell GPU architecture, which is capable of delivering 1,000 trillion operations per second (TOPS) of high-performance compute, the company says. 
Like most automakers, GM has sunk billions of dollars in the development of fully autonomous vehicles — with mixed results. The company’s advanced driver assist feature, Super Cruise, is considered one of the safest and most capable on the market today. But its work to deploy fully autonomous vehicles has been less successful. Last year, GM pulled funding for its Cruise robotaxi company after a number of safety lapses cast doubt on the operation’s future. 
Before it was shuttered, Cruise was exploring developing its own chips to reduce costs for its parent company. The robotaxi startup had been using Nvidia’s in-car computers to power its autonomous vehicles, which executives complained were too expensive. 
GM hopes to improve its self-driving fortunes by selling passenger vehicles with autonomous driving capabilities — though it hasn’t said when or using what technology. 
In a briefing with reporters, Ali Kani, Nvidia’s vice president and general manager of automotive, described the chipmaking company’s automotive business as still in its “infancy,” with the expectation that it will only bring in $5 billion this year. (Nvidia reported over $130 billion in revenue in 2024 for all its divisions.)
Nvidia’s chips are in less than 1 percent of the billions of cars on the road today, he added. But the future looks promising. The company is also announcing deals with Tier 1 auto supplier Magna, which helped build Sony’s Afeela concept, to use Drive AGX in the company’s next-generation advanced driver assist software. 
“We believe automotive is a trillion dollar opportunity for Nvidia,” Kani said. 
GM is the latest car company to strike a deal with Nvidia. The San Jose-based chipmaker has made serious in-roads in the auto industry in recent years, including partnerships with Jaguar-Land Rover, Volvo, Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, Lucid, Toyota, Hyundai, Zoox, and a host of Chinese EV startups.

If you haven’t yet upgraded your smartphone game by switching to the Galaxy S25 Ultra, Samsung is insisting on making it as difficult as possible to resist the temptation. The latest eye-popping incentive to get you to make the big switch to Samsung’s brand-new flagship phone is this instant trade-in offer of up to $900 in instant credit that would bring the price of the Galaxy S25 Ultra 256GB down to just $399.
See at Samsung.com
Even if you skip the trade-in offer, Samsung will give you $300 off of the Galaxy S25 Ultra just to get you to experience its industry-leading features for $999. Great financing and installment offers from Samsung are just more breadcrumbs meant to lead you to maybe the best Android smartphone on the market.
When is a cellphone not just a cellphone? When it’s loaded with incredible features that go well beyond just calling and texting, like the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra’s photo and video features. The 50MP Ultra Wide lens takes incredibly vivid and detailed still and video images, and Galaxy AI takes care of sensing the lighting and making the necessary corrections to skin tones, textures, and other fine details so you’re not having to edit the photos yourself.
That same Galaxy AI also powers the S25 Ultra’s video capabilities, with Night Video and Audio Eraser technology that let you shoot crisp and cleat videos even when there’s barely any natural light, and without harsh background noise to distract your viewers. When you play back your videos or photos, you’ll really appreciate the 6.9-inch screen of the Galaxy S25 Ultra, Samsung’s sharpest and brightest smartphone display yet.
The four beautiful colors of the Galaxy S25 Ultra that you will find in stores â Titanium Black, Titanium Gray, Titanium Whitesilver, and Titanium Silverblue â are joined by three online-exclusive colors: Titanium Jadegreen, Titanium Jetblack, and Titanium Pinkgold. Those are selling like crazy, so availability may be an issue, but regardless of the color, the S25 Ultra is a steal when you max out that $900 trade-in offer.
This is also your chance to max out your dive into the Samsung Galaxy ecosystem, because Samsung is also offering 41% off the Galaxy Buds3 Pro, 25% off the Galaxy Ring, 42% off the Galaxy Watch Ultra, and 30% off the Galaxy Watch7, as if you needed more reasons to head to Samsung now to take advantage of these incredible incentives on their most powerful and versatile smartphone yet, the Galaxy S25 Ultra.

BYD may have taken a huge step closer to making EV charging as easy as filling up with gas, and that could be a major problem for Tesla.

        The Chinese EV giant on Monday unveiled new chargers that it says can add almost 250 miles of range to an electric vehicle in five minutes.
    

        BYD's new 1,000 kW chargers are four times as powerful as Tesla's current 250 kW chargers, which Elon Musk's automaker says can add 200 miles of range in 15 minutes. Tesla plans to roll out 500 kW chargers this year.
    

        The reveal of BYD's new ""super E-platform"" sparked a share price rally, with the company's stock jumping as much as 4% to hit a record high.
    

        Tesla's Supercharger network, which Elon Musk's company began offering in China in 2014, has been crucial in helping it become the world's biggest EV company.
    

        But lengthy charging times and range anxiety are still cited as some of the main reasons people are reluctant to buy EVs. That has sparked a global race to build batteries and chargers that can make charging an electric car as simple as filling up a tank of gas.
    

        The Chinese firms Zeekr and CATL unveiled batteries that could almost fully charge in 10 minutes last year, while Mercedes-Benz last week said its new CLA coupe would be able to add up to 200 miles of range in 10 minutes.
    

        BYD now appears to have leapfrogged its rivals in China and elsewhere with its new charging tech. The tech is set to make its debut on the company's new Han and Tang L EVs, set to go on sale later this year for 270,000 to 360,000 yuan, or $37,300 to $49,800.
    

        ""In order to completely solve users' charging anxiety, our goal is to make the charging time of electric vehicles as short as the refueling time of fuel vehicles,"" BYD's chairman and founder, Wang Chuanfu, said at a press conference.
    

        The new chargers are the latest in a spree of technological advances announced by BYD in recent weeks.
    

        The company in February said it would install advanced self-driving features on its entire vehicle lineup, and earlier this month it unveiled a new roof-mounted drone system.
    

        EV companies in China are under huge pressure to roll out high-tech features such as autonomous driving and voice control as they compete to survive in the country's brutally competitive car market.
    

        Tesla, which counts China as one of its most important markets, is also feeling the heat.
    

        The US automaker saw its Chinese sales fall 49% in February — compared with a 161% rise for BYD — and began offering free trials of its own autonomous driving system on Monday as it looks to claw back market share.

Are tariffs coming? Going? Here to stay?

        Is the US going to invade Greenland? Or Panama? Canada?
    

        What's going to happen to jobs? What about the stock market?
    

        I don't know how this version of the Trump administration is going to pan out. You don't, either.
    

        More important for the ad business: People who make and sell things also don't know, which means they're likely to be more cautious when it comes to spending. Which means they may be looking to cut back on advertising.
    

        And that explains why Brian Wieser, a longtime ad industry executive, has lowered his spending forecast for 2025. A few months ago, Wieser's Madison and Wall firm had thought the US ad business would grow by 4.5% this year. Now they've knocked that number down to 3.6%.
    

        After Trump's election last year, Wieser expected the ad business to encounter bumps for a bunch of reasons, including ""an increased reliance on the idiosyncratic preferences of the president rather than the more predictable institutionally-driven policy-making processes businesses have historically relied upon in the United States.""
    

        But looking back, Wieser says, he underestimated how much uncertainty Trump 2.0 would bring: ""nearly three months into the year, what we can see is a certainty of additional negative factors, including volatility around trade policies and a more extreme threat to supply chains and corporate decision-making than we previously expected.""
    

        You can debate whether business owners and managers should be surprised by Trump's agenda and implementation. But one basic truism about advertising is that it's the easiest thing for companies to cut when things aren't going well — or when they're worried things won't go well.
    

        And some ad sellers I've talked to have reported similar sentiments from some of their clients, ranging from CPG companies to automakers. If you don't know how much your product is going to cost — or whether you'll be able to import it into the US at all — or what consumers' buying power is going to be like, maybe you cut back on some of your ad spending until you have a better sense of things.
    

        It's worth noting that Wieser says his forecast is based on years of studying the ad business, and the economic indicators and decisions he's already seen out of Trump. But it is a forecast — not a reflection of what ad buyers and sellers are doing right now.
    

        Still, as I've noted in the past, shifts in the ad business have made it much easier for skittish buyers to tap the brakes. The move to digital ads also means ad buys can happen in real time, instead of weeks or months in advance. That can super-charge ad buying when things are booming — see the weird pandemic spike of 2021-22 — and it can accelerate declines in the other direction.
    

        ""Decision making is now incredibly short-term oriented,"" Wieser tells me.
    

        So we're not seeing an actual ad slump, yet — every ad forecast I've seen still predicts growth for this year. But if things change, they could change quite fast.

    An apparent battery breakthrough could be good news for the EV industry from a Chinese company that previously pledged to work with Tesla.
  
BYD's claims, if true, could upend the market for EVs and alleviate range anxiety for potential buyers.
Chinese auto manufacturer BYD says it has developed technology that speeds up electric vehicle battery charging to as little as 5 minutes at 1,000 kilowatts, providing enough energy for nearly 250 miles of driving.
The potential battery breakthrough was announced on a livestream on Monday by CEO Wang Chuanfu and sent the company's stock soaring. The charging technology would appear to provide fuel-ups at twice the speed that Tesla currently offers at its Supercharger stations.
BYD says it plans to deploy the charging-infrastructure technology in China. The batteries that can charge that quickly will initially be built into two new vehicles from the company, a sedan and an SUV.
The company didn't say how soon it would build that infrastructure or when those vehicles might be available. 
A representative for BYD didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
If the stated range from BYD is accurate, it could go a long way toward alleviating one of the major impediments for potential US buyers of EVs: range anxiety. For long-range travel across the US, EV owners must plan their trips based on the availability of EV charging locations given that their average range is typically between 200 and 300 miles per charge. But recent policy changes and climate-focused reversals have called into question whether EV networks, such as Tesla's, will continue to expand in the US. Last year, Tesla laid off about 500 workers from its Supercharger team.
Chinese EV companies have been growing quickly and are hoping to get a foothold in other markets as Tesla, the leading US EV manufacturer, has faced backlash over CEO Elon Musk's political activity and other issues. 
Faster EV charging could mean more turnover at existing EV charging stations, and shorter wait times for EV owners. BYD says its new technology makes charging an EV comparable to a gas-powered car in terms of the time it takes to refuel. 
Ryan Rohrman, the CEO of Rohrman Automotive Group, an auto dealer in the Midwest that serves multiple states, said BYD's news could move the needle for the EV industry.
""If BYD's announcement is accurate, it could significantly boost the adoption of EVs,"" Rohrman said. ""Range anxiety remains a major concern, but the ability to recharge an EV as quickly as refueling a gas-powered car would eliminate that worry. The next challenge to tackle is ensuring there are enough charging stations to support widespread use.""

19,2025-03-18,"Have you noticed your iPhone videos keep playing on repeat in the Photos app? Since Apple's iOS 18.2 update, the stock Photos app automatically replays videos until you manually pause them – a feature that might be fine at first but can quickly become annoying, especially with longer clips.
The auto-loop feature can be fun for short clips or when showing someone a quick video, but it forces you to take action to stop each video rather than letting it end naturally. It can be disruptive when you're browsing through multiple short clips in your library, and proves particularly annoying when viewing longer content where you likely don't want to see the same three-minute video play twice in a row.
Fortunately, Apple provides a simple toggle to disable the behavior:

That's all you need to do. Videos in your Photos app will now play once and then stop automatically. No more endless replays.
If you prefer videos not to play automatically at all when you open them, there's a related setting you can adjust. In the same Settings menu, toggle off the Auto-Play Motion option, and videos will stay still until you manually press the play button.

Tesla shareholders recently got some bad news. According to Electrek, the electric vehicle giant is expected to ship the fewest number of vehicles in the first quarter of 2025 since Q3 of 2022.
Tesla is projected to deliver 359,000 units in Q1 2025, according to a Kalshi prediction market cited by Electrek. While that might sound like a lot, it's not for Tesla, and this may be part of a growing trend. Tesla sales have been declining worldwide, especially in Europe.
According to numbers recently released by the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, Tesla vehicle registrations in the European Union and several other European countries dropped by about 45% between January 2024 and 2025, as NPR reported. Sales are down in Germany by a staggering 70% through February for year-over-year data, according to Electrek.
Maybe even more concerning for Tesla is what's happening in China. China accounts for more than a third of global sales for Tesla, and it leads the world in total sales of electric and hybrid vehicles, but Tesla saw sales there drop by 11.5% in January, Inside EVs detailed.
In California, the largest EV market in the U.S., Tesla registrations dropped nearly 12% from 2023 to 2024 even while overall EV sales grew in the state, per Electrek.
While Tesla sales may be down, global EV sales continue to grow and are expected to continue to do so, according to Statista. It appears as though, for one reason or another, consumers are choosing to go with other brands. Some of that was bound to happen to any company boasting sales of around 60% in its industry — about where Tesla was for the U.S. as recently as 2023, per a New York Times data chart — but the slide appears to be greater than most analysts would have likely expected at that point in time.
Sales in California are a good indicator of this slip. As mentioned, Tesla saw a significant drop in the state last year, but overall EV sales were still up 1.2%. Remove Tesla from that equation and non-Tesla EV sales increased by 20% from January 2023 to January 2024, per Electrek.
So, while this may be bad news for Tesla, it's not necessarily bad news for the world's transition away from gasoline and diesel engines, which are relatively inefficient and produce several times as much carbon dioxide pollution per mile, according to Recurrent.
More and more people are upgrading to an EV and rejecting gas-powered vehicles that produce planet-warming pollution, which in turn causes more extreme weather events that threaten lives and the global food supply.
Tesla has been fairly quiet about the slumping sales, and some Tesla supporters believe sales have simply stalled due to the upcoming Model Y changeover. It could also be because there are now more EVs available than ever to consumers.
Others say the sharp decline in Tesla sales is at least partially due to CEO Elon Musk's activity in U.S. and world politics. Those political efforts have been polarizing among U.S. citizens, with a general theme of aiming to dismantle U.S. government services and reduce the federal workforce while implying the country has a problem with a ""parasite class"" who don't earn enough money with their own jobs to avoid requiring help from any healthcare or retirement services.
Some agree with that perspective and have said they support him more for it — with President Donald Trump saying he plans to buy a Tesla as a result — while others have said it drives them away from supporting a company Musk runs.
One person commented on the Electrek article, ""I'm the perfect example of the problem that Tesla is facing. I like EVs. I buy new cars. I'm the car buyer in a multi-driver family. MY most recent car purchase was a Hyundai Ioniq 5. Why? Elon Musk. As long as he's in charge I'll NEVER buy a Tesla.""
Several dozen readers liked this comment or posted to agree with it, though the drop in sales began before Musk took an active role in government this year, so it can't be entirely attributed to any one factor either. If Musk decided to step away and divest from Tesla, that may be the only way to have a pure view at the brand's success on its own — which, by most data-driven accounts from user satisfaction surveys and car reviews by experts, has been high.
In the meantime, Tesla may need a win soon to turn its fortunes around, as the company's stock has plummeted from a 52-week high of $488.54 to under $250 this week.

The AI arms race has been good business for Nvidia, which supplies the highly in-demand chips used by many Big Tech giants and startups alike to train AI models.

        That's also been good news for Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang. In 2024, he shot into Forbes' list of the world's 10 wealthiest people as business boomed for Nvidia.
    

        Huang and fellow Nvidia founders Curtis Priem and Chris Malachowsky planted the seed for Nvidia at a Denny's in northern California in 1993. Today, it's a household name in the AI industry, and Huang is the billionaire businessman leading it.
    

        Here's a look at Jensen Huang's career rise and background.
    

        Huang was born in Taiwan in 1963. He spent some of his childhood there and in Thailand before his parents sent Huang and his brother to the US to live with an uncle in Tacoma, Washington.
    

        His uncle sent him to Oneida Baptist Institute in Kentucky but after Huang's parents immigrated to the US, the family lived in Oregon. He graduated from high school at age 16 before going to college. Huang got his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Oregon State University and his master's degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University.
    

        Huang got his first job at 15. He washed dishes and bussed and waited tables at a Denny's in Portland.
    

        Before founding Nvidia, Huang worked at computer chip manufacturer LSI Logic from 1985 to 1993 and at semiconductor company AMD, or Advanced Micro Devices, from 1984 to 1985.
    

        At a Denny's in 1993, Huang and his Nvidia co-founders, Curtis Priem and Chris Malachowsky, came up with the idea that would eventually lead to Nvidia's creation.
    

        In 1999, the company released the GeForce 256, which it called the first graphics processing unit, or GPU.
    

        Today, Nvidia is instrumental in the generative AI industry, supplying the coveted chips that tech companies use to train AI models.
    

        Interest in Nvidia's chips amid the AI boom has pushed the company to new heights.
    

        In one notable milestone, Nvidia's market cap passed $3 trillion in 2024 to briefly overtake Apple as the world's most valuable company.
    

Huang's net worth is $105.4 billion, according to Forbes.
    

Huang's management and leadership style sees him skipping 1-on-1 meetings, managing around 60 direct reports as CEO, giving feedback publicly, and sending his staff hundreds of emails a day.
    

        Current and former Nvidia employees previously told BI that Huang is a hands-on boss with high expectations and meticulous attention to detail who values owning up to your mistakes.
    

Huang has said he has workaholic tendencies, logging 14-hour days and working on holidays.
    

        He has a tattoo of Nvidia's logo on his shoulder, which he agreed to get when the company's stock price hit $100 per share.
    

Huang's black leather jacket has also become a famous part of his wardrobe — a staple piece he often wears when giving keynotes or showing off a new product.
    

        Nvidia's other founders, meanwhile, have stayed further out of the spotlight than Huang.
    

Priem was Nvidia's chief technical officer from 1993 to 2003, and Malachowsky is a senior technology executive at Nvidia.
    

        After Nvidia went public in 1999, Priem put more than three-quarters of his Nvidia shares into his Priem Family Foundation and by 2006, he'd sold the rest of his shares. He was left with a fortune of roughly $30 million, Forbes estimated in 2023.
    

Huang met his now-wife, Lori, while still attending Oregon State University. The couple share two children: Madison Huang is a director of product and technical marketing at Nvidia, and Spencer Huang is a product line manager at the company.
    

        Huang and Lisa Su, CEO of Nvidia's rival chip giant AMD, are distant cousins.
    

        He has a home in Silicon Valley, as Nvidia is headquartered in Santa Clara, California.
    

        Huang has been president, CEO, and a member of Nvidia's board of directors since the company's creation. He and Nvidia haven't said much about succession planning.
    

        He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2024 and has received the Semiconductor Industry Association's highest honor, the Robert N. Noyce Award.
    

        In past years, The Economist has named Huang the world's best CEO, Fortune has dubbed him its Businessperson of the Year, and TIME has included him in its yearly list of the world's 100 most influential people.
    

        As of March 2024, Huang owned roughly 3.79% of the company's outstanding shares, according to a proxy statement. He is Nvidia's largest individual shareholder.

For Harrison, juggling six remote jobs means occasionally being double-booked for a meeting. His solution? Pay someone to pretend to be him.

        ""My person knows the updates and kind of sounds like me,"" Harrison said, adding that his meetings typically didn't require him to be on camera. Harrison's identity was verified by Business Insider, but he asked to use a pseudonym, citing a fear of professional repercussions.
    

        Harrison, who's a quality assurance professional in the IT sector, has built a team of seven workers who are helping him secretly hold multiple full-time jobs simultaneously. If his employment situation stays the same, he expects to earn $800,000this year and pay his team about $250,000 — his rate isabout $25 to $30an hour.
    

        This is set to be Harrison's fifth year using this model to maximize his income. In 2023, hehad six US-based, full-time remote jobs — three as a W-2 employee and three as a consultant — and earned roughly $470,000, according to earnings documents. Heestimated that after paying his workers, he profited about $320,000. In 2024, he said, he held as many as nine jobs simultaneously, estimating that he earned more than $500,000 after paying his workers — he'll know more definitively once his taxes are completed.
    

        ""I used to be nervous about the boss, losing in the stock market, bills, kids' tuition,"" he said. ""The big difference of having more jobs is I'm less nervous — because if something doesn't go well, it's not going to kill me.""
    

        Over the past three years, BI has interviewed more than two dozen ""overemployed"" workers who have secretly held multiple jobs to boost their incomes and job security. But Harrison is among an even smaller group of job jugglers who have hired people to do some or most of their work, a trend facilitated by the remote work revolution, globalized social networks, and growing access to software tools that make outsourcing one's jobs possible.
    

        To be sure, holding multiple jobs without employer approval could have professional repercussions and lead to burnout. Additionally, return-to-office mandates and a hiring slowdown in white-collar industries have made it harder to land remote roles.
    

        Around 2018, Harrison began working two remote jobs. When the pandemic hit and remote roles became abundant, he started secretly juggling a third and fourth.
    

        The workload soon became unmanageable, so he used the freelance platform Upwork to find qualified people he could trust to take on his work tasks. After interviewing many candidates, Harrison gradually built a team — the members of which he calls employees — and took on more jobs. His workers are in the US, Canada, India, and Pakistan.
    

        Upwork told BI that violating an employer agreement was against the company's policy and that it would take action if a violation was explicitly stated in a platform job posting.
    

        Harrison spends most of his days attending work meetings and reviewing his team's work, which he said added up to about 40 hours a week. Four of his employees complete his work duties while another, his brother-in-law, helps manage the operation and is his stand-in for meetings.
    

        ""He's out of work, so I'm able to help him out,"" Harrison, who's in his 50s, said of employing his brother-in-law. ""Probably the best thing I've ever done.""
    

        Occasionally, he gets laid off from a job or a consulting gig contract isn't extended, he said, so to sustain and grow his operation, two separateemployees apply for jobs on his behalf — he handles the interviews. But in recent months, it's become harder for Harrison to land new remote jobs.
    

        Harrison is a US citizen but lives abroad most of the year and uses a VPN with a US location. His outsourcing operation is possible because software tools such as Zoom, TeamViewer, and UltraViewer give his team remote access to his work computers. He said that he tried to pair employees with a single job but that some were working on twosimultaneously. As far as Harrison knows, none of his employers have suspected his job juggling.
    

        He'll occasionally be asked a question about an employee's work and won't have the answer, but he can stall until that person updates him.
    

        Looking ahead, Harrison plans to keep up his job juggling for the foreseeable future because he doesn't think he has enough savings to retire. He said having about six jobs seemed to be the ""sweet spot"" because he could significantly boost his earnings and job security without working too many hours. And if things become too overwhelming, he can always drop a job.
    

        ""When you're unemployed, the first job that comes around, you've got to take,"" he said. ""I kind of have the ability to choose what I get into.""

MIAMI, FLORIDA - JUNE 04:  MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor  speaks at the Bitcoin 2021 Convention, ... [+] a crypto-currency conference held at the Mana Convention Center in Wynwood on June 04, 2021 in Miami, Florida. The crypto conference is expected to draw 50,000 people and runs from Friday, June 4 through June 6th.  (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)
Strategy, the rebranded MicroStrategy and the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder, made headlines earlier today as it unveiled its latest preferred stock offering, STRF. The company launched a public offering of 5,000,000 shares of its Series A Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock (ticker: STRF), subject to market conditions. The new offering aims to raise capital for general corporate purposes, with a significant portion earmarked for Bitcoin acquisitions and working capital. The new STRF offering introduces a hybrid security designed to appeal to investors seeking lower volatility compared to Strategy’s volatile common stock (MSTR).
The STRF shares will be sold at market price. Strategy offers a liquidation price of $100/share. The liquidation price offered by the company is the amount per share that preferred shareholders are entitled to receive in the event of the company’s liquidation or dissolution, after satisfying debts but before distributing anything to common shareholders. It represents the preferred stock’s claim on assets.
The STRF stock’s dividends compound at an initial rate of 10% annually plus 1% for unpaid amounts, escalating by 1% per period up to a maximum of 18% per annum until settled. The dividend is payable quarterly in arrears starting June 30, 2025, if declared by Strategy’s board of directors. Assuming the full offering is executed as planned, the company would take on a potential $50,000,000 annual dividend obligation.
This is Strategy’s second preferred offering that offers a dividend. Earlier this year the company issued 7.3 Million of Series A Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock, STRK, offering a fixed annual dividend of 8%. This issuance netted the company $563.4 million in proceeds and represents a potential total annual dividend obligation of approximately $58,400,000.
Strategy’s potential cumulative annual dividend obligation from the STRK and STRF offerings, if both are fully executed as outlined, is approximately $108.4 million ($58.4 million for STRK and $50 million for STRF). This figure assumes full issuance and declared dividends. Actual payments depend on board decisions and financial health, making the obligation conditional rather than fixed. The actual dividend amount to be paid may also be higher if dividends go unpaid and triggers rates to escalate from the initial 10%.
The nature of these instruments has sparked a debate online regarding Strategy’s ability to pay the dividends, methods through which it could do so, and what happens if the company doesn’t generate the necessary cash to pay down the preferred stock dividends offered.
First, it’s important to note that, based on the offering details, Strategy has no obligation to issue or pay the dividends. They are all subject to board approval. While it is an option available to the company, not declaring or paying the dividends could impact the share prices significantly.
Second, we can contrast the potential dividend obligations with the company’s operating cashflows from its software business. Strategy’s Q4 2024 earnings report notes $126.6 million in total revenue for the year, but this likely includes some Bitcoin-related adjustments post-adoption of FASB ASU 2023-08 (effective January 1, 2025), which mandates fair value accounting for Bitcoin. Excluding Bitcoin gains, the software business’s contribution to cash flow is likely in the range of $100–150 million annually, based on historical adjusted EBITDA figures. For further context, these were $80-$100 million in 2022-2023, per earlier filings.
If we assume that Strategy’s software business is generating ~$100-$150 million in operational cash flow contributions, the fact that they have just taken on a potential $108.4 million dividend commitment has prompted some investors to ask “what happens if they need to come up with more cash to pay the dividend?”. The answer is that a) the company is not obligated to declare or pay the dividends and b) it could resort to issuing more common shares or selling bitcoin to raise the cash it needs to pay the dividends.
Since Strategy’s first preferred offering, STRK, started trading on February 1st 2025, the stock is up +6%. In that same period, Strategy’s common stock, MSTR, has traded down -16.44%, signalling that investors like the potential yield and protection that the preferred offering provides. Importantly, Strategy’s common shares and preferred shares have both outperformed bitcoin and the Blackrock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) since February 1st 2025, with spot bitcoin and IBIT being down -19% in the same period."

Even down markets can present financial planning and investment opportunities. Here are three money ... [+] moves to consider during a selloff in the stock market.
Most investors seek to avoid downturns in the financial markets. Unfortunately, volatility is an unavoidable part of being a long-term investor. The best time to plan for any type of volatility or financial crisis is in advance. But, even down markets and short-lived selloffs can present financial planning and investment opportunities. Here are three money moves to consider when the stock market is down.
With few exceptions, keeping excessive amounts of cash hurts your ability to build wealth. Even in periods of higher interest rates, the real return on cash after taxes and inflation can be negative. Over the long run, only the equity markets have the potential to earn returns that outpace inflation. This can make the difference in having enough money to retire.
As illustrated in the chart below, over prolonged periods, returns on cash (Bloomberg 1-3 month Treasury Bills as a cash proxy) is far below gains on investments in stocks and bonds.
Keeping too much cash is a drag on your portfolio and ability to grow your wealth. 
If you have too much cash on hand as a long-term investor, a market downturn may present an opportunity to put sidelined cash to work in your portfolio. So if stocks are down, consider it an opportunity to buy more shares for the same level of investment. To smooth the ride, consider dollar-cost averaging cash into the market.
It's common for investors to feel apprehensive about investing when the markets are volatile. But it's also common for those same investors to regret not investing when things eventually improve (and are more expensive). In another words, why wait for higher prices if you can buy something on sale today?
Tax-loss harvesting means selling securities that have lost value in your portfolio, realizing losses for tax purposes. Losses can offset taxable capital gains, and potentially ordinary income by up to $3,000 in the current year. Any remainder can be carried forward to future years. For investors with a brokerage account or living trust, tax-loss harvesting could present a tax planning opportunity.
Your taxable capital gain or loss ultimately depends on how your gains and losses net out at the end of the year. The process for netting capital gains first applies to gains and losses of the same holding period: long-term gains against long-term losses, and separately, short-term gains against short-term losses. If the resulting short-term and long-term figures involve a gain and a loss, they are netted once more.
Wash-sale rules are one of the most important parts of tax-loss harvesting to be aware of. Under the wash-sale rule, if an identical or substantially identical asset is purchased within a 30-day period (before or after) when an asset was sold for a loss, the loss will be disallowed.
A market downturn or selloff in the stock market could actually be helpful for investors looking to convert pre-tax money to a Roth IRA. When you convert from an IRA to an after-tax Roth IRA, the amount converted is included in your taxable income. It's not typically advantageous for high-earners to do Roth conversions while working, but in retirement or market downturns, it may be worth considering.
Instead of selling your positions and converting cash, consider converting the ETFs or mutual funds instead. This way you won't be out of the market or incur additional transaction costs. Again, although no one likes a down year in the financial markets, it can be a good time for Roth conversions as market values are depressed.

Pebble Core Time 2
Pebble is back and is betting that a 30-day battery life can shake up the smartwatch market dominated by Apple Watch. The company is making a comeback with the Core 2 Duo and the Core Time 2. Led by original Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky, these offerings provide an alternative to the smartwatch market led by the Apple Watch.At $149, the Core 2 Duo is an upgraded version of the classic Pebble 2, featuring modern enhancements such as a black-and-white e-paper display, 30-day battery life, and a polycarbonate frame. The extended battery life comes with trade-offs, as e-paper screens refresh more slowly and lack the vibrant colors and high refresh rates of traditional OLED smartwatch displays.In contrast, Apple's Series 10 offers only 18 hours of battery life but excels with a brighter, more colorful display and extensive health-tracking capabilities, including a new sleep apnea detector. Apple's Series 10 also features deep iPhone integration with Apple Pay, Siri, and fast-charging. The Apple Watch SE, which starts at $249, is a more direct price competitor to Pebble's models, offering core Apple Watch functionality at a lower cost. Two new smartwatches from Pebble.

It claims 30 days of battery life but lacks an always-on display and advanced sensors like ECG or blood oxygen monitoring.Both Pebble watches contrast Apple's polished integration and proprietary software. Pebble's open-source PebbleOS appeals to tech enthusiasts seeking customization, with support for sideloading apps and community modifications. Pebble devices can't match Apple's seamless ecosystem integration, especially regarding iOS functionalities like Apple Pay and Fitness+ tracking.

I wish them well. My wife has a Huawei Watch GT4 which is perfect for what she wanted (design and battery life) but she complains about the restrictions Apple imposes with regards to her iPhone. She's hoping the EU will be able to change that.In the meantime she loves the vibrant screen, fluidity of HarmonyOS and week long battery life plus 'fast' charging.

From the link: ""Apple claims their restrictions on competitors are only about security, privacy, crafting a better experience etc etc. At least that’s what they tell you as they tuck you into bed. I personally don’t agree - they’re clearly using their market power to lock consumers into their walled ecosystem.""It's really hard not to laugh out loud. Apple has ALWAYS been about a walled garden. Not a bug, but a feature. And for years and years (and years) it was roasted for this approach while Apple buyers were ridiculed as stupid sheeple being led to certain slaughter because Apple and its walled garden were doomed in the face of Windows and Android freedom! Funny thing: consumers voted with their wallets for the walled garden and made Apple the most successful consumer electronics company in history. Another funny thing: the competitors stopped predicting doom for the walled garden and are now wailing--with apologies to Pink Floyd--to tear down the wall! Now the walled garden, because it has become so successful thanks to consumers choosing it, is ""anti-competitive."" Oh, give me a break and tough luck! If you like the freedom of an open system, you have plenty of other choices which, collectively, outsell Apple by a lot. Have at it! Just leave me and my choice to buy into the walled garden alone.

Just no. I had a Pebble before Apple released their Watches didn't like it at all. While I don't wear watches as a fashion statement, I like them to look nice as well as be functional to whatever degree I desire at the moment. So good luck to Pebble. I don't mind that they can't play in Apple's yard. I wish Apple would follow Hauwei  and Samsung's lead and make a round Watch. I've looked at the latters' offerings and haven't seen one that would make a good casual-dress watch, like a Rolex Datejust. Something that doesn't have to look like a smartwatch when I don't need it too. Apple has a few watch faces that fit the bill but I'm getting tired of the same old-same old rectangular shape. The Series 10 does soften that a tad. But even Apple needs to do a little more to make the Watches and faces look a little more elegant without being busy or ornate. Pebble need not apply.

Elon Musk and his many projects have had a rough couple of months, but SpaceX nailed an undisputable win for him on Tuesday.

        The rocket company's Crew Dragon spaceship splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico, carrying two NASA astronauts who were stuck on the International Space Station for about ninemonths.
    

Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore became international news after their Boeing spaceship glitched as it approached the ISS in June. NASA decided it was safer for them to fly SpaceX home. The change of plans meant they had to stay and serve a full shift with the next astronaut crew, turning their original weeklong mission into nine months.
    

        Their safe return is a win for Musk after a series of high-profile setbacks, from exploding Starship rockets to a Tesla stock crash.
    

        Musk did not respond to a request for comment.
    

        Williams' and Wilmore's return is a much-needed win for SpaceX and Musk, who is struggling recently.
    

        Musk himself said on Fox Business that he's had ""great difficulty"" running his companies since taking on the Department of Government Efficiency, which was created by an executive order by President Donald Trump and aims to slash federal spending.
    

        He didn't elaborate, but that day Tesla's stock had dropped 15%, bringing Musk's net worth down$29 billion.
    

        Tesla has also been the subject of a series of protests, boycott efforts, and vandalism incidents in recent months. The electric vehicle company's sales have plunged in multiple countries, including the US.
    

        That all culminated in Trump promoting Tesla cars last week on the White House lawn, where he inspected and praised five of thecompany's vehicles and said he would buy one.
    

        ""The Radical Left Lunatics, as they often do, are trying to illegally and collusively boycott Tesla, one of the World's great automakers, and Elon's 'baby,' in order to attack and do harm to Elon, and everything he stands for,"" the president wrote on Truth Social ahead of the Tesla event.
    

        Then there's SpaceX. The company's up-and-coming Starship mega-rocket was making significant progress with each uncrewed test flight until this year, when two consecutive flights ended with premature explosions.
    

        Those flightsare experimental. In early March, however, one of the company's routine Falcon 9 rocket launches encountered an unexpected issue: The rocket's booster, which normally lands itself on a droneship for reuse, instead caught fire and toppled over after landing.
    

        All the while, Musk has been contending with criticisms and backlash against DOGE — from legal challenges to scrutiny of its hires.
    

Corporate experts have told Business Insider that Musk is ""way overstretched"" since taking on DOGE and ""may have finally reached his tipping point.""
    

        SpaceX has been scheduled to bring the two astronauts back since August, when NASA officials decided they weren't confident enough in Boeing's spaceship to return Williams and Wilmore.
    

        Musk started teeing their return up as a new victory in January, when he said on X that President Trump had asked SpaceX to bring them home ""as soon as possible.""
    

        Musk has since said on Fox News that Williams and Wilmore were ""left up there for political reasons,"" which multiple astronauts have disputed. The day ahead of their return flight he shared a video of Wilmore saying he appreciated Musk and Trump.
    

        Despite the hubbub, this was a pretty routine flight for SpaceX. It was the 10th time the company's Crew Dragon vehicle has returned NASA astronaut crews to Earth in the last five years — in addition to five private Crew Dragon flights.

Oculus founder Palmer Luckey was fired from Facebook in 2016, but that didn't stop him from betting on the company five years later.

        When Facebook announced that it would rebrand to Meta in 2021, Luckey used it as an investment opportunity despite having ""never really bought into"" the metaverse ""buzzword,"" he said during an episode of the ""What's News"" podcast.
    

        Yet, ""the day that Meta changed their name from Facebook to Meta, I did take literally all of my liquid cash and use it to buy Meta shares,"" Luckey said.
    

        Before generative artificial intelligence and chatbots boomed in popularity, CEO Mark Zuckerberg was pitching another buzzy idea, the metaverse, to investors and consumers. It was a virtual reality world accessible through VR headsets.
    

        Silicon Valley eventually moved on, however, and the metaverse was declared dead in 2023 by Ed Zitron in an obituary for Business Insider.
    

        Zuckerberg told investors that Meta is planning $60 billion to $65 billion in capital expenditure for 2025, with AI being a main focus. Luckey, however, isn't so sure it's time to say ""rest in peace"" to the metaverse.
    

        ""There's been a lot more talk of AI, but that's what you have to do when you're a publicly traded company, and investors are comparing you with your peers, and they see that their peers are heavily investing in AI,"" he said when asked about his position on Meta's current vision.
    

        Still, Luckey said, their public communications aren't exactly an indicator ""of where strategic priorities truly are in someone's brain."" He used himself as an example, saying his priorities for 2026 haven't been publicly discussed.
    

        Meta, then Facebook, acquired Oculus for $2 billion in cash and stock in 2014. Luckey remained with the company, working on its VR headset efforts, until he was fired in 2016. His dismissal came after he donated to an anti-Hillary Clinton political group, though Meta denied that was why he was fired.
    

        He has previously said he's taken his ousting as a business lesson. He has no problem seeing Zuckerberg around at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago these days, Luckey said during the episode.

Elon Musk is evidently a fan of men named Larry.

        In a wide-ranging episode of the ""Verdict with Ted Cruz"" podcast released on Monday, the Republican senator asked Musk to name the smartest guy he's ever met or a CEO he greatly admires.
    

        ""Larry Ellison is very smart,"" Musk said, picking at his black blazer while referring to the cofounder of Oracle. ""I will say Larry Ellison is one of the smartest people.""
    

        Musk then mentioned Larry Page, the cofounder and first CEO of Google.
    

        He went on to say that he thinks intelligence can be measured by a person's accomplishments.
    

        ""To some degree, smart is as smart does,"" Musk said. ""What have they done that is difficult and significant? You know, Jeff Bezos has done a lot of difficult and significant things."" The compliment comes despite a 20-year rivalry between Bezos and Musk, particularly over their dueling space ambitions at Bezos' Blue Origin and Musk's SpaceX.
    

        Musk's praise for the tech billionaires comes as the cohort has faced a steep drop in their net worth over the past several weeks, with the stock market plunging amid economic uncertainty. Ellison, Page, and Bezos are worth $169 billion, $149 billion, and $218 billion, respectively, according to the latest Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Though he's still at the top of Bloomberg's list, Musk has lost billions, with 30% of his fortune erased in 10 weeks as Tesla stock plummeted.
    

        The interview also touched on Musk's efforts at the White House DOGE office and his attempts to slash the federal workforce. Musk said that the situation at the federal government was ""worse than I expected,"" but that means there's great room for improvement.
    

        His tactics, though, have drawn sharp criticism from many federal employees and everyday Americans.

Recession Global Market Crisis Stock Red Price Drop Arrow Down Chart Fall, Stock Market Exchange ... [+] Analysis Business And Finance, Inflation Deflation Investment Abstract Red Background 3d rendering
The first lesson I learned about investing in the market came at the tender age of 10. I had been investing my pocket money in Australian gold shares since I was about seven, with my father simulating the broker and docking my allowance by the equivalent of 25 cents a week. I made a hefty $20 – and $20 was a lot for a kid in 1971.
The real lesson came a couple of years later when my father explained that all I had to do was know which way the market was going – up or down – and invest accordingly. To my 10-year-old brain, that didn’t seem like good advice. It certainly didn’t explain my father’s obvious success. Where was the magic in that piece of wisdom? Even as a kid, I knew it couldn’t be that simple.
Yet 30 years later, I realised that it is exactly that simple. After all, if you don’t know which direction an asset’s price is going, why would you invest in it?
Although theory suggests that charts do not contain any information about trends, it’s hard not to see obvious trends in them – especially in long-term time series. Can it really be true that the general market trend isn’t shown by the long-term S&P 500 chart? It’s there because there is a trend, and that trend is what we used to call “progress.”
Here is the obvious example:
The S&P 500 chart shows a long-term trend upwards
Even fundamentalists like Warren Buffett essentially say that, in the long run, the stock market can only go up. Most investors implicitly agree with this, believing “the market is going up” and putting their money to work accordingly. However, even in the long run, there are nasty corrections – even for the biggest, most secure stocks and indices – which can create a lot of medium-term pain.
You can be a buy-and-hold investor, and historically, that has been a great strategy. Alternatively, you can buy, hold and try to avoid the crashes – this is the approach I’ve taken for years. For me, the market is going up in the long term, but if you can avoid a crash and buy at the bottom of a slump, you’ll be in even better shape.
It’s hard to time it perfectly, but I’ve managed to do so pretty much since the dot-com crash, with only on instance where I got out only to find that the correction didn’t turn into a full-blown crash. You should be able to trace some of these events here on Forbes, as I’ve been writing about major market crashes for two decades, covering entry and exit points.
Let me be clear: I’m 100% out of U.S. equities and about 70% out of my non-U.S. portfolio. The remaining stocks are in sectors that should, in theory, be more resilient in the current downturn –defence, agriculture, and physical gold ETF – but I may well go 100% cash depending on what happens next.
I hate being in cash. I hated to sell Intel, even though I believe it can go to the moon, but in a crash everything gets crushed. Only special situations have a chance of not getting sucked down with the general market. When a real crash happens, everything can turn to dust, and the bigger the crash, the broader the devastation. Normality does not apply in a crash.
I believe this correction will become a crash, and that crash will turn into a sustained bear market. By “bear market,” I mean in the classic sense – a market trending downward over an extended period – not the modern, clueless definition of a market following a crash.
This bear market could be exceptionally bleak, because prices are so high that even a fall long-term average valuations would feel catastrophic.
This outcome is not inevitable, but avoiding it will take a near miracle.
For sure, risk assets don’t like risk and chaos. Unfortunately, chaos rides out, unbounded.
Consider the prosed cut of $1 trillion cut in U.S. government spending. That alone could push the U.S. into recession – even if some of those funds were being squandered in fraud and waste. That money still flow into the economy and juices it. If these budget cuts are go through, they will put millions on the unemployment rolls.
The Trump tariffs will and must spike prices, cutting U.S. spending power, worsening the recession, and triggering a global downturn. We’ll see higher prices but no increase in money supply – unless the Federal Reserve launches a QE bazooka. Either way, what happens then? Budget cuts and tariffs are a double whammy that risk leading to a depression. The economy tanks, unemployment rises, and government tax revenues collapse.
If that weren’t enough, escalating geopolitical tension will only add to the economic strain.
How can all these overlapping factors combined not throw the U.S. and global economy into turmoil, creating a negative feedback loop?
We don’t even have to guess the direction of interest rates, the value of the dollar, or global appetite for U.S. debt. The answer is already obvious.
It has to be down – unless the angels sing.
So let me attempt a projection as a benchmark for what happens next. It’s ugly, but it’s simply a roadmap:
The S&P 500 chart with my projection for what might happen next 
Unless there is a sudden outbreak of sanity, we are in for an almighty crash. It’s extremely hard to judge just how deep that crash will be. Since the global financial crisis, market drivers have evolved from free-market dynamics to central banking policies, and now to political chaos. That chaos has no end in sight.
At the very least, all investors should get their affairs in order. Face it, when politicians tell you that what they’re doing will cause “short-term pain”, history tells us that what’s coming next will be epic – and not in a good way."

Investors who went to the ballot box last fall with their pocketbook top of mind could be battling a case of voter's remorse, even as market strategists say it's way too soon to lose hope.

        US stocks slipped into correction territory less than two months into President Donald Trump's second term — a stark contrast to the rip-roaring rally after he won in 2016.
    

        Voters who were fed up with inflation and keen for tax cuts and deregulation may be frustrated by the administration's decision to prioritize revising trade policy with tariffs, or import taxes.
    

        Tariffs provide a financial incentive for consumers and businesses to buy domestic goods, which fits with Trump's ""America First"" policy. However, economists worry that they'll fuel inflation and lead to retaliatory tariffs that would hurt domestic businesses, resulting in less spending and slower growth overall.
    

        Although few are ready to call for a recession, there's an increasingly serious risk of stagflation, according to UBS Global Wealth Management. The firm, which has long been optimistic, thinks the odds of a frightening scenario where economic growth disappoints while inflation picks up are 20%, up from 15% before mid-March.
    

        ""We expect aggressive trade policy to weigh on US economic growth, but not so much as to drive the US toward a recession or to prevent a recovery for equity markets,"" Solita Marcelli, an investment chief at UBS GWM, wrote in a March 17 note. ""That said, last week we changed our scenarios to reflect that the risks around our central scenario are now skewed to the downside.""
    

        Despite these concerns, Trump's team is defying consensus wisdom by using tariffs to shake up the status quo in global trade, which they see as unfair to the US. Markets aren't pleased with this approach, but the new administration doesn't seem to mind.
    

        Trump's supply-focused economic philosophy revolves around bringing back US jobs and delivering the tax cuts and deregulations championed by conservative economists. In theory, this plan could boost domestic output and the middle class.
    

        But Jason Draho, the head of asset allocation Americas at UBS GWM, isn't confident that tariffs are the best tool to achieve those aims.
    

        ""By introducing tariffs potentially at a significant level, at a minimum, you're disrupting supply chains and throwing things off,"" Draho said in a recent interview. ""So that's a negative supply story. That's why it's bad for growth and it's bad for inflation. And so that's not unlike what happened during the pandemic, when supply chains got all messed up — you had this inflationary shock.""
    

        Higher prices could be transitory since there'd be a one-time adjustment for tariffs, Draho said, though those were nearly the Federal Reserve's famous last words during the early 2020s.
    

        ""To me, it's not so much stagflationary as that you end up just having lower growth and lower inflation when it's all said and done — especially if you can't do much in the terms of fiscal [stimulus],"" Draho said. ""You can't shift demand higher. All you can try and do is make the supply side more efficient later on, which I think is still the policy of the administration.""
    

        And even if inflation stays in check despite tariffs, that could be due to lower growth, Draho said.
    

        But while markets are antsy about stagflation, a recession still seems unlikely for a few reasons.
    

        Key economic indicators, from GDP growth to job additions, have been a bit soft but are far from contractionary territory. Corporate earnings, meanwhile, have been highly impressive.
    

        Besides, what may be spooking investors most is how aggressive trade policy could affect businesses and consumers, which is easily controllable — unlike inflation or the pandemic. UBS suspects Trump will change course if his trade war is causing the US too much economic pain.
    

        ""We believe it would be politically counterproductive for the Trump administration to pursue policies that risk pushing the economy into recession,"" David Lefkowitz, UBS GWM's head of US equities, wrote in a mid-March note.
    

        Investors hate uncertainty, often even more than bad news that's clarifying. However, Draho thinks Trump is keeping other nations, and the market, in the dark to maximize his leverage.
    

        Trade policy should become clear in early April, when Trump is expected to make a call on the reciprocal tariffs he's teased, Draho and Lefkowitz indicated.
    

        In the meantime, markets must grapple with ""peak uncertainty,"" in Draho's words. Trump could opt for a universal tariff, put different levels of levies on nations with certain conditions attached, or scrap them altogether. In response, other nations could retaliate with harsh measures, work with Trump to restore trade relations, or agree to certain concessions before tariffs take effect.
    

        This economic game theory may be dizzying, but Trump does have a dominant strategy, which Draho outlined in a recent note: follow through on his tariff pledges, and then adjust as needed.
    

        ""Doing so reduces the costly uncertainty,"" Draho remarked. ""And while tariffs bring their own economic pain, if they're known, then consumers and businesses can at least plan accordingly.""
    

        If all goes well, Trump can keep the economy afloat and fulfill the promises he campaigned on.
    

        But the plan could easily backfire. Companies may rather bear the cost of tariffs, which could go away with a pen stroke, than invest unspeakable sums to revamp their supply chains. And even if businesses do build factories in the US, Draho said it would take at least 18 to 24 months to get them running, so the benefits might not materialize until the second half of Trump's term.
    

        ""In the meantime, you could have significant [issues] to try and deal with higher costs,"" Draho said. ""That certainly flows through to the consumer. What's the near-term pain you can tolerate for the hopes for longer-term benefits?""
    

        So although Draho understands Trump's tariff gameplan, he ultimately believes the president will be forced to adjust it — either by markets or voters.

F Stock
 
Amid market volatility following tariff announcements, Ford stock (NYSE:F) stock is up about 4% year-to-date, while its peer – GM stock – has declined 8%. We believe Ford’s consistent financial performance and attractive 7x 2025 earnings valuation indicate further upside potential.
Ford stock looks risky - but a good pick to buy at its current price of around $10. We believe there are several major concerns with F stock, which makes it risky despite its current valuation being extremely low. Separately, with diabetes on the rise, see Buy, Sell, Or Hold DexCom Stock At $70?
 We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of F stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Ford Motor along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a very weak operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. However, for investors who seek lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception.
Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, F stock looks very cheap compared to the broader market.
• Ford Motor has a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 0.2 vs. a figure of 3.2 for the S&P 500
 • Additionally, the company's price-to-operating income (P/EBIT) ratio is 7.3 compared to 24.3 for S&P 500
 • And, it has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 2.5 vs. the benchmark’s 24.3
Ford Motor's Revenues have grown marginally over recent years.
• Ford Motor has seen its top line grow at an average rate of 10.8% over the last 3 years (vs. increase of 6.3% for S&P 500)
 • Its revenues have grown 5.0% from $176 Bil to $185 Bil in the last 12 months (vs. growth of 5.2% for S&P 500)
 • Also, its quarterly revenues grew 4.9% to $48 Bil in the most recent quarter from $46 Bil a year ago (vs. 5.0% improvement for S&P 500)
Ford Motor's profit margins are worse than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe.
• Ford Motor's Operating Income over the last four quarters was $5.2 Bil, which represents a poor Operating Margin of 2.8% (vs. 13.0% for S&P 500)
 • Ford Motor’s Operating Cash Flow (OCF) over this period was $15 Bil, pointing to a moderate OCF-to-Sales Ratio of 8.3% (vs. 15.7% for S&P 500)
Ford Motor's balance sheet looks weak.
• Ford Motor's Debt figure was $161 Bil at the end of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $39 Bil (as of 3/17/2025). This implies a very poor Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 424.1% (vs. 19.0% for S&P 500). [Note: A lower Debt-to-Equity Ratio is desirable]
 • Cash (including cash equivalents) makes up $38 Bil of the $285 Bil in Total Assets for Ford Motor. This yields a moderate Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 13.4% (vs. 14.8% for S&P 500)
Ford Motor stock has fared worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. Worried about the impact of a market crash on F stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes.
• Ford Motor stock fell 56.5% from a high of $25.19 on 17 January 2022 to $10.95 on 28 December 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500
 • The stock is yet to recover to its pre-Crisis high
 • The highest the stock has reached since then is $15.35 on 5 July 2023 and currently trades at around $9.90
• Ford Motor stock fell 50.1% from a high of $8.03 on 20 February 2020 to $4.01 on 23 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500
 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 22 October 2020
• Ford Motor stock fell 86.3% from a high of $9.20 on 14 October 2007 to $1.26 on 19 November 2008, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500
 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 15 December 2009
In summary, Ford Motor's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows:
• Growth: Neutral
 • Profitability: Weak
 • Financial Stability: Very Weak
 • Downturn Resilience: Very Weak
 • Overall: Weak
While the stock’s weak fundamentals might suggest inherent risk, we believe Ford stock presents a buying opportunity, supported by its low valuation.
While Ford Motor stock looks promising, investing in a single stock can be risky. On the other hand, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

37,2025-03-18,"Somewhere between the period of 1999 and 2007 a plague swept through the world, devastating lives and businesses. Identified by a scourge of electrolytic capacitors violently exploding or splurging their liquid electrolyte guts all over the PCB, it led to a lot of finger pointing and accusations of stolen electrolyte formulas. In a recent video by [Asianometry] this story is summarized.
The bad electrolyte in the faulty capacitors lacked a suitable depolarizer, which resulted in more gas being produced, ultimately leading to build-up of pressure and the capacitor ultimately failing in a way that could be rather benign if the scored top worked as vent, or violently if not.
Other critical elements in the electrolyte are passivators, to protect the aluminium against the electrolyte’s effects. Although often blamed on a single employee stealing an (incomplete) Rubycon electrolyte formula, the video questions this narrative, as the problem was too widespread.
More likely it coincided with the introduction of low-ESR electrolytic capacitors, along with computers becoming increasingly more power-hungry, and thus stressing the capacitors in a much warmer environment than in the early 1990s. Combine this with the presence of counterfeit capacitors in the market and the truth of what happened to cause the Capacitor Plague probably involves a bit from each column, a narrative that seems to be the general consensus.


“More likely it coincided with the introduction of low-ESR electrolytic capacitors,”
y’know, that really rings true. Most of the culprits I’ve seen WERE the low-ESR types. Most of the other caps on a board are usually fine, and if they’re not they’re usually located right next to a heat-producing component.
Maybe because the caps that were not low-ESR were not stressed that much?
Heh, your post reply made me think back to just when this was happening.
Heat cycles seemed to play a big part in it, and this would have been the first generation of board throwing some serious heat at the (incidentaly low ESR) caps near the CPU heatsinking. Although I did see failures in the presumably audio system electrolytic cap as well. Those normally were in a fairly clear area of the case.
I can’t recall if PSUs saw an unexpected spike in failures. Which you’d expect if the problem was capacitors generally. I don’t remember that being the case and they are spec’d a bit different.
Around that time I worked in a computer shop. PSU failures also were a daily happening, mostly customers explaining in complete shock how much smoke just escaped from their computer.
I must say however that most of those PSUs were of the cheaper type and always developed a strange smell after about a year of usage (probably due to failing caps).
The more expensive power supplies from Antec, Chieftec, or any other more expensive than bargain basement company seemed to last.
I would not expect the low ESR to be incidental. As that will reduce impedance these caps would also have seen the ‘brunt’ of the current draw larger transient swings that come part and parcel with higher TDP’s.
My biggest problem with Caps was in the old Samsung 22″ monitors.  We had a ton of these at work at the time and they’re were great 16:10 and people would get two of them.  But they would die over time and instead of tossing them, I convinced my boss to give me a couple which I re-capped, then I did a bunch at work as well.
I’d read the corrosion inhibitor was missing in the stolen electrolyte formula, this was the entire problem.
I prefer 1980’s caps – no safety vent and we used to blow them up for fun.
The video here actually tries to evaluate the sources.  The conclusion is that this part of the story may have just been repeated hearsay. You don’t have to agree, but it’s interesting to hear it criticized.
Used to use a model train power supply to blow them up.  They would go “POP” then uncurl across the room.
Ofcourse in reverse polarity to speed up the process!
My electronic class was a blast… literally. Someone wired a cap to AC power cord, put it behind plexi and plugged it in. Then turned on the breaker for the outlet.
The plastic jacket was embedded into student’s sweater about 20 feet away and the 1/4″ inch plexi had a hole in the middle.  They never found the metal housing.
I’ve never in my life heard anyone refer to electrolytic capacitors as E-Caps. It’s jarring and makes the video sound like something an outsider has swotted up on. The report is well researched, but he brings no insider insights.
Elkos. In German, they’re being called Elkos..
We also still use the antique “condenser” term (Kondensator) rather than “capacitor”.
Likewise, we use “coil” (Spule, for spool) or “choke” (Drossel) instead of “inductor”.
I think it’s interesting how different certain things are in different places!
The electric symbols are different sometimes, too.
“Q” often is a mixer transistor/oscillator instead of a plain transistor.
For that, “T” is used. In English schematics, “Q” is just another transistor.
Then, there’s that wire resistor that English schematics use. Very odd in our eyes.
Over here, we use a rectangular box for a generic resistor.
Or let’s take the trace drawing. We don’t use bulges when traces overlap.
We rather draw over them and use dots in case they make connections.
It’s basically same in Czech and Slovak language… tlumivka (dampener/quieter/choke), civka (coil), kondezator. Schematic symbols and namings are also the same as in German too.
in Danish “lytter” short for elektrolytter
In the US we use T for “transformer, and L for “inductor.”  We quit doing the humps to show non-connecting lines on a schematic many decades ago, I suppose because draftsmen were taking too much time as schematics got more and more complex as smaller, cheaper parts allowed getting lots more on a board or in a product.
(FWIW, I am not the other “Garth” who has replied in this topic.  He’s not using a last name.)
When I was studying for my Radio Amateurs License Many of the old timers used the zig zag line for resistors. But I had been taught the box in electronic class. We had a short discussion on it at the time. They concluded that the symbol had been changed to meet an international standard and they were wrong. They changed to the new symbol going forward to help newcomers.
The zig-zag symbol for resistors is the ANSI standard.  The A in “ANSI” stands for “American” though, and perhaps Europe and other areas have differing standards.  I think the zig-zag makes the schematic easier to read and find things at a glance.
Same in Dutch: elco, elektrolytische condensator.
I’ve never liked the use of boxes to represent resistors, because boxes can be used to represent anything: transformers, diodes, delay lines, and whole subsystems are common uses.
Nah, you just like it better because you were raised with it, nobody uses ‘boxes for diodes’ and such. And the cases where a box encloses a non-resistor component are unambiguous. Nobody confuses a (narrow) box-drawn resistor for anything else.
It’s fine to like the zigzag version, and might find it easier to get a glance-overview of a circuit when you are used to them as compared to the box version, but don’t think up nonsense to justify it.
Exactly!
I’m a big fan of Asianometry and he normally does a great job explaining some very complicated topics, typically around silicon chip fabrication processes.  But the insistence on calling them “E-Caps” got my hackles up and made me question the validity of the rest of the video.
He said that he called them e-caps simply because, for some reason, he didn’t like to have to repeat the word “electrolytic.”  If English isn’t his native language, he still does an excellent job of it.
Slightly off-topic, but what peeves my grits is musicians who insist on saying “pup” instead of “pickup” or “tranny” for “transmission” which is confined to car fanciers.  No one says “I sent a coded tranny to my associate.”  And English speakers who say “VW” when “Volkswagen” is faster.  Yes I know in German VW is shorter.
HaD owners should really drop daily article quota and introduce “quality” metric instead. If I wanted to watch five too long and totally boring videos created by content creators I’d just go to YouTube, search “electronics hobby” or “computers hobby” and filter by “long, recent videos”.
How about you just skip over the articles you’re not interested in and leave them for those of us who are?
HaD isn’t written to accommodate your specific interest in every article,  nor mine.
A world with positive feedback only would quickly turn into chaos.
And a world with negative feedback only would quickly turn to shit.  Your point?
Agreed. I watched the whole video and thought it was interesting. I couldn’t care less about the endless string of “Kristina keyboards” posts, and as you suggest, I just skip them.
I haven’t seen a single one of those in the last ~3 years. Thanks to this uBlock rule:

  hackaday.com##.series_of_posts-keebin-with-kristina

Oh – the humanity.  Brutal.
I’m not too interested in those articles either, but I do often enough find the pictures that come with it interesting, the novel/fancy keyboards often look plenty ‘hacky’ and make me think of making something myself, albeit not necessarily keyboard related.
And sometimes they remind me of good science fiction which is also pleasant.
Meh have you seen the slop everywhere lately? This is quality now
Super capacitors had the same problem. I, and many others that own the Davis Vantage Pro 2 weather station have had to replace leaky super caps in the ISS (Integrated Sensor Suite) or outdoor sensor array. The ISS has a solar panel that provides daytime power and charges the super cap. The super cap (10F) provides power for overnight up to a couple of days of low sunlight. There is a lithium battery that kicks in should the super cap run down. When the super cap fails the weather station would continue running until the lithium battery died and then would start only transmitting data when the solar panel received sufficient sunlight then stop transmitting at sundown. Replacing the super cap was fairly easy except if the ISS station was roof or pole mounted and it was winter time. In spite of that minor past inconvenience the Davis VPRo 2 is highly accurate, has shorter data transmission times (2.5 secs) and has the longest transmission distance compared to far cheaper “so called professional” stations found on various discount sites.
I wish I thought ahead of time to save every bad cap from the great plague that I have pulled and replaced. I want to know how big a jar they could fill up by now. It’s certainly been plenty.
Real life needs a stats page full of counters for various trivial things
We had a bad batch of capacitors at work about that time, or a little earlier.  It seems like it was late 90’s, but I could be wrong.  These however were not exploding or rupturing, only shorting, and it was only one value, one size, one voltage, 220µF 16V  6x11mm.  They began going down after only a few years of service, maybe less, in something that went into private aircraft and did not get used many hours per year.  After seeing a bunch of these making up nearly all our repairs, I decided that anytime a unit came in, we would just replace all those capacitors, regardless of what it came in for.
(FWIW, I’m not the same Garth who replied above without a last name.)
Garth Bock here.
RoHS is the reason. At least that is what i think.
RoHS introduced new requirements (being “green”), while at the same time prohibited proven, reliable solutions. So designers and manufacturers focus was shifted away from things like reliability, failsafe, fault tolerance, etc. As a result we got additional E-waste because everything failes much earlier.
In the video, at 13’40, [Asianometry] says that electolyte becomes too alcaline, so this means electrolyte is basic, implying that leaks should be neutralized with some acidic solution.
But in a thread on EEVblog someone says it is acidic (https://www.eevblog.com/forum/beginners/what-chemical-to-clean-the-pcb-after-leaking-capacitors/msg1207699/#msg1207699) and that one should use a basic solution to neutralize leaks (but a post later on in the same thread recommand to use white vinegar…).
So what is the truth?
Beside neutralizing leaked electolyte, what is the best way to remove corrosion it left?
Bodge wire, generally. Replace the copper if it’s bad enough. Although I imagine if it’s more than surface on a many layer board it’s probably stuffed.
This seems like something a strip of PH test paper could solve. But I think what you actually care about is not neutralizing the spill, but removing it from the PCB entirely. If it dissolves in an acid, great! Do that and then wash the excess acid away with water.
Ah, the memories… I retired my old AMD K6-2 around this time, then bought a new PC with money I earned replacing motherboard capacitors. :P
i am lucky, i’ve only once had capacitor failure.  i mean, i assume there are some dead devices i’ve run into with bad capacitors but only one mattered enough to look into it.  around 2009, my 2003 athlon became unreliable.  i looked at the motherboard and the capacitors in its voltage regulator were swollen.  so the fun part, i simply underclocked it and it was steady for a year or so until i decided to buy another pc
also reminds me of my intel core 2 duo i replaced it with, eventually the fan died and again i simply underclocked it and ran it without a fan for a while
performance sure places a lot of demands on hardware

TMUS Stock
 
Question: How would you respond if you owned T-Mobile stock (NASDAQ: TMUS) and its value dropped by 25% or more in the coming months? Although this scenario might seem extreme, it has occurred before and could happen again. In fact, T-Mobile stock has performed strongly this year, rising 15% year-to-date in 2025 and nearly 60% over the past 12 months. These gains were driven by robust postpaid phone customer acquisitions powered by its 5G network and by synergies from the Sprint merger that boosted earnings. The company has also successfully expanded into the broadband market with its fixed wireless offering, utilizing excess spectrum acquired from Sprint. However, the broader market is experiencing a significant sell-off, fueled by growing concerns about a U.S. recession following tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on major trading partners. Although telecom stocks are generally considered defensive, T-Mobile’s premium valuation and status as a growth stock might make it more vulnerable to a correction during a market downturn.
Here’s the point: The main takeaway is that in a downturn, T-Mobile stock might suffer significant losses. Data from 2020 shows that TMUS stock lost more than 26% of its value within a few quarters and experienced a peak-to-trough decline of about 57% during the 2008 financial crisis—performing slightly worse than the S&P 500. This raises the question: Could the stock be sold off to the point where it falls to $120 if a similar scenario were to occur? Naturally, individual stocks tend to be more volatile than diversified portfolios. Consequently, if you seek growth with lower volatility, you might consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns of over 91% since its inception.
Possibility of Lower Customer Growth: T-Mobile has been increasing its share of the U.S. wireless industry's net customer additions by leveraging its valuable mid-band spectrum for 5G wireless technology. This mid-band spectrum offers a balanced combination of speed and coverage, in contrast to the millimeter-wave spectrum—which delivers ultra-fast speeds but limited coverage—that competitors like Verizon and AT&T initially emphasized. For context, the carrier added a record 903,000 net postpaid phone connections in Q4 2024. However, this growth may begin to slow as the wireless market becomes more competitive, with other players progressively deploying their own mid-band 5G spectrum and thereby reducing T-Mobile's early-mover advantage. Furthermore, rival AT&T has been notably aggressive with its device promotions in recent years, which could also affect T-Mobile’s future performance. Additionally, intensified competition might lead to higher churn rates or a slowdown in new sign-ups, ultimately impacting margins. These combined pressures could weigh on both profitability and stock performance in the near term.
Economic Uncertainty Could Also Impact T-Mobile, as the company is highly dependent on consumer spending. President Donald Trump’s aggressive tariff measures—including a 20% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico, along with stricter immigration restrictions—have raised concerns about a potential resurgence of inflation. These factors suggest that the U.S. economy might face significant challenges and even a recession – see our analysis here on the macro picture. Last week, in an interview, the President did not dismiss the possibility that new tariffs could trigger a recession.
Considering the increased uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration’s policies, these risks are particularly significant. The ongoing Ukraine–Russia conflict and global trade tensions further cloud the economic outlook. Tariffs raise import costs, which in turn lead to higher prices, reduced disposable income, and diminished consumer spending. Although T-Mobile’s wireless services are essential and likely to hold up in a downturn, the rising cost of its plans could deter customers from upgrading to premium offerings. This shift could affect T-Mobile’s growth and profitability in the future.
TMUS stock has proven to be more resilient than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some recent downturns. While investors hope for a soft landing in the U.S. economy, one must wonder how severe a recession could be if it were to occur again. Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash illustrates how key stocks performed during and after the last six market crashes.
• TMUS stock declined by 12.1% from a high of $115.57 on 6 January 2022 to $101.62 on 23 January 2022, compared to a peak-to-trough drop of 25.4% for the S&P 500
  • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 3 February 2022
  • Since then, the stock has risen to a high of $272.83 on 3 March 2025 and is currently trading at approximately $255
• TMUS stock dropped by 26.0% from a high of $100.49 on 19 February 2020 to $74.32 on 18 March 2020, in contrast to a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500
  • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 18 May 2020
• TMUS stock declined by 57.5% from a high of $50.42 on 9 October 2007 to $21.42 on 20 November 2008, compared to a peak-to-trough drop of 56.8% for the S&P 500
  • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 24 October 2016
At its current price of about $255 per share, T-Mobile is trading at roughly 24x consensus 2025 earnings, which appears somewhat expensive compared to its peers. For example, AT&T trades at below 13x forward earnings, while Verizon trades at below 10x forward earnings. Although T-Mobile’s recent financial performance has been robust, markets are often short-sighted—projecting short-term achievements into the long term. In T-Mobile’s case, it is assumed that the company will continue its strong record of subscriber additions and achieve double-digit earnings growth. However, there is a genuine possibility that subscriber growth may slow as competition intensifies and as other U.S. carriers further deploy their mid-band spectrum. Additionally, the substantial cost reductions T-Mobile experienced following the winding down of its Sprint integration might eventually diminish, affecting earnings growth. Furthermore, increasing economic uncertainty in the U.S. could also negatively impact the stock.
Considering the potential slowdown in growth and broader economic uncertainties, ask yourself the question: will you hold onto your T-Mobile stock, or will you panic and sell if it starts dropping to $225, $200, or even lower? Holding onto a declining stock is never easy. Trefis works with Empirical Asset Management—a Boston-area wealth manager—whose asset allocation strategies yielded positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P lost more than 40%. Empirical has integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio into its asset allocation framework to offer clients improved returns and lower risk compared to the benchmark index—a less turbulent experience, as demonstrated by the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Asian equities had a strong day led by Hong Kong after U.S.-listed China ADRs rose, while Japan, India, and Malaysia saw gains, though Indonesia fell.
Hong Kong grinded higher on strong volume and strong breadth, as advancers handily outpaced decliners by nearly 4 to 1, while Mainland China bounced around the room. This morning’s BofA fund manager survey noted a big decline in U.S. equity allocations while there were increases in Europe and emerging markets. U.S.-listed China stocks and European ETFs have not seen significant flows year-to-date, possibly indicating that U.S.-based investors haven’t adjusted their portfolios versus foreign investors repatriating capital. It’s hard to say, though, that the geopolitical narrative is likely a factor preventing more U.S. investors from allocating.
It is interesting how little media coverage there was of President Donald Trump’s comment overnight that President Xi will visit Washington, D.C. “very soon."" That trip and a subsequent trade deal could dissipate the geopolitical headwinds.
Hong Kong-listed internet stocks had a strong day after Monday’s release from the State Council, the highest level of the Chinese government, emphasizing domestic consumption. Alibaba led the way higher, up +5.83%, while Tencent gained +3.15% ahead of their financial results tomorrow. The highest level of the Chinese government telling you they are focused on domestic consumption is not subtle. Several big corporate announcements were a factor today, including:
After the Hong Kong close, online real estate company KE Holdings (BEKE US) beat on revenue but missed on adjusted net income and adjusted EPS. Before the U.S. market opened, Tencent Music Entertainment (TME US) beat analyst expectations on revenue, adjusted net income, and adjusted EPS. Southbound Stock Connect was a rare net sell, as Alibaba saw profit taking. Chinese Treasury bonds rallied after selling off Monday. Reuters listed the U.S. and global CEOs attending next week’s China Development Forum in Beijing, which includes a meeting with Xi. I’ll put the article up on Twitter/X, though notable corporate attendees include FedEx, Qualcomm, Citadel, Blackstone, Pfizer, Mastercard, and Chubb.
The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech indexes gained +2.46% and +3.96%, respectively, on volume up +16.79% from yesterday, which is 177% of the 1-year average. 392 stocks advanced, while 85 declined. Main Board short turnover increased by +10.54% from yesterday, which is 151% of the 1-year average, as 13% of turnover was short turnover (Hong Kong short turnover includes ETF short volume, which is driven by market makers’ ETF hedging). The growth factor and large capitalization stocks outperformed the value factor and small capitalization stocks.

CVS Stock
 
CVS Health stock (NYSE: CVS) has become one of the top performers this year, increasing nearly 50% while the broader S&P500 index has declined by 4%. Investors are optimistic that the company can overcome its difficulties following last year’s 40% drop in its stock price, which was mainly due to rising medical costs affecting profitability.
Several factors have boosted renewed investor confidence, including the company’s strategic focus on improving operational efficiency and reducing costs. In addition, recent changes in the executive team have been welcomed by investors. The firm appointed Steve Nelson, former CEO of the UnitedHealthcare division at UnitedHealth Group, as the new head of Aetna. Furthermore, David Joyner succeeded Karen Lynch as CVS’s new Chief Executive Officer in October last year. Market sentiment also indicates that the Trump administration might introduce more favorable pricing models for insurance companies that cover senior citizens under private plans, which could benefit companies like CVS.
Despite these encouraging developments, potential downside risks should be considered. How would you respond if CVS stock dropped by 40% or more in the coming months? Although this scenario might appear unlikely, past trends suggest it is within the realm of possibility. At present, broader markets are undergoing a selloff amid rising recession concerns in the U.S., partly due to President Donald Trump’s tariffs on key trading partners.
A key point is that during economic downturns, CVS stock could suffer significant declines in valuation. Data from 2020 shows that the stock lost over 25% of its value in just a few quarters, and the effect was even more dramatic during the 2008 recession when CVS lost 45% of its value. With CVS stock having already risen about 50% this year to $65, investors should consider whether adverse market conditions might reverse this trend. If similar economic pressures occur, the stock could potentially fall below $40. However, for those investors looking for lower volatility than what individual stocks offer, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio provides an alternative – having outperformed the S&P 500 and delivered returns of over 91% since its launch.
Although CVS shows promising potential through its initiatives to improve profitability, investors must also weigh broader economic risks. As a major provider of health insurance, CVS Health is vulnerable to rising costs for medicines and medical supplies, which directly increase healthcare expenses and add pressure to its insurance operations.
Even though inflation worries have eased somewhat, they still remain an important factor. President Trump’s firm policies on tariffs and immigration have renewed concerns about possible inflationary pressures. This uncertainty, along with the U.S. economy’s susceptibility to contraction, increases the likelihood of a recession.
The global geopolitical climate has grown increasingly unstable, marked by the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict, heightened trade tensions, and worsening relations with traditional allies such as Canada, Mexico, and various European nations. These external factors add considerable risks to the market environment. See our analysis here on the macro picture. In light of these complex dynamics, investors should closely monitor macroeconomic indicators when assessing their positions in CVS or other similar healthcare investments.
CVS stock has performed slightly better than the S&P 500 index during some recent downturns. Concerned about the effect of a market crash on CVS stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash shows how major stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes.
• CVS stock fell 20.7% from a high of $110.83 on 8 February 2022 to $87.84 on 12 October 2022, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500
 • The stock is yet to recover to its pre-Crisis high
 • The highest level reached since then was $103.79 on 12 December 2022, and it currently trades around $66
• CVS stock fell 27.3% from a high of $71.94 on 20 February 2020 to $52.30 on 16 March 2020, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500
 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 16 November 2020
• CVS stock fell 45.6% from a high of $44.12 on 5 June 2008 to $23.98 on 9 March 2009, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500
 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 16 February 2012
CVS Health’s Revenues have grown robustly, with an average annual increase of 8.5% over the past three years, outpacing the S&P 500’s 6.3% growth during the same period. However, this growth is also reflected in the company’s valuation, as CVS stock now trades at roughly 12x trailing earnings—a slight premium relative to its five-year average P/E ratio of 10x.
The company’s medical cost ratio has notably risen from 83.8% in 2022 to 92.5% in 2024, marking a significant decline in this key profitability metric. Given current industry trends and company-specific factors, a near-term return to the more favorable 2022 levels seems unlikely.
Considering the potential for slower growth and broader economic uncertainties, ask yourself this question: Will you hold your CVS stock, or will you panic and sell if it starts to fall to $50 or even lower? Holding on to a declining stock is never easy. Trefis partners with Empirical Asset Management—a Boston area wealth manager—whose asset allocation strategies delivered positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P lost more than 40%. Empirical has incorporated the Trefis HQ Portfolio in this asset allocation framework to provide clients with better returns and reduced risk compared to the benchmark index, offering a less volatile experience as shown in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

In recent years, the U.S. restaurant industry has experienced a turbulent period, with economic pressures, shifting consumer habits, and rising operational costs forcing many once-thriving chains to scale back or shut down. While restaurant closures periodically happen, the number of restaurants shutting their doors in 2025 signals deeper challenges.
Among the problems faced by restaurants include inflation and labor shortages, which make it more difficult for chains to keep up with various trends and competitive pricing without sacrificing quality. Brands that have become American household names and opened hundreds of restaurants nationwide are being forced to make cutbacks and sacrifices.
Burger chains are no exception, with a few big names axing several stores in the first quarter of 2025 and more to come. Though burgers are quintessential American cuisine (over 60% of sandwiches sold in the U.S. are hamburgers), the market is also very saturated. If a consumer wants a burger, they have plenty of options. And with shoppers becoming more frugal with their hard-earned cash, some burger chains are struggling to stay afloat.


Unfortunately, TGI Friday's, is on the list of beloved restaurants we might lose this year. Known for its lively happy hours with cocktails and appetizers (some better than others), the chain has seen a sharp decline. In 2020, the chain operated 386 restaurants in the United States; As of March 2025, it is down to 123. 
TGI Friday's made its debut in New York City in 1965, quickly gaining popularity for its burgers, appetizers, and classic American fare. However, more recently, it has seen a string of misses. Last November, the chain filed for bankruptcy but shared that its restaurants would stay open. In a press release, Rohit Manocha, Executive Chairman of TGI Friday's Inc., called the move ""difficult but necessary."" Since then, the chain has experienced some relief. In January, a judge agreed to let TGI Friday's to sell nine of its 39 corporate-owned restaurants, allowing the brand to lessen its debt by over $34 million. 
Yet, this outcome was not enough to save TGI Friday's from several closures at the start of 2025. In January, the company's final four locations in Las Vegas were given the boot, turning the entire region into a TGI Friday's dead zone. Over 30 locations across New York, Ohio, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Maryland, New York, and Pennsylvania were shut down in the same time frame, with more closures likely to come. This follows a rough year in 2024 that saw around 100 Friday's closures. 


Bad news for Wahlburgers fans. Hy-Vee, the employee-owned Midwestern supermarket chain announced in January that it will be closing 79 of its in-store Wahlburgers locations. Hy-Vee first partnered with the fast food chain in 2018, later converting some of its Market Grille restaurants into Wahlburgers. Conveniently, shoppers can still grab a quick bite to eat at Hy-Vee. The supermarket is refreshing its dining strategy by replacing the burger joint with its Market Grille concept.
This is quite a blow for Wahlburgers, as many of its locations were inside Hy-Vee grocery stores. The closures leave the fast food chain with around 40 locations in the United States. Despite the setbacks, the team at Wahlburgers remains positive, with CEO Randy Sharpe noting that Wahlburgers has performed better in its standalone locations and the split is ultimately is for the best. Ideally, Wahlburgers will regain its footing soon, allowing fans to continue to enjoy the chain's juicy beef, fluffy potato buns, and signature Wahl sauce for years to come.


Established in 1951 in San Diego, California, Jack in the Box has seen more than its fair share of ups and downs over the years. Currently, the fast food chain is still perfecting its balancing act. In February 2025, the company announced the closure of six underperforming locations. Conversely, the burger chain also expanded, opening five new outlets in potential hotspots. This strategic approach may allow Jack in the Box to position itself for optimal success.
With minor setbacks, 2024 presented some difficulties for the burger chain. However, the restaurant managed to open multiple new locations, including five in and around Detroit. By the end of the year, Jack in the Box sales dropped by just 1.3%. Even with its slightly rocky start into 2025, Jack in the Box is committed to maintaining its relevance while honoring its legacy as a pioneer in the drive-thru industry."

A video posted Monday by the UK activist group Led By Donkeys shows a former Tesla owner using a harrow dragged by a Tesla to etch the protest into the beach at Black Rock Sands in Wales.

        The slogan reads ""Don't buy a Tesla"" alongside an outline resembling Musk's controversial gesture at a Trump rally in late January.
    

        The video features a woman named Prama, who said she drove a Tesla for six years. She said she started questioning her ownership when Musk ""started getting onto the ticket of the extreme far right.""
    

        Prama said there was ""no turning back"" for her after Musk's ""Nazi gesture.""
    

 View on Threads


        Musk has denied the gesture was a Nazi salute, calling the claims ""ridiculous"" in an appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast last month.
    

        Led By Donkey said in a Facebook post: ""Thousands of people are ditching Tesla. Here's one of them with a message you can see from space."" The slogan is said to be about 800 feet long.
    

        A spokesperson for the group told BI the video's message was ""clear"" — ""to fight the oligarchs taking unaccountable power, we need to hit their bottom line.""
    

        Led By Donkeys, initially set up as an anti-Brexit group, has frequently targeted Musk in recent months over his support for Trump and right-wing European parties such as Germany's AfD. Its other stunts include projecting videos of his gesture on Tesla's factory in Berlin.

        Another activist group called Everyone Hates Elon has been placing paid-for advertisements on bus stops in London this month.
    

        The protests come as Musk's DOGE cost-cutting efforts have sparked a backlash against his EV maker.
    

        Some Tesla owners have vowed to sell their cars, some citing Musk's work directing DOGE's layoffs, his gesture at the Trump rally, and fear of being harassed.
    

        Tech CEO Mitchell Feldman, a Tesla Model Y owner, told BI he was confronted in a parking lot while on his way to a concert in London. Tesla showrooms and vehicles have also become targets for protests and vandalism.
    

        Tesla stock has been under pressure, falling 37% this year. Last week, JPMorgan analysts slashed their price target of the company by about 41% to $135.
    

        ""We struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly,"" they wrote.
    

        While still comfortably the world's richest person, Musk's net worth has dropped by $121 billion this year to $312 billion following the slide in Tesla stock.

Melinda French Gates, 60, isn't looking back after her divorce from Bill Gates.

        In an interview with Elle published on Monday, French Gates spoke about the dissolution of her marriage to the Microsoft founder.
    

        ""Look, divorces are painful, and it's not something I would wish on any family,"" French Gates told Elle.
    

        The philanthropist, who shares three children with Gates, said that ending her marriage was one of the hardest yet most significant decisions she's ever made, per Elle.
    

        The pair first met in 1987, shortly after French Gates started working at Microsoft as a product manager. After seven years of dating, they married in 1994. In May 2021, they announced they were ending their marriage after 27 years, and their divorce was finalized in August.
    

        French Gates also said she was not interested in dating at the moment.
    

        ""But again, I knew when I got divorced, I would be okay on my own. And I think that was the most important thing,"" French Gates said.
    

        She had a hopeful answer when asked what she wanted someone to know about her if they Googled her five years from now.
    

        ""She's thriving on the other side of a divorce,"" French Gates said. ""Just thriving.""
    

        French Gates' comments come after her ex-husband told The Times in January that their split ""was the mistake I most regret.""
    

        ""You would have to put that at the top of the list,"" Gates said when asked if the divorce was his only failure in life. ""There are others but none that matter. The divorce thing was miserable for me and Melinda for at least two years.""
    

        The Microsoft founder added that he and French Gates still see each other at family events.
    

        In the wake of their split in 2021, The Wall Street Journal reported that French Gates had been seeking a divorce since 2019 when it was publicly revealed that Gates had met with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein multiple times. There were also reports of Gates' extramarital affairs during his tenure as Microsoft CEO.
    

        In a 2022 CBS interview with Gayle King, French Gates described her emotions after the divorce and said she was ""grieving"" the loss of something she thought she had for a lifetime.
    

        ""I had a lot of tears for many days,"" French Gates said, recalling how she would lie on the floor and think, ""How can this be? How can I get up? How am I going to move forward?""
    

        The former couple did not have a prenuptial agreement and split their property according to a separation contract. Following their split, Gates transferred over $6 billion worth of stock to French Gates.
    

        According to Bloomberg's Billionaires Index today, French Gates's net worth is about $15 billion.
    

        A representative for French Gates did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider outside regular hours.

47,2025-03-18,"The diver had found the fibre optic cable lying on the seabed of the North Sea. He swam closer, until it was near enough to touch.
He reached out his hand. But someone could tell he was lurking there. Someone was watching.
""He stops and just touches the cable lightly, you clearly see the signal,"" says Daniel Gerwig, global sales manager at AP Sensing, a German technology company. ""The acoustic energy which travels through the fibre is basically disturbing our signal. We can measure this disturbance.""
Multiple reports of damaged telecommunications cables in the Baltic Sea have raised alarm in recent months.
So important are these cables, which carry huge volumes of internet data between countries, that Nato has launched a mission called ""Baltic Sentry"", to patrol the Baltic Sea with aircraft, warships and drones.
The EU is also stepping up measures to monitor and protect cables. 
Despite those efforts the authorities cannot be everywhere at once. 
So, some companies are trying to monitor what's going on in the vicinity of any cable – by using fibre optic signals to listen out for surreptitious underwater drones, or hostile vessels dragging their anchors along the seabed.
It was during tests of AP Sensing's system last year – not a real attempt at sabotage – that the diver patted his hand on the subsea cable watched over by the firm.
The company also deployed ships, drones and divers with sea scooters to find out how accurately its software could pick out and identify the presence of these vehicles.
And, the team tested whether their cable could ""hear"" a vessel plunging its anchor into the water.
When pulses of light travel along a fibre optic strand, tiny reflections sometimes bounce back along that line. These reflections are affected by factors including temperature, vibrations or physical disturbance to the cable itself.
Noticing a temperature change along part of a buried cable could reveal that part has become unburied, for example.
AP Sensing shows me a video of a man walking across a lawn before lifting up a rifle and firing it during a test. A fibre optic cable buried in the ground a few metres away picked up the whole sequence.
""You see every single footstep,"" says Clemens Pohl, chief executive, as he points to a chart revealing disturbances in the fibre optic signal. The footsteps appear as brief blips or lines and the gunshot as a larger splodge.
With this technology, it is even possible to work out the approximate size of a vessel passing above a subsea cable, as well as its location and, in some circumstances, its direction of travel. That could be correlated with satellite imagery, or even automatic identification system (AIS) records, which most ships broadcast at all times.
It is possible to add monitoring capabilities to existing fibre optic cables if one unused, ""dark"" fibre is available, or a lit fibre with enough free channels, the firm adds.
There are limitations, however. David Webb at Aston University says that fibre optic sensing technology cannot pick up disturbances from very far away, and you need to install signal listening devices, or interrogators, every 100km (62 miles) or so along a cable.
AP Sensing says that it can pick up vibrations hundreds of metres away but ""usually not several kilometres away"". The company confirms that its technology is currently deployed on some cable installations in the North Sea, though declines to comment further.
""People really need an early warning in order to determine what to do,"" says Paul Heiden, chief executive of Optics11, a Dutch firm that also makes fibre optic acoustic sensing systems.
Mr Heiden argues that cables installed solely for the purpose of monitoring marine activity could be especially useful – one might place such listening cables, say, 100km from a vital port, or in the vicinity of a key gas pipeline or telecommunications cable, rather than within those assets themselves.
That could give operators an overview of vessel traffic in the area, and potentially advance notice of a ship heading towards a critical asset.
Optics11's fibre optic listening technology can be deployed on military submarines, Mr Heiden adds, and he says the firm is soon to begin testing a monitoring cable installed somewhere on the floor of the Baltic Sea.
Demand for fibre optic sensing technology is growing, says Douglas Clague at Viavi Solutions, a network testing and measurement company: ""We do see the number of requests increasing.""
Some of the cables damaged in recent incidents were made by Swedish cable company Hexatronic, says Christian Priess, head of Central Europe, Middle East, Africa and submarine cable business at the firm.
Acoustic sensing is an emerging technology that Mr Priess suggests will become more common in the future. But there's relatively little one can do to protect a cable from sabotage, in terms of physical strengthening.
Today's fibre optic cables already have metal casings folded and welded shut around the fibres, he says. There is also ""armoury wire"", thick metal cords, running along the outer parts of the cable and in some cases there are two layers of these cords. ""On the UK side of the Channel where you have a lot of rocks and a lot of fishing, you want to have it double-armoured,"" says Mr Priess.
But should a vessel deliberately drag its heavy anchor across even a double-armoured cable, it will almost certainly still damage it, Mr Priess says – such is the force of the collision or pulling action. 
While it is possible to bury cables in the seabed for additional protection, this might become prohibitively expensive over long distances and at depths below a few dozen metres.
""Cables break all the time,"" says Lane Burdette, research analyst at TeleGeography, a telecoms market research firm. ""The number of cable faults per year has really held steady over the last several years,"" she adds, explaining that the 1-200 faults that typically occur annually has not risen despite ever more subsea cables being installed during that period.
Ms Burdette also notes that, even when a cable is severed, telecommunications networks typically have significant redundancy built into them, meaning that end users often don't notice much disruption to their service.
Still, the visible military response to cable breakages in the Baltic Sea is welcome, says Thorsten Benner, co-founder and director of the Global Public Policy Institute, a think tank: ""It's good that Nato and the European Union have woken up.""
And while cable sensing technology might be useful, its efficacy in terms of preventing damage rests on how quickly coastguard or military patrols could receive alerts about potential sabotage and react. ""The question is how quickly you could establish contact with a vessel,"" Says Benner.

54,2025-03-18,"A Russian state-owned conglomerate said it's rebuilt its regional jet using locally sourced parts — and successfully flew a prototype for 40 minutes.
Rostec said on Monday that the test flight showed the Yakovlev Superjet-100 can fly with the Russian PD-8 engine, which replaces a previous engine reliant on a French manufacturer.
The project is part of Rostec's effort to ""Russify"" its aircraft as international sanctions cut off the flow and maintenance of the Superjet's parts, many of which were previously Western.
The French company Thales, for example, supplied the Superjet's avionics, while US firms provided flight controls and auxiliary power units. Thus, the sanctions posed a critical problem for Russia's commercial fleet, making it difficult for them to receive the servicing needed to fly safely.
Rostec's solution is ambitious. It seeks to replace all foreign parts of the Superjet with Russian components and have the airliner certified to enter service by 2025. By 2030, it hopes to fill an order for 89 of the ""Russified"" jets.
The replacement plan was already floated in 2021 as Moscow's tensions with the West soured, but the need for it was exacerbated by the Western sanctions that followed Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
""After 2022, the Superjet will have to be essentially reassembled from scratch,"" said Sergey Chemezov, CEO of Rostec, in the company's statement.
Chemezov acknowledged that completing the project by the deadline could be difficult, saying it was ""being implemented in a very tight timeframe by the standards of the global aircraft industry.""
The Superjet was Russia's 2011 answer to regional aircraft like the Embraer E-jets and the Bombardier CRJ, with about 100 seats.
These are typically designed for shorter trips, with distances similar to flights from New York to Miami.
Rostec and the United Aircraft Corporation, its subsidiary company responsible for the Superjet, said they've been adjusting the Superjet by gradually replacing its Western parts and conducting tests.
A prototype of the Superjet successfully flew for 54 minutes in August 2023, but that was with its old French-Russian engine — the PowerJet SaM146.
The company said that after the recent test flight with the replacement engine, the PD-8, it expects to get certification for the Russian component by the fall of this year.
With Russia largely sanctioned from the international market, Rostec will likely be unable to sell its modified Superjet, which it now calls the Superjet-New, to most countries and airlines.
Rostec also hopes to similarly replace the foreign parts on its flagship airliner, the MC-21. Local airline Aeroflot has ordered 339 ""Russified"" planes, including the Superjet-New and the MC-21.
The US Treasury Department and the European Commission did not respond to requests for comment on the Superjet tests sent outside regular business hours by Business Insider.

The world feels more unmoored than ever, and, predictably, the ad dollars are pulling back in kind.
Marketers have been murmuring about it for weeks. The whiplash of trade tariffs, the slow grime of inflation and the lingering chill of last year’s rate hikes have left them wary, hesitant to commit dollars in a landscape that seems to shift by the day.
The data reflects their hesitation. U.S. ad spending, once projected to grow at a modest clip, is now expected to contract more than previously forecasted. According to Brian Wieser, principal at Madison and Wall, the latest forecast, published today (March 18), places non-political ad spending growth at 3.6% for the year, a notable step down from the 4.5% growth forecast just a few months ago.
“When we made that original forecast back in December there was a pretty negative tone and there were a lot of risks to the downside, albeit with some possibilities to the upside,” said Wieser. “Now, while everything isn’t looking as bad as we feared, a lot is and some things are looking even worse.”
Translation: not “as bad as we feared” remains, in many ways, quite bad. Especially in the second half of the year when the slowdown is expected to take hold, once the full weight of President Donald Trump’s recent policy maneuvers settle in. The first quarter will post 4.0% growth compared to last year, though crucially, that figure comes with an asterisk. It’s being measured against an unusually strong first quarter from the previous year when ad spending surged by 10.5%.
Similar distortions are likely in the months ahead. Comparisons to last year’s figures will reflect a market that, for much of 2023, grew at an unsustainable rate. But that growth, Wieser warned, was a temporary condition. As the factors that had been propping up ad spending — pent up pandemic-era demand, stimulus-fueled consumerism and an overheated digital economy — begin to fade, the numbers will inevitably soften. The most recent earnings season bore that reality out, with CEOs across industries, striking a cautious tone, reflecting on a challenging fourth quarter and offering vague reassurance about the year ahead.
Yet, as Wieser noted, context matters. A 6.0% growth rate in the fourth quarter may appear anemic, but when stacked against Q4 2023’s 11.2% surge, the two-year trend is remarkably stable. The third quarter painted a similar picture: a 9.4% gain, cleanly building upon the previous year’s 7.9% growth. The lesson being that even in a cooling market, advertising remains a fundamentally resilient business.
The problem, of course, is the looming possibility of more persistent negative trends.
“Going into such an uncertain environment with marketers who are more and more short term oriented in how they commit to or refrain from committing to budgets that you’re going to see easing up of ad dollars,” said Wieser.
There’s a broader truth at play — one that predates this particular economic cycle. The events of the past three years have merely accelerated what was already an inevitability: advertising’s return to slow, steady growth after a period of uncharacteristic exuberance. Yes, the industry remains robust, with spending consolidating in key areas and digital channels continuing their steady march forward. But the days of double-digit growth spurts, fueled by the unchecked expansion of programmatic and social media, have ended. The only real surprise is how abruptly the shift arrived. President Trump’s policies were the accelerant.
“An optimist would say that the actions we’ve seen over the past week will be moderated by better judgement, or by the courts or the reaction from the stock markets,” said Wieser. “However, those are willfully optimistic perspectives. I see no evidence to support that view.”
And yet, some constants remain. If advertising has a gravitational center, it is digital media, which continued its upward trajectory through the fourth quarter. By last year’s end, digital platforms had grown 14.2% (including political spending) or 10.9% (excluding it). Search remained a steady force, rising 13.3% for the quarter and 15.8% for the year, while social media continued its strong trajectory by 17.5% in the fourth quarter and 17.4% for the year.
The same can’t be said for TV.
Excluding political ad dollars, television ad revenue slipped 0.9% in the fourth quarter and eked out just 1.7% growth for the year. Any optimism about the modest stability in these numbers was quickly overshadowed by the larger reality: Traditional broadcasters continue to steadily lose growth to the very platforms siphoning ad dollars away from them. Amazon, Netflix and their streaming peers surged ahead, growing by 24% in the fourth quarter and 31% for the year, now accounting for 13% of all national TV ad spending in 2024.
“Successful brands won’t just cut ad spend; they’ll adapt spending towards safer bets — proven strategies and digital media, rather than traditional media buys like TV (which will see significant cuts) due to their lasting resilience,” said Dan Meehan, CEO at ad tech firm PadSquad. “Another avenue that will be tapped into is digital channels with strong(er) measurement capabilities to ensure investments are paying off.”
That recalibration could spell big gains for certain pockets of the market. Commerce media, led primarily by Amazon but also bolstered by Walmart and other retail media players, maintained its momentum with revenues up 14.8% in the fourth quarter and 17.2% for the year. In a market where ad dollars are increasingly scrutinized, platforms that offer clear paths to purchase remain the safest bet.
But in a moment where economic policy feels more like a moving target than a foundation, uncertainty has a way of compounding itself. And when the red pens come out, advertising budgets are among the first to bear the weight of corporate caution.

AI is already taking orders at hundreds of Taco Bell restaurants, and there's more to come from the tech.

        Soon, for example, it might be able to see how many cars are waiting in the drive-thru and suggest items to shorten the wait time, Joe Park, chief digital and technology officer at Yum! Brands, Taco Bell's parent company, told Business Insider.
    

        Right now, ""we just know there's a car at the speaker,"" Park said. Using AI could allow the store to see that there are five cars in line, which could be useful.
    

        ""You might want to suggest selling some quicker-turnover items versus big complex things that might take longer so we can make sure our customers have great speed of service,"" Park said.
    

        Yum! Brands on Tuesday announced a strategic partnership with Nvidia, the chip firm that has cornered most of the market in AI computing.
    

        While Nvidia has become a top tech player by designing the graphics processing units that power most AI, it has also become important in building software that allows less technical companies to harness it.
    

        Nvidia and Taco Bell have already been testing voice AI for ordering at drive-thrus at some locations. The companies say they're looking at whether AI will be useful elsewhere at Yum! restaurants.
    

        Other fast-food chains have also experimented with AI, especially at their drive-thrus. McDonald's rolled out voice AI to drive-thrus at about 100 restaurants with IBM before ending the pilot last year.
    

        However, some McDonald's customers said that the AI tool got their orders wrong in videos posted on social media. The company then pulled the tech, saying that voice AI ""will be part of our restaurants' future.""
    

        Wendy's is adding voice AI to hundreds of restaurants this year. The company says that its system's accuracy is improving, and CEO Kirk Tanner said last month that he personally tests it a few times a week.
    

        Yum! plans to roll out voice ordering to about 500 restaurants, including Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, KFC, and Habit Burger and Grill, starting in the second quarter of 2025, Park said.
    

        Still, Andrew Sun, Nvidia's director of global business development for retail, said several things have to go right for AI to equal the experience of ordering from a human. The quality and speed of the AI models can make the difference between a successful and a frustrating conversation with an AI order-taker.
    

        ""We've all seen what a poor drive-thru experience could look like when it goes viral in a bad way, and we want to make sure our team members have a great experience,"" Park said.
    

        Park said Nvidia's approach of providing a speech-recognition model, a ready-made package of software and tools for specific tasks called microservices, and ongoing support should make the difference.
    

        Yet, ""you're going to have to build relationships with your customers and your team members to have trust in the system and not shut it off,"" he said.
    

        He said an off-the-shelf large language model wouldn't be good enough in a scenario where plenty of menu item names are specific to Taco Bell. For example, Park explained that the AI needs to recognize ""Limonada"" instead of ""Lemonade.""
    

        Improving voice AI's accuracy will involve ""trial and error,"" Park continued.
    

        ""That's such a big unsaid part about AI and getting it to work,"" he added.

GOOG Stock
MCK Stock
 
Google is a tech highflyer. McKesson is no Google. Its profit margins are literally around 1%. But its stock has grown 4x in 5 years, way outpacing Google and Amazon. In this analysis, we try to make sense of that. McKesson’s stock has grown 284% since 2020, mainly because of:
In contrast, Google stock has increased by 92%, fueled by a 174% rise in earnings from $2.93 per share in 2020 to $8.04 per share in 2024, although this growth was somewhat mitigated by a 30% decrease in its trailing P/E ratio from 30x to 21x during the same period.
We will examine these factors in detail. While MCK stock has outpaced GOOG, if you are seeking an upside with a steadier experience than individual stocks, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P and achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception.
McKesson’s earnings have doubled, fueled by significant increases in both sales and operating income. Its revenue grew by nearly 50%, from $231 billion in 2020 to $345 billion today, owing to various strategic factors.
One major factor was McKesson’s pivotal role in COVID-19 response efforts, acting as the U.S. government’s centralized distributor for vaccines, tests, and medical supplies, which significantly boosted revenue during the pandemic. Furthermore, McKesson has deliberately broadened its pharmaceutical distribution business while leveraging the rising demand for specialty pharmaceuticals, especially in oncology and other complex therapeutic areas that usually yield higher margins. Recently, the growth in its pharmaceuticals distribution segment has been driven by higher prescription volumes, particularly for specialty products, national retail accounts, and GLP-1 medications.
The company has also bolstered its market position with strategic acquisitions, such as Rx Savings Solutions, OncoHealth, and a controlling stake in Florida Cancer Specialists & Research Institutes, which have enhanced its offerings in oncology and biopharma services. Moreover, McKesson’s medical-surgical distribution segment has seen strong growth, fueled by persistent demand for medical supplies that emerged during the pandemic and has persisted since.
In addition to the increase in sales, McKesson’s net income grew by 40% from $2.7 billion in 2020 to $3.8 billion currently. However, its net margin contracted by a modest 10 bps to 1.1% over the same period. As McKesson mainly functions as an intermediary between manufacturers and healthcare providers, its business typically operates on thin margins and high volume.
Another factor contributing to earnings growth is the significant 28% reduction in total shares outstanding, as the company repurchased shares worth $13 billion over the past five years.
Since 2020, McKesson’s trailing price-to-earnings ratio has doubled from 11x to 22x, due to several important factors. Investors have reacted favorably to its strategic pivot towards higher-margin sectors, notably specialty pharmaceuticals, oncology services, and technology solutions—a shift that indicates more sustainable profits beyond traditional distribution. This strategic transformation, along with strong revenue and earnings growth, justifies the substantial increase in its valuation multiple.
The company’s outstanding performance is not limited to its valuation. In 2022, while Google fell by over 30%, McKesson recorded gains of more than 50%. This extraordinary performance is driven by its role as a vital component of healthcare infrastructure, making it attractive to investors looking for defensive investments in times of economic uncertainty. Moreover, McKesson’s steady cash generation offers crucial stability during volatile market conditions.
Investors especially acknowledged McKesson’s critical role during the pandemic, emphasizing its significance to public health systems and contributing to its stock price rise in 2022. This resilience has been repeatedly evident during recent economic downturns. MCK stock’s peak-to-trough decline of only 11.0% in 2022 far outperformed the S&P 500’s 25.4% drop. Similarly, during the 2020 market turbulence, McKesson’s stock decreased by 32.3% from its highs, slightly better than the S&P 500’s 33.9% decline, further demonstrating its relative stability in stressful market conditions.
Not satisfied with the volatility of individual stocks? The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over the past four years. How so? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index, offering a smoother ride as reflected in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

59,2025-03-18,"The AMD RX 9070 XT has been hailed as the best graphics card to launch in 2025 — although that’s a low bar to meet. Still, it’s great to have a powerful, somewhat-affordable new card, especially since AMD’s last-generation RX 7000-series GPUs are getting a little long in the tooth. But how does the newly-iconic 9070 XT compare against one of the best last-generation cards (and one of the only still available), the RX 7800 XT?
Here’s how they match up.
The RX 7800 XT launched in September 2023, with a recommend price of $500. It’s sat around that ever since, with some mild fluctuation. It’s one of the few cards to survive the recent price boom in GPUs, too, and you can still find a few 7800 XTs around for between $500 and $600. That’s not amazing value in 2025 when there are newer, faster cards out there, but with stock and pricing problems across the board, it’s arguably not bad.
The 9070 XT launched at the start of March 2025 with a price tag of $600, but it quickly went out of stock, just like everything else launched this year. Unfortunately, that means that the price is all over the place at the time of writing, with the XT model going for anywhere between $700 when it’s in stock, to over $1,000 when paying the scalper’s price.
The specifications of these two cards are intriguing, because on the surface they don’t look that dissimilar. There have similar numbers of shader units and compute units, similarly sized dies, the same memory and memory bus. But it’s when you dig into the details that the differences really stand out.
AMD has managed to pack close to double the transistors into the same size die. That’s doubly impressive since AMD isn’t using a smaller process node this generation. All those transistors allow AMD to double its number of AI accelerators and boost the capabilities of its RT accelerators. It’s also given a lot more power to the core, allowing for much faster boost clocks.
That has resulted in an increase in board power, but only about 17%.
We haven’t had a chance to test the 9070 XT ourselves yet, but taking a look at the benchmark results of these cards in various reviews and tests makes it clear that the 9070 XT is much faster than the 7800 XT. Indeed, AMD’s own graphs suggested it could be as much as 66% faster than the 7900 GRE (though more like 42% on average), which is a card that’s already 10% faster than the 7800 XT.
If we consider a wider spread of games, though, with more of an emphasis on general rasterization rather than raytracing, and don’t factor FSR4 frame generation, the 9070 XT is roughly 35% faster than the 7800 XT, which is a very respectable generational upgrade.
However, it can go much further. With overclocking, we’ve seen the 9070 XT eclipse even the RTX 5080, which is over 65% faster than the 7800 XT, and much, much more expensive than even the 9070 XT’s inflated price tag.
That is dependent on the model of 9070 XT you use, your own system cooling, and your ability to overclock in the first place, but the potential is certainly there for this card to be far faster than it is at stock. While you can overclock the 7800 XT too, it doesn’t have the same headroom as the new card and won’t deliver the same kind of uplift, even in ideal scenarios.
The additional upscaling capabilities of the 9070 XT shouldn’t be discounted, either. The additional AI accelerators and new-generation design makes them much more capable than the 7800 XT in boosting frame rates with FSR and frame generation in compatible games makes a huge difference. The list of supporting games isn’t long at the moment, but it’s growing all the time.
Buying graphics cards in 2025 is not easy. Prices are crazy, stocks are low, and the FOMO is real. But if you can wait out these turbulent times, there’s no question that the 9070 XT is the better card here. It’s much faster, overclocks like mad, has impressive ray tracing performance, and its new upscaling and frame generation capabilities are awesome. Nothing that AMD has ever made before can match it in the right setting.
But don’t discount the 7800 XT just yet. Indeed, if you have one, don’t rush to upgrade it unless you have a very real reason to. It’s still a strong card, and until prices come down, it still offers strong value for money. I wouldn’t necessarily buy one new, but then if you have around $600 to spend, there’s nothing out there that offers that kind of value right now. Prices should come down in the future, but if you need a new card right now, the 7800 XT is still a decent buy.
Well, look at that. AMD actually released a graphics cards that was competitive on price, performance, and features with Nvidia. And it managed to keep enough cards in stock for the launch that it wasn't immediately ruined by scalpers. Although that might seem like a low bar to reach, it's what passes for a success story for GPU launches in 2025, because Nvidia's has been one of the worst we've ever seen.
As exciting as it is that there's a new graphics card that's actually kind of good and worth paying money for, though, it's not time for AMD (or fans) to rest on their laurels. There's more to push for: most notably that prices should come down further.
The RX 9070 is still too expensive
After the way Nvidia's RTX 50-series ended up being called a ""paper launch,"" many breathed a sigh of relief when AMD's RX 9000 series appeared on the shelves in much larger quantities. However, once this initial shipment is sold, AMD could face the same problem as the rest of the best graphics cards: Price hikes, price hikes everywhere.
The cards officially hit the shelves yesterday, and many were spotted far above the recommended list price (MSRP), with some overclocked models priced at up to $250 more than the $600 starting price. However, AMD spoke several times about working with its partners to ensure wide availability at MSRP, and indeed, many retailers had some models up for sale. Those MSRP cards were only around for a short time, though, and they might never come back, according to retailers.
AMD is joining the battle against some of Nvidia's best graphics cards. The RX 9070 XT and its non-XT counterpart should now (hopefully) start flooding the shelves, and gamers are hoping to see them at their recommended list price (MSRP). Unfortunately, some models may cost up to $250 more from the get-go, which is similar to all of Nvidia's recent RTX 50-series releases where the GPUs cost much more than they should.
Although the cards aren't technically up for sale just yet, Best Buy seems to have plenty of RX 9070 XT and non-XT models listed -- they're just marked as ""coming soon.""

61,2025-03-18,"Tesla stock is getting hammered again this week, as shares of the electric vehicle maker led by the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, faced further pressure from Wall Street as Musk grows embedded in the White House and questions swirl about Tesla’s brand reputation globally and its standing in its crucial Chinese market.
Tesla showrooms have faced a spate of protests in recent weeks.
Shares of Tesla dropped 5% to $225.31 Tuesday, building on Monday’s 5% dip as the stock appears poised to decline for a ninth consecutive week.
Tuesday’s drop came as Musk’s firm faced yet another ding from Wall Street analysts.
RBC Capital Markets analyst Tom Narayan cut his price target for Tesla stock by $120 to $320, maintaining his outperform rating for Musk’s company while “rightsizing expectations.”
Narayan cited “intensifying” competition for Tesla in China, which accounted for 21% of Tesla’s 2024 sales, predicting Chinese car companies will “dominate” the market in the country for driverless vehicles, which Musk has emphasized as the future of his company.
Driving down Tesla shares Monday was a note from Mizuho analysts led by Vijay Rakesh lowering their price target for Tesla shares by $85 to a still bullish $430, as the analysts slashed their 2025 vehicle delivery forecast from 2.3 million to 1.8 million, a more than 20% cut that falls well below consensus forecasts of 2 million deliveries.
Rakesh chalked up Tesla’s “sales woes” to weakening “brand perception” in the U.S. and the European Union, a “deterioration in geopolitics” and increasingly challenging competition in China from domestic EV firms.
Two of Tesla’s Chinese EV competitors made major announcements this week which may further weaken Tesla’s positioning in the country. BYD unveiled a new fast charging system which may charge cars in less than a third of the time Tesla’s current chargers allow, while Zeekr said it will offer its self-driving system for free in China. RBC said it expects Tesla’s market share in China to halve to 10%, and relatedly lowered its valuation for Tesla’s full self-driving and robotaxi units from $1.26 trillion to about $850 billion.
Mizuho analysts said Tesla’s U.S. sales last month declined 2% year-over-year as the broader EV market rose by 16%, its China sales cratered 49% as EV sales in the country grew by 85% and its Germany sales tanked 76% as the European nation’s EV market expanded by 31%.
Tesla stock ended Friday trading at its lowest end-of-week level since just before the election. Shares of Tesla are down 44% year-to-date, the worst loss of any company listed on the S&P, according to FactSet data. Mizuho and RBC joined the likes of Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and UBS in slashing its delivery forecasts for Tesla. “We struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly,” Last week, JPMorgan analysts described the recent melting of Tesla’s perception, especially in pockets of the world in which Musk inserted himself into right-wing politics, such as Germany. Though Musk is perhaps the closest ally of President Donald Trump, the latter’s hawkish tariffs are a major drag on Musk’s main source of wealth, Tesla. In a letter to the Office of the United States Trade Representative submitted last Tuesday, Tesla lobbied the Trump administration to take a “phased approach” on tariffs and consider Tesla’s EVs contain “certain parts and components” which “are difficult or impossible to source within the United States,” a break from Trump’s frequently shifting tariff deadlines and targets. About 53% respondents to a CNN poll published last week said they hold a negative opinion of Musk compared to roughly 35% with a positive view and about 11% with no take.
Tesla stock is still up 1% from last Monday, when it suffered a 4.5-year-worst 15% amid a broader selloff tied to economic uncertainty fears linked to Trump’s tariffs.
Musk’s $321 billion net worth makes him easily the richest person on the planet, though that’s down more than $140 billion from its peak of $464 billion set in December when Tesla stock traded at about $480 following a post-election upward swing.

64,2025-03-18,"Junya Watanabe and Cactus Plant Flea Market’s $535 silk scarves were only the beginning. They are only the entry point from which a range of equally loud (and equally pricey) silk bags emerge. 
Toying with the conventions of boldly printed silk scarves, CPFM has added its vast range of motifs to square-shaped scarves made in Japan as part of Watanabe's Spring/Summer 2025 menswear collection: Smiley faces with two sets of eyes, peace symbols, stars, and the like. A typically extensive offering of prints from the American streetwear label.
It’s all very loud and brash in the way that all good CPFM collections tend to be. But the real treasure is in the bags. A backpack and a tote bag, both made entirely from silk, are made to look like they’re patchworked together from a series of silk scarves. 
Mismatched patterns clash with one another, the CPFM branding is printed atop the various intricate silk designs, and it comes together to make a gloriously OTT spectacle. 
Quietly debuted on Watanabe's SS25 menswear runway alongside patchworked together suits and many more collabs, the CPFM collaboration was also released quietly, so quietly that most of its adherents likely didn't even realize they exist.
Exclusive to retailers like Dover Street Market, CPFM x Junya Watanabe is available now, with the backpack retailing for $1,595. Secondhand market aside, that's likely the single most expensive CPFM item to ever be released. 
Junya Watanabe and Cactus Plant Flea Market are two brands whose collaborative output is varied, to say the least. 
At times, the constant outpour of co-branded collections from both parties borders on being erratic. CPFM regularly bounces from merch for Nickelodeon cartoons to collections with sportswear giants while Watanabe dishes wildly pierced sunglasses and technical streetwear. It's a lot to keep up with. 
It's impressive, frankly, that the ultra-collaborative duo is capable of turning out seasonal collections, too.

    Weird doesn't mean bad. Here are some of our favorite strange new smart home appliances you can buy right now.
  
We live in an era where ""dumb"" appliances are going the way of physical media: directly into the landfill of history. Nowadays, if a new gadget isn't smart and doesn't do at least two unexpected things, it often doesn't even get past the R&D stage. One of the knock-on effects of this phenomenon is that the devices and gadgets we see at shows like CES are getting increasingly bizarre, often laden with weird functionality that no one asked for. However, many of these devices never make it to market, so even if you were curious about them, you'll never get the chance to buy them.
That said, there are a handful of these oddities that do sneak through and actually see a commercial release, and some of them are even genuinely useful (optimistically, we'd like to think there's a correlation there). These are some of the craziest, most interesting, smart home gadgets to make it out of the lab and onto store shelves.
Smart fridges have been showing up at CES for so long they've become a cliche, but the good thing about tech cliches is they get iterated on over and over again and, inevitably, some of those iterations are actually convenient.
One of the coolest (pun intended) new features showing up in smart fridges is transparent touchscreens that let you peek inside without having to open the door, like LG's ThinQ InstaView line, which CNET reviewed back in 2016. While at first glance this may seem like a pointless gimmick, not having to open the door to check what you need on your next grocery run can save significant power, and therefore money, over the lifetime of your fridge.
Another cool feature appearing increasingly in smart fridges is customizable temperature zones. These fridges, like this slick model from Fisher and Paykel, can not only keep foods at the perfect serving temperature but can also extend the lifespan of produce by keeping it in an ideal temperature range for preservation.
Hate scooping litter? Whisker's Litter Robot enables you to ditch that chore
""The best part of owning a cat is cleaning the litter box,"" said no-one, ever. Luckily, manufacturers have cottoned onto the fact that dealing with excrement is the worst part of owning a cat, and self-cleaning boxes are becoming more ubiquitous. 
Models like this AI-powered box from CatGenie not only automatically flush away waste, they wash and dry litter granules, saving you money on cat litter over time. Other options, like PetSafe's SmartSpin, go a step further and can track metrics about your cat's health, like how often they're using the box and their weight, and report directly to an app.
CNET's Ry Crist also loved the Whisker Litter-Robot 4, praising the easy setup, helpful app and automatic sifting and cat sensing, though it doesn't work well for cats that weigh less than three pounds and costs a princely $699. 
By now, you've surely heard of exercise mirrors that can guide you through a workout and track your fitness progress, but what about one that can analyze your skincare routine and give you real-time tips on applying your makeup? 
No longer exclusively the domain of dystopian science fiction, smart mirrors like Capstone's Connected model not only feature a touchscreen and voice interface options, but can even download and run discreet apps over Wi-Fi. 
You can overlay a YouTube makeup tutorial from your favorite MUA influencer while you listen to music and check your Insta, all from the comfort of your bathroom sink top. Instead of fumbling with your phone while you're trying to apply mascara, the latest smart mirrors let you check the weather or traffic on your route to work completely hands-free.
The K-Cafe Smart can do much more than your average single serve coffee maker.
But why stop at checking the weather? If you also want to start brewing your coffee while you're in the midst of your morning bathroom routine, the latest smart coffee makers have you covered. 
Take the Specialty Drip Coffee Maker from Café, which not only includes voice-to-brew technology but also packs in fun extra features like the ability to customize brew strength, a smart filtration system and an app that allows to start brewing coffee even when you're on your way home. 
If a truly high-end brew is more your speed, consider the Miele Milk Perfection 6360 smart espresso maker. While it's a premium-priced, high-end appliance, the 6360 justifies its price tag with granular options like the ability to adjust brew strength either by the coarseness of the grind of the quantity of coffee used for a shot. It also lets you store up to eight of your favorite specialty drinks so you can brew them up with the touch of a single button and can also make hot water for teas at four different temperatures customized for different varieties of teas. 
Naturally, it comes with app support for nearly all of its features, so you can savor a taste of Italian excellence without ever stooping to physically touching a coffee machine like a plebe.
The Breville Mini Smart Oven had my favorite display out of the bunch.
Not to be outdone by their cooling counterparts over on the smart fridge side, new smart ovens are bringing the heat by making almost every step of meal preparation easier. While they haven't (yet) invented a model with arms that will pre-assemble the food for you, ovens like the Brava Smart Oven are like ten appliances packed into one compact countertop chassis. 
They not only let you choose between baking, roasting, air-frying, toasting and a plethora of other options for applying heat to organic material, they can even guide you through recipes, one step at a time. The era of looking at your phone or (shudder to think) flipping through an actual hardcopy recipe book are over, and the Brava Smart Oven's screen reader option means laudable accessibility for the blind or visually impaired. Also, similar to some smart fridge's adjustable temperature zone, ovens like the Brava model let you cook multiple ingredients, each requiring different temps or cook times, all at the same time. 
So, remember how I said they haven't invented a smart oven with arms yet? The same can't be said for robot vacuums, where Roborock has brought the retro-future that children's cartoons have been predicting for 60 years. 
Meet the Saros Z70, a robot vacuum with a retractable five-axis mechanical arm. This OmniGrip arm can move small objects out of the vacuum's way, pick up trash and debris and even lift items like slippers so that the vacuum can clean underneath them. When CNET saw the demo at CES 2025, we liked the feature so much that we gave it our Best of CES Award. It's not available for sale yet, but by all indications, Roborock does plan on bringing it to market. 
We also liked the Dreame X50 Ultra robot vacuum, which can deploy a pair of legs to clear small barriers up to 2.36 inches. Our team at CNET Lab is currently hard at work testing it on an obstacle course, but you can currently already buy it for $1,699 if you don't want to wait. 
If you're the sort of type-A personality that worries about wasted time on the toilet, fret no more. A smart and productive bathroom experience, only the purchase of a smart toilet, smart shower and smart sink away. Of these, the smart toilet is definitely the one that catches our attention. 
The modern smart toilet doesn't just include pedestrian features like self-cleaning; many, like the Numi from Kohler can connect to Alexa or other smart assistants to allow you to create the perfect, soothing environment or adjust settings like the strength of the built-in bidet wand. You can modify everything from the type of spray, water pressure and temperature and even pulse and oscillation strength for either front or rear washing.
If that's not enough, the Numi includes hands-free lid and seat control, and even the ability to craft a customized light and soundscape with up to five presets, so each member of your household can make every trip to the bathroom an immersive escape from the vicissitudes of modern life.
A smart home isn't complete without a smart kitchen. Our countertop appliances include the June Intelligent Oven, which can be controlled by Alexa. Also available is the Hestan Cue, a smart induction cooktop that teaches you how to cook, 
The proliferation of weird gives us hope for the future of the smart home landscape which, if things go well, won't fall victim to the kind of homogenization and zero-risk, all-vanilla strategies we see in some other sectors of tech. With the AI ""renaissance"" we're currently in the grips of, and continuing developments in robotics, we've closer than ever to a world where we're never required to go physically into the kitchen again. 
In the meantime, we're blessed by the fact that more and more of the strangest ideas ever to haunt the CES show floor are actually making it to store shelves, so get out there and buy weird."

NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JULY 11: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on ... [+] July 11, 2024 in New York City. Prediction markets currently see a 40% risk of recession in 2025. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)
Prediction markets imply a 40% chance of recession in 2025. Reported economic data has been generally positive, so far. However, forward-looking indicators, including the stock market, suggest risks may be on the horizon. Here’s what the data is telling us, so far.
Despite recession predictions, recent key economic data has been generally good. Q4 annualized gross domestic product grew at a healthy 2.3% rate on the most recent estimate. That’s a sufficiently strong reading, that there’s room for growth to decline yet remain above recessionary levels. Unemployment, too, has been relatively stable at 4.1% for February. Of course, these data are subject to revision, but appear encouraging.
However, it’s also clear that consumers are worried. In February, consumer confidence fell to levels that can signal a recession ahead, according to Conference Board reports. Retail sales data has been mixed, with a soft January although February was a little more encouraging. Both Delta and American Airlines have cut their growth expectations recently on early signs of softer travel demand. The Challenger Report suggests a high rate of job cuts, particularly in government, not all of which may be in the unemployment data yet.
Perhaps most importantly the stock market, having fallen over 10% is now in correction territory. The stock market is volatile, stock market corrections are more frequent than recessions. Nonetheless, recessions when they do occur are generally accompanied by declines in the stock market.
Much of the economic concern centers on the impact of tariffs. We haven’t seen much reported data yet, given timing lags. However, the drop in consumer confidence appears, in part, due to a concern that tariffs will slow the economy. That could occur if tariffs result in general price rises that slow economic activity.
However, there are other moving parts to consider. For example, tariffs appear to have caused unusual swings in trade flows. For example, the Atlanta Federal Reserve’s GDPNow model is calling for negative growth in Q1. Part of that is due to unusually large gold imports that will be excluded from actual Q1 GDP growth. Even with that adjustment, the model is implying slowing growth compared to Q4. The New York Fed’s Nowcast is much more optimistic, estimating Q1 growth at over 2%.
Currently, there are more estimates that economic growth will slow, than hard data showing a slowdown has occurred. Of course, the pessimism may be self-fulfilling and past economic data could be subject to negative recession.
Nonetheless, if a 2025 recession occurs in the traditional pattern, then expect to see increasing unemployment in upcoming reports. Typically, a 0.5% absolute rise in unemployment is associated with a recession, and thus far, unemployment has been broadly flat to February. For now, the assessment appears to be and elevated chance of recessio, but with limited hard data to confirm one will occur at this point."
68,2025-03-18,"The Leica Q3 43 has been out of stock at a lot of retailers outside of Leica stores since its launch back in October of last year. B&H Photo now has limited stock of this brillaint fixed lens full-frame camera from Leica.
The Q series has been the best line of products in the Leica lineup since it was launched nearly a decade ago in my opinion. I do have a thing for the red dot, even if I don’t own anything outside of a Q series camera and some binoculars from Leica.
The latest Leica Q3 43 uses a Summicron 43mm f/2 lens instead of the Summilux 28mm f/1.7 on all of the previous Leica Q cameras. Both lenses are brilliant as you would expect.
A first for the Q series, the Leica Q3 43 is the same powerful and portable camera but now touts a longer APO-Summicron 43mm f/2 ASPH. lens.
Built for those looking for more reach rather than a wider field of view, this sibling of the original Q3 is better positioned for portrait photographers and everyday shooters looking for a narrower, more natural perspective compared to the 28mm lens of the original.
Beyond the lens and some aesthetic differences on the camera body, the Q3 43 remains functionally the same as the Q3: it includes the high-performance 60MP full-frame sensor, hybrid AF system, 8K video recording, and refined handling design that made the original Q3 version a versatile all-in-one choice for a variety of shooting needs.

Map of Greenland and Iceland
What does a pharmaceutical company have to do with U.S. national security? Perhaps more than meets the eye, based on President Trump’s negotiating style, which often involves utilizing leverage to weaken the other side’s bargaining position. In the case at hand, President Trump has repeatedly expressed an interest in acquiring Greenland from Denmark for reasons involving national security.
To pursue his goal, one tactic may involve loosening existing regulations to encourage more competition in order to pressure Denmark’s largest company. Trickle down effects may influence Denmark’s willingness to deal.
To provide some context, consider that the U.S. is home to the five largest companies in the world: Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Nvidia and Amazon are combined worth more than $13 trillion, close to half of the U.S. gross domestic product. Along with two other companies (Meta and Tesla), they accounted for more than 50% of stock market gains in 2024.
Each of these companies matters a great deal to the U.S. economy: they drive innovation, are major employers and contribute to the tax base.
Yet perhaps no company is more important to its country than Novo Nordisk. At $355 billion, its market capitalization is close to Denmark’s entire GDP. Half of Denmark’s economic growth in 2023 was driven by Novo Nordisk, which is also the country’s largest taxpayer.
To understand how federal healthcare regulation and policy could impact Novo Nordisk and Denmark, and why five other health technology developments matter, read on.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration updated its drug shortage list on Feb. 21 and marked semaglutide, the active ingredient in GLP-1 drugs Wegovy and Ozempic, as resolved. This follows the FDA’s decision to remove tirzepatide, the active ingredient in GLP-1 drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound, from the drug shortage list in December.
While the issue may seem esoteric, the impact is anything but.
Initially indicated for diabetes, GLP-1 drugs such as Wegovy and Ozempic are now popularly known for driving impressive weight loss results. A recent Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that 30 million Americans have taken a GLP-1 drug.
Normally the profits of such a blockbuster pharmaceutical go to the manufacturer, which enjoys patent protection for a period of time. During a drug shortage, however, qualified pharmacies are allowed to compound (mix) versions of the drug, using available ingredients. Because these compounded drugs are generic, they can be offered at whatever price the pharmacy determines, which can be hundreds of dollars less per month than the brand version, even when patients have insurance.
Over the past couple of years, thousands of pharmacies and telehealth companies have been compounding generic versions of Wegovy and Ozempic. Some, such as Hims & Hers, have built hugely successful businesses, generating $100+ million of revenue off of these products.
Now that the shortage has been officially resolved, Novo Nordisk, the manufacturer of Wegovy and Ozempic, is eager to convert every patient on a compounded drug to its own brand. On its earnings call last month, Novo’s executive vice president said, “I want to remind everyone that we do not supply compounding, and we have significant actions in place to curtail this.”
Hims stock dropped 15% when the FDA shortage was removed. But the company appears to be betting that it can continue compounding semaglutide; personalization is the watchword. “There may be the potential to offer commercially available dosages of compounded semaglutide throughout the year…Personalized semaglutide dosages [an allowed form of compounding] will supplement these core offerings for the subset of consumers for whom it is a clinical necessity,” Hims Chief Financial Officer Yemi Okupe explained in the company’s latest earnings call.
The conflict between compounders like Hims and pharmaceutical companies like Novo Nordisk is playing out against the backdrop of the Trump Administration’s foreign policy efforts. In this case, Hims’ and others’ success comes at Novo Nordisk’s expense.
Notably, Hims donated $1 million to President Trump’s inauguration fund in January of this year.
What will be interesting to watch is how the Trump administration, via the FDA and other regulatory agencies, approaches policing and enforcement efforts of compounded GLP-1 drugs. With Novo Nordisk’s stock down 40% over the past year, will the Trump administration pursue lax enforcement of drug compounders in order to exert pressure on a huge driver of Denmark’s economy?
Teladoc has had a challenging start to 2025. The ~$2.5 billion revenue virtual care company was accused in a Feb. 18 report by short seller Blue Orca of incentivizing its mental health therapists to use AI in communicating with its patients. According to the report, the company compensates its BetterHelp therapists in part based on the volume of words they use in asynchronous communications with their patients, creating an incentive system in which therapists have motivation to use AI to respond more quickly and at length to more patients.
At the heart of the matter are two immediate questions: 1. Are BetterHelp therapists sharing confidential patient information with a third party for purposes of training its AI models; and 2. Regardless of whether the AI is created by a third party or not, does BetterHelp risk breaching its patients’ trust if it is fostering a culture in which efficiency and productivity are prioritized over patient trust?
Teladoc has said it has policies in place that prohibit sharing personal health information with third parties, and it has pushed back on other aspects of Blue Orca’s report including noting that Blue Orca is a short seller with its own incentives. (Also notable is Blue Orca’s slim website with little information about its founder Soren Aandahl or why its principal place of business is the Cayman Islands).
The company’s stock was down 10% on the Blue Orca news and dropped again following a disappointing Q4 earnings call on Feb. 26.
The recent downswing comes after six months of progress for the company in terms of stock performance.
Teladoc’s operational and strategic concerns go far beyond the use of AI (or not) by its clinicians. The Blue Orca report is likely akin to a shark smelling blood in the water, probably an effect rather than cause of Teladoc’s challenges. But an interesting longer term trend for both the company and other providers to watch is, first, whether the Blue Orca report spurs media to look at how providers use AI in patient interactions and how patients react, and second, how these stories will impact the way providers think about incorporating AI into their care delivery models.
President Trump issued an executive order on Feb. 25 to promote price transparency in healthcare. This executive order follows price transparency requirements for both hospitals and health plans established in the first Trump administration that raised questions, noted Jeffrey Davis, director at McDermott+, in an email.
What’s unclear is what exactly is new about the recent executive order. “Hospitals and health plans already must comply with definitive reporting requirements, and CMS has already issued guidance on the requirements and taken enforcement actions. However, it is apparent that the Trump administration wants to do more, including issuing more regulations,” explained Davis.
One thing that does seem clear: price transparency is likely to receive more attention, more compliance monitoring and more enforcement action under the new administration. That may mean increased penalties for non-compliance and more targeted requirements for actual (not estimated) prices, along with the potential for expanded scope to include things such as prescription drugs.
Turquoise Health, a health technology company providing price transparency tools for institutions and price shopping services for consumers, sees the executive action as a boon for the public. “This will help ensure a more consistent experience for consumers and employers, while facilitating competition amongst providers and insurers,” notes Chris Severn, cofounder and CEO at Turquoise Health.
If we want a system that is more responsive to consumerism, this executive order may be an important start. Price discoverability is a defining feature of how markets function; without it, demand and supply do not know where to meet. Which seems apropos of how our healthcare system currently operates.
Industry newcomers might look to technology for innovation in healthcare. But it is often business model innovation that brings real changes.
It is with this in mind that two digital health companies announced substantial capital raises in early 2025. OpenEvidence raised $75 million at a $1 billion valuation from lead investor Sequoia Capital. What’s more novel than the company’s chatbots for doctors (which many others also offer) is that 1. the product is free to doctors, 2. adoption has grown largely through organic word of mouth and product-led growth motions, and 3. the company makes money through advertising.
Hippocratic AI also became a unicorn in January, raising $141 million in a Series B round. Hippocratic offers AI nurse agents to help health systems handle routine, non-diagnostic care interactions with patients. Rather than selling its technology as enterprise software, however, the company sells its AI agents on an hourly fee basis. At a reported $9 per hour, Hippocratic’s AI nurses are dramatically less expensive than the $89 fully loaded cost of a full time nurse or per diem nurse.
By pricing its technology on an hourly usage basis, Hippocratic AI seems to be positioning itself to appeal to budget-minded nursing executives and/or the finance department. It will be interesting to see whether the company gains real traction in the market, as its efforts may pit raw economic incentives against a clinician workforce anxious about how AI may affect their jobs.
It is the best of times, it is the worst of times, it is the age of power, it is the age of scrutiny, we all benefit from, we all suffer as a result of — in short, it is all these things for the largest pharmacy benefit managers.
On the one hand, incumbent PBMs have never been better positioned. PBMs manage prescriptions for more than 275 million Americans. And with no more publicly traded PBMs, there is less reporting and transparency, so it’s difficult for outsiders to scrutinize. When PBM services are shared, the results are impressive, as CVS Health’s Health Services division (of which its PBM makes up the vast majority) reported operating income of $6.9 billion in 2024.
On the other hand, after dropping efforts to reign in PBM business practices at the end of 2024, a bipartisan group of senators has just been reported to be reintroducing a bill aiming to do just that. This follows the Federal Trade Commission’s interim report in July 2024 which found that the top three PBMs controlled about 80% of prescription claims and wield substantial power and influence over drug price and availability, and cited evidence of self-dealing. States are getting in on the action as well, with every state enacting at least one law (and more than 150 total) addressing PBM behavior since 2016.
More recently, a federal court ordered CVS Health to provide additional documents with FTC’s ongoing investigation.
“It matters because of the inherent conflicts of interest that come with a PBM making money on drug spend through mail order or at a retail pharmacy, for example. The more expensive a medication is, the worse the optics are if a traditional PBM earns a spread,” explained AJ Loiacano, CEO of Capital Rx, which provides technology and infrastructure to help employers and other payers to manage their own pharmacy benefits.
Another challenger to the PBM status quo agrees about the importance. Chris Blackley is CEO of Prescryptive, a PBM offering transparent pricing and novel consumer technology to empower individual decisions. Blackley highlights the FTC’s investigation as critical because it can bring transparency and help lead to reforms.
“Ultimately, promoting competition in the PBM market could be the ‘cure’ for the systemic issues plaguing drug pricing,” noted Blackley.
Beyond more competition, Loiacano suggests watching how America’s largest employers and payers act can serve as a signal of whether real change is coming. Last year, Blue Shield of California stopped using CVS’s Caremark as its PBM, instead relying on five separate partners. Will more big names follow suit in 2025?
Acronyms can be a mouthful, and the Biden Administration may have inadvertently caused a choking incident last year when it restructured ONC and gave it new responsibilities, creating the new ASTP/ONC (Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy/Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology).
ASTP/ONC is effectively the federal agency that regulates health technology. Esoteric yes, but impactful because of the weight it has with health technology vendors used by more than 90% of providers and hospitals in the country. Among other things, ASTP/ONC’s mission is to enable health information exchange between technology systems, providers and patients. The hope is that one day when tricorders are used and purveyors of longevity miracles have long since passed, faxes will no longer be needed in healthcare.
With changing administrations comes shifting priorities, however. The Trump administration’s suspension of health tech advisory meetings and overall modus operandi has left industry insiders wondering about the course of important policy decisions that will affect the industry, clinicians and patients.
“I believe that the new Trump administration has big plans for health data, and ASTP/ONC will likely be part of that,"" explained Lisa Bari, CEO of Civitas Network for Health, a national nonprofit whose members are regional and state health information networks, “but there will likely be a lot of restructuring of scope and responsibilities.”
One of the big open questions facing Steve Posnack (recently named acting head of ASTP/ONC) is how to proceed with the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement. TEFCA is the government’s effort to provide one national on-ramp for providers (and maybe individuals) to request and exchange records.
Many important questions remain open regarding TEFCA. The governance structure. How conflicts will be handled. Privacy and security questions.
Some are skeptical. “I think the innate challenges of TEFCA…. People are starting to appreciate them,” said Don Rucker, former head of ONC, last week at the HIMSS conference. Rucker went on to question whether TEFCA conforms to existing privacy protections for individuals.
Michael Westover, vice president of data partnerships and informatics at Providence St. Joseph Health, is hopeful about TEFCA but likewise has questions. Among others, he raises how patients’ perspectives will be voiced and whether there will be conflicts of interest or self-dealing among the Governing Council.
Large technology vendors including Epic and Oracle have signaled support for TEFCA, but it is unclear how far industry can proceed without federal guidance on so many open issues. ASTP/ONC’s actions and the administration’s messages in the coming months are worth paying attention to.
Even in the past few days, events continue to unfold at a dizzying pace. An IPO filing from tech-enabled provider Hinge Health is buoying industry hopes that a successful exit encourages more investment in health technology. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced the early termination of eight experimental payment models.
Stress and anxiety often accompany periods of substantial change and upheaval. But for a $4.9 trillion healthcare system where 25% of our spend is wasteful, change isn’t necessarily a bad thing. For that matter, if the Trump administration reduced a substantial chunk of that wasteful spend, perhaps those savings could help fund a deal with Denmark for Greenland."

Elon Musk paid out more than $200 million to help get Donald Trump reelected in November. In the weeks following Trump’s victory, Musk more than made that back. In fact, he became the first person ever worth $400 billion in December, after private investors valued his startup xAI at $50 billion (up from $24 billion in May) and Musk’s rocket maker SpaceX at $350 billion (up from $210 billion in June). That same month, public shareholders drove Tesla’s market capitalization to an all-time high of $1.5 trillion.
Then things started to slowly unravel. Tesla’s stock hit a speed bump in early January, after the company reported weaker than expected deliveries for the fourth quarter of 2024. But Tesla shares started really recoiling on January 21, the day after President Trump’s inauguration, when Musk took over as head of Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Worries over Musk’s ability to run the car company while working around the clock figuring out ways to slash federal government spending have sent the stock crashing down 50% from its high.
“In a nutshell the word ‘balance’ has been missing with Elon Musk and his ability to run Tesla as CEO....while instead focusing all of his energy and time driving his DOGE initiative within the Trump Administration,” wrote Tesla bull Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities in a recent analyst report, while also noting that the EV maker’s numbers have been soft as of late.
On January 29, Tesla reported that its revenue grew a disappointing 1% to $97.7 billion during 2024, while its net income fell for the second straight year to $8.4 billion. Meanwhile, reports have emerged of dramatic declines in Tesla car sales in the first two months of 2025 in Germany, China and Australia, and analysts at JPMorgan recently cut their global deliveries forecast for the first quarter of 2025 to their lowest level since the third quarter of 2022. At the same time, protests against Tesla and Musk have erupted at Tesla dealerships across the US.
Perhaps it’s not much of a surprise then that Musk launched an official appeal a week ago of a ruling out of Delaware in January 2024 that voided the record-breaking Tesla pay package he was granted in 2018. The judge in the case ruled that Musk and Tesla failed to prove that the process underlying the award was fair due to conflicts of interest and Musk’s “control” over the board. Forbes has discounted the underlying stock options from the pay package (worth $65.3 billion as of Monday’s market close) by 50% pending the results of Musk’s appeal. Excluding those options, Musk owns a 12% stake in Tesla worth $97.8 billion, though he’s pledged more than half his shares to secure personal loans of up to $3.5 billion.
With Tesla crashing, SpaceX is now Elon Musk’s most valuable asset for the first time in five years. Forbes estimates that Musk’s 42% stake in his rocket maker is now worth $147 billion–nearly $20 billion more than his Tesla stock and options as of Monday’s market close. The last time Musk’s SpaceX stake was worth more than his Tesla stock and options in 2019, Musk’s entire fortune was only worth about $20 billion. SpaceX, which launches satellites, cargo and astronauts into orbit for government and commercial customers, grew its revenue by 51% to $13.1 billion in 2024, according to estimates by industry analysts Payload Space, with estimated revenue from SpaceX’s Starlink satellite internet service nearly doubling to $8.2 billion.
While SpaceX and Tesla still make up more than 80% of Musk’s estimated $329 billion net worth, he also owns smaller stakes in xAI, X Corp (formerly Twitter), tunnelling startup Boring Company and brain implant firm Neuralink. Together those holdings add another $45 billion to Musk’s fortune.
Musk has acknowledged the “great difficulty” of juggling DOGE and his roles overseeing six different companies. Still, he hasn’t given up on his EV maker just yet, declaring in an X post last Monday that Tesla will “be fine long-term.” After all, despite its recent slump, the company’s stock is still up 46% over the last year, and Musk is still the world’s richest person."

Despite releasing back in November 2024, AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D has been difficult to track down in the US and the UK, and the few listings that were available were typically above the list price of the high-end gaming CPU.
However, it seems those stock issues have now been remedied, and the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D is now widely available in the US from trusted retailers such as Amazon and Best Buy for its original price of $479 / £449. Don't miss your chance to pick up the best processor for gaming available under $500 while you can.
We previously reported that the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D was nearly impossible to find back in December 2024, and that remained the case throughout Q1 2025, until now. Stock woes were so disappointing that we previously recommended prospective buyers consider alternatives like the previous-generation Ryzen 7 7800X3D and the Intel Core i9-14900K. While solid offerings, they can't quite do what this second-generation AM5 chip can for gamers, especially as Team Blue's chip costs over $100 more and was little more than a mild bump over over the 13900K.
We've loved the Ryzen 7 9800X3D since we first tested it back in November 2024, giving it a near-perfect 4.5-star write-up, citing it as a ""gaming powerhouse"" and ""the best gaming processor on the market"" despite an increased price and power draw compared to its previous-generation equivalent.
With its eight cores (16 threads) and 96MB of AMD's 3D V-cache (L3 cache) stacked onto the chip, combined with its 120W TDP, the 9800X3D boasts some incredible gaming performance even on par with some of Intel's highest-end chips while using half the power. Taking gaming averages into consideration, it runs rings around the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K and AMD Ryzen 7950X for price-to-performance that cannot be beaten. Simply put, this is the AM5 chip to get if you're serious about gaming.
After being nearly impossible to find back during its launch window in November 2024, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is now widely available in the US from retailers such as Amazon and Best Buy for MSRP. Patience pays off, as this chipset boasts price-to-performance for gamers that even pricier processors cannot claim. 
Also available at Best Buy
Available in the UK from Amazon and Curry's for £478.99. 
If you've been eyeing up the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D for some time but couldn't find one for MSRP then we strongly advise you to act sooner rather than later to avoid disappointment. The chipset was ephemeral at release three months ago and there's no guarantee it'll hang around at the sticker price for the foreseeable future.
For as much as we love the higher-end Ryzen 9950X3D that was released last week, we would still recommend that gamers go for the cheaper 9800X3D instead. That's because the leading chip has diminishing returns for those wanting the best gaming performance possible (especially for the $220 / £250 price increase). While it has more under the hood for creatives and workflow, its benefits are less apparent even in demanding titles.

Apple has lost an appeal in Germany on how much it dominates the smartphone market, and is now staring down antitrust penalties in the country on top of everything else it faces in the European Union. As such, Apple is now subject to penalties in accordance with anti-competition law in Germany. On Tuesday, judges from the Federal Court of Justice issued a ruling after a one-month deliberation, declaring that Apple should be applied additional controls to encourage competition in the German market. Presiding judge Wolfgang Kirchhoff said that an assessment has shown that Apple has too much control across multiple markets, and should be subjected to additional controls, reports Reuters. Apple's legal team asked for the court to discuss the matter with the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg ahead of making a decision, on the belief that EU and German law don't necessarily line up. Judge Kirchhoff said the judges failed to see any grounds for such contact to be made.Federal judges ruled that Apple's 2023 designation as a ""company of paramount cross-market significance for competition"" stands. Controls and fines are likely as a result of the ruling. Exactly how harsh the penalties will be remains to be seen.Competition checksThe lawsuit was instigated by the Bundeskartellamt in April 2023, with the regulator believing that Apple was subject to a 2021 amendment to the German Competition Act. Section 19a of the act, which came into force in January 2019, adds more controls and checks for companies that are seen as breaking German antitrust law. Following the addendum, the regulator was quick to start an investigation using its new powers into the App Store and Apple's activities. With control of iOS and the App Store, Apple therefore ""holds a key position for competition,"" according to German law.Apple's lawsuit aimed to defeat the regulator's original decision, and therefore allow Apple to operate without the extra checks to prohibit anti-competitive practices. The designation will stand until April 2028. The legal fight is also separate from the regulator's other Apple-related activities. In June 2022, it launched an antitrust investigation into Apple over App Tracking Transparency, specifically complaints that ATT rules that applied to third-party app producers didn't apply to Apple itself. Germany's activity also follows after years of attempts by the EU and other governments to curtail the power of tech giants in the marketplace.  The most recent attempt are the Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act, a set of rules to try and force gatekeepers to act in a competition-promoting way. This included forcing Apple into allowing third-party App Store alternatives onto the iPhone in the EU, and eliminating anti-steering rules. Changes that Apple dragged its heels over, but eventually relented in some cases.

Anti-competition... The iPhone market is still less than the android market. Does Germany even try and make and sell mobile devices? I believe they do but the market simply doesn't want them in any quantity. Germany suing Apple doesn't help Germany make their own devices, it simply makes them money off the back of other companies. The EU cartel is the same thing. If you can't make something people want you sue the company that people like. This isn't an antitrust lawsuit, it's simply a money grab because Germany no longer makes products people want to buy and use. --Look at what's happening with its automobile market, it's tanking. Will Germany sue other car companies because they no longer can keep up with technology and the desires of consumers?

Apple has been ruled non-compliant on competition grounds. It isn't a 'money grab' nor does it have anything to do with the Android market or anything else you bring up. The Germans aren't making the laws up as they go. There was an investigation and a ruling. Apple presented its case. That is how it works. Maybe Apple can appeal. I don't know.

Money grab, shakedown, pick your favorite term because that's exactly what it is and this is how a corrupt Europe operates now.And, of course, the bitter irony in many of these cases is that these ""Western Democracies"", supposed bastions of freedom, are going after Apple for protecting freedom and privacy.

78,2025-03-18,"Hims & Hers (HIMS+8.07%), the millennial-skewed telehealth company, saw its stock tumble nearly 9% on Tuesday, as the company braces for big regulatory shifts in the weight-loss drug industry.
Hims stock took a hit just a day after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) updated a page on its website outlining its concerns with the use of what it calls “unapproved GLP-1 drugs.” GLP-1 drugs are a class of drugs, made popular by Novo Nordisk’s (NVO-2.46%) Ozempic, which mimic hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite. 
The FDA warned Monday that the use of unapproved versions of these drugs including compounded versions can “be risky for patients, as unapproved versions do not undergo FDA’s review for safety, effectiveness and quality before they are marketed.” 
Back in May, Hims & Hers started selling compounded semaglutide — the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and Wegovy — for just $199 a month. That’s a big difference compared to Ozempic’s $1,000 list price and Wegovy’s $1,349 price tag. Compounding means a pharmacy or physician customizes an approved drug to fit an individual patient’s needs. The company’s total sales grew 69% last year to $1.5 billion.
Hims & Hers was able to sell this off-brand version because of recent shortages of GLP-1 drugs. Normally, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits making drugs that are just copies of commercially available ones. However, when drugs are in shortage, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn’t consider them commercially available.
Now that the Ozempic shortage is over, Hims & Hers will have to stop selling “essential copies” of compounded semaglutide this year.
The FDA said it will start citing companies and healthcare providers that continue to offer “essential copies” of compounded semaglutide starting May 22 or after a judge rules on a lawsuit from the industry group Outsourcing Facilities Association — whichever comes later.
“We will have to start notifying customers in the coming month or two that they will need to start looking for alternative options on the commercial dosing,” Hims & Hers CEO Andrew Dudum told investors during a call in  February.
Still, Hims & Hers has other avenues to explore. The company could continue to offer more personalized semaglutide formulations and shift its focus to older generic weight-loss drugs.
Additionally, on Tuesday Bank of America Securities (BAC+1.91%) analyst Allen Lutz adjusted the firm’s price target for Hims & Hers by $1 to $22 — notably $12 below the stock’s opening price that day. Lutz maintained an “underperform” (sell) rating.
Lutz noted that while overall sales grew 124% year over year in February, GLP-1 medications now make up about 45% of the company’s online revenue. Meanwhile, growth outside of GLP-1s has slowed, with core sales increasing just 30% in February — down from 40% in the fourth quarter and 47-50% in the third.
“Slowing core growth is an important barometer as semaglutide could exit the model at any time and now represents close to 50% of sales,” Lutz wrote.

79,2025-03-18,"Months after announcing a plan to bring the Pebble back, Eric Migicovsky’s new company, Core Devices, is showing off specs and images and opening up pre-orders.
Migicovsky, founder of Pebble, still wears the eponymous smartwatch he created back in 2013. Launched as a Kickstarter campaign, Pebble developed an audience of loyal enthusiasts. The company made smartwatches for a niche of people who traded features like health tracking, color touchscreens, and premium materials for something more affordable with a black-and-white display and physical buttons that could last for days instead of hours. An open SDK allowed developers to make all sorts of apps not allowed on other smartwatch platforms. It was simpler, and practical.
But Pebble eventually collapsed after the company, as Migicovsky said in an interview, âlost the core vision of what made a Pebble a Pebbleâ and found itself âkind of flipping around in the wind, reacting to what we thought the market was calling for.â Pebble shut down in 2016 and sold its assets to Fitbit, and afterwards Migicovsky said he never found another smartwatch with the exact same suite of features he wanted.
After all these years, he is bringing back the beloved smartwatch under a new company, aptly called Core Devices. Its first two smartwatches became available for pre-order on Tuesday, and Pebble lovers will be glad to know they largely stick to the original design and aesthetic with some key improvements.
âWe’re keeping the core things the same,â said Migicovsky. âLike, what makes a Pebble a Pebble? It’s the e-paper screen, long battery life with a clean, simple aesthetic, kinda quirky physical buttons.â On the continued use of buttons, which automakers have been removing to the chagrin of many drivers: âYou wanna be able to answer a call or hang up on a call without actually looking down at the screen or pressing play or pause when you’re on the line.â And the watches from Pebble were hackable, âin a way that no other smartwatch is.â
Core 2 Duo (not to be mistaken with the Intel chipset) is said to look and feel just like the Pebble 2, but now with battery life of up to thirty days on a charge, a massive leap from the seven days the earlier watch could get. Migicovsky attributes that to improvements in Bluetooth chip efficiency over the past ten years. âIt’s the stress of having to remember all chargers and everything. That’s always a problem,â he said. âSo that’s one thing that we’ve improved. You can go on basically the longest vacation you can think of and still not bring your charger on the trip.â
The Core 2 Duoâthe âDuoâ stands for âdo-overââwill also have a speaker and microphone as well as sleep and step tracking in a polycarbonate frame. It will cost $149, with an initial production run of approximately 10,000 units available on day one. Shipping begins in July.
The other watch, Core Time 2, is Migicovsky’s “dream watch,” featuring a metal frame and, for the first time, a color reflective LCD touchscreen. He conceded that although buttons are great because you do not need to look at the watch to control it, he likes the complications feature on Apple Watch, and wanted to offer something similar. Wearers will be able to see information from apps directly from the watchface, and tap the complications to go directly into apps. The Core Time 2 will cost $225 and shipping begins in December. Like the Core 2 Duo the company claims it should last about 30 days on a charge. In another departure from the Core 2 Duo, the Core Time 2 also includes a heart rate monitor and should be water resistant.
The software and app marketplace will largely be identical to the Pebble lineup, after Migicovsky convinced Google to open source PebbleOS. Google took over Pebbleâs assets with its acquisition of Fitbit. A roughly combined 10,000 apps and watchfaces that were available on the older Pebble watches will be supported.
Pebble fanatics have a lot to like here. The brand is not being exploited to chase new trendsâthis is not an AI companion like the now-defunct Humane Ai Pin. Though a microphone on the watches will enable chatting with ChatGPT. âWe’re not messing with a good thing,â Migicovsky said. Do not fix what is not broken, is what the strategy seems to be.
Core 2 Duo is already far along in the production process. According to Migicovsky, Core Devices has already built dozens of units for testing and development, the process of launching the new company has been aided in part because he began working on development before Google even committed to open-sourcing the OS, and because he found a supplier who still had old Pebble 2 parts. Core Devices is currently in the process of making the first Core Time 2 prototypes.
The market for smartwatches has changed a lot over the years, with the largest players, Apple and Garmin, focusing on health and fitness tracking. Core Devices watches will have basic step and sleep tracking, but Migicovsky believes there remains a niche in the market for people who do not need that.
Migicovsky is not making a big gamble here, having learned from past mistakes. âWe’re not taking big risks. Weâre not trying to build millions of watches or compete with Apple or Garmin,â he said. âIf you’re looking for something that’s perfectly polished or looking for something like a Garmin, go and buy those watches.â
âThis is not designed for everyone,” he continued. “It’s designed for a very specific type of person that doesn’t feel like their needs are met by the other guys. I’m not sitting here trying to sell millions of these. This one might sell out, we are only making ten thousand a month. If it works really well and people love it, we’ll make more. But we’re taking it slowly trying to build a sustainable company.â

It wasn’t enough for US/China/South Korea-based electronics makers Wiim to give brands like Sonos and Bluesound a run for their money with some of the best network music streaming devices on the market, it had to go and launch its first non-streaming amplifier. Available today in the U.S., the 100 watt-per-channel Wiim Vibelink Amp brings big power to your digital and analog music sources for just $299.
Suited to be paired not only with Wiim products like the Wiim Ultra, but other streaming devices and even analog components like turntables, the Wiim Vibelink Amp could satisfy hi-fi enthusiasts increasingly looking for powerful, great sounding digital and analog compatible crossover devices that can be used with the wide range of era-spanning gear they might have.
Its two-channel Class-D amplification can deliver 100 watts-per-channel into a set of 8-ohm speakers or 200 watts-per-channel into 4-ohm speakers, meaning that while it’s not going to rock the roof off like other more traditional stereo receivers integrated amplifiers, you’ll have no problem filling small-to-medium sized rooms with sound. Wiim says that the Vibelink is one of the smallest 100 WPC power amplifier on the market.
All you’ll need is a set of passive speakers to connect to, and it doesn’t matter if they’re tower or bookshelf speakers, old or new — whatever fits your space and preference — and the music source of your choice, be it analog or digital.
The Wiim Vibelink can connect to digital streaming devices like its own Wiim Ultra (which it’s stackable with), Mini, or Pro devices, as well as other streamers, through its optical and coaxial digital inputs. It’s built-in ESS ES9038Q2M DAC can not only deliver high-resolution audio at up to 24-bit/192kHz, but it supports variable sample rates and bit depths for heightened compatibility with your devices.
Just to be clear for the uninitiated, though — the Vibelink has no music streaming capabilities of its own, it must be connected to a streaming music or analog source. It’s also worth noting that Wiim has similar “Amp” products, the $379 Wiim Amp Pro, which features the same ES9038Q2M DAC as the Vibelink, and the $299 Wiim Amp. Both amps feature built-in streaming capabilities, HDMI, and Bluetooth connectivity, but they wane in comparison to the Vibelink’s power at only 60 watts-per-channel (into 8 ohms).
Speaking of analog sources, the Vibelink has a single RCA line input that can be used for connecting turntables (a phono preamp is required though), CD players, or other sources, making the device an inexpensive solution for those building a system from scratch and want to be able to connect digital and analog sources.
Wiim says that the Vibelink is designed with “copper heat pipes, a large aluminum heatsink, and a heat-spreading case to reduce hot spots and evenly distribute heat,” a press release says. Its 7.9 x 7.9 x 2.58-inch chassis makes it compact (weight was not available at press time), and the front face of the sleek device features an input select button and good-sized volume dial with minimum/maximum volume indication.
“Many audio enthusiasts love the flexibility of streaming but don’t always want or need a connected amp,” said Dr. Lifeng Zhao, CEO of WiiM. “For those using devices like the WiiM Mini, Ultra, Pro, or other streaming solutions, we wanted to offer an amp that delivers exceptional sound quality and power without the need for Wi-Fi connectivity. This new design gives our customers more choice—allowing them to integrate the Vibelink Amp seamlessly into their setup and enjoy the rich, pure audio experience we’re known for.”
 The Wiim Vibelink Amp is available now on Amazon and costs $299 MSRP.
Digital and analog worlds continue to collide as Cambridge Audio announced that it has extended the retro-cool digital VU meter update that its Evo streaming amplifiers are getting today to its acclaimed CXN100 network music streamer as well.
In March, the renowned British audio gear maker fully embraced the iconic 1980s design of the DeLorean automobile with the launch of an Evo 150 Limited Edition integrated amplifier/network player. But as an added bonus, it also dropped the news that that amp, along with the Evo 75 and regular Evo 150 all-in-one players, would also receive a cool, analog-style digital VU meter and clock display feature that would be added as an over-the-air (OTA) update in May.
As promised, Wiim has officially taken the wraps off its new network music streamer, the Wiim Ultra -- a slick aluminum device with a color touchscreen, physical volume knob, and a dedicated, front-facing 3.5mm headphone output. We also now know the price: It will be $329 when it hits Amazon sometime between July 1 and September 30.
Wiim also promised that it would reveal another new device, and it turns out to be the Wiim Amp Pro, a beefed-up version of the highly rated Wiim Amp that launched earlier this year. It will sell for $369 when it arrives on Amazon around the same time as the Ultra.

Wiim's newest product, the Wiim Amp, is an amplified wireless network music player that bears a strong resemblance to the Sonos Amp, both in function and form. However, in typical Wiim fashion, it costs far less than Sonos' amplified player. At just $299, and available in silver and space grey colors, it's less than half the price of the Sonos Amp. You can buy the Wiim Amp on Amazon starting November 22.

82,2025-03-18,"Two new PebbleOS smartwatches were announced today by original Pebble watch creator Eric Migicovsky, revitalizing a Kickstarter-launched brand that had three years of mega popularity before it folded in 2016.
Called the Core 2 Duo and the Core Time 2, the two smartwatches run a PebbleOS, which is based on the source code for the software that ran on the original Pebble smartwatch. After Pebble shut down, assets were acquired by Fitbit, which was then acquired by Google. Google agreed to open source PebbleOS earlier this year, paving the way for the return of Pebble watches.
Like the original Pebble watches, the Core 2 Duo and Core Time 2 are platform agnostic and designed to work with iPhone and Android, but Migicovsky is already warning customers that Apple's restrictions are going to prevent the new devices from working like the Apple Watch.
Migicovsky says that it was difficult to design for iPhones when he was working on the original Pebble watch, and in the last eight years, ""things have actually gotten worse."" He said that his company will ""build a good app for iOS,"" but that it is impossible for a third-party smartwatch to replicate the functions of the Apple Watch. He shared an extensive list of the limitations:
Migicovsky lamented that Pebble is required to go through the App Store, which is a ""gigantic pain"" because with every update, a ""random app reviewer"" could ""make up some BS excuse"" and deny updates. He says that Apple makes it ""nearly impossible for 3rd party wearable developers"" to create an experience that mirrors the Apple Watch experience.

Apple claims their restrictions on competitors are only about security, privacy, crafting a better experience etc etc. At least that's what they tell you as they tuck you into bed. I personally don't agree - they're clearly using their market power to lock consumers into their walled ecosystem.
According to Migicovsky, the new Pebble watches will have less developed functionality on iOS than Android, which ""is Apple's fault."" He said that he does not want to see complaints about the lack of functionality, so he is sharing the info now so customers can make an informed decision about whether to buy the product. ""If you're worried about this,"" he wrote, ""the easiest solution is to buy an Android phone.""
Migicovsky calls on ""Pebble-curious"" ‌iPhone‌ users to complain loudly to Apple or switch to Android, while also asking elected representatives in the U.S. to support legislation that would require Apple to make changes to its rules. In Europe, Migicovsky plans to petition Apple to request interoperability for Apple Watch APIs.
Migicovsky last clashed with Apple over the Beeper Mini app, and he has been outspoken about Apple's ‌App Store‌ rules since then, meeting with the FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice. Beeper Mini reverse engineered iMessage protocols and encryption, using Apple's own iMessage servers to let Android users send ""blue bubble"" texts to ‌iPhone‌ users without the need for an Apple ID. Apple blocked the functionality, and Beeper was ultimately forced to give up on the idea.
The Core 2 Duo watch is priced starting at $149, and the Core Time 2 is priced starting at $225, with pre-orders available on the Repebble website. Both devices feature an always-on e-paper screen, physical buttons, step and sleep tracking, and a 30 day battery life, with the more expensive model also offering a heart rate monitor. The Core 2 Duo will ship starting in July, while the Core Time 2 will ship starting in December.

    Here's my advice for Shadows based on dozens of hours in the game ahead of launch.
  
Assassin's Creed Shadows is shaping up to be one of the most interesting and exciting installments this franchise has seen since Origins revitalized it in 2017. We previewed the game last year at Gamescom and finally went hands-on with it a couple of months ago. After numerous delays, I was happy to finally play the full build and can say it was definitely worth the wait. 
I've spent over a dozen hours in Shadows at this point, across both the PC (via Nvidia's GeForce Now streaming platform) and on Xbox. Here are a handful of tips to help you get better prepared for entering feudal Japan.
Shadows emphasizes exploration above anything else. One of the first choices you'll make when starting your game is whether you want the guide to signpost each object, holding your hand the entire way or if you want to engage in the game's more immersive directions. The game defaults to giving you only vague directions and hints about where your next quest objective is. This bolsters the game's emphasis on exploring the environment as you go. Finding new locations will grant you extra experience points and can often lead to additional side quests, random enemy encounters, hidden tombs and much more. You'll even find full cut scenes that flesh out character backstories, so explore as much as possible.
The Mastery menu shows your knowledge level in the bottom left corner.
One of the more useful extracurriculars is temples. Each of these will offer different bonuses, but knowledge points are some of the best rewards. For example, many temples will task you with finding three hidden scrolls somewhere on their grounds (or in trees/on rooftops). Knowledge points are accumulated in your mastery menu and unlock levels to progress through more of your characters' various skill trees (which you can then spend mastery points on to unlock new abilities). 
Assassin's Creed games sometimes give the player a ton of different loot (Odyssey) and sometimes offer a more limited selection (Valhalla), but Shadows has returned to overloading you with new weapons and armor. Because of this, it's not worth buying new gear from any of the vendors. While you'll always see stats for sale, you will find new loot so quickly that those stats will quickly become obsolete. Unless you find something you really like the design of, just stick to finding new gear from chests and enemies.
Pathfinder shows you an easy route to your objective, but you may be able to cut corners.
When a quest or location is tracked, you can hold Left on the D-pad to turn on pathfinder. This will bring up a white line in the game that will pulse and direct you to that waypoint. (Your horse won't auto-follow that path like it did back in Assassin's Creed Odyssey.)
While this guide is useful for directing you, the line will usually stick to roads and obvious pathways, meaning it isn't necessarily the shortest route as the crow flies. You may be able to find shortcuts and faster routes by going off path, directly toward the waypoint on your overhead compass. At the same time, not all geography can be easily passed, and going off route might lead you to a forest so dense your horse can't proceed or a cliff face too steep for you to climb. So if you're totally lost, pathfinder will be more helpful.
There are tons of shrines located in the world, and they don't appear on the map or compass with any icon. You'll usually find them along roads as you're traveling from point to point. It's worth stopping to examine them, usually allowing you to quickly pray or make an offering (which doesn't actually take anything from you). Doing so will reward the player with a variety of small incentives such as experience points, timed boosts to stats such as armor piercing or topping up resources like adrenaline (which allows you to use combat abilities). 
Do you really need a reason?
Many stray dogs and cats are walking around the various towns and villages, and you can pet all of them. Early in Shadows, you unlock a base of operations for your team where you can customize the buildings and layout, giving your characters more benefits. Part of the aesthetic customization is any animal you've pet so far. See a dog that looks different than one you've interacted with before? It can be unlocked and placed in your base. One time, when I was petting a cat, my character said, ""I'm bringing you home."" Did I just steal someone's cat?
Even though you're introduced to both protagonists, Naoe and Yasuke, in the first hour of the game, you won't actually get to play much Yasuke for quite a while. In my time with the game, I didn't unlock Yasuke for good until after using Naoe for about 10 hours. When you unlock Yasuke, the introduction sequence is extremely cool, but be prepared to wait for a second character.
However, one great thing to know is that after fully unlocking Yasuke, you can swap between the two pretty seamlessly. Unlike Grand Theft Auto 5's multi-protagonist approach, where you would warp to each character wherever they were located as they went about their day, Naoe and Yasuke will spawn at the same location. Come across a tower that Yasuke can't climb? A quick swap means Naoe will be in the same spot and ready to scale it.
Scout contracts show you what's up for grabs and what you need to do for it.
One of the main mechanics in Shadows is using scouts to survey specific areas on the map, revealing points of interest and even quest objectives for you. You can also unlock bases in many of the game's towns, where you can replenish the number of scout uses. Another feature here is scout contracts, which are various missions that will auto-generate as you play. They aren't the most interesting in quest design, ranging from assassinating a specific target to destroying a heavily guarded object. However, they do give a lot of experience and resources (used to upgrade your base). While they aren't the best quests in the game, they're definitely worth doing if you're grinding XP.
If you prioritize a stealthy approach to the game, night is your best friend. Naoe does her best work in the dark, and you'll often be able to extinguish light sources to hide further. Many enemies will be asleep while on duty at night, making it even easier to sneak up on and take out. If you have a large, dangerous fortress ahead of you, wait to tackle it until after dark. Ahead of the release, Ubisoft asserted that weather effects like rain and snow could also aid your infiltration, but in practice, the benefits are minimal compared to the huge advantage of sneaking around at night.
Naoe's Assassin skill tree features a handy double assassination skill.
Naoe is much stronger when she hasn't alerted the enemy. Taking out opponents from the shadows and assassinating without being detected is key to using her. This makes her Assassination skill tree very useful and where you should prioritize spending your skill points. Any skills that increase the amount of assassination damage will allow you to take out stronger opponents without having to fight. The double assassination skill is also extremely useful since enemies will often bunch together and you can eliminate them even more easily.
Assassin's Creed Shadows launches on Xbox, PS5, and PC on March 20."

86,2025-03-18,"The crypto industry is expected to join the financial mainstream in the U.S. as the regulatory environment improves, and Coinbase (COIN) is well positioned to benefit from these tailwinds, broker Bernstein said in a report Monday.
Bernstein initiated coverage of the crypto exchange with an outperform rating and a $310 price target. About 41% of Wall Street analysts have a buy rating on the stock, 7% sell and the rest hold, according to FactSet data. The shares dropped 2% to $185.20 in early trading.
Regulatory clarity will result in more competition for Coinbase from fintech companies, brokers and banks, the report said.
Still, a ""strong bull market and rising U.S. onshore dominance"" is expected to more than offset market share and pricing pressures, analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote. 
An improving regulatory backdrop under Donald Trump's new administration is viewed as a huge tailwind for digital assets, and the President has promised to make the U.S. the ""crypto capital of the world.""
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formed a new crypto task force led by Commissioner Hester Peirce to draft new regulations for the industry.
Coinbase has done well to diversify beyond trading, the report said, and the exchange now has a strong presence in U.S. dollar stablecoins and crypto yield services, such as staking.
Bernstein said it expects Coinbase to grow non-trading revenues by around a 31% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2024-2026.
This provides a ""strong balance to cyclicality of trading revenues,"" the report added.
Coinbase recently secured FIU registration, paving the way for a return to the Indian market, the company said in a blog post earlier this month.

Kit cars are typically an inherently uncool subgenre of the enthusiast world. By driving a kit car you're living a lie, pushing a narrative that you can afford more car than you really can. Supercars are already decidedly uncool, but spending the time and effort to emulate the supercar looks without any of the supercar performance is just pure dork behavior. That is, unless you lean into it and build something that nobody would ever mistake for the real deal. Pushing your kit car build from mere facsimile to wild manga drawing brought to life is a step toward making your fake Lamborghini kind of cool again. This fiberglass job is slapped over the top of a stretched Pontiac Fiero chassis, because of course it is, and it's on its way toward being a really cool machine, but I think I know how to make the switch flip all the way to cool as heck. It needs an engine swap. 
All V6 Pontiac Fieros used the unkillable but hardly high-performance L44 2.8-liter making 140 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque. This engine is holding this Lam-faux-ghini back from its true potential. Some Fiero enthusiasts will swap in the relatively easy-to-install Cadillac 4.9-liter L26 V8 with a slightly more impressive 200 horsepower and 275 lb-ft, but this is even still not enough. An early 5.7-liter Lamborghini Diablo, by comparison, pushed 485 horses and 428 lb-ft of torque from its V12 engine, so in order to make this kit car really something special, it should be able to exceed that number. Thankfully General Motors made a 303 horsepower transverse FWD V8 that can be installed in the Fiero engine bay, and fitted with a supercharger for at least 550 ponies. Yeah, that should do it. 
Heck, maybe I should buy it and do that very thing. 

From the seller: 
""I have a lamborgini diablo kit car foresale.....car runs drives stops and everything functions as it should both doors go up and down custome interior new exhaust car was built on a fiero frame that was stretched v6 motor 5peed trans""
This car is an aesthetic victory looking like it was ripped from the pages of a comic book, it needs enough power to back up its good looks. The show should never outshine the go, it has to have enough cash in the bank to cover the checks its bodywork has been writing. The Fiero is pretty uncool, but fitting it with a Diablo body made it deeply uncool. Kicking it up a notch with a ""manga livery"" makes it slightly cooler than a stock Fiero, but it won't be truly cool until it can embarrass a stock Diablo at every race track in the world. Spend a lot of time and effort perfecting the handling, balance, grip, and power of this mean green machine, and you could have one of the coolest cars ever made. A factory Diablo ran a quarter mile in about 12 seconds, so you'll want to make sure this one can do it in 11 seconds. Don't worry if it makes sense, just do it. 
Beating a Diablo at its own game with good old-fashioned American hot rodding is the way forward, my friend. None of us can afford to go pick up the Diablo we dreamed about in the 1990s for a cool quarter mil or more, but maybe we can build our own. This seller, in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, is asking a measly $15,000 for this car. At this point it's just another cool-looking kit car with nothing to back it up, but with another fifty to one-hundred thousand dollars invested, you could have a home-built hypercar for a fraction of the money. Oh dang, we can't afford that either, can we?"

Measles is back. After the disease was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, it was easy to feel like it was gone for good. But “eliminated” means there was no ongoing local spread. It’s not the same as “eradicated.” With a few dozen cases popping up here and there each year, as soon as vaccination rates dip, the illness rears can rear its ugly head once more—just as it is right now.
People have mostly forgotten how bad measles can be. In a world where vaccination rates are typically above 95 percent, it’s incredibly rare to see even a single hospitalization for the condition. But, now, as outbreaks spread, parents across the country are desperately looking for a way to protect their children from an infection with a fatality rate of around 1 in 1,000. That might sound low, but compare it to COVID-19 in 2020 in children age 5: It’s around 100 times more deadly. And for kids who survive measles, there can be other nasty complications. For example, there is evidence that for some kids measles permanently damages the immune system, leaving them more vulnerable to other diseases.
The obvious way to protect your family is simple: vaccination. The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is one of the safest medical interventions we have and provides extremely good protection against the disease. But Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the new head of the Department of Health and Human Services, has suggested that vitamin A supplements are just as useful as vaccines. “Studies have found that vitamin A can dramatically reduce measles mortality,” he wrote in an op-ed for Fox News. “Good nutrition remains a best defense against most chronic and infectious illnesses.”
Unfortunately, the idea that good nutrition is a “best defense” simply isn’t true. You can eat a remarkably healthy diet and still become very ill. Vitamin A supplements do have some benefits—but they won’t protect your children from measles.
First, there is a grain of truth to the idea that vitamin A can be a useful tool when it comes to measles. The vitamin is a molecule that your body uses for a wide range of purposes. One of the main things that it does is help you mount an effective immune defense. We have known for decades that people with very low vitamin A levels are at much higher risk of suffering and dying from many infectious diseases.
To put it simply (in fact, perhaps too simply!): Vitamin A deficiency causes you to be particularly vulnerable to infectious disease, including measles. Correcting that deficiency solves this problem.
There are a number of studies from the ’80s and ’90s to back up this idea. A famous study found that a vitamin A supplement for children who were admitted to the hospital with measles reduced the risk of those kids dying by nearly 80 percent. A 2017 review that aggregated a range of trials together did not show a benefit for mortality, but did find that the vitamin reduced the risk of children having a diagnosed case of the disease.
These studies are why vitamin A supplementation is still recommended as a treatment for children who are hospitalized with measles. But the problem is that they don’t really have all that much relevance to children in the United States today. The famous study I mentioned above was conducted in 1987 in Cape Town in a mostly Black population at a time when the apartheid regime still held sway. The studies aggregated together in the 2017 review were mostly conducted in China, India, and Africa in the ’80s.
In most of these settings, vitamin A deficiency was not just common—it was ubiquitous. Some of these countries had deficiency rates above 20 percent. Meanwhile, the most recent and robust data we’ve got, from the ’90s, suggests that fewer than 1 in 100 children in the U.S. have a vitamin A deficiency. Some even more recent data puts the rates even lower, although that study was mostly looking at pregnant women. This is perhaps not surprising in a world where you can get enough vitamin A dining exclusively on the McDonald’s menu.
We also know that vitamin A supplements are unlikely to help kids who have enough vitamin A. For example, a massive 1990 study conducted in India showed that vitamin A supplements reduced the risk of kids dying from measles and other infectious diseases by more than half. However, all of this benefit was in children who showed very obvious signs of malnourishment, like stunted growth or skin clinging to their bones. Those kids had an 89 percent reduction in their risk of death.  Children who were not malnourished had no reduction in risk at all.
Also, things are actually little more complicated than “If you have a vitamin A deficiency, a supplement can protect against measles.” One of the largest trials ever conducted—in over 1 million children—took place in northern India in the ’00s and calls that straightforward idea into question. In this region, vitamin A deficiency was very common. The study randomly allocated kids to either get a very high-dose vitamin A supplement or a placebo medication once every six months. At the end of the trial, death rates from measles and a variety of other diseases were the same, although the rate of vitamin A deficiency had dropped drastically in the supplement group. There was also no difference in the rate of diagnosed measles between vitamin A and a placebo in this massive trial.
This seems to conflict with the evidence from the ’80s and ’90s that was summarized in the 2017 review I discussed above, but if you look closer, it makes sense. While vitamin A deficiency was still quite common in India in the ’00s—the study found rates of 10–15 percent without supplementation—the situation was still much better than it was two decades earlier. (For example, a study in 1993 showed that rates of eye disease caused by vitamin A deficiency were 22 percent in Uttar Pradesh, where this large randomized trial was later conducted.) The point is that the more modern evidence does not seem to show as much benefit for vitamin A supplementation for measles (though there are benefits for other things). This could be because the rate of severe malnutrition has dropped globally since the first of these studies were conducted.
It’s also worth noting that none of these studies have tested the sort of supplement that you can buy in a supermarket or pharmacy. Most store-bought vitamin A supplements have somewhere between 300 and 1,500 micrograms of the substance in them. The average amount used in these studies—which, remember, are of kids with severe deficiency—is about 30,000 micrograms. That’s between 20 and 100 times higher than your average multivitamin.
If you live in an area with severe malnutrition, where kids are literally starving on the streets, then a vitamin A supplement is probably a good way to reduce your child’s risk of extremely nasty disease. But if you live in the U.S., where fewer than 1 in 100 kids have low vitamin A levels and even fewer have a true deficiency, the supplements probably aren’t going to do very much.
Yes, your immune system can function better when you are not malnourished, but the best way to protect against measles is vaccination. Really, it’s not even an either/or proposition—feed your kids and also get them vaccinated. We got rid of the disease for 25 years. There’s no need to bring it back.

92,2025-03-18,"Solana doesn't yet have an exchange-traded fund, but one of the asset's biggest backers is betting the Wall Street-friendly vehicle could come in 2025 — and believes it's well-positioned to trounce Ethereum's various similar products.
Multicoin Capital's Kyle Samani — a major investor in SOL and countless subordinate protocols — has been publicly pressing the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to look favorably upon a SOL ETF. His bullish pronouncements therefore might come as little surprise.
But onstage Tuesday at Blockworks' Digital Asset Summit in New York City, Samani explained his view why Solana is better placed to appeal to traditional investors than Ethereum did. It's all about the money: the fees being generated on-chain, compared to the value of the asset's totality.
""A lot of the reason why the ETH ETF didn't have a super strong reception was a lot of investors looked at ETH and said 'show me the fees,' Samani said. 
By his telling, they didn't find much proof to justify investing at its high prices.
Stock traders often look at a company's price to earnings ratio in deciding whether it's over or undervalued; in other words, when to invest. Crypto doesn't have such a clean metric, but blockchains still have revenue and tokens that can be mushed together for similar effect.
Samani believes Solana's theoretical P/E ratio is much healthier from an investing standpoint than Ethereum's. His onstage math placed Solana as trading at 30 to 50 times its P/E whereas Ethereum is trading closer to 1,000 times.
Solana's P/E ratio is ""much more in line with high-growth tech stocks,"" Samani said.

BYD, the world’s biggest electric vehicle maker, plans to raise its market share in Europe by building factories there to avoid stiff tariffs while news of its latest technology breakthroughs might persuade doubting customers to embrace Chinese EVs.
BYD’s factory in Hungary will start production later this year with a capacity of 150,000 a year, rising to 300,000. A second one in Turkey with similar volume starts up next year, while the company has said a 3rd factory is on the cards but won’t say where. Somewhere in Germany is the current favorite to avoid the European Union’s extra 17% levy on China’s EVs on top of the regular 10% tariff.
Investment bank UBS said this decision is being debated within BYD because of Germany’s high labor and energy costs.
BYD has announced plans to open a fast-charging system in China, which it says can rival the refueling speed of pumps at gas stations. There was no word when this might be available in Europe. BYD was said to be a laggard in advanced driving assistance systems and autonomous software but recently announced this is now available on some of its cheapest models.
BYD is currently an also-ran in European sales, where SAIC and its MG and Maxus brands led the way with just under 70,000 last year. Geely with Polestar, Smart and Zeekr came second with close to 57,900, the BYD’s 41,000, according to Schmidt Automotive Research. Schmidt expects a big spurt this year with sales more than doubling to over 100,000.

That compares with market leader Volkswagen’s 413,500 via its own brand, Audi, Skoda, Cupra/SEAT and Porsche, and a share of 21.4%. Tesla was second with 311,600 (16.1%), according to Schmidt.
BYD recently raised $5.6 billion selling shares on the Hong Kong stock market to fund its ambitious export program.

The Financial Times Lex column quoted JPMorgan saying BYD sales in China will rise 30% compared with last year to 5.5 million.
“But its real test lies beyond China, as BYD has set an aggressive export target of 800,000, nearly double last year’s overseas sales – a goal that will require greater global buy-in to achieve,” Lex said.
Investment researcher Bernstein expects success for BYD’s foreign push.
“Overall, we find BYD’s rational for share placement reasonable. We have long been bullish on the company’s overseas potential, as supported by strong volume growth for its EVs and plug-in hybrids across Europe. Latin America and Asia, among other regions,” Bernstein said in a report.
BYD’s new fast-charging technology fills another gap in its portfolio with its ability to add 250 miles of range in 5 minutes, about the same as for an ICE vehicle.
“BYD unveiled its megawatt flash charging technology, that enables EV charging at the same speed as at a gas pump. The technology is based on the new “Super-E Platform” and with the 1,000V and 1,000A architecture, it is capable of a power output of 1,000kW,” Bernstein said.
“We are generally impressed by the fast charging capability, which is an area BYD previously lagged some of its peers. We consider BYD's rapid, large-scale deployment of flash chargers to be a crucial area of focus, as that is a key enabler of the new charging technology,” according to Bernstein.

BYD didn’t say when or if it would be exporting these chargers to Europe.
This expected success in Europe would be bad news for local manufacturers, not least because of Chinese manufacturers’ alleged 30% advantage in efficiency. But it will be made worse by the expected stagnation in sales in 2025.
“We note that with a flattish European market, any market share gain by BYD and (other Chinese brands) implies market share losses for European manufacturers,” UBS said.

In the American drug industry, a trend has developed among manufacturers and pharmacy benefits managers (PBM) that threatens to upend a productive balance between rewarding manufacturer innovation and lowering patient costs.
Recently, some PBMs have used their leverage to block biosimilars or favor more expensive ones produced by their parent companies. The trend is costing patients and businesses, stifling innovation and taxing our economy. From 2021 to 2025, biosimilar savings were $38.4 billion under expectation according to the American Journal of Managed Care. One need not look further than the well-publicized games that drug middlemen play to understand why.
In The Great American Drug Deal: A New Prescription for Innovative and Affordable Medicines, Peter Kolchinsky, biotechnology thought leader, advocates for a system where drugs enjoy a period of patent protection to incentivize research and development. Once this period ends, Kolchinsky believes generics should be introduced to lower prices and make the medication more accessible. To him, the transition from brand-name to generic drugs is a mechanism to balance affordable access for patients with a competitive, innovation-driven pharmaceutical industry.
In recent years, biosimilars entered the market to provide FDA-approved, safe and effective versions of specialty drugs. Biosimilars are different from generics in their composition, approval process and standards, but they are similar to generics in two ways: They can be approved and manufactured by other drug companies once a specialty medication's patent expires, and they offer the promise of lower costs.
In Europe, their introduction led to price reductions of up to 80% for some medications. The U.S. healthcare system anticipated similar results, projecting billions in savings for patients and insurers.
Unfortunately, biosimilars have failed to deliver on expectations in the American market. Why? The answer has to do with PBMs and their role in the drug ecosystem. PBMs were created in the late 1950s to help health plans manage prescription drug costs. PBMs develop lists called formularies that dictate what drugs health plans cover. This initially helped keep costs down by streamlining coverage. But today, PBMs have grown into influential entities with substantial control over drug access and affordability.
Because PBMs control formularies and determine what drugs are covered by insurance, they can influence patient transitions from branded drugs to more affordable biosimilars or generics by adding those alternatives to their formularies. Instead, they often use their leverage to keep patients on pricier medications. Why? PBMs typically derive some of their revenue from manufacturer rebates offered on brand name drugs. The higher the list price on the drug, the larger the rebate so it’s more profitable for them to keep patients on pricier drugs.
Humira's story illustrates this. Before competitors could manufacture biosimilars in 2023, Humira generated $20 billion in annual sales for manufacturer AbbVie. As Humira’s biosimilars entered the market in 2023, they saw little to no uptake by big PBMs. To incentivize formulary placement, some manufacturers offered biosimilars at two price points. For example, manufacturer Amgen launched its Humira biosimilar, Amjevita, at two price points: the first at $1,557 per 40mg dose, a 55% discount from Humira's list price of $3,461, and the second at $3,288 per 40mg dose, a 5% discount.
Why would they offer the same drug at two price points? Because the costlier option likely came with a larger rebate, which meant more revenue for the PBM. Note that the larger rebate didn’t lower the net price of the higher priced Amjevita to make it the lowest cost option.
In another move, CVS created a drug manufacturer, Cordavis, and contracted with others to co-produce and sell drugs to its PBM-owned specialty pharmacy. (Disclosure: CVS is in my company's pharmacy network, and our members can fill prescriptions at CVS Pharmacy locations.) One of those products is Humira biosimilar Hyrimoz. CVS now claims to have removed Humira from its national formularies and converted 97% of its patients to Hyrimoz. While Hyrimoz is more affordable than Humira, it's not the least expensive option on the market. Antitrust activists are concerned that this type of behavior could discourage investment in biosimilar research and development.
If left unchecked, the power of PBMs and their complex relationships within the American healthcare system could lead to higher drug costs and diminished returns for drug innovation. By parking patients on biosimilars while limiting competition, some PBMs are protecting their revenue streams at the expense of market access and affordability. Without a commitment to transparency, we risk stifling biosimilar innovation and depriving patients of future breakthroughs and cost-saving alternatives.
As CEOs and heads of benefits, you don’t have to sit back and accept this. It’s time to pay closer attention. You have the power to challenge the status quo and demand better. If your current partners aren’t delivering transparency and cost-efficiency, then it may be time to find new ones who will.
This isn’t just about balancing budgets—it’s about ensuring that the healthcare system advances because the best therapies succeed on their own merit. The choices you make today directly influence the healthcare landscape of tomorrow.
By demanding transparency and supporting competition, organizations can help remove the barriers that stifle biosimilar innovation. This could lead to a more dynamic marketplace where new, cost-effective therapies can flourish—one that drives a future where breakthrough treatments are accessible and affordable for all.

Ethereum Faces Bearish Pressure Amid Market Uncertainty.  (Photo Illustration by Budrul Chukrut/SOPA ... [+] Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)
Less than two months into Trump's presidency, Bitcoin has entered a bear market, impacted by a broader downturn in global stocks. After recently reaching a six-figure all-time high, the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap has now dropped to approximately $80,000, marking a decline of nearly 25% from its January peak. This abrupt but recurring trend highlights a key reality: the Web3 space remains heavily influenced by speculation and market hype.
However, I have some optimism to share after our team wrapped up a fruitful and constructive engagement at ETHDenver, one of the largest annual Ethereum and Web3 gatherings, blending hackathons, conferences, and community-driven innovations.
Like everywhere else, AI (and decentralized AI) was a significant topic of discussion at ETHDenver. The difference, however, is that attending ETHDenver reaffirmed my faith in what we are building. At the very least, it proves that we are clear about what we are doing.
Having traveled the world for crypto events over the years has left me with mixed feelings. I am sometimes confused and puzzled by how blatantly some projects and investors run solely on narrative rather than actual innovation or tangible products. It is jaw-dropping to see how often grandiose ideas take precedence over pragmatic execution.
Taking a broader temporal view of the crypto industry's evolution, of the over 24,000 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinGecko since 2014 to the end of 2023, over 50% have died. 2021 was the worst year: over 70% listed that year have become defunct. A 2022 study found that less than 50% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization had a working product, highlighting how many projects operate purely on narratives rather than delivering real value. Looking further back, a 2018 analysis mirrors the same reality; it revealed that only 36 out of the top 100 cryptocurrencies had active, publicly available products.
While more recent data is scarce, the absence of updated studies itself reflects the chaotic nature of this space—where conducting thorough research and due diligence remains challenging. Even with older studies, the trend remains unchanged, aligning with my observations of an industry often driven more by hype than actual progress.
More recently, we've also seen politicians fuel pump-and-dump schemes, which affect millions of retail investors and further underscore the risks in an industry often driven more by speculation than substance.
For years, I have advocated for a more grounded approach to innovation, especially in AI. The key to sustainable progress is not in chasing flashy concepts or crafting the perfect pitch deck to lure investors—it is in thoughtful execution, in finding real-world applications that transform ideas into viable businesses.
Thankfully, ETHDenver was different. This time, my team and I encountered many bright minds who genuinely focused on building rather than chasing the latest hype cycles. We saw compelling, well-executed ideas demonstrating clear use cases and practical implementations. To further foster a culture of meaningful innovation, we hosted a Hackerhouse competition, which drew an overwhelming level of interest and participation from passionate coders across the U.S. The projects from this competition give me immense optimism for the future—proof that some builders are quietly pushing forward with conviction and purpose.
First place went to the team LabsDAO, which developed LabsMarket, a decentralized AI marketplace that connects real-world contributions with the Human AI economy. Their platform enables secure data upload, intellectual property registration, and MLOps integration.
Second place was awarded to Thousand Monkeys Thousand Typewriters for their project Frost. Frost is a decentralized exchange and token launchpad built for the DeAI layer-1 blockchain, aiming to lay the foundation for AI-integrated DeFi infrastructure.
Third place went to OORTCAPTCHA, a team that developed a fully on-chain, decentralized data labeling and reinforcement learning protocol. Their solution ensures sybil-resistant AI data validation, making it a crucial tool for AI-powered data labeling.
These teams aren't just theorizing about the future but actively building it. Their dedication to decentralized AI, practical applications of blockchain, and robust infrastructure development reminds us that while the market fluctuates, substance prevails.
At the same time, while ETHDenver was a refreshing showcase of real builders, the broader crypto space—particularly the Ethereum community—is facing another crisis of confidence. Ethereum and Vitalik Buterin have been at the center of controversy, with growing skepticism around Ethereum's token dynamics and long-term vision. The ongoing discussions around Ethereum's staking centralization, scalability trade-offs, and governance challenges have intensified, fueling bearish sentiment and doubts about its future.
This serves as yet another reminder that crypto's cycles are brutally reflective in exposing projects that thrive on hype rather than sustainable innovation. Many projects that were celebrated during bull markets are now facing existential crises, unable to justify their inflated valuations. But history has shown that real builders persist through these downturns, refining their products and proving their worth over time.
While the broader market may be negative, ETHDenver reinforced my belief that slow, steady, and thoughtful development is the only path to long-term success. The real breakthroughs in AI, blockchain, and Web3 will not come from those chasing short-term hype but those willing to commit to solving real problems, one block at a time.
So yes, the market may be down, but my optimism remains high. The future of AI and its decentralized approach is being built by those who prioritize substance over spectacle. That is where real value lies, so I am still bullish on the road ahead."

From Strategy To Success: How Process Drives B2B Growth
B2B organizations often find themselves at a crossroads between strategy formulation and strategy execution. The harsh reality is that many fail to transform their well-crafted strategies into tangible results, a disconnect stemming from a fundamental oversight: the underestimation of process as a critical lever for execution. Process is not merely a conduit for efficiency; it’s the backbone of converting strategy into results. Without a robust process in place to develop and execute strategy, reaching your goals becomes a herculean task. This necessity becomes even more pronounced when executing a customer-obsessed growth strategy in which the focus intensifies on delivering value at every customer touchpoint.
Why do so many organizations falter in executing their strategies? The answer often lies in the gap between those who devise strategies and those tasked with implementing them. Many B2B companies possess a growth strategy, or at the very least, target revenue goals. Yet instead of focusing on aligning their strategy with how they operate, they quickly turn to buying new technology or reorganizing resources, thinking that it will solve their problems.
Process matters immensely. It has a direct impact on the customers’ experiences, whether the process is internally focused or is a customer-facing activity. Processes accelerate an organization’s time to market, allow organizations to adapt to market changes, lead to predictable outcomes, enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and increase profitability. In essence, process is the engine that drives growth, not just by optimizing performance but by enabling companies to be agile and responsive in a dynamic market environment.
Follow these steps to adopt process optimization as the required tool used to execute your strategy:
Finally, don’t forget to celebrate wins, both big and small, along the way! Providing an avenue for team members to acknowledge their successes fosters a culture of recognition and motivates teams to strive for continuous improvement. It’s a vital component of maintaining momentum and reinforcing the value of the processes that have been put in place.
The significance of process in strategy execution cannot be overstated. It’s the linchpin that connects strategic planning with tangible outcomes. By investing in and meticulously designing interconnected processes, organizations can not only anticipate but also adapt to market changes, ultimately driving sustainable growth. The journey from strategy to execution may be complex, but with a robust process as your guide, achieving your B2B goals is not just possible — it’s probable.
