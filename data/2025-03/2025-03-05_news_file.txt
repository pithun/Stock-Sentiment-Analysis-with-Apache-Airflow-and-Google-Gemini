The sporty hatchback will sell for €20,000 when it launches in Europe in 2027. But when will we see it in the US?
by  Andrew J. Hawkins
Volkswagen is bringing up the lights on the ID. EVERY1 show car that it says will become the promised €20,000 (about $20,800 USD) affordable EV that will hopefully turn around the automaker’s struggling business. 
As market leaders like Tesla continue to promise — but not deliver — the elusive entry-level EV, VW is hoping to shake things up with the unveiling of plans for a whole lineup of mass-market vehicles. The car will also be a crucial competitor as VW hopes to fend off a tidal wave of affordable Chinese EVs. But whether it makes it to North America, with all the uncertainty around EV policy right now, remains unknown. 
The car will be a crucial competitor as VW hopes to fend off a tidal wave of affordable Chinese EVs
The ID. EVERY1 will slot below the ID. 2all, which was first unveiled in 2023 with the promised price of €25,000. Both vehicles are only slated for Europe for now, with production expected to begin in 2026 for the ID. 2all and 2027 for the ID. EVERY1. (It seems likely those names could change, too, when we actually get closer to production.)
The ID. EVERY1 is a small hatchback with new software and some neat tricks like a modular center console — characteristics it will share with the ID. 2all. Both models are part of the new “Electric Urban Car Family” based on front-wheel drive versions of VW’s modular electric platform. These new EVs are being developed under the umbrella of the Core brand group within the Volkswagen Group, the company said. In total, the automaker expects to unveil nine new models by 2027.
The production versions of the ID. EVERY1 and ID. 2all will be built on the second-generation version of VW’s modular “MEB” platform. The current version of MEB powers the ID.4 crossover SUV, the ID Buzz minivan, and a dozen other vehicles from Audi, Skoda, and others. 
Of course, for that price, you can’t expect much in the realm of performance or range. VW says the concept ID. EVERY1 tops out at 81mph and is powered by a newly developed electric motor with 94 horsepower (70kW). VW didn’t disclose the battery size, but based on the estimated 155 miles (250km) of range, we can assume it’s somewhere around 35kWh. 
The ID. EVERY1 won’t take up much room, at 152.8 inches in length, or around 27 inches shorter than the VW ID.4. Still, the hatchback can fit up to four passengers, with 10.8 cubic feet of storage in the trunk. 
VW says the production version of the ID. EVERY1 will be the company’s first vehicle to feature a new “powerful” software architecture that promises over-the-air updates. (Software has proven to be a bit of a pain for VW, with bugs and infrequent updates plaguing its ID family of vehicles for years.) 
Design-wise, the ID. EVERY1 looks chunky and fairly adorable, with cues from small SUVs as well as VW’s discontinued Up and Polo minicars, while also retaining stylings from the ID. Life concept from 2021. VW says the new design language that infuses the ID. EVERY1 and ID. 2all emphasizes minimalism, likability, and a “secret sauce” like the “flying roof concept,” in which the roof surface is lower in the middle without restricting headroom on the inside. 
VW is also bringing some of the modular designs from the ID Buzz to the low-cost segment. The center console can be transferred to the rear of the vehicle, and the dash features a rail on which various accessories can be affixed, including a tablet, shelf, or table. There’s also a small illuminated and removable Bluetooth speaker between the driver and front passenger, reminiscent of Rivian’s R1 vehicles.
EV prices aren’t the only place Volkswagen is trying to cut costs. Following a labor strike in Germany, it reached a union deal that will mean 35,000 fewer workers and billions per year in cost cutting.
Other automakers are increasingly piling into the affordable EV space. As competition from China heats up, Hyundai and Kia are both promising more low-cost models. Tesla swears it will have a lower-priced EV to reveal sometime this year. And even Ford says it plans on releasing its own entry-level EVs — just as soon as it figures out how to make them profitable.

Florida's housing market is cooling as a record-setting number of homes were listed for sale in February.

According to Realtor.com, 168,717 properties went on the market in February, the highest number the site has recorded since it started keeping track in 2016.
    

        The total number of properties for sale in Florida jumped by 40% since February 2024, Realtor.com found. In some cities, there are more than double the number of listings compared to last year. Only seven cities out of the 252 Realtor.com tracked had fewer listings this year than last.
    

        Economists and other housing-market experts use increases in inventory to identify areas where demand and competition for houses might be waning. There, homebuyers might start to have an edge over home sellers. Increased inventory is also an indicator that home prices could fall.
    

        Even though Palm Beach real estate is experiencing what some brokers call a ""Trump bump,"" with expensive properties changing hands, other parts of the state are getting cheaper.
    

        ""Home shoppers in Bradenton and Sarasota are in for a treat with climbing inventory, falling prices, and longer time on market,"" Realtor.com senior economic research analyst Hannah Jones said in the report. ""Buyers are likely to find more seller flexibility as homeowners aim to attract buyer attention.""
    

        Because the pandemic housing boom led to record-low levels of inventory nationwide, more homes for sale can sometimes signal a return to normal rather than a housing-market decline. In some parts of Florida, however, the influx of homes on the market and other forces are already having an effect on property values.
    

        Take Greenacres, Florida, an enclave 10 miles southwest of West Palm Beach. In January 2025, the median listing price was $259,950, 13% less than in January 2024.
    

        Other factors are weighing on the Florida housing market, including relatively higher mortgage rates that stifle homebuyer demand, intensifying property damage from natural disasters, and rising homeowners' association, or HOA, fees.
    

        Here are 17 Florida cities with the biggest increases in homes for sale year-over-year, according to data from Realtor.com. Homebuyers and investors may want to eye these spots for better deals and more negotiating power.
    

The Realtor.com data about homes on the market is from February 2025, while the median listing prices are from January, the most recent month available.

One way to keep tariffs from sinking your stock portfolio? Invest in companies with products so good that they can raise their prices at will.

        That's the thinking behind a list of stocks Morgan Stanley published in a client note on Monday.
    

        The bank's top equity strategist, Mike Wilson, had his team of analysts put together a list of companies that they think are most protected from tariffs compared to other firms in their respective industries, perhaps because they can pass along the higher import costs to consumers.
    

        The note came amid news that President Donald Trump's trade war with Canada, Mexico, and China is back in full force — for now, at least.
    

        Stocks fell on Tuesday on the news as investors worried about the ramifications for inflation, interest rates, and corporate earnings.
    

        While Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has hinted that the 25% tariffs imposed on America's two neighbors and the 20% import fees on Chinese goods could be reduced soon, it remains unclear to what degree they could come down and for how long. New tariffs on goods from European Union countries are also expected at some point.
    

        Below are the 18 stocks on the list that Morgan Stanley also has an ""Overweight"" rating on, meaning the bank thinks investors might do well to hold the stock in their portfolios above its weight in the S&P 500. Their industry group and the Morgan Stanley analyst that covers the stock are also included.

A million dollars will only buy you about as much space as a parking spot in Monaco.

        That's according to this year's Knight Frank Wealth Report, which found that $1 million will buy just 19 square meters, or about 205 square feet, of prime residential property in the microstate on the French Riviera. 
    

        In comparison, the same amount would get you 34 square meters (about 366 square feet) in New York — the world's sixth most-expensive market for luxury real estate.
    

        Hong Kong is ranked second, followed by Singapore, Geneva, and London.
    

        Monaco remains a magnet for the superrich due to its lack of income or capital gains taxes, along with its favorable climate and high-quality healthcare.
    

        However, housing costs are exceptionally high. Monaco was also the world's most expensive luxury rental market last year.
    

        A Knight Frank analysis from May 2024 found that renting a 1,100-square-foot property in Monaco starts at about $19,350 a month. A $30,000 budget would likely only stretch to a modest two-bedroom apartment.
    

        Monaco's extreme property prices are driven by a lack of space to build more properties, resulting in a limited housing supply.
    

        At just 510 acres, Monaco is the world's second-smallest sovereign state after the Vatican City.
    

        For perspective, the constitutional monarchy is smaller than New York's Central Park, which covers 843 acres, while the entire city spans about 200,000 acres.
    

        According to the latest World Bank data, Monaco is also the most densely populated country, with 18,681 people per square kilometer.
    

        To address the space constraints, Monaco has been reclaiming land from the sea for decades. In 2019, Savills said it was investing more than $2 billion to extend Monaco's coastline by a further 15 acres, creating homes for about 1,000 people.

DeepSeek's latest model barely made a dent in Anthropic's business, said the company's chief product officer.

        Mike Krieger said on an episode of the Twenty Minute VC podcast published Monday that the Chinese AI startup had ""almost no impact"" on Anthropic's market position or go-to-market strategy.
    

        For Anthropic — best known for its Claude AI models — success isn't just about model performance. The company prioritizes long-term work with businesses over treating APIs as a transactional product, Krieger said.
    

        ""I want to dream big with you. I want to think about not just your API, but also Claude for work,"" said Krieger, who cofounded Instagram. ""What you're providing people is AI partnership, not just AI models.""
    

        Founded in 2023 by Chinese entrepreneur Liang Wenfeng, DeepSeek shook up the AI industry and the US stock market with its low-cost reasoning model, R1, unveiled in January. The company said its R1 model rivals top competitors, like ChatGPT's o1, but at a fraction of the cost.
    

        The launch raised questions about Silicon Valley's strategy of investing billions in data centers and cutting-edge chips for AI training.
    

        Krieger's comments came ahead of Anthropic's Tuesday announcement that it had raised $3.5 billion in fresh funding at a $61.5 billion valuation.
    

        Lightspeed Venture Partners led the round. Other backers included Salesforce Ventures, Cisco Investments, General Catalyst, Fidelity Management & Research Company, Menlo Ventures, and D1 Capital Partners.
    

        With the new investment, Anthropic plans to ramp up the development of its next-generation AI systems, expand its compute capacity, and deepen research into AI interpretability and alignment. The company is also looking to accelerate global expansion, it said.
    

        The funding round follows the late Februarylaunch of Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Claude Code.
    

        Krieger said companies are no longer just looking for simple API transactions, in which they exchange tokens for AI-generated output.
    

        To use AI models through APIs provided by cloud companies, businesses usually pay based on the number of tokens, the units that measure the amount of data processed by AI models.
    

        Instead, Krieger said companies want to build long-term partnerships with AI providers who can co-design products and integrate AI into their existing workflows.
    

        The product chief isn't the only one at Anthropic who has downplayed DeepSeek's impact on the company.
    

        Earlier in January, Anthropic'sCEO, Dario Amodei, wrote in a blog post that he doesn't view the Chinese AI startup as ""adversaries.""
    

        He stressed that export controls on AI technology to China are becoming more crucial, especially considering the country's track record on human rights and its aggressive stance internationally.
    

        Meanwhile, OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman,has taken a different approach, calling DeepSeek an ""invigorating"" competitor driving his company to accelerate the release of ""better models.""
    

Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta, said in Januaryit was too early to gauge DeepSeek's impact on the company's AI spending. He said that while DeepSeek has done ""novel things,"" it likely won't change how Meta is investing in AI.

8,2025-03-05,"How much do you need to spend to get the most out of your games at 4K? There’s no such thing as a true budget option, but the Radeon RX 9070 XT isâat the momentâyour best, most cost-effective recourse. At $600, this graphics card is so solid for achieving playable framerates at max settings and 4K, it’s almost enough to make you forget about DLSS 4âs and Nvidiaâs oft-touted multi-frame genâ¦ almost.
AMDâs aggressive pricing gives two competing products a punch in the gut. One of those is the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti at $750 MSRP, or the expected base price. The other is AMDâs own $550 Radeon RX 9070 (our review is coming soon). If the RX 9070 is supposed to be equivalent in performance to Nvidiaâs $550 RTX 5070, then the extra $50 for the XT is a no-brainer for any PC gamer who wants juggle more hardcore, 4K gaming scenarios on desktop. The RTX 5070 Ti may have the edge in some games, but that hardly matters when stock issues have put that card above $800 orâin some casesâeven close to $1,000.
The RX 9070 XTâs strengths all depend on whether AMD can meet demand. If stocks hold, the scalpers don’t get overwhelm supply, and you can find one at MSRP, itâs easily one of the best bang-for-buck options available this year. It may not be as flashy as a new Nvidia RTX 5080 Founders Edition, but you shouldn’t need to pay over $1,000 to play your games at 4K. If AMD is right about one thing, it’s that the focus of the market should be on mid-range GPUs, not those at the top end.
That doesnât mean there arenât issues. On a technical level, I had several problems running games with the prerelease version of AMDâs drivers and its Adrenalin software. I also experienced buggy visuals, frame hitching, and occasional crashes in some games that I did not experience on Nvidiaâs latest cards, even with Team Green’s beta drivers. Those cards have their own litany of issuesâboth intended and unintendedâso Iâm not implying AMD is the only one with drawbacks. I tested the AMD GPUs on a system with an Intel CPU. I suspect AMD will play nicer with AMD’s chips, but thatâs no excuse.
With its rough edges sanded off, I can imagine the Radeon RX 9070 XT as the sleeper hit of the GPU release season. And I hope its a sleeper hit, since, if it gets too popular, we may have yet another stock SNAFU to whine about.
For review, AMD sent Gizmodo the XFX Swift AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT. Itâs a sleek-looking, three-fan card whose aesthetic is aided by an angled edge that made it appear like a mini skyscraper inside my test PC. It is also a big, big card. XFX’s version of the XT is a 3.5 slot GPU, meaning it takes up enough room on my PCâs motherboard to exclude an entire PCIe slot. I would suggest you take a look at various GPUs from the full range of OEMs (AMD partners with a variety of card makers) to make sure your PC case has enough room for both your new graphics card and extra drives you planned to slot in.
Both the RX 9070 and 9070 XT include 16 GB of GDDR6 memory with a 644.6 GB/s bandwidth. Both cards are based on the new RDNA 4 architecture. This is compared to Nvidiaâs Blackwell of the RTX 50-series, which is a port of the companyâs AI training chip architecture. RDNA is made up of compute units, though these have been redesigned for the new graphics hardware compared to past cards like the Radeon RX 7900 series. These new units should support higher clock speeds than RDNA 3, and they should be more power efficient to boot.
Both the 9070 and 9070 XT work on a PCIe 5.0 bus, though the more expensive card ups its boost clock speed to 2.9 GHz. Despite housing the same memory, AMDâs two latest graphics cards are very different in most ways that matter. The $600 graphics card has 64 compute units versus the 9070âs 56. That shows up in benchmarks, where the RX 9070 XT sees sizable uptick in graphical and AI performance. Good thing, then, that the capabilities of this card are just enough to make it nearly ideal for 4K gaming at a budget.
For $600, thereâs simply no comparison in performance between other GPUs for playing games at 4K. Itâs certainly better than the $550 AMD Radeon RX 7900 GRE from 2023, but more than that, it squeaks out playable framerates at or above the $750 Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti. I tested the card on an Origin PC Neuron 3500X config with an Intel Core Ultra 9 285K CPU and 32 GB of DDR5, 6400 MT/s RAM. Itâs the same PC I used to test all the Nvidia cards, so if youâre looking to see how well AMD does combined with Intelâs latest, keep reading.
Synthetic benchmarks like 3D Mark don’t give us a good idea of actual in-game performance, though it shows us what the hardware is capable of. In that way, RDNA 4 is surprisingly versatile. In our tests with 3D Mark Steel Nomad, the RX 9070 XT scored a little less than 200 points above the RTX 5070 Ti. The same canât be said for the card in tests that demand improved ray tracing performance. It scored 1,260 points worse in 3D Mark Port Royal and about 1,535 points worse in 3D Mark Speed Way.Â For AI performance, the RX 9070 XT managed to get a quantified score of 26645 in Geekbench AI, more than the RTX 5070 Tiâs 22022.
In our benchmarks with Cyberpunk 2077, the RX 9070 XT managed to effectively match the RTX 5070 Tiâs performance across our 4K tests without FSR, and managed similar results comparing DLSS 4 and FSR 4. It was a few frames shy of the 5070 Tiâs performance at 1080p, but it was still fully playable regardless. In Horizon Zero Dawn: Remastered, AMDâs $600 GPU topped Nvidiaâs sub-premium graphics card by a bare few percentage points, with or without AI upscaling at both 1080p and 4K.
Itâs not all good news. A game like Black Myth: Wukong notoriously plays worse with AMD cards than Nvidiaâs, and that remains true even when enabling FSR. At the highest settings and 4K, I couldnât manage to break 25 FPS with AMDâs upscaling, whereas the 5070 Ti could hit 52 FPS on average in benchmarks.
Letâs ignore static benchmarks for a moment and analyze the RX 9070 XT by how it does in recent games. In Avowed, playing in the most intensive regionâthe Emerald StairâI was averaging 50 to 53 FPS at 4K and ultra settings. In Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, I was sitting at around 55 FPS during the gameâs opening siege without FSR. With upscaling, I was getting around 80 FPS.
There were some games that performed even better than Nvidiaâs latest. Marvelâs Spider-Man 2 was an excellent experience at 4K, managing above 60 FPS despite the wild swings in performance typical of that game. I could not match that with either the RTX 5070 or RTX 5070 Ti. It’s as amazing as Peter Parker and Miles Morales themselves.
Then came other issues that made some titles unplayable. I experienced strong performance in Hogwarts Legacy, only to get random drops in FPS for no rhyme or reason, whether outdoors or indoors. I also had a very glitchy time trying to play Dragon Age: The Veilguard thanks to continuous frame hitching that made the opening area of the game unplayable. The problems I encountered were only in a select few titles, and I chalked them up to a driver issue. Still, AMD didnât offer me an idea what the issue may be in time for this review. Weâll be sure to check back to see if these issues get resolved in non-beta drivers.
AMDâs latest release not only needs to compete with Nvidia on specs and rendering performance, but it needed to hit back against Nvidiaâs upscaling tech. The answer is FSR 4, AKA FidelityFX Super Resolution. The new version of AMDâs upscaling tech is exclusive to the RDNA 4 cards, since it uses the GPUâs new AI accelerators baked into the architecture. This is supposed to offer less artifacting, less ghosting, and higher details for each upscaled frame.
The difference between running games with FSR 2 and FSR 3 is stark. The uplift in a FSR 2-supported game like Alan Wake II is many times less impressive than on a game like Marvelâs Spider-Man 2. For the latter, FSR 4 on balanced settings was how I could get it to play at 4K, ultra settings, and ray tracing turned up to high settings at or above 60 FPS. That was something I struggled to do on Nvidiaâs latest graphics cards.
While FSR 3.1 and earlier models were far more hardware-agnostic, FSR 4 depends on RDNA 4. In that way, itâs now a direct competitor with the exclusive nature of Nvidiaâs DLSS models. Earlier AMD Radeon cards wonât get access to FSR 4, either. The problem is, currently there are just over 30 games that support FSR 4. There are some big-name titles in there, like Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2, but the list is small compared to the around 75 games that supported DLSS 4 at launch. Nvidia has been adding more and more support to games over that time.
FSR support can be the make-or-break between whether a game is truly playable or not. Depending on what you were looking to play at max settings and 4K, owning a AMD or Nvidia GPU could be the difference between getting playable framerates or not.
AMD has said it has âtestedâ a multi-frame gen model but that it doesnât find it practical and that players donât see a need for it. While Nvidia has certainly gone out of its way to puff up the idea of âfakeâ frames as the future of gaming, multi-frame gen is still a great way for gamers with less-expensive PCs to make the most of their high-refresh rate monitors. DLSSâand FSR frame gen for that matterâwork best when youâre at or near 60 FPS already. Thatâs why the RTX 5070 proved a disappointment. It simply doesnât meet the needs of gamers who want to play at 4K. However, it’s more than capable of hitting solid framerates at 1440p. There’s a sick thrill of using DLSS 4 to push 60 or 70 FPS to 150 or higher. You won’t get that with AMD’s latest GPUs.
AMD’s graphics card costs $50 more than the RTX 5070 and the RX 9070 at its base price, effectively making both those cards superfluous in one fell swoop. Then the question is, whether to get the RTX 5070 Ti or the RX 9070 XT? Well, it may simply come down to availability. We wonât know what time has in store for AMDâs latest, but we can tell that unless something drastic happens, Nvidiaâs GPUs will continue to suffer from inflated prices and stock issues.
If youâre gunning for a new GPU now, and you canât wait for Nvidiaâs stock woes to end, the RX 9070 XT isnât just a stopgapâitâs the 4K upgrade you wanted. Will you miss out on DLSS 4 and the potential to do over 100 FPS in some games? Yes, you will. At a $150 to $300 discount compared to inflated GeForce prices, that sounds like a fair trade.

US stocks rebounded Wednesday on hopes that President Donald Trump's latest tariffs would prove short-lived, while European and Asian markets rallied as the Chinese and German governments signaled fresh support for their economies.

        As of 9:50 a.m. ET, the Samp;P 500 was up 0.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.1%.
    

        European stock markets were a sea of green with Germany's DAX rallying 3.2%, and both France's CAC 40 and the Euro Stoxx 50 gaining 1.6%.
    

        Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index closed 2.8% higher, while mainland China's CSI 300 closed 0.3% up, and the Hang Seng Tech Index gained 4%. Japan's Nikkei 225 ended 0.2% higher, and South Korea's Kospi index closed 1.2% up.
    

        After pausing his contentious plan for a month, Trump reimposed 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico on Tuesday.Trump has said the tariffs are intended to compel America's neighbors to stem the flow of drugs and crime into the US.
    

        Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox Business that Trump could announce tariff compromises with Canada and Mexico as early as Wednesday.
    

        He made the comments after US markets staggered and closed lower for a second consecutive session on Tuesday. The S&P 500 fell 1.2%, wiping out all its gains since November's presidential election, and the Nasdaq Composite flirted with a 10% decline from its most recent closing high before closing 0.4% lower.
    

        Lutnick said talks with Canada would most likely reduce some of the newly reimposed tariffs on imports from the two neighboring countries.
    

        ""Both the Mexicans and the Canadians are on the phone with me all day today, trying to show that they'll do better,"" he said, adding that Trump was ""listening"" and open to a middle-ground solution.
    

        Canada swiftly responded with 25% retaliatory tariffs. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said he'd cancel a $100 million deal with Starlink and remove US alcohol from shelves. He also threatened a 25% surcharge on electricity that Ontario sends to 1.5 million Americans.
    

        Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum meanwhile said retaliatory measures were ""going to wait"" because she planned to speak to Trump this week.
    

        While details of Trump's compromise remain unclear, Lutnick said it probably wouldn't be another tariff pause, but a more long-term deal.
    

        Trump spoke at length about tariffs during Tuesday's joint address to Congress.
    

        ""Countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them. It's very unfair,"" he said.
    

        Germany's political leaders announced Tuesday that they'd make three big changes to the ""debt brake"" that has limited government spending since the financial crisis.
    

        They earmarked 500 billion euros, or about 12% of GDP, for a 10-year infrastructure investment program, exempted defense spending above 1% of GDP, and reformed deficit constraints at the state level to give more flexibility to local authorities. Bank of America analysts called it a ""paradigm shift"" for the country's fiscal policy.
    

        The bump in Asian markets came after Chinese Premier Li Qiang signaled confidence in his country's economy even amid heightened trade tensions with the US.
    

        On Tuesday, China announced a GDP growth target of ""around 5%"" in a government work report delivered by Li at the National People's Congress in Beijing.
    

        China is also raising its fiscal deficit to 4% of GDP, from 3% the year before.
    

        ""Internationally, changes unseen in a century are unfolding across the world at a faster pace,"" Li said in his speech at the opening of the congress.
    

        Analysts say the economic work plan is largely in line with market expectations.
    

        ""Repeating the 'around 5%' growth target, despite a more challenging external environment is, in our view, a show of confidence and a harbinger of stronger policy support for domestic demand,"" wrote Lynn Song, ING's chief economist for Greater China, in a Tuesday note.
    

        Despite investors' sighs of relief, Trump is probably just getting started with the trade action.
    

        ""I am confident that the bulk of the tariff developments still lie ahead. I think what we've seen so far is really just the beginning and I think the President is just getting started at this point,"" Jeff Gerrish, the deputy US trade representative during Trump's first term, said on a Goldman Sachs podcast uploaded on Tuesday.
    

        Gerrish said he'd monitor the Trump-ordered US trade policy review. The reports from the review, which are expected on April 1, could lead to ""a whole host of tariff actions,"" Gerrish said.
    

        On Tuesday, Trump acknowledged in his presidential address that tariffs could be disruptive.
    

        ""Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again. And it's happening, and it will happen rather quickly,"" Trump said. ""There'll be a little disturbance, but we're OK with that. It won't be much.""
    

        On the same day, new US tariffs against imports from Canada, China, and Mexico took effect. Canada and China announced retaliatory tariffs in response.
    

Economists have warned that additional costs from the US tariffs would most likely be passed on to American consumers rather than to foreign exporters.

Elon Musk told investors to expect Tesla sales to grow this year — but plummeting sales in a number of countries are complicating that goal.

        While Tesla's Model Y continues to be a top seller and UK sales were up in February, some of Tesla's sales figures in other markets looked grim — the kind of year-over-year drops that should worry the CEO.
    

        Tesla sales in February declined 71% year over year in Australia, according to figures from the Electric Vehicle Council. The EV giant sold 1,592 vehicles in Australia last month, down from 5,665 in February the year prior.
    

        Tesla Rival Polestar sold 125 vehicles last month, which was also a decline of 11%.
    

        The decline of Tesla sales in Australia this month comes amid vandalism in the country aimed at Musk. A Tesla store in Hobart, the capital of Tasmania, was vandalized with graffiti, news.com.au reported this week.
    

        Tesla's sales in Germany last month were down by 76% year over year, with 1,429 vehicles sold. Germany's Federal Motor Transport Authority said overall EV sales in the country grew by about 31%.
    

        Tesla's sales in the country also fell in January, when Musk endorsed the far-right AfD party ahead of a February 23 election.
    

        Tesla sales declined in several other European countries last month.
    

        In February, Tesla sales in Norway and Denmark were down by 48% year over year.
    

        Sales in Sweden declined by 42% year over year.
    

        Tesla sales in France last month declined by 26% year over year: It sold 2,395 vehicles, though that was an increase from 1,141 Teslas sold in January. The country also experienced an overall decline in car sales of 0.7%, Plateforme Automobile said.
    

January Tesla registrations in the US fell 11% year over year, according to data from S&P Global Mobility. While sales were down, Tesla still has a leading market share in the US with 42% of total EV sales, according to the data.
    

        However, Tesla's decline came as its rivals saw an increase. Ford's EV registrations surged 54% from the year prior, and Chevrolet and VW also saw increases, S&P Global Mobility said. Tesla still sold 35,000 more EVs than Ford last month.
    

        Slumping sales in the US come as a series of recent anti-Musk protests and boycott efforts have been aimed at Tesla in response to the billionaire's political involvement. A number of vandalism incidents involving Molotov cocktails, suspected arson, and gunfire have also taken place, with some leading to arrests.
    

        Sales of Teslas manufactured in China also took a hit in February. The EV giant sold 30,688 China-made vehicles, its lowest number since August 2022. That represented a 49% drop year over year in China. Tesla's Chinese rival BYD recorded a 90.4% increase in vehicle sales that month.
    

Tesla's stock dropped by about 4% in early trading on Tuesday but has since leveled out. However, after surging in the wake of Donald Trump's presidential victory, Tesla shares are still trading down about 36% year to date.
    

        Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.
    

        While Tesla has faced increasing competition in the EV market in recent years, some investors have expressed concerns that Tesla could be struggling in part because of Musk's involvement in global politics and position in the Trump administration with DOGE.
    

        In recent weeks, several ""Tesla Takedown"" protests have occurred in various cities in response to his political involvement, with demonstrators urging Tesla owners to sell their vehicles.
    

        In an apparent effort to boost sales of its most expensive Cybertruck models, which cost nearly $100,000, Tesla is offering free charging for the entire period of ownership.

11,2025-03-05,"Palantir’s stock trades at a “frothy” multiple, but one former critic says his view on valuation has evolved somewhat."

French satellite provider Eutelsat's shares have skyrocketed amid concerns that Ukraine's access to Starlink may be under threat.

        Eutelsat shares on the Paris exchange surged 68% on Monday before jumping another 123% the next morning to $4.77.
    

        By Wednesday at market close, the stock had reached $8.34 — a 533% jump from the start of the week. With that increase, the company is worth $4.02 billion.
    

        The leap comes as the US suspended aid to Ukraine on Monday, prompting fears of disruptions to capabilities like advanced American air defenses and internet access on the battlefield.
    

        Starlink, owned by Elon Musk's SpaceX, has been a vital internet provider for Ukraine's military, and the loss of its services would be a severe blow to Kyiv's communications and drone operations.
    

        That's key for Eutelsat, which merged with a UK-based Starlink competitor, OneWeb, in 2023.
    

        The satellite firm has come to the fore as European leaders say they're bolstering defense spending while raising the possibility that they could seek to fill any gaps in Ukraine's internet access.
    

        As its share price rose, a spokesperson for the company told Reuters it was discussing with the European Union how it might contribute to Ukraine's internet access.
    

        In a statement to Business Insider, a spokesperson for Eutelsat said the company ""offers the same capabilities as Starlink in terms of coverage and latency"" in Europe.
    

        ""We are actively collaborating with European institutions and business partners to enable the swift deployment of additional user terminals for critical missions and infrastructure,"" the spokesperson said.
    

        Despite the jump this week, Eutelstat's shares are still far below its past highs. Its stock reached about $33 in mid-2015 and has steadily declined in the last decade.
    

        The company suffered as its legacy operations, which relied more heavily on satellites in Earth's higher orbit, were increasingly eclipsed by the growing popularity of low-Earth-orbit satellites like Starlink's.
    

        However, Eutelsat's recent merger with OneWeb now gives it a constellation of low-Earth orbit satellites to compete with.
    

        Meanwhile, it's unclear whether Ukraine's Starlink access is at risk.
    

        Musk, a close ally of President Donald Trump, denied a Reuters report from late February that said US officials discussed cutting off Starlink from Kyiv if it rejected a minerals deal with Washington.
    

        And while the US partially pays for Ukraine's Starlink subscription, European countries also fund many terminals. Poland, which pays for about half of Ukraine's Starlink terminals, said it would continue to fund them.
    

        Through OneWeb, Eutelsat is also already providing some satellite services to Ukraine's governments and institutions, but it only has about one-tenth of Starlink's satellites. Its constellation has fewer than 700 satellites, while Starlink runs over 7,000.
    

        The European company operates 35 Geo satellites, which orbit at 21,000 miles above Earth, and about 630 low-Earth orbit satellites, which orbit at about 750 miles above Earth.
    

        While internet terminals typically rely on low-earth orbit satellites because they are closer to Earth's surface, Eutelsat's spokesperson told BI that the 35 Geo satellites could also help bolster Ukraine's internet capacity.
    

        On Sunday, European Commission spokesperson Thomas Regnier told reporters regional leaders were considering giving Ukraine access to GovSatCom as an alternative.
    

        The system is a shared network of satellites already owned by European member states.
    

        Eutelsat's momentary stock boost also comes as European defense manufacturing shares surged due to the recent strain on US relations with its traditional allies and Ukraine.
    

        Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, announced on Tuesday that European leaders would push to allocate 800 billion euros, or about $840 billion, to their defense spending collectively.
    

March 5, 2025: This story was updated to reflect a comment from Eutelsat and the company's share price on Wednesday.

The former CEO of Kroger forfeited more than $11 million when he resigned from the grocery chain this week following an investigation into his personal conduct.

        Kroger's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show that McMullen left behind $11.2 million in a potential bonus as well as stock and options when he left the company.
    

        Without that compensation, McMullen still owned 6.6 million shares of Kroger, worth roughly $417 million at Tuesday's closing price.
    

        According to an SEC filing, McMullen had total compensation as CEO of $15.7 million in 2023 and $19.2 million in 2022.
    

        Kroger said on Monday that McMullen had resigned after an investigation into his ""personal conduct.""
    

        The company provided few details but said it found that some of his actions were ""inconsistent with Kroger's Policy on Business Ethics."" Kroger said McMullen's actions weren't connected to other Kroger associates or the company's financial performance.
    

        McMullen was appointed Kroger's CEO in 2014. For two years he oversaw the chain's proposed $24.6 billion merger with Albertsons, which fell apart in December.

14,2025-03-05,"Six weeks into his presidency, Donald Trump came to a US Capitol controlled by his Republican Party to take a lengthy victory lap.
""We have accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplished in four years or eight years, and we are just getting started,"" he told the joint session of Congress.
In typical Trumpian hyperbole, he said that ""many"" believed his to be the most successful start to a presidency in US history. He noted what he said was a change in the national mood toward ""pride"" and ""confidence"". He compared himself to George Washington, and boasted about the size of his electoral victory.
The whirlwind start to his presidency offered plenty of material for Trump to cover, and he didn't shy away from it. 
He ticked through a lengthy list of tangible accomplishments – hundreds of executive orders and actions, a freeze on foreign aid, lower levels of illegal border crossing, and the withdrawal from international organisations and agreements. 
He also spoke at length about his ban on transgender athletes in women's sports and moves to get ""woke ideology"" out of US schools and the military. 
""Wokeness is trouble. Wokeness is bad. It's gone, it's gone, and we feel so much better for it, don't we?""
Meanwhile, Democrats – who filled up half the audience in the House chamber – sat in icy silence, as the president repeatedly blamed them, former President Joe Biden and ""radical left lunatics"" for all the nation's ills.
Several dozen responded by holding up small black signs with words like ""false"" and ""lies"".
The president seemed to enjoy putting the ""bully"" in the presidential bully pulpit.
He needled his political adversaries, mocking their refusal to cheer his remarks, dusting off his ""Pocahontas"" nickname for Massachusetts Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, and wryly noting that attempts to prosecute him ""didn't work out"" for his opponents.
Texas congressman Al Green was not around to see any of that, however. 
At the very start of Trump's speech, the Democrat had harangued the president, his mostly inaudible comments punctuated with repeated thrusts of his cane. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson called for decorum and the House Sergeant-at-Arms escorted the congressman from the chamber.
Green would tell reporters outside the Capitol that he was protesting proposed cuts to the government-run Medicaid health insurance for low-income Americans.
After about half an hour of touting his opening actions, Trump turned to the tasks he still needed to accomplish. That made up the bulk of a speech that stretched for more than an hour and 40 minutes. It was standard presidential address fare, and Trump's rhetorical flourishes began to blur together.
While he said ""small business optimism"" was up, he blamed Biden for the current state of the economy – including high egg prices. He promised to ""rescue"" the economy and make getting ""dramatic and immediate relief to working families"" his highest priority.
He called out Elon Musk in the audience, and said his Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) would reduce inflation by cutting wasteful spending and fraud, prompting him to recite a laundry list of purported examples in foreign aid and other government programmes.
Trump leaned heavily into promises of further progress on immigration enforcement and offered an animated defence of his tariff policies, saying that they were ""protecting the soul of our country"", even if most economists warn they will lead to higher prices for American consumers. 
The president acknowledged that adding a tax on imported goods from Canada, Mexico and China might cause a ""disturbance"" and that US farmers might feel a ""period of indigestion"". 
But nothing in his comments suggested that he was backing away from a budding trade war that has roiled the stock market in recent days - in fact, he promised to move forward with reciprocal tariffs on all US trade partners next month.
Trump once again promised to balance the budget, prompting a round of applause from Republican legislators. He provided no details about the kind of steep cuts such a promise would require, however.
In fact, he quickly turned to discussing the tax cuts he hopes Congress will enact – including his campaign promises of no taxes on tips, overtime or Social Security. Any of those, if enacted, would add hundreds of billions of dollars to the current nearly $2tn budget deficit.
Foreign policy is rarely front and centre in these presidential addresses, and that was the case this time despite how Trump has shaken up global politics in the first weeks of his second term.  
He repeated his desire for an American annexation of Greenland, promised American control of the Panama Canal and only made brief mention of Gaza and the Middle East.
The president spoke more extensively about negotiating with Russia for peace in Ukraine. And he took pleasure in reading from a letter he said he'd just received from Volodymyr Zelensky - which was similar to a message the Ukrainian leader posted on X earlier in the day. 
""He said: 'My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts. We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence.'
Trump added that Zelensky had said he was ready to sign an agreement on minerals and security ""at any time that is convenient for you"". 
""I appreciate that,"" Trump told the chamber, offering a hint of a possible cooling of the acrimony between the two leaders.
By the time Trump wrapped up and Democrats practically sprinted for the exits, his speech had set a modern record for the longest presidential address to Congress. Much like the first six weeks of Trump's presidency, there was plenty for his supporters to love, and lots for his critics – at least those who tuned in – to jeer.

My 100"" U8 HiSense TV is the best TV I've ever bought. I had to finally replace my 1080i projector in the movie room and wanted more responsiveness for gaming and modern 4k projectors are very expensive. I got the TV for $1800 on sale a few years back.
The first thing it asks when you turn it on is if you want a smart TV with Google or a dumb TV. I picked dumb and it was just that, HDMI ports and nothing else. Works great with my PS5 and AppleTV. I was so worried about a 'cheapTV' and I don't think I'll spend the money on Samsung/LG again.
I saw this headline before any comments and thought ""wait, didn't Walmart just recently announce plans to outright buy one of the brands whose TVs they sell?""  So I checked and they did, but that was Vizio, not TCL, so I decided to let it lie rather than being the first commenter.  But yes, certainly, TCL is a brand I associate with Walmart.
My next ""TV"" will be a large computer monitor.My current computer monitor is a 55-inch TV.
My next ""TV"" will be a large computer monitor.
My current computer monitor is a 55-inch TV.
I've always thought TCL's blocky ASCII-based faux graphics look pretty awful. It's hard to imagine a television show or movie being acceptably rendered in Tk. And intentionally buying a TV with that? Fuggetaboutit.
*angrily moderates parent +1, Funny*
I was expecting to see a discussion about TCL in the TIOBE index, but instead all I find is some discussion about TVs.

In any case, TCL make some well-known TV types (or parts thereof), they just don't have the TCL name on them: Samsung, Sony, RCA, etc.
Their high end models seem to get decent reviews. The leaders are still LG and Panasonic, but with TCL you get 97% of image quality for 50% of the price.
They also make OLED panels using an inkjet printing technology that they developed. TVs with them are due this year, but I'm looking forward to computer monitors with them. So far all the OLED ones are either 1440p or 32"" or both. A nice 28"" 4k OLED would be great, and TCL makes just such a panel.
Watch digital trends channel. Apparently they even have like a 115in display.
I think LG left that legacy behind awhile back. Keep in mind until recently all OLED TVs (the opposite of ""bottom-rate"" TVs) were using panels made by LG.
I was pretty sure Sony was making their own OLED panel.
Last year's Bravia 8 was an LG panel [oled-info.com], it looks like the A95K used a Samsung panel [whathifi.com]. But generally all Sony OLED TVs (and most other brands) are all using LG panels. It's Sony's picture processing that sets it apart in picture quality.
Sony's own OLEDs are used in medical displays and other fields now, not consumer TV sets.
IIRC, Lucky was a chemical company while Goldstar was the electronics and components division that combined into a conglomerate like Korean companies tend to do. Goldstar wasn't in and of itself necessarily a ""mark of the beast"" absolute junk tier company. It's just that once they made it to the world market as something other than the underlying OEM badged as some other legacy prestige brand, their name was on things like VCRs when DVDs were starting to give way to Bluray. This is precisely why they had to 
Goldstar stuff absolutely was disposable crap.
I've owned a bunch of LG stuff over the years, and I hated most of it, but I have a 43"" 4K LG TV right now. This TV is not too bad, although I've heard that this generation of TV got stuffed with ads you cannot turn off by an update. I have never connected it to any network. The panel is OK. It has a sharp light dropoff around the last couple of edge pixels though, and the interface is horribly laggy and the menu interface is needlessly deep and irritating. It u 
I think my folks had a Goldstar microwave when I was growing up...
LG's washers/dryers, at least, work very well and are extremely reliable. We've certainly been happy with ours (which we bought after a lot of research).
As an aside... I find it weird that these brands can consistently excel in one particular appliance category, yet somehow that doesn't hold across the entire brand. LG's refrigerators are not nearly as high quality as their laundry equipment. Or Bosch, for example - absolutely the best dishwashers available, but most of their other stuff is only fair-to-middling.
I don’t know what your boat are you on the durability of LG for appliances? I’m in the market for an induction stove and I’m focusing currently on Bosch and GE. Everything in the last five years in the appliance world has told me run screaming away from Samsung. Apparently their appliances not only are prone to breaking down, but the support from Samsung is just the absolute worst. When it comes to a stove/range I need something that’s going to last 20 years. The GE profile ceramic s 
Oh my God, Siri just totally butchered that first sentence right as I hit submit. I asked how are you with the knowledge of the durability of LG appliances? A boat? Seriously Siri?
The Consumer Reports user survey lists LG as the most reliable brand for both washers and dryers (this was the same back when we bought ours several years ago). Other reviews I found online, back when we were shopping, backed that up.
One thing I'm finding that's annoying with Consumer Reports is - they've redesigned how they display info, and now it's much harder to find overall brand reliability (not just for washers and dryers - for everything). They still list it with each review and rating... but they u 
""Reliability"" means ""repair frequency"", if that's not clear.
Our LG washing machine has been awesome too - 11 years and still truckin' like we just bought it. I will mention that the first one we had was DOA, but was quickly replaced with the one we have now.
Bosch - they're good for car parts, and some power tools (my Bosch orbital sander is brilliant, for example). Can't speak to much else from them though.
Electrolux - avoid. They make ""premium looking"" stuff, but it's awful. One little problem and you have to junk the whole thing because they made it all fragile an 
Bosch hasn't been good for car parts since 1998, when they stopped making the P7100 injection pump. They also were instrumental in the German diesel cheating scandal.
Another AI article....???
AIstroturfing, when you're so cheap you can't even pay for influencers to carpet bomb us with bullshit. I've never even heard of TCL, but looking at the nationality of the brand... yeah, it's bullshit.
I've never even heard of TCLYou obviously don't shop for TVs at Walmart.

When I clicked this article there were no comments on here yet. The reason my comment is 5th on here is I needed over an hour to stop laughing at the assertion that TCL is a premium brand.
RTINGs are generally pretty reliable, and other reviewers seem to agree with them: https://www.rtings.com/tv/revi... [rtings.com]
They note that TCL's high end sets have excellent colour reproduction and brightness for HDR, as well as great anti-glare coatings and extremely low latency for gaming, even at 4k. They also support high refresh rates.
Perhaps even more interesting is that their mid range models have most of the same features as the high end ones, they are just a little less bright (but still more than adequate for most uses). A lot of Chinese brands do that, TP Link being another good example. Even the low end models get all the software features, they don't disable them just to differentiate the product tiers even when the hardware is capable.
Not all of their production lines are mid range.  There’s a YouTube channel called digital trends that fills you in on all the new models of TVs from different manufacturers.  However, you’re not going to wander through Walmart or target and see these models.  I bet you did not know there is a 115 inch TV made by TCL.
Premium? Id's say ""creamium"".
Never come across TCL anywhere in Oklahoma (USA). What/Who are we talking about? Have I been blinded of something better than the others?
Really? They carry them at Wal-Mart.Maybe you're more familiar with their language and GUI toolkit: TCL/Tk?

I've been out of the TV market for nearly 2 decades and recently looked for a new set, TCL was being heavily pushed but what I really want is a dumb TV with a good panel and a few HDMI ports. However getting a 50"" 4K non-smart TV in the UK is like searching for rocking horse poo.

They get paid for the junk.
Not enough people are willing to pay extra for no junk.
I had a Vizio, it was fantastic, it was almost a dumb TV, but you could airplay or Chromecast to it. Then, 18 months later an update made it a full on smart TV and now it sucks. It's super unreliable on casting making me navigate through the apps I hate it.
The HDR on my TCL set is so bad I had to turn it off.

The home projector field is competitive, so a new contender offering a 120-inch display, 4K resolution with HDR support, and lighting-fast refresh rates makes for an alluring prospect. That Philips is promising all that for under $1,000—and almost half that on preorder—almost sounds too good to be true.
Philips hasn't been quite as big a player in the projection game as some of its rivals, with its range focused on the broadly entry-level NeoPix models and the ultrashort-throw Screeneo laser projectors. The GamePix 900 is something new, emphasizing improved gaming performance even at gigantic scale. It boasts latencies as rapid as 6 milliseconds—essential for fast-paced gameplay where you want as little input lag from controller-to-screen as possible—and refresh rates as high as 240 Hz, and it comes with three dedicated display presets: Action Gaming, Adventure Gaming, and Sports Gaming, each tailored for best results in such genres.
Anyone who pays attention to the gaming market will likely know that a consistent high frame rate at 4K (or higher) resolution is a bit of a holy grail, something even some of the best monitors struggle to deliver without breaking the bank. Even then, the console or PC running the game needs to be powerful enough to push out ultra high-res frames quickly enough to take advantage of a fast screen. Typically, you'll end up in a middle ground, such as the Samsung Odyssey G6 OLED, which offers an insanely fast 360-Hz refresh rate but a sub-4K display resolution of 2,560 x 1,440.
Achieving all that, and at this price, is where those few sacrifices come in, as the GamePix 900 is undeniably bare-bones in almost every other respect. Its design is basic, a svelte but uninspiring matte black cuboid (8.6 x 8.6 x 4.7 inches, weighing in at 4.4 pounds), and it has only one adjustable leg to tinker with its physical orientation and throw angle.
The GamePix 900 finds itself doing some crafty number-wrangling to justify its lofty specs. While the projector is indeed capable of hitting those buttery-smooth 240-Hz refresh rates and nigh-imperceptible 6-millisecond latencies, it only does so at 1080p resolution. If you want to play anything in actual 4K—3,840 x 2,160p—then the refresh rate and latency drop accordingly.
The trade-off is more than worth it. Playing the likes of Marvel Rivals blown up to wall size, at competitive speed with essentially no noticeable lag is a fantastic experience, even if “only” in 1080p HD.
Still, few owners are likely to use a projector purely for gaming, and overall picture quality proves to be a bit of a secret weapon for the GamePix 900. Both 4K Blu-rays and 4K streamed content from Netflix and Disney+ (all played through a connected PS5) look crystal clear, even at that maximum 120-inch projection.

While this rig only supports HDR 10, rather than the technically superior Dolby Vision format, colors dazzle too (Philips cites a 95 percent Rec. 709 color gamut), with a richness and warmth that makes images pop. This feels particularly notable with animated content—Studio Ghibli's The Boy and the Heron, played from 4K UHD, looked nothing short of phenomenal coming out of this projector.
Any games that aren't being played at competition level—so not requiring that 6-millisecond latency—can take advantage of the full 4K display. Surviving the ruined world of The Last of Us Part II or bouncing around Astro Bot's joyful cartoon planets has rarely looked so good, especially on this scale. Hooking up a Nintendo Switch, which only has a maximum output resolution of 1080p anyway, looked glorious across the board.
The only areas where the GamePix 900 really struggles visually are in brightness and black levels. Its 1,000 ANSI lumens output (from an LED bulb with a stated 30,000-hour lifetime) isn't quite powerful enough to make the display stand out in anything other than a darkened room.
Just a bit of ambient light can prove a problem—testing out The Goonies on 4K in the middle of the day made for a washed-out viewing experience, even with curtains closed. And, while no projector can match the true blacks of an OLED panel, darker onscreen areas here can sometimes look a little too muddy or gray, although that can sometimes be mitigated by tweaking the contrast settings. Account for those factors, though, and this really does feel as though it's punching above its weight on the visual front. Frankly, all but the staunchest of home cinema snobs are likely to be at least a little bit impressed by what this puts out.
On the audio front, matters are a bit less exciting, but not disappointing. An internal 5-watt speaker, aided by a sound chamber, is more than up to the job of providing good enough audio in a home setting. There's not much in the way of acoustic nuance—don't expect great treble or bass—but it creates a convincing illusion of directionality. A 3.5-mm audio out jack allows room for improvement here too.
Video input is limited to a single HDMI port, which means swapping cords around regularly if you want to use more than one device with it. It does, at least, have a USB-A power-out port though, allowing TV sticks to be powered by the projector itself—useful, since this also lacks any form of wireless connectivity. That means no built-in streaming apps, no Bluetooth pairing, no way to cast devices to the projector, nothing. This may be another area where targeting gamers comes in handy though—if you have an Xbox or PlayStation connected, you can access all your media apps through that anyway.

Similarly, almost all of its lens functions are entirely physical and can only be adjusted manually. The thrown screen size—from a minimum 60 inches to that wall-dominating 120 inches—is altered by turning one dial on the lens itself, the focus of the image by sliding another. There's no automatic keystone detection or correction either, meaning you have to fiddle with the equally bare-bones remote to create a perfectly even-sided frame. If you're setting the GamePix up once and not moving it, this won't be a problem, but otherwise it's a bit annoying.
More frustrating is that whenever you switch to one of the gaming presets—which are effectively this projector's raison d'être—you're met with a message informing you that “the keystone, aspect ratio, overscan, zoom functions will be reset to default.” This, along with a tendency to automatically drop resolution to 1080p if it can't match a higher frame rate for 4K output (for instance, if a PS5's 120-Hz setting is activated in the console settings) can mean regular menu diving to make sure you're getting the picture quality and presentation that you want.
While that might be a deal breaker on a higher-end model, the picture-quality-to-price ratio of the GamePix 900 earns it a lot of forgiveness. At its $999/£819 MSRP, the GamePix 900 is already a strong competitor in its bracket. If you can snag it at its preorder price, this 4K projector is almost a no-brainer. While it's unlikely to replace anyone's main TV—especially during daylight hours—the sheer spectacle of having a 120-inch, 4K HDR screen makes it hard to beat for game or movie nights.

17,2025-03-05,"Cheap TV streaming boxes seem like one of the most straightforward gadgets out there, but they can come with hidden costs. In 2023, researchers revealed that tens of thousands of Android TV boxes being used in homes, schools, and businesses were equipped with secret backdoors that allowed them to be used in a host of cybercrime and online fraud. Now, the same researchers have found that the China-based ecosystem behind the compromised devices and the illicit activities they’re used for—collectively dubbed Badbox 2.0—is fueling a next-generation campaign that’s broader in scope and even more sneaky.
At least 1 million Android-based TV streaming boxes, tablets, projectors, and after-sale car infotainment systems are infected with malware that conscripts them into a scammer-controlled botnet, according to new research shared exclusively with WIRED by the cybersecurity firm Human Security. The compromised devices are used for a range of advertising fraud and in so-called residential proxy services, which allow their operators to use victim internet connections for routing and masking web traffic. And all of this activity happens behind the scenes without the owners of compromised devices having any idea of how their streaming boxes are being used.
“This is all completely unbeknownst to the poor users that have bought this device just to watch Netflix or whatever,” Gavin Reid, Human’s chief information security officer, tells WIRED. “Ad fraud including click fraud is all happening behind the scenes, but the main way they are monetizing the million devices is reselling this proxy service. Victims don't know that they're a proxy, they never agreed to be a proxy service, but they're being used for that. Any bad thing you want to do, scraping, whatever it is, these proxy services are an enabler for that.”
The researchers found that the majority of infected devices are in South America, particularly Brazil. The impacted devices often use generic names and aren’t produced by known brands. For example, there are dozens of impacted streaming boxes, but the majority of Badbox 2.0 targets are in the “TV98” and “X96” device families. Virtually all of the targeted devices are designed using Android’s open source operating system code, meaning they run versions of Android but aren’t part of Google’s ecosystem of protected devices.
Google collaborated with the researchers to address the ad fraud component of the activity, though. The company says it worked to terminate publisher accounts associated with the scams and block the ability of those accounts to generate revenue through Google’s advertising ecosystem.
“Malicious attacks like the one described in this report are expressly prohibited on our platforms,” Google spokesperson Nate Funkhouser told WIRED in a statement. “Bad actors’ tactics are constantly evolving. Partnering with organizations like HUMAN helps us share threat intelligence and expands our collective ability to identify and take swift action against bad actors, as we did here.”
In the original Badbox campaign, scammers focused on installing backdoored firmware in streaming boxes before they arrived in the hands of consumers. The Badbox 2.0 campaign is significant, the researchers say, because it reflects a major change in tactics. Rather than focusing on low-level firmware infections, Badbox 2.0 involves more traditional software-level malware distributed through common tactics like drive-by downloads, in which victims accidentally download malware without realizing it.
Researchers from multiple firms say that the campaign seems to come from a loosely connected ecosystem of fraud groups rather than one single actor. Each group has its own versions of the Badbox 2.0 backdoor and malware modules and distributes the software in a variety of ways. In some cases, malicious apps come preinstalled on compromised devices, but in many examples that the researchers tracked, attackers are tricking users into unknowingly installing compromised apps.
The researchers highlight a technique in which the scammers create a benign app—say, a game—post it in Google's Play Store to show that it’s been vetted, but then trick users into downloading nearly identical versions of the app that are not hosted in official app stores and are malicious. Such “evil twin” apps showed up at least 24 times, the researchers say, allowing the attackers to run ad fraud in the Google Play versions of their apps, and distribute malware in their imposter apps. Human also found that the scammers distributed over 200 compromised, re-bundled versions of popular, mainstream apps as yet another way of spreading their backdoors.
“We saw four different types of fraud modules—two ad fraud ones, one fake click one, and then the residential proxy network one—but it's extensible,” says Lindsay Kaye, Human’s vice president of threat intelligence. “So you can imagine how, if time had gone on and they were able to develop more modules, maybe forge more relationships, there is the opportunity to have additional ones.”
Researchers from the security firm Trend Micro collaborated with Human on the Badbox 2.0 investigation, particularly focusing on the actors behind the activity.
“The scale of the operation is huge,” says Fyodor Yarochkin, a Trend Micro senior threat researcher. He added that while there are “easily up to a million devices online” for any of the groups, “This is only a number of devices that are currently connected to their platform. If you count all the devices that would probably have their payload, it probably would be exceeding a few millions.”
Yarochkin adds that many of the groups involved in the campaigns seem to have some connection to Chinese gray market advertising and marketing firms. More than a decade ago, Yarochkin explains, there were multiple legal cases in China in which companies had installed “silent” plugins on devices and used them for a diverse array of seemingly fraudulent activity.
“The companies that basically survived that age of 2015 were the companies who adapted,” Yarochkin says. He notes that his investigations have now identified multiple “business entities” in China which appear to be linked back to some of the groups involved in Badbox 2. The connections include both economic and technical links. “We identified their addresses, we’ve seen some pictures of their offices, they have accounts of some employees on LinkedIn,” he says.
Human, Trend Micro, and Google also collaborated with the internet security group Shadow Server to neuter as much Badbox 2.0 infrastructure as possible by sinkholing the botnet so it essentially sends its traffic and requests for instructions into a void. But the researchers caution that after scammers pivoted following revelations about the original Badbox scheme, it’s unlikely that exposing Badbox 2.0 will permanently end the activity.
“As a consumer, you should keep in mind that if the device is too cheap to be true, you should be prepared that there might be some additional surprises hidden in the device,” Trend Micro’s Yarochkin says. “There is no free cheese unless the cheese is in a mousetrap.”

When Lissy Von Schwarzkopf and I met on a video call in mid-February, she offered an apology within seconds.

        As the chief business officer of Karla Otto, a global brand-building agency with luxury clients such as Nike, Valentino, and Loewe, Von Schwarzkopf's schedule is hectic, especially during the slew of first-quarter fashion weeks. Consequently, our meeting had to be pushed back from its initial time slot.
    

        ""I have to apologize. We had a bit of a crazy morning with a big client announcement,"" she said.
    

        The announcement was that Nike and Kim Kardashian's Skims label were joining forces to create a womenswear brand called NikeSkims. The collaboration could be a game changer in the activewear space — and for Nike as it combats declining sales.
    

        Von Schwarzkopf said NikeSkims, set to launch in April, exemplifies a marketing strategy that capitalizes on the combined renown of two major brands. This gives both businesses ""a huge advantage because you're tapping into a whole new community and a whole new audience,"" she said.
    

Profit slumps hit some of the biggest high-end retailers last year, and the trend will likely persist. The luxury slowdown is forcing brands to rethink every facet of their business models, including their marketing strategies. As consumers clutch their dollars, upscale labels like Nike hope to loosen the grip by refining how they communicate their brand identity.
    

        ""Diamonds are made under pressure,"" Hannah Reed, a research manager at the market-research agency Walnut Unlimited, said. ""The pressure is now on for luxury players, and hopefully, it'll be a time where they innovate and come back bigger and stronger.""
    

        Kubi Springer, the global marketing director of Avantgarde Brand Experience, a global brand-experience agency, put it frankly: ""Brands evolve or they die,"" she said. ""That is the reality.""
    

        Crafting resilient marketing strategies for luxury fashion requires a deep understanding of the economic forces shaping the industry.
    

        Reed and Springer cited several factors contributing to luxury's waning momentum: In the US and the UK, inflation, higher taxes, and the rising cost of living have reduced consumer spending. Meanwhile, in China, a real estate crisis has affected spending power.
    

        Reed said there's also a ""reputation recession"" as shoppers notice a drop in the quality of luxury products while their prices skyrocket.
    

        President Donald Trump's big tariff push has luxury stakeholders feeling antsy as well.
    

        ""Everyone's on the edge of their seats at the moment, wondering what the trade tariffs will mean long term,"" Reed said. ""It puts pressure on supply chains, so if you are based in Europe or Asia, those additional costs could add up to millions for luxury players.""
    

        Consumers, especially aspirational shoppers, are also shifting their spending habits and priorities. They're opting for secondhand shopping and choosing travel, dining, and other experiences over high-end-fashion purchases. In response, Von Schwarzkopf said, major fashion groups are cashing in on hospitality and travel-related ventures.
    

        There's a caveat, though. While luxury markets in China and Western regions have generally decelerated, the Middle East, India, and Africa are seeing an upward trend.
    

        An October report from Henley & Partners and New World Wealth forecast that more than 800 millionaires would relocate from Britain to the United Arab Emirates by the end of 2024 — partially because of changes to the UK's tax system. Springer said: ""We're seeing places like Nigeria and Ghana getting an influx of people coming from the West, too, and that's impacting how luxury goods are selling.""
    

        Sade Teyibo, the founder of Fola PR, a communications and brand-development agency, has also noticed this shift.
    

        ""There are so many brands that want to tap into what's happening in Africa,"" said Teyibo, whose company is based in Lagos, Nigeria. ""There's a cultural renaissance. We're at the center of fashion, music, design, and art.""
    

        Fola PR, which also operates in New York, primarily works with African companies, creatives, and entrepreneurs, helping them elevate their brands through partnerships, luxury product launches, and bespoke events. It also works with global brands that want to expand their reach into Africa.
    

        Springer said that luxury retailers needed to consider all these factors to position themselves favorably in front of consumers and survive the slowdown. Here's how they can craft and market a durable brand identity amid economic uncertainty.
    

        Karla Otto has an in-house insights and analytics division that researches market and consumer trends, including influencer and sentiment data. It also offers bespoke reports and consulting services and publishes multiple industry white papers per year.
    

        Its latest report, ""Luxury's Great Reset,"" published in December, detailed key components it said would affect the luxury sector in the coming years. It forecast that community-driven campaigns and craftsmanship would be among the critical drivers of luxury goods purchases between now and 2027.
    

        ""Research is the starting point for everything that we do,"" Von Schwarzkopf said. ""It influences all of our strategies that we bring back to our clients.""
    

        The key to building a creative strategy around data-driven research, she added, is to find a cultural, human-interest angle within the numbers. ""Most of our brands have that interest in being a player in culture,"" though which cultural ""playing field"" needs to be carefully defined, she said.
    

        ""The growth and demand around personalization is something that luxury brands need to take heed of,"" Springer said. On a basic level, that means analyzing shoppers' data to understand their behaviors and needs — but ""personalization needs to go beyond that,"" she added.
    

        Last year, the Inner Circle Experience, a company that organizes exclusive networking events, worked with Dior to host a private dinner for luxury stakeholders at the French label's Paris museum. Springer, who was a keynote speaker at the event, said there were about 70 guests, comprising high-net-worth individuals and ""people like me who hold global marketing positions.""
    

        Attendees learned about the brand's history and how it wants to connect with consumers. ""Somebody like me can tell this to their clients,"" Springer said, which could prompt collaborations with Dior or ""inform PR messaging"" about the label. Additionally, high-net-worth people feel more inclined to spend big bucks on a brand that has marketed to them in such a personal and exclusive way.
    

        Reed said ""there's huge potential"" in the secondhand luxury market, which Statista estimated could be worth over $3.6 billion by 2028. From a marketing perspective, she added, brands can craft resale initiatives around different target audiences. For example, a campaign highlighting circular fashion can resonate with Gen Z shoppers who care about sustainability.
    

        Resale shopping also highlights the quality and desirability of vintage pieces. ""Lots of people have been turning to archives to find old stock that isn't in circulation anymore,"" Reed said. ""There's this excitement and treasure-hunting element to it.""
    

        Joining the secondhand luxury space — and playing a bigger role in the authentication process — can also help high-end labels regain control of their products' integrity and marketability.
    

        ""You see a lot of dupes and counterfeits. That's a huge issue for brands,"" she said. ""A few players have caught on to the fact that they need to preserve their brand.""
    

        Omnichannel marketing is crucial right now as brands need to reach global consumers through multiple touchpoints, Springer said.
    

        Luxury labels need to have a digital presence on platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat to connect with a younger demographic. ""But at the same time, brands can't afford to leave out their older demographic that might still be looking at traditional marketing, like print PR or TV ads,"" Springer added.
    

        She named Sephora's omnichannel marketing as a prime example. The company has in-store beauty consultants and digital smart mirrors, virtual try-on tools on its app and website, and traditional advertising in print and on TV.
    

        ""They understand if you do something like a billboard, you now need to have a QR code so that somebody can snap it on their phone, go to your website, try on a product virtually, and then go into the store on the weekend to buy it,"" Springer said.
    

        Luxury labels need nimble marketing strategies during an economic slowdown, but they must maintain their brands' mission and core values.
    

        Teyibo said concerns about the state of luxury are valid, but she's not particularly worried about it at her agency. ""It doesn't matter what's happening or what the global climate is. Cultural currency and cultural capital are always more important,"" she said. ""Brands and partners will find the budget for what they think is cool. Also, whatever the consumer feels is relevant and exciting, they will find the money to purchase or partake in.""
    

        Springer said the brands that are winning right now are cocreating with micro and macro influencers as well as celebrities.
    

        Louis Vuitton has embraced this approach over the years, collaborating with the Japanese artist Takashi Murakami and tapping Pharrell Williams as its menswear creative director. Willy Chavarria and Kendrick Lamar have also developed a rapport, recently dropping a limited-edition Super Bowl collection. Then, of course, there's the forthcoming launch of NikeSkims.
    

        This emphasis on collaboration reflects a broader shift in the luxury industry — one that calls for a deeper commitment to exciting and inventive artistry.
    

        ""Brands really need to look at design with more intention,"" Reed said. ""Lean into craftsmanship and individuality. Focus on innovation and pushing your creative direction. That is where the luxury sector needs to regain its personality.""

23,2025-03-05,"AMD's extended RDNA 4 delay is in the past, and reviews are now live for the RX 9070 XT and RX 9070. NVIDIA finally has some major competition in the mid-range market.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

AMD's RDNA 4 graphics cards, including the Radeon RX 9070 XT and RX 9070, launch on March 6, but the review embargo lifted today.
It's the first look at real-world performance following AMD's official RDNA 4 presentation in which Team Red showed off some intriguing performance numbers that put the RX 9070 XT roughly in line with the RTX 5070 Ti at 4K Ultra settings.
AMD's claims are one thing, but how do the flagship RX 9070 XT and more affordable RX 9070 actually fare now that they're in a select few gaming PCs?
I pulled quotes from some of the top reviews around the web in order to give you a better idea of what to expect from the new RDNA 4 hardware.
Let's start with the RX 9070 XT before getting into RX 9070 impressions (with some overlap).
Ahead of AMD's March 1 GPU reveal, I wrote about a few ways that Team Red could screw up the RDNA 4 launch.
Thankfully, most of those concerns were put to rest with the performance numbers shared by AMD, and the roster of third-party RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 reviews that went live today confirms my plans to put an RX 9070 XT into my gaming PC.
All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.
The RX 9070 XT isn't perfect. I'm still concerned that the RX 9070's $549 MSRP and RX 9070 XT's $599 MSRP won't actually be available on launch day.
Sure, there are plenty of cards that deserve a higher price due to exclusive hardware improvements, but there also deserves to be a solid amount of RDNA 4 GPUs available at MSRP.
The last thing I want to see is AMD's pricing inflate like we've seen from NVIDIA over the past few weeks.
With the RX 9070 XT coming close to the RTX 5070 Ti and even the RX 7900 XTX in plenty of benchmarks, I care less about efficiency, which remains in favor of NVIDIA.
AMD, by all means, seems to have made some massive improvements to ray tracing and FSR 4, which were two lacking points in previous generations.
AMD claims it has plenty of stock to sell on March 6, but the demand following all of the positive reviews will no doubt put a big dent in availability.
I'm keeping an eye on the best places to shop for the RX 9000 GPUs on launch day, and I urge you to check out the guide for a bit of help. Good luck!

﻿The one-month pause is in effect, but most experts agree that tariffs on Canada and Mexico will send car prices skyrocketing. Some models could disappear altogether.
by  Andrew J. Hawkins
Car prices are already at record highs, and President Donald Trump’s tariffs — if they stay in place — could send them into the stratosphere. The situation remains extremely fluid, with Trump administration officials today announcing a one-month reprieve for the auto industry, according to Politico. 
But if tariffs stay in place, sticker prices could skyrocket by as much as $12,000, according to one analysis. Dealerships could be stuck with a bunch of trucks and SUVs that no one can afford. Some models could vanish from showrooms altogether. Many of these changes won’t take effect right away, as dealerships work through their vehicle stock. But the net impact could still be devastating. 
After an initial delay, Trump earlier this week imposed 25 percent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico as well as an additional 10 percent tariff on goods from China. Around 5.3 million vehicles are built in Canada and Mexico, 70 percent of which are destined for the United States. 
Automakers have warned about catastrophic effects on the industry if Trump’s tariffs remain in place. Ford CEO Jim Farley put the matter plainly at an investor conference last month: “Let’s be real honest,” Farley said, “Long term, a 25 percent tariff across the Mexico and Canadian border will blow a hole in the US industry that we have never seen.”
“Long term, a 25 percent tariff across the Mexico and Canadian border will blow a hole in the US industry that we have never seen.”
That could include a historic decrease in vehicle production in the US, Canada, and Mexico — possibly as much as a third of the vehicle output in all three countries. Current production for North America is about 63,900 vehicles a day: 41,700 in the US; 17,600 in Mexico; and 4,600 in Canada. Production on some models, like the popular Toyota RAV4, which is made in Canada, could halt altogether, S&P Global Mobility said during a webinar this week. It’s unlikely that Toyota will find space at its US assembly plants to replace that production. 
Vehicle prices are already hitting historic highs, with average transactions for new vehicles clocking in at $48,118 in January, according to Edmunds. 
The threat of tariffs didn’t really move the needle last month, but it still has the potential to impact the cost of new vehicles now that they’re in effect. With these tariffs — plus the 25 percent tariff proposed on the EU and a cumulative 20 percent increase on Chinese-made vehicles — the average list price of new vehicles in the US could increase by over 7 percent, from $49,800 to $52,500, according to CarGurus. 
Top-selling models, including the Toyota Tacoma, Chevrolet Equinox, Toyota RAV4, Chevrolet Silverado 1500, and Honda HR-V, could all see major price increases. But the effects won’t be felt for at least several months thanks to healthy inventory levels, up 12 percent year over year. 
The average list price of new vehicles in the US could increase by over 7 percent, from $49,800 to $52,500
Other analysts sifted through component costs for specific US-made vehicle models to see how tariffs could even impact domestically assembled vehicles. Anderson Economic Group concluded that the tariffs could boost manufacturing costs by $4,000 to more than $10,000 per car, depending on the vehicle model. Battery-electric crossover SUVs could see the biggest spike of $12,000, according to the group’s deep dive.
Automakers have had months to prepare for the tariffs, but given the complex nature of supply chains, it’s unclear that any of them will be able to avoid passing cost increases along to consumers. The investment bank Jefferies predicted prices would go up by about 6 percent on average, or $2,700, while two analyses cited by Kelley Blue Book agreed on a $3,000 average price bump.
Auto dealers, many of them Trump supporters, are left to reckon with the repercussions of the president’s trade war. In a recent interview with Fox, a Philadelphia-based Ram dealer called the tariffs “traumatic.” He recounted the experience of a customer who ordered a $80,000 truck, only to abandon the purchase after the price went up by $20,000. 
“It’s going to sit on my lot, and you know the higher interest rates we’re paying right now for floorplan, and nobody’s gonna buy the truck because it just had a $20,000 price increase,” Ram dealer David Kelleher told the outlet.

25,2025-03-05,"Campbell is an editor at large at TIME, based in the Singapore bureau.
Chinese President Xi Jinping reads during a speech by Premier Li Qiang at the opening session of the National Peoples Congress, or NPC, at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on March 5, 2025.
Campbell is an editor at large at TIME, based in the Singapore bureau.
On Jan. 1, Quishi, the official ideological journal of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), published a speech by President Xi Jinping. In it, China’s strongest leader since Mao Zedong called for a period of protracted “struggle” to maintain political security, achieve self-reliance, and demonstrate the superiority of “Chinese-style” modernization over that touted in the West.
“History has repeatedly proven that striving for security through struggle brings genuine security,” Xi said, “while seeking security through weakness and concession ultimately leads to insecurity.”

It sounded like a rallying cry in response to recent challenges, including record youth unemployment, deflationary pressures, stock market crash, burst housing bubble, and spiraling debt—not to mention the return to the White House of Donald Trump, who has made good on his election promise of the world’s top economy hiking tariffs on the world’s top exporting nation.
However, Xi’s speech had actually been delivered at a CCP study session way back in February 2023. By finally publishing it in the party’s flagship journal, the inference is that none of the intervening turmoil has made China’s leadership alter course one iota.
“The last 23 months have been terrible for China’s economy, terrible for households,” Jacob Gunter, a lead economy analyst at the Berlin-based Mercator Institute for China Studies, told a media briefing in late February. The fact that this speech was just published, adds Gunter, “says a lot that this is the path, and we should not expect deviation from it.”
Which is another way of saying don’t expect any big splashes as China’s National People’s Congress (NPC)—its annual rubberstamp parliament—kicks off on Wednesday. In opening the week-long meeting, Chinese Premier Li Qiang issued his annual Work Report, or fiscal health check, which repeated 2024’s growth target of “around 5%” for the coming year and revealed military spending will rise by 7.2%, which is also roughly the same.
“Achieving this year’s targets will not be easy, and we must make arduous efforts to meet them,” Li cautioned an audience of 3,000 cadres crammed into Beijing’s cavernous Great Hall of the People.
Of course, that nothing much will change was largely self-evident by the fact that this NPC follows on the heels of last July’s third CCP plenum, where long-term goals were laid out: bolstering party-state capitalism, countering U.S. containment, boosting innovation, and entrenching loyalty to Xi. As the NPC is a state organ and thus downstream from the apex CCP, drastic course corrections ultimately fall outside its remit.
Still, the NPC’s intransigence does underscore Beijing’s ability to disregard short-term tribulations in favor of long-term goals. Even if, adds Gunter, “continuity considering the economic downturn and the internal and external struggles that China is dealing with is actually quite remarkable.”
But while policy bombshells are unlikely to drop at the NPC, the flurry of speeches and reports will flesh out what we already know: Boosting consumption and expanding domestic demand are top of Beijing’s policy agenda, as well as stabilising the beleaguered property market, attracting foreign investment, and promoting supply chain self-sufficiency.
As for U.S. tariffs, China today enjoys the benefit of experience from Trump’s first term and is taking a more sanguine approach. On Tuesday, Trump added an additional 10% tariff on all Chinese imports on top of the initial 10% he imposed Feb. 4. In response, Beijing announced 15% tariffs on imports of American chicken, wheat, corn and cotton, as well as 10% on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, aquatic products, fruits, vegetables, and dairy products.

“The response from Beijing so far has been to go tit-for-tat but not really make a big issue out of it, probably with the expectation that getting into a big spat would exacerbate matters,” says Chong Ja Ian, an expert on Chinese politics and professor at the National University of Singapore.
How long that composure can continue is a big question. In Trump’s speech before a joint session of Congress that began just minutes after Li’s Work Report, the U.S. President doubled down on threats he would impose reciprocal tariffs on every nation from April 2. “We’ve been ripped off for decades by nearly every country on earth, and that will not be allowed any longer,” he said.
As such, Xi’s longstanding commitment to self-reliance is looking increasingly prescient. On Feb. 17, he welcomed some of the biggest names in China’s technology sector for a highly choreographed meeting, where he urged them to “show their talent” and contribute to China’s growth. It marked an about-turn from Beijing’s heavy-handed regulatory crackdown four years ago and reflects the CCP leadership’s concern about a slowdown in growth amid American efforts to stymie China’s access to transformative technology.
The meeting showed “a recognition that the economy was not doing well,” says Steve Tsang, a professor at the University of London and director of its SOAS China Institute, “and some high-profile gesture needs to be taken to show Xi is serious about getting the economy back on track.”
Indeed, efforts to achieve self-sufficiency—previously enshrined in controversial policies like Made in China 2025—appear to be paying dividends given recent headline-grabbing tech breakthroughs, such as drastically improved yield for Huawei’s latest semiconductor chips and the buzz around China’s generative AI platform DeepSeek, both of which contributed to a stock rally that added rally $4 trillion to markets in China and Hong Kong.
However, sustaining this bull market and improving China’s economic prospects more broadly ultimately depend on boosting domestic consumption, which continues to lag. The issue, writes economist Michael Pettis, a nonresident senior fellow at Carnegie China, is whether weak spending is down simply to consumer confidence or engrained structural problems. “While low confidence is certainly among the causes of China’s economic malaise, much, if not most, of the causality may be structural,” he writes.
Li’s Work Report talked a good game on attracting foreign investment, boosting food security, unleashing the creativity of “future industries,” and plowing $100 billion into new infrastructure projects. Additionally, China will issue 1.3 trillion rmb ($180 billion) in ultra-long special treasury bonds, as well as 4.4 trillion yuan ($600 billion) in local government special-purpose bonds to offset the negative effects of falling tax revenues and depressed land sales.
But analysts doubt these measures directly nor adequately address the underlying reasons for lackluster consumption: public anxiety about future earnings amid a torpid economy and the falling values of real estate, which forms the principal store of household wealth.
“While they did deliver some increase in fiscal support, the degree of easing is more modest than it might appear,” writes Julian Evans-Pritchard, Head of China economics at Capital Economics, in a briefing note. “We remain skeptical that it will be sufficient to prevent growth from slowing this year.”
As such, Xi’s embrace of “struggle” without adequate examination of hardship’s cause may portend more pain ahead.

Forget the incremental annual phone upgrades—it's the weird gadgets and wacky concepts that really make Mobile World Congress fun. Thankfully, MWC 2025 did not disappoint. After checking out all the biggest announcements this year, we got to pacing the halls of the Fira Gran Via in Barcelona to dig out the show's coolest, quirkiest, and downright strangest stuff. Here's what we found.

Aside from its main announcements, Xiaomi granted us a sneak peek at a new modular concept camera phone. Dubbed the Xiaomi Modular Optical System, this setup combines a modified Xiaomi 15 with a detachable Xiaomi 35mm f/1.4 lens, which packs a 100-megapixel Light Fusion X Type 4/3 sensor—a far bigger and more powerful lens than you’ll find in any phone today. There's even a physical focus ring.
The module attaches magnetically to the back of the phone, seamlessly draws power, and sends data at speeds of up to 10 Gbps. It’s a plug-and-play design that works in the regular camera app, just like the built-in camera (you can switch between them by simply tapping an icon), and saves photos to the gallery app just the same too.
While it’s only a concept right now, it’s a polished prototype that could pave the way for multiple add-on lenses and possibly even other accessories, like chargers, power banks, and game controllers, or connections to other Xiaomi devices from the smart home to its EV. There’s no word on any official release plan or price, but the option to switch from a huge camera bump to a detachable lens and get cutting-edge photography is an enticing prospect. —Simon Hill
At first glance, Realme’s camera phone concept is similar to Xiaomi’s above, but there are some crucial differences. This concept features a large camera module and a series of different lens attachments can then be slotted into place on top of it to create something that truly rivals a DSLR. The proprietary attachment on this Realme phone enables you to attach a full-frame mirrorless lens, so you could potentially attach actual DSLR lenses you already have, rather than buying all-new gear. But it is just a concept, so there’s no price or release date and it may never become a buyable phone. —Simon Hill
Sitting cooped up in an office or home isn't good for your health—you need sunlight! But what if you could bring the sunlight indoors? That's the goal for SunLED Life Science with its SunBooster, a tiny webcam-like USB gadget that clamps onto your laptop or computer and blasts near-infrared light at your face.
Whoa, isn't that dangerous? you might ask. Actually, a 2022 study found that daily exposure of near-infrared light at a certain dose had consistent positive benefits on well-being and health, improving mood, reducing drowsiness, and resting heart rate—though only in winter when there isn't much sun exposure.
The SunBooster is capitalizing on that and has three 850 nanometer near-infrared LEDs, with narrow-beam optics to direct the light to your skin and auto-activation so that it won't keep shooting out light after you leave the desk. You won't need to use it all day as it supposedly delivers a “scientifically calibrated dose” within just two to three hours. The Amsterdam-based company says it will add Bluetooth in the future for more functionality. While you'll be able to buy the hardware later this year, the SunLED wants to work with other manufacturers to integrate the underlying technology into everyday products, like laptop screens and monitors for a more seamless design. —Julian Chokkattu
This absolute unit of a smartphone has a whopping 33,000 mAh battery inside it, making it decidedly brick-sized and heavy. But the battery isn’t just about running the phone for days because it has a 100-lumen projector built into the top. It can also serve as a camplight and is built to withstand punishment with drop protection and an IP68/IP69 rating. There’s also a night vision camera and support for reverse wireless charging. It even works as a phone, albeit an enormous fugly one. All this can be yours for just $899. Oukitel also showed us another rugged phone with a pop-out Bluetooth headset built into the camera module. —Simon Hill
Phone brand Infinix showed off a case for its phone made with what it calls “SolarEnergy-Reserving Technology.” This allows the case to capture light and uses it to charge the phone wirelessly—sort of like the Powerfoyle technology in some Urbanista products. The company showed off demos of it working by flashing a bright light at the back of the phone, which in turn began charging. It couldn't charge simply with the ambient light in the room though, as it was too weak.
Infinix says the case stores up to 2 watts of this energy and transfers it to the phone when needed. The company also claims the case employs its “Sunflower” wireless charging technology, inspired by plants that orient themselves toward light. This enables the system in the case to “dynamically adjust the transmission path” to make sure it's getting the most light possible within a 3-meter (roughly 10-foot) range. None of this is designed to keep your phone charged while you're using it, but Infinix thinks it can help increase standby time when you're off doing something else. —Julian Chokkattu
The best folding phones are all about giving you more screen real estate, but can you have too much of a good thing? Huawei’s Mate XT is like the Honor Magic V3 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) but with an extra screen and fold. In truth, tri-fold is a misnomer since there are only two folds, but the three screens form a clever design that unfurls to a full 10.2 inches. It can also be used as a double screen at 7.9 inches, or a single screen in a traditional candy bar phone shape at 6.4 inches.
Fully unfolded, the Mate XT is just 3.6 mm thick, but you have two creases to contend with. Fold it up completely, and it’s 12.8 mm thick, and also kinda heavy. The hinges are slick, and it feels surprisingly durable, with a satisfying folding action. It has an IPX8 rating for dust resistance.
The Huawei Mate XT Ultimate relies upon Huawei’s own Kirin chipset and Harmony OS. The rest of the specs are solid and close to flagship, with a triple lens camera (50-megapixel main, 12-megapixel ultrawide, and 12-megapixel periscope telephoto), fairly large 5,600 mAh battery, 16 GB of RAM, and 1 TB of storage. But then you’d expect them to be considering the €3,500 price tag. If double the folds equaled double the screen size, it would be more tempting, but it doesn't feel far away from a book-style foldable and you're paying a premium for the novelty right now. It's only available in specific markets, like the Middle East, at the moment, but it should be landing in Europe soon. —Simon Hill
Cameras on our faces seem to be an inevitable future. So why wear an action camera on your body when you can have it baked into your cycling glasses? That's the pitch of BleeqUp Ranger. Right in the center of the glasses—UV400 and IP54-rated, by the way—is a camera that can record up to one hour of 1080p video. There's a little battery accessory that clips to the back of a helmet, doubling as a tail light, and it boosts that video recording time to five hours in total. The arms of the glasses have speakers so you can play music, and they sounded pretty good in my brief demo in a very loud space. Naturally, there's AI at play here but not on the glasses themselves. The algorithms analyze the footage and suggest the most interesting clips, putting them together into a highlight reel with minimal effort on your part. The glasses are launching on Kickstarter later this month for $499. —Julian Chokkattu
I engaged in some guided Japanese calligraphy with the help of NTT Docomo’s AR glasses at MWC. They are big and chunky, but these glasses don’t have to be plugged directly into anything, and you can fix your content in space so it doesn’t move with your head. It was relatively easy for me to reproduce the symbol before me, despite my lack of artistic talent, and they could be used in the workplace to overlay engine parts or guide device repairs. While these glasses cost around $1,500 and are aimed primarily at businesses, NTT also showed me a new, lighter pair it has in the works, with a simplified display for navigation and notifications from a Bluetooth-connected phone. The next-gen MiRZA AR Glasses are aimed at Joe Public and will be closer to $500, but may require an AI subscription. —Simon Hill
I wrote about Xpanceo at last year's Mobile World Congress, and the company is back with more smart contact lens prototypes. One of these is a contact lens that could be recharged through a contact lens case, and another had biosensors that could analyze certain parameters in tear fluid to monitor glucose, cortisol, and more. Another prototype had a pattern on the lens that shifts in response to intraocular pressure, which can help detect glaucoma early, and there also was a Smart Contact Lens for AR Vision, which had an integrated microdisplay to show images. I was able to look through this one and read some text! The ultimate goal is to bake all of these prototypes into one product—the stuff of sci-fi dreams—but this kind of miniature technology is incredibly difficult to engineer. It will be a long while before a smart contact lens arrives on the market. —Julian Chokkattu
Closing in on 30,000 steps for the day, my burning tootsies may have had something to do with Solecooler catching my eye amid a sea of strange inventions and startups. The kindly inventor, Bruno Aubert (a thermodynamics engineer) explained that these clever insoles heat your feet by up to 4 degrees Celsius, or, if you flip them, cool by 3.5 degrees. The beauty is that they are charged up by you walking on them, though they take a few minutes to get going (much like air conditioning). They cost €50 and come in one size, which you must cut down if you’re below size 14.
Aubert is now working on new battery-free, pressure-adjusting insoles called Warnfeet, with multiple sensors to monitor your feet and protect them, potentially preventing blisters for athletes and guarding against ulcers for diabetics. —Simon Hill
No, this is not the second coming of the Humane Ai Pin (although that could already be in progress). This is Keocam, a personal safety “dashcam” from Keotech, which, much like the infamous AI wearable, stays affixed to clothes thanks to a separate magnetic back.
It connects to your smartphone and continuously records a one-minute loop, storing each clip on the device, your phone, and a backup in the cloud, ensuring there are multiple copies. In the event of an emergency, press the button and it will save and upload the previous minute and will start recording until you press the button again to stop it. In the companion app, you'll be able to add contacts so that emergency footage can be sent to them. It has a 3-hour battery life, a 160-degree angle camera, and an IP67 rating for protection from the elements. It will be available later this year. —Julian Chokkattu
Accurate, low-power gesture recognition could be a crucial piece of the puzzle for wearables like smart glasses, and Neuranics has developed a solution that relies on Tunneling Magnetoresistance (TMR). The Scottish startup has designed its own sensors and integrated circuits and showed WIRED a demo where hand movements were tracked on screen via a small sensor worn on the arm. These incredibly sensitive sensors can detect the smallest muscle movements and also have applications for healthcare and fitness. The hope is that the tech might be licensed and folded into something like the Apple Watch. —Simon Hill
We've covered Doublepoint's WowMouse smartwatch app before—it lets you use gestures while wearing your WearOS watch or Apple Watch to replicate mouse-like functionality on a PC. New at MWC, the company unveiled even more gestures you can use, like a flick to scroll a page, and these gestures are going to fall under WowMouse Pro—an upgrade tier that costs $5 (only available for Android right now).
It's not just new gestures—you can assign custom actions to double tap and adjust music playback with hand movements too. The company says it has crossed 140,000 downloads since CES 2024 and its tech is now being integrated into the chips themselves, meaning less power consumption and lower latency. —Julian Chokkattu
Whispp is a subscription app that allows users to whisper into their phone and have the app convert those whispers to regular speech. Originally designed by the Dutch inventor Joris Castermans to overcome his severe stutter, the technology also works wonderfully for folks with damaged vocal cords. We tried it out at MWC and found you could select a voice and then whisper into your phone’s microphone and have the audio come out, almost in real-time, from a connected Bluetooth speaker. You can even train the AI to use your voice if you can provide a sample.
Castermans is already at work on an improved version capable of on-device processing; the current app sends the audio to the cloud for processing, which accounts for the small delay and the subscription fee. The hope is that the new technology might be licensed and rolled into a popular chipset as an additional assistive technology, though it also has other applications, such as giving voice to folks working on noisy factory floors. Castermans also hopes to find a way to help folks who struggle to enunciate and fully form words. The Whispp app is available now for Android or iOS and costs £20 or €20 a month. —Simon Hill
Rugged phones with Flir-powered thermal cameras are nothing new, but Sonim's latest XP Pro Thermal doesn't really look like a rugged phone. It's fairly thin for its category, even with its 5,000-mAh battery and a thicker-than-usual layer of Corning's Gorilla Glass Victus II for increased durability for the 6.58-inch LCD screen. It's powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 chip with 8 GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage. This phone comes with the My Flir Pro app built into Sonim's Iris app, and what's neat is the company plans to expand the features to make the thermal function more versatile. You'll be able to program the phone to, say, capture a thermal image at certain intervals. That could be handy if you want to analyze an area over some time. The XP Pro Thermal is launching in Europe and South Africa in the second quarter, and it will make its way to the US. —Julian Chokkattu
With four RGB LEDs on each disc, the Catch Pad caught my attention because it resembles that old electronic Simon game from Hasbro where you need to press the colors in the right sequence. Turns out these discs are sensor-packed and offer a modular system for all sorts of sports training. They can light up, vibrate, make sounds, and measure everything, from pressure to relative force, not to mention register touch, vibration, proximity, and balance. Each disc has a rechargeable battery inside and connects to the Android or iOS app on your phone via Bluetooth.
The software is highly customizable and capable of tracking all sorts of data. There are more than 100 different training programs you can use as a base, from hand-eye coordination, speed, and force measurements for boxing practice to soccer dribbling skills and tight ball control. Prices start from around €280 on the CatchPad website. —Simon Hill
I've been covering Metalenz for a few years—the company makes advanced optics called metasurfaces that eliminate the need for multiple lens elements in a smartphone camera, thereby making them more compact. In 2024, the company announced Polar ID—the ability to utilize polarization data captured through this metasurface lens to identify and authenticate people. This is the Android world's answer to Apple's Face ID—or so the company hopes—and it's far cheaper to produce. Metalenz didn't have any announcements at MWC 2025, but the company did show me the new face masks it's using to test the accuracy of its authentication system. Well, it's not really a 3D mask anymore—it's a full-blown head. (You can see the Polar ID module below the head in the photo above.) Indeed, Polar ID rejected the creepily lifelike head during an authentication attempt; the polarization data—how light bounces off of subjects—was different from that of the real person. The company says we can expect Polar ID in Android devices in 2026. —Julian Chokkattu

29,2025-03-05,"Food prices in Gaza have risen sharply and aid food parcels could soon run out after Israel blocked the entry of humanitarian aid, the UN's humanitarian agency said.
OCHA's partners reported that flour and vegetable prices had more than doubled in some cases, with Gazans telling the BBC the same.
If the blockade continued, ""at least 80 community kitchens may soon run out of stock"" and remaining food parcels that ""will support 500,000 people, will soon run out"", OCHA said.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu chose to stop aid at the weekend, accusing Hamas of stealing supplies and refusing a US proposal to extend the Gaza ceasefire. A Hamas spokesman said the halt was ""cheap blackmail"".
The foreign ministers of France, Germany and the UK issued a joint statement on Wednesday calling the humanitarian situation in Gaza ""catastrophic"" and expressing deep concern at Israel's action.
""A halt on goods and supplies entering Gaza, such as that announced by the government of Israel would risk violating international humanitarian law,"" the statement read. ""Humanitarian aid should never be contingent on a ceasefire or used as a political tool.""
The ministers said it was vital that the ceasefire was sustained, all hostages held by Hamas were released, and continued flows of aid were ensured.
Thousands of aid trucks had surged into Gaza each week under the ceasefire deal that started on 19 January. 
After the ceasefire's first phase expired on Saturday night, Netanyahu's office accused Hamas of stealing aid ""to finance its terror machine"".
Hamas has previously denied stealing humanitarian aid in Gaza.
Netanyahu also said Hamas was refusing to accept a six-week ceasefire extension, under different terms from those previously agreed, as proposed by US President Donald Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff.
After the halt of aid in response, OCHA said on Tuesday that some community kitchens which remain operational ""will need to start to adjust meal content or reduce the number of meals prepared to cope with anticipated shortages"".
Partners would also ""be forced to reduce food rations"". While they are distributing previously dispatched food parcels, remaining supplies are expected to run out.
Abu Qais Aryan, from Khan Younis, told BBC Arabic the cost of basic goods doubled over Sunday night. Prices had already doubled or tripled since the war began, he said.
Other residents said the price of a 1kg (2.2lb) of tomatoes rose overnight from five shekels ($1.38; £1.07) to 10, and a 1kg of cucumbers from six to 17 shekels.
""We could barely afford to buy a kilo of tomatoes just to satisfy our hunger,"" said one man, Issam, adding that people could not buy food ""because there is no cash liquidity"".
Issa Meit, from Gaza City, said there was a shortage of goods and very high consumption, and he was ""very afraid that prices will increase again"".
""The recent decision is unfair as it wrongs our children. How will our children live in light of these high prices that will increase in an arbitrary way?"" he said.
Some blamed merchants for hiking prices, saying they were exploiting the situation.
Merchant Mahmoud Abu Mohsen told BBC Arabic he raised prices because the wholesalers he purchases from did as well.
""For example, I used to buy sugar for five shekels, three shekels, or four shekels, but now I buy sugar for six shekels, meaning I don't make more than a small profit,"" he said. ""The news that Netanyahu announced is what caused a stir among the people.""
A spokeswoman for Doctors Without Borders (MSF), Caroline Seguin, told the BBC on Wednesday that in Gaza City, the price of just over 2lb (900g) of sugar had risen from just over $1 (78p) to $5. 
In Khan Younis and Gaza City, the cost of a carton of 30 eggs had shot up around 150%, she added.
""The news has created uncertainty and fear, causing food prices to spike,"" Ms Seguin said in an earlier statement. ""Israel is once again blocking an entire population from receiving aid, using it as a bargaining chip. This is unacceptable, outrageous, and will have devastating consequences.""
Qatar and Egypt, which helped mediate the ceasefire along with the US, condemned Israel's move.
Qatar's foreign ministry called the decision ""a clear violation of the ceasefire agreement"" and ""international humanitarian law"" in a statement. 
Egypt's foreign ministry accused Israel of using starvation as ""a weapon against the Palestinian people"".
Israeli government spokesman David Mencer said in a video briefing that ""Hamas has hoarded for months and months of supplies. They have enough food to fuel an obesity epidemic.""
""The supplies are there but Hamas doesn't share,"" he added.
A month ago, OCHA said more than a million people - roughly half of Gaza's population - had received food assistance since the ceasefire began.
All aid, not just food, is affected by the blockade. 
Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP) said that inside Gaza, it had some medicine in reserve for its clinics and assistive devices for people with disabilities, in addition to hygiene kits.
""However, we don't currently have high aid reserves as most items entering were for immediate distribution,"" the charity said.
Ms Seguin said even though it appeared MSF's medical supplies would last for a few months, ""it doesn't mean that we haven't been consistently running short of essentials"".
The main concern for the health system, she said, was fuel for generators at hospitals to ensure ventilators and other critical medical equipment continued to work.
She said ""the consequences will be at the cost of the people in Gaza"".
The ceasefire aimed to end 15 months of conflict, which erupted after Hamas killed about 1,200 people and took another 251 hostage in its attack on Israel on 7 October 2023.
Israel responded with an air and ground campaign in Gaza that killed at least 48,405 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
A ballistic missile was fired toward Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv, with sirens sounding in several areas of Israel.
Israel says troops have moved in up to the Netzarim Corridor, after two days of air strikes killed hundreds in Gaza.
Israel's military denies attacking the Deir al-Balah compound, after the Hamas-run health ministry blamed an Israeli strike.
Israel's PM warns ""this is only the beginning"" after deadly strikes on Gaza that broke a ceasefire with Hamas.
The truce was already in trouble - now Israeli air strikes have dealt it a huge blow.

Trump's tariffs are now a reality, and that is bad news for the Detroit automakers.

        The 25% levies on all goods imported from Canada and Mexico, which went into effect yesterday, could have a devastating impact on the Detroit ""Big Three"" of Ford, GM, and Stellantis, analysts at Barclays have warned.
    

        ""In short, without any adjustment from automakers (i.e. no price increase, no adjustment in production plans), we estimate it could wipe out effectively all profits for the Detroit Three,"" Barclays analysts Dan Levy and Josh Cho wrote in a note on Tuesday.
    

        The US auto industry is heavily entangled with its neighbors to the north and south, with car components often crossing the border multiple times during production.
    

        As such, the tariffs enacted by President Donald Trump — which are now finally live after being paused for a month in February — will impact all automakers.
    

        The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents nearly every major US automaker, warned on Tuesday that the import taxes could see car prices rise by as much as 25%, while data forecaster S&P Global estimated that a third of vehicle production in North America could be cut by next week.
    

        Shares in Ford, GM, and Stellantis all fell on Tuesday amid broader market turmoil on the tariff news.
    

        Barclays analysts said that while no automaker will emerge unscathed from the tariffs, Ford, GM, and Stellantis — which includes brands such as Jeep and Chrysler — were the most exposed.
    

        All three have factories in Mexico, which has become a hub for automakers thanks to its low labor costs, and produce key models for the US market in the country.
    

        The analysts estimated the tariffs would add around $3,000 to the cost of a vehicle with half its parts produced in Mexico or Canada. They warned that moving production to the US would be difficult due to high labor costs and long lead times on capacity adjustment.
    

        Ford, GM, and Stellantis did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

Bristol Myers Squibb stock (NYSE: BMY) has risen by 7% this year, outperforming the S&P 500 which has fallen by 1%. BMS’s robust Q4 performance has contributed to its positive momentum. Although new U.S. tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China are putting pressure on markets, investors are shifting toward defensive positions amid economic uncertainty. Our analysis on market crash risk right now provides more insight into how tariffs are affecting the broader markets.
In spite of its recent strength, BMY stock is still down 9% over a longer period beginning in early 2023, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 index, up 50%. This decline is mainly due to:
We examine these factors in the sections below. Although BMY stock has underperformed recently, if you prefer a smoother ride with potential upside compared to a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and delivered >91% returns since inception.
Bristol Myers Squibb’s revenue is challenged by declining sales of legacy drugs such as Revlimid. Nevertheless, the impressive performance of Eliquis, which generated over $13 billion in sales last year, serves as a counterbalance. Although Eliquis sales are expected to grow in the near term, biosimilar competition is looming as its market exclusivity expires in 2028. BMS anticipates that its new cardiovascular drug, Camzyos, will offset the eventual decline in Eliquis sales. Additionally, BMS expects that newer drugs, including Sotyktu and Opdualag, will each exceed $1 billion in sales by 2026. To further drive growth, BMS has pursued strategic acquisitions by acquiring Mirati Therapeutics, RayzeBio, and Karuna Therapeutics. These moves have expanded BMS’s pipeline to over 50 compounds, including the recently FDA-approved schizophrenia drug, Cobenfy, which has a potential peak sales estimate of over $7 billion. As an aside, amid increased economic uncertainty, and investors possibly becoming more defensive, see Kimberly-Clark Stock: Navigating Margin Growth And Market Challenges.
Since 2022, Bristol Myers Squibb has lowered its outstanding shares from 2.15 billion to 2.03 billion through $13 billion in share repurchases. Although the company still has $5 billion authorized for buybacks as of December 31, 2024, no repurchases occurred in 2024.
BMS is currently facing valuation pressure even though its revenues have increased. This is due to several factors, chiefly the declining sales of established blockbuster drugs and the anticipated generic competition for Eliquis. While its new drug portfolio shows promising growth, BMS forecasts a 6% revenue decline for the current year, and we expect this downward trend to continue into 2026. As a result, investors have applied a lower valuation multiple to the stock.
Currently, at around $60 per share, BMS stock is trading at 2.5 times its trailing revenues, which is slightly below its five-year average price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 2.6. According to our analysis, Bristol Myers Squibb’s valuation is estimated to be around $61 per share, closely matching the current market price.
Even though new drug approvals present potential upside, the near-term financial outlook is primarily affected by the revenue impact from declining legacy drug sales. This short-term challenge appears to be overshadowing the long-term growth prospects of the company’s emerging pharmaceutical pipeline.
As BMY stock navigates lower sales and valuation, explore the potential of the High-Quality Portfolio, a curated list of 30 stocks that has consistently delivered superior returns compared to the S&P 500 over the past four years.

37,2025-03-05,"The new MacBook Air has a useful upgrade: it natively supports up to two external displays, in addition to the laptop's built-in display.
In other words, the latest MacBook Air can be used with a pair of external displays without needing to keep the laptop's lid closed.
Apple's tech specs for the new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air:
Simultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display at 1 billion colors and: Up to two external displays with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz
This is a significant quality-of-life improvement for the MacBook Air in the Apple silicon era. MacBook Air models with the M1 chip and M2 chip officially support only one external display, while MacBook Air models with the M3 chip gained support for two external displays, but only with the lid closed. With the new model, users can have a total of three screens, with the MacBook Air open next to two external displays.
Apple silicon MacBook Air models already worked with multiple external displays with the use of DisplayLink adapters, but many casual customers in the MacBook Air's target market might not have known about that option, so official plug-and-play support for two external displays with the lid open is a welcomed improvement.
The latest 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M4 chip, released last year, also natively supports two external displays while the lid is open.
The new MacBook Air can be pre-ordered now, and it launches Wednesday, March 12.

38,2025-03-05,"Shortwave radio has a charm all its own: part history, part mystery, and a whole lot of tech nostalgia. The Hallicrafters S-53A is a prime example of mid-century engineering, but when you get your hands on one, chances are it won’t be in mint condition. Which was exactly the case for this restoration project by [Ken’s Lab], where the biggest challenge wasn’t fried capacitors or burned-out tubes, but a stubborn band selector switch that refused to budge.
What made it come to this point? The answer is: time, oxidation, and old-school metal tolerances. Instead of forcing it (and risking a very bad day), [Ken]’s repair involved careful disassembly, a strategic application of lubricant, and a bit of patience. As the switch started to free up, another pleasant surprise emerged: all the tubes were original Hallicrafters stock. A rare find, and a solid reason to get this radio working without unnecessary modifications. Because some day, owning a shortwave radio could be a good decision.
Once powered up, the receiver sprang to life, picking up shortwave stations loud and clear. Hallicrafters’ legendary durability proved itself once before, in this fix that we covered last year. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the best repairs aren’t about drastic changes, but small, well-placed fixes.
What golden oldie did you manage to fix up?


I have one of those stashed away and I just checked the band switch and it clicks! A similar model with series tubes I have at work was last on every day for the Christian Science Monitor’s 2 hour global news during the gulf war. CSM with 3 sites covered the world, that was one of the best now gone. At that time Purdue lost NPR. Unless I did FM DX, AM-SW that was all there was. Some powerful religious SW broadcasters are in Indiana, so there’s little else now.
A firmly locked Vice-Grip is the best way to carefully move something that’s stuck. Move barely at first watching for motion that’s not stripping or breaking. Wiggling and solvent usually gets it when you can’t torch it hot.
WWV is always good for a time sync because broadcast radio is full of time delayed web feeds with digital STL’s but will it survive all the slashing?
There is plenty to listen to on broadcast shortwave today.  I listen 8-12 hours a day with English broadcasts from outside of the US.  There hasn’t been any religious shortwave out of Indiana for years. Maybe you should turn a radio on….
There are still plenty of affordable S-53A’s on Ebay if you are up for a restoration project. Here are the manuals free to download from the Boat Anchor Manual Archive (BAMA):
https://bama.edebris.com/manuals/hallicra/s53a/
The wiring was such a mess back then.
Not that I don’t like “3D wiring” per se or don’t realize that it can be effective, but there’s no cable managment, at all.
It’s just a mess, lile in a Junost TV from USSR.
I’m so glad that PCBs and modular designs had superseded this.
The Japanese amateur radios from the 1970s were much cleaner built, for example.
Yaesu FT-101 comes to mind spontaneously.
Oh, and these old radios also seem to lack “chamber technique”.
Industrial or military grade radios would use separate, grounded metal chambers for each oscillator, amplifier etc.
The cables may pass through tiny holes (sometimes insulated with rubber rings) of each chamber.
The cables themselves would been bundled together with strings.
All of that cost money, and no need for any of it.
Doesn’t make the radio work any better.
Not to mention no lifted traces.
I use to laugh at wannabee” techs who hated working on consumer electronics.
They had not trained their soldering irons to stay away from plastic insulation.
/Sue needs to restore that SX-62 sitting on the dresser.
Hm. I’ve seen radios built by amateurs on a kitchen table that had better circuit design than these old commercial made radios.
And yes, these people propably had no money on mind. And I think that’s good.
It wasn’t until the 70’s where PCBs became good enough. Early phenolic PCBs would occasionally have copper traces lift during normal use. Almost certain to happen during rework.
These were more or less consumer grade radios.  Hallicrafters made some very good pre WW-II amateur equipment and they also made some very good military equipment for the War.  Collins was more technical though.  I had the military version of the Collins 51-J3 that I got at the Dayton  in the 1980s.  That was 30 1 MHz bands from 0 to 30 MHz.  The band switching was a mechanical marvel.  I probably shouldn’t have sold it, but a friend really wanted that radio.
Nice looking receiver.
What are people liking these days for restoring old selector switches – Caig DeOxIt D5?

42,2025-03-05,"President Donald Trump addressed Congress and the nation Tuesday evening.
As Washington sought on Wednesday to make sense of President Donald Trump's joint address to Congress, House Republicans saw the speech as going ""overwhelmingly well,"" while Democrats called it ""partisan and divisive.""
Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson and Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries appeared on ABC News' ""Good Morning America"" on Wednesday, presenting their parties' differing views of Trump's Tuesday speech.
""That was one of the most partisan and divisive speeches every delivered by an American president,"" Jeffries told ABC News' George Stephanopoulos.
Trump spoke to thundering applause from Republican majorities in the House and Senate, but faced heckles from some raucous Democrats.
""The speech last night went overwhelmingly well,"" Johnson said on Wednesday on ""GMA."" ""It was not a speech for the mainstream media -- it was a speech for the American people.""
During the speech, Rep. Al Green, an 11-term Democrat representing the Houston area, stood up and pointed his cane at the dais and shouted, ""You have no mandate to cut Medicaid."" He was escorted from the chamber.
Democrats resorted to ""pettiness,"" and their protests during the speech amounted to a ""a sad affair,"" Johnson said on Wednesday. He pointed to Green ""trying to interrupt the whole proceeding.""
""If the Democrats want a 77-year-old congressman to be the face of their resistance, heckling the president, then bring it on,"" Johnson said. ""But we couldn't allow that on the House floor.""
Jeffries responded, saying the ""vast majority"" of Democrats ""showed restraint, listened to what the president had to say."" He said he ""strongly"" disagreed with Johnson's characterization.
""The biggest problem I had with the speech, there was nothing said, nothing laid out, nothing articulated by Donald Trump to meet the needs of the American people, particularly as it relates to the economy,"" he said.
The president heaped praise on Elon Musk, the billionaire tech mogul, and his Department of Government Efficiency, which has been busy slashing the federal government.
Johnson shrugged off concern that Musk appeared to some to be an ""unelected bureaucrat,"" saying he amounted to a ""patriotic American.""
""He's doing a great service for the country and he ought to be applauded,"" he said.
Trump defended the tariffs he put in place on Tuesday on goods from Mexico and China, along with the increased duties in Chinese goods.
""Tariffs are not just about protecting American jobs, they're about protecting the soul of our country. Tariffs are about making America rich again,"" Trump said during the speech.
But Jeffries pointed to kitchen-table issues that, he said, the president hasn't focused enough on.
""Donald Trump promised to lower costs. In fact, he promised to lower costs on day one,"" he said. ""We know that grocery prices are not going down, they are going up, inflation is going up, and the stock market is going down, which is hurting the retirement security of everyday Americans.""
As March 14 approaches and a potential federal government shutdown looms, both Jeffries and Johnson were asked about what the Democrats are doing to keep the federal government funded and open.
""We want to make surety government remains open and that we can agree upon a spending bill that meets the needs of the American people, in terms of their health and safety, our national security, and their economic well-being,"" Jeffries said. ""When congress appropriates the money, the administration -- Democratic or Republican -- it needs to spend that money consistent with improving the lives of American people, that's not unreasonable. That's entirely reasonable.""
Johnson, however, appeared confident that a resolution to keep the government open would pass, in spite of what he called ""unreasonable and unprecedented demands"" by Democrats.
""We will have a resolution, and pass it to the House and send it on the. Senate,"" said Johnson. ""I hope reasonably-minded people will negotiate this in good faith. We are working for a top line everyone can agree with.""

44,2025-03-05,"The major U.S. automakers were given a one-month exemption from new tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports, the Trump administration said Wednesday. 
“We spoke with the Big Three auto dealers. We are going to give a one month exemption on any autos coming through USMCA,” President Donald Trump said, according to a statement provided White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt during a news conference. 
The tariffs that went into effect early on Tuesday include 25% duties on all Mexican goods and most Canadian goods, and 20% on goods imported from China. The duties on Canadian goods include a carveout for energy products, which will be taxed at 10%. 
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has said tariffs will only “increase the economic pain” being felt by Americans, warning that some companies it represents could be forced out of business. Stock markets plunged as a result of Trump’s tariffs, as well as retaliatory measures from other nations.
Most major U.S. industries are set to be impacted by the new tariffs, including farmers and restaurants, as well as retailers like Best Buy (BBY+1.11%) and Target (TGT+0.54%). Automakers were expected to be especially vulnerable to the economic effect of the tariffs because their supply chains are highly dependent on Canada and Mexico.
The Michigan-based Anderson Economic Group estimates that a 25% tariff would add between $4,000 and $10,000 per car to vehicles assembled in North America. Battery-electric vehicles could cost as much as $12,000 more.
The profit margins of General Motors (GM+2.46%), Ford Motor Co. (F+2.61%), and Stellantis (STLA+0.40%) would be wiped out without price hikes, Barclays analysts said in a note earlier this week. Leavitt said those companies reached out to the president and requested the exemption, which the president was “happy to do.” 
“Let’s be real honest: Long term, a 25% tariff across the Mexico and Canada borders would blow a hole in the U.S. industry that we’ve never seen,” Ford Motor Co. CEO Jim Farley said at a recent investor conference.
The temporary reprieve was teased earlier Wednesday by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who said that some industries may receive some relief throughout March. On April 2, Trump plans to issue his reciprocal tariffs, which he says will make trade more fair to the U.S.
“Whatever they tax us, we will tax them,” the president said on Tuesday. “If they do nonmonetary tariffs to keep us out of their market, then we will do nonmonetary barriers to keep them out of our market.”
Lutnick had noted that any relief would likely be targeted at products that are compliant with regulations under the USMCA trade deal that Trump negotiated during his first term. That deal is up for renewal in 2026. 
“My thinking is it’s going to be somewhere in the middle. Not 100% of all products and not none,” Lutnick said. “I think Mexico and Canada are trying their best [to crack down on the smuggling of fentanyl into the U.S.]”
Almost 98% of fentanyl seized by Customs and Border Patrol was intercepted at the U.S.’ southwest border with Mexico, the BBC reported. Less than 1% was found at the northern border with Canada, and the remainder was found at other checkpoints. Canada and China have both questioned the Trump administration’s focus on fentanyl, calling it an excuse to issue his tariffs. 
Trump on Wednesday said on his Truth Social that Canada’s efforts to limit the flow of fentanyl were “not good enough,” claiming in a follow-up post that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s border policies “are responsible for the death of many people.”

Boeing stock (NYSE:BA) fell 7% on Tuesday, March 4th, due to concerns over the impact of new tariffs. The company’s reliance on imported components makes it particularly vulnerable to trade disruptions, which could lead to increased costs and reduced production efficiency.
Recent market volatility has been largely attributed to the Trump administration's tariff policies and their potential ripple effects across the broader economic landscape. The implementation of these trade barriers has raised concerns about inflationary pressures and overall economic stability. Our comprehensive analysis delves into the market crash risk, offering an in-depth examination of how these tariffs might fundamentally reshape economic dynamics and investor sentiment.
At its current levels of around $160, BA looks very unattractive - making it a bad pick to buy at its current price. We believe there are several major concerns with BA stock, which makes it very unattractive given that its current valuation looks moderate.
  We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of BA stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Boeing along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a very weak operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. However, if you seek upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception.
Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, BA stock is currently valued in line with the broader market.
• Boeing has a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 1.5 vs. a figure of 3.1 for the S&P 500
Boeing's Revenues have declined marginally over recent years.
• Boeing has seen its top line grow at an average rate of 3.1% over the last 3 years (vs. 9.8% for S&P 500)
  • Its revenues have decreased 14% from $78 Bil to $67 Bil in the last 12 months (vs. change of 5.6% for S&P 500)
  • Also, its quarterly revenues declined 31% to $15 Bil in the most recent quarter from $22 Bil a year ago (vs. 7.2% change for S&P 500)
Boeing’s profit margins are considerably worse than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Amid increased economic uncertainty, see Kimberly-Clark Stock: Navigating Margin Growth And Market Challenges.
• Boeing’s Operating Income over the last four quarters was $-10.8 Bil, which represents a very poor Operating Margin of -16.3% (vs. 12.6% for S&P 500)
  • Boeing’s Operating Cash Flow (OCF) over this period was $-12.1 Bil, pointing to a very poor OCF-to-Sales Ratio of -18.2% (vs. 14.4% for S&P 500)
Boeing's balance sheet looks weak.
• Boeing’s Debt figure was $54 Bil at the end of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $117 Bil (as of 3/4/2025). This implies a poor Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 46.2% (vs. 19.7% for S&P 500). [Note: A lower Debt-to-Equity Ratio is desirable]
  • Cash (including cash equivalents) makes up $26 Bil of the $156 Bil in Total Assets for Boeing. This yields a moderate Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 7.6% (vs. 14.1% for S&P 500)
BA stock has fared worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. Worried about the impact of a market crash on BA stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes.
• BA stock fell 48.7% from a high of $225.96 on 17 January 2022 to $115.86 on 13 June 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500
  • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 26 July 2023
  • Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $264.27 on 17 December 2023 and currently trades at around $160
• BA stock fell 71.9% from a high of $338.30 on 19 February 2020 to $95.01 on 22 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500
  • The stock is yet to recover to its pre-Crisis high
• BA stock fell 71.1% from a high of $101.45 on 9 October 2007 to $29.36 on 3 March 2009, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500
  • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 7 June 2013
In summary, Boeing's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows:
• Growth: Neutral
  • Profitability: Extremely Weak
  • Financial Stability: Weak
  • Downturn Resilience: Very Weak
  • Overall: Very Weak
This isn’t appropriately reflected in the stock's moderate valuation which is why we think it is very unattractive, which supports our conclusion that BA is a bad stock to buy.
While you would do well to avoid BA stock for now, you could explore the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that?The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid- and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

49,2025-03-05,"Mortgage rates declined last week to their lowest level of 2025, according to a Mortgage Bankers Association survey released Wednesday morning, providing some relief for prospective home buyers beleaguered by years of high rates, though the impetus for cheaper mortgages is not exactly welcome news for consumers.
Trump and his top economic official Scott Bessent have shifted their focus to mortgage rates and ... [+] bond yields as the stock market wobbles.
The average 30-year mortgage rate in the U.S. was 6.73% for loans of $806,500 or less in the week ending last Friday, according to the MBA.
That’s the lowest reading since early December, declining about 30 basis points from the more than 7% mortgage rates that clouded much of January.
The decline came amid “souring consumer sentiment regarding the economy and increasing uncertainty over the impact of new tariffs,” according to Joel Kan, the MBA’s vice president and deputy chief economist.
The mortgage rate move came as yields fell for the highly correlated 10-year U.S. government bonds. Yields for 10-year Treasury notes declined about 70 basis points from their January peak of 4.9% to 4.2% at Friday’s market close. Treasury yields, which equate to the annual interest payments investors require to hold the federal government’s debt, are in turn correlated with market expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. Lower yields are in part due to optimism about the Trump administration improving the U.S.’ fiscal picture, but the latest downward turn has come as investors flooded out of stocks and piled into safer bonds.
As the stock market wobbles as Wall Street wavers on Trump’s tariffs, Trump and his top officials have shifted their attention to the bond market. Over the last two weeks, the S&P 500 benchmark stock index has sunk 6% as yields for the 10-year Treasury dipped from 4.5% to 4.2% (lower yields signal more valuable bonds). Trump emphasized his desire for lower borrowing costs in his Tuesday address to Congress, saying he wants to “bring down mortgage rates” and celebrating the “beautiful drop, big beautiful drop” in “interest rates” Tuesday, though the 10-year yield actually increased slightly in Tuesday trading. “One of the biggest wins for the American people is, since Election Day, and since inauguration, mortgage rates have come down dramatically,” declared Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in a Tuesday interview. The MBA’s final pre-election survey revealed an average 30-year mortgage rate of 6.81%, just eight basis points above where they now stand, and its final pre-inauguration poll found a 7.02% mortgage rate. But mortgage rates are still far pricier than they were in September, when they hit a two-year low of 6.1%.
Mortgage rates peaked at a 23-year high of nearly 8% in late 2023, before pulling back slightly as the Fed pivoted away from further rate increases. Mortgage rates are still nearly twice as expensive as they were five years ago, before the COVID-19 pandemic upended the picture for borrowers, even as average home prices hover near a record high. Significant decreases in mortgage rates often come in times of significant economic distress as the Fed slashes its target rate to stimulate the economy.

50,2025-03-05,"Pixel 9 Pro is the top smartphone, and Gemini earned the ""Breakthrough Device Innovation"" award. 

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Google took home two of Global Mobile's (GLOMO) most prestigious awards at Mobile World Congress 2025 in Barcelona, the company announced today, March 5. Google's Pixel 9 Pro won the major ""Smartphone of the Year"" award, which is the brand's second win in a row for that category. Additionally, Google's work in AI was honored as Gemini won the ""Breakthrough Device Innovation"" award.
Last year's winner for Smartphone of the Year was the Google Pixel 8 series, and that victory was crucial for both the brand and Android phones as a whole. It was the first time an Android handset had secured the pivotal award since 2021. Now, Google has managed to achieve the feat in two straight years, claiming the ""Best Smartphone"" title last year with the Pixel 8 and now the renamed Smartphone of the Year award with the Pixel 9 Pro.
While the Google Pixel 9 Pro wins the 2025 award, it's important to remember the criteria for eligible devices. ""The Best Smartphone award combines outstanding performance, innovation and leadership as determined through assessment of smartphones on the market during the period January 2024 to December 2024, by world leading independent analysts, journalists and influencers,"" according to GLOMO (emphasis theirs).
Like usual, that means the Pixel 9 Pro competed with the likes of the iPhone 16 Pro Max and the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, but did not face the latest Samsung Galaxy S25 series.

Gemini's award for Breakthrough Device Innovation represents the second time the honor has been given to a software feature. The last time that happened was in 2023, when Apple won it for Emergency SOS via satellite. The award is described as being ""for core hardware and software innovation within smartphone devices themselves.""
Google won half of the total awards available in the ""Device"" category of GLOMO's honors at MWC 2025, in a significant milestone for the company.

Equity markets experienced a significant downturn amid escalating trade tensions, with both the Dow Jones and the S&P 500 incurring substantial losses. The market sell-off was triggered by President Trump’s firm stance on tariffs. In our analysis of defense sector stocks, we identify General Dynamics (NYSE: GD) as a more attractive investment opportunity than Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT). Presently, both stocks are valued at roughly 17x forward earnings. Nevertheless, our analysis indicates that GD is likely to outperform LMT in the upcoming years, propelled by its robust revenue growth trajectory and superior profitability metrics.
This evaluation is based on a comprehensive analysis of several key factors, including historical revenue performance, investment returns, and comparative valuation metrics. In the analysis that follows, we will explore in greater detail the reasons behind our belief that General Dynamics is a more attractive investment option in the defense industry over the next three years. However, if you prefer an option that offers a smoother ride compared to an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and delivered >91% returns since inception.
General Dynamics recorded an average annual revenue growth of 7.5% from 2021 to 2024, increasing from $38 billion to $48 billion. In contrast, Lockheed Martin achieved an average annual growth of 2.0%, with its revenue rising from $67 billion to $71 billion during the same period. Additionally, over the trailing twelve months, General Dynamics’ sales growth of 12.9% significantly surpasses Lockheed Martin’s 5.1%.
Higher production volumes in critical programs, including Sikorsky helicopters and missile systems, have driven the growth of Lockheed Martin’s revenue in recent years. Moreover, increasing production contracts for the F-35 and national security space programs are significantly boosting sales. We expect this growth trend to persist, bolstered by ongoing geopolitical instability that is likely to sustain defense spending.
General Dynamics’ revenue is supported by strong performance across its core business segments. The aerospace division is a significant contributor, with increased aircraft deliveries, especially the G700, which started shipping in Q2, 2024 following regulatory approval. The company’s marine systems are also driving growth through higher production volumes on vital submarine programs. In addition, the combat systems division has experienced increased sales due to the U.S. Army’s M10 Booker vehicle program.
Between 2021 and 2024, Lockheed Martin saw its operating margin decline significantly, dropping from 13.6% to 9.9%, primarily because of a $1.4 billion loss in its classified programs in 2024. In comparison, General Dynamics experienced a more modest decrease in operating margin, from 10.8% to 10.1%, as a result of the initial delivery costs for the G700 aircraft.
In evaluating financial risk, both General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin exhibit a relatively balanced profile. While Lockheed Martin’s debt-to-equity ratio is 19%, which is higher than General Dynamics’ 15%, indicating slightly greater leverage, General Dynamics’ cash-to-assets ratio of 3% is lower than Lockheed Martin’s 4.5%, implying a smaller cash reserve. Essentially, General Dynamics has a stronger debt profile, whereas Lockheed Martin holds a more substantial cash position.
From early 2021 until now, General Dynamics’ stock has achieved an impressive 90% gain, increasing from roughly $135 to $255, thereby outperforming the S&P 500’s 55% gain over the same four-year span. Although GD posted positive annual returns throughout this period—44% in 2021, 22% in 2022, 7% in 2023, and 4% in 2024—it lagged behind the S&P 500 in 2023 and 2024.
In contrast, Lockheed Martin’s stock has risen by 45%, moving from approximately $315 to $450, which is below the S&P 500’s 55% gain. LMT’s performance was characterized by considerable volatility, with annual returns of 3% in 2021, 40% in 2022, -4% in 2023, and 10% in 2024. As a result, LMT underperformed the S&P 500 in 2021, 2023, and 2024. As an aside, amid increased economic uncertainty, and investors possibly becoming more defensive, see Kimberly-Clark Stock: Navigating Margin Growth And Market Challenges.
Our analysis indicates that General Dynamics is the more attractive investment when compared to Lockheed Martin. GD shows stronger revenue growth, improved profitability, and a similar financial risk profile. Additionally, its valuation is more appealing. At present, LMT stock is trading at 20.1 times its trailing adjusted earnings of $22.31 per share, which is slightly above its three-year average P/E ratio of 19.6. In contrast, GD stock is trading at 18.6 times its trailing earnings of $13.63 per share, falling below its three-year average P/E ratio of 19.9. While the current geopolitical climate is favorable for the entire defense sector, General Dynamics’ anticipated top-line growth, driven by the G700 aircraft, along with its marginally higher profitability, solidifies our preference for GD.
Although General Dynamics offers a strong investment case compared to Lockheed Martin, the High-Quality Portfolio, a carefully selected list of 30 stocks with a proven record of outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four years, provides another appealing option.

CANADA - 2025/02/14: In this photo illustration, the Yelp logo is seen displayed on a smartphone ... [+] screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)
 
Yelp’s stock (NASDAQ: YELP), an online platform for discovering local businesses ranging from bars, restaurants, and cafes to hairdressers, spas, and gas stations, has dropped 16% over the last month to around $34, underperforming the S&P 500 index’s 3% decline. Yelp’s Q4 performance exceeded expectations, with net revenue rising 6% year-over-year to $362 million and earnings per share surging to $0.62 (up 68% y-o-y), outpacing the $0.53 forecast. However, the company provided cautious guidance for 2025, citing macroeconomic uncertainties and ongoing operating challenges in the restaurants, retail, and other (RR&O) sectors. Also, refer to Tripadvisor’s Stock Down 30%, What’s Next? In addition, amid rising uncertainty and volatility, review Inflation to Sink S&P 500, Brace For Impact?
For 2025, Yelp anticipates net revenue between $1.470 billion and $1.485 billion (compared to $1.41 billion in FY 2024) and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $345 million to $360 million (vs $358 million in FY’24). The company’s outlook emphasizes high-margin opportunities in services advertising and AI-driven enhancements, despite macroeconomic and competitive challenges. If you prefer growth with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and delivered >91% returns since its inception.
In 2024, Yelp experienced a 6% year-over-year increase in net revenue, largely driven by a 6% rise in advertising revenues. The Services segment played a crucial role by achieving an 11% year-over-year growth in advertising revenue, reaching $879 million. This increase highlights the segment’s essential contribution to Yelp’s business model. Additionally, Yelp bolstered its presence in the auto services advertising market through the strategic acquisition of RepairPal for $80 million in Q4, positioning itself for incremental revenue growth. Conversely, the RR&O categories encountered difficulties, leading to a 3% decline in advertising revenue to $470 million, due to persistent economic pressures, changing consumer spending habits, and heightened competition from delivery service platforms.
Yelp registered significant achievements, including a 6% year-over-year growth in ad clicks and a 39% year-over-year rise in EPS to $1.88 over the full year. Moreover, adjusted EBITDA increased by 8% year-over-year to a record $358 million. However, the company experienced a 5% decline in total paying advertising locations, primarily due to the downturn in RR&O categories. As an aside, amid increased economic uncertainty, and investors possibly becoming more defensive, see Kimberly-Clark Stock: Navigating Margin Growth And Market Challenges.
We project Yelp’s Revenues to reach $1.5 billion for fiscal year 2025, up 5% year-over-year. In light of adjustments to our revenue and EPS forecasts, we have revised Yelp’s Valuation to $36 per share, based on an expected EPS of $2.28 and a 15.7x P/E multiple for fiscal year 2025, nearly matching the current market price (March 3).
Overall, YELP stock’s performance relative to the index over the past four years has been notably volatile. The stock delivered returns of 11% in 2021, -25% in 2022, 73% in 2023, and -18% in 2024. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, exhibits considerably less volatility. Moreover, it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500over the past four years. Why is that? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index, resulting in a less turbulent ride, as demonstrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
It is useful to see how Yelp compares with its peers. The YELP Peers section demonstrates Yelp’s performance against peers on key metrics. You can also find additional comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA - FEBRUARY 26: The Nvidia logo is displayed on a sign at the Nvidia ... [+] headquarters on February 26, 2025 in Santa Clara, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)
 
Nvidia stock fell nearly 9% during Monday’s trading session, while the broader Nasdaq index declined by just over 2%. The market-wide sell-off coincided with U.S. President Donald Trump’s confirmation that his administration would impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico starting Tuesday. Additionally, Nvidia’s drop was further exacerbated by investigations into Chinese buyers suspected of bypassing U.S. export controls on advanced semiconductor chips. How will these developments affect Nvidia stock?
We do not believe that the Trump Administration’s initial tariffs will have a material impact on Nvidia. Nvidia’s chips are primarily manufactured by TSMC in Taiwan; however, some systems and computers utilizing these chips are produced in other regions, including Mexico. It is possible that these segments of the business might experience some impact. Nonetheless, the core of Nvidia’s operations—the high-margin GPU division—should remain mostly unaffected. Last month, President Trump also suggested the possibility of a “25% or higher” tariff on all semiconductor chips imported into the United States. Investors will need to monitor this development closely, although we believe it will not have a significant impact on Nvidia’s bottom line. As of 2024, Nvidia reported an adjusted gross margin of approximately 75.5%, indicating that the cost of its imported products is likely less than 25% of its revenues. Furthermore, since Nvidia generates around 47% of its sales from the U.S., the impact on its margins is probably even more constrained. In addition, TSMC, which is Nvidia’s main contract manufacturer for GPUs, has announced plans to invest roughly $100 billion in new chip fabrication facilities in the United States. Nvidia executives have indicated that they plan to produce chips at these new facilities, potentially helping the company mitigate long-term tariff risks. However, if you are seeking growth with less volatility than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since its inception.
The United States has implemented export control restrictions on most of Nvidia’s newest AI chipset offerings to China, with the exception of the H20 chips, due to national security concerns. Nevertheless, reports indicate that gray market resellers are utilizing entities registered outside China to purchase servers incorporating Nvidia’s latest offerings from companies based in several countries, such as Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Vietnam. This concern is substantiated by the fact that Singapore has emerged as Nvidia’s second-largest market, representing approximately $23 billion in sales in FY’25, or about 18% of revenue, compared to only $2.3 billion, or 8% of revenue, in FY’23. Singapore has now launched an investigation into these potential loopholes.
The emergence of China’s DeepSeek open-source AI model also suggests that the country is advancing significantly in AI, with both prominent startups and major companies like Alibaba and Baidu investing heavily in AI infrastructure. Should Chinese companies bypass sanctions and face stricter enforcement measures that eventually close these loopholes, Nvidia’s revenues could be affected.
Over the past four years, NVDA stock's performance has been inconsistent, with annual returns displaying much greater volatility than the S&P 500. The stock returned 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, 239% in 2023, and 171% in 2024. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, which comprises 30 stocks, exhibits significantly less volatility. It has also comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four years. Why is this the case? Overall, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index, resulting in a less turbulent performance as demonstrated in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics. In light of the current uncertain macroeconomic climate, marked by potential rate cuts and several conflicts, might NVDA experience a scenario similar to 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months, or will it experience a robust surge?
We estimate Nvidia stock to be valued at approximately $101 per share, which is about 20% below the current market price. Refer to our analysis of Nvidia valuation: Expensive or Cheap. There are several reasons why we currently hold a negative outlook on the stock. We believe that the AI wave, driven by a “fear-of-missing-out” over the past two years, might subside due to diminishing incremental performance improvements from larger models and because high-quality training data may become a bottleneck. This transition towards more efficient models could further intensify the effects of a potential slowdown for GPU manufacturers like Nvidia. Additionally, Nvidia is encountering increasing competition from companies such as AMD and even from its own clients, like Amazon, which are focusing on developing and deploying their own AI chips. Although Nvidia boasts a comprehensive software ecosystem surrounding its AI processors—including programming languages that help secure customer loyalty—the company could still face pressure. Its premium valuation might not fully account for these risks at present.

57,2025-03-05,"Tri-fold smartphone designs were a prominent feature at MWC 2025, with Tecno’s Phantom Ultimate 2 standing out as a notable contender. First teased in August 2024, the device was shown off in a glass enclosure.
While I was unable to go hands-on with this concept foldable phone, I did manage to persuade a Tecno representative to remove it from the case to demonstrate the folding and unfolding mechanism, offering a closer look at this concept device.
The Phantom Ultimate 2’s most striking feature when I first saw it is its noticeably thin profile when unfolded. At a mere 3.5mm at its thinnest point, it surpasses the Honor Magic V3, currently considered the thinnest book-style foldable smartphone on the market at 4.35mm unfolded.
Of course, Tecno has yet to release this publicly but it’s an impressive feat nevertheless. It also hasn’t given us an indication of how much its tri-fold would cost if the handset was to make it out of concept and into stores, but going by the other premium foldable phones on the market, it’ll be a lot.
When folded, the device maintains an 11mm thickness, and while that’s thicker than a standard smartphone, it’s still pretty impressive considering its trifold nature.
It means it’s thinner than the first trifold phone to hit the market (in China and Malaysia at least), the Huawei Mate XT Ultimate when both folded and unfolded.
The triple-array camera bump is integrated into a symmetrically raised body that extends across that part of the device, providing a notable illusion that adds some bulk even if my eyes didn’t notice it at first. I would love to throw this device in my pocket to see how friendly and comfortable it is in daily use.
The Phantom Ultimate 2 boasts impressive display specs, with an outer display featuring a 6.48-inch OLED 3K LTPO screen with 392 PPI when folded.
It looks like a pretty competitive and natural candybar smartphone in that configuration with the Android operating system scaling in an uncompromising way.
Fully unfolded, the display measures a sizable 10 inches at a 4:3 aspect ratio. The display looked rich in color and had sharp and clear fidelity to my eyes. Fold creases were noticeable but not in a particularly unsightly way.
Tecno has coupled the display with a thin hinge system for the Phantom Ultimate 2, which it claims can withstand over 300,000 folds. In a device that has two separate folding areas, this type of durability is even more crucial.
From what I could see during the demonstration, the folding action appeared robust and stable with noticeable resistance that helped the device hold its form in various positions.
The Tecno Phantom Ultimate 2 can be fully folded for traditional mobile use in smartphone mode, fully unfolded for a large 10-inch display experience in tablet mode, set up in tent mode for media consumption or drawing applications, or arranged in laptop mode with one display flat on the table showing an on-screen keyboard while the other two displays extend vertically for better multitasking. This sort of flexibility is a big selling point for the tri-fold design.
Having seen tri-fold designs online and from a distance before this trip to Barcelona, I find myself more convinced at their place in the smartphone market.
As a concept, there’s no way to know exactly when it might hit the market if at all, but I really like where Tecno is headed with the Phantom Ultimate 2.
You may be disappointed if you hoped that Samsung would enhance the charging speed for its future foldable devices. Recently leaked certifications confirm that the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7 will maintain the same wired charging speeds as their predecessors.
According to China’s 3C authority (via Android Headlines), which recently certified both handsets, both phones are expected to retain a charging speed of 25W and feature a dedicated Samsung EP-TA800 charger, which maxes out at 25W.
The Google Pixel 9a is here and it has a brand new look, some new features, a tempting price, and a very tough time ahead of it. The curvy shape of the Google Pixel 8a has gone, replaced by a flat rear panel and flat sides. Not only that, but the iconic Pixel visor-style camera module has disappeared too, and the two cameras have been integrated into the back of the phone. That’s right, there’s no camera bump at all, making it look very unusual in 2025.
Whether you already miss the best design Google has ever come up with on its phones will be down to your personal taste, but if you get the Pixel 9a in the right color, it’ll still make a statement. Along with the ordinary Porcelain and Obsidian (white and black to you and me) models, there are two eye-catching versions: the purple Iris and the red-pink Peony. The Pixel 9a has an IP68 dust and water resistance rating, the rear is made from plastic, and the chassis is aluminum.
There have been no end of rumours surrounding the iPhone 17 Air – or iPhone 17 Slim as it has also been called – and the latest adds some fuel to an existing fire. Previous reports have suggested the slimmer iPhone 17 model will feature a camera module that spans the width of the device, not too dissimilar from what Google offers on its Pixel 9 series though closer to the top of the phone. 
The most recent leak supports this idea, with Sonny Dickson sharing an image on X of what he claims is a first peek at a third party case for the iPhone 17 Air. Accompanying the image, Dickson said: ""Here’s your first look at a case for the iPhone 17 Air. If you didn’t know an Air was coming, you’d swear it was a Google Pixel case.""

, Forbes Staff. 
New research shows that when companies decry short sellers, there's good reason to not go long the stock.
Short sellers make for easy villains. They root for stocks to fall, profit when companies struggle, and are generally unwelcome at shareholder meetings. CEOs love to call them out—sometimes for sport, sometimes to shift the blame.
Short-selling is legal—investors borrow shares, sell them, and try to buy them back cheaper. Naked short-selling is not. That’s selling shares without borrowing them first, creating phantom shares that distort the market. The SEC cracked down on that in 2008, and there’s little evidence it happens in any real way. But that hasn’t stopped the finger-pointing, the blame games, the innuendo.
Devin Nunes, CEO of Trump Media and Technology Group, which runs the Truth Social social media platform, took his shot last year, sending a letter to Nasdaq in April urging an investigation into possible naked short-selling by market makers like VIRTU Americas, G1 Execution Services, Jane Street Capital, and billionaire Ken Griffin’s Citadel Securities.
While those who don’t see short sellers as scapegoats tend to brush off these complaints—Griffin called Nunes a “loser” in response to the letter—the accusations still reveal something. A new study, Trade as I Say, Not as I Do: Management Rhetoric and Insider Stock Sales, cuts through the noise—of which there is plenty (the combined market capitalization of the companies throwing around anti-short-selling buzzwords in the study was $163 billion, measured as of March 2021, at the tail end of the original meme stock mania). And while the complaints don’t hold up under scrutiny, what happens next is harder to ignore.
The research shows that when executives start talking about the shorts, they don’t dig in to defend their supposedly undervalued stock. The paper, written by researchers from the University of Kansas and Appalachian State University in North Carolina, shows they do something entirely different. The CliffNotes: the same executives claiming their stock is being crushed by short sellers are, at the same time, more likely to be selling their own shares. The likelihood of insider sales jump 70% after companies make these claims—which, if they actually believed short sellers were unfairly driving down prices, would be the last thing they’d do.
So why do it? Maybe it’s because post GameStop, there’s a receptive audience, looking to pounce on the next short squeeze. “The people the message [anti-short selling rhetoric] resonates with are the most unsophisticated in the market by any measure,” says Justin Balthrop, one of the researchers and a professor of finance at the University of Kansas.
Balthrop and his colleagues hope their findings will help put a stop to companies “riling” people up only to use them for “exit liquidity.”
The researchers analyzed public company statements, insider trading records, and financial filings to track how executives talk about short sellers and what they do afterward. They looked at cases where companies used anti-short-selling narratives—press releases, earnings calls, interviews—and then checked whether insiders sold shares, the company issued new stock, or financial restatements followed. By comparing these patterns against firms that didn’t use this rhetoric, they could see if there was a real connection between the claims and what happened next. The full sample set included 4,292 companies, of which 103 used anti-short selling rhetoric between 2018 and 2019. Furthermore, penny stocks were excluded from the study (the average market capitalization as of March 2021 for the 103 firms was about $1.6 billion).
“This is a phenomenon that didn’t exist, these anti-short selling buzzwords were virtually non-existent [in filings and transcripts] prior to 2021,” says Balthrop.
That’s not because short-selling has suddenly ramped up, the paper notes.
“We didn’t find any kind of abnormal uptick” in measures of short-selling that would explain the emergence of anti-short selling rhetoric, says Jonathan Bitting, a finance professor at Appalachian State University, and one of the paper’s authors. Ryan Clark, a coauthor and finance Ph.D. candidate at the University of Kansas, calls out that even within individual companies, short interest often barely changes when executives start railing against short sellers.
If shorting was really the problem, why didn’t they speak up earlier? Many of these companies only started complaining after GameStop made short squeezes a rallying cry—when blaming short sellers suddenly garnered an audience.
The pattern doesn’t stop at insider sales. The research found that companies that push anti-short-selling theories are also 154% more likely to sell additional stock. That means they’re selling new shares to raise cash, which dilutes existing shareholders and often drives the stock price down even further.
Again, if the company truly believed their stock was unfairly undervalued, selling more of it wouldn’t make sense. But when retail traders buy into the narrative, it creates the perfect setup—higher demand, better pricing, and an easy way for the company to raise cash.
The paper makes one thing clear: short-selling activity doesn’t drive the rhetoric—rhetoric comes first, and then the insiders sell. That’s not a defense against market manipulation. That’s executives using a convenient story, one that’s often hard to disprove, to potentially offload shares.
Even more worrisome, the researchers found that these companies are 400% more likely to issue major accounting restatements down the line, suggesting the real problem isn’t short sellers—it’s what’s in the books. These restatements can be catastrophic; studies have shown that a restatement leads to an average stock-price drop of 10%, and more than 20% in cases involving accounting irregularities.
Trump Media & Technology Group’s stock, which has a market capitalization of $4.9 billion, has plunged 30% since it lodged its complaint last year, compared to a 14% gain for the S&P 500 Index over the same time period. Though insiders haven’t sold a meaningful amount of shares since then—most sales were for tax withholding purposes—the company did submit reaudited financials last June after its previous auditor, BF Borgers, was charged with “massive fraud” by the SEC. The firm and its owner, Benjamin Borgers, were fined $14 million and permanently banned from examining public companies. Furthermore, the stock dropped by 6% on July 5th of last year, the first day of trading after the company disclosed it would sell up to 38 million additional shares."
60,2025-03-05,"US President Donald Trump declared ""the American Dream is unstoppable"" as he addressed a raucous joint session of Congress for the first time since he returned to power.
In the longest presidential speech to lawmakers on record, he outlined his vision for his second term, as Republicans applauded a high-octane six weeks that has reshaped domestic and foreign policy.
Trump was heckled by Democrats and he goaded them in turn during the rowdy primetime address, during which he said his administration was ""just getting started"".
The Republican president has moved to slash the federal workforce and crack down on immigration, while imposing tariffs on the US's biggest trading partners and shaking up the transatlantic alliance over the war in Ukraine.
Here are six of the key takeaways.
Following a second day of market turbulence, Trump played down the potential economic fallout from a trade war he ignited this week, including 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10% on Chinese imports.
But in contrast with the ovations that greeted his other policy objectives, many Republicans remained seated, a sign of how Trump's import taxes have divided his party.
""Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again,"" he said.
""And it's happening. And it will happen rather quickly. There'll be a little disturbance, but we're okay with that. It won't be much.""
Trump added that reciprocal tariffs tailored to US trading partners would ""kick in"" on 2 April.
Earlier in the day, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox Business that Trump could announce a trade deal with Mexico and Canada as soon as Wednesday.
Trump said he had received an ""important letter"" from Ukraine's leader earlier in the day, which appeared to match what Volodymyr Zelensky posted publicly on social media.
Ukraine's president had said he was now ready to work under Trump's ""strong leadership"" to end the war and ""come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer"".
""I appreciate that he sent this letter,"" Trump told lawmakers.
Zelensky offered the olive branch a day after Trump paused all military aid to the beleaguered US ally.
It followed an acrimonious Oval Office meeting last week when the two leaders argued in front of TV cameras, before cancelling plans to sign a minerals deal that would allow the US to profit from an economic partnership involving Ukraine's natural resources.
Trump was reportedly hoping to announce during his speech to Congress that the  deal had finally been sealed. But it did not materialise.
Despite most of his 99-minute speech focusing on domestic issues, Trump's worldview also came more sharply into focus.
There are places in the world he wants to expand US influence and others where he wants to withdraw.
Repeating his desire for the US to acquire Greenland, he vowed ""we're going to get it - one way or the other"". And he said his administration would ""reclaim"" the Panama Canal.
There were several mentions of African countries when he rattled through a long list of aid programmes funded by US taxpayers that he portrayed as ridiculous.
Liberia, Mali, Mozambique and Uganda were all places where he suggested money had been wasted.
But his most pointed remark was about Lesotho, which he said was a country ""nobody has ever heard of"" despite receiving $8m (£6.2m) to promote LGBT rights.
The government there quickly responded. 
""To my surprise, 'the country that nobody has heard of' is the country where the US has a permanent mission,"" Foreign Affairs Minister Lejone Mpotjoane told the BBC.
Early on, Trump name-checked his billionaire adviser Elon Musk, who was watching from the gallery.
The tech mogul's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) taskforce has moved to fire tens of thousands of federal workers, cut billions of dollars in foreign aid and slash programmes across the US government.
The SpaceX and Tesla boss, wearing a dark suit with a blue tie, stood and acknowledged the cheers from the crowd.
""Thank you, Elon,"" the 78-year-old president said. ""He's working very hard. He didn't need this.""
Musk's cuts have sparked some angry scenes at town hall meetings and his instructions to federal employees have at times been overruled by members of Trump's cabinet.
In the chamber, Democratic lawmakers held up signs saying ""Musk steals"" and ""false"".
Doge claims to have saved $105bn already, but that figure can't be independently verified. Receipts have been published for $18.6bn worth of savings, but accounting errors have been reported by US media outlets that have analysed the figures.
Within the first five minutes of the address, Al Green of Texas was escorted out of the chamber by the sergeant-at-arms after refusing to comply with the House Speaker's demands that he stop heckling the president and take his seat.
As Trump spoke, other Democrats held up signs saying: ""This is a lie.""
With Republicans in control of the White House, House of Representatives and Senate, Democrats have been largely leaderless as they work to hone their message and counter the blitz of activity from the Trump administration.
Many Democratic women arrived in the House chamber wearing pink pantsuits in protest. Dozens from their party - some of them wearing the words ""Resist"" printed on the backs of their shirts - exited the chamber during the speech.
""There is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy,"" Trump said, appearing to revel in the partisan rancour.
Democratic leadership chose Elissa Slotkin of Michigan - a first-term senator elected in a battleground state that Trump won in November - to deliver the party's official response.
She accused Trump of an ""unprecedented giveaway to his billionaire friends"" and warned that ""he could walk us right into a recession"".
Trump pledged to voters that he would beat inflation on his return to office and he used the speech to say his focus would be to reduce the cost of energy, by opening up the country to new oil and gas drilling.
""We have more liquid gold under our feet than any nation on earth, and by far, and now I fully authorize the most talented team ever assembled to go and get it. It's called drill, baby, drill.""
The soaring cost of eggs has been headline news in recent weeks, and Trump made clear who he felt was responsible.
""Joe Biden especially let the price of eggs get out of control - and we are working hard to get it back down,"" he added.
Egg prices rose as the Biden administration directed millions of egg-laying birds to be culled last year amid a bird flu outbreak, though prices have continued rising during the early stages of Trump's second presidency.
Inflation was slightly elevated at 3% last month, but way down from its peak of 9.1% in 2022.
Only one in three Americans approve of Trump's handling of cost of living, according to a Reuters/Ipsos survey on Tuesday.

	After years of teasing cameos, Marvel’s the Man without Fear is finally back in Daredevil: Born Again, and the Disney+ show’s timing is fearlessly fantastic.

	As Donald Trump prepares to address Congress tonight amidst tariffs, a stock market slump and dangerous intranational realignments and anxiety, it is a reminder it has become impossible the past month not to see almost everything through the distorted lens of a convicted felon president’s latest reign of terror and error.  

	With terms like “resist” and “retribution” employed in the long-awaited and creatively retooled Charlie Cox-led Born Again, the first Daredevil series since 2018 lines up to the real America of 2025 on a number of levels. Certainly, with the City Hall-aspiring Kingpin (Vincent D’Onofrio) promising five boroughs voters to “keep our streets safe” to grab absolute power to abuse for riches, there is a lot of MAGA here, as well as a lot of creativity and history.

	










			Watch on Deadline		






	Debuting tonight with two episodes, Born Again is much more Taxi Driver and Goodfellas than the bland MCU series of recent years — with the very noteworthy exception of last year’s Echo. In fact, the nine-episode first season of the series starring Deborah Ann Woll, Elden Henson, Clark Johnson, Wilson Bethel, a great Michael Gandolfini and Ayelet Zurer has a lot of familiar faces.

	Yes, there’s a lot in Daredevil: Born Again that we’ve seen before, and the series is clearly linked to the Marvel series from before. There’s a lot of legacy and lore here, but there is also something new and unleashed – which is why Daredevil: Born Again, created by Matt Corman, Chris Ord and Dario Scardapane, may be the best Marvel series since the original Daredevil wrapped on Netflix seven years ago.

	Grimy, amoral in the highest offices and ultraviolent in a way Walt Disney probably never envisioned for his Magic Kingdom, Born Again has the same acidic taste and smell on it of our grifter-ravaged nation divided upon itself and increasingly the Free World. That connection grounds Born Again from its Hell’s Kitchen origins to Gracie Mansion and the metropolis’ tunnels and secrets.

	In that context, just like that ostentatious 2015 trip down a certain Trump Tower elevator, the “Fisk Can Fix It” candidacy of Kingpin/Wilson Fisk and his “get sh*t done” ethos barely keeps its menace hidden. Which for comic fans and political junkies alike is sheer mana.

	










	No spoilers, and we all know a second season is coming, but the Scardapane-showrun Daredevil: Born Again also kicks ass – literally and figuratively. For one thing, Born Again gets Cox in the suit ASAP and cuts to the chase almost as fast with an assassin’s fatal hand and a cop-bar brawl that truly shoots out the lights.

	I said no spoilers, but I will give you one: Although it’s Charlie Cox’s Daredevil’s name in the title, this is very much the Jon Bernthal-portrayed Punisher’s tale too.

	Returning to the rooftops of the Big Apple as he did in the original Daredevil and his own two-season show, the bloodthirsty and much emulated in some circles Frank Castle, a role the versatile Bernthal owns now and then, is all the id that runs rampant in an America where militias and cop assaulters get presidential pardons.

	No wonder Disney and Marvel have already revealed that a Reinaldo Marcus Green-directed Punisher special is set for their streamer in the future.

	So, to paraphrase Wilson Fisk: Daredevil and Punisher, it is absolutely not entirely unpleasant to see you again. Glad you’re sticking around.

CANADA - 2025/02/25: In this photo illustration, the Li Auto logo is seen displayed on a smartphone ... [+] screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)
 
Li Auto delivered 26,263 vehicles in February, representing an increase of nearly 30% compared to the previous year, even though sales dropped by 12% from the prior month. For the second consecutive month, the longtime leader’s sales were outpaced by its competitor Xpeng, which delivered 30,453 vehicles in February—an increase of over 6.5x from 4,545 in the same month last year. Nio stock reported 13,863 vehicle deliveries in February, marking a 62% rise from the year-ago period. Although Li Auto did not detail the primary factors behind its growth, it is likely that the Li L6, the most affordable model in its lineup, contributed to the year-over-year increase in volumes. As an aside, amid increased economic uncertainty, and investors possibly becoming more defensive, see Kimberly-Clark Stock: Navigating Margin Growth And Market Challenges.
The initial months of the year are generally slow for the Chinese automotive market due to the Chinese New Year celebrations, which take place between late January and mid-February. Therefore, a more accurate year-over-year comparison is to combine January and February deliveries and compare them to the same period last year. In this instance, Li Auto sold a total of 56,190 vehicles for January and February combined, which is an increase of approximately 9% from 51,416 units in the previous year.
Li’s overall sales growth has been sluggish. Why might this be? One reason is that the company conducted significant year-end promotional sales at the close of last year, which likely advanced demand and resulted in weaker sales in January and February. Moreover, fierce competition in the Chinese EV market is putting pressure on both volume growth and average selling prices, with over 100 brands competing for market share. The company has long relied on its gasoline-powered range extenders to boost vehicle sales; however, as charging infrastructure continues to improve, that advantage may be waning, making the successful delivery of popular pure EVs more critical. Additionally, Li’s first fully electric model, the MEGA van—which does not include the gasoline range extender found in its other vehicles—has not met expectations. Priced at over $70,000, this vehicle targets the high-end EV market. Furthermore, Li Auto trails behind competitors such as Tesla and domestic players like Xpeng in autonomous driving technology, which may be affecting its competitive edge.
Although Li Auto stock has experienced modest growth in recent years, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, which comprises 30 stocks, has delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark S&P 500 index over the past four years—it has been less volatile, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. In light of the current uncertain macroeconomic environment—characterized by potential rate cuts and multiple conflicts—could Li Auto encounter a similar situation as in previous years and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months, or is a recovery on the horizon?
Despite the risks, Li Auto’s valuation remains appealing. The stock is trading at approximately $27 per share, or around 17x consensus 2025 earnings. The company’s revenues are forecast to increase by a robust 30% in 2025, according to estimates. By contrast, U.S. rival Tesla is trading at about 100x consensus earnings, even though its revenues are expected to grow by only around 15% this year.
How might Li Auto’s stock trend upward? Although the underwhelming performance of Li’s Fire pure EV model has dampened investor sentiment, the company plans to introduce additional pure EV models, including the Li i8 SUV, anticipated around July. If this new model gains traction, it could enhance investor confidence in Li’s prospects within the battery electric vehicle market. Moreover, Li Auto stock could benefit from increased foreign capital inflows into China, spurred by the government’s generous stimulus measures and growing optimism regarding the nation’s technology and R&D capabilities following the launch of the DeepSeek AI model. Should investors adopt a more favorable valuation—approximately 35x forward earnings—reflecting Li Auto’s stronger growth prospects, the stock might experience significant upside, potentially reaching about $54 per share. For a detailed comparison of Li Auto stock with its rivals, Nio and Xpeng, see our analysis of Nio, Xpeng & Li Auto: How Do Chinese EV Stocks Compare?.

64,2025-03-05,"Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Galaxy Z Fold 6 users can try it this week.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Samsung will publicly release One UI 7 starting in April 2025, the company announced today in a press release. The launch month is expected to be the conclusion of a lengthy development and rollout process, which included a beta program that started in December 2024 and has seen multiple delays. The company will introduce three One UI 7 beta programs before the official rollout, for the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6, Galaxy S23 series, and Galaxy Tab S10 series.
Users became antsy for One UI 7 to hit older devices after it debuted on the Samsung Galaxy S25 series earlier this year, and arrived on the new budget Galaxy A series just last week.
Now, the company is confirming that a One UI 7 beta program for the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6 will become available starting this week. To join the One UI 7 beta program, you can apply in the Samsung Members app with an eligible device. Act fast if you want to try it, because Samsung eventually closed sign-ups for the One UI 7 beta program on the Galaxy S24 series.
After expanding to the 2024 lineup of Galaxy foldables, Samsung will bring a One UI 7 beta program to the Galaxy S23 series and the Galaxy Tab S10 series. Just like for the other Galaxy devices, users can register for the beta program in the Samsung Members app. The company notes that the beta will be available in India, Korea, the U.K., and the U.S., and that ""availability may vary by device model and market.""
Samsung explains in the press release that One UI 7 integrates ""leading AI agents with multimodal capabilities into every touch point of the interface.""
Notably, the company also reminds users in the footnotes that Galaxy AI features are only going to be provided for free until the end of 2025. Samsung could always extend that timeline, but it's starting to look like it might charge for Galaxy AI at some point.
After numerous delays, users of older Galaxy devices are finally in the home stretch, as Samsung confirms that One UI 7 will reach public availability and stability next month.

65,2025-03-05,"The Apple iPhone 16e is still fresh on the shelves, but a tip from Fixed Focus Digital suggests the Apple iPhone 17e is all-but guaranteed. For reference, Fixed Focus Digital was the first to suggest the “16e” name when everyone else — ourselves included — guess it would be called the iPhone SE 4.
The continuation of the “1xe” naming system makes sense. With the apparent death of the “SE” lineup, the 16e and any future iterations are in a prime spot to take its place. Fixed Focus Digital shared the news on Weibo, saying “I see 17e there. The digital e-series is not a short-lived model.” The original post was not in English, so allow some room for potential translation errors.
That theory is further backed up by predictions from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP). “It appears that “e” phones may be part of the program going forward. Following the core iPhone 17 model launches in September, we expect Apple to announce an iPhone 17e around this time next year. That would mimic Google’s introduction of “a” models in its Pixel line months after the annual Spring launch of their flagship and Pro models in recent years.”
Citing the similarities between the iPhone 16 and the iPhone 16e, CIRP suggests the increased price of the 16e is a non-starter because of what it brings to the table. The $599 price matches that of the iPhone 14, effectively removing it from the competition.
CIRP goes on to state that the iPhone SE had only a “modest” market share that made it less profitable than expected, especially in comparison to the much more popular iPhone 5c, which last only one generation before becoming the iPhone SE.
Apple is likely to launch the iPhone 17e to continue to fill the market gap left behind by the iPhone SE, but whether it continues to iPhone 18e and beyond will depend on sales performance and customer adoption.
Apple Wallet has seen several improvements recently, but the most recent update changes Subscriptions & Payments to Preauthorized Payments. This naming scheme is more straightforward and clear about what it does, and it also gives you an idea of any upcoming payments.
This feature is only present in the most recent version of the iOS 18.4 beta, though.

Ever since we first heard murmurs of Apple prepping an ultra-slim iPhone, speculations were rife about a fittingly high asking price. But it seems buyers won’t get hit with an absurd “innovation tax” for the iPhone 17 Air model later this year.
According to Bloomberg, the upcoming phone might be priced at “roughly $900.” To put that into perspective, that’s the same asking price as the iPhone 16 Plus. To recall, the iPhone 17 Air is expected to replace the “Plus” model in Apple’s line-up later this year.
A few pleasant surprises
The package, however, is going to be a mixed bag of surprises. For example, the slim phone is expected to offer a 6.6-inch display, but it will borrow the ProMotion display tech from the pricier Pro models. So far, the high refresh rate perk has been exclusive to Apple’s flagship iPhones and iPads. 
As the release for the iPhone 17 draws ever closer (expected in September 2025), more leaks have emerged — and now a set of dummy units give us a close look at the entire lineup, but specifically the iPhone 17 Air. This handset has been the source of quite a bit of speculation and rumors, and a peek at its profile shows a phone even slimmer than we had imagined.
The leaks come courtesy of Sonny Dickson, a well-known tipster. Dickson shared the images on X. It's important to remember that these units are chunks of metal; they have no electronics inside them, so we can't gauge specs based on the design. It does give us a firm look at the profile, however, and an idea of the placement of various components.

70,2025-03-05,"European defence stocks are flying high as Trump’s pause on aid to Ukraine spurs calls for continent’s rearmament.
As United States President Donald Trump’s tariffs and his shift in Washington’s Ukraine policy send shivers through global stock markets, Europe’s defence firms are flying high as investors bet on the continent taking charge of its own defence.
With Trump’s outreach to Russia and his suspension of military aid to Ukraine raising doubt about US commitment to Europe’s security, European leaders are racing to ramp up defence spending.
After racking up double-digit gains this week, shares of top European defence companies are cruising at all-time highs as investors look to profit from Trump’s “America First” shake-up of the international order.
Germany’s Rheinmetall and Hensoldt, which rose as much as 9 percent on Wednesday, are up more than 90 percent and 100 percent, respectively, since the start of the year.
Italy’s Leonardo and France’s Thales have both gained more than 70 percent, while the United Kingdom’s BAE Systems is up about 40 percent.
In stark contrast, the benchmark S&P 500, which tracks the performance of 500 of the biggest US companies, has dipped nearly 5 percent during the past month and is down 1.5 percent compared to the beginning of 2025.
“In response to Trump and [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, Europe will raise its defence spending significantly. That is very positive for its defence companies,” Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, told Al Jazeera.
“Their long-term prospects are bright. They will also find it easier to attract talent.”
 

 
Declaring that Europe had entered an “era of rearmament”, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Tuesday announced plans to mobilise up to 800 billion euros ($854bn) in new defence spending over four years.
Von der Leyen said 650 billion euros ($694bn) of the spending could be achieved by member states raising their defence budgets by 1.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) – a near doubling of current expenditures.
NATO military planners have worked on the assumption that if Russia attacks Europe, the US would rapidly increase its 100,000 soldiers stationed on the continent to 300,000. However, the Trump administration has made clear that it wants Europe to lead its defence — calling into question just how much the US might support Europe in such a scenario.
Brussels-based think tank Bruegel has estimated that if Europe did not have the US security umbrella under NATO, it would need to assemble an additional fighting force of 300,000 soldiers to repel a Russian attack on a European country. NATO’s European members have a combined two million active-duty soldiers at present.
Despite rising by nearly one-third from 2021 to 2024, the European Union’s combined defence spending lags far behind the US and falls just short of NATO’s target for expenditures equalling 2 percent of GDP.
The EU’s military-related expenditures in 2024 came to 326 billion euros ($348bn), or about 1.9 percent of the combined GDP, according to the European Defence Agency.
NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte has said the members of the alliance, which includes all but four of the EU states as well as the US, Canada, and the United Kingdom, would need to raise defence budgets to “considerably more” than 3 percent of GDP.
Trump, who has repeatedly accused Europe of freeloading on US security guarantees, has pushed for NATO members to spend 5 percent of GDP.
“We anticipate European defence expenditure will reach 3.1 percent of GDP by 2029 and climb further to 3.5 percent by 2032,” Loredana Muharremi, an equity analyst for Morningstar, told Al Jazeera.
“Should Europe reach 3.5 percent of GDP by 2032, this would translate on average to an additional $300bn per year, marking a 70 percent increase from 2024 levels.”
The bulk of this increased spending should benefit European defence contractors through “increased intra-European procurement and industry consolidation,” Muharremi said.
Muharremi said the European defence sector also stands to benefit from bigger economies of scale.
“Currently, Europe imports 26 percent of its defence equipment, with 60 percent of those imports coming from the US. While we do not expect Europe to halt US procurement – given the immediate need for off-the-shelf capabilities and long-term technological synergies – we anticipate a significant shift towards intra-European procurement,” she said.
 

 
Europe’s defence industry generated a turnover of 158.8 billion euros ($169.5bn) in 2023, up about 17 percent from the previous year, according to the Aerospace, Security and Defence Industries Association of Europe.
Still, the continent’s defence sector has long lagged behind its US counterpart in business terms. US firms took seven spots on the list of the 10 highest-grossing defence contractors in 2024, including the top five.
According to a 2021 report by Strategy&, a unit of PricewaterhouseCoopers, US defence firms grew their revenues 20 percent to $277bn from 2014 to 2019, while European firms’ revenues stagnated over the period at about $100.4bn.
“So far, the European defence industry lacked the scale of their US counterparts, and was characterised by a high level of fragmentation in terms of variety of weapon systems,” Tobias Mueller, a researcher in defence economics at the HHL Leipzig Graduate School of Management, told Al Jazeera.
“Going forward they need to drive consolidation of the industry, increase efficiency and effectiveness, invest into innovative defence technologies, and improve the resilience of the supply chain and invest into public-private partnerships.”
Mueller said the US’s shift in focus away from Europe’s security could be a golden opportunity for the European defence sector to level up.
“This is the ‘last call’ for Europe to invest in more defence capabilities,” he said.

With the talking heads spinning narrative’s day in and day out, investors can feel more confused than ever. As the S&P 500 falls from record highs, investors may be wondering how to navigate this market?
There is one straight answer: make sure you’ve done your diligence and understand the true cash flows of the underlying business you’re looking to invest in (or already own).
The sole purpose of my Most Dangerous Stocks Model Portfolio is to find the worst of the worst stocks in any kind of market. The stocks in this Model Portfolio have both terrible fundamentals and expensive valuations. In other words, the risk/reward for these stocks is very dangerous.
To help my readers protect their portfolios, here’s a stock pick from this Model Portfolio.
This feature provides a concise summary of how I pick stocks for this Model Portfolio. It is not a full Danger Zone report, but it gives you insight into the rigor of my firm’s research and approach to picking stocks.
Dayforce Inc. (DAY) is the featured stock from February’s Most Dangerous Stocks Model Portfolio.
Dayforce’s net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) margin fell from 9% in 2018 to 5% in the TTM, while the company’s invested capital turns rose from 0.3 to 0.4 over the same time. Falling NOPAT margins offset the improved capital turns and drive Dayforce’s return on invested capital (ROIC) from an already low 2.4% in 2018 to 1.9% in the TTM.
Dayforce’s economic earnings, a key component of the Golden Metric for picking stocks, fell from -$197 million in 2018 to -$389 million in the TTM. Meanwhile, the company’s GAAP net income rose from -$71 million to $53 million over the same time. Whenever GAAP earnings rise while economic earnings decline, investors should beware.
Figure 1: Dayforce’ Economic vs GAAP Earnings Since 2018
DAY Economic Earnings and Net Income 2018-TTM
Despite its poor and declining fundamentals, Dayforce’s stock is priced for significant profit growth, and I believe the stock is overvalued.
To justify its current price of $68/share, Dayforce must improve its NOPAT margin to 15% (above best-ever NOPAT margin of 10%) and grow revenue by 25% (compared to 15% over the five years) compounded annually over the next eight years. In this scenario, Dayforce grows its NOPAT 35% compounded annually to $2.1 billion in 2033. I think these expectations are overly optimistic, especially considering the company’s NOPAT grew just 4% compounded annually over the last five years.
Even if Dayforce improves its NOPAT margin to 10% (equal to best-ever NOPAT margin) and grows revenue 20% compounded annually through 2033, the stock would be worth no more than $28/share today – a 59% downside to the current stock price.
Each of these scenarios also assumes Dayforce can grow revenue, NOPAT, and FCF without increasing working capital or fixed assets. This assumption is unlikely but allows me to create best case scenarios that demonstrate the high expectations embedded in the current valuation.
Below are specifics on the adjustments I made based on Robo-Analyst findings in Dayforce’s 10-Qs and 10-Ks:
Income Statement: I made around $50 million in adjustments, with a net effect of removing just under $50 million in non-operating expenses.
Balance Sheet: I made over $1.1 billion in adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net decrease of just under $200 million. One of the most notable adjustments was for other comprehensive income.
Valuation: I made just under $1.8 billion in adjustments to shareholder value with a net decrease of just under $1.0 billion. The most notable adjustment to shareholder value was for total debt.

72,2025-03-05,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by nearly 500 points, recovering from a steep decline earlier in the week as the major U.S. automakers are given a one-month exemption from new tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports.
“We spoke with the Big Three auto dealers. We are going to give a one month exemption on any autos coming through USMCA,” President Donald Trump said, according to a statement provided by White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt during a news conference.
The news follows comments from Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who indicated that there might be potential tariff relief for Canada and Mexico. He suggested that the U.S. could be moving toward a compromise that is a “middle ground.”
As the day ended in New York, the S&P 500 added 1.1%, while the Nasdaq 100 climbed 1.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 485 points or 1.1%. Meanwhile, the job report came weak, raising concerns about stagflation. 
General Motors (GM+2.46%) stock surged more than 3% as the broader market rebounded in the morning. The rally appeared to be driven by investor optimism following Lutnick’s remarks suggesting potential tariff relief for Canada and Mexico.
Meanwhile, Ford (F+2.61%) also jumped 5% in the afternoon following the news. 
Shares of pharmaceutical giant Moderna (MRNA-1.15%) surged over 6% on Wednesday after strategic insider stock purchases by the company’s CEO and a board director. According to a recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, CEO Stephane Bancel and board director Paul Sagan acquired $6 million worth of Moderna shares.
Shares of Novo Nordisk (NVO-2.46%) climbed 3.5% after the company announced plans to sell its weight loss drug Wegovy at less than half its usual monthly price through a new direct-to-consumer online pharmacy.
CrowdStrike (CRWD+3.93%) stock fell 9% on Wednesday after the cybersecurity software company provided disappointing earnings guidance. The company gained significant attention last year following a widespread global tech outage linked to its software.

At the National People’s Congress, Premier Li provided the government work report. The lack of Western media coverage is interesting, so I pulled out the choice lines. Consumption comes up a lot, indicating where policy support is headed. Artificial intelligence was also explicitly mentioned. Real estate was not as big of a focus, though a large part of the bond issuance is linked to real estate support as local governments have been given more latitude to support project completion.
Jonathan Krane’s thesis in creating our firm was to align China investment products with government policy. We are looking good in 2025 as this top-down consumption directive is implemented by government agencies and local governments. Numerically, the report was largely in line with expectations that were low to begin with, though the verbal was stronger than anticipated. It is important that the government recognizes deflation because ignoring it means not fixing it. They did not ignore it. On Thursday, the heads of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, PBOC, and Ministry of Finance are hosting a press conference at 10 am Beijing time. Further articulation of consumption policies would be interesting.
China’s Uber for truck drivers company Full Truck Alliance (YMM U.S.) announced Q4 results after the Hong Kong close/pre-U.S. market opened.
Asian equities were higher overnight, led by Hong Kong, Thailand, and Indonesia, while Vietnam was off as Trump’s cabinet tried to talk up markets on tariff deals after the close as the U.S. dollar weakened. However, it is important to remember that Trump’s cabinet is made up of staff and not stakeholders, as only the big guy counts.
Hong Kong had a strong day, though volumes were a touch light, and advancers trounced decliners, led by Hong Kong’s most heavily traded stocks by value, including Xiaomi, +7.22%; Tencent, +2.95%; Alibaba, +1.64%; Meituan, +6.39%; and Semiconductor Manufacturing International, +6.6%. The NPC’s government work report contributed to Hong Kong-listed growth stocks' strong outperformance, though it was a broad rally.
Superman was flying as CK Hutchison (Hong Kong ticker 1, how cool is that) gained +21.86% after selling their Panama ports to BlackRock (founder Li Ka-Shing is known as Superman for his business acumen).
Mainland investors bought a net $1.08 billion worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs, including Alibaba, which was a large net buy via Southbound Stock Connect. Mainland China had a good, but not great, day as technology and growth stocks also outperformed, though decliners outpaced advancers. Remember, stocks are reflective of consumer confidence. Real estate stocks were a rare underperformer in both markets, though remember there are very few stocks left in MSCI indices, which is why we’ve favored the bonds over the stocks. It is interesting that CATL fell by -0.76% as electric vehicles weren’t highly noted.
The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech gained 2.84% and 4.02%, respectively, on volume down 4.02% from Tuesday, which is 167% of the 1-year average; 428 stocks advanced, while 65 declined. Main Board short turnover decreased by -12.87% from Tuesday, which is 169% of the 1-year average, as 16% of turnover was short turnover (Hong Kong short turnover includes ETF short volume, which is driven by market makers’ ETF hedging). The growth factor and small capitalization stocks outperformed the value factor and large capitalization stocks. The top-performing sectors were Information Technology, +6.23%; Materials, +3.92%; and Communication Services, +2.99%. Meanwhile, the worst-performing sector was Real Estate, which fell 0.30%. The top-performing subsectors were industry conglomerates, semiconductors, and construction materials. Meanwhile, household appliances were the worst-performing subsector. Southbound Stock Connect volumes were light of late as Mainland investors bought a net $1.076 billion worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs, led by Alibaba, a large net buy; Tencent, a moderate net buy; Xiaomi, Ubtech Robotics, and Hua Hong Semiconductors, which were small net buys; SMIC and Meituan were small net sells.
Shanghai, Shenzhen, and the STAR Board gained 0.53%, 0.41%, and 0.29%, respectively, on volume up 4.12% from yesterday, which is 129% of the 1-year average; 2,180 stocks advanced, while 2,798 declined. The value factor and large capitalization stocks outperformed the growth factor and small capitalization stocks. The top-performing sectors were communication services, +1.40%; financials, +1.31%; and consumer discretionary, +1.09%. Meanwhile, the worst-performing sectors were real estate, which fell 1.07%; health care, which fell 0.52%; and consumer staples, which did an inverse James Bond to close down by 0.07%. The top-performing subsectors were construction machinery, internet, and telecommunication, while leisure products, petrochemicals, and real estate were the worst.

When it comes to noteworthy TV brands, Sony has been one of the most popular companies on the market for several decades. Unfortunately, premium picture and sound quality often mean higher prices, especially when we’re talking about Sony. But that doesn’t mean you won’t find great sales on Sony screens now and then. As luck would have it, we came across this awesome promo earlier today:
For a limited time, when you purchase the Sony 65-inch Bravia 9 4K QLED at Amazon, Best Buy, Sony, and a handful of other retailers, you’ll only end up paying  $2,800. The full MSRP on this model is $3,000. We tested this TV back in August, and reviewer Caleb Denison said the Sony Bravia 9 “[Is] the best combination of OLED and mini-LED TV picture quality we’ve seen yet.”



Mini-LED technology is the name of the game with the almighty Sony Bravia 9. The manufacturer claims this QLED has some of the smallest LEDs on the market, allowing the TV to dial in some of the most accurate local dimming we’ve ever seen on an LCD panel.
Not only does this result in a nearly bloom-free picture when watching movies and shows in a dark room, but you’ll also be treated to astonishing SDR brightness levels, making the Bravia 9 an excellent choice for brightly lit rooms, too. And thanks to Sony’s experience in film and TV production, the Bravia 9 delivers a wide color gamut, terrific color volume, and top-shelf HDR performance.
Thanks to HDMI 2.1 connectivity on ports 3 and 4, along with VRR and ALLM support, the Bravia 9 is a great TV for gaming, especially if you’re a PlayStation devotee. Expect lightning-fast response times and low input lag when using the TV’s Game Mode.
When it comes to streaming apps, casting, and smart home management, the built-in Google TV OS is your all-in-one entertainment hub and Internet-of-Things command center.
Save $200 when you purchase the Sony 65-inch Bravia 9 4K QLED today, and be sure to take a look at our lists of the best Sony TV deals, best QLED TV deals, and best Amazon deals for even more discounts on top tech!



For the last few years, Amazon’s low-cost 4K LEDs have offered buyers a cost-effective means of achieving good picture quality and a ton of apps for less than the rest. And, as luck would have it, we came across an excellent promo on an Amazon set while vetting through Amazon deals: 
Right now when you purchase the Amazon 43-inch Fire TV 4-Series 4K LED you’ll only pay $210. The full MSRP on this model is $370, so that's a $160 discount. This is the lowest price this TV has ever dropped to, so you don't want to miss it.
Have you been looking for a unique take on an LED-LCD TV? While most of us don’t have the type of funds that LG’s Bendable screens warrant, what if we told you there was a family of TVs designed to showcase professional art prints and family photos, all the while doubling as an ultra-thin QLED that’s great for watching movies and playing video games? Enter Samsung’s The Frame, a 4K QLED lineup that’s getting the sales treatment this week:
Right now, every size of the 2024 Frame (LS03D) is on sale, including the massive 85-inch version. Order this monster of a TV at Best Buy, Samsung, and B&H Photo-Video (plus other retailers) while it’s marked down to $3,000 from $4,300!
Bells and whistles may be fun to use every once in a while, but sometimes you just need a TV that turns on and streams Netflix. Fortunately, pretty much every TV is a smart TV these days, and if you’re trying to save money on a new set, allow us to point you toward this fantastic offer from our pals at Best Buy: 
Right now, when you purchase the Insignia 50-inch F30 Series 4K LED at Best Buy or Amazon, you’ll only pay $210. The full MSRP on this model is $300.

76,2025-03-05,"Amgen (AMGN-0.86%) is getting closer to challenging the weight-loss drug duopoly of Novo Nordisk (NVO-2.46%), the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, and Eli Lilly (LLY+2.04%), which produces Zepbound.
The pharma company announced today that it has begun two late-stage clinical trials for its experimental weight-loss drug, MariTide. If successful, MariTide could disrupt the market by offering a less frequent dosing regimen than the current weekly injections on the market. The drug has been tested as a once-monthly treatment, as well as with dosing intervals of every other month and once every three months.
Amgen’s executive vice president of research and development, Jay Bradner, shared key details of the new trials Wednesday morning at TD Cowen’s annual healthcare conference.
The two trials will enroll about 4,500 patients in total. One study will recruit 3,500 participants that are obese or overweight, while the other will include 999 people who are both obese or overweight and have type 2 diabetes.
The primary objective of both studies is to assess the percentage of weight loss at 72 weeks. Amgen will test three dose levels — low, medium, and high — starting patients at a lower dose and gradually increasing it to the target doses. According to ClinicalTrials.gov, the studies are set to begin officially on March 17 and are expected to conclude in early 2027.
 In November, the company reported that MariTide helped patients with obesity or excess weight shed an average of 20% of their body weight in an earlier 52-week trial. For comparison, the highest dose of Wegovy resulted in an average weight loss of 15% after 68 weeks in clinical trials. Meanwhile, patients taking the highest dose of Eli Lilly’s  rival drug, Zepbound, achieved over 20% weight loss after 72 weeks.

Market timing
In 2007, Man Group set up a unique joint venture with Oxford University, the Oxford-Man Institute. Since then, our campus in Oxford has flourished, now comprising dozens of researchers under the tutelage of Professor Alvaro Cartea. These researchers have historically worked on some of the most pressing and complex questions faced by the investment industry; Man Group has benefitted enormously from their insights and deep research.
More recently, we have, under the banner of our Advisory engagements, been opening up the benefits of our academic research to our key clients and partners. We recognize that our largest investors, who tend to be sophisticated long-term allocators, wrestle with a variety of complex questions - from how to manage a world of increasing policy and geopolitical volatility to more specific questions like how to hedge FX risk or manage tail dependencies.
Engaging with allocators also makes us and our research teams smarter. Just this week, we have published an in-depth paper on one of the most heated subjects in financial academia - market timing. The academic corpus treats market timing like a kind of mirage - achievable in theory but not in practice. We collaborated with one of the smartest allocators we know - Jonas Thulin, CIO of AP3, the Swedish national pension fund - and a group of academics led by Alvaro Cartea and our old friend and collaborator Campbell Harvey. The results were fascinating.
Ask most financial academics about market timing, and you will receive the same response: don’t bother. The dominant school of thought, rooted in the work of William Sharpe (1975) and reinforced by decades of subsequent research, suggests that successful market timing requires an implausibly high degree of forecasting accuracy - at least 70% correctness in directional calls - to justify shifting allocations. Sharpe’s analysis concluded that few, if any, managers could achieve this standard, leading to the widely accepted notion that attempting to time markets is an exercise in futility.
Much of the skepticism around market timing comes from studies that focus on average outcomes across large samples of investors. This aggregation masks the skill differentials between the best and worst performers. Just because the average manager fails at market timing does not mean that all managers do. This is a critical flaw in how the topic has been studied: skill is not evenly distributed, and the best investors do not rely on crude market timing methods. They do not make binary in-or-out bets on the market but instead use sophisticated, multi-dimensional approaches to managing exposure dynamically.
The skepticism is perhaps easy to understand. Markets do not move in a predictable fashion – drawdowns when they come are both sharp and jagged, while even bull markets contain significant volatility. Anticipating the distribution of returns is at face value a steep task, as the chart below, showing bull and bear markets over the past century, makes clear.
100 Years of Bulls and Bears
The flipside of this is that, should you get timing right, the potential rewards are extraordinary. The chart below is hugely simplistic, but it makes a powerful case. Avoiding days in which US stocks suffer drawdowns of more than 5% has an astonishing impact on returns.
Miss the down days and your returns skyrocket
Our study challenges the conventional wisdom by taking a more granular approach to market timing - one that recognizes that financial markets are complex, adaptive systems, and that timing skill, where it exists, is not evenly distributed. By looking at daily, rather than monthly or quarterly data, and by separating top-quartile performers from the rest, we found strong evidence that market timing is not only possible but a significant driver of returns for the most skilled managers.
Across Man Group’s discretionary managers, market timing-related decisions have been a positive contributor to performance in nine of the past ten years. More importantly, certain managers exhibit a repeatable ability to time markets, particularly in how they adjust exposures based on shifting macroeconomic conditions, volatility dynamics, and sentiment shifts. The data suggests that market timing is not a futile exercise but a skill - one that, like any other, is unevenly distributed and requires both technological sophistication and human insight to exploit effectively.
One of the biggest misunderstandings about market timing is that it is purely about mispricing - that is, trying to predict when assets are over- or undervalued relative to their intrinsic worth. While valuation plays a role, timing markets is just as much about managing risk. Markets move not only because of changes in fundamental value but also because of shifts in the broader risk environment.
Financial markets oscillate between periods of stability and stress, with changes in volatility, liquidity, and correlations occurring in sometimes rapid and nonlinear ways. A successful market timer is not simply looking for “cheap” or “expensive” assets but is constantly assessing whether risk regimes are changing.
Predictability in markets, therefore, arises not just from mispricing but from the persistence of certain risk dynamics. For instance, volatility tends to cluster - long periods of calm often precede sharp spikes. Managers who can anticipate these inflection points, using tools like volatility term structures, macroeconomic stress indicators, and behavioral sentiment signals, can dynamically adjust exposures, reducing risk when necessary and increasing it when conditions improve.
The common critique of market timing assumes that it is an exercise in picking tops and bottoms. In reality, sophisticated market timers do something far more subtle. They integrate multiple layers of information - macroeconomic indicators, risk signals, liquidity measures, and sentiment factors - into models that help them assess the probability of different market outcomes.
Our study highlights four key types of signals that successful market timers use:
The best market timers do not rely on a single type of signal. Instead, they combine these insights dynamically, adjusting their models as market conditions evolve. A static model - a fixed set of indicators applied rigidly - will quickly become obsolete. A successful approach to market timing is fluid, adapting as markets change.
Market timing has long been dismissed as impractical, but our research suggests that this verdict deserves to be re-examined. The past two decades have seen profound structural changes in financial markets - the rise of passive investing, the increasing role of central banks in markets, and the explosion of data and machine learning in investment decision-making.
Ironically, these very developments may be making markets less efficient in certain ways. The dominance of passive flows means that price discovery is increasingly driven by fewer active participants. At the same time, behavioral-driven retail trading - fueled by commission-free platforms and social media - has created new distortions in asset pricing. These conditions create opportunities for skilled managers who can navigate them effectively.
If we accept that financial markets are adaptive rather than static, it follows that approaches to market timing must evolve alongside them. The challenge is not whether market timing is possible in some absolute sense, but how it can be practiced in a way that reflects the true complexity of modern markets.
The findings of our study reflect what we believe is a deeper truth about market timing: it is not the domain of lone forecasters making grand predictions, but of collaborative intelligence. Our work with Jonas Thulin and our academic partners reinforces the idea that the best investment insights emerge from combining multiple perspectives - quantitative research, macroeconomic intuition, and hands-on market experience. It harnesses the wisdom of the wise crowd.
If market timing is to be taken seriously, it requires both rigorous academic inquiry and real-world application. The conversation about market timing has been dominated for too long by a binary debate - is it possible or not? The reality is more interesting: market timing is not easy, but for those willing to engage with its complexity, it is a tool that can transform portfolio management."

Notes: This CoreLogic House Price Index report is for January.  The recent Case-Shiller index release was for December.  The CoreLogic HPI is a three-month weighted average and is not seasonally adjusted (NSA).

From CoreLogic: CoreLogic: Home Price Growth Largely Flat in January
U.S. home price growth in January 2025 was largely flat at 3.3% year over year. Although prices are expected to eek out gains in the coming year, with our economists predicting a 3.6% increase from January 2025 to January 2026, there are stark differences between regions.

The Northeast continues to buck overall national trends, remaining unbothered by slower job growth, elevated interest rates, and ongoing affordability concerns. Meanwhile, in the Mountain West, prices are the furthest from their record highs. In Hawaii, prices declined by 4.4%.
 
Despite this, national single-family home prices are forecast to reach a new peak in March 2025. Currently, the median sales price for all single-family homes in the U.S. is $375,000.

“Flattening home price changes over the last six months suggest further price deceleration is ahead,” said Dr. Selma Hepp, CoreLogic Chief Economist. “More importantly, compressed monthly changes highlight the general lack of home-buying demand that continues to characterize the current housing market. While this year's cold winter and large natural disasters play a role in dampening demand, falling consumer sentiment suggests potential homebuyers are wary of the short-term economic outlook and future inflation. Nevertheless, with the spring home buying season upon us, the recent improvements in mortgage rates may help invite homebuyers back into the market.”
emphasis added
This was the smaller YoY increase as reported for December.

This map is from the report.

• CoreLogic analysis suggests that Florida markets are continuing to fall out of favor while western New York is gaining popularity.

• Our economists anticipate further price deceleration in 2025, although recent improvements in mortgage rates may spur homebuying this spring.

• National home price growth is flat on a monthly basis. Annual home price growth is tracking just above inflation.

• Florida and Arizona top the charts for markets where the risk of price decline is very high.

81,2025-03-05,"The tech billionaire has been leading DOGE's effort to slash federal spending.
Billionaire Elon Musk's political action committee, America PAC, has placed its first-ever nationwide TV ad, a $1 million ad buy that touts President Donald Trump's first few weeks in office following Tuesday's joint address to Congress, a source familiar with the matter told ABC News.
The 60-second ad will run this week in the Washington, D.C., media market and across the country, the source told ABC News.
The ad begins by attacking former President Joe Biden, showing clips of him stumbling on the stairs while boarding Air Force One. A voiceover says, ""After four long years of humiliation, of failure at home and embarrassment abroad, our long national nightmare is finally over.""
The ad then echoes some of what Trump highlighted in his joint address, saying the president has ""delivered the lowest level of illegal immigration in history.""
Musk, who spent roughly $250 million supporting Trump during the 2024 election, has been leading the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency's massive effort to slash federal spending by cutting government programs, laying off federal workers, selling off government buildings and attempting to close down numerous federal agencies.
Critics say Musk is carrying out his cuts without congressional authority, that his efforts are politically motivated, that DOGE is not being transparent about its work, and that it has unnecessarily accessed sensitive government data.
The America PAC ad does not mention DOGE or Musk by name, but it appears to allude to their work, saying of Trump, ""He's draining the swamp, slashing billions in waste at home, while closing the spigot of American tax dollars to foreign regimes.""

83,2025-03-05,"This is the fourth entry in a multipart series. You may be interested to read about Shockley Semiconductor, Fairchild Semiconductor, the start of Intel, and the rise of the 8086.
At the start of the 1980s, Intel was in the absolute best position possible for a microprocessor manufacturer. They’d won IBM’s business with 8088, and they had around another 5000 customers for the 8086/8088. While the company was undoubtedly enjoying this success, they did have one failure. At the end of 1981, the company released what they’d intended to be the future of the microprocessor business, the iAPX 432. This was the first attempt to implement object orientation in silicon, was Intel’s first attempt at a 32bit CPU, and Intel did far more than just those two things. The 432 additionally moved process scheduling, interprocess communication, garbage collection, and storage allocation into hardware. At the hardware level, the CPU (here called the General Data Processor, or GDP) was built of two 64-pin VLSI chips. There was a third chip, the Interface Processor, which handled communication and data transfer for I/O. This Interface Processor connected the GDP to the Intel Multibus, and there could be multiple of these busses each controlled by an Intel 8086. That 8086 connected to memory and some I/O devices. This setup meant that all input and output was actually being handled by the 8086 that in this context was called an Attached Processor.
 At the software level, the initial design for the 432 had it using ALGOL 68 as its assembly language, but by the time of release this had been changed to Ada. The 432 supported two types of instructions, scalar and object. The scalar instructions included move and store operators, boolean, binary and floating point arithmetic, and comparators. All scalar instructions operated on 8bit characters, 16bit and 32bit integers (signed or unsigned), and 32bit, 64bit, and 80bit floats. The architecture was stack based with operands fetched from the stack and results pushed back, and it lacked general purpose registers.
In this design, ALL system resources were represented as objects. So, for example, the state of the GDPs and IPs in a 432 system were represented by processor objects. These processor objects then had a series of child objects that that were representations of processes to be executed. The addressing of objects was then handled via access descriptors, or ADs. There were objects for scope, type, storage, ports, and even instructions.
If this is all sounding complicated and over-engineered, that’s because it is, and when looking at the block diagrams in Intel’s patents around the 432, things get far more complicated. All of this immense complexity resulted in a system that was around a quarter of the speed of the 8086 in general use. As for why the performance was so abysmal, one account providing a plausible explanation stated it was the switch to Ada. This happened so late in development, that the compiler team had little time to develop tooling, and the software team had even less time to develop the iMAX 432 operating system. All of this resulted in many common operations requiring more than a hundred cycles. Given poor performance and the cost of an Ada compiler being more than car at the time, there was essentially no market for the 432, and Intel wasted around $100 million. Of course, the side effect was that the world got the 8086.
With a major win and a major loss, Intel marched into 1982 as the the largest manufacturer of metal oxide semiconductor ICs on Earth. The company had facilities in the San Francisco Bay area, Portland, Phoenix, Austin, Albuquerque, Puerto Rico, Malaysia, Philippines, Japan, Barbados, Israel, Belgium, and the UK. Intel’s sales offices could be found in 27 countries. The 2164A DRAM of 64K started volume production in 1982, and Intel released the 27128 EPROM that provided 128K, the Intel Personal Development System, the 8096 microcontroller, the 80150 (CP/M on a chip), and the Intel 80186/80188.
The 80186 was was a 16bit microprocessor with a 20bit address bus. Like the 8086 and 8088, the 80188 was the roughly the same CPU as the 80186 but with an 8bit data bus. The initial chips were clocked at 6MHz and compared to an 8086 at the same speed, the 80186 was slightly faster due to microcode improvements. The instruction set for the 80186 was slightly expanded over that of its predecessor, and those extensions were found in later x86 chips as well as the NEC x86 chips. Unlike the 8086, the 80186 integrated the clock generator, interrupt controller, timers, wait state generator, and a few other components. It did not, however, include memory. So, for those wishing to use the 80186 as a microcontroller, they’d still require a ROM and RAM.
Work on the Intel 80286 (or iAPX 286) had started in 1978, and the CPU was brought to the world on the 1st of February in 1982. This was a 16bit CPU with 24bit addressing allowing it to support up to 16MB of RAM. The first of these to come out of Intel could be found at clocks of 5MHz, 6MHz, or 8MHz. Later models could be clocked up to 25MHz. The 80286 was built of 120,000 transistors (later models used 134,000 transistors) on a 1.5 micron HMOS process. It came in a 68-pin PGA, but other packaging options were available. Depending upon the clock rate, the processor could achieve from around 900,000 instructions per second to up to 2.66 million instructions per second. In most cases, the 80286 was roughly double the performance of the 8086 at the same clock. The chip included the new instructions from the 80186, but it added more for its new protected virtual address mode. The protected-mode was meant to enable the use of advanced multitasking and multiuser operating systems, and thus provide Intel entry into the server and workstation markets. For this, the chip provided different segments for data, code, and stack and prevented the overlapping of these segments. Each segment then had a privilege level assigned to it where a segment of a lower privilege level cannot access segments of a higher privilege level. These advancements were not commonly used by most who owned a 286, as the chip couldn’t switch back to real-mode from protected-mode efficiently. The most common way this switch was completed on a 286 was the method employed by IBM’s OS/2: triple fault the CPU, trigger a shutdown cycle, have the motherboard reset the CPU, and have BIOS skip post and jump to a specified memory address immediately following the return of CPU execution. This was slow, and OS/2 didn’t launch to the public until December of 1987 by which time, Intel had shipped 5 million 286 CPUs. This was sped up in later models with microcode changes (hence the later increase in transistor count) made by Intel while working with Digital Research. This is Intel, so the 80286 was accompanied by a suite of support chips, but unlike the company’s prior CPUs, the 286 had an integrated memory controller. Beyond OS/2 already mentioned, the 286 saw ports of Concurrent DOS, Windows, XENIX, Coherent, and Minix. The majority of 286 owners, of course, would have been running PC-DOS or MS-DOS.
Intel closed 1982 with $30,046,000 in income on $899,812,000 in revenues. As seen nearly every single year of Intel’s life up to this point, the company had been heavily investing in expansion. Intel’s rapid growth meant that the company could outproduce their competitors, and this brought them a 72% market share in the 16bit microprocessor market in 1983.
In 1983, the company released new microcontrollers, the 186 and 286 were in volume production, more than 60 new microcomputers were released featuring the 8086/8088, and while the company was no longer the king of the memory market, they were still strong. The company released a 256K EPROM, a 4K NVRAM, and the Intellec Series IV development computers. Intel crossed the billion dollar mark closing the year with revenues of $1,121,943,000 yielding income of $116,111,000.
In 1984, Intel dramatically increased their R&D spend to $180 million (about 11% of revenues), they introduced 70 new products, tripled CPU production every quarter, and introduced a new CHMOS process. Among those new products were CHMOS DRAMs, EPROMs, network controllers, the MULTIBUS II specification, and the BITBUS serial communication specification for industrial applications. Revenues for 1984 were $1,629,332,000 with income of $198,189,000.
In the year 1985, the semiconductor industry suffered from oversupply and decreased demand. Across the industry, companies had been racing to produce more as no matter how much they sold, people kept desiring more. That condition changed, and memory prices fell sharply. In a reaction to that state of affairs, President and COO Andy Grove and Chairman and CEO Gordon Moore announced that Intel was leaving the memory business. Their one remaining investment in that industry was EPROMs. From this point forward, the primary market for Intel was microprocessors. Within that industry, the company would produce CPUs, peripheral chips, microcontrollers that combined CPUs and peripheral chips into one, and development systems that provided the software market with systems to target Intel’s products. Internally, the company then began to emphasize increasing their yields, reducing per unit cost, providing their customers with reliable and on-time delivery, and leading the market in CPU architecture.
The first CPU from the now decidedly CPU-oriented company was the Intel 80386 (or i386) in mid-October. The development of the 386 had begun as soon as the 80286 had been completed, and that development cycle cost the company nearly as much as the iAPX 432 had. The architecture of the 386 was led by John Crawford, but he didn’t work alone. The 386 team included Jan Prak, Jim Slager, Gene Hill, Chris Krauskopf, Jill Leukhardt, Pat Gelsinger, Greg Blanck, and many more. There were some folks like Les Kohn who, while never assigned to the project, contributed greatly to the design and implementation. This was the first time that Intel made extensive use of automated system design, simulation, CAD, and UNIX tools in the design of a CPU, and it was the first large scale use of CMOS. In all of this, Gelsinger became more important than he might have otherwise as he was Intel’s resident UNIX expert. His role grew overtime in the project, and he led the tapeout team.
The Intel 80386 was built, at launch, of 275,000 transistors on 1.5 micron CHMOS III process, and clocked at 16MHz, it could achieve performance of around 4 million instructions per second. It was shipped in a 132-pin PGA with more packaging options available depending upon the application. Later models could be clocked from 12.5MHz up to 40MHz, were made on a 1 micron CHMOS IV process, and could have up to 855,000 transistors on chip (SL variant). The 386 was a 32bit processor with a 6 stage instruction pipeline, on-chip MMU, and offered real-mode, protected-mode, and virtual-mode. In protected-mode, the 386 could address 4GB of RAM. If segmentation were used with protected-mode, the 386 could address up to 64TB of virtual memory. A key advantage of the 386 was that to any program (and programmer) the 386 would behave as if it had a flat memory model while in protected-mode despite the hardware using segmentation. The 386 also once again extended the x86 instruction set, added new registers, and greatly improved backward compatibility. With the 386, the machine could make use of virtual-mode, that is virtual 8086 mode, to run multiple real-mode (usually MS-DOS) programs simultaneously. This processor also introduced a name change. Rather than have a 386 and a 388, Intel opted to refer to the fully 32bit part as the 386DX. A 386 with a 16bit data bus was a 386SX. Another major distinction between the two variants was that the 386SX only had 24 pins connected on the address bus which limited RAM to just 16MB. In practice, most home users at the time wouldn’t even have had 16MB of RAM. The 386 saw tremendous operating system support with Windows, NT, OS/2, Linux, BSD, XENIX, PC-MOS/386, Coherent, LynxOS, BeOS, Integrity, and NetWare. Aside from early 386 workstations, however, most owners of a 386 would still have been running MS-DOS or Windows.
The 386 is easily among the most important CPUs ever made. While it may not have been as powerful as some rivals, it was the chip that allowed commodity microcomputers to really contend with workstations and minicomputers at a far lower price. This was also the enabler of Compaq’s breaking of IBM’s stranglehold on the PC platform, and it allowed Windows to become a default choice for PC-compatibles.
Intel closed 1985 with $1,364,982,000 in revenues and income of $1,570,000. While I am certain that this sharp drop in profit worried many, Intel’s future was brighter than ever. The company had their development systems ready for the 386, and many vendors had already either developed system designs around the 386 or had committed to do so.

84,2025-03-05,"U.S. stock futures climbed early Wednesday—after dropping to their lowest levels since before the November election on the previous day—as Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick signaled President Donald Trump was open to a deal that would roll back some of the tariffs imposed on neighbors Canada and Mexico.
Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick signaled that President Donald Trump may be open to making a deal ... [+] with Canada and Mexico on the tariffs issue.
The benchmark S&P 500 index futures were up around 0.56% to 5,821 points in pre-market trading early on Wednesday morning, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq futures rose around 0.7% to 20,542 points—a day after closing at their lowest level since election day.
Dow futures—which closed at its lowest level since mid-January on Tuesday—also rose more than 0.52% to 42,817 points in early trading.
The pre-market bump came after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick’s appearance on Fox Business on Tuesday evening, where he appeared to signal that the Trump administration was flexible on tariffs imposed against Canada and Mexico.
In the interview, Lutnick claimed both Canadian and Mexican officials were “on the phone with me all day today trying to show that they'll do better,” in dealing with Trump’s complaints about tackling cross-border flows of fentanyl and other opioid drugs into the U.S.
The commerce secretary then said Trump was listening to this “because, you know, he’s very, very fair and very reasonable,” and suggested the president was going to “work something out with them.”

Without offering details, the commerce secretary said, “So I think he's [Trump] going to work something out with them.” Lutnick noted that this does not mean the tariffs would be paused, but rather if both countries agree to “do more,” Trump will meet them “in the middle somewhere.” Lutnick signaled that this compromise could involve the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement—which the previous Trump administration signed with Canada and Mexico—saying: “The president is considering giving you relief, if you live under those rules. And if you haven't lived under those rules, well, then you have got to pay the tariff.” The commerce secretary added that an announcement on this matter would probably come on Wednesday.
Mexican officials have not yet publicly commented on Lutnick’s remarks. Canada’s Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly was asked about it in a BBC interview and said: “We know when it comes to the different secretaries of the Trump administration, they can say many things, but at the end of the day, the only one that really takes a decision is President Trump.” Joly then said many of Trump’s staffers can be “talking to us and having different types of conversations, but even they don’t really know what the president wants.” She added no one from the Trump administration contacted either the Canadian government or the Mexican government on Monday “regarding the Tariff issue.”
Lunick’s interview aired shortly before Trump delivered an address to Congress where he strongly defended his use of tariffs. The president told Congress that the likes of “the European Union, China, Brazil, India, Mexico and Canada,” have used “tariffs against us for decades, and now it’s our turn to start using them.” Trump then added: “They’re about protecting the soul of our country. Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again.”

85,2025-03-05,"Stagflation may be set for its first real return to the U.S. in about 50 years, as recent economic numbers point to a slowing labor market and continued stickiness in inflation. President Donald Trump’s new tariffs won’t help.
This risks creating a very difficult environment for consumers. Unemployment may increase and wage gains may slow, even as the cost of living goes up. Getting a new mortgage or car loan would also get more expensive.
Here’s what to know about stagflation.
Stagflation is when the economy slows or contracts, joblessness rises but prices go right on rising. It’s a problem that first came to prominence in the 1970s, and it remains a challenge for government officials — and especially central banks — because the usual policy toolkit doesn’t work well. 
Usually, inflation is caused when  demand for goods and services grows more quickly than supply. The policy response is normally to slow the economy, which since the 1980s has meant hiking interest rates. Under stagflation, higher interests costs may cool price gains, but can also trigger or worsen a recession.
The causes of stagflation aren’t entirely clear. In the 1970s, OPEC put an oil embargo on many Western countries over their support for Israel during the Yom Kippur War. This created a structural price shock that resonated through the economy that wasn’t effectively addressed by government of the day.
Two trends in the current economy point to this problem: Jobs data that’s weakened and missed economists estimates, and inflation that’s picked up and come in hotter than predicted.
January consumer inflation came in hot. Employers added far fewer jobs in February than in January, unemployment claims were worse than expected, and the staffing measure in the ISM manufacturing survey also showed a big jump in prices paid. On March 7, payroll numbers for February will add another data point — and some economists also expect a big miss.
And the Atlanta fed is now projecting a 2.8% contraction in the U.S. economy this quarter — an outlier given most analysts are still projecting growth, but a troubling sign of potential trouble.
During the 1970s stagflation, both stocks and bonds suffered. The benchmark S&P 500 plunged 48% between January 1973 to December 1974, and didn’t fully recover until the 1980s as profit growth lagged. Bonds also fell because their regular, fixed payments to investors were eroded by inflation.
Investments to cope with stagflation include inflation-protected investments like the U.S. government’s TIP bonds and upstream natural resource companies, Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at Northern Trust Wealth Management (NTRS+1.30%), told Kiplinger’s last year.
There’s no clear consensus on why stagflation ended and which government actions were actually effective in addressing the problem — many assessments track the ideological biases of the commentators.
While economic  growth did rebound in the late 1970s, price gains remained faster than average until the so-called Volcker shock of 1979-1981, when the Fed gradually raised its key rate to as high as 19.1% in June 1981. This boosted the unemployment to a peak of 10.8%, but did bring CPI down to as low as 2.5%.
One reason a full repeat of 1970s stagflation isn’t likely in the U.S.: The country no longer has a strong labor movement. Unions were then strong enough to demand pay increases that matched inflation. Companies would boost their prices to cover the increased costs, creating a so-called wage-price spiral.

86,2025-03-05,"Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg had a cheeky take on Donald Trump’s speech to a joint session of Congress.
“We won the popular vote by big numbers and won counties in our country 2,700 to 525—on a map that reads almost completely red for Republican,” Trump told both chambers Tuesday night, using his win to claim that he had been given a “mandate” by the country to radically reimagine the federal government.
But the former South Bend mayor couldn’t help himself from adding a dash of spice to Trump’s reminder, offering to The Late Show With Stephen Colbert that the president may have won, but only by a historically tiny margin.
“Despite what you heard tonight, he came in with just under 50 percent of the vote,” Buttigieg said. “He won, I’m not disputing that. But it was the smallest popular vote margin since Nixon.
“I wonder how he feels about something that important being that small in his case,” Buttigieg mused with a smirk. “And he has lost support from there.”
“To be smaller than Tricky Dick is, uh—gives one pause, I would say,” Colbert quipped back.
Holy shit! Pete Buttigieg was on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, and man, does he know how to get under Donald Trump's skin...Man, oh man... 🤣 pic.twitter.com/ek66RjDLXH
A CNN Poll released this week found that just 39 percent of Americans felt the country was moving in the right direction, as opposed to 45 percent who believed it was moving in the wrong direction. 
Even Republicans don’t seem to believe in the “mandate” decree coming from the White House. In Tennessee over the weekend, an angry town hall before Representative Diana Harshbarger screamed, “No!” when the Republican lawmaker asked if there had been a “mandate to the president from the American people,” who she claimed “overwhelmingly” voted Trump in.
“We’re giving the billionaires tax cuts!” a man shouted at Harshbarger.
Donald Trump is already backing off some of his tariffs only one day after they went into effect.
On Wednesday, the Trump administration granted a one-month exception to U.S. automobile companies from the 25 percent tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada. The change came after the president spoke with CEOs of the Big Three automakers: Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis. Trump reportedly told the auto executives that they should move their production to the United States, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.
“We spoke with the Big Three auto dealers,” Trump said in a statement read by Leavitt. “We are going to give a one-month exemption on any autos coming through USMCA,” he added, referring to the free trade agreement between Mexico, the U.S., and Canada. Leavitt told reporters that Trump is open to additional exemptions, although none are planned at this time.
Trump imposed tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China on Tuesday, prompting the stock market to plummet and Mexican, Canadian, and Chinese leaders to announce retaliatory tariffs. The premier of Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, told the Associated Press that the auto industry in Canada and the U.S. could only last 10 days before assembly lines would start to shut down.
“People are going to lose their jobs,” Doug Ford said. 
The exemption follows remarks by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick Wednesday morning on Bloomberg Television that Trump would update his tariff plans later in the day.
“There are going to be tariffs, let’s be clear,” Lutnick said. “But what he’s thinking about is which sections of the market that can maybe—maybe—he’ll consider giving them relief until we get to, of course, April 2.”
Trump’s tariffs are expected to raise the prices of numerous goods in the U.S. aside from automobiles, including groceries, electronics, and farm equipment. They also will cause negative ripple effects for the American public, including higher utility bills, partly due to Ford’s threats to cut off electricity to the United States.
It remains to be seen if there will be more carve-outs for Trump’s tariffs, although a rapidly worsening economy could force the president’s hand. What Trump’s endgame is for his very unwise economic plans is not clear, but in the meantime, the American taxpayer will bear the brunt of his folly. 
In just a handful of weeks, Donald Trump’s nationalist policies and aggressive tariffs have rattled Canada’s economy, the American stock market, and, with it, the two nations’ long-standing alliance.
But Trump’s most recent approach to negotiating with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau amid the spontaneous trade war has taken a hard turn, more closely resembling catty high school gossip than legitimate foreign policy.
“Justin Trudeau, of Canada, called me to ask what could be done about Tariffs,” Trump posted on Truth Social Wednesday. “I told him that many people have died from Fentanyl that came through the Borders of Canada and Mexico, and nothing has convinced me that it has stopped.” 
“He said that it’s gotten better, but I said, ‘That’s not good enough.’ The call ended in a ‘somewhat’ friendly manner!” Trump continued. “He was unable to tell me when the Canadian Election is taking place, which made me curious, like, what’s going on here? I then realized he is trying to use this issue to stay in power. Good luck Justin!”
That lackadaisical response came on the heels of a harrowing address given Tuesday by Trudeau, in which the Canadian leader accused Trump of attempting to undermine Canada’s economy in order to “annex” it as America’s fifty-first state. He also urged Americans to look in the mirror and consider if they’re comfortable tossing the nation’s strongest Western alliances to effectively become Russia’s puppet.
Trump “feels strongly that it would be very beneficial for the Canadian people to be the fifty-first state of the United States. They wouldn’t be paying for these tariffs, and they’d have much lower taxes if they became a part of our great country,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Wednesday.
The president’s controversial tariffs went into effect first thing Tuesday, imposing 25 percent levies on Canada and Mexico as well as a 10 percent tariff hike on Chinese goods. In return, Canada and China slapped the U.S. with equal tariffs, while Mexico promised to do the same, with further details to come Sunday. Meanwhile, the spontaneously unpaused levies immediately followed reports that Trump had directed administration officials to draft a proposal that would lift sanctions on Russia. 
“I can tell you that every country is very, very aware that if the American government is willing to do this to their own closest ally, neighbor, and friend,” Trudeau said Tuesday. “Then everyone is vulnerable to a trade war.”
Less than a day after the tariffs went into effect, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox Business that they could be undone as soon as Thursday.
“Both the Canadians and Mexicans were on the phone with me all day today trying to show that they’ll do better,” Lutnick told the network, with regard to fentanyl flows into the U.S. “So I think [Trump] is going to work something out with them.”
The Department of Government Efficiency’s slashing of the federal workforce is disproportionately hurting veterans, and the damage is only going to get worse.
According to a March 4 memo first obtained by Government Executive, the Department of Veterans Affairs is planning to lay off as many as 83,000 employees. The Trump administration wants the department to get its workforce back to 2019 levels, when the VA employed 399,957 people and before millions of veterans became eligible for greater care. More than one in four VA employees are veterans.
The “aggressive” cuts will “resize and tailor the workforce to the mission and revised structure,” VA chief of staff Christopher Syrek wrote in the memo, which was sent to employees on Tuesday.
The department is expected to deliver its plans to “increase workforce efficiency” to the Office of Personnel Management by April 14.
Employment at the VA increased significantly under Biden with the passing of the 2022 PACT Act, which expanded health care benefits for veterans exposed to toxins and was the result of years’ worth of advocacy from various veteran organizations.
DOGE couldn’t care less. The pseudo-agency’s plan to fire 17 percent of the VA’s workforce is just the latest move in its assault on veterans and, more broadly, the federal government. Last month, DOGE laid off 2,400 VA employees and more than 6,000 veterans from other federal agencies.
DOGE also sought to terminate 875 affected contracts at the VA, which would significantly harm veterans’ access to health care services. The cuts have been temporarily suspended, but will likely resurface. 
Florida’s attorney general has launched an “active criminal investigation” into manosphere bigot Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan, who arrived in the country just last week at Donald Trump’s behest. 
The brothers returned to the U.S. from Romania, where they still face rape and human trafficking charges, after the Trump administration sought the return of their passports, opposing a court order requiring them to remain in the European nation while the investigation continued.
Now that the dual British-American citizens have returned stateside, they’ve found themselves the subject of yet another criminal investigation for alleged sex crimes.
“These guys have themselves publicly admitted to participating in what very much appears to be soliciting, trafficking, preying upon women around the world,” Attorney General James Uthmeier said Tuesday. 
“Many of these victims are coming forward, some of them minors—people can spin or defend however they want, but in Florida, this type of behavior is viewed as atrocious. We’re not going to accept it,” Uthmeier said. “They chose to come here and set their feet down in this state, and we’re going to pursue every tool we have within our legal authority to hold them accountable.”
Uthemeier announced the investigation in a post on X Tuesday, saying his office had conducted a “preliminary inquiry” into the brothers. “Based on a thorough review of the evidence, I’ve directed the Office of Statewide Prosecution to execute search warrants and issue subpoenas in the now-active criminal investigation into the Tate brothers,” he wrote.
Andrew Tate posted on X dozens of times between Tuesday and Wednesday, claiming his innocence and attacking Uthmeier and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who appointed the attorney general.
“This isn’t the America I know. This is a sad sad day for America,” Tate wrote in one post Tuesday, describing the investigation as “absolute communism.” 
Last week, Andrew Tate denied all wrongdoing. “We’ve no criminal record anywhere on the planet ever,” he said. 
That claim is still pending, however, as the brothers remain under investigation in Romania. Last year, a Romanian court ruled that after those court proceedings finished, the brothers could then be extradited to the U.K. to face additional charges of sex crimes. 
Andrew Tate, a former kickboxer and professional misogynist, is a central figure in the manosphere of contemptible internet chauvinists, a group of right-wing shills Trump utilized in his run for the presidency—and now intends to thank in kind. 
Elon Musk may be getting another handout from the federal government. 
The Wall Street Journal reports that the tech mogul’s satellite internet company, Starlink, could soon make up to $20 billion thanks to a Commerce Department overhaul of a Biden-era program to expand broadband internet access to rural areas. 
Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has told staff that he wants to make grants under the $42.5 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program “technology neutral,” which would give states the ability to allocate more funds to satellite internet providers like Starlink instead of companies using fiber-optic cable technology to connect rural areas.
Musk and Starlink could draw much more funding under the new rules. Under the program’s existing restrictions, states can only fund alternatives to fiber, such as satellite, in places where laying fiber cables isn’t cost-effective or feasible. Starlink was expected to haul in around $4.1 billion under the existing rules but could rake in anywhere from $10 billion to $20 billion if Lutnick’s changes are accepted. 
Those changes could be announced this week, albeit without many details, according to unnamed sources cited by the Journal. Implementing the overhaul could take longer, as some states may decide to change the allocation of funding they’ve already received. But Musk could easily grease the wheels or complicate matters if he devotes any X posts to the issue. 
The tech mogul and fascism enthusiast has benefited immensely from the Trump administration, only adding to his government-subsidized wealth as the world’s richest man. If these changes to rural broadband funding go through, not only will Musk get richer but his power in the federal government will increase and extend to rural America.  
Elon Musk told some of his biggest investors Wednesday that he’s looking to fully take over the federal government.
In a meeting with Morgan Stanley, the tech billionaire reportedly likened his influence over the federal government to a “corporate takeover.”
“To understand the federal government, it is like a corporate takeover at scale, but one where the company is actually in much worse shape than any commercial company could ever be,” Musk said at the conference, reported CNN’s Hadas Gold.
Musk then went on to say that “logically we should prioritize anything that can reasonably be privatized,” including public services such as the postal service and Amtrak.
Last month, officials with the United States Postal Service flagged that the Trump administration was looking to dissolve the organization’s governing board and place it under the control of the Commerce Department and Secretary Howard Lutnick. Experts believe doing so would likely violate federal law.
The USPS is practically as old as the country, and oversees the myriad shipping demands of the American public, supporting trillions of dollars in commerce.
It also “generally receives no tax dollars for operating expenses and relies on the sale of postage, products and services to fund its operations,” according to USPS’s website.
Still, that hasn’t prevented America’s public mail system from becoming a favorite target of the president. In 2020, Trump argued that the postal service should be dismantled to prevent voting by mail.
Meanwhile, Musk’s role in hacking and slashing federal spending has come under increased legal scrutiny, forcing the Trump administration to announce last week that it was Amy Gleason, a low-profile, first-term Trump official with experience in health care tech, rather than the high-profile billionaire who was leading the Department of Government Efficiency. Meanwhile, Musk has been officially titled a “senior adviser” to Trump. 
That title offers him “no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself,” the administration claimed, and leaves Musk with no formal responsibilities to run DOGE as either an employee or an administrator, but as a mere employee of the White House.
However, a Freudian slip by the president during his joint session address Tuesday confirmed what DOGE employees and Justice Department attorneys had seemed to understand: that DOGE is actually “headed up by Elon Musk.”
In early February, Morgan Stanley positioned itself to offload upward of $5.5 billion of its outstanding debt in X. Musk had tapped the bank to help him acquire the social media platform for $44 billion in 2022, but the investment has since lost the bulk of its value. In 2023, Musk admitted that the site had lost 90 percent of its value under his stewardship.
China is ready to fight back in Donald Trump’s trade war, or any war for that matter.
On Tuesday, Trump spurred global financial chaos by imposing 25 percent tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico, and doubling tariffs on Chinese goods from 10 to 20 percent.
“If war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war, or any other type of war, we’re ready to fight till the end,” the Chinese Embassy wrote, in a post on X, following the announcement.
Trump claims the tariffs will force China to stop the flow of fentanyl to the United States, but China has already retaliated with its own tariffs—kicking off a trade war guaranteed to hurt American consumers.
“Chinese officials have failed to take the actions necessary to stem the flow of precursor chemicals to known criminal cartels and shut down money laundering by transnational criminal organizations,” a fact sheet accompanying Trump’s tariff announcement reads.
Beijing immediately took retaliatory action against the United States, imposing 15 percent tariffs on U.S. agricultural imports. Canada too has imposed 25 percent retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports, joining China and Mexico in their hostility toward Trump.
A spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry, Lin Jian, condemned the president’s decision at a press conference Wednesday and urged the U.S. to “return to the right track of dialogue and cooperation.”
“If the U.S. truly wants to solve the fentanyl issue, then the right thing to do is to consult with China on the basis of equality, mutual respect, and mutual benefit to address each other’s concerns,” Jian said. “If the U.S. has other agenda in mind, and if harming China’s interests is what the U.S. wants, we’re ready to fight till the end.”
Democratic Representative Al Green’s protest during Donald Trump’s address to Congress Tuesday night went too far for his Republican colleagues, who are now calling for his censure. 
The far-right House Freedom Caucus posted on X Wednesday that it plans to introduce “a censure resolution against Rep. Al Green today.” Other Republicans not in the caucus, including Representatives Troy Nehls and Dan Newhouse, have also indicated that they plan to introduce a resolution to censure Green. 
The effort will likely have the support of House Speaker Mike Johnson, who said Tuesday night that Green’s actions were “absolutely shameful. He should be censured.”
“It’s a spectacle that was not necessary. He’s made history in a terrible way, and I hope he enjoys it,” Johnson told The Hill.
Green says he plans to accept the consequences, saying that he shouted at the president “because Medicaid is so important to my constituents.”  
“If I broke the rules, then I have to be prepared to suffer the consequences. You don’t break the rules and then demand that you be treated as though nothing ever happened,” the Houston-area congressman told Axios. 
Green’s fellow Democrats in the House are backing up their colleague, with a leading House member and a centrist from the party telling Axios that they don’t expect anyone from the party to vote for the censure. Green isn’t backing down either, having already said earlier this month that he plans to introduce articles of impeachment against Trump. 
“Let them bring their sanctions. Bring them on,” Green said. 
Greenland’s Prime Minister Múte Bourup Egede hit back at Donald Trump’s outlandish threat to acquire the Danish territory “one way or the other.”
In his address to Congress Tuesday night, Trump gave conflicting messages to the citizens of Greenland. While he claimed to “strongly support” Greenlanders’ “right to determine [their] own future,” and promised to keep them safe and make them rich, the president also restated that the United States would succeed in acquiring the territory. 
“We need it really for international world security. And I think we’re going to get it. One way or the other, we’re going to get it,” Trump said. 
The president said that his administration was “working with everybody involved to try to get it.”
Despite what Trump claimed Tuesday, it seems that neither the leaders of Greenland nor Denmark are actually playing ball with his wild imperialist threat. Egede shut down Trump’s comments in a post on Facebook Wednesday, written in Greenlandic and Danish.
“Kalaallit Nunaat is ours,” Egede wrote, using the Greenlandic term meaning “Land of the People,” or the “Land of the Greenlanders.”
“We don’t want to be Americans, nor Danes; we are Kalaallit. The Americans and their leader must understand that. We are not for sale and cannot simply be taken. Our future will be decided by us in Greenland,” Egede wrote in the post. 
Meanwhile, Denmark’s Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said that Trump’s reference to Greenlanders’ right to self determination was the most important part of the speech—especially with the parliamentary elections approaching next week. He stressed that it was important for the election to proceed “without any kind of international intervention.”
But Trump’s outrageous threats to acquire Greenland have become a hot-button issue on the island, and while his attempts at outreach have ranged from frivolous to ineffectual, his rhetoric about making the territory the “fifty-second state” has already electrified the independence movement there. 
Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen insisted that Greenland was not for sale in a television interview after Trump’s address. Last month, Trump made a startling phone call to Frederiksen and was reportedly “aggressive and confrontational,” threatening tariffs against the country unless it does exactly what he wants—flying in the face of his false promises about self-determination. 
Despite the fact that leadership hardly seems interested in handing over control of the mineral-rich territory to the U.S, that hasn’t stopped Republicans from letting their imaginations run away with them. Last month, Republican Representative Buddy Carter of Georgia filed a bill to rename Greenland “Red, White, and Blueland.”"
87,2025-03-05,"Boston Mayor Michelle Wu slammed Republican lawmakers for harming millions of Americans as she defended her city’s immigration policies at a House Oversight Committee hearing on sanctuary cities Wednesday.
In one particular exchange, Republican Representative Paul Gosar pressed Wu on federal immigration laws taking priority over local ones.
“Respectfully, Congressman, you could pass bipartisan legislation, and that would be comprehensive immigration law,” she replied.
“If you wanted to make us safe, pass gun reforms, stop cutting Medicaid, stop cutting cancer research, stop cutting funds for veterans. That is what will make our city safe,” she added as Gosar rolled his eyes.
She praised her city’s health care, low crime rates, higher education, and winning sports teams.
“We are the cradle of democracy and the city of champions. We are all of these things, not in spite of our immigrants but because of them,” Wu said.
The Boston mayor testified alongside the Democratic mayors of New York City, Denver, and Chicago, all of which are sanctuary cities, or jurisdictions with policies that limit information sharing with federal law enforcement to protect undocumented immigrants from deportation or prosecution. There are more than 600 sanctuary jurisdictions nationwide.
James Comer, the chair of the House Oversight Committee, and other Republicans, accused each city of putting its residents at risk and failing to comply with Donald Trump’s mass deportation plan. Comer is currently leading an investigation into sanctuary cities and their impact on federal immigration enforcement.
“Sanctuary cities make us all less safe and are a public safety nightmare,” Comer said at the hearing. “We cannot let pro-criminal alien policies of obstructionist sanctuary cities continue to endanger American communities and the safety of federal immigration enforcement officers.”
The attack on sanctuary jurisdictions is part of Trump’s larger war on immigration. On his first day in office, the president signed an executive order that included a directive to end federal funding to sanctuary jurisdictions. The order also threatens criminal investigation of any local official who does not assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.
Despite clear hostility from Republican lawmakers at the hearing, the Democratic mayors did not back down.
“We know there are myths about these laws. But we must not let mischaracterizations and fearmongering obscure the reality that Chicago’s crime rates are trending down,” said Brandon Johnson, the mayor of Chicago.
Denver Mayor Mike Johnston added that Denver’s crime rates went down when the city’s immigration population increased.
And, as Wu pointed out, much of the danger to Americans right now is coming from Republicans themselves, not the people they’re trying to deport.
“This federal administration is making hardworking, tax-paying, God-fearing residents afraid to live their lives,” Wu said. “A city that’s scared is not a city that’s safe. A land ruled by fear is not the land of the free.”
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt threw a tantrum Wednesday, as she floundered trying to explain Donald Trump’s tariffs.
During a press conference, Leavitt attempted to use the issue of fentanyl smuggling over America’s northern border to justify the president’s 25 percent tariffs on Canadian goods, but her explanation quickly fell apart. 
“There’s been more than a 2,000 percent increase in illegal fentanyl seizure at the northern border. Why? Because Canada is allowing that fentanyl to come to the United States,” Leavitt said. 
She added that the president sought “repercussions” for the deaths of American citizens who died of fentanyl overdoses. 
“But Karoline, respectfully, it’s just 43 pounds that were found last year—that’s less than a carry-on suitcase,” said NBC News’s senior White House correspondent Gabe Gutierrez. “Is that a lot of fentanyl compared to, say, Mexico? The vast majority of the fentanyl is brought in through Mexico, not Canada. So what else does Canada need to do?”
In 2024, a total of 43 pounds of fentanyl were seized at the northern border, while a whopping 21,100 pounds were seized over the southern border, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. By comparison, only two pounds of fentanyl were seized at the northern border in 2023, the 2,000 percent increase to which Leavitt referred. 
While technically both Gutierrez and Leavitt were right, the president’s propagandist appeared to become agitated when confronted with the actual numbers behind her supposedly frightening statistic.
“Well, I just told you, last year alone there was a 2,000 percent increase in illegal fentanyl—” Leavitt said.
“But it’s only 43 pounds, Karoline—” Gutierrez interjected. 
“You’re asking me for what the president’s justification is for these tariffs. It’s not up to you. You’re not the president, Gabe!” Leavitt snapped. 
“And frankly, I think it’s a little bit disrespect-ul [sic] to the families in this country that have lost loved ones at the hands of this deadly poison,” Leavitt continued. 
Not only did Trump’s chief communicator fail to offer a plausible explanation for why the U.S. needs to levy steep tariffs against its neighbors to the north, but earlier this week she failed to explain why exactly the tariffs would be good for Americans, merely citing “facts” without offering actual evidence. 
On Wednesday, the Trump administration granted a one-month exception to U.S. automobile companies from the 25 percent tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada after speaking with CEOs of Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis. Leavitt read a statement from Trump claiming to have told the auto executives to relocate their production to the U.S.
Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg had a cheeky take on Donald Trump’s speech to a joint session of Congress.
“We won the popular vote by big numbers and won counties in our country 2,700 to 525—on a map that reads almost completely red for Republican,” Trump told both chambers Tuesday night, using his win to claim that he had been given a “mandate” by the country to radically reimagine the federal government.
But the former South Bend mayor couldn’t help himself from adding a dash of spice to Trump’s reminder, offering to The Late Show With Stephen Colbert that the president may have won, but only by a historically tiny margin.
“Despite what you heard tonight, he came in with just under 50 percent of the vote,” Buttigieg said. “He won, I’m not disputing that. But it was the smallest popular vote margin since Nixon.
“I wonder how he feels about something that important being that small in his case,” Buttigieg mused with a smirk. “And he has lost support from there.”
“To be smaller than Tricky Dick is, uh—gives one pause, I would say,” Colbert quipped back.
Holy shit! Pete Buttigieg was on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, and man, does he know how to get under Donald Trump's skin...Man, oh man... 🤣 pic.twitter.com/ek66RjDLXH
A CNN Poll released this week found that just 39 percent of Americans felt the country was moving in the right direction, as opposed to 45 percent who believed it was moving in the wrong direction. 
Even Republicans don’t seem to believe in the “mandate” decree coming from the White House. In Tennessee over the weekend, an angry town hall before Representative Diana Harshbarger screamed, “No!” when the Republican lawmaker asked if there had been a “mandate to the president from the American people,” who she claimed “overwhelmingly” voted Trump in.
“We’re giving the billionaires tax cuts!” a man shouted at Harshbarger.
Donald Trump is already backing off some of his tariffs only one day after they went into effect.
On Wednesday, the Trump administration granted a one-month exception to U.S. automobile companies from the 25 percent tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada. The change came after the president spoke with CEOs of the Big Three automakers: Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis. Trump reportedly told the auto executives that they should move their production to the United States, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.
“We spoke with the Big Three auto dealers,” Trump said in a statement read by Leavitt. “We are going to give a one-month exemption on any autos coming through USMCA,” he added, referring to the free trade agreement between Mexico, the U.S., and Canada. Leavitt told reporters that Trump is open to additional exemptions, although none are planned at this time.
Trump imposed tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China on Tuesday, prompting the stock market to plummet and Mexican, Canadian, and Chinese leaders to announce retaliatory tariffs. The premier of Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, told the Associated Press that the auto industry in Canada and the U.S. could only last 10 days before assembly lines would start to shut down.
“People are going to lose their jobs,” Doug Ford said. 
The exemption follows remarks by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick Wednesday morning on Bloomberg Television that Trump would update his tariff plans later in the day.
“There are going to be tariffs, let’s be clear,” Lutnick said. “But what he’s thinking about is which sections of the market that can maybe—maybe—he’ll consider giving them relief until we get to, of course, April 2.”
Trump’s tariffs are expected to raise the prices of numerous goods in the U.S. aside from automobiles, including groceries, electronics, and farm equipment. They also will cause negative ripple effects for the American public, including higher utility bills, partly due to Ford’s threats to cut off electricity to the United States.
It remains to be seen if there will be more carve-outs for Trump’s tariffs, although a rapidly worsening economy could force the president’s hand. What Trump’s endgame is for his very unwise economic plans is not clear, but in the meantime, the American taxpayer will bear the brunt of his folly. 
In just a handful of weeks, Donald Trump’s nationalist policies and aggressive tariffs have rattled Canada’s economy, the American stock market, and, with it, the two nations’ long-standing alliance.
But Trump’s most recent approach to negotiating with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau amid the spontaneous trade war has taken a hard turn, more closely resembling catty high school gossip than legitimate foreign policy.
“Justin Trudeau, of Canada, called me to ask what could be done about Tariffs,” Trump posted on Truth Social Wednesday. “I told him that many people have died from Fentanyl that came through the Borders of Canada and Mexico, and nothing has convinced me that it has stopped.” 
“He said that it’s gotten better, but I said, ‘That’s not good enough.’ The call ended in a ‘somewhat’ friendly manner!” Trump continued. “He was unable to tell me when the Canadian Election is taking place, which made me curious, like, what’s going on here? I then realized he is trying to use this issue to stay in power. Good luck Justin!”
That lackadaisical response came on the heels of a harrowing address given Tuesday by Trudeau, in which the Canadian leader accused Trump of attempting to undermine Canada’s economy in order to “annex” it as America’s fifty-first state. He also urged Americans to look in the mirror and consider if they’re comfortable tossing the nation’s strongest Western alliances to effectively become Russia’s puppet.
Trump “feels strongly that it would be very beneficial for the Canadian people to be the fifty-first state of the United States. They wouldn’t be paying for these tariffs, and they’d have much lower taxes if they became a part of our great country,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Wednesday.

Elon Musk may be getting another handout from the federal government. 
The Wall Street Journal reports that the tech mogul’s satellite internet company, Starlink, could soon make up to $20 billion thanks to a Commerce Department overhaul of a Biden-era program to expand broadband internet access to rural areas. 
Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has told staff that he wants to make grants under the $42.5 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program “technology neutral,” which would give states the ability to allocate more funds to satellite internet providers like Starlink instead of companies using fiber-optic cable technology to connect rural areas.

However, a Freudian slip by the president during his joint session address Tuesday confirmed what DOGE employees and Justice Department attorneys had seemed to understand: that DOGE is actually “headed up by Elon Musk.”
In early February, Morgan Stanley positioned itself to offload upward of $5.5 billion of its outstanding debt in X. Musk had tapped the bank to help him acquire the social media platform for $44 billion in 2022, but the investment has since lost the bulk of its value. In 2023, Musk admitted that the site had lost 90 percent of its value under his stewardship.
China is ready to fight back in Donald Trump’s trade war, or any war for that matter.
On Tuesday, Trump spurred global financial chaos by imposing 25 percent tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico, and doubling tariffs on Chinese goods from 10 to 20 percent.
“If war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war, or any other type of war, we’re ready to fight till the end,” the Chinese Embassy wrote, in a post on X, following the announcement.
Trump claims the tariffs will force China to stop the flow of fentanyl to the United States, but China has already retaliated with its own tariffs—kicking off a trade war guaranteed to hurt American consumers.
“Chinese officials have failed to take the actions necessary to stem the flow of precursor chemicals to known criminal cartels and shut down money laundering by transnational criminal organizations,” a fact sheet accompanying Trump’s tariff announcement reads.
Beijing immediately took retaliatory action against the United States, imposing 15 percent tariffs on U.S. agricultural imports. Canada too has imposed 25 percent retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports, joining China and Mexico in their hostility toward Trump.
A spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry, Lin Jian, condemned the president’s decision at a press conference Wednesday and urged the U.S. to “return to the right track of dialogue and cooperation.”
“If the U.S. truly wants to solve the fentanyl issue, then the right thing to do is to consult with China on the basis of equality, mutual respect, and mutual benefit to address each other’s concerns,” Jian said. “If the U.S. has other agenda in mind, and if harming China’s interests is what the U.S. wants, we’re ready to fight till the end.”"
88,2025-03-05,"Democratic firebrand Representative Jasmine Crockett went after her Republican colleagues Wednesday for holding a sham hearing about crime in sanctuary cities. 
During the hearing before the Republican-led House Oversight Committee, in which four Democratic mayors defended their cities’ immigration polices, the Texas Democrat called out Republicans over their hypocritical focus on so-called migrant crime. 
“I know that many of you prepared for today’s hearing by making sure that you got a little bit of information about immigrants and crime in your cities. Let me ask each of the mayors, just yes or no,” Crockett said. 
“Have any of you been made aware of any immigrant that has had 34 felony convictions … that has still been able to roam in your cities?” she asked. 
Each of the four mayors predictably answered, “No,” or said nothing, and so Crockett continued. 
“I’m just curious because we are so concerned about crime, and I know that my Republican colleagues would never want anybody with 34 felony convictions roaming around, because that could be a danger to the community,” she said.
Crockett has been known for stirring the pot among her Republican colleagues, and was one of the Democratic lawmakers to walk out on Trump’s address to Congress on Tuesday night. 
The mayors who testified Wednesday were Mike Johnston of Denver, Brandon Johnson of Chicago, Michelle Wu of Boston, and the embattled Eric Adams of New York, who recently agreed to walk back certain measures protecting undocumented immigrants after the Department of Justice moved to drop his public corruption indictment, leading to allegations there had been a quid pro quo agreement. Adams continued to deny those claims Wednesday.
Boston Mayor Michelle Wu slammed Republican lawmakers for harming millions of Americans as she defended her city’s immigration policies at a House Oversight Committee hearing on sanctuary cities Wednesday.
In one particular exchange, Republican Representative Paul Gosar pressed Wu on federal immigration laws taking priority over local ones.
“Respectfully, Congressman, you could pass bipartisan legislation, and that would be comprehensive immigration law,” she replied.
“If you wanted to make us safe, pass gun reforms, stop cutting Medicaid, stop cutting cancer research, stop cutting funds for veterans. That is what will make our city safe,” she added as Gosar rolled his eyes.
She praised her city’s health care, low crime rates, higher education, and winning sports teams.
“We are the cradle of democracy and the city of champions. We are all of these things, not in spite of our immigrants but because of them,” Wu said.
The Boston mayor testified alongside the Democratic mayors of New York City, Denver, and Chicago, all of which are sanctuary cities, or jurisdictions with policies that limit information sharing with federal law enforcement to protect undocumented immigrants from deportation or prosecution. There are more than 600 sanctuary jurisdictions nationwide.
James Comer, the chair of the House Oversight Committee, and other Republicans, accused each city of putting its residents at risk and failing to comply with Donald Trump’s mass deportation plan. Comer is currently leading an investigation into sanctuary cities and their impact on federal immigration enforcement.
“Sanctuary cities make us all less safe and are a public safety nightmare,” Comer said at the hearing. “We cannot let pro-criminal alien policies of obstructionist sanctuary cities continue to endanger American communities and the safety of federal immigration enforcement officers.”
The attack on sanctuary jurisdictions is part of Trump’s larger war on immigration. On his first day in office, the president signed an executive order that included a directive to end federal funding to sanctuary jurisdictions. The order also threatens criminal investigation of any local official who does not assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.
Despite clear hostility from Republican lawmakers at the hearing, the Democratic mayors did not back down.
“We know there are myths about these laws. But we must not let mischaracterizations and fearmongering obscure the reality that Chicago’s crime rates are trending down,” said Brandon Johnson, the mayor of Chicago.
Denver Mayor Mike Johnston added that Denver’s crime rates went down when the city’s immigration population increased.
And, as Wu pointed out, much of the danger to Americans right now is coming from Republicans themselves, not the people they’re trying to deport.
“This federal administration is making hardworking, tax-paying, God-fearing residents afraid to live their lives,” Wu said. “A city that’s scared is not a city that’s safe. A land ruled by fear is not the land of the free.”
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt threw a tantrum Wednesday, as she floundered trying to explain Donald Trump’s tariffs.
During a press conference, Leavitt attempted to use the issue of fentanyl smuggling over America’s northern border to justify the president’s 25 percent tariffs on Canadian goods, but her explanation quickly fell apart. 
“There’s been more than a 2,000 percent increase in illegal fentanyl seizure at the northern border. Why? Because Canada is allowing that fentanyl to come to the United States,” Leavitt said. 
She added that the president sought “repercussions” for the deaths of American citizens who died of fentanyl overdoses. 
“But Karoline, respectfully, it’s just 43 pounds that were found last year—that’s less than a carry-on suitcase,” said NBC News’s senior White House correspondent Gabe Gutierrez. “Is that a lot of fentanyl compared to, say, Mexico? The vast majority of the fentanyl is brought in through Mexico, not Canada. So what else does Canada need to do?”
In 2024, a total of 43 pounds of fentanyl were seized at the northern border, while a whopping 21,100 pounds were seized over the southern border, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. By comparison, only two pounds of fentanyl were seized at the northern border in 2023, the 2,000 percent increase to which Leavitt referred. 
While technically both Gutierrez and Leavitt were right, the president’s propagandist appeared to become agitated when confronted with the actual numbers behind her supposedly frightening statistic.
“Well, I just told you, last year alone there was a 2,000 percent increase in illegal fentanyl—” Leavitt said.
“But it’s only 43 pounds, Karoline—” Gutierrez interjected. 
“You’re asking me for what the president’s justification is for these tariffs. It’s not up to you. You’re not the president, Gabe!” Leavitt snapped. 
“And frankly, I think it’s a little bit disrespect-ul [sic] to the families in this country that have lost loved ones at the hands of this deadly poison,” Leavitt continued. 
Not only did Trump’s chief communicator fail to offer a plausible explanation for why the U.S. needs to levy steep tariffs against its neighbors to the north, but earlier this week she failed to explain why exactly the tariffs would be good for Americans, merely citing “facts” without offering actual evidence. 
On Wednesday, the Trump administration granted a one-month exception to U.S. automobile companies from the 25 percent tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada after speaking with CEOs of Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis. Leavitt read a statement from Trump claiming to have told the auto executives to relocate their production to the U.S.
Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg had a cheeky take on Donald Trump’s speech to a joint session of Congress.
“We won the popular vote by big numbers and won counties in our country 2,700 to 525—on a map that reads almost completely red for Republican,” Trump told both chambers Tuesday night, using his win to claim that he had been given a “mandate” by the country to radically reimagine the federal government.
But the former South Bend mayor couldn’t help himself from adding a dash of spice to Trump’s reminder, offering to The Late Show With Stephen Colbert that the president may have won, but only by a historically tiny margin.
“Despite what you heard tonight, he came in with just under 50 percent of the vote,” Buttigieg said. “He won, I’m not disputing that. But it was the smallest popular vote margin since Nixon.
“I wonder how he feels about something that important being that small in his case,” Buttigieg mused with a smirk. “And he has lost support from there.”
“To be smaller than Tricky Dick is, uh—gives one pause, I would say,” Colbert quipped back.
Holy shit! Pete Buttigieg was on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, and man, does he know how to get under Donald Trump's skin...Man, oh man... 🤣 pic.twitter.com/ek66RjDLXH
A CNN Poll released this week found that just 39 percent of Americans felt the country was moving in the right direction, as opposed to 45 percent who believed it was moving in the wrong direction. 
Even Republicans don’t seem to believe in the “mandate” decree coming from the White House. In Tennessee over the weekend, an angry town hall before Representative Diana Harshbarger screamed, “No!” when the Republican lawmaker asked if there had been a “mandate to the president from the American people,” who she claimed “overwhelmingly” voted Trump in.
“We’re giving the billionaires tax cuts!” a man shouted at Harshbarger.
Donald Trump is already backing off some of his tariffs only one day after they went into effect.
On Wednesday, the Trump administration granted a one-month exception to U.S. automobile companies from the 25 percent tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada. The change came after the president spoke with CEOs of the Big Three automakers: Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis. Trump reportedly told the auto executives that they should move their production to the United States, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.
“We spoke with the Big Three auto dealers,” Trump said in a statement read by Leavitt. “We are going to give a one-month exemption on any autos coming through USMCA,” he added, referring to the free trade agreement between Mexico, the U.S., and Canada. Leavitt told reporters that Trump is open to additional exemptions, although none are planned at this time.
Trump imposed tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China on Tuesday, prompting the stock market to plummet and Mexican, Canadian, and Chinese leaders to announce retaliatory tariffs. The premier of Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, told the Associated Press that the auto industry in Canada and the U.S. could only last 10 days before assembly lines would start to shut down.
“People are going to lose their jobs,” Doug Ford said. 
The exemption follows remarks by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick Wednesday morning on Bloomberg Television that Trump would update his tariff plans later in the day.
“There are going to be tariffs, let’s be clear,” Lutnick said. “But what he’s thinking about is which sections of the market that can maybe—maybe—he’ll consider giving them relief until we get to, of course, April 2.”
Trump’s tariffs are expected to raise the prices of numerous goods in the U.S. aside from automobiles, including groceries, electronics, and farm equipment. They also will cause negative ripple effects for the American public, including higher utility bills, partly due to Ford’s threats to cut off electricity to the United States.
It remains to be seen if there will be more carve-outs for Trump’s tariffs, although a rapidly worsening economy could force the president’s hand. What Trump’s endgame is for his very unwise economic plans is not clear, but in the meantime, the American taxpayer will bear the brunt of his folly. 
In just a handful of weeks, Donald Trump’s nationalist policies and aggressive tariffs have rattled Canada’s economy, the American stock market, and, with it, the two nations’ long-standing alliance.
But Trump’s most recent approach to negotiating with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau amid the spontaneous trade war has taken a hard turn, more closely resembling catty high school gossip than legitimate foreign policy.
“Justin Trudeau, of Canada, called me to ask what could be done about Tariffs,” Trump posted on Truth Social Wednesday. “I told him that many people have died from Fentanyl that came through the Borders of Canada and Mexico, and nothing has convinced me that it has stopped.” 
“He said that it’s gotten better, but I said, ‘That’s not good enough.’ The call ended in a ‘somewhat’ friendly manner!” Trump continued. “He was unable to tell me when the Canadian Election is taking place, which made me curious, like, what’s going on here? I then realized he is trying to use this issue to stay in power. Good luck Justin!”
That lackadaisical response came on the heels of a harrowing address given Tuesday by Trudeau, in which the Canadian leader accused Trump of attempting to undermine Canada’s economy in order to “annex” it as America’s fifty-first state. He also urged Americans to look in the mirror and consider if they’re comfortable tossing the nation’s strongest Western alliances to effectively become Russia’s puppet.
Trump “feels strongly that it would be very beneficial for the Canadian people to be the fifty-first state of the United States. They wouldn’t be paying for these tariffs, and they’d have much lower taxes if they became a part of our great country,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Wednesday.
The president’s controversial tariffs went into effect first thing Tuesday, imposing 25 percent levies on Canada and Mexico as well as a 10 percent tariff hike on Chinese goods. In return, Canada and China slapped the U.S. with equal tariffs, while Mexico promised to do the same, with further details to come Sunday. Meanwhile, the spontaneously unpaused levies immediately followed reports that Trump had directed administration officials to draft a proposal that would lift sanctions on Russia. 
“I can tell you that every country is very, very aware that if the American government is willing to do this to their own closest ally, neighbor, and friend,” Trudeau said Tuesday. “Then everyone is vulnerable to a trade war.”
Less than a day after the tariffs went into effect, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox Business that they could be undone as soon as Thursday.
“Both the Canadians and Mexicans were on the phone with me all day today trying to show that they’ll do better,” Lutnick told the network, with regard to fentanyl flows into the U.S. “So I think [Trump] is going to work something out with them.”
The Department of Government Efficiency’s slashing of the federal workforce is disproportionately hurting veterans, and the damage is only going to get worse.
According to a March 4 memo first obtained by Government Executive, the Department of Veterans Affairs is planning to lay off as many as 83,000 employees. The Trump administration wants the department to get its workforce back to 2019 levels, when the VA employed 399,957 people and before millions of veterans became eligible for greater care. More than one in four VA employees are veterans.
The “aggressive” cuts will “resize and tailor the workforce to the mission and revised structure,” VA chief of staff Christopher Syrek wrote in the memo, which was sent to employees on Tuesday.
The department is expected to deliver its plans to “increase workforce efficiency” to the Office of Personnel Management by April 14.
Employment at the VA increased significantly under Biden with the passing of the 2022 PACT Act, which expanded health care benefits for veterans exposed to toxins and was the result of years’ worth of advocacy from various veteran organizations.
DOGE couldn’t care less. The pseudo-agency’s plan to fire 17 percent of the VA’s workforce is just the latest move in its assault on veterans and, more broadly, the federal government. Last month, DOGE laid off 2,400 VA employees and more than 6,000 veterans from other federal agencies.
DOGE also sought to terminate 875 affected contracts at the VA, which would significantly harm veterans’ access to health care services. The cuts have been temporarily suspended, but will likely resurface. 
Florida’s attorney general has launched an “active criminal investigation” into manosphere bigot Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan, who arrived in the country just last week at Donald Trump’s behest. 
The brothers returned to the U.S. from Romania, where they still face rape and human trafficking charges, after the Trump administration sought the return of their passports, opposing a court order requiring them to remain in the European nation while the investigation continued.
Now that the dual British-American citizens have returned stateside, they’ve found themselves the subject of yet another criminal investigation for alleged sex crimes.
“These guys have themselves publicly admitted to participating in what very much appears to be soliciting, trafficking, preying upon women around the world,” Attorney General James Uthmeier said Tuesday. 
“Many of these victims are coming forward, some of them minors—people can spin or defend however they want, but in Florida, this type of behavior is viewed as atrocious. We’re not going to accept it,” Uthmeier said. “They chose to come here and set their feet down in this state, and we’re going to pursue every tool we have within our legal authority to hold them accountable.”
Uthemeier announced the investigation in a post on X Tuesday, saying his office had conducted a “preliminary inquiry” into the brothers. “Based on a thorough review of the evidence, I’ve directed the Office of Statewide Prosecution to execute search warrants and issue subpoenas in the now-active criminal investigation into the Tate brothers,” he wrote.
Andrew Tate posted on X dozens of times between Tuesday and Wednesday, claiming his innocence and attacking Uthmeier and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who appointed the attorney general.
“This isn’t the America I know. This is a sad sad day for America,” Tate wrote in one post Tuesday, describing the investigation as “absolute communism.” 
Last week, Andrew Tate denied all wrongdoing. “We’ve no criminal record anywhere on the planet ever,” he said. 
That claim is still pending, however, as the brothers remain under investigation in Romania. Last year, a Romanian court ruled that after those court proceedings finished, the brothers could then be extradited to the U.K. to face additional charges of sex crimes. 
Andrew Tate, a former kickboxer and professional misogynist, is a central figure in the manosphere of contemptible internet chauvinists, a group of right-wing shills Trump utilized in his run for the presidency—and now intends to thank in kind. 
Elon Musk may be getting another handout from the federal government. 
The Wall Street Journal reports that the tech mogul’s satellite internet company, Starlink, could soon make up to $20 billion thanks to a Commerce Department overhaul of a Biden-era program to expand broadband internet access to rural areas. 
Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has told staff that he wants to make grants under the $42.5 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program “technology neutral,” which would give states the ability to allocate more funds to satellite internet providers like Starlink instead of companies using fiber-optic cable technology to connect rural areas.
Musk and Starlink could draw much more funding under the new rules. Under the program’s existing restrictions, states can only fund alternatives to fiber, such as satellite, in places where laying fiber cables isn’t cost-effective or feasible. Starlink was expected to haul in around $4.1 billion under the existing rules but could rake in anywhere from $10 billion to $20 billion if Lutnick’s changes are accepted. 
Those changes could be announced this week, albeit without many details, according to unnamed sources cited by the Journal. Implementing the overhaul could take longer, as some states may decide to change the allocation of funding they’ve already received. But Musk could easily grease the wheels or complicate matters if he devotes any X posts to the issue. 
The tech mogul and fascism enthusiast has benefited immensely from the Trump administration, only adding to his government-subsidized wealth as the world’s richest man. If these changes to rural broadband funding go through, not only will Musk get richer but his power in the federal government will increase and extend to rural America.  
Elon Musk told some of his biggest investors Wednesday that he’s looking to fully take over the federal government.
In a meeting with Morgan Stanley, the tech billionaire reportedly likened his influence over the federal government to a “corporate takeover.”
“To understand the federal government, it is like a corporate takeover at scale, but one where the company is actually in much worse shape than any commercial company could ever be,” Musk said at the conference, reported CNN’s Hadas Gold.
Musk then went on to say that “logically we should prioritize anything that can reasonably be privatized,” including public services such as the postal service and Amtrak.
Last month, officials with the United States Postal Service flagged that the Trump administration was looking to dissolve the organization’s governing board and place it under the control of the Commerce Department and Secretary Howard Lutnick. Experts believe doing so would likely violate federal law.
The USPS is practically as old as the country, and oversees the myriad shipping demands of the American public, supporting trillions of dollars in commerce.
It also “generally receives no tax dollars for operating expenses and relies on the sale of postage, products and services to fund its operations,” according to USPS’s website.
Still, that hasn’t prevented America’s public mail system from becoming a favorite target of the president. In 2020, Trump argued that the postal service should be dismantled to prevent voting by mail.
Meanwhile, Musk’s role in hacking and slashing federal spending has come under increased legal scrutiny, forcing the Trump administration to announce last week that it was Amy Gleason, a low-profile, first-term Trump official with experience in health care tech, rather than the high-profile billionaire who was leading the Department of Government Efficiency. Meanwhile, Musk has been officially titled a “senior adviser” to Trump. 
That title offers him “no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself,” the administration claimed, and leaves Musk with no formal responsibilities to run DOGE as either an employee or an administrator, but as a mere employee of the White House.
However, a Freudian slip by the president during his joint session address Tuesday confirmed what DOGE employees and Justice Department attorneys had seemed to understand: that DOGE is actually “headed up by Elon Musk.”

Employment at the VA increased significantly under Biden with the passing of the 2022 PACT Act, which expanded health care benefits for veterans exposed to toxins and was the result of years’ worth of advocacy from various veteran organizations.
DOGE couldn’t care less. The pseudo-agency’s plan to fire 17 percent of the VA’s workforce is just the latest move in its assault on veterans and, more broadly, the federal government. Last month, DOGE laid off 2,400 VA employees and more than 6,000 veterans from other federal agencies.
DOGE also sought to terminate 875 affected contracts at the VA, which would significantly harm veterans’ access to health care services. The cuts have been temporarily suspended, but will likely resurface. 
Florida’s attorney general has launched an “active criminal investigation” into manosphere bigot Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan, who arrived in the country just last week at Donald Trump’s behest. 
The brothers returned to the U.S. from Romania, where they still face rape and human trafficking charges, after the Trump administration sought the return of their passports, opposing a court order requiring them to remain in the European nation while the investigation continued.
Now that the dual British-American citizens have returned stateside, they’ve found themselves the subject of yet another criminal investigation for alleged sex crimes.
“These guys have themselves publicly admitted to participating in what very much appears to be soliciting, trafficking, preying upon women around the world,” Attorney General James Uthmeier said Tuesday. 
“Many of these victims are coming forward, some of them minors—people can spin or defend however they want, but in Florida, this type of behavior is viewed as atrocious. We’re not going to accept it,” Uthmeier said. “They chose to come here and set their feet down in this state, and we’re going to pursue every tool we have within our legal authority to hold them accountable.”
Uthemeier announced the investigation in a post on X Tuesday, saying his office had conducted a “preliminary inquiry” into the brothers. “Based on a thorough review of the evidence, I’ve directed the Office of Statewide Prosecution to execute search warrants and issue subpoenas in the now-active criminal investigation into the Tate brothers,” he wrote.
Andrew Tate posted on X dozens of times between Tuesday and Wednesday, claiming his innocence and attacking Uthmeier and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who appointed the attorney general.
“This isn’t the America I know. This is a sad sad day for America,” Tate wrote in one post Tuesday, describing the investigation as “absolute communism.” 
Last week, Andrew Tate denied all wrongdoing. “We’ve no criminal record anywhere on the planet ever,” he said. 
That claim is still pending, however, as the brothers remain under investigation in Romania. Last year, a Romanian court ruled that after those court proceedings finished, the brothers could then be extradited to the U.K. to face additional charges of sex crimes. 
Andrew Tate, a former kickboxer and professional misogynist, is a central figure in the manosphere of contemptible internet chauvinists, a group of right-wing shills Trump utilized in his run for the presidency—and now intends to thank in kind. 
Elon Musk may be getting another handout from the federal government. 
The Wall Street Journal reports that the tech mogul’s satellite internet company, Starlink, could soon make up to $20 billion thanks to a Commerce Department overhaul of a Biden-era program to expand broadband internet access to rural areas. 
Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has told staff that he wants to make grants under the $42.5 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program “technology neutral,” which would give states the ability to allocate more funds to satellite internet providers like Starlink instead of companies using fiber-optic cable technology to connect rural areas.
Musk and Starlink could draw much more funding under the new rules. Under the program’s existing restrictions, states can only fund alternatives to fiber, such as satellite, in places where laying fiber cables isn’t cost-effective or feasible. Starlink was expected to haul in around $4.1 billion under the existing rules but could rake in anywhere from $10 billion to $20 billion if Lutnick’s changes are accepted. 
Those changes could be announced this week, albeit without many details, according to unnamed sources cited by the Journal. Implementing the overhaul could take longer, as some states may decide to change the allocation of funding they’ve already received. But Musk could easily grease the wheels or complicate matters if he devotes any X posts to the issue. 
The tech mogul and fascism enthusiast has benefited immensely from the Trump administration, only adding to his government-subsidized wealth as the world’s richest man. If these changes to rural broadband funding go through, not only will Musk get richer but his power in the federal government will increase and extend to rural America.  
Elon Musk told some of his biggest investors Wednesday that he’s looking to fully take over the federal government.
In a meeting with Morgan Stanley, the tech billionaire reportedly likened his influence over the federal government to a “corporate takeover.”
“To understand the federal government, it is like a corporate takeover at scale, but one where the company is actually in much worse shape than any commercial company could ever be,” Musk said at the conference, reported CNN’s Hadas Gold.
Musk then went on to say that “logically we should prioritize anything that can reasonably be privatized,” including public services such as the postal service and Amtrak.
Last month, officials with the United States Postal Service flagged that the Trump administration was looking to dissolve the organization’s governing board and place it under the control of the Commerce Department and Secretary Howard Lutnick. Experts believe doing so would likely violate federal law.
The USPS is practically as old as the country, and oversees the myriad shipping demands of the American public, supporting trillions of dollars in commerce.
It also “generally receives no tax dollars for operating expenses and relies on the sale of postage, products and services to fund its operations,” according to USPS’s website.
Still, that hasn’t prevented America’s public mail system from becoming a favorite target of the president. In 2020, Trump argued that the postal service should be dismantled to prevent voting by mail.
Meanwhile, Musk’s role in hacking and slashing federal spending has come under increased legal scrutiny, forcing the Trump administration to announce last week that it was Amy Gleason, a low-profile, first-term Trump official with experience in health care tech, rather than the high-profile billionaire who was leading the Department of Government Efficiency. Meanwhile, Musk has been officially titled a “senior adviser” to Trump. 
That title offers him “no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself,” the administration claimed, and leaves Musk with no formal responsibilities to run DOGE as either an employee or an administrator, but as a mere employee of the White House.
However, a Freudian slip by the president during his joint session address Tuesday confirmed what DOGE employees and Justice Department attorneys had seemed to understand: that DOGE is actually “headed up by Elon Musk.”
In early February, Morgan Stanley positioned itself to offload upward of $5.5 billion of its outstanding debt in X. Musk had tapped the bank to help him acquire the social media platform for $44 billion in 2022, but the investment has since lost the bulk of its value. In 2023, Musk admitted that the site had lost 90 percent of its value under his stewardship.
China is ready to fight back in Donald Trump’s trade war, or any war for that matter.
On Tuesday, Trump spurred global financial chaos by imposing 25 percent tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico, and doubling tariffs on Chinese goods from 10 to 20 percent.
“If war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war, or any other type of war, we’re ready to fight till the end,” the Chinese Embassy wrote, in a post on X, following the announcement.
Trump claims the tariffs will force China to stop the flow of fentanyl to the United States, but China has already retaliated with its own tariffs—kicking off a trade war guaranteed to hurt American consumers.
“Chinese officials have failed to take the actions necessary to stem the flow of precursor chemicals to known criminal cartels and shut down money laundering by transnational criminal organizations,” a fact sheet accompanying Trump’s tariff announcement reads.
Beijing immediately took retaliatory action against the United States, imposing 15 percent tariffs on U.S. agricultural imports. Canada too has imposed 25 percent retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports, joining China and Mexico in their hostility toward Trump.
A spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry, Lin Jian, condemned the president’s decision at a press conference Wednesday and urged the U.S. to “return to the right track of dialogue and cooperation.”
“If the U.S. truly wants to solve the fentanyl issue, then the right thing to do is to consult with China on the basis of equality, mutual respect, and mutual benefit to address each other’s concerns,” Jian said. “If the U.S. has other agenda in mind, and if harming China’s interests is what the U.S. wants, we’re ready to fight till the end.”
Democratic Representative Al Green’s protest during Donald Trump’s address to Congress Tuesday night went too far for his Republican colleagues, who are now calling for his censure. 
The far-right House Freedom Caucus posted on X Wednesday that it plans to introduce “a censure resolution against Rep. Al Green today.” Other Republicans not in the caucus, including Representatives Troy Nehls and Dan Newhouse, have also indicated that they plan to introduce a resolution to censure Green. 
The effort will likely have the support of House Speaker Mike Johnson, who said Tuesday night that Green’s actions were “absolutely shameful. He should be censured.”
“It’s a spectacle that was not necessary. He’s made history in a terrible way, and I hope he enjoys it,” Johnson told The Hill.
Green says he plans to accept the consequences, saying that he shouted at the president “because Medicaid is so important to my constituents.”  
“If I broke the rules, then I have to be prepared to suffer the consequences. You don’t break the rules and then demand that you be treated as though nothing ever happened,” the Houston-area congressman told Axios. 
Green’s fellow Democrats in the House are backing up their colleague, with a leading House member and a centrist from the party telling Axios that they don’t expect anyone from the party to vote for the censure. Green isn’t backing down either, having already said earlier this month that he plans to introduce articles of impeachment against Trump. 
“Let them bring their sanctions. Bring them on,” Green said. "

Call it the case of the vanishing half a billion dollars.

        During the pandemic-era startup funding boom, the education technology company Byju's raised money from some of the biggest names in global investing. At its peak, the Bengaluru-based company was valued at $22 billion, making it the most valuable startup in India. But last week, a US judge ruled thatentities associated with Byju's had fraudulently transferred over $500 million to a group the judge deemed a ""sham.""
    

        The summary judgment in Delaware bankruptcy court, released on Thursday, advances the lenders' yearslong search for the missing money. Judge John T. Dorsey ruled against Riju Ravindran — a former Byju's board member and the founder's brother — and entities related to the company, including a hedge fund founded by a 23-year-old high school dropout.
    

        Dorsey found the $533 million was fraudulently transferred to what he called a ""high-risk and unproven hedge fund."" It had few other investors, a high fee structure, and, at one point, a Miami IHOP headquarters address with a non-working phone, per court documents. The ruling opens the door for damages — with a hearing about specifics still to be scheduled — and for the lenders to try to recover some of that money.
    

        In November 2021, after equity fundraising from BlackRock, the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative, and other power players, Byju's set up a special financing vehicle with $1.2 billion from top private lenders, including Ares Management and HPS Investment Partners. Led by the media-hungry founder Byju Raveendran, Byju's expanded quickly by snapping up other companies.
    

        Months after the lenders' money came in and without their knowledge, Ravindran transferred $533 million to a tiny hedge fund called Camshaft Capital, per Thursday's summary judgement. The fund was run by a portfolio manager named William Morton, who the lenders said in a complaint had no investment experience. The lenders' complaint said last year that Morton had recently bought three luxury cars: a 2023 Ferrari Roma, a 2020 Lamborghini Huracn EVO, and a 2014 Rolls-Royce Wraith.
    

        Ravindran's attorneys told the Delaware bankruptcy court that he moved the money to Camshaft because ""Byju's felt the need to protect the cash."" Ravindran said in sworn testimony that he had never heard of Camshaft before April 2022 and that he did no diligence prior to the transfers.
    

        Dorsey wrote in the summary judgment that Camshaft should have spotted ""numerous red flags"" pointing to the transactions' ""fraudulent purpose.""
    

        Camshaft then lent the money to a British company in a deal done without the lenders' approval, wrote Dorsey. The lenders have yet to trace the money, despite extensive efforts detailed in court documents.
    

        Last week's lawsuit is just one part of Byju's winding saga, which stretches across continents and involves more than a dozen lawsuits. While the level of funding Byju's commanded during its heyday sets it apart from the ed-tech competition, the company is part of a wave of global startups that picked up significant funding during the pandemic. At the time, investors scrambled to back companies amid record low interest rates. Now, lower valuations in a much different market threaten those good-times investments.
    

        After negotiations with Byju's fell apart over missed interest payments and other issues, the lenders put the special financing vehicle through involuntary bankruptcy. They appointed Timothy Pohl, a restructuring veteran, to manage the company and unravel the key mystery: the money's trail. But even after Pohl took over as the sole manager in March 2023, Ravindran continued to move money out, Dorsey wrote in Thursday's summary judgement.
    

        In May 2023, Raveendran told an advisor to the lenders that the money had gone ""someplace the Lenders will never find it,"" the advisor later wrote in a declaration.
    

        So far, legal proceedings have offered few clues about the missing $533 million. Morton and his fund were held in contempt of court last year for failure to cooperate with discovery. He told The Wall Street Journal last spring that he had fled the US with no plans to return — and that Camshaft is not a sham.
    

        Raveendran and Ravindran are last known to be living in Dubai. Ravindran was also held in contempt of court last year.
    

        The lenders said in a statement on Friday that they see the ruling as a ""significant step forward"" in their recovery efforts.
    

        ""We are gratified the Court unequivocally recognized that Riju Ravindran, Camshaft, and BYJU's together conducted a deliberate fraud on a global scale arising from the theft of $533 million,"" the lenders said in the statement.
    

        Byju's is still operating, but the company faces significant turmoil beyond the US bankruptcy case. BlackRock and at least one other equity investor have written off the value of their investments. BlackRock and the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative did not respond to Business Insider's requests for comment, nor did Byju's.
    

        Lawyers for Morton and Ravindran did not respond to requests for comment, nor did Morton or Raveendran. Ravindran could not be located for comment.
    

        Raveendran wrote on LinkedIn on Friday and again on Monday that he would rebuild the company.
    

        ""I will keep on keeping on. Till the wrongs are righted, and the mistakes are corrected,"" he posted on Monday.

My husband and I have always loved traveling the world together. And I was just hitting my stride as a working travel writer when our twins were born in 2014. But when we found ourselves new parents of two newborns at once, we were completely overwhelmed.

        Shell-shocked and woefully inexperienced, it took all of our concentration and determination just to go to the local farmer's market as a foursome. For this reason, we hardly did any travel by air while the kids were toddlers under 2. That is, we grounded ourselves for the entire fleeting period in time when we wouldn't have been required to buy the kids their own seats.
    

        We definitely didn't do any air travel when our twins were infants. We thought parenting was so hard back then — and in some ways, it truly was. But looking back on it, those early months, before they could even crawl and were thus naturally more self-contained, now seem like the perfect time to take them on long flights.
    

        Of course, it didn't seem that way at the time. Frankly, just keeping them and ourselves alive was a tall enough order; flying somewhere with our kids — especially somewhere far — seemed like advanced-level parenting that we were nowhere near ready for as bleary-eyed newbies with our hands and brains overfull. Nevermind all the gear that would have been required to make that happen, the thought alone of which was so exhausting.
    

        Back in those days, we frequently took them to a nearby park to watch the planes' thunderous landings at our home airport of LAX to get them excited about air travel. Happy as those memories are (and I think our strategy worked), it wasn't the same as fanning out around the globe.
    

        Flash forward a decade. Now that my kids are 10 and will soon wrap up elementary school, we've got the travel thing down like pros. They're seasoned travelers with fully stamped passports who know their way around a long-haul flight, a customs counter, and a subway map in another language. We are now living the exciting, rewarding, far-flung travel life I dreamed for us as a family, which had seemed so out of reach back then.
    

        I'm also acutely aware of how fast it all goes now that I am the experienced parent looking wistfully at the littles wherever we go. I see those parents' challenges; I lived those toy-flinging, bottle-feeding, and diaper-changing experiences and know them well. But I also wish I had been clear-headed enough back then to just push through.
    

        We could have saved tons of money on kids' plane tickets when they were under 2 and permitted to share our seats. Moreover, we could have absorbed more of the world's adult sightseeing opportunities, with infants strapped to our chests — back in the days before they required their own age-appropriate entertainment (and a souvenir at every stop).
    

        Am I looking back on this through the unrealistic lens that can only come from forgetting the true grit and physicality of early parenthood — with years of distance from being in the trenches? Absolutely, yes.
    

        But now that I have more confidence as a mom, it is nevertheless fun — and triggers some pangs of regret — to fantasize about what our travel life could have been like with pre-crawling babies had we felt more nimble then.
    

        People often ask me: Isn't it hard to travel with kids? I sum up my philosophy on it this way: Yes, it is, of course. But for me, it feels harder to live a life deprived of travel. Pushing through the inconveniences, stresses, and costs feels far less onerous to me — and much more rewarding — than accepting that I have to miss out on all of it, kicking the can years down the road into some unknown future that can never be guaranteed.
    

        So if I had it to do again, I'd start our family adventures earlier, seizing every opportunity to experience the world together at every stage.

Drones have always followed a predictable blueprint—four rotors, a boxy frame, and a design philosophy that values function over form. But every so often, something comes along that disrupts the status quo. Enter the V-Copter Falcon Mini, a drone that looks like it belongs in a sci-fi movie rather than a crowded electronics store. With its sleek, V-shaped frame and a bicopter propulsion system that defies conventional drone design, this lightweight machine is carving out a space of its own. Zero Zero Robotics, the company behind it, isn’t just experimenting for the sake of novelty. The Falcon Mini’s design unlocks efficiency gains that traditional quadcopters struggle to match, and in a market dominated by DJI, that’s enough to turn heads.
What makes this drone different isn’t just the way it looks—it’s how it moves. Instead of four fixed rotors working in tandem to keep the drone aloft, the Falcon Mini relies on two large, independently tilting propellers. The result? A flight system that’s both power-efficient and incredibly agile. Fewer motors mean less energy wasted on just staying in the air, allowing this compact drone to boast a flight time of up to 34 minutes. That’s a serious leap for something that weighs under 250 grams, a category that typically comes with battery trade-offs. And that weight classification isn’t just a bonus—it’s a game-changer. Many drone regulations are tied to the 250g mark, meaning the Falcon Mini sidesteps a lot of red tape, making it easier for enthusiasts to take to the skies without licensing headaches.
Designer: Zero Zero Robotics






Zero Zero Robotics has been playing with bicopter designs for years, but this is the first time the technology feels polished enough to shake up the market. Their original V-Copter Falcon, released in 2020, introduced the concept but was held back by its bulkier frame. The Falcon Mini refines that idea into something more practical, proving that fewer rotors don’t mean sacrificing stability. To showcase just how steady it is, the company balanced a coin on its fuselage during flight—an absurd yet effective demonstration of the drone’s precision. That stability is critical for aerial photography, and the Falcon Mini delivers with a three-axis stabilized 4K camera capable of real-time rotor adjustments down to 0.01 degrees.

The Falcon Mini’s servomotors, built from high-strength alloy steel, are rated for up to one million engagements, ensuring they won’t wear out anytime soon. That kind of longevity is rare in lightweight drones, which often sacrifice durability for portability. And then there’s the fun factor. Zero Zero Robotics is introducing a Reverse Flight Kit, which lets the Falcon Mini perform inverted flight maneuvers and wild spins. These might not be practical for capturing cinematic shots, but they do give experienced pilots a new level of creative control.






DJI’s grip on the consumer drone market has been ironclad for years, but the Falcon Mini signals that innovation is still alive and well outside the industry giant’s ecosystem. Bicopters have long been considered a niche concept, but the Falcon Mini makes a strong case for why they might just be the future. A drone that flies longer, avoids regulatory headaches, and delivers buttery-smooth footage? That’s something worth paying attention to. Pricing details are still under wraps, but if Zero Zero Robotics positions this right, the Falcon Mini won’t just be another drone on the market—it’ll be the one that changes how we think about them.

96,2025-03-05,"Donald Trump is already backing off some of his tariffs only one day after they went into effect.
On Wednesday, the Trump administration granted a one-month exception to U.S. automobile companies from the 25 percent tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada. The change came after the president spoke with CEOs of the Big Three automakers: Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis. Trump reportedly told the auto executives that they should move their production to the United States, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.
“We spoke with the Big Three auto dealers,” Trump said in a statement read by Leavitt. “We are going to give a one-month exemption on any autos coming through USMCA,” he added, referring to the free trade agreement between Mexico, the U.S., and Canada. Leavitt told reporters that Trump is open to additional exemptions, although none are planned at this time.
Trump imposed tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China on Tuesday, prompting the stock market to plummet and Mexican, Canadian, and Chinese leaders to announce retaliatory tariffs. The premier of Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, told the Associated Press that the auto industry in Canada and the U.S. could only last 10 days before assembly lines would start to shut down.
“People are going to lose their jobs,” Doug Ford said. 
The exemption follows remarks by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick Wednesday morning on Bloomberg Television that Trump would update his tariff plans later in the day.
“There are going to be tariffs, let’s be clear,” Lutnick said. “But what he’s thinking about is which sections of the market that can maybe—maybe—he’ll consider giving them relief until we get to, of course, April 2.”
Trump’s tariffs are expected to raise the prices of numerous goods in the U.S. aside from automobiles, including groceries, electronics, and farm equipment. They also will cause negative ripple effects for the American public, including higher utility bills, partly due to Ford’s threats to cut off electricity to the United States.
It remains to be seen if there will be more carve-outs for Trump’s tariffs, although a rapidly worsening economy could force the president’s hand. What Trump’s endgame is for his very unwise economic plans is not clear, but in the meantime, the American taxpayer will bear the brunt of his folly. 
In just a handful of weeks, Donald Trump’s nationalist policies and aggressive tariffs have rattled Canada’s economy, the American stock market, and, with it, the two nations’ long-standing alliance.
But Trump’s most recent approach to negotiating with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau amid the spontaneous trade war has taken a hard turn, more closely resembling catty high school gossip than legitimate foreign policy.
“Justin Trudeau, of Canada, called me to ask what could be done about Tariffs,” Trump posted on Truth Social Wednesday. “I told him that many people have died from Fentanyl that came through the Borders of Canada and Mexico, and nothing has convinced me that it has stopped.” 
“He said that it’s gotten better, but I said, ‘That’s not good enough.’ The call ended in a ‘somewhat’ friendly manner!” Trump continued. “He was unable to tell me when the Canadian Election is taking place, which made me curious, like, what’s going on here? I then realized he is trying to use this issue to stay in power. Good luck Justin!”
That lackadaisical response came on the heels of a harrowing address given Tuesday by Trudeau, in which the Canadian leader accused Trump of attempting to undermine Canada’s economy in order to “annex” it as America’s fifty-first state. He also urged Americans to look in the mirror and consider if they’re comfortable tossing the nation’s strongest Western alliances to effectively become Russia’s puppet.
Trump “feels strongly that it would be very beneficial for the Canadian people to be the fifty-first state of the United States. They wouldn’t be paying for these tariffs, and they’d have much lower taxes if they became a part of our great country,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Wednesday.
The president’s controversial tariffs went into effect first thing Tuesday, imposing 25 percent levies on Canada and Mexico as well as a 10 percent tariff hike on Chinese goods. In return, Canada and China slapped the U.S. with equal tariffs, while Mexico promised to do the same, with further details to come Sunday. Meanwhile, the spontaneously unpaused levies immediately followed reports that Trump had directed administration officials to draft a proposal that would lift sanctions on Russia. 
“I can tell you that every country is very, very aware that if the American government is willing to do this to their own closest ally, neighbor, and friend,” Trudeau said Tuesday. “Then everyone is vulnerable to a trade war.”
Less than a day after the tariffs went into effect, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox Business that they could be undone as soon as Thursday.
“Both the Canadians and Mexicans were on the phone with me all day today trying to show that they’ll do better,” Lutnick told the network, with regard to fentanyl flows into the U.S. “So I think [Trump] is going to work something out with them.”
The Department of Government Efficiency’s slashing of the federal workforce is disproportionately hurting veterans, and the damage is only going to get worse.
According to a March 4 memo first obtained by Government Executive, the Department of Veterans Affairs is planning to lay off as many as 83,000 employees. The Trump administration wants the department to get its workforce back to 2019 levels, when the VA employed 399,957 people and before millions of veterans became eligible for greater care. More than one in four VA employees are veterans.
The “aggressive” cuts will “resize and tailor the workforce to the mission and revised structure,” VA chief of staff Christopher Syrek wrote in the memo, which was sent to employees on Tuesday.
The department is expected to deliver its plans to “increase workforce efficiency” to the Office of Personnel Management by April 14.
Employment at the VA increased significantly under Biden with the passing of the 2022 PACT Act, which expanded health care benefits for veterans exposed to toxins and was the result of years’ worth of advocacy from various veteran organizations.
DOGE couldn’t care less. The pseudo-agency’s plan to fire 17 percent of the VA’s workforce is just the latest move in its assault on veterans and, more broadly, the federal government. Last month, DOGE laid off 2,400 VA employees and more than 6,000 veterans from other federal agencies.
DOGE also sought to terminate 875 affected contracts at the VA, which would significantly harm veterans’ access to health care services. The cuts have been temporarily suspended, but will likely resurface. 
Florida’s attorney general has launched an “active criminal investigation” into manosphere bigot Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan, who arrived in the country just last week at Donald Trump’s behest. 
The brothers returned to the U.S. from Romania, where they still face rape and human trafficking charges, after the Trump administration sought the return of their passports, opposing a court order requiring them to remain in the European nation while the investigation continued.
Now that the dual British-American citizens have returned stateside, they’ve found themselves the subject of yet another criminal investigation for alleged sex crimes.
“These guys have themselves publicly admitted to participating in what very much appears to be soliciting, trafficking, preying upon women around the world,” Attorney General James Uthmeier said Tuesday. 
“Many of these victims are coming forward, some of them minors—people can spin or defend however they want, but in Florida, this type of behavior is viewed as atrocious. We’re not going to accept it,” Uthmeier said. “They chose to come here and set their feet down in this state, and we’re going to pursue every tool we have within our legal authority to hold them accountable.”
Uthemeier announced the investigation in a post on X Tuesday, saying his office had conducted a “preliminary inquiry” into the brothers. “Based on a thorough review of the evidence, I’ve directed the Office of Statewide Prosecution to execute search warrants and issue subpoenas in the now-active criminal investigation into the Tate brothers,” he wrote.
Andrew Tate posted on X dozens of times between Tuesday and Wednesday, claiming his innocence and attacking Uthmeier and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who appointed the attorney general.
“This isn’t the America I know. This is a sad sad day for America,” Tate wrote in one post Tuesday, describing the investigation as “absolute communism.” 
Last week, Andrew Tate denied all wrongdoing. “We’ve no criminal record anywhere on the planet ever,” he said. 
That claim is still pending, however, as the brothers remain under investigation in Romania. Last year, a Romanian court ruled that after those court proceedings finished, the brothers could then be extradited to the U.K. to face additional charges of sex crimes. 
Andrew Tate, a former kickboxer and professional misogynist, is a central figure in the manosphere of contemptible internet chauvinists, a group of right-wing shills Trump utilized in his run for the presidency—and now intends to thank in kind. 
Elon Musk may be getting another handout from the federal government. 
The Wall Street Journal reports that the tech mogul’s satellite internet company, Starlink, could soon make up to $20 billion thanks to a Commerce Department overhaul of a Biden-era program to expand broadband internet access to rural areas. 
Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has told staff that he wants to make grants under the $42.5 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program “technology neutral,” which would give states the ability to allocate more funds to satellite internet providers like Starlink instead of companies using fiber-optic cable technology to connect rural areas.
Musk and Starlink could draw much more funding under the new rules. Under the program’s existing restrictions, states can only fund alternatives to fiber, such as satellite, in places where laying fiber cables isn’t cost-effective or feasible. Starlink was expected to haul in around $4.1 billion under the existing rules but could rake in anywhere from $10 billion to $20 billion if Lutnick’s changes are accepted. 
Those changes could be announced this week, albeit without many details, according to unnamed sources cited by the Journal. Implementing the overhaul could take longer, as some states may decide to change the allocation of funding they’ve already received. But Musk could easily grease the wheels or complicate matters if he devotes any X posts to the issue. 
The tech mogul and fascism enthusiast has benefited immensely from the Trump administration, only adding to his government-subsidized wealth as the world’s richest man. If these changes to rural broadband funding go through, not only will Musk get richer but his power in the federal government will increase and extend to rural America.  
Elon Musk told some of his biggest investors Wednesday that he’s looking to fully take over the federal government.
In a meeting with Morgan Stanley, the tech billionaire reportedly likened his influence over the federal government to a “corporate takeover.”
“To understand the federal government, it is like a corporate takeover at scale, but one where the company is actually in much worse shape than any commercial company could ever be,” Musk said at the conference, reported CNN’s Hadas Gold.
Musk then went on to say that “logically we should prioritize anything that can reasonably be privatized,” including public services such as the postal service and Amtrak.
Last month, officials with the United States Postal Service flagged that the Trump administration was looking to dissolve the organization’s governing board and place it under the control of the Commerce Department and Secretary Howard Lutnick. Experts believe doing so would likely violate federal law.
The USPS is practically as old as the country, and oversees the myriad shipping demands of the American public, supporting trillions of dollars in commerce.
It also “generally receives no tax dollars for operating expenses and relies on the sale of postage, products and services to fund its operations,” according to USPS’s website.
Still, that hasn’t prevented America’s public mail system from becoming a favorite target of the president. In 2020, Trump argued that the postal service should be dismantled to prevent voting by mail.
Meanwhile, Musk’s role in hacking and slashing federal spending has come under increased legal scrutiny, forcing the Trump administration to announce last week that it was Amy Gleason, a low-profile, first-term Trump official with experience in health care tech, rather than the high-profile billionaire who was leading the Department of Government Efficiency. Meanwhile, Musk has been officially titled a “senior adviser” to Trump. 
That title offers him “no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself,” the administration claimed, and leaves Musk with no formal responsibilities to run DOGE as either an employee or an administrator, but as a mere employee of the White House.
However, a Freudian slip by the president during his joint session address Tuesday confirmed what DOGE employees and Justice Department attorneys had seemed to understand: that DOGE is actually “headed up by Elon Musk.”
In early February, Morgan Stanley positioned itself to offload upward of $5.5 billion of its outstanding debt in X. Musk had tapped the bank to help him acquire the social media platform for $44 billion in 2022, but the investment has since lost the bulk of its value. In 2023, Musk admitted that the site had lost 90 percent of its value under his stewardship.
China is ready to fight back in Donald Trump’s trade war, or any war for that matter.
On Tuesday, Trump spurred global financial chaos by imposing 25 percent tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico, and doubling tariffs on Chinese goods from 10 to 20 percent.
“If war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war, or any other type of war, we’re ready to fight till the end,” the Chinese Embassy wrote, in a post on X, following the announcement.
Trump claims the tariffs will force China to stop the flow of fentanyl to the United States, but China has already retaliated with its own tariffs—kicking off a trade war guaranteed to hurt American consumers.
“Chinese officials have failed to take the actions necessary to stem the flow of precursor chemicals to known criminal cartels and shut down money laundering by transnational criminal organizations,” a fact sheet accompanying Trump’s tariff announcement reads.
Beijing immediately took retaliatory action against the United States, imposing 15 percent tariffs on U.S. agricultural imports. Canada too has imposed 25 percent retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports, joining China and Mexico in their hostility toward Trump.
A spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry, Lin Jian, condemned the president’s decision at a press conference Wednesday and urged the U.S. to “return to the right track of dialogue and cooperation.”
“If the U.S. truly wants to solve the fentanyl issue, then the right thing to do is to consult with China on the basis of equality, mutual respect, and mutual benefit to address each other’s concerns,” Jian said. “If the U.S. has other agenda in mind, and if harming China’s interests is what the U.S. wants, we’re ready to fight till the end.”
Democratic Representative Al Green’s protest during Donald Trump’s address to Congress Tuesday night went too far for his Republican colleagues, who are now calling for his censure. 
The far-right House Freedom Caucus posted on X Wednesday that it plans to introduce “a censure resolution against Rep. Al Green today.” Other Republicans not in the caucus, including Representatives Troy Nehls and Dan Newhouse, have also indicated that they plan to introduce a resolution to censure Green. 
The effort will likely have the support of House Speaker Mike Johnson, who said Tuesday night that Green’s actions were “absolutely shameful. He should be censured.”
“It’s a spectacle that was not necessary. He’s made history in a terrible way, and I hope he enjoys it,” Johnson told The Hill.
Green says he plans to accept the consequences, saying that he shouted at the president “because Medicaid is so important to my constituents.”  
“If I broke the rules, then I have to be prepared to suffer the consequences. You don’t break the rules and then demand that you be treated as though nothing ever happened,” the Houston-area congressman told Axios. 
Green’s fellow Democrats in the House are backing up their colleague, with a leading House member and a centrist from the party telling Axios that they don’t expect anyone from the party to vote for the censure. Green isn’t backing down either, having already said earlier this month that he plans to introduce articles of impeachment against Trump. 
“Let them bring their sanctions. Bring them on,” Green said. 
Greenland’s Prime Minister Múte Bourup Egede hit back at Donald Trump’s outlandish threat to acquire the Danish territory “one way or the other.”
In his address to Congress Tuesday night, Trump gave conflicting messages to the citizens of Greenland. While he claimed to “strongly support” Greenlanders’ “right to determine [their] own future,” and promised to keep them safe and make them rich, the president also restated that the United States would succeed in acquiring the territory. 
“We need it really for international world security. And I think we’re going to get it. One way or the other, we’re going to get it,” Trump said. 
The president said that his administration was “working with everybody involved to try to get it.”
Despite what Trump claimed Tuesday, it seems that neither the leaders of Greenland nor Denmark are actually playing ball with his wild imperialist threat. Egede shut down Trump’s comments in a post on Facebook Wednesday, written in Greenlandic and Danish.
“Kalaallit Nunaat is ours,” Egede wrote, using the Greenlandic term meaning “Land of the People,” or the “Land of the Greenlanders.”
“We don’t want to be Americans, nor Danes; we are Kalaallit. The Americans and their leader must understand that. We are not for sale and cannot simply be taken. Our future will be decided by us in Greenland,” Egede wrote in the post. 
Meanwhile, Denmark’s Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said that Trump’s reference to Greenlanders’ right to self determination was the most important part of the speech—especially with the parliamentary elections approaching next week. He stressed that it was important for the election to proceed “without any kind of international intervention.”
But Trump’s outrageous threats to acquire Greenland have become a hot-button issue on the island, and while his attempts at outreach have ranged from frivolous to ineffectual, his rhetoric about making the territory the “fifty-second state” has already electrified the independence movement there. 
Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen insisted that Greenland was not for sale in a television interview after Trump’s address. Last month, Trump made a startling phone call to Frederiksen and was reportedly “aggressive and confrontational,” threatening tariffs against the country unless it does exactly what he wants—flying in the face of his false promises about self-determination. 
Despite the fact that leadership hardly seems interested in handing over control of the mineral-rich territory to the U.S, that hasn’t stopped Republicans from letting their imaginations run away with them. Last month, Republican Representative Buddy Carter of Georgia filed a bill to rename Greenland “Red, White, and Blueland.”
Fox News’s Laura Ingraham scoffed at Republicans’ plan to steer clear of in-person town halls after being confronted by angry protesters.
At a private meeting Tuesday, Representative Richard Hudson, head of the National Republican Congressional Committee, advised House Republicans to hold virtual town hall meetings or Facebook live events instead so they could moderate feedback from the audience—a feeble attempt to avoid anybody who disagrees with them.
“I thought that was lame. Look, the Tea Party showed up at the Democrat town halls, and we complained that we were thrown out,” Ingraham said on air Tuesday evening. “So now you’re going to say don’t show up—I say let them show up. Let’s see exactly who these people are. When you engage them in conversation … they can’t back up what they are saying with real arguments.”
In recent weeks, Republican town halls have been bombarded by angry constituents, Democratic and Republican alike, who are frustrated with Trump and Elon Musk’s chaos-inducing assault on the government.
House Speaker Mike Johnson, who supports the halting of in-person town halls, tried to claim that the protesters were being paid by Democrats.
“Now I’m not saying everyone in these town halls that you’ve seen on television were not from the local area, but look, there are people who do this as a profession,” Johnson told reporters Tuesday. “They’re professional protesters. So why would we give them a forum to do that right now?”
The strategy has been slammed by Democrats, and now by Fox News. Ingraham’s take? Let them argue, paid or not.
“Let’s go … First Amendment, baby.” "
97,2025-03-05,"Tandem OLED panels are one of the newest display technologies seen in laptops. Here's how they compare to other screen types.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

A tandem OLED display like the one on the new Dell XPS 13 is one of the latest panel technologies to come to the laptop market.
But what are they, exactly? Are tandem OLED laptops worth using? And how do these screens compare to OLED, IPS LCD, miniLED, QDEL, and other panel types?
I was curious about tandem OLED displays, so I did some research and reached out to Dell to answer my questions.
Here's everything I discovered and everything you need to know about tandem OLED displays.
Each display's capabilities will be different based on the specific technologies used in its production as well as the intended use case it was designed for. As such, the information on this page focuses on generalizations and tendencies for various display types, but individual panels may differ.

Before we dive into tandem OLEDs, it's important to cover OLED basics.
As I explained in my display comparison guide, OLED, or Organic Light-Emitting Diode, is a display technology that ""doesn't require backlighting like older displays did, thanks to the use of an organic compound that emits light when it receives an electric current.""
In addition to not being backlit, OLEDs have largely been able to stand out from previous panel types due to their ability to change the light and color of each individual pixel, as well as turn pixels off independently.
All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.
This design allows OLEDs to produce wider viewing angles, greater color gamuts, TrueBlack, and excellent contrast compared with many other panel types.

OLED displays have a few different layers to them, and these can differ depending on the technologies a company uses to create the screen as a whole.
The first OLEDs had some screen burn-in issues, but these degradation risks have been greatly reduced over the years. Otherwise, the biggest problem with OLEDs is that they tend not to get as bright as other display types.

Some adamantly argue that OLEDs are the best displays out there. Just remember, each display type has its pros and cons, and each type can be better suited to different use cases.
Really, it depends on what a consumer wants most from their display.
For instance, you could argue that tandem OLEDs, with their amazing color gamuts and contrast, are ideal for creatives, while TN (twisted nematic) displays are best for competitive gaming since they offer higher refresh rates. It really just depends.
Each display type has its pros and cons and might be better suited to different use cases. 
Still, OLEDs have largely been considered one of the best laptop displays for some time now.
However, panel technology has continued to advance, bringing forward alternative solutions to challenge OLED's throne. For instance, QDEL (Quantum Dot Electroluminescent) displays tend to be far brighter than OLED. Meanwhile, mini LED panels tend to be more affordable and offer better battery life, but often don't produce as good color accuracy as OLEDs.
As a side note, some are saying that it's possible that QDEL could replace OLED in the future. But to be clear, we're probably a few years off from seeing QDEL panels on laptops, TVs, and monitors.
In the meantime, we have brand-new tandem OLED panels that have hit the laptop market for the first time in 2025, and they are typically better than traditional single-panel OLEDs, allowing the general category of OLED to still offer one of the best viewing experiences.

The concept of tandem OLEDs isn't new, but it was only with the launch of the Apple iPad Pro (M4) that the first mainstream tandem OLED device hit store shelves. Now, we're seeing this display technology in laptops.
As the name implies, tandem OLED means that there are two OLED panels, one on top of the other. This can result in a display that can produce an even better color range and better HDR TrueBlack visuals than a single-panel OLED, while also being able to get much brighter than a basic OLED.
As contradictory as it might sound at first, some of these new tandem OLED panels consume less power than a traditional single-panel OLED when producing the same brightness level.
That's because the two panels don't have to be at as high of a brightness level on their own to achieve a desired brightness level together.
Because the dual panels don't have to get as individually bright, well-designed tandem OLED displays might not drain a laptop battery as quickly as a single-panel OLED, and well-designed tandem OLEDs aren't as at risk for screen burn-in.

So, how much brighter are we talking? In general, OLEDs usually can get between 200 and 300 nits at SDR but can sometimes jump up to around 500 nits in peak HDR.
Meanwhile, tandem OLEDs have been known to get up to around 1,000 nits in SDR and up to 1,600 nits in peak HDR brightness. That's quite a jump.
This all said, some tandem OLEDs, like the one on the Dell XPS 13, will still only produce 400 to 500 nits max but will also offer better HDR TrueBlack, improved contrast, and a wider color range than typically seen on single-panel OLEDs.
In other words, a company might design its tandem OLEDs to focus on other features that improve the visual experience rather than just increasing brightness.
The thing is, tandem OLED technology is so new to the market that there are only a few laptops that actually have these displays, but more are coming.
Tandem OLED laptops include the Dell XPS 13 (Lunar Lake), Dell Pro Premium, and Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i Aura Edition Gen 10. Right now, there are only a small number of laptops with tandem OLED displays. , but more will come to the market as time goes on.
The thing is, spec pages for laptops with these displays don't always make it clear that they feature this new dual-stack OLED design, so it's not something you can easily search for at present.

Remember how I said tandem OLED capabilities will be different based on how a company designs them? Well, this is what Dell told me about its tandem-OLED-toting XPS 13 9530:
""XPS 13 uses a tandem OLED design co-developed with one of our display partners. By using tandem technology, which stacks multiple emissive layers on top of each other, it increased the efficiency of our OLED display. This design allows for higher brightness and a longer lifespan with the same power input. Multiple layers enable these new tandem OLEDs to achieve higher luminous efficiency, meaning the display can produce more light compared to single-stack OLEDs currently on the market using the same amount of electrical power.
""Because OLEDs generally consume more power than traditional LCD (IPS) panels, minimizing power consumption is crucial. The XPS 13's new tandem OLED design lowers power consumption for the same brightness compared to the older single-stack OLED, which helps extend battery life. This new design, combined with tandem technology, improves battery runtime by about 10% while also being thinner and lighter. As a result, the new XPS 13 is approximately 3% thinner and 5% lighter than the previous generation with its older OLED.
""We list our spec for XPS 13’s OLED at 400 nits due to its inherently better contrast ratios compared to LCDs, which are spec'd at 500 nits. The new OLED design and tandem technology not only achieves lower power consumption but also features HDR TrueBlack 500, with 1,000,000:1 contrast ratios and 1.07 billion colors.""
So once again, Dell XPS 13's tandem OLED display might not get as bright as some other tandem OLEDs on the market, but Dell says it still offers better power consumption and a better visual experience than a single-panel OLED.
Hopefully, I was able to answer any questions you have about tandem OLEDs, but just in case you have further queries, I've embedded this video from Snazzy Labs and also included this FAQ section.
As implied by the name, tandem OLED is a display technology that layers two OLED panels over each other rather than just having one OLED layer. 
This stacked design can allow these screens to get brighter and offer better color and contrast than single-layer OLEDs. Additionally, tandem OLEDs can draw less power than traditional OLEDs and thus offer better laptop battery life. 
Many people hadn't heard about tandem OLEDs until 2024 when the Apple iPad Pro (M4) brought this display technology to the market. However, these displays, or at least the idea of them, have been around for a while.
It turns out that the concept for this dual-stacked OLED design is at least 15 years old, as seen in this paper from 2009 (thanks Digital Trends).
But, as I previously mentioned, it wasn't until 2025 that we saw the first tandem OLED laptops hit the market, so they are very new from a purchasable standpoint. 
Since a tandem OLED is literally two OLED panels stacked on each other, the main differences are that tandem OLEDs tend to get much brighter than OLED panels, which historically are pretty dim compared to other display technologies. 
Depending on how they were designed and made, tandem OLEDs can also produce more colors, better contrast, and consume less power than OLEDs. 
It is possible for tandem OLEDs to experience burn-in, depending on how a company designed them, but the risk of screen degradation is typically lower than with OLEDs. 
That's because having two OLED panels in tandem OLEDs means that neither layer has to get as bright as a basic OLED's individual panel layer to reach the same brightness level. 
Depending on how a company designs its tandem OLED, double-stacking OLED panels can allow the overall display to produce a specific level of brightness without requiring as much power as a single-panel OLED to do so.
However, the amount of power drawn from an OLED layer also depends on what is being displayed.
Remember, OLEDs and tandem OLEDs have the ability to turn pixels off when they're supposed to show black. As such, a screen draws less power if it's showing darker imagery (like those ridiculously dark Game of Thrones scenes). 
So, a tandem OLED might allow for better battery life on a laptop than a basic OLED, but a direct comparison might only show this to be true if the two tandem OLEDs are displaying the same visuals. 
The exact efficiency of tandem OLEDs will vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. 
In general, well-designed tandem OLEDs are more efficient than OLED panels.
Yes. Tandem OLED displays aren't perfect, but they are a very competitive technology among panel types. 
Depending on the manufacturer, they can offer better power draw efficiency, produce more colors, provide improved contrast, and get a lot brighter than other display types, all while having a lower risk of screen burn-in than basic, single-panel OLEDs. 
The biggest things going against tandem OLEDs right now are two-fold. Firstly, there are fewer of them on the market, so it can be hard to find a device that has a tandem OLED display. Secondly, tandem OLED laptops tend to cost more than other display options. So, it can be more expensive to get one.
As with most new display technologies, the price for tandem OLEDs could go down as time goes on, depending on manufacturer advances and how much demand there is for this technology.
