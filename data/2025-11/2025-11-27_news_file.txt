Retail is a tough industry where top brands post massive revenue figures, employ hundreds of thousands of people, and chase relatively tight profit margins.
And while retail CEOs don't usually see the same rockstar treatment that tech execs enjoy, they are still in high demand.
Leaders of these large retail chains are often paid eight-figure compensation packages for managing this complexity, based on Business Insider's analysis of proxy filings over the past year.
Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol was among the 100 top-paid CEOs in the S&P 500 last year, the most recent period when executive compensation data is available. Niccol's compensation included hefty signing bonuses for leaving his job at Chipotle.
While some CEOs, including Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett, may not be fans of pay disclosure rules and their impact on executive pay packages, the numbers offer an interesting insight into how companies value their CEOs.
The pay packages typically consist of a base salary, plus stock awards, cash bonuses (i.e., non-equity incentives), and other perks, like 401 (k) contributions and private jet usage.
Here's what the CEOs of 30 of the largest restaurant and retail chains made last year, in ascending order.
GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen's pay package consisted exclusively of a $268,553 security detail that the company provides for him.
Amazon CEO Andy Jassy made nearly $1.6 million last year, which included a base salary of $365,000 and more than $1.1 million in travel and security expenses. Company filings also show he had more than $274 million worth of restricted Amazon stock that had not yet vested as of December 31.
Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos took home $2.15 million last year, which included a base salary of $1.4 million, $214,849 in non-equity incentives, and $406,581 from the personal use of the company airplane and related ground transportation.
Brad Beckham of O'Reilly Automotive made over $2.8 million last year on a base salary of $971,154, plus $1.25 million in options and $500,000 in non-equity incentives.
Texas Roadhouse CEO Gerald Morgan made nearly $6.2 million last year on a $1.3 million base salary, plus $2.6 million in stock awards and $2.3 million in non-equity incentives.
Dollar Tree CEO Michael Creedon made about $7.6 million in his first fiscal year as CEO with a base salary of $1 million, stock awards of $4.8 million, options of $1.2 million, and non-equity incentives of $608,300. Because he only served part of the year, the company said his total annualized earnings were closer to $9.2 million.
Genuine Parts Company CEO William Stengel, who took on the role in June 2024, made over $7.7 million last year. That included a base salary of $911,667, $5.5 million in stock awards, and nearly $1 million in non-equity incentives.
Domino's Pizza CEO Russell Weiner made $8.9 million last year, which included a base salary of $913,462, plus $4.4 million in stock awards, $1.4 million in options, and nearly $2 million in non-equity incentives. He also did $194,419 worth of personal travel on the company airplane.
AutoZone CEO Philip Daniele's $9.6 million package included a $1 million base salary, plus $7.2 million in stock options and $1.25 million in non-equity incentives.

Costco CEO Ron Vachris made $12.3 million, comprising a base salary of $1.1 million, plus $10.6 million in stock awards, and $434,333 in non-equity incentives. He also used about $56,000 worth of travel on the company aircraft and received a complimentary Executive Membership to his club valued at $120.
Dick's Sporting Goods CEO Lauren Hobart made nearly $13 million last year with a $1.3 million base salary, $7.5 million in stock awards, and $3.8 million in non-equity incentives.
BJ's Wholesale Club CEO Bob Eddy made over $13.6 million last year with a base salary of $1.35 million, stock awards of $9.5 million, and non-equity incentives of $2.4 million. He also used a private plane for travel — a benefit worth $199,215.
Joshua Kobza, CEO of Restaurant Brands Inc. — owner of chains like Burger King and Tim Horton's — made about $14.4 million last year on a $941,667 base salary, stock awards of $11.6 million, non-equity incentives of $1.1 million, and tax equalization of $749,167.

Former Ross Stores CEO Barbara Rentler made nearly $17 million last year, with a $1.4 million base salary, plus $10.7 million in stock awards and $4.6 million in non-equity incentives.
McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski earned nearly $18.2 million in 2022, comprising a base salary of $1.5 million, stock awards of $7.5 million, and options of $7.5 million. He also received nearly $855,000 in non-equity incentives and over $811,000 in other compensation. His personal use of the company aircraft cost about $400,000.
Chipotle CEO Scott Boatwright took home $19.1 million with a base salary of $768,461, stock awards of $14.6 million, options of $2 million, and non-equity incentives of $1.6 million.

His use of the company aircraft for personal trips (for security reasons) was worth an additional $338,669.
Ernie Herrman, CEO of TJX — parent company of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, Homegoods, and more — made nearly $23.5 million last year with a base salary of $1.7 million, stock awards of $12.6 million, non-equity incentives of $7 million, as well as $2.2 million in deferred and other compensation.
Yum Brands CEO David Gibbs made over $24.7 million last year with a $1.3 million base salary, plus $9.5 million in stock awards, $3 million in options, $1.7 million in non-equity compensation, and an $8.5 million adjustment to the valuation of his company pension plan.
Outgoing Walmart CEO Doug McMillon made $27.4 million last year with a base salary of $1.5 million, stock awards of $20.4 million, non-equity incentives of $4.4 million, and $1.1 million in deferred and other compensation. Roughly $275,000 of that other compensation was due to personal use of the company aircraft, typically for security reasons.
Laura Alber, CEO of Williams-Sonoma — which owns brands like West Elm and Pottery Barn — took home nearly $27.7 million last year thanks to a base salary of $1.6 million, $16 million in stock, and $10 million in non-equity incentives.
Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol, who took on the role in September 2024, topped the year's list with a signup bonus-enhanced compensation package of more than $95.8 million.
The details include a $61,000 base salary, stacked with a $5 million bonus and $90.3 million in stock awards. He also received $143,567 for temporary housing expenses, $127,765 in personal security services, and $72,398 to fly on the company aircraft between his home and Starbucks' Seattle headquarters.
Niccol's subsequent pay packages, while still large, are set to be a fraction of what he got for his first year on the job.

Nvidia's sterling armor was dented this month.
After years of meteoric success, the chipmaker and its CEO Jensen Huang have increasingly found themselves playing defense — an unusual position for the company.
Nvidia headed into the month with its stock price at an all-time high, bolstered by increasing AI spending from some of its major Big Tech customers like Meta, Microsoft, and Google.
Huang was hot off of Nvidia's GTC conference in Washington, where he dismissed any concerns of an AI bubble and sounded jubilant.
But over the course of the month, which saw Nvidia shed 11% of its value, the chipmaker has gone from smashing earnings and alleviating Wall Street's AI bubble fears to becoming the poster boy of what some analysts view as a company on an unsustainable path.
Nvidia has also had to fend off short-sellers and the growing threat of Google, picking up some bruises along the way.
Big names, including SoftBank and Peter Thiel, cashed out on the Wall Street darling that had became the world's first $4 trillion market cap company mere months ago. SoftBank announced it fully exited its Nvidia position, selling $5.8 billion in shares to bet on OpenAI. And while its CFO stressed it had ""nothing to do with Nvidia itself,"" the move didn't exactly dispel the ongoing AI bubble talk.
Nvidia defiantly pushed back on any investor skittishness when it released its third-quarter earnings on November 19, surpassing analysts' already lofty expectations — no small feat — at a time when concerns about the AI bubble were once again creeping up.
""There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,"" Huang told analysts on a call following the results. ""From our vantage point, we see something very different.""
But while shares rallied in after-hours trading following the results, markets did a U-turn the following day as hand-wringing over ballooning tech valuations and spending continued.
Behind closed doors, Huang privately told employees in remarks first reported by Business Insider that ""the market did not appreciate"" Nvidia's ""incredible"" quarter.
Facing sky-high expectations and the position of being a bellwether for the AI industry, Huang described the chipmaker as being in a somewhat no-win situation.
""If we delivered a bad quarter, it is evidence there's an AI bubble. If we delivered a great quarter, we are fueling the AI bubble,"" Huang said during an all-hands meeting.
It didn't take long for things to get a bit choppy for the chipmaker.
Shares of Nvidia fell after The Information reported that Google was engaged in talks with Meta to provide the social network billions worth of the tech giant's own advanced chips.
While Nvidia's chips have long been the gold standard in the AI race, a hot commodity used by tech giants and startups to train and run LLMs and chatbots, the news suggested that the chipmaker's market share might be under threat. With Google now eyeing Nvidia's lunch, the market digested a possible future where Nvidia may no longer be the star attraction.
Nvidia's market losses following the news appeared to be Google's gain, with its parent company Alphabet now positioned to join the $4 trillion club that Nvidia started.
And in a move that raised some eyebrows, Nvidia released a mostly defiant statement that praised Google's success but said Nvidia's chips are ""a generation ahead of the industry.""
The developments acted as fuel for Michael Burry of ""The Big Short"" fame, who has become increasingly vocal about voicing his doubts about Nvidia.
Burry, who has a particularly dour view of the AI industry, spent much of the month questioning the longevity of Nvidia's chips, its stock dilution, and its circular, ""give-and-take deals"" in AI.
The investor recently leaned into online writing and labeled Nvidia as the Cisco of the AI bubble era in one of his first Substack posts.
""And once again there is a Cisco at the center of it all, with the picks and shovels for all and the expansive vision to go with it,"" Burry wrote. ""Its name is Nvidia.""
The chipmaker didn't take the criticism lying down. In a note to Wall Street sell-side analysts, a copy of which was obtained by Business Insider, Nvidia took exception to Burry's claims, stating that he appeared to have ""incorrectly"" made some of his calculations.
The memo also pushed back against views that Nvidia is too entangled in circular financial arrangements with some of its customers.
""First, Nvidia's strategic investments represent a small share of Nvidia's revenue and an even smaller share of approximately $1T raised each year across global private capital markets,"" the memo said, adding, ""The companies in Nvidia's strategic investment portfolio predominantly generate revenue from third-party customers, not from Nvidia.""
Burry called Nvidia's response ""disappointing"" and disclosed that he ""continues to own puts"" on Nvidia.
While November undoubtedly turned up the heat on Nvidia, the chipmaker continues to be the world's most valuable company by market cap and its shares have slightly rebounded in recent days, closing up 1.37% on Wednesday.
The world's largest tech companies rely on Nvidia's chips and have committed to spend billions and billions on the latest generation. CEO Jensen Huang has said sales of its latest Blackwell chips have been ""off the charts.""
Nvidia's CFO, Colette Kress, told analysts earlier this month that the company is on track to bring in ""half a trillion"" in AI chip orders during the combined 2025-2026 period — a number that she said ""will grow"" as more deals are struck.
While Nvidia's bruising back half of the month is a reminder that even AI royalty can see its crown threatened, Huang had some words for the doubters during the company's earnings call.
""As a reminder, Nvidia is unlike any other accelerator,"" he said. ""We excel at every phase of AI, from pre-training and post-training to inference.""

Apple and Samsung battle across smartphones, tablets and increasingly in the wireless earbuds category where both companies push technological boundaries through annual releases. The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro compete directly with the new AirPods Pro 3Â and matches capabilities in active noise cancellation and AI-powered features that define premium earbuds in 2024.
At $159, down from $249, Samsung’s flagship earbuds undercut Apple’s $249 retail pricing by $90 during Black Friday on Amazon and creates an obvious choice for value-conscious buyers. The decision becomes even clearer for Android smartphone owners who benefit from Samsung’s ecosystem integration that Apple deliberately restricts on non-iOS devices.
See at Amazon
The adaptive active noise cancellation powered by Galaxy AI constantly monitors the environment and changes the strength of the filter on its own, without the need to switch between fixed settings. When you leave the quiet offices and enter the bustling street, the intensity of the noise-cancelling effect changes on its own, and when you enter the restaurant, you are no longer in a bubble. By contrast, the need to switch between different modes on the typical ANC earbuds means you are forced to use the technology in a way that always slightly misses the mark.
The reworked stem-style design and ability to personalize the blade lights help differentiate the product and offer an improved fit over some models in the past lineup, namely the bean-shaped Galaxy Buds, where there was an occasional fit issue related to insecurity when engaging in vigorous dynamic action. The stem style enables leverage, keeping the earbuds in the proper location when running, working out, and engaging in other actions where stemless models are dislodged. The lights help personalize the product through custom color and patterning, reflecting the user’s personality, and making the earbuds themselves rather than the phone the fashion statement.
Sound optimization using the Adaptive Equalizer examines the fit of the earbuds in your ear and optimizes the audio response. In cases where the audio leaks because the fit isn’t tight, the EQ adds bass, and in cases where the fit is tight, the bass reduces because too much would cause muddy tones. These adjustments occur, in effect, on their own when wearing the earbuds.
The Real-Time Interpreter feature functions by facilitating the direct conversation and translation process using the earbuds when interacting with people who don’t speak English, and the translations appear on your phone screen. The use of an AI Real-Time Interpreter feature when traveling internationally gains even less relevance in situations where you need directions, order food, and hold business conversations in foreign languages.
The intuitive touch controls make programming gesture controls available for the functions in accordance with your priorities, rather than adopting the pre-programmed settings provided by Samsung. Customization options include double-tap functionality for triggering the voice assistant, triple-tap functionality for skipping songs, and long press functionality for switching between ANC settings, according to your priority functions.
The IP57 water and dust resistance offered by the earbuds protects against the type of perspired moisture in the gym, rain, and accidental splashes, all accomplished without the fear that typically undermines great-sounding earbuds when they come into contact with moisture, driving up the cost of quality earbuds in the first place. The double warranty on the Amazon product protects against typical replacements, double the typical warranty periods and ensures its quality outweighs the cost upfront.
The Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are available on Black Friday at 36% off the regular price and come with Adaptive ANC, AI sound optimization, real-time translations, customizable controls, an IP57 water resistant rating, and a two-year warranty all in a $159 package. The $90 price gap in the AirPods Pro 3, courtesy of Samsung, means there’s no contest here when it comes to choosing the right wireless earbuds.

Dyson has established itself as the definitive innovator in air management technology and it revolutionized everything from vacuum cleaners to air purifiers through engineering approaches that competitors struggle to replicate. Their hair dryer line applies this same obsessive attention to airflow physics and creates tools that fundamentally differ from traditional blow dryers in both function and results.
At $399, down from $549, the Supersonic Nural represents Dyson’s most advanced hair drying technology available at a record-low price on Amazon for Black Friday. The package includes multiple styling attachments and premium presentation packaging that justifies both personal use and gift-giving applications during the holiday season.
See at Amazon
The Nural designation references advanced sensor technology that measures air temperature 40 times per second, adjusting heating elements to maintain optimal temperature ranges that prevent heat damage. Traditional hair dryers blast constant high heat that dries hair quickly but causes cumulative damage through protein denaturation and moisture loss that leaves hair brittle and prone to breakage.
The intelligent regulation keeps effectiveness while preserving hair structure, and creates the paradox where faster drying causes less damage than slower methods. The system learns your drying patterns and adjusts automatically and reduces heat when you pause or change angles and ramping up when resuming active drying. This adaptive intelligence transforms the dryer from passive tool into active partner that protects hair health during every use.
The digital motor V9 spins at 110,000 RPM while weighing just 27 grams through miniaturization that defies conventional motor engineering. This extreme rotation speed generates the high-velocity airflow that enables fast drying without excessive heat and fundamentally changes the drying equation. The motor positions in the handle rather than the head and creates unprecedented balance that reduces wrist strain during extended styling sessions. Professional stylists and home users both appreciate how the weight distribution enables precise control without arm fatigue that plagues top-heavy conventional dryers.
Air multiplier technology amplifies the motor’s airflow by 3x through aerodynamic engineering borrowed from jet engine development, creating focused high-velocity streams that penetrate through hair to the scalp. This concentrated airflow dries from roots to tips efficiently rather than just moving surface moisture around, reducing total drying time substantially. Thick, long hair that requires 20-30 minutes with conventional dryers often completes in 10-15 minutes.
The included styling attachments address various hair types and desired outcomes through engineered airflow patterns rather than just changing nozzle shapes: The smoothing nozzle creates a wide, flat airflow perfect for straightening while drying, the styling concentrator provides precision for detailed work and the diffuser distributes air evenly for enhancing natural curls without frizz. The magnetic attachment system enables instant swapping without fumbling with clips or threads, maintaining workflow during styling routines.
Negative ion generation reduces static electricity that creates flyaway hair and frizz and produces smoother results that require less finishing product. The ions work at the molecular level by neutralizing positive charges that develop during drying, creating hair that lays naturally rather than repelling itself. This chemistry creates visibly different results compared to non-ionic dryers and reduces the styling product dependence that many users accept as necessary for polished appearance.
The premium packaging and presentation elevate the Supersonic Nural beyond typical appliances into gift-worthy territory appropriate for milestone occasions. The included storage case protects the dryer and attachments during travel while maintaining organization at home. The build quality through materials selection and assembly precision creates an appliance that feels substantial and durable rather than disposable.
At $399, the Dyson Supersonic Nural is going for 27% below retail this Black Friday. Dyson’s hair dryer represents the company’s air management expertise applied to personal care with results that justify premium pricing through tangible performance and health benefits.

Black Friday’s not just the biggest sale day of the year, it’s also the day your home is recovering from the Thanksgiving horde and preparing for the rest of the holiday season. If your old-school upright vacuum and mop or robot cleaner aren’t going to be able to keep up, now’s your moment to make the biggest upgrade possible â to a Dreame robot cleaner.
Dreame’s Black Friday sale is taking up to $800 off the price of their amazingly smart, technologically advanced cleaning machines. If the “technologically advanced” part gives you pause, don’t worry â Dreame’s floor cleaning robots are among the most autonomous on the market, ready to take as much of the cleaning duties out of your hands as you allow.
The holiday season has just begun and has weeks to go. These Black Friday deals from Dreame are your signal to call in the big guns. Let’s check out the five best deals:
With this huge $800-off Black Friday deal, the only shock you’ll get from the Dreame X50 Ultra is future shock, because the X50 Ultra seems like it could have beamed in from years into the future. The X50 Ultra was Dreame’s big drop for 2025, and it remains the undisputed flagship of the Dreame fleet, and possibly the entire sector.
The biggest of many huge leaps forward made by the X50 Ultra is the ProLeap System, a swing arm paired with two sensors that allows the robot to scale steps and thresholds up to 2.36 inches in height. By far the most common human intervention required by robot vacuums is to rescue it after it’s beached on an obstacle, but the X50 Ultra’s ProLeap system and VersaLift Navigation virtually eliminate that need. VersaLift is Dreame’s highly advanced LiDAR system that scans from different heights to give the robot superior mapping and obstacle avoidance abilities. With a clear path charted, the X50 Ultra puts its exceptionally powerful 20,000Pa of Vormax suction power to work, extracting dirt and dust from thick carpets and hard surfaces.
The ProLeap arm isn’t the Ultra X50’s only useful limb. It comes with the revolutionary Dual Flex Arm and MopExtend system that reaches into corners and tight spots for comprehensive cleaning. Once finished, the X50 Ultra heads to the AceClean DryBoard dock for recharging and dirt-emptying, plus a fully-automated hot-water wash, rinse, and heated dry of its mop pads. What’s left for you to do? Sit back, relax, and watch the Dreame X50 Ultra do its thing, content in the knowledge it was your best Black Friday splurge at 50% off.
See X50 Ultra at Amazon
We’re not a fan of sibling rivalries, especially when the big brother is the peerless X50 Ultra. But the L50 Ultra isn’t one to stay in the shadows, not with its stellar array of cleaning power and advanced tech, and definitely not with a $550 price break for Black Friday that makes it an outstanding deal at just $850.
Everything about the L50 Ultra is premium, if perhaps a half-step below the X50 Ultra. But that still ranks it very, very highly on the overall list of robot cleaners on the market. The threshold-beating ProLeap retractable legs and corner-cleansing Dual Flex Arm systems are present and accounted for, along with a stout 19,500Pa of Vormax suction power and a HyperStream Detangling DuoBrush that conquers hair up to nearly a foot long without suffering those work-stopping brush tangles.
Like the X50 Ultra, the L50 Ultra calls the ultra-advanced AceClean DryBoard dock its home, and takes advantage of the 167-degree hot water cleaning for its mop heads and warm-air drying that spares you from the lingering smell of damp, dirty mop heads. The 3.2L dustbag won’t need changing for up to 100 days â between 3 and 4 times per year. AI-aided obstacle avoidance using RGB and 3D structured light and LED path illumination means next to no attention is necessary from you, which is the whole point of a robot cleaner. In any other fleet, this is the flagship. With this Black Friday deal, it’s most definitely not priced like one.

Remember when the mop features on robot vacuums were interesting novelties that functioned far better as conversation pieces than actual cleaning machines? Sure you do, because it was only a few years ago. As the robot vacuum has made enormous strides in technology, the robot mop has followed along. Unsurprisingly, Dreame’s at the tip of this spear, creating the Aqua10 Ultra Roller and its market-setting fresh-water mopping system.
The AquaRoll system sends a continuous stream of clean water through the roller while the dirty water is removed, which keeps the roller fresher for far longer than virtually any other robot mop. FluffRoll technology helps keep it clean with a counter-rotating fluffy roller module, and while many robots have retractable mop heads to protect your carpets, the Aqua10 Ultra Roller has Dreame’s AutoSeal Roller Guard â an automatically closing cover that creates a barrier between the wet mop and your carpets, and also catches the inevitable drips before they reach your carpet.
The Aqua10 Ultra Roller is all about cleanliness â not just of your hard-surfaced floors, but also of itself. The ThermoHub self-cleaning feature uses water heated to 212 degrees â the boiling point of water. The roller module isn’t just cleaned, it’s virtually sanitized. And it wouldn’t be a Dreame machine without a highly advanced navigation system, in this case the Astrovision NVIDIA-powered obstacle intelligence that commits hazards like chair legs, toys, and even pets to memory and remembers them for future avoidance.
Is the Dreame Aqua10 Ultra Roller the best robot roller on the consumer market? It’s certainly at or very near the top of the list. And with a 38% Black Friday deal, it should be at the top of yours as well.
See Aqua10 Ultra Roller at Amazon
The most effective way to clean greasy, grimy, or sticky messes is with heat, preferably hot water. If you’re still stuck in full-manual cleaning mode, that’s adding more steps and more drudgery â heating water, filling a bucket, hauling the bucket, dealing with the dirty water, etc. Dreame’s H15 Pro Heat wet-dry vacuum creates the heat all on its own, with 185 degrees Fahrenheit ThermoRinse cleaning that delivers piping-hot clean water to the mess and puts its heat-resistant spinning brush to work to cut through it and lift it away.
It takes the H15 Pro Heat only one pass to not only tackle the wet sticky messes but also the loose dry debris. (It’s a wet-dry vacuum, after all.) It’s not robotic â although it does have an AI-powered robotic arm that reaches for edges, baseboards, and corners âÂ  so you do have to push, but beyond that, all you need to do is fill its clean water tank before you start and then dump the dirty water tank when you’re done. Place the H15 Pro Heat back on its charging base, and Dreame’s ability to create 212 degrees Fahrenheit boiling water awaits. In a short time, the H15 Pro Heat self-cleans and dries, and with quick recharging, it’s ready to roll out again.
Hardwood- and marble-floor enthusiasts, this one’s for you. The Dreame H15 Pro Heat wet-dry vac takes some of the worst floor-cleaning work off your plate and quickly bounces back for more, and it’s one of Dreame’s better Black Friday deals at just $570.

Stick vacuums aren’t new, and they have a longstanding rep for being affordable and easy to store. However, they also have a longstanding rep for being short on power and not all that effective. Dreame’s Z30 keeps the affordable and easy-to-store parts of the stick vacuum, but adds them to a powerhouse 150,000 RPM TurboMotor that creates 310AW of suction to create a stick-on-steroids cleaning machine.
Interchangeable multi-surface and soft roller brushes are part of the Z30 package, with a deshedding tool that prevents hair and fur wraps from knotting up the brush. The Z30 also adds a formidable brain to its cleaning brawn, with intelligent dirt detection that automatically adjusts the suction power and brush speed based on the amount of dirt it encounters. The LED display at the top of the unit is both your control panel and your readout screen, giving you useful cleaning reports.
The Black Friday market is going to be jammed with stick vacuums, many in that $250 sweet-spot pricing range. But it’s a very safe bet none of them will come with the awesome suction power and smart features of the Dreame Z30.

Philips Hue represents the premium brand in smart lighting where default pricing remains consistently high enough that shoppers wait specifically for Prime Day or Black Friday to make purchases.
At $69, down from $109 (36% off), this 3-pack of white and color smart bulbs costs barely more than a single bulb at regular pricing which runs at $54 individually. This record-low pricing transforms smart lighting from luxury upgrade into practical home improvement that justifies outfitting entire rooms or homes rather than installing single bulbs as experiments.
See at Amazon
The white and color ambiance range lets you control the whole spectrum with millions of color combinations and white temperatures that can be changed from warm 2700K to cool 6500K. This flexibility lets you match the lighting to your activities, moods and times of day instead of being stuck with fixed color temperatures that make you compromise.
The 24-hour natural light scene changes its color temperature and brightness automatically during the day to match the patterns of sunlight. This keeps your circadian rhythm in sync which helps you sleep better and stay alert during the day. In the morning, the light slowly gets brighter, like the sun rising, instead of waking you up with a loud alarm. In the evening, the light slowly gets warmer and dimmer and signals that it’s time to go to bed.
With Hue Bridge integration, you can use advanced features like automation based on schedules or sensor triggers, remote control from anywhere with an internet connection, and rock-solid Zigbee connectivity that doesn’t slow down WiFi networks. The secure, dedicated wireless protocol stops the connection drops and delays that WiFi-based bulbs have when they are on busy home networks. Matter protocol support lets Philips products work with a wider range of smart home systems, making them compatible with other platforms and protecting investments from being locked into a single ecosystem.
Voice control with Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri lets you use natural language commands to control things without having to touch anything. This is easier than navigating apps. This voice integration is especially useful when your hands are full cooking, carrying things or getting ready for bed and you don’t want to have to grab your phone.
Dynamic light effects make subtle animations like slow color changes, breathing pulses, or candlelight flickers that make the lighting more interesting than just being static. These effects turn regular rooms into lively spaces where lighting is more than just a tool. When combined with Hue Sync software, immersive effects that sync with on-screen action make gaming setups better.
These bulbs can be used as main light sources because they are bright enough (800 lumens) for general room lighting, not just accent lighting. The LED technology uses only 9 watts of power while giving off the same amount of light as a 60-watt incandescent bulb. This saves a lot of money on electricity over the 25,000-hour life of the bulb.
This three-for-one price makes it possible to buy premium smart lighting for whole rooms instead of just one bulb.

 As retirement nears, many wonder if their investment portfolios will provide the income they'll need. For most Americans, the bulk of these investments is in qualified retirement accounts, such as 401(k) plans and IRAs. Indeed, while more than 80% of Americans in their 60s are invested in retirement plans, only about 35% have brokerage accounts.

 That leaves us to wonder: How much is the average stock portfolio for people in their 60s?

 While only a minority of Americans in their 60s hold taxable brokerage accounts, those who do often have meaningful balances outside their 401(k)s and IRAs. The Federal Reserve reports that for households ages 55–64, the median balance of directly held stocks is about $30,000, and the median balance of pooled investment funds held outside retirement accounts is about $300,000. For ages 65–74, those medians land at about $65,000 and $250,000, respectively. Together, they suggest a typical taxable portfolio for older investors falls in the low- to mid-six figures.

 Industry data tell a similar story at the upper end of the spectrum. In Charles Schwab’s latest Self-Directed Brokerage Account Indicators report, self-directed brokerage windows inside workplace retirement plans averaged about $362,000 overall in the second quarter of 2025.

 Baby Boomers (ages 61 to 79 in 2025) held the largest balances, averaging about $599,000, while the Gen X investors (whose oldest members started reaching 60 this year) averaged about $379,000. These figures skew toward more engaged investors but offer a realistic upper-end benchmark.

 You can also get a sense of where you stand by looking at what's typical for defined-contribution retirement accounts, such as 401(k) plans and IRAs at Vanguard:

Note that the averages are quite a bit higher than the medians (i.e., the 50% midpoint). This is because a small number of very large accounts will skew the average upward. For most Americans, the median is a better number to use.
 Fidelity also reports average IRA balances, and it is not uncommon to have both a 401(k) from work and also contribute individually to a traditional or Roth IRA. The average in Fidelity accounts for Baby Boomers is $257,000 in 2025.

 If the median is one-third that amount, as it is for 401(k) balances reported by Vanguard, then we can reasonably estimate that average retirement savings for those in their 60s is about $500,000 to $550,000, with a median of around $180,000.

 Vanguard's data tell us that 64% of 401(k) assets held by Americans 55 to 64 are held in stocks, but that drops to 50% for those 65 and over, which is unsurprising as risk tolerances decline with age.

 If we assume that about 60% of a typical 60-something’s retirement portfolio is in stocks—which is in line with many target-date funds for this age group—that implies an average stock balance of around $300,000 and a median stock balance of a little over $100,000 in retirement accounts.

A reminder that a 401 (k) or IRA is designed for long-term retirement savings, and most people only access the money decades later because withdrawals are restricted and often taxed or penalized. A brokerage account works very differently: it’s a flexible, taxable account people use for regular investing, trading individual stocks or exchange-traded funds (ETFs), or building a portfolio they can tap at any time. In all these accounts, you might own stocks, even if indirectly through mutual funds or ETFs.
 While only about a third (36%) or so of Americans in their 60s have a brokerage account, fewer (29%) report owning stocks. While that's a minority of those who are invested in a retirement plan, it is worth investigating the value of these stockholdings.

 The Federal Reserve provides average figures, but they can be pretty misleading, as there are a few extraordinarily large accounts (the largest in the data have over $1 billion in holdings). But if we cut out the outliers at the 1% and 99% part of the range, we get a more realistic picture of Americans in their 60s:

 Benchmarks like the averages and medians reported above are useful, but they’re not a pass/fail test. To assess your own portfolio, here are some helpful tips:

10,2025-11-27,"When it comes to PCs, Westerners are most most familiar with x86/x64 processors from Intel and AMD, with Apple Silicon taking up a significant market share, too. However, in China, a relatively new CPU architecture is on the rise. A fabless semiconductor company called Loongson has been producing chips with its LoongArch architecture since 2021. These chips remain rare outside China, but some in the West have been benchmarking them.
[Daniel Lemire] has recently blogged about the performance of the Loongson 3A6000, which debuted in late 2023. The chip was put through a range of simple benchmarking tests, involving float processing and string transcoding operations. [Daniel] compared it to the Intel Xeon Gold 6338 from 2021, noting the Intel chip pretty much performed better across the board. No surprise given its extra clock rate. Meanwhile, the gang over at [Chips and Cheese] ran even more exhaustive tests on the same chip last year. The Loongson was put through typical tasks like  compressing archives and encoding video. The outlet came to the conclusion that the chip was a little weaker than older CPUs like AMD’s Zen 2 line and Intel’s 10th generation Core chips. It’s also limited as a four-core chip compared to modern Intel and AMD lines that often start at 6 cores as a minimum.
If you find yourself interested in Loongson’s product, don’t get too excited. They’re not exactly easy to lay your hands on outside of China, and even the company’s own website is difficult to access from beyond those shores. You might try reaching out to Loongson-oriented online communities if you seek such hardware.
Different CPU architectures have perhaps never been more relevant, particularly as we see the x86 stalwarts doing battle with the rise of desktop and laptop ARM processors. If you’ve found something interesting regarding another obscure kind of CPU, don’t hesitate to let the tipsline know!
Remember how Removed by Reddit broke thousands of Iran’s centrifuges by doing hacking on hardware level? If you connect chinese CPU to your electricity or network connection don’t be surprised if in 10 years all your data is keylogged and available for puchase on Weixin.
OK, I’ll bite.  And you believe that these CPUs can secretly – and undetectably – somehow transmit information over… power lines.. ?   Also – why would anyone be interested in your key logs? I’m assuming you must be quite important for people to bother trying to snoop on your activities.  In fact, I’m surprised you’ve taken the time out of your important busy schedule to comment on a Hackaday article.
The CPU’s themselves probably won’t do that, but in order to be able to use them you need a MB, and TPM/etc are more or less ubiquitous, so it would be quite sensible to assume there are remote control functionality.
Whether it’s “better” to give remote access to China vs the US is another question.
There is a school of thought that suggests part of the reason Huawei gear got banned was because the western security services couldn’t hack it.
Good point, indeed. Are western chips made by, say, intel (US) any safer, though?
Seriously wondering. As far as rumors go, about every US software/device has backdoors and spyware for the three letter agencies.
And that ISPs have mandatory blackboxes connected they have no idea what they’re really doing.
It’s really confusing to figure out who’s the good guy/bad guy considering these (old) stories.
I still remember when Intel had serial number function added into Pentium 3 CPUs.
Gratefully, the European Parliament had intervened at the time.
The US apparently had no issue with it back then, so why should it have now?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_III#New_features
I’d be very surprised if the NSA isn’t able to load its own microcode into Intel CPUs. We have photos of them intercepting US hardware, installing backdoors, and shipping it on to customers.
I’ll take my chances with Loonsong. More worried about my own government than the Chinese one.
Intel’s embedded Management Engine has a kill switch for when the machine is ordered for government usage. Shows how much they trust it.
AMD equivalent to Intel ME is “AMD Secure Technology”. It is always running in the background.
Here’s the thing everyone seems to overlook with this though. Install all the covert sneaky data infiltration features in the chip you want. In the end it all still needs to cross the network interface on it’s way back to home base.
If these chips were doing this stuff firewalls will pick it up and flag it.
Motherboards can also snoop network traffic if the on-board NIC is used, even if the computer is “off”.
Some intel chipsets run a custom copy of Minix inside the chipset, for example.
It’s basically a computer in the chipset..
Same ways, the UEFI firmware can run in background and operate behind the operating system’s back.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Management_Engine
https://itsfoss.com/fact-intel-minix-case/
https://www.zdnet.com/article/minix-intels-hidden-in-chip-operating-system/
I’m waiting for the day when western and eastern gremlins in our chips fight another directly.  Then the only duty we still have is to pay the power bill for that silly war!
Humans just suck!
And in most cases that won’t be a problem – if you are putting in dubiously trustable computers at the edge you are likely putting them in at every stage along the network too.
Plus there are plenty of ways to get data out more directly from the compromised machine – for instance a bit of mesh networking like behaviour out of the inevitably inbuilt Bluetooth or wireless antenna. Your router and network filters don’t matter at all then, and odds are it will be next to impossible to detect as there is so much traffic in those bands, quite likely some of your smartphones will be acting as data smuggling relays without the user even knowing etc.
so we should build multi cpu system with few intels and some chines cpus, lets see who will gets whom :D
i really enjoy how explicit this comment is that we should not trust the chinese supply chain because the western supply chain has been infiltrated by the CIA / Mossad
Hahaha yes, the irony didn’t escape me either
I’m going to say China doesn’t have a license for x86,”x64″.  What kind of grey area would it be if it could run native RISC or ARM code and with a tightly bound software x86 layer run code.  Then it could be sold worldwide.
I’m curious about the platform this is plugging into.
On the software side with FEX debuting on the Steam Frame are we approaching a nexus where ARM will run older programs well enough for most purposes?
Seperate note, I was on the Framework site and they have RiscV motherboards for their laptop, not sure how I missed it.  They hasten to note this is beta/tinkerer level support.  But at least it’s a real polished laptop on the hardware side.

As someone who’s in front of the screen for several hours a day, six days a week, I can tell you just how important a good-quality chair is. You’re not just sitting on it; it’s providing your upper and lower back, plus arms, the support they need so you can keep working comfortably.
As you’d expect, the best options on the market don’t come cheap. On a regular day, you can expect to pay over $300 for a top-rated option from a known brand. Thankfully, that changes today. Right now, you can grab the Razer Iskur V2 X ergonomic gaming chair for just $250, after a nice 17% discount on its retail price of $300.
It’s a Black Friday deal, and the offer applies to both black and dark gray color options. The discount, however, ends soon, so it’s best to bag it as soon as you can.
See at Amazon
The fabric is cool to the skin and smooth to the touch. Thicker cushion padding molds to the unique shape of your body, while the breathable, multi-layered fibers prevent sweat and moisture buildup during those longer, intense work and play sessions.
The wide seat base is sculpted with reduced edges that distribute the pressure around evenly, which prevents soreness in the buttocks and thighs. It also promotes healthy blood flow, so you won’t have to change positions every few minutes to keep those uncomfortable numbness or tingling sensations away. There’s an integrated lumbar arch that encourages a neutral sitting position with lower back support, because it’s high time you start taking your posture seriously. We don’t mean to creep you out, but Tech Necks don’t just look awkward; they can lead to long-term spine damage and nerve pinching if you don’t make necessary adjustments.
Of course, sitting upright for longer hours can get tiring. To tackle that, the Razer Iskur V2 X has an adjustable recline of up to 152 degrees. Stretch out a bit, and use this mode for relaxing gaming or streaming sessions that don’t require intense focus.
Arms get a break, too. The 2D armrests can be adjusted in height and rotated inwards or outwards for a neutral position. When typing long documents, adjust the height to match your desk and keep them in the outward position for proper arm and wrist support. Planning to relax with a quick gaming session? Pull them inwards for a bit more stability with the console.
The chair is available in two color options, so you can pick whichever suits your aesthetics the best. Go for the black one for a cleaner, classic look. Like your gaming setup with a bit more personality? The dark gray version is going to upgrade the overall look instantly!
This gaming chair does not come pre-assembled, so you’ll need to put it together yourself. The process is straightforward (instruction manual included), and should not take more than 30 minutes. If you’d rather skip the hassle, you can get professional assembly through Amazon for an additional $100. To wrap it up, this Black Fridy deal brings the price of this ergonomic gaming chair down to just $250, after a nice $50 discount. It’s great for gamers, work professionals, creatives, and even casual users looking for better support as they use their PC or laptop. It ends soon, though, so it’s best to grab yours before the price goes back up, or the stock ends for good.

His line, 'Do you think the stock market is beyond the realm of human possibility?' inspired me, and I knew I had to give it a try. I made $300 on my first trade with a $ 1,800 account, despite not really knowing what I was doing. That's a 16.67% gain. I was hooked. I lost it all shortly after, but the love had set in. 
It took me five years to become consistent and profitable. The first two and a half years were spent just learning.

17,2025-11-27,"Three men have been arrested in dawn raids following a BBC News investigation into organised crime gangs operating on the High Street.
Two Iranian men aged 32 and 28 were arrested after immigration officers targeted multiple addresses in Birmingham and the West Midlands. The Home Office said the third man was a naturalised British citizen aged 43.
They are being held on suspicion of facilitating illegal entry to the UK and facilitating illegal working.
Earlier this month, the BBC found more than 100 mini-marts, car washes and barber shops operating from Dundee to south Devon, were linked to a crime network.
Andy Radcliffe, Assistant Director from Immigration Enforcement, is leading an investigation into the BBC's allegations involving HMRC, the National Crime Agency, Companies House, police forces and Trading Standards.
An investigation was ""immediately launched"" after the BBC's report, he said, with teams building ""an intelligence picture in the matter of a few weeks"".
Mr Radcliffe added this was just the start of the investigation ""to try and tackle the widespread abuse"".
""We're taking this very seriously...people could go to prison for this, we could take assets off them, so we're taking it very seriously,"" he said.
Earlier this month, the BBC revealed evidence of criminal networks organising and profiting from undocumented working in barber shops, mini-marts and carwashes across the UK.
The Home Office launched an ""urgent investigation"" involving police forces across the country after the BBC uncovered more than 100 businesses linked to a suspected Kurdish crime network enabling migrants to work illegally and sell counterfeit cigarettes in High Street mini-marts.
The BBC investigation found an asylum seeker, who says his claim was rejected, trying to sell a mini-mart for £18,000 cash.
Undercover reporters also exposed a man at the centre of an immigration crime group who said he had ""customers in every city"" and could wipe illegal working fines worth up to £60,000.
Loose regulation of Britain's labour market is acting as a pull factor for those entering the UK illegally, the government has acknowledged.
Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said these kinds of criminal networks ""create an incentive for people to come here illegally"".
Questioned by the BBC, last week, on whether the government has lost control of High Streets to Kurdish organised crime gangs, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: ""What your reporters were able to scrutinise and show is absolutely evidence of why our system is broken.
""It's why this government has been cracking down on illegal working.""
In the Budget, the chancellor announced funding for 45 new Trading Standards officers.
Rachel Reeves said the government would be undertaking ""additional enforcement activity on High Streets, focusing on illicit tobacco and vaping products"", which would involve deploying 350 newly-recruited criminal investigators part of the fraud investigation team.
Minister for Migration and Citizenship Mike Tapp praised the BBC investigation and its reporting saying ""really it shows the value of the BBC"".
On a government level, he said: ""We said we take it seriously and we have and we are.
""I hate what these, you know, hairdressers, nail bars and dodgy vape shops are doing to, so many of our high streets, not just for the look and feel of them, but also for those genuine businesses that are being undercut. So it's really important that we continue to work hard to combat this.""

18,2025-11-27,"Many Gen Zers doubt the value of a degree, but Elijah Khasabo is finding it indispensable to his entrepreneurial career."
19,2025-11-27,"Japanese beer giant Asahi revealed on Thursday that a massive cyber-attack in September has potentially leaked the personal information of more than 1.5 million customers.
The drinks company published a statement on its investigation into the ransomware attack, which had crippled its operations across its factories in Japan and forced employees to take orders by pen and paper.
Asahi said it found that personal details of people who had contacted its customer service centres were likely exposed and that those affected would be notified soon.
The firm added that it would delay the release of its full-year financial results to focus on dealing with the fallout of the attack.
Asahi did not state the attacker's identity or demands. Ransomware group Qilin - which has previously hacked other major firms - had claimed responsibility for the Asahi attack.
The beer maker said in its preliminary findings that it discovered a disruption at one of its data centres on 29 September.
It said that although the system was quickly isolated, investigators found the attacker had already infiltrated the network, encrypted its data and deployed ransomware - a virus that blocks access to files until a ransom is paid.
Some data in the affected computers, along with personal information stored in the hacked servers, were also potentially exposed, said Asahi.
The only confirmed cases of data exposure involved 18 items of employee-related personal information, which were stored on company-issued laptops, Asahi told the BBC.
All other personal information involved is regarded as being at risk of possible leakage, it added.
It includes personal details of more than 1.52 million customers, specifically their names, gender, addresses and contact information.
Data belonging to about 107,000 current and former employees and 168,000 family members of staff were also potentially leaked.
The name and contact details of 114,000 external contacts that had communicated with the firm were also linked.
Credit card details were not included in Asahi's list of leaked data.
The company added that it has not confirmed any evidence of the data being released and that the impact of the attack is limited to systems managed in Japan.
The firm also owns big brands in Europe like Peroni and Fuller's Brewery in the UK. Asahi has said that the operations of those firms have not been impacted by the cyber-attack.
The company said it spent nearly two months containing the attack and is now working to restore systems and reconfigure its network.
The outage resulted in drink shortages in shops across Japan. Asahi accounts for around 40% of the country's beer market.
The shortage also affected Asahi's soft drinks, such as ginger beer and soda water.
Shipments are also gradually resuming, said Atsushi Katsuki, the firm's president and chief executive, who apologised for the difficulties caused by the disruption. 
""We are making every effort to achieve full system restoration as quickly as possible, while implementing measures to prevent recurrence and strengthening information security across the group.""
Other global brands have also recently experienced similar cyber-attacks.
Jaguar Land Rover was forced to tap emergency funding after a major cyber-attack crippled operations at its British factories.
From 10 December, social media firms must ensure Australians aged under 16 cannot have accounts.
The attack on Kensington and Chelsea Council is understood to have also hit two other London councils.
Nicknamed the Bom, the country's weather agency has been heavily criticised over a recent redesign.
A woman, in her 80s, was taken to hospital after the incident in a Devon village on Tuesday.
They argue the law - which will block users under 16 from having social media accounts - is unconstitutional.

TRANSCRIPT:
INTRO: Too much information running through my brain, Too much information driving me insane
Investors have long been taught that fundamentals drive stock prices. Revenue, growth, and profits, as Benjamin Graham taught us in the short run. The market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it’s a weighing machine.
But what if it isn’t? What if narratives are driving market valuations? I’m Barry Ritholtz, and on today’s edition of At The Money, we’re gonna discuss how to identify when market narratives overtake fundamentals.
To help us unpack all of this and what it means for your portfolio, let’s bring in Ben Hunt of Perscient. Ben’s firm studies, narratives, and the stories that shape markets investing and social behavior through the lens of information theory. So Ben, let’s start with a definition.
Barry Ritholtz: How do you define a narrative in the context of markets and investing?
Ben Hunt: Let me define it.
So it’s, it’s a simple definition. A narrative is an answer to the question why. Why did the market go up today? Why should you buy this stock? Why should you sell this stock? Why should you vote for this person? Any answer to the question, why is a narrative?
Barry Ritholtz: How do you distinguish between something like data, which I arguably comes with a storyline attached to it and just a straight up, Hey, Bitcoin is millennium or digital gold?
Ben Hunt: How do you define the difference between this, I guess this stock is cheap with a PE of nine is a narrative. Yeah. Well, why is, why is a PE of nine cheap? Or why is a PE of three cheap or 15 cheap? These are all stories, Barry. Any, any, any valuation, any multiple, any meaning that you attach to numbers?
It’s a story. It’s a, it’s a, it’s an answer to the question. Why? Why do I call it cheap? Why do I think you should buy it? Why is this interesting? Those are all why questions and the answer. Are all narratives.
Barry Ritholtz: How do you identify any particular narrative that may be driving a particular stock or asset class or the overall market? What, what tools do do you use to help discern that?
Ben Hunt: Lemme start by saying what I don’t care about. So what I don’t care about is truth or accuracy. I mean, it sounds crazy, but
Barry Ritholtz: Not at all. ’cause you’re trying to figure out what the crowd believes. Yeah. Whether it’s true or not. Well, if it affects their behavior, it matters.
Ben Hunt: I’ve given up on trying to figure out what reality is. What I’m trying to figure out is how is reality being presented? How is it being presented to us? So what I’m looking for are elements of presentation. I’m looking for word choice. I’m looking for how loud is it being presented to you, how frequently it’s being presented to you.
But most of all, I’m looking for a concept that you talk about in network math, and it’s called density. I’m looking for how the language is connected to other words. In fact, those are the, the measurements you use in network math. Those are where they, we talk about betweenness, we talk about connectedness and centrality. Those are the measurements, because I’m looking at the presentation, not at the reality.
Barry Ritholtz: So how do you measure density? You, you hinted at some of it. How loud it is, how repetitive it is. How do you tell when a specific narrative is beginning to exert influence over prices?
Ben Hunt:  Bob Schiller wrote a pretty good book, a a couple years back called “Narrative Economics,” and the takeaway from that book is that you should think about and understand narratives in exactly the same way.
You think about and you understand disease, I mean, you, you use the same measurements. You remember when we were talking about COVID, it was or R-not? How, how fast does it spread? How quickly does it spread? What is the medium in which it can spread most easily? It’s exactly the same thing here, it’s exactly the same thing.
We’re really using exactly the same math. As you would use to try to understand epidemiology and the spread of a virus. So what we’re looking at though, instead of the atmosphere or wastewater, we’re looking at the words. We’re looking at all the words that are out there in terms of text of what’s being written, what’s being said.
This is all unstructured data, and we’re looking for the presence of certain ideas, clusters of words that spread through that medium of media in exactly the same way that a virus spreads through the air or through the water. If you’re a financial advisor or you’re a market person of any sort, and somebody comes up, why’d the market go up today?
And you could say, well. There are a hundred different reasons, but basically it was just variance. You know? It’s just, it’s just, it’s just
Barry Ritholtz: A random walk. People. Hate that answer, by the way.
Ben Hunt: People hate that answer ’cause it’s a crappy story. It’s a story. It may be true, but it’s not compelling. Exactly. It’s not truthy. Right. It doesn’t, it doesn’t connect with you. It’s like, well that’s disappointing. I, I want a story so. The stories that are basically there to fill the time. Uh, and these are, these are typically examples where I call ’em descriptive narratives.
They’re, they’re answering the question why, but they’re describing why something happened.
Barry Ritholtz: Always after the fact. Never in advance.
Ben Hunt: Always after the fact. That’s exactly right, Barry. So what you’ll find is that, I don’t know, it’s earning season and who comes out first with earnings. Financials, right. Citi and Goldman Sachs, whoever, they’ll report some good earnings. The stocks will go up and afterwards, Cramer and everyone else has gotta tell you why.  And they’ll say, “Oh, I’m bullish on financials.” And they’ll give you a reason.
And the half life for that sort of narrative, it’s a week or two.
You wanna do with that? Honestly, is you wanna fade it. You wanna look for that to appear in your Bloomberg email in the morning saying, oh, market experts bullish on financials because blah, blah, blah. And when that drum beating gets pretty loud when it’s appearing in your morning email. I wanna fade it.
You don’t wanna press it, you wanna fade it because this is, this is just the, the ordinary business of Wall Street. You’ve gotta have an answer to why, it’s almost usually just variance or some combination of idiosyncratic stuff. But you’ve gotta come up with some blanket “Why?” And if that gets a lot of play, I want to go the other way.
There’s another type of narrative though, where I want to press it. That’s what we call prescriptive narratives. It’s not saying, “Oh, the Fed is dovish.” It’s saying, you know, Muhammad Elarian will come out, or, uh, I don’t know. Trump will come out and say, “The Fed should be dovish.”
You see the difference? It’s not, it’s not describing what’s already happened. It’s trying to. Lay the framework for what should happen.
Barry Ritholtz: So let’s delve into that. What sort of tools are you using to identify these narratives? Be they descriptive or prescriptive? How, how much lead time do you get, uh, to analyze, you know, this giant corpus of noise and commentary and data that is produced every single day?
Ben Hunt: This is what good traders, honestly  and investors have always done. They’ve, they’ve, they’ve always made these sort of assessments of the news and the stories that are happening. So this, what we’re trying to do is we’re trying to externalize what good traders, and I’ll call it short-term investors, have always done, they’ve always internalized this so.
Anybody can do this. You start looking for the words that are trying to prescribe versus describe, uh, that’ll you, you can, you can pick this up in whatever you do. What we are able to do though today is because there’s now big data is because there’s big compute, is we can read everything. Humans we’re all limited in what we can read, what we can pay attention to in our little corner of the world.
What’s possible today is to read everything and to analyze exactly this sort of word choice.
Barry Ritholtz: What sort of output do you get from your “Big Compute” that’s scraping everything sifting through all the language; does it identify specific words? Does it identify themes? I’m assuming artificial intelligence and big data analytics is a key part of this. What does the output look like to you?
Ben Hunt: Well, lemme start with where it starts, because it’s not that the output comes from what you. Put into it and what you wanna put into it, and this has to be human generated, are, well, what are the ideas, what are the narratives that I care about?
Here’s why that’s important: Let’s say you’re a value investor, you’ve got a vision, you know, you’ve got a view on a stock and like all value investors, you think the market has not recognized the story about this stock that I think is really important.
So what you’re looking for is not, how loud is that story right now? That story is dormant. You’re looking for that story to start being told. So you can’t start this from asking AI, “Hey, AI, what are the prominent stories right now?” Because it can only tell you what’s being spread right then and there.
The way to really make money with narratives, is to say what narrative is dormant today, I wanna see when it starts to get discovered.
Its that discovery phase when the market quote unquote, wakes up to a story that you’ve been looking for the market to wake up to. That’s how I find you can most reliably make money from narrative investing.
Barry Ritholtz: I get the sense we’re still in the early days of narrative investing as a key strategy, at least in terms of using AI and big data. What do you see developing in this space? What’s the narrative about narrative investing?
Ben Hunt: This is an old idea. So if you, if you go back and kinda look at your Wall Street history, or if you talk to kind of traitors today, what they’re always looking at is the news that comes along and they’re trying to say, Hey, do I fade that? You know, is that story worn out? Is it, is, is that, is it topping over or does this story have legs?
Is this the start of, its spread like a virus? It’s an old idea, what’s possible today is to quantify it. What’s possible today is to externalize what good traders have internalized in the past. It’s not that it’s, inventing cold fusion or really doing anything that’s new in the world. What it is able to do is to make that sort of analysis, to look at not what reality is, but how reality is being presented and make it available over a much wider scope, not over just that little area that the Good Trader really knows a lot about and make it available over a lot more publications and things that are being written because humans can’t read everything really.
I think it’s a way of, I hate to call it democratizing investing. I really hate that idea. But it really is a notion of creating a new instrument so every investor can understand, well, what are the stories that are being told about the world today?
Barry Ritholtz: To wrap up, technology has enabled us to read much more than we were capable of reading as individuals. In fact, the machines can read everything and we can use those machines to identify dormant narratives that might lead to increases in either a particular stock or asset class or market. Fair statement?
Ben Hunt: Very fair. What you’re looking for is what’s new, what’s changed, because when the narrative changes, that changes behavior.
Barry Ritholtz: Fascinating stuff. I’m Barry Ritholtz. This is Bloomberg’s At the Money.

Thanksgiving brings a welcome surprise as LEGO’s most popular Christmas set returns to Amazon inventory after two weeks of complete stock depletion that frustrated holiday shoppers. At $25, down from $39, the Santa’s Sleigh building set hits a Black Friday price that likely removes LEGO’s profit margin entirely as they race to clear seasonal inventory before Christmas passes and demand evaporates.
The aggressive pricing reflects LEGO’s urgency to move remaining units rather than holding stock that becomes instantly obsolete on December 26th. With over 30,000 units already sold and limited time remaining before the holiday, this inventory replenishment at record-low pricing creates the optimal purchasing window.

The 343-piece count gives builders a lot of time to build, about 2 to 3 hours for experienced builders and even longer for kids working on their first multi-hour LEGO projects. This piece count strikes a good balance between being fun and easy to use. It has enough pieces to keep kids ages 9 and up happy without overwhelming younger builders with too many pieces that make them angry.
The Santa minifigure and four poseable reindeer figures that come with it let kids act out Christmas Eve delivery scenes instead of just looking at static displays. The saddles can be taken off and decorated, which lets you personalize them. The eight wrapped gifts that can be built also give you props for storytelling which makes the toy more fun to play with after it’s been built. The guitar, skis, and teddy bear accessories hint at certain story elements, but they also leave room for people to use their imaginations to figure out whose gifts these are and where Santa brings them.
The sleigh is 3 inches high, 11.5 inches long, and 2.5 inches wide which makes it a great holiday decoration that doesn’t take up too much space on mantels or shelves. The size is perfect for showing off on fireplace mantels, entry tables, or holiday vignettes without needing special furniture. LEGO’s precise manufacturing tolerances guarantee that the structure will stay strong even when it is handled carefully and stored once a year.
The set works just as well as a hands-on gift that the recipient puts together themselves or as a decoration that the gift-giver puts together before giving it. Kids who get the unbuilt set get to build it and use it at the same time while adults who get pre-assembled sets like how they look right away without having to spend time building them, which they may not have during busy holiday seasons.
Because it’s seasonal, the set naturally follows a pattern of being displayed in December and then packed away with other holiday decorations. This way, it stays fresh each year instead of becoming stale decorations that are always there. This cyclical use makes the perceived value last longer by building up excitement around yearly unpacking traditions that kids look forward to along with other holiday traditions.
LEGO Santa’s Sleigh comes with 343 pieces, a Santa mini-figure, four reindeer and the ability to display Christmas decorations. LEGO’s zero-margin seasonal clearance pricing combined with restocked inventory after 2-week depletion creates the optimal moment to secure this popular set before final sellout.

Following the launch of Gemini 3 with advanced capabilities across video, reasoning, and coding, Google is now the talk of the town in the generative AI category. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently admitted that the Gemini team had done a great job with the launch.
Even NVIDIA, which has also been flying high due to the high demand for chips to foster AI advances (unlocking $4 trillion in market capitalization), recently indicated that it is delighted by Google's success (via Tom's Hardware).
But perhaps more interestingly, the chipmaker used the opportunity to toot its own horn: ""Nvidia is a generation ahead of the industry — it's the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done. Nvidia offers greater performance, versatility, and fungibility than ASICs, which are designed for specific AI frameworks or functions.""
This news comes after reports claim that Meta is currently in discussions with Google to rent its Cloud Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) in 2026, and even potentially buy them in the subsequent year. Consequently, Alphabet (Google's parent company) and Meta's stock prices saw a significant increase. However, NVIDIA's stock price dropped by 3%.

Google's Cloud TPUs are quite different from NVIDIA's AI GPUs. For context, the former's offerings are designed to help with AI model training and inference, while the latter are designed for parallel processing, allowing them to handle billions of calculations simultaneously.
While speaking to CNBC, a Google spokesman indicated:
“We are experiencing accelerating demand for both our custom TPUs and Nvidia GPUs. We are committed to supporting both, as we have for years.” During NVIDIA's earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang addressed the rising TPU competition, indicating that Google is the company's customer for GPU chips and that Gemini can run on its technology.

Flicking through multiple screens. Checking the markets at 1 a.m. Trading from the bathroom stall at work.
Being a day trader isn't easy — particularly if you're a trader who still supports yourself with a regular 9-5 day job — people living the life told me after work at a day trader happy hour in New York's Financial District.
The event, hosted by trading education and mentorship company BullMentor, is a relatively new phenomenon, but it's gaining popularity as a growing number of people pursue what they see as a more modern version of the American dream: to one day quit their jobs and support themselves primarily by trading the market.
That simply isn't the reality for most day traders, many of whom are in the red or only quasi-profitable. While many claim their ultimate goal is to trade full-time, fewer than 40% of traders report being able to do so, according to a survey conducted by the trading company Quantified Strategies this year.
Five people, many of whom walked into the bar still dressed for the workday, told me about the arsenal of strategies they had developed to manage the stress of living their double life, which frequently conflicts with work hours. Their playbook largely revolves around automating trades, capitalizing on their office's work-from-home policy, and, among the most determined traders, waking up in the dead of the night to try to lock in some gains before they have to get up for work.
Melissa Avutan, the CEO of Bull Mentor and a day trader who worked in analytics, said she believed the best approach was what she calls a ""set-it-and-forget-it"" method. In a typical day, she'll do research during the premarket and purchase 1-day option contracts or set stop losses on specific trades, which automatically sell a position to avoid further losses.
Avutan, who has been trading for around two years, said she believed it was ""insane"" to try to trade minute-by-minute during work hours, though she's aware of some people who do so and think they can manage the stress. She suspects most who do so are unprofitable.
Kevin Law, a 44-year-old trader who works in investment banking, said he employs a similar strategy. He'll open short positions in the morning, go back to work, and then try not to check the markets until the following day.
He also tries to keep his expectations low, and says his biggest pro-tip is not to get greedy when making trades.
""I just try to make lunch money,"" he said, adding that he was satisfied if he made as little as $30 a day.
It can be hard to hold a position without being able to check your portfolio. One trader at the event said he lost $1,800 on a stock because he was stuck in a work meeting.
Matt Brown, a 33-year-old trader in the financial services industry, says he tries to ""prep"" the night before by doing market research, so he's ready to pounce on opportunities in the morning before work.
""I think it's more about being organized and just being disciplined,"" he said of his schedule, though he lamented having to let go of certain opportunities due to being at work. ""It's very much patience and something I struggle with.""
Steven Lin, a 30-year-old trader who works in financial regulation, said he frequently traded the Tokyo and Shanghai markets for several hours in the evening after his day job. Occasionally, he's also traded in the London market, which begins around 3 a.m. New York time.
If he's trading US-listed stocks, it's only a proper trading day on Mondays and Fridays, the two days of the week when he's able to work from home, he said.
Lin says balancing it all can be stressful.
""If you think about it, there is no other way out,"" he said. ""I want to start a family. I want to buy a house. So basically, you're going to have to grind to get to that point. I don't think a day job is going to cut it.""
Overnight trading is also gaining popularity. The number of US stocks traded overnight has about doubled from September 2024 through June of this year, according to data from the New York Stock Exchange.
Ricardo Saldana, a 29-year-old home health aide, says his second job as a trader begins around 12 am. He'll attend to patients in various households from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., nap until midnight, and then start researching the market in Europe and Asia. He'll trade from around 3 a.m. to 8 p.m. before going back to work.
He makes up for the lack of sleep by sleeping in on Fridays, which is his day off from trading.
Saldana said he tried trading during the workday in the past, but it hasn't gone well. When he was doing an internship for a financial company, he ducked into the bathroom in spare moments to execute trades on his phone. Over several months, he blew around $100,000, a loss that took him several years to recover from.
""You can't just have different distractions going on,"" he said.
Friends and family think his schedule is strange, particularly since he doesn't tell anyone he's a trader. Many in his life doubt his dream of achieving financial freedom in the markets, one reason he keeps his trading under wraps.
""It's a grind. Hopefully it turns into something where I don't have to be a health aide anymore,"" he said.

Anker ranks among the major players in portable power stations and it competes directly with EcoFlow, DJI, and Jackery through engineering and pricing strategies that constantly push competitors to respond. This Black Friday reveals Anker’s aggressive positioning as the Solix C1000 (gen 2) delivers the strongest value proposition in its price bracket.
At $349, down from $799, this 2,000W power station undercuts rivals attempting to match Anker’s pricing by offering 300 to 500 watts more output capacity (they offer on average between 1,500 and 1,800W) than competing models at identical costs. You’re getting more power for the same money alongside Anker’s proven reliability built through years of dominating the phone charger and power bank markets.
See at Amazon
The constant 2,000W (3,000W peak) is able to handle everyday household appliances such as fridges, microwaves, space heaters, and heavy machinery with high energy requirements. This level of power helps distinguish genuine portable power stations from batteries posing as generators. It provides genuine assistance in a blackout situation, rather than just charging phones. It can handle furnaces, preserve chilled food, and function medical equipment, for instance. The 3,000W surge rating includes the peak startup currents of compressors and pumps to prevent circuit breakdowns due to startup currents.
It takes 49 minutes to go from empty to full with an AC wall plug. This is a significant upgrade over previous charging stations, which required 6â8 hours, putting you in a precarious situation during the fleeting periods of restored power after a storm. This charging capability alone makes Solix a better pick than slower competition out there in the market.
The battery chemistry provides for 3,000+ cycles and retains over 80% of the original capacityÂ which is about a 10-year lifespan with moderate use and significant degradation only later on. LiFePO4 is an improvement over the common lithium-ion battery because of increased heat resistance and lack of potential risks of flames with abuse. There is a sophisticated battery management system with monitoring of voltage, current, temperature, and prevention of overcharge, discharge, current, and short circuit protection.
With a 1,024Wh energy storage capability, one can run necessary appliances during a blackout without resorting to a costly and enormous energy system. A full-sized refrigerator can be powered for 16 hours, a laptop will be charged for 15 cycles, and an LED light will be able to function for an extended period of days with a single charge. This specific location provides an optimal solution among other locations with regard to being useful, portable, and affordable without being too small or too large.
Supporting multiple outputs for many devices AC outlets, USB C, USB A, and the DC outputs accommodate charging a variety of devices, from large appliances to smaller devices. This means you won’t need a variety of power banks. The pure sine wave AC output is important because it prevents sensitive devices such as a computer from being damaged by dirty power.
For only $349, the Anker Solix C1000 packs 2,000 watts of continuous power, 3,000 watts of surge power, a 49-minute recharge, 1,024 Wh LiFePO4 battery and numerous outputs, which is 56% off what it would normally cost on Black Friday. Anker’s increased output for a similar price makes it the best value among portable power sources available in the market today.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sriram Ramkrishna, a 56-year-old job seeker in Portland, Oregon, who worked at Intel for over two decades cumulatively, most recently as a senior community manager and developer relations professional. He is among the thousands of Intel employees who have been laid off this year. Business Insider has verified his past employment and layoff documentation. This essay has been edited for length and clarity.
In July, I was laid off by Intel — for the second time.
Although I was given a few weeks' notice to land a new role within the company, I didn't try too hard to find one. After my second time around at Intel, part of me felt it was time for a new adventure — even if I knew the job market could be challenging.
I started casually looking for work right away, but I wasn't too stressed about it, as my wife and I had built a financial cushion over the years.
However, on July 31 — my last official day at Intel — my wife also lost her job. With both of us out of work, my mindset shifted from ""I'll find a job when I can"" to ""I'd better find a job.""
I first joined Intel as a software engineer in 1996, shortly after graduating from college. I spent the next 20 years at the company until 2016, when I was laid off for the first time.
After a difficult 16-month search, I managed to find an engineer job at another company, but in 2022, I was laid off again.
As I searched for work, a role at Intel came onto my radar. However, I was of two minds about returning; many of us who were laid off in 2016 were deeply frustrated by how the job cuts were executed and how we were caught off guard. But I needed a job, and wasn't in a position to pass up opportunities.
I eventually was offered a developer relations role and accepted it.

Three years later, my second Intel layoff forced me to start the job search process all over again.
I first became aware that my job was in jeopardy in June, when my unit was informed that our group was being dissolved. We were told the company would spend the rest of the month shopping our work to other business units, but if they couldn't find a fit, we'd lose our jobs.
In early July, we learned that there was no fit and that we had about three weeks to try to land another role within Intel. Otherwise, we'd be given a severance package and laid off.
One of the first things my wife and I did was take a vacation we'd already booked to Europe, tacked onto an industry conference I was attending.
During the trip, I started poking around job boards and did a few interviews that came through recruiter reachouts on LinkedIn. My goal was to get a feel for the job market. I thought it didn't seem too bad for the types of roles I was interested in.
When my wife and I returned from our travels in late July — just a few days before my last day at Intel and when she was let go — I felt rested and ready to focus on my job search.
Despite my initial optimism, the past four months of my job search have been challenging. I've landed some interviews, but I've either been rejected or ghosted afterward.
I think I'm in a better position this time around, compared to after being laid off in 2016 — at least in some ways.
In 2016, it had been 20 years since my last interview, whereas I just went through a job search in 2022 before rejoining Intel. I also had a less defined career identity before, but it's now clear that I'm a developer relations person, which makes it easier to target the kinds of roles I'm looking for.
However, what's particularly challenging about my current job search is the competitive nature of the market. If an employer I'm interested in posts a job, there's bound to be at least 400 applicants. I've had to find a way to stand out, especially when going through the front door doesn't feel like a viable option.
One way I've been trying to do this is by optimizing my résumé keywords for applicant tracking systems using ChatGPT and a career firm that I was given access to as part of my Intel severance package.
But I know that's not enough, so I've also been relying on my network. Through conferences and past connections, I've been invited to private developer relations Slack channels and Discord servers, where I've connected with others in my field. Some have job channels where I can connect directly with hiring managers who post openings. I've also been trying to use referrals and connections to land interviews.
One of the things that has kept me going is the support of my former Intel colleagues who also lost their jobs. Many of us have been helping each other with our job searches and sharing opportunities.
Through my network, I've helped some former colleagues get interviews. These folks were young and recently graduated, and I felt an obligation to help them as it was their first layoff.
It feels like we're all looking out for one another. When I got laid off in 2016, I didn't have the same kind of support. This time, it's been different, and that's been really amazing.
Intel provided a healthy severance package, which has been helpful. However, with both my wife and me out of work, it's become more challenging.
It'll be a while before I start panicking about finances, but I definitely want to secure a job by early next year.
I'm hopeful I'll land something by then, but if not, I might more seriously explore tech roles in Europe, where I think there will be growth in opportunities due to investment in the industry. Going forward, I plan to keep monitoring the Slack and Discord groups, and continue attending networking events and job fairs.
I think a lot of the search will come down to luck and timing.

29,2025-11-27,"Happy Thanksgiving—it’s a great day for food, family, and football (not necessarily in that order), and it means that Black Friday deals are already arriving. We’ve been tracking discounts on our favorite products all month, and we’re excited to see that many of the products are on sale.
Like the circulars that once made today's daily newspaper as thick as a phone book, the internet is slathered in red pixels and slashed-through dollar signs. Often, those roundups cover products the writer has never actually used and include items that aren't actually discounted. WIRED’s list of the absolute best Black Friday deals is different. Here you will only find products that a member of our Reviews team has tested and recommends. Also, we track prices, and any deal featured is actually cheaper compared to what you’d pay in a few months.
Thanksgiving Day afternoon update: Hope you’re having a great holiday. After lots of food and semi-forced socialization, perhaps it’s time to get some fresh air? We’ve added deals on Bluetooth speakers and fitness devices. And if you’re instead thinking maybe it’s time to just call it a day and head to bed for a tryptofan-induced slumber, we’ve also added some sleep deals.
How does WIRED find the best deals?
We spend our entire working lives testing products and, in part, tracking how much they cost. That way, we can spot a good deal from one that's just a markdown of an artificially inflated price (a practice far too common, sadly). We also use price-checking tools like Camelcamelcamel, but since we only cover items we've actually tested, it's not that hard for us to keep track of prices and know what's a good deal and what's not.
What is the best time to shop?
In a word: now. The best Black Friday deals are happening right now, and we've rounded up our favorites in this guide.
In the olden days, Black Friday was just one day long. Shoppers would camp outside of stores, paper circulars in hand, eagerly awaiting the chance to bust down some doors and save a ton of cash. Fast-forward to the internet, and now Black Friday lasts more or less the entire month of November.

Finally, a $500 Windows laptop that isn’t just decent or mediocre, but actually good. The resolution is 2560 by 1600, with decent color accuracy and brightness.

The M4 MacBook Air came out in early 2024, and it’s remained the best laptop you can buy. The price has slowly dropped, too. It’s now down to $749, and when you compare this directly with the quality of similarly priced laptops, you’ll see why it’s still at the top of my list. The display quality and resolution is top-notch, while the performance and battery life remain best in class. Now, you might be wondering if you should wait for the M5 MacBook Air instead of pulling the trigger on this deal. If the rumors are true, we’re still at least a few months out from the M5 MacBook Air, making this M4 still worthy of a purchase at this price. —Luke Larsen

Not to mention this is one of the first flagship Android phones with Qi2 magnets, meaning, like Apple’s iPhones, you can magnetically attach the phone to wireless chargers and docks for speedy charging (and attach various fun magnetic accessories). Best of all is Google’s smart software; yes, there’s a lot of generative AI creep that isn’t super useful, but tools like Call Screen can filter out spam calls, and Now Playing automatically tells you what song is playing at the coffee shop without you having to lift a finger.

In our guide to the Best Air Purifiers, WIRED contributor Lisa Wood Shapiro notes this means the filter can last up to five years, as opposed to six to 12 months like a typical HEPA.

Note that Birdfy only works with 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, and the base model comes without a solar panel.

But last year’s Series 10 (Apple’s 10th anniversary watch) has the same S10 chip as the latest watches.

30,2025-11-27,"The Forerunner 570, Venu 4, and Instinct 3 are more reasonable to buy at these deal prices.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Garmin has released an excellent lineup of fitness watches this year. The downside is that Garmin has raised its prices across most lineups, making 2025 the most expensive year yet to get the best features. And given Garmin's current stock struggles, I wouldn't be surprised if prices keep climbing next year to appease stockholders.
We gave the 2025 Garmin watches — the Vivoactive 6, Instinct 3, Forerunner 570, Forerunner 970, Venu 4, Venu X1, Fenix 8 Pro, and Bounce 2 — generally glowing reviews. But my fellow reviewers and I had to acknowledge how expensive they all were, with mid-range models priced like flagship watches and the most expensive ones costing as much as a great smartphone.
Black Friday (temporarily) solves this, bringing the prices down to what they would have cost if Garmin acted like other smartwatch brands and treated upgrades as the norm, not an expensive add-on perk. In particular, the $100-off Forerunner 570 is an excellent deal, bringing the price down to what its predecessor originally cost.
The Garmin Forerunner 570 is a fantastic running and multisport watch. Compared to the excellent Forerunner 265, its AMOLED display is 0.1 inches larger and twice as bright, you get a distinct aluminum bezel instead of plastic, and its next-gen HR sensors are more accurate with skin temp included. 
It only weighs 3g more than before despite adding a mic & speaker for calling, and you get new software perks like a Triathlon coach and evening report. For most Garmin fans, most of the upgrades are nice to have, but not essential, so this Black Friday deal will make the upgrade more tempting.
Likewise, it's much easier to recommend the Instinct 3 AMOLED now that its price has fallen to $399 ($100 off). As much as its sporty design and up to 24 days of battery life will appeal to die-hard Garmin fans, its price was a bit too high considering you don't get ""unlimited"" battery life or offline maps. Now, it matches the Instinct 2 series' original pricing, while giving you new perks.
You can choose between a 1.2- or 1.3-inch AMOLED display with excellent battery life or months of battery life with the MIP version, with its upgraded Solar panel that turns time outdoors into extra lifespan. I prefer AMOLED, especially since Black Friday ensures the visual upgrade doesn't cost extra.
Otherwise, upgrading from the Instinct 2 Solar to the Instinct 3 series nets you perks like dual-band GPS accuracy, a built-in LED flashlight, training load focus, running form analysis with a gyroscope, grade-adjusted pace, and the latest Sleep Coach with nap detection and breathing variations.
 



My last deal highlight is for Garmin's weirdest watch of 2025: the Venu X1. It's my favorite to wear because it's so incredibly comfortable, weighing just 40g with the nylon strap and measuring an absurd 7.9mm thick, while giving you a 2-inch, 2,000-nit display that makes maps and other features look fantastic. It's really hard to recommend at the original $800 price, but at $200 off? I think it's a great value, and a better choice than the $849 Fenix 8.
The Garmin Venu X1 is a unicorn in the 2025 lineup, with the casual squircle style to appeal to Apple fans but the hardcore fitness hardware you'd normally pay Fenix money to get, like topographic maps, ClimbPro, Endurance/ Hill scores, and running tolerance. Basically, it's designed to blend in more than other bulky Garmin watches, without compromising on training tools.
Its 8-day battery life and all-systems GNSS aren't top-tier by Garmin standards but are still respectable for most athletes, and you get the upside of a design that's much more comfortable for sleep tracking and more readable in everyday life. Again, it's hard to recommend at its original price, but I could make its $200-off price work for my budget.
This only scratches the surface of all the Garmin watch deals available for Black Friday, but in terms of 2025 Garmin watches, I'm genuinely surprised at how tempting these deals are.

YouTube megastar MrBeast said he's gearing up for what he calls ""ultra grind mode"" — a pledge that places him squarely in the growing hardcore worker moment, reshaping both the creator economy and corporate America.
In a post on X on Wednesday, the 27-year-old creator, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, told his 33.4 million followers that he hasn't been fully satisfied with the quality of his latest videos.
""After some reflection, I just want to say I think some of our newer youtube videos haven't been as good as I wanted. I apologize,"" MrBeast wrote. 
""Ya boy is going to go into ultra grind mode and make the greatest content of my life in 2026. Promise,"" he added. 
The X post, which quickly garnered more than 2.9 million views as of Thursday morning, triggered a wave of encouragement from fans, who insisted his standards were already impossibly high.
But MrBeast doubled down.
When one commenter told him not to be so hard on himself, MrBeast replied: ""Appreciate it but I'm going to take this stuff to a whole new level.""
MrBeast's pledge mirrors a broader shift inside big companies, where bosses are dialing back talk of work-life balance and leaning into performance, presenteeism, and discipline.
Executives like AT&T CEO John Stankey and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy have pushed employees back to the office five days a week and tied careers more tightly to measurable output.
In a memo to AT&T managers in August, Stankey told staff the company is moving away from ""familial cultural norms"" toward ""a more market-based culture — focused on rewarding capability, contribution, and commitment."" 
Meanwhile, Amazon CEO Jassy has slashed layers of management, toughened performance reviews, and reinforced Amazon's  demanding culture.
Career experts say that in this landscape, staying employed means showing up, documenting wins, and proving how you drive results — not just how long you've been around.

35,2025-11-27,"The 570 normally has a perplexingly high price tag, so this deal is a pleasant surprise.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Retailers have started launching fitness smartwatch deals for Black Friday, including Amazon, which chopped $100 off the Garmin Forerunner 570. While this smartwatch normally seems pretty expensive for what it has to offer, $100 in savings should help make it seem a little more justifiable.
The 570 has multi-band GPS tracking, Bluetooth connectivity, 8GB of storage, and other standard sensors such as an accelerometer, an altimeter, a compass, and a gyroscope, along with Garmin's latest Elevate sensor. The main omissions on the Forerunner 570 include the lack of an ECG sensor, offline maps, and an LED flashlight, while the bulkiness makes it less than ideal for sleep monitoring use. However, it's still a pretty solid Garmin watch beyond those, especially for those seeking a wide range of running and fitness features, coaching plans, and more.
This particular Black Friday Garmin deal is for the 47mm version of the watch, featuring the slightly larger 1.4-inch AMOLED display. It also boasts a slightly better battery life than the 42mm configuration, offering up to 11 days in smartwatch mode or up to 18 hours in GPS-only GNSS mode.
Garmin Forerunner 570 (47mm): $549.99 $449.99 for Amazon's Black Friday sale
The Garmin Forerunner 570 is a particularly expensive watch in the mid-range category, though it's currently available for $100 off as part of the Black Friday sale at Amazon. From active workout suggestions to customizable coaching plans and GPS, the watch boasts just about everything buyers today need in a fitness-focused wearable.
✅Recommended if: you're a well-seasoned runner or workout enthusiast and you want a discount on one of Garmin's mid-range watch options; you prefer a large AMOLED display, even if it's a little bulkier than smaller models; you're looking for something with advanced fitness options but you don't want to pay the premium on a Forerunner 970.
❌Skip this deal if: you're looking for one of the best Android smartwatches on the market and you have the budget to upgrade; you're really new to running or other workout activities and you don't want to have to sift through the 570's many advanced options and modes; you need a smartwatch with an ECG sensor.
The Garmin Forerunner 570 is a great smartwatch for most runners, but it definitely bears repeating that it doesn't have an ECG sensor built in. Still, if that doesn't bother you, you'll likely find what you need in the watch's other features, including Garmin's latest Elevate sensor, an Sp02 sensor, an accelerometer, an altimeter, and gyroscope, and a range of multi-band GPS and satellite tracking hardware.
Many buyers like the colorful, sporty designs on the 570 models, and the large AMOLED display included on the 47mm configuration. It also comes with 8GB of storage, Bluetooth, NFC, and a built-in speaker, in addition to Garmin's Morning and Evening Reports.

This is the best time of the year for a multitude of reasons. Not only does family get together to celebrate and watch football, but it also means that Christmas is right around the corner.

Samsung resolved many issues we had with the Galaxy Z Fold 6, as the Galaxy Z Fold 7 looks and feels more like a true flagship foldable phone than ever before. And now's your chance to save a few hundred bucks to feel like you're living in the future. 
Price comparison: Best Buy - $1,599 | Samsung $1,599
✅Recommended if: You want the latest, greatest, and thinnest foldable that money can buy.
❌Skip this deal if: You're on a budget, or you would prefer a foldable phone that still includes stylus support.
After years of releasing iterative updates to its flagship foldable phone, Samsung went back to the drawing board with the Galaxy Z Fold 7. What we got was the thinnest foldable on the market, and that includes devices released abroad like the Honor Magic V5 or Vivo X Fold 5.
While Samsung went in-house with the Exynos 2500 on the Galaxy Z Flip 7, the company stuck with Qualcomm for the Fold 7. As such, we have the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy at the helm, which is paired with up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. This top-spec model is also on sale for $400 off as part of the Black Friday festivities.
With the Galaxy Z Fold 7, not only did Samsung introduce a completely overhauled design, but we also got a long-overdue camera upgrade. Samsung finally ditched the 50MP wide-angle lens from years past in favor of a 200MP sensor. This is joined by a 12MP ultrawide lens and a 10MP telephoto sensor with a 3x optical zoom.
In fact, the 200MP camera is the same sensor that you'll find in the Galaxy S25 Ultra, which is an enormous upgrade. If you're interested in seeing how the Z Fold 7 performs, we compared it to the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and the Pixel 10 Pro Fold.
In our review, we gave the Galaxy Z Fold 7 a 4.5/5 star rating, making this an easy recommendation for anyone who is interested in picking up one of the best foldable phones.

37,2025-11-27,"You can't go wrong with the high-quality audio from Sonos.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Black Friday is basically here for Amazon and other retailers, which is why we're starting to see a cornucopia of Bluetooth speaker deals go live. For instance, Amazon's Black Friday Week sale has chopped $100 off the Sonos Move 2 Bluetooth speaker, which is our pick for the best-sounding Bluetooth speaker out there for Android users.
This is the second generation of the Sonos Move speaker, and the company launched this one with improvements to battery life, connectivity, and sound quality overall. The Move 2 comes with a USB-C port for charging, though it also comes with a convenient charging stand for the first time in the company's history of audio products.
To be sure, the Move 2 is much larger than many of today's Bluetooth speakers, and while it does have a handle, it's not quite as portable as some with more stowable shapes and sizes. Still, if you don't need it to be super small, it might be worth considering, especially if you want something that can achieve rich bass tones, crisp vocals, and a broad frequency range backed by a high-performance, precision-tuned woofer.
Sonos Move 2 Bluetooth Speaker: $499.00 $399.00 for Amazon's Black Friday Week
Amazon has chopped $100 off the price of the Sonos Move 2 speaker for Black Friday, bringing the price of what is our favorite Bluetooth speaker from an audio quality perspective down to just $399. If you're looking for something tiny and portable, this probably isn't the way to go. However, those in need of a truly powerful stereo speaker should get what they want out of the Move 2, especially at this low price point.
✅Recommended if: you're looking for a really good sounding Bluetooth speaker that offers stereo audio; you want a speaker with an easy-to-use mobile app and connectivity features; you want a speaker with an ingress protection rating for water and dust resistance.
❌Skip this deal if: you're looking for a really small, portable Bluetooth speaker and you don't care about having industry-leading audio quality; you want a speaker with hi-res Bluetooth codecs; you want a speaker that has access to Google Assistant.
The Sonos Move 2 is the best-sounding Bluetooth speaker for Android users on the market, even if it's a little less portable than other options. It offers both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity, and it comes with a built-in handle, making it easy to carry from one place to the next.
The Sonos app also makes it easy for users to set the speaker up and connect to other devices using Wi-Fi, while most newer devices will also recognize the Move 2 from their own interfaces. Additionally, the Sonos Trueplay tuning features adaptive sound for a multitude of environments, meaning that it will tune the audio to your surroundings when listening.
While Google Assistant is not available on the Sonos Move 2 due to legal disputes between the two companies, it does offer other voice assistants, including the first-party Sonos Voice Control and Alexa.

38,2025-11-27,"As attractive as the Lego Star Wars UCS Death Star is, we just can't justify spending $1000 on a single set.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

How much is too much for one of the best Lego Star Wars sets? Up until last month, the most we'd ever spent on a Lego Star Wars set was $849.99. That was an eye-watering amount, but with the release of the new Ultimate Collector's Series Death Star in October, it's just gone up even higher. If you want to own this exclusive collector's piece, you're going to have to part with $1,000. Yeah: a grand on a Lego set. It's a fantastic set, no doubt, but has Lego gone too far this time?
Judging by the reviews on the official Lego website, the answer to that may well be 'yes': of 214 reviews, 33% of them are one-star. We have a feeling they're not from actual buyers; however, simply people making their thoughts known about the price. But they have a point: one thousand dollars could buy a lot of things more important and useful than a Lego set. It also isn't currently on offer for Black Friday despite there being many models discounted.
For collectors, though, there's no doubt the Death Star is a tempting prospect. Measuring 28 by 32 inches, it's huge, and with a whopping 38 minifigures, it's really quite something. Unusually for a UCS set, the focus is on the interior, with the set providing a cutaway diorama of everything going on inside the Death Star. It's split into multiple rooms, each providing its own scene that Star Wars fans will recognize from a key part in the movies. There's the trash compactor, Emperor Palpatine's throne room, a hangar with an Imperial Shuttle and a whole lot more. In fact, several of the dioramas have had their own entire set. And here, they're all together in one place.
As good as it is, though, we won't be buying the Lego Star Wars UCS Death Star. As much as we love Lego Star Wars, it's one set that won't be gracing our collection any time soon, and here's why.
 



One thousand dollars. Honestly, we'd expect to be able to buy our own room in the actual Death Star for that. To a lucky few people, though, $1,000 is pocket change. For them, heading down to The Lego Store to pick up a UCS Death Star is nothing more than picking up a candy bar in the supermarket. For most of us, though, that amount of money is several months' worth of disposable income. It's rent. It's our electricity bills for half the year.
Not to put too fine a point on it, things are tough right now and unless you’re absolutely flush with spare cash, it feels a little irresponsible to be throwing so much money on one Lego set. There are a lot of things that you could buy with $999.99, and who knows when something more urgent or life-dependent is going to come up.
And how about the fact that there are so many other great Lego sets that cost just a fraction of the price of the Death Star? Take the Acclamator-Class Assault Ship, a set we rated 5 stars. You can buy twenty of them for the price of one Death Star. We also thought Grogu with Hover Pram was a pretty great set. You can have ten of those. An army of ten Grogus, or one singular Death Star. Your choice.
Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!
 



For $999.99, you'd expect a huge set. That's exactly what you're getting with the Lego Star Wars UCS Death Star, but for many of us, it's going to be too big. It's 28 by 32 inches, so you're going to need a huge shelf to display it on. If you live in a small home and you're limited for shelf or worktop space, you can forget about it.
In the same amount of space taken up by the Death Star, you could display several other smaller sets. Smaller sets that will undoubtedly cost a fraction of the price of the Death Star, too. In fact, some of the dioramas included in the Death Star can be bought as their own sets: both the Throne Room and the Trash Compactor were released as standalone sets (with a lot more detail than you'll find in the Death Star) for less than $100 each.
There's also the fact that, despite its price and its size, the UCS Death Star is not a full set. Unlike the previous (and now retired) Death Star, this new model is not spherical. It's merely a cutaway of the inside of the Death Star. And while it's nice to get more interior detail, it doesn't provide enough detail to really understand the full scale of the actual Death Star model. Perhaps that's for the best, because then it really would be far too huge for most people's homes. But it's still a shame that we're only getting a slice of it.
 



The draw of the Death Star for a lot of Lego Star Wars collectors will undoubtedly be that it's a UCS set. The Ultimate Collector's Series has been around for over 20 years and focuses on big, detailed sets designed to be displayed rather than played with.
Many UCS sets do carry a premium price tag, but the Death Star is the highest by a long shot. It's almost 18% more expensive than the next most expensive set (the Millennium Falcon, which costs $849.99 — and since that has been around for eight years, it's often available at a discount). We can't help but feel that Lego is testing the waters to see just how much money fans are willing to spend on one set.
Look at the available Lego Star Wars UCS sets and you'll find plenty of great-looking display models available for substantially less than the Death Star. The Lego X-Wing Starfighter, which we rated highly in our review, costs $239.99, and thanks to a wealth of detail, it's a stunning set to have on display. It takes up much less space than the Death Star, too, making it appropriate for collectors with a smaller area to display in.
 



Even Jabba's Sail Barge, with an expensive-enough price tag of $499.99 and an impressive 31-inch length, is half the price of the Death Star. This is a set that comes with 11 unique minifigures (including a large molded model of Jabba the Hutt), a fully-detailed interior and a huge scale model that is going to take pride of place in any Lego Star Wars collection. Perhaps Jabba's barge isn't as iconic as the Death Star, but given that you can buy this and still have $500 left over, it feels like a no-brainer to us.
Of course, your own opinion of the Lego Star Wars UCS Death Star will vary. For us, our thoughts are very much driven by the price: as much as we love Lego, a thousand dollars on one set feels like a step too far. Do we wish we had more disposable income so that we could buy it without worrying about the cost of it? Perhaps — but even then, we can't help but think there'd still be something more worthwhile we should be buying instead.

Gaming laptops usually cost over $1,000 for basic performance and high-end models can easily reach $2,000 to $3,000 for complete gaming capabilities. However, this Asus TUF gaming F16 laptop (RTX 4050, 512GB SSD, 16GB DDR5 RAM, Intel Core 5 chip) breaks this trend with a price of $749, down from $1,099. This deal on Amazon for Black Friday offers real gaming hardware at an all-time low.

The Nvidia RTX 4050 laptop GPU with a maximum TGP of 115W delivers true 1080p gaming performance in modern games: It uses DLSS 3 technology to upscale images and keeps high frame rates while keeping visual quality intact. The ray tracing support creates realistic lighting effects in games like Cyberpunk 2077, Forza Motorsport and Control without slowing down frame rates, thanks to AI-assisted rendering.
The GPU can run esports titles such as Valorant, League of Legends and Counter-Strike at competitive frame rates over 144fps, matching the display’s refresh rate. Creative tasks like video editing, 3D modeling and AI image generation also benefit from GPU acceleration and greatly speed up rendering times compared to integrated graphics.
The Intel Core 5 210H processor provides balanced power through an efficient hybrid design that includes performance and efficiency cores. This setup manages demanding tasks while conserving battery life and gaming sessions experience steady frame rates as the performance cores focus on game logic and physics, while efficiency cores handle background tasks without detracting from gameplay.
The 16-inch FHD+ display has a 144Hz refresh rate and a 16:10 aspect ratio, and offers an immersive gaming experience through smooth motion that avoids the stuttering of standard 60Hz displays during fast actions. The taller ratio adds vertical space, which is useful for productivity tasks like coding, document editing, and web browsing, where having more vertical pixels reduces the need to scroll. The display achieves 100% sRGB color accuracy and ensures correct color representation for photo editing and other creative work beyond gaming.
The cooling system is equipped with Arc Flow Fans, four exhaust vents, five dedicated heat pipes, and anti-dust filters and keeps temperatures steady during long gaming sessions without too much noise. This thermal design prevents performance drops caused by overheating to ensure consistent frame rates during extended play. The anti-dust filter keeps internal dust build-up in check, which helps maintain cooling efficiency over time, extending the laptopâs lifespan compared to systems that quickly degrade in dusty conditions.
At $749, this Asus TUF laptop offers a great mix of true gaming performance and sturdy build, and at this price point, it offers outstanding value in the gaming laptop market.

42,2025-11-27,"Rural small towns today might be shaped by Dollar General stores and rusty industrial plants, but many across the US were once lively brick-paved main streets where domestic manufacturing and tight-knit communities flourished.
Some of America's small towns have grown in recent years, with young people moving in, while others that prospered a century ago now lie abandoned.
By the mid-century, declining industries began shaping what is now known as the Rust Belt, where once-booming iron, steel, and automobile plants were abandoned as manufacturing industries moved overseas.
But before the economic turmoil, small towns across the US were home to close communities, quaint main streets, and the first automobiles.
In some villages and small towns, like Normal, Nebraska, the bank was a building smaller than a house. In Hugo, Oregon, the high school was the size of a midsize church.
Take a look at what small towns looked like 100 years ago.
Between the early 1900s and the 1940s, Oatman and nearby Gold Road were Arizona's biggest gold producers, and the town used to be a bustling center with over 10,000 inhabitants.
When 2020 census data was collected, it had a population of 102 people.
Today, the ""lively ghost town"" is defined by its streets of historic buildings, burros on the streets, and people wearing old-timey clothing and gunfighter costumes, as reported by Legends of America.
The town was founded in 1881 and was named for O.H. Manning, a politician.
The town of 1,500 is about 2 miles long and 2 miles wide, and its Main Street was paved in 1915, a community website reported.
Eastman was established in 1855 and was named for Ben C. Eastman, a member of Congress from the district.
More recently, the town has a population of 350, according to 2020 census data.
The town was annexed in 1919 to become a part of the nearby city of Lincoln.
In 1927, President Calvin Coolidge took a ""working vacation"" to South Dakota's Black Hills to get a break from the hectic politics of Washington, DC, and win over rural populations, The Rapid City Journal reported.
The president's visit was supported by the expansion of the air mail service, which helped communications from the small, remote town, Vermont Public reported.
The town of Boothbay Harbor was incorporated in 1889 and became a trading and shipbuilding center.
Today, the coastal town's main industries are boat manufacturing, fishing, and tourism, according to the Boothbay Harbor Chamber of Commerce.
The town was established on land taken from the Cheyenne and Arapaho people. According to the Oklahoma Historical Society, at the end of the 19th century, a general merchandise store with a post office was established nearby. The name of the town honors a postal employee, Wayne W. Cordell.
In 1905, a prospector found gold, and within a year, its population had reached 4,000, Travel Nevada reported.
Today, about 125 people reside in the town, and residents often refer to their community as a ""living ghost town,"" per Nevada's state tourism agency.
Although the town had enjoyed decades of prosperity due to the resources provided by Grasshopper Creek, by the 1930s, few residents remained.
In the following decade, the local school had to close down due to a lack of students, effectively turning the once-prosperous town into a ghost town. It is now part of a state park where dilapidated buildings are preserved.
Gold was discovered nearby in the mid-1800s.
Today, the town of 2,500 features a revitalized downtown area for tourists to visit, according to the town's website.
In 1925, a Dayton high school science teacher, John T. Scopes, was tried and found guilty for teaching Charles Darwin's theory of evolution in what became known as the Scopes Trial.
The discovery of gold in the county in the 1850s brought families to the area. The school opened in the 1890s and closed in 1967, according to its alumni Facebook page; this aligned with the trend of schools closing in rural towns in the mid-20th century, as populations moved to cities and amid school consolidations and reforms.
Farmers discovered they could make money from people leaving the city, and hotels and guest houses popped up throughout the town.
The town was home to 210 residents during the 2020 census.
In 1914, the Provincetown Art Association and Museum was founded by a group of prominent local artists. They worked with local businesses to create an art collection and educate the public in the arts. 
The town is known for being the 1620 landing site of the Mayflower.
The town was named after Edward S. Crossett, a lumber entrepreneur.
The town ""had all the ingredients for a lumbering town,"" as reported by the Washington County Historical Society. The town features rivers connecting the small community to the pine forests of northern Minnesota and Wisconsin, and still waters that allowed for the raft assembly industry to flourish locally.
In 2011, Forbes named it as one of America's prettiest towns.
Holy City was created not as a religious oasis, as the name would indicate, but instead as ""a commune and tourist trap created in the 1920s by a white-supremacist huckster,"" the San Francisco Chronicle wrote.
The Chronicle also reported that Holy City was reduced to ""a few derelict buildings"" after facing fire, neglect, and a new freeway that cut off the compound from major roads. 
Mercury News reported in 2016 that the town was purchased after a decade on the market by Robert and Trish Duggan, billionaire Scientologists. 
Historians estimate that the ancestors of the Taos Pueblo people built their living structures, as well as pottery and ceremonial buildings, as far back as 1000 AD, according to Taos.org.
The Native Alaskan populations remained isolated until the early 1800s, per Wrangell's website. 
Lt. Dionysius Zarembo, a Russian-American ship commander, landed on present-day Wrangell in 1833. It is the only city in Alaska to be ruled by four nations and under three flags — Tlingit, Russia, England, and the United States — according to the town's website.
Today, the town is a historic site tourists can visit and see over 20 original restored buildings, per Wyoming History.

If buying from a trusted brand name is at the top of your shopping process, you’ve just found your source for the best Black Friday deals on vacuum cleaners and home cleaning robots. Eureka has been synonymous with top-level vacuum cleaners since 1909, with untold millions of units sold and over a century of satisfied customers and clean homes to their credit. Eureka’s Black Friday 2025 deals are here, with amazing discounts on five of Eureka’s top manual and robotic vacuum cleaners.
Was: $450 Now: $300 (save 33%)
Eureka entered the robot vacuum market in 2023 with the E10s, which was an instant hit as a highly effective and cost-friendly floor cleaner. Over 100,000 Eureka E10s are keeping floors clean worldwide right now. For the 2025 holiday shopping season, Eureka’s upped the ante significantly with the E20 Plus, which is a spectacular Black Friday deal at just $300 from now through Dec. 1.
All of the labor-free perks of the E10s are present in the E20 Plus, with significant upgrades in cleaning performance, anti-tangle capability, and obstacle avoidance. The E20 Plus brings 8,000Pa of suction power to bear on debris and dust particles both large and small, a 100% upgrade on the previous model. It uses multi-cyclonic separation technology to separate 98% of dust and dirt before it reaches the filter, not only extending the lifespan of the filter, but also to prevent the bagless base station from getting clogged.
The mop unit of the E20 Plus lifts by 10mm to keep your carpets clean and dry after the E20 Plus has given your hard-surfaced floors a thorough cleaning, and whether it’s working on carpet or hard floors, the advanced DuoDetect AI 3D Obstacle Avoidance technology that debuted in the Eureka E20 greatly reduces the need for human intervention to get the vacuum unstuck. A dual-line laser acts as the robot’s eyes, dynamically sensing obstacles well in time to steer away from them and continue its cleaning without interruption. The E20 also comes with enhances night-vision capabilities, which also come in handy during daytime so the unit can go under beds, sofasm and other lifted furniture.
For pet owners, the new anti-tangling brush design will come as a true relief, as anyone who’s had to wrestle with the chore of cutting hair and fur knots out of vacuum rollers knows. The v-shaped rubber roller brush of the E20 Plus improves anti-wrap effectiveness and significantly reduces hair tangles.
You can take 33% off the regular $450 price of the Eureka E20 Plus, bringing home a top-tier robotic vacuum and mop for just $300.
See Eureka E20 Plus at Amazon
Was: $700 Now: $490 (save 30%)
If you’ve come looking for sheer, brute cleaning force, look no further than the Eureka J15 Ultra. This Black Friday deal brings you an incredible 19,000Pa of suction power, industry-best ScrubExtend mopping power, hair tangle-eradicating FlexiRazor technology, and more for just $490, a 30% markdown from its regular $700 price.
The J15 Ultra is all about power and efficiency, with an all-in-one self-emptying base station that also cleans the mop heads with hot water to eliminate tough stains and then dries them completely with 131-degree hot air to prevent musty, damp odors. The ScrubExtend feature kicks in when the J15 Ultra encounters baseboards, corners, and table or chair legs, delivering cleaning coverage to 98.95% of the area around those edges and obstacles. As the mop is working, any worries that it won’t perform as well as old-fashioned elbow grease are set aside, because the J15 Ultra’s mop heads press down with a consistent 7 Newtons of force to dig at those stubborn areas. The J15 Ultra will even return to its base for an emptying and refilling and automatically return to areas of heavier spills or debris for another round of mopping.
The 19,000Pa of suction power makes the J15 Ultra a powerhouse for carpet cleaning, with a 99% debris removal rate that stands toe to toe with manual canister vacuums. The IntelliView AI technology built into the J15 Ultra combines an RGB vision sensor with LiDAR navigation, LED light and a line laser to give the robot the power to recognize over 150 obstacle types and intelligently adopt avoidance strategies on the fly. Enable the Spot Stain Cleaning feature in the Eureka App and that same IntelliView AI tech will also detect tougher stains and areas and give them a repeated, more intense level of cleaning.
Your time removing knots of hair and fur from your robot vacuum’s rollers are officially over, because the J15 Ultra’s FlexiRazor tech deploys sharp blades to proactively cut through hair wrap, reducing it by 99%. Add in 3D mapping and remote video supervision via the Eureka app, and support for Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri, and the Eureka J15 Ultra leaps to the head of the robotic floor cleaning class, especially at its Black Friday price of just $490.
See Eureka J15 Ultra at Amazon
Was: $180 Now: $144 (save 20%)
Eureka’s huge leaps forward in the world of robot floor cleaning have not come at the expense of their traditional manual standup vacuums. Those are more advanced, more effective, and more affordable than ever, as evidenced by the FlexReach Plus, a multi-surface deep cleaning superstar that’s a Black Friday steal at just $144 through Dec. 1.
The FlexReach Plus is Eureka’s most flexible model yet, designed to reach areas that neither you on your own or other vacuums are able to. The main pod of the FlexReach Plus detaches, and its lightweight construction makes it easy to reach for above-floor areas like stairs, furniture, and more. The extra-long 30-foot power cord just enhances the flexibility and cleaning reach of the FlexReach Plus, and when you get to those tough-to-reach areas, the 960W motor brings 192AW of suction power for a thorough removal of dirt and debris.
A full complement of useful accessories come with the FlexReach Plus, including a pet brush, crevice tool, and dusting brush that all easily attach to and detach from the extendable handle, which is connected by a nearly 10-foot hose. Built-in LED headlights illuminate floors and darker areas beneath furniture, so dust and hair stand out to be collected. Like its robotic brethren, the FlexReach Plus has a built-in anti-tangle brush roll. And whether you’re using the FlexReach Plus as a traditional floor vacuum or deploying its versatile extendable capabilities, the receptacle pod has a HEPA filter and complete-seal technology to keep all of the dust and dirt inside until it’s time to use the one-touch release for emptying.
Finding a floor vacuum this powerful and this versatile for this price is, well, a reach to say the least. The Black Friday price of just $144 for the Eureka FlexReach Plus is good through Dec. 1.

Was: $180 Now: $145 (save 19%)
Stick vacuums are known for being lightweight, portable, and easy to use. But smart? Not until now, at least, but the Eureka ReactiSense 451 certainly qualifies for that title. Also smart? Taking Eureka up on this 19%-off Black Friday offer on the ReactiSense 451, which brings its price down to just $145 through Dec. 1.
The ReactiSense 451 comes with groundbreaking Sense + React technology that detects different kinds of flooring, along with different kinds of dust and debris, and automatically adjusts its roller brush speed and considerable suction power to reduce manual control and clean more efficiently. That suction power can reach as high as 25,800Pa, so both large debris and fine dust are no match.
Everything you need to know about the ReactiSense 451 while in use, from the level of its rechargeable battery to the status of its filter and what mode it’s running in, is clearly displayed on a bright and easy to read LED screen at the top of the unit. Beneath that sits the receptacle, which also has Eureka’s Complete Seal technology and a HEPA filter to keep even fine particles like dander and pollen sealed in the unit. The anti-tangle brushroll, paired with a comb structure with fins designed to trap hair and fur, mean that even this lightweight unit is a champ at devouring hair and pet fur.
The Black Friday deal on the ReactiSense 451 is one of Eureka’s best deals of 2025, with the $145 price in effect through Dec. 1.

Was: $130 Now: $100 (save 23%)
Long story short, there isÂ way more vacuuming power in the Eureka ReactiClean 410 than there should be for a $130 stick vacuum, so you can imagine what that power-to-cost ratio looks like now that the Black Friday price of just $100 is in place through Dec. 1. You shouldn’t be able to use Sense & React technology or an anti-tangle brush or Complete Seal canister with HEPA filter for just $100, and you most definitely should not have up to 25,800Pa of suction power to lift even the most stubborn dirt and dust off of your floors for that price. And, yet, that’s the deal right now.
The Eureka ReactiClean 410 gives you that entire list of awesome features, along with one-touch emptying of its canister, swivel steering for those hard-to-reach floor spots and LED lighting to reveal those dust bunnies that have been able to hide from lesser vacuums, and a versatile 4-in-1 system that transforms the ReactiClean 410 into a powerful cleaning device for furniture, car upholstery, and elevated off-the-floor locations.
The detachable rechargeable battery pack means you can add a spare battery to your collection so you can have one always at the ready, although with a full hour of runtime on a single charge, enough to clean up to 1,614 square feet in one shot, you might not need one. Just add that to the list of features and perks that really should not be included with a $100 vacuum, but are thanks to the Black Friday deal on the Eureka ReactiClean 410 that runs through Dec. 1.

Science fiction is imaginary — until, suddenly, it isn't.
We are now on the brink of living in a world populated by humanoid robot assistants, a timeless trope of futuristic fiction. Right now, it's more the world of the ""Jetsons"" than that of ""Terminator,"" but that's not always readily apparent when you see the tall, sleek robots that companies are eagerly demoing.
The founders of some of America's most promising robotics startups say that we're not far away from a world in which humanoid robots are autonomously completing tasks in the home and on factory floors.
Business Insider compiled a list of some of the most well-known US companies in the space to highlight the current state of the humanoid robotics industry — and where it's headed.
While Tesla may be best known as an EV maker, the company has made its humanoid robot a key part of its future.
Optimus, Tesla's humanoid robot, is often trotted out at company events. It's been seen serving drinks, dancing, cleaning, and taking out the trash — at varying levels of autonomy (it's still very much in development and often tele-operated). The company says it is working to deploy its first fleet of Optimus robots in Tesla factories by the end of the year, but commercial production is further out.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk is motivated to bet big on Optimus. Among other benchmarks, he will need to deliver one million new Optimus robots over the next decade to fully earn his $1 trillion pay package, which Tesla shareholders approved in early November.
During the company's third-quarter earnings call, Musk said that the robot ""has the potential to be the biggest product of all time"" and projected that Tesla would eventually make 1 million robots every year. He has also said that Optimus would eventually account for around 80% of the company's value.
At the company shareholder event in November, Musk even suggested that Optimus could ""actually eliminate poverty.""
CEO and founder Brett Adcock says Figure is building its machines on the belief that ""the humanoid robot will be the ultimate deployment vector for AGI.""
AGI, or artificial general intelligence, is a still-theoretical and much-debated technology milestone generally viewed to be when AI can reason as well as humans. It's the thing all the leading AI companies are elbowing their way toward.
The company has $2.34 billion in funding, according to PitchBook.
The company's latest robot, Figure 03, is designed for household tasks like laundry, cleaning, and doing dishes.
The company says its overall mission is to ""develop general-purpose humanoids that make a positive impact on humanity and create a better life for future generations,"" especially ones that can ""eliminate the need for unsafe and undesirable jobs — ultimately allowing us to live happier, more purposeful lives.""
In the near-term, like ""single-digit years away,"" humanoid robots will be capable of doing useful work, Adcock said recently on the tech podcast ""Around the Prompt."" He told Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff at the annual Dreamforce conference in October that Figure was building ""a new species.""
1X, a dual Norwegian-American robot maker backed by OpenAI, is on a mission to develop ""general purpose robots that can coexist with humans and elevate humanity,"" according to its website.
To that end, it has two series of robots: Neo, designed for domestic tasks, and Eve, designed for industrial use in factories. The company recently began taking orders for Neo, which will cost $20,000 or a $499 a month subscription with an expected US launch in 2026. For now, the robots will require owners to be okay with them being tele-operated by a human outside the residence as Neo is trained.
""We are cloning human thought and behavior into a machine, alongside providing foundation models for robotic safety,"" Bernt Øivind Børnich, the CEO and founder, told Business Insider in 2024.
He said the company, which is more than eight years into developing androids, is seeing a clear market for its innovations.
""What is unique about us is that we have an android that can be safely deployed with humans, which opens up new consumer markets,"" Børnich said. ""These are complicated products looking for a market but we now have commercial traction which previously hadn't been proven out.""
The company has raised $140.36 million in funding as of July 2025, according to PitchBook. The Information reported in September 2025 that the company was seeking an additional $1 billion in funding.
Digit, Agility's 5-foot-9 humanoid robot, became the first of its kind to be ""paid"" for performing real work in 2024.
Under a multiyear deal with GXO Logistics, Agility deployed Digit at Spanx's women's wear factories, where it moves boxes and places them onto conveyor belts, and just hit 100,000 totes moved to date, a spokesperson for the company told Business Insider by email. The company has also deployed its robots with Schaeffler Group and Amazon, Agility's spokesperson added.
Peggy Johnson, an alum of Microsoft and Qualcomm, who became Digit's CEO last year, previously told Business Insider that it'd soon be ""very normal"" for humanoid robots to become coworkers with humans across a variety of workplaces.
Boston Dynamics, which was founded way back in 1992 and which is perhaps most famous for its ""robot dog,"" has built and deployed a suite of advanced robotics over the years.
Hyundai acquired the firm in 2021 for $1.1 billion. In April, Hyundai announced a $21 billion investment in the U.S., including $6 billion to promote investment and partnerships in the US.
Its viral dog-like robot, Spot, is used to inspect building sites or oil and gas facilities. An artist-in-residence at SpaceX has even trained some Spot robots to paint.
More recently, Boston Dynamics released a fully electric version of Atlas, its humanoid robot, which the company is now exploring for commercial use, starting with part sequencing, a common logistics task that involves arranging parts correctly in order for the cars that are being assembled, according to a company press release.
Boston Dynamics has long been a leader in robotics. Its founder, Marc Raibert, said in a 2024 podcast interview that ""it's hard not to think that seeing what Atlas is doing is a little bit of an inspiration"" for Tesla's Optimus.
Apptronik is an Austin-based humanoid robotics startup that spun out of the University of Texas' Human Centered Robotics Lab in 2016.
It unveiled its first humanoid, Apollo, in August 2023.
It had $772.78 million in funding as of November 2025, according to PitchBook.
""The big idea is a humanoid robot should be able to fit in all the places that a human can fit into and use all the same tools that humans can use,"" Apptronik CEO Jeff Cardenas told Business Insider at the time. ""That allows them to integrate into a world that's built for us versus having to modify the world for the robots.""
The company is targeting a new funding round of $500 million, which would value it at $5 billion, according to the Austin Business Journal.

Shares in Puma have soared today after reports that Chinese sports apparel firm Anta Sports Products is among Asian firms exploring a potential takeover of the German sports company.
Hong Kong-listed Anta has been working with an adviser to evaluate a bid for Puma, according to Bloomberg and could potentially team up with a private equity firm.
Puma shares surged nearly 15% in early Frankfurt trading, although they are still down by over half their value in the year to date. Other potential bidders could include rival Chinese apparel firm Li Ning Co., named after the legendary gymnast who founded the company, and Japan’s Asics Corp.
Anta owns brands including Fila and Jack Wolfskin and its shares have gained around 10% in Hong Kong trading this year, giving the company a market value of $31 billion. Previously, an Anta-led consortium, which also included Asian buyout firm FountainVest Partners, paid $5.2 billion in 2019 to acquire Amer Sports, the owner of brands including Salomon and Arc’teryx.
Amer then held an initial public offering in New York last year, with Anta retaing a stake as its biggest investor.
The valuation expectations of Puma’s biggest shareholder, France’s wealthy Pinault family which owns 29% of the business through its Artémis holding company, could come into play for any transaction, with the company’s market value prior to the bid rumors wallowing at around $2.9 billion.
However, inthe fall François-Henri Pinault, managing partner at Artémis, described the family’s Puma stake as interesting but not strategic, and said that it was keeping its options open.
Anta’s multi-brand strategy has given it exposure to premium performance and lifestyle categories as well as volume mass markets. Puma’s 2024 revenue was roughly $10.2 billion, putting the two companies in the same revenue ballpark but with very different profitability and valuation profiles.
Crucially, Puma’s market capitalization has been depressed through 2025 and the valuation gap between its current position and its global reach and brand recognition is no doubt the immediate driver of interest for large, cash-rich buyers such as Anta.
Any move would also enablie it to expand its footprint in the increasingly competitive North American and EMEA regions quickly.
The Anta playbook — buy scale, preserve brand autonomy for premium labels, and extract distribution and supply-chain synergies — has precedent in its handling of Fila China and Amer Sports. With Anta’s market capitalization near $30 billion and reported cash and strong free-cash-flow generation, financing a transaction is well within its capabilities.
However, Anta’s own 2025 interim disclosures showed that despite the company holding sizable cash balances and generating strong operating cash inflows, the group has also navigated a tougher global consumer backdrop even as it consolidates market share domestically. 
Founded in 1948, Puma has been trying to revamp itself under new Chief Executive Officer Arthur Hoeld after failing to generate much enthusiasm for its product ranges with consumers in recent years. Its current sponsorships include English Premier League soccer team Manchester City, the Portugal national soccer team and Denmark’s men’s handball team.
In a bid to reduce costs, Puma confirmed last month it plans to slash 900 more jobs and sharpen its focus on running, soccer and training, with a stated goal to return to growth by 2027 and to re-establish itself as a top three sports brand globally."

As game sizes continue to grow with new releases sometimes topping 100GB, itâs becoming harder to make room to play them all. You have two options: either delete games after you finish them or expand your storage. The simpler and more permanent solution? Upgrading to a larger solid-state drive. Currently, the Samsung 9100 Pro SSD is on sale at Amazon, offering discounts up to 33%.Â This SSD is available in several storage sizes, including 1TB, 2TB, 4TB, and an enormous 8TB option. With the sale, you can save anywhere from $60 to $250 depending on the version you choose. The 1TB model is now $135 (down from $200), the 2TB version is $220 (down from $280), the 4TB model is priced at $370 (down from $470), and the 8TB version is available for $750 (down from $1,000).
Instead of constantly juggling downloads, you can switch between games whenever you feel like jumping back into an old favorite. This convenience extends to other large applications as well, whether youâre editing 4K footage from large files or storing extensive media collections.

Beyond just giving you all that extra storage space, the Samsung 9100 Pro will deliver solid performance. With read speeds reaching 14,700 MB/s and write speeds of up to 13,300 MB/s, this SSD offers blazing-fast data transfers while remaining power-efficient. Whether youâre gaming, editing videos, working with large datasets, or whatever else it is you do at your computer, the Samsung 9100 Pro provides the performance you need without putting unnecessary strain on your systemâs power usage.
If youâre a PlayStation 5 owner, youâve probably noticed that storage can be tight. The PS5 comes with only 825GB of internal storage, and with the growing size of AAA games, youâll find yourself deleting and reinstalling games just to make room for new ones. Fortunately, the PS5 allows you to expand its storage with a compatible M.2 SSD, and the Samsung 9100 Pro is one such option. However, if you want to avoid overheating, itâs crucial to get the version with a heatsink. These are small metal casings that sit around the SSD which allow heat to dissipate.





Installing the SSD in your PS5 is a straightforward process that you can follow along with watching any number of YouTube tutorials. Right now, the 2TB version with a heatsink is priced at $209, the 4TB version is $399, and the big 8TB version is $800. The 1TB with heatsink option is currently out of stock.
Heatsinks on their own go for about $10 to $20. Now when you compare each of the Samsung 9100 Pro SSDs here, with and without heatsink, there’s definitely a drop off in value. The 2TB option with a heatsink is actually cheaper than without so there’s not reason not to pick up that one (where you end up using the heatsink or not). The 4TB model is about $20 more with a heatsink. That isn’t bad but you might be able to pick up the standard version and find a different heatsink for less. Then the 8TB price difference is laughable. It’s $50 more to get it with the heatsink. Don’t do that. Get yourself another one for far less.

49,2025-11-27,"A new report from Counterpoint Research shows that the iPhone’s comeback in China is still going strong. Here are the details.
For the past few months, multiple reports from China have shown that Apple has managed to put a years-long sales slump behind it and has seen strong iPhone demand.
And while the numbers began to look up even before the launch of the iPhone 17 line, Apple has steadily outgrown and outpaced the smartphone market since the new devices came out.
In that vein, a new report from Counterpoint Research (via Reuters) shows that the iPhone was the clear winner of China’s month-long Singles Day sales festival, which wrapped on November 11.
The report says the iPhone 17 accounted for 26% of all smartphones sold during the festival, which is particularly notable given that overall smartphone sales rose just by 3% year-over-year.
According to Counterpoint, without the iPhone 17 lineup, the market would have posted a 5% decline instead of this modest gain.
From Reuters’ report, based on numbers from data provider Syntun:
“In the smartphone segment, Huawei saw the biggest decline among major brands with its share falling to 13% of sales, down from 17% last year. Its flagship Mate 80, launched earlier this week, missed the sales period.
Xiaomi phones accounted for the second-largest share of sales with 17%, though its sales declined from a year earlier due to the earlier timing of its Xiaomi 17 series launch.”
While limited to China, these numbers track with the expectations Apple set in its most recent quarterly report, when the company said it was heading into what should be its best holiday quarter ever.
And with much of the season still ahead, Apple looks to be well on track to meet that guidance.
Do you think Apple will keep this momentum during the holiday season? Let us know in the comments.

Black Friday officially kicks off tomorrow, but you don’t have to wait till then to start shopping and bagging discounts. There’s a ton going for less right now; we’re talking plenty of tech gadgets, kitchen appliances, smart home devices, plus entertainment options. Amazon is being the most generous of all retailers, as it’s offering up to 50% off its own devices!
Those looking to give their entertainment setup an upgrade should consider grabbing the latest Amazon Fire TV Stick HD, which is slashed by 49% right now. It typically retails for $35, but the current discount drops the price to just $18. The offer is open to all shoppers (Prime and non-Prime members), but the discount and the stock won’t be around for long. Lock the drop in before the Black Friday rush hits.
See at Amazon
The stick is tiny, but don’t let that fool you. It’s made for HD TVs, and lets you stream all your favorite content, whether it’s TV shows from the 90s or the latest crime thrillers in lifelike, detailed visuals that make every color pop in both dim and bright settings. Entertainment comes built right in. There’s support for all the popular streaming platforms (Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, Peacock, and more), so you’ll never be out of content to watch. Binge the season 5 of Stranger Things on Netflix, and end the night with an episode of The Paper on Peacock to cool things down; all from a single place.
These platforms require subscriptions, though. Trying to cut back on those? No sweat. The stick also lets you access over 1 million free movies and TV episodes from ad-supported streaming apps like Prime Video, Tubi, Pluto TV, and more. Those who prefer live TV for a more cable-like feel can consider subscribing to platforms like Sling TV and YouTube TV. This way, you’ll also be able to keep an eye on what’s happening around the world, check the weather, and even watch live sports. Maybe get the day started with some worldly updates, and end it with an episode of your favorite series; the possibilities are endless. Support for music platforms like Amazon Music, Spotify, and Pandora makes it just as easy to listen to your favorite songs throughout the day without pulling your phone out, making it a true all-in-one entertainment device.
The stick comes with a remote for easy navigation, but for times you’re not in the mood to control it manually, you can just use your voice to command, and Alexa will answer. Ask it to launch shows, lower the volume, skip through a scene, and pause; without getting up from your couch. Fire TV Search also lets you find movies by actor, plot, and quotes, so you can also say something like “Alexa, show me the best horror shows of all time” or “Alexa, show me the latest Ryan Gosling movies” instead of getting lost scrolling through a huge library on your own.
To get started, all that you need to do is plug the Fire TV Stick HD directly into your HDTV or use the included HDMI extender. Plug it into a wall outlet, and connect to the internet. Follow the on-screen instructions to finish the setup. The latest Fire TV Stick HD was already quite affordable at $35, but you can now grab it for just $18 with Amazon’s Black Friday sale. It’s the lowest we have seen it drop to in a long while, and at under $20, it’s practically a steal considering all the features you’re getting.

Organized workstations don’t just look better, they make you more productive too. If you use a bunch of devices to get your busy work and play days (multiple monitors, laptop, keyboard, mouse, external storage), you need something that ties the entire setup together with a single unit. A docking station does that job well, and if you’ve been on the lookout for one, we just spotted a great deal to pick a highly-rated option for less.
Thanks to Black Friday, Amazon is offering the 14-in-1 160W Anker Prime docking station for $161. That’s after a nice 40% discount on the retail price of $270. It’s the lowest we have seen it drop to in 90 days, which means it didn’t even go this low during the October Prime Day. It’s selling out fast, though, so it’s best to snap it up as soon as you can.
See at Amazon
The dock gets you 14 ports in total. The front panel offers you two USB-C (10Gbps), two USB-C (100W Max), one USB-A (10Gbps), one USB-A (12W Max), and one 3.5mm audio jack. On the back, there’s an Ethernet (1Gbps), three USB-A (480Mbps), one HDMI 2.0 (4K@60Hz), one USB-C upstream port, and an LED indicator. The three USB-C ports at 100W max each and one USB-A port at 12W max are capable of juicing your essentials up with 160W of total output. It’s great to power your laptop as you work without looking for another outlet, and even quickly top your smartphone or headphones up. Four charging ports mean you can charge multiple devices at the same time. The station even makes custom power allocation possible with its dedicated app, so you can always prioritize important devices. Need to head out for a meeting in a few minutes? Prioritize your laptop while still keeping your AirPods topped up.
Support for bigger workstations comes from the dual HDMI ports that let you stream or mirror across two additional displays at the same time, but only on Windows. You’ll get up to 2K@60Hz on a DP 1.4 laptop or 1080p@60Hz with a DP 1.2 machine. Those using macOS will only be able to mirror their main display. It’s not ideal, but can come in handy when you need to share your screen with others. Otherwise, compatibility is impressive. The station works nicely with Windows 10 and 11, ChromeOS, and laptops that support DP Alt Mode and Power Delivery. It’s not made for Linux, though.
You will always be kept in the loop with the smart display, which shows total wattage and interface status, plus gives visuals and overheat alerts when needed. And finally, despite all the power, the docking station remains portable and lightweight; enough to carry around easily with you on the go. Just toss it in your laptop bag, and you’ll be able to create an efficient workstation anywhere you want. Overheating won’t be a concern either, thanks to the built-in airflow system, paired with ActiveSheild temperature monitoring. The latter monitors the temperature of the docking station 3,000,000 times per day, and instantly notifies you if something feels off.
All in all, if you’ve been wanting to make your workstation cleaner, Anker Prime does a great job at that. You’ll still be able to use all your devices, just in a more efficient, smartly-managed way. It’s now down to $161, so you’re saving a nice $109 on it right now. Grab the deal fast before it expires for good, or the stock runs out.

EXCLUSIVE: British indie Shogun Films and local distributor Trinity Content Partners are the latest to enter the microdrama arena with the pair teaming up on crime story Swipe!

Lock Stock and Harry Potter actor Nick Moran is set to play the villain in the project, which heralds from writer-director Paul Knight (24 Hours In London) and producer Jonathan Sothcott (Strippers vs Werewolves).

	The synopsis reads: “When a petty corner-shop robbery lands three young men in possession of a mysterious, high-stakes package, they become targets of a ruthless criminal network and the streets of south London become a deadly chessboard.” The aim is to film next spring.

	Shogun, whose credits include low-budget Brit crime films such as Renegades and Nemesis, says it plans to shoot a traditional feature version of the story simultaneously. Trinity Content Partners will handle worldwide sales and distribution.

	“If the Brit crime genre as we know it started with Lock Stock, it only feels right to embark on something so ground-breaking in this space with Nick as a key part of it,” said producer Sothcott. 

	Moran has starred in Shogun films including Nemesis, Renegades and the upcoming Knightfall and a new feature project entitled Lionheart also pencilled for next year. 

	Sothcott added: “The vertical microdrama market is the hottest format in the business right now and as experts in telling high quality genre stories at sensible prices, Shogun Films is incredibly well placed to march into this space and stick a flag in the genre we know so well. The frenetic energy of a punchy British crime film with its natural dramatic highs and lows and big characters suits this format incredibly well and by producing a feature version concurrently we have the perfect platform to introduce British audiences to this exciting new format.”

	He continued: “While traditional movies continue to be the heart and soul of our business, we are following our philosophy of doing not talking and jumping straight into this exciting new market. This is a modern, edgy project with a great script and a talented filmmaker. The world we’ll create lends itself to all manner of prequels, sequels and spin offs and we can see these Verticals becoming a robust strand of our business in the long term.”

	










	Andy Taylor, Commercial Director for Trinity Content Partners, explained: “Vertical storytelling is transforming how audiences discover new voices and new worlds, and Swipe! represents exactly the kind of bold, high-energy British genre filmmaking we want to champion. Shogun Films are ahead of the curve in this space, and we’re thrilled to partner with them on a project that pushes both creative and commercial boundaries. With its dual-format approach and a killer team behind it, Swipe! is set to be a standout moment in the rise of vertical drama.”

	Shogun says it is also developing a modern vampire story and a police thriller in the vertical microdrama genre.

Swipe! is part of a distribution relationship between Shogun and Trinity that includes Martin Kemp serial killer thriller Doctor Plague, released in January, upcoming horror Harbinger, and The Secret of Guy Fawkes, which is currently in production.

It's currently on sale for £499 with a special coupon code that slashes an extra £100 off its £599 price tag, but only while stocks last!

And for £499 with coupon code COPILOT100, it would be crazy not to pick one up right now.
I was one of the first to review the Surface Laptop 13-inch in the UK earlier this year, and I found the device to be an excellent all rounder with good performance and great battery life. At the time, I said the Surface Laptop 13-inch was a bit expensive, and that those waiting to buy one should wait for a sales event.
Well, that time has finally come. The Surface Laptop 13-inch is usually £899, but Curry's Black Friday deal slashes £300 off to 599, and with the coupon code COPILOT100 you can get an extra 100 off bringing it down to just £499.

It's a real champ in the battery life department, being Microsoft's longest lasting Surface PC to date and lasting the entire day easily thanks to that efficient Snapdragon chip.
Yes, the Surface Laptop 13-inch features make it a Copilot+ PC thanks to an NPU that outputs 45 TOPS of power, which means it's fully capable of Copilot+ capabilities.

Filipino coffee chain Pickup Coffee is preparing for a fast‑paced expansion across the Philippines up to 2027/28.
“We want to open at least 20 stores per month for the next 24 to 36 months,” Pickup Coffee president and CEO Francis Flores told BusinessWorld.

As of August 2025, the company operated 420 locations nationwide and believes there is still significant room to grow, particularly in Northern Luzon, the Visayas and Mindanao.
Flores noted that most existing outlets are concentrated in central business districts, leaving potential sites in shopping centres, hospitals, airports and high‑traffic transport hubs largely untapped.
Founded in 2022, Pickup Coffee describes itself as a tech‑driven coffee startup that offers “premium‑style drinks at lower price points”.
Its signature green kiosks and carts serve espresso beverages, milk‑based drinks, matcha, teas, cold brew, blended frappés, yoghurt drinks and pastries.
Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis.
The brand’s core customer base consists largely of business process outsourcing employees seeking relatively low‑cost coffee during late‑night and early‑morning shifts.
Alongside its kiosk model, the company is also building out a larger café concept under the Pickup Prime banner.
Two Pickup Prime outlets are currently operating: one at Ayala Malls Vertis North in Quezon City and another at SM Seaside City Cebu.
A third full‑format café is planned for Bonifacio Global City by mid‑2026.
Beyond the domestic market, Pickup Coffee runs 50 outlets in Mexico as part of its efforts to establish a presence overseas.
The company expects demand to remain strong, pointing to the Philippines’ status as one of Southeast Asia’s bigger coffee‑drinking markets.
“Young people are always on the move and have more active lifestyles. We see out-of-home coffee consumption continuing to grow,” Flores said.
He also observed that interest in entrepreneurship is rising, particularly among younger Filipinos.
“In previous generations, the goal was to climb the corporate ladder,” he continued. “Many Gen Zs now want to build their own businesses. When you talk to graduating students, a lot of them prefer to work for a startup.”

Kevin Hannegan is proud of the string of part-time gigs he has taken on while looking for full-time work. He's just not sure they belong on his résumé.
Since being laid off from his director role at a publishing company in January 2024, Hannegan has driven for DoorDash, worked on the changeover crew at the Lenovo Center in Raleigh — helping convert the arena between concerts and sporting events — and taken on odd jobs for friends, including fixing deck boards and replacing ceiling fans.
He said he asked several people in his life whether it's wise to include gigs like these on his résumé when applying for full-time roles in his field, and the feedback was roughly split. Half said he should, since it showed he was still working; the other half said listing roles that weren't full-time or relevant to his field probably wouldn't be helpful.
Regardless of what he includes, he knows employers will likely have questions about the past two years.
""Being unemployed from full-time work for this long will definitely require some explanation during an interview — whether the information is on a résumé or not,"" said Hannegan, who's in his 50s.
Hannegan is one of several job seekers Business Insider has spoken with over the past year who have taken part-time jobs outside their field to earn income while continuing to search for work. Many said they've grappled with whether to include temporary roles on their applications — fearing that a résumé gap could hurt their chances, but that listing a job significantly different from their desired role might do the same.
In a challenging job market, some candidates say even small résumé choices are worth agonizing over.

A San Francisco-based millennial has worked contract positions at Microsoft and Amazon in recent years, earning about $120,000 annually. When the latter ended in December 2023, he struggled to find another role.
At first, he wasn't interested in the job postings recruiters sent him that offered as little as $75,000 a year. But after a year of struggling to find work — and relying on unemployment benefits and food stamps to stay afloat — his perspective shifted.
""By the end of 2024, I would have loved to make $75,000,"" he said.
After a year of unemployment, he began applying for any gig he could find, and eventually secured work as a ghost tour guide for $30 an hour and a US Postal Service mail carrier for $24 hourly. He estimated that he'll earn about $55,000 this year across the two jobs.
While he hasn't stopped applying for communications roles, you won't find either of his current gigs on his résumé. He believes many companies are biased against candidates who are unemployed or working outside their field.
It's unclear how much job seekers stand to gain by leaving certain gigs off their applications. Priya Rathod, workplace trends editor at Indeed, said it's generally wise to include any work experience — even if it's temporary or outside one's field — and to highlight the skills gained from those roles.
""It's not a surprise to employers right now that a lot of people are struggling in the job market,"" she said, ""And I think it shows initiative that you've continued to stay in the workforce in some capacity.""
Hannegan said he considered adding his changeover crew job to his résumé because it's a unique role that might catch an employer's attention — and signals that he's willing to do whatever it takes to support his family.
However, Hannegan isn't optimistic that tweaking his résumé would make a difference. He said he recently decided to pause his search for a full-time role and focus on part-time gigs.
""It's exhausting to put in the work and get no response,"" he said.
Some job seekers aren't just being selective about which gigs they include in applications — they're also trying to avoid a résumé gap. The key, some say, is finding any relevant experience they can frame as their current role.
In addition to leaving his mailman and ghost tour gigs off his résumé, the San Francisco-based millennial lists his current employment as an independent communications consulting business. He said the business is barely active and brings in little income, but he includes it to avoid showing an employment gap — and to maintain the appearance that he's still working in his field.
""I have to keep this charade up that my independent communications business is healthy and successful and that I'm not hustling as a letter carrier,"" he said.
Miles Bradley has been searching for work since losing his contract software engineering role at AT&T in 2022. He said he's the chief technology officer of a startup, but the company is still securing funding and isn't yet providing any income. Still, he keeps it on his résumé to signal that he remains active in the tech industry.
""The industry has become addicted to finding the 'Goldilocks' candidates,"" said Bradley, who's in his 50s and lives in New York. ""They want to have somebody that exactly fits what they're looking for.""
Lisa Rangel, CEO of Chameleon Resumes, an executive job search firm, said job seekers have good reason to keep a current position on their résumés — and especially on their LinkedIn profiles. Some recruiters, she said, are more likely to search for candidates who are currently employed — in part because they're perceived as a ""safer"" hire than someone who isn't working.
To improve their chances of being discovered, Rangel recommends job seekers add a current position to their LinkedIn profile if they're not formally employed. This could be a personal consulting or freelance role — if they've done relevant work — or a placeholder title such as ""Seeking marketing manager role,"" with the ""company"" field reflecting their target industry.
""You need a 'current position' that outlines what you are doing during your unemployment period,"" Rangel said.
At a minimum, Indeed's Rathod recommends that job seekers address résumé gaps in their résumé and cover letters, as well as during interviews.
Juan Pelaez said he's been fortunate not to have an employment gap on his résumé, despite being laid off in 2023. That's because he's continued doing part-time work for his former employer while searching for full-time marketing and project management roles.
Pelaez, who's in his 40s, also has a side gig that he has debated including in his applications. To earn some income during his job search, he's worked as a background actor on a few films — including ""Happy Gilmore 2."" He hasn't listed the acting work on his résumé, but said he's now reconsidering.
""Not having it on there hasn't yielded positive results, so maybe putting it in there would help,"" he said.

When bank CEOs start talking about AI, the financial world lights up — from meme accounts to markets. Their predictions about how generative AI will change work can move stocks, reshape strategy, and set the tone for the rest of corporate America.
Banks' plans, and increasingly, actions, around generative AI give a glimpse into how the technology will enhance and replace human workers.
But you know who else is listening? Their employees. Many of the largest bulge-bracket banks employ over 100,000 employees each, and the FDIC-insured commercial banking sector, more broadly, employs nearly 2 million people.
These can range from bank tellers to dealmakers making multi-billion-dollar salaries, as well as a veritable army of software engineers who will turn this generative AI dream into a reality.
In order to get a better understanding of what they're thinking, we've highlighted some of the most revealing statements about bank head count in the age of AI below.
Jamie Dimon's penchant for straight talk means that Dimon is willing to admit that job cuts are coming.
""It will eliminate jobs,"" Dimon said at a Fortune-hosted conference earlier this month. ""People should stop sticking their heads in the sand.""
The comments echoed those Dimon made at a town hall for the firm's employees in Columbus, Ohio, earlier this year, where he said that AI will ""change some of your jobs,"" whether as a ""copilot,"" a solution for ""drudgery,"" or by eliminating them.
More immediately for JPMorgan, according to an interview on CNN earlier this month, Dimon sees head count remaining steady, or even rising, as AI continues to roll out, ""if we do a good job.""
Core to JPMorgan's promise is increased efficiency, which Dimon explored during the 2024 Alliance Bernstein conference.
""It will affect every job, every application, every database, and it will make people highly more efficient,"" Dimon said. ""Like a lot of you clicking away, taking notes. You won't have to do that because it will — you can just summarize what Jamie said. You push a button, and you don't have to waste all that time.""
He also explained how increased efficiency could also create more jobs in cybersecurity.
""We use it for risk and fraud recognition, and bad guys are going to use it,"" Dimon said. ""So, we have to use it to counter the bad guys. We have to use it to get better and better in cyber.""
Other executives at the firm are even more explicit about how headcount at the firm is changing now.
In operations, the ""tip of the spear"" on using this new technology, executives expect head count to trend down 10% through 2029, according to Marianne Lake, the CEO of consumer and community banking.
Jeremy Barnum, the firm's CFO, said they're ""asking people to resist head count growth where possible and increase their focus on efficiency.""
While a more efficient future with an equal number of working and non-working weekdays may exist in the coming decades, according to Dimon, for now, hiring may slow.
David Solomon's most definitive statement about how AI will affect Goldman actually came from a memo he released earlier this year alongside the firm's president John Waldron and CFO Denis Coleman.
The memo, announcing the third iteration of the bank's cross-bank initiative OneGS, explains that AI will drive efficiency at the firm. Driving efficiency will mean slowing hiring and reducing roles at the firm, which is no stranger to job cuts, with a yearly culling of some employees.
""We're asking people to resist head count growth where possible and increase their focus on efficiency,"" the memo said. This will be part of a broader initiative to find the ""right team structure"" and to gain ""more agility.""
When Business Insider obtained the memo and reported on it, a spokesperson for the bank told us that the firm anticipates an increased head count at the end of 2025, and in the third quarter of 2025, it announced it had grown its global workforce 5% to about 48,000 positions.
Slowing hiring and increasing head count don't need to be contradictory; instead, the firm is focusing its hiring on the right talent.
""We need more high-value people,"" Solomon told Axios in October. ""We can afford more high-value people to expand our footprint and continue to grow and broaden our business.""
Solomon continues to believe that AI will grow the firm's head count over the next 10 years.
""There are obviously things where we're going to have a lot fewer people — but I'd love to have the capacity to go get more people to spend time with clients,"" Solomon said at a conference last month, noting that AI will have its most immediate impact on software development.
Speaking more generally earlier this month, he said that ""disruption"" will happen, but ""our economy is very nimble, very flexible.""
""And when you look at the technology that has flooded over hundreds of years into our society, we adapt,"" Solomon said. ""We find new businesses. We find new jobs. I don't believe it will be different this time.""
The adoption may come quicker than previous changes, like the creation of the internet or the rollout of electricity. And Solomon shares the views of others that professional workers may take the hardest hit.
""The need for some white-collar office jobs will be diminished, but they'll be picked up in other parts of the economy,"" said Solomon.
Back in 2023, Jane Fraser wrote a LinkedIn post walking through her big picture thoughts about AI at the bank. She, like her peers at the bulge brackets, saw big-time transformation ahead.
""In the near term, generative AI will drastically improve productivity,"" she wrote. ""Over the long term, it has the potential to revolutionize all functions across our bank and the industry — changing how we write code, onboard clients, service customers, detect fraud, develop market research and strengthen compliance and controls.""
On a recent earnings call, Fraser explained how it was already increasing productivity.
""AI-driven automated code reviews have exceeded 1 million so far this year and are dramatically improving our developers' productivity,"" Fraser said. ""This innovation alone saves considerable time and creates around 100,000 hours of weekly capacity.""
Fraser also highlighted how AI is helping their customer service teams resolve client inquiries faster, their wealth advisors provide more personalized advice, and the firm is launching an agent-based AI pilot to tackle more complex tasks.
When she was asked by CNBC this month if productivity increases from AI will lead to layoffs, Fraser said her ""fear"" is that AI might ""pinch"" the job market ""before it pays."" But, with adoption only at 10% globally, she said, it's a long way before adoption is widespread enough to see what it will do for layoffs. Fraser said adoption will need to be closer to 50%. ""It's not there yet, and we don't know how quickly,"" Fraser said.
Wells Fargo has already shrunk its headcount by nearly a quarter since Charles Scharf joined in 2019, and he expects that trend to continue.
""It's likely we'll have less headcount as we look forward ... we'd like to do much of it through attrition as possible,"" Scharf told Reuters this month.
He said the lower headcount is an ""outcome"" of the firm's focus on areas where it's ""way too inefficient"" and ""way too bureaucratic."" From 2018 to June of this year, the firm had a $1.95 trillion asset cap, hindering its ability to grow.
In the same interview, Scharf called out those who are saying that AI won't reduce jobs.
""The opportunities that exist in AI are very significant, and anyone who sits here today and says that they don't think they'll have less head count because of AI either doesn't know what they're talking about or is just not being totally honest about it,"" he said.
Bank of America has set a new industry standard, with a minimum wage of $25 an hour across the company. And while CEO Brian Moynihan conceded on a September Bloomberg TV interview that generative AI adoption has shrunk the size of some departments, the bank is focusing on training employees to do what LLMs cannot.
""The key to that is really redeploying people and re-skilling them,"" he said. ""We have to be more mindful about training them along multiple dimensions than we might have been two or three years ago.""

63,2025-11-27,"Taking a GLP-1 medication? A guide for what to avoid during the holiday season — and how to still enjoy dessert
Getty
 Thanksgiving Day doesn't have to be limiting for those taking GLP-1 medications such as Ozempic for diabetes or weight loss — but experts say some holiday favorites should be avoided.

 On the no list? ""I would definitely say mac and cheese,"" dietitian Kylie Bensley, founder of the women's nutrition company Sulinu, tells PEOPLE.

 She adds, ""It's one of those dishes that you really can't make low-fat, you really can't make it light. Sometimes, it's even hard to digest just because it's just carbs and fat and could make you feel worse.""

Getty
 Bensley also cautions people to keep their blood sugar in mind: While Ozempic has become a trendy weight-loss aid, it's approved by the FDA for those living with type 2 diabetes.

 For this reason, Bensley suggests avoiding ""candied yams, for sure.""

 ""Your blood sugar is so dramatically affected,"" she explains, noting that candied yams are ""mostly all sugar, and very little nutrient value.""

 Per Bensley, sugar can also be a problem in some cocktails, advising people to skip ""any heavy, heavy alcohol drinks"" or ""any cream-based drinks.""

Getty
 Those who want to imbibe should choose spritzers, such as a wine spritzer with cranberries.

 ""It's fun and festive and you enjoy it, but also it's not going to drastically affect your blood sugar,"" she explains.

 Consuming dairy should not be a huge worry, and there's no need to go completely dairy-free, according to Bensley. She suggests pairing cheese with fruit, for example, to add more fiber to aid digestion.

 An overall good strategy is ""protein first, veggies second.""

 Even if you decide to indulge in macaroni and cheese, Bensley said to ""make sure that it's no more than 25% of your plate — and eat your protein first.""

 You can have dessert, Bensley says, with one caveat: Consider eating it with the meal to avoid a blood sugar spike.

Getty
 ""I love Thanksgiving for the pumpkin pie — it's such a low-sugar dessert that it tends to be fine for your blood sugar,"" she notes. ""Chocolate is okay, but just try to do it with your meal to keep that blood sugar stable.""

 If you overeat on Thanksgiving, Bensley advises sipping peppermint or fennel tea and going for a walk to get your digestive system moving.

 ""Quickly forgive yourself and you move on,"" she says. ""Don't spiral in through all the holidays. Don't throw up your hands and say, 'I've given up, I'm just gonna go into a general spiral through New Year's.' ""

 Bensley added, ""We just practice fast forgiveness, we move on. And we practice more mindfulness at the next meal.""

In this morning's First Trade newsletter, we highlighted five things investors have had to be thankful for in 2025. Sticking with the Thanksgiving and Black Friday theme, we thought we'd highlight a few food and toy-related stocks for you to chew on.
On Monday, I spoke with Megan Clapp, a food and leisure analyst at Morgan Stanley, who shared a few of her ""Overweight""-rated stocks at the moment.
The first is Bellring Brands (BRBR), which produces protein shakes. The stock has been severely beaten down this year, falling 59% since early January, as investors worry about intense competition.
But Clapp said the stock is probably now too undervalued and is ""getting interesting again,"" as protein shake sales growth is in the mid-teens year-over-year, and as the company starts to make competitive moves.
""They announced a large mass retailer partnership with the largest mass retailer that will start rolling out in December. They are getting a ton of new display in the store,"" Clapp said.
Second is Smithfield Foods (SFD), a pork producer whose stock is up 8% this year. Clapp said that hog prices are coming down, which should boost the company's margins. Plus — like Bellring — people can't seem to get enough protein these days.
""Pork has been resilient, continues to benefit from this whole protein craze,"" Clapp said, adding that it also ""benefits from the fact that beef is very expensive — beef supply is expected to remain pretty tight into next year.""
Finally, to send you into Black Friday, is game and toymaker Hasbro (HAS), which is up 46% in 2025.
""It's a nice play on the holiday season because they have a toy business, but bigger picture they've been executing a successful transformation and a strategic transformation into a gaming and IP-driven company,"" Clapp said. ""We think investors still underappreciate the durability of its growth algorithm and the margin and free cash flow benefits from this portfolio shift.""
Some of its top intellectual property includes Transformers, Dungeons & Dragons, Operation, Monopoly, Nerf, and Magic: The Gathering. The latter, a trading card game, has seen a 40% increase in revenue so far this year. It also has a TV show and movie in production, Hasbro announced earlier this year.

74,2025-11-27,"This story is based on a conversation with marketing specialist Jennifer Cody Kemp, 53, a mother of one, who lives in Alicante, Spain. It has been edited for length and clarity.
My mind was racing wildly as I waited at the Cairo airport for my flight back to the US in October 2024.
I'd spent nearly two weeks on a girls' trip to Egypt: the thought of returning to everyday life and my corporate job in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, filled me with dread.
A voice in my head said, ""You don't have to stay on the hamster wheel and deserve to be happy."" My thoughts went back and forth. My cost of living was getting ridiculous in the US, and the more money I made, the more money I needed.
I'd traveled all over the world and particularly enjoyed visiting Europe, where things were cheaper, more fun, and less demanding. What if I made a permanent move to one of my favorite countries, Spain?
First, I booked an appointment with my financial advisor to review the numbers. He said I'd set myself up well for the change, and there was absolutely no reason for me to put it off.
Do you have a story about life as an expat? Please send details to jridley@insider.com
He understood when I said I didn't want to work another 15 years and miss out on the things I wanted to do right now. My father died at just 67 in 2020. I'd already lost a couple of friends who were my age, too.
Next, I sought advice from the online agency Move Overseas Now to secure a digital nomad visa in Spain.
I quit my job, which I'd held for 28 years, in April of this year, put my 2,600-square-foot, four-bedroom house on the market, and flew to Europe the following month. My son, Mark, 24, joined me for a long vacation.
I decided to settle in the city of Alicante, on the Costa Blanca, in southern Spain, because of its great climate and the nearby beaches and mountains.
My first step was to rent a 1,300-square-foot, two-bedroom apartment in the city center. It costs the equivalent of $925 a month, compared to my mortgage in Florida, which was $1,600.
I was glad to no longer pay my annual $7,300 housing tax, nor my $450-a-month health insurance, co-pays, and referral fees. Spain has a universal healthcare system.
Giving up my car saved me $450 a month in motor vehicle insurance. People walk everywhere in Alicante. And it's a 12-minute bus ride from my home to the beach.
You can enjoy a glass of wine here for the equivalent of $3.50, and groceries are significantly less expensive. For example, I recently bought two dozen eggs for $2.50, compared to the $12 I spent in the US.
My income — generated from my work with individual clients, including a publishing company — goes a lot further. I can eat out when I like, which is a great opportunity to meet new people.
I'm single and use dating apps, but I much prefer to start a conversation with someone in a restaurant or bar instead. It comes more easily in Spain.
Still, it hasn't all been plain sailing. The biggest challenge was adjusting to the so-called ""tranquilo"" lifestyle, which is designed to promote relaxation and calmness.
The culture I experienced in the US was immediate gratification. If I wanted something, I could order it on Amazon. The item could be there the same day, or at least two days later. Here, you've got to learn patience and wait.
Many stores in Florida are open 24 hours a day. The Spanish siesta usually lasts two or three hours. There'll be a sign on the door saying, ""We'll be back at 5 p.m.""
Most supermarkets are closed on Wednesdays, so it's best to do your shopping by Tuesday night.
It can also be frustrating to find the products that you want. But it pays to have a sense of humor about it. I don't drink regular coffee — I only drink mushroom coffee — and had used up the 90-day supply I'd bought from home.
I visited various stores to see if anyone stocked it. I joked that my day couldn't get started without a mushroom coffee. Nobody knew what I was even talking about.
As the months have passed, I'm learning to take a deep breath and slow myself down, just as the locals do. It's good for your soul, and I've never felt happier.

77,2025-11-27,"Best IT companies in India list: The Indian IT industry is one of the most exciting and fast-growing sectors in the country. Over the years, India has built a strong name in technology, software services and digital innovation. What started decades ago has turned India into a global centre for IT, attracting major international companies while also producing home-grown giants that compete at a world level.
When evaluating the top IT companies in India, several factors usually come into play. These include market value, revenue generation, global reach, level of innovation, and financial performance. Together, these indicators show which companies are truly leading the industry.
Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) stands at the top as the biggest IT company in India in terms of market capitalisation, according to a Forbes report. It is well-known for its strong financial results, large global presence and continuous efforts to adopt new technologies such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence. For the financial year ending March 31, 2025, TCS recorded more than $30 billion in revenue, reflecting its consistent strength.
Right behind TCS is Infosys, another major name in the Indian IT space. Infosys earns around $18 billion annually and gets a large part of its business from digital services such as cloud, AI, IoT and big data. With clients across 59 countries, the company has built deep global relationships and trust over many years.
HCL Technologies is also a key player, known especially for its work in engineering services and research-driven solutions. HCL crossed $13 billion in revenue in 2025 and continues to grow by investing in new ideas, technologies and intellectual property partnerships, which strengthen its market position.
On the global front, companies like Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta Platforms continue to dominate the worldwide technology scene. Their innovations and large-scale digital products influence tech trends everywhere, including in India.
This list captures the top 10 IT companies in India, ranked by market capitalisation based on NSE data as of November 21, 2025.

79,2025-11-27,"It’s widely believed that sales of the iPhone Air have been disappointing and that Apple has either massively reduced or even suspended manufacturing altogether.
A new report says that several Chinese brands have responded by canceling their own plans for similar ultra-slim phones …
Almost immediately after launch, it was noted that the iPhone Air remained available for immediate delivery long after the iPhone 17 Pro was backordered.
A series of follow-up reports all suggested limited interest in the model. One said that Apple’s manufacturing orders had been slashed to almost end of production levels, while a subsequent one said that production of the device had ceased altogether.
Samsung is said to have experienced exactly the same problem with its Galaxy S25 Edge, and has reportedly cancelled next year’s model.
A new supply chain report suggests that Chinese smartphone brands have been paying attention and have decided to cancel their own plans for similar ultra-slim Android phones. DigiTimes aggregated a couple of reports.
Following disappointing sales of Apple’s iPhone Air and tightening supply chains, major Chinese smartphone manufacturers have reportedly frozen or canceled their own “Air” ultra-thin phone projects. Industry sources cited by Sina Finance and Jiemian.com reveal that Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, and others have either scrapped or adjusted development plans for Air models.
I really don't understand this ""flop/failure"" stuff.  I replaced my iPhone 16 Pro Max with the iPhone Air and I have not regretted it for one moment.

It's a better looking phone than the Pro Max.  It's a lighter phone than the Pro Max.  My battery lasts all day every day for my use case.  I miss the telephoto camera now and then, but the photos I do take are still lovely.  And the one speaker rarely presents an issue when my AirPods are in my ears almost all day long.

Is the iMac a failure because more people buy MacBooks?  Is it surprising that some people choose the cheapest iPhone, some choose the most ""Pro"" iPhone, and the one in the middle (while amazing) is a smaller niche overall?  No...not at all.

I ""downgraded"" from the iPad Pro to the iPad Air after years of always getting the Pro models, and you know what?  Other than missing FaceID, I have no regrets.  For my use case, I prefer the MacBook Air over Pro.  I prefer the Mac mini to the Mac Studio.  And I prefer the iPhone Air over the Pro Max now without hesitation.

Most people who chose the Air love it, and those who chose the Pro don't get it.  That's fine.  But I hope Apple moves forward with the Air, because I'd absolutely miss it when it's gone.

Xiaomi, which has built an entire business out of cloning Apple products, was previously reported to have been planning a very close copy of the iPhone Air, but is now said to have cancelled the project.
While Apple never directly reveals sales data for individual products, there does now seem a persuasive amount of evidence that demand for the iPhone Air has proved disappointing.
Couple this to similar reports for Samsung’s ultra-thin phone, and it does appear that there simply isn’t enough of a market for this type of product, at least at the prices charged.

When your phone flashes that annoying low-battery warning at an inconvenient time, you need a reliable solution. We rely on our iPhones for everything, from maps and messages to music and running out of battery during a busy day is not an option. That’s exactly why the Anker magnetic portable charger was made: to give you energy when you need it most without having to deal with cables.
What’s more, Anker is a certified brand that Apple sells and approves. However, if you look in the official store, a similar power bank costs two to three times as much. The price of this Anker 621 magnetic 5,000mAh power bank on Amazon has dropped to an all-time low, going from $39 to an amazing $23 (49% off). You never expect to see that kind of huge savings on high-quality accessories that work with Apple products.
See at Amazon
The best thing about this power bank is that it is easy to carry around and works perfectly with the design of your phone: Anker made this device smaller than ever before by using its new minicell technology which lets it pack the same charging power into fewer parts. This new design gives the user a real advantage: the device is much lighter and smaller than earlier generations. The battery pack is only 4.13 Ã 2.62 Ã 0.45 inchesÂ so it will fit easily into any small pocket, bag, or purse. The weight is only 4.41 ounces, so it doesn’t add much bulk to your daily carry when it’s attached.
This charger is so useful that iPhone users can’t live without it: It has very strong magnets that hold the power bank firmly to the back of your iPhone 15, 14, 13, or 12 series phone. This strong attachment keeps the charger in place even when you’re using your phone. You can easily take stable selfies, hold calls, or scroll through social media with just one hand without worrying about the magnetic connection coming loose. Charging is as easy as pie: just line up your iPhone and battery pack, and you’ll always get a strong, reliable connection.
This exact magnetic alignment gets rid of the common problems with standard, non-magnetic wireless charging pads that cause them to lose connection. It also makes sure that power is always transferred during the charging cycle. Because of the magnetic hold, you can still use all of your phone’s ports while it’s charging. This leaves the USB-C port open for data transfer or another connection.
The 5,000mAh capacity gives you a lot of extra power, which is enough for most modern iPhones to last for several hours of heavy use or a full charge to get you through the rest of the evening. This amount of power is often the best for portable chargers because it gives you a lot of extra battery life without making them too heavy or big to carry. Anker’s minicell technology makes sure that the power output stays fast and efficient, even though the footprint is small. This makes sure that your device gets the power it needs quickly.
Anker includes a 23.6-inch USB-C to USB-C cable that lets you quickly recharge the power bank itself, so you can quickly charge the battery when you get home. Every purchase comes with the peace of mind that it meets international safety standards. This means that you can use it safely even if the battery gets a little warm while charging, which is normal for all high-speed wireless charging. Additionally, Anker backs this product with a 24-month warranty that covers any problems, showing that the company is sure it will last for a long time and be of high quality.
The market for phone accessories is still crowded but not many brands can match the quality and engineering skills of Anker. This deal on Amazon is a great value for money because it lets you get a high-quality, strong magnetic charging solution for the price of cheap, unreliable accessories. Since its original price was just under $40 and similar Apple-branded options cost a lot more, getting this power bank for $23 is a great deal.

82,2025-11-27,"The company said it believes it was Martin Bally's voice on the recording, and condemned the ""vulgar, offensive and false"" comments
Scott Olson/Getty
 Campbell's announced that former executive Martin Bally no longer works at the company following allegations that he made racist remarks and comments about the company’s customers and products.

 The company said in a Wednesday, Nov. 26 statement, that Bally, the former Vice President and chief information security officer, no longer holds his position following the reports of the alleged comments. 

 Bally’s alleged claims were publicized after former employee Robert Garza claimed in a Nov. 20 lawsuit that he was wrongfully terminated by Campbell’s after he reported Bally’s alleged tirade to the company. 

 The lawsuit included a recording of the November 2024 conversation between Garza and Bally. Garza recorded the expletive-laden rant and claimed that Bally made racist comments and allegedly admitted to using drugs at work. (It is legal in Michigan for one person who is party to a conversation to record another person without their consent, per Detroit Free Press, citing attorney Symantha Heath.)

 In Campbell’s statement on Wednesday, the corporation confirmed that it learned of the lawsuit and the audio recording on Nov. 20. ""Neither Mr. Garza nor his lawyer ever notified us of the existence of an audio recording.” 

 The statement continued, adding that after “review,” they “believe the voice on the recording is in fact Martin Bally.” 

 “The comments were vulgar, offensive and false, and we apologize for the hurt they have caused. This behavior does not reflect our values and the culture of our company, and we will not tolerate that kind of language under any circumstances,” the statement read, before concluding that as of Tuesday, Nov. 25, Bally “is no longer employed by the company.”

 Bally’s various comments included remarks about the food, saying that the company makes “highly processed food” for “poor people,” according to WDIV. 

 “We have s--- for f------ poor people. Who buys our s---? I don’t buy Campbell’s products barely anymore. It’s not healthy now that I know what the f---‘s in it,” Bally allegedly said, per the local news outlet. “Bioengineered meat -- I don’t wanna eat a piece of chicken that came from a 3-D printer.”

 In response, Campbell’s said Bally’s alleged comments about the food “are not only inaccurate—they are patently absurd. ” The company said the chicken meat 'comes from long-trusted, USDA-approved U.S. suppliers and meets our high quality standards,' adding that all the soups are made with No Antibiotics Ever chicken meat.

 Campbell’s thanked its customers, saying, “We’re honored by the trust they put in us. We are proud of the food we make, the people who make it and the high-quality ingredients we use to provide consumers with good food at a good value.”

 Bally and Garza met in November 2024 to discuss Garza’s salary; however, during the sit-down, Bally allegedly made the aforementioned comments as well as derogatory comments about Indian employees. 

 “F---ing Indians don’t know a f------ thing,” he said, according to WDIV. “Like they couldn’t think for their f------ selves,” Bally allegedly said, also calling them “idiots.”

 He also allegedly admitted to Garza that he went to work high on marijuana edibles.

 After the conversation, Garza reported Bally’s comments to his direct supervisor, J.D. Aupperle, in January 2025, Garza said in the suit. He claimed he was fired weeks later, on Jan. 30, 2025.

 When PEOPLE reached out to Garza’s attorney, Zachary Runyan, on Monday, Nov. 24, he said the “situation has been very hard” on his client. ""He thought Campbell's would be thankful that he reported Martin's behavior, but instead, he was abruptly fired. We look forward to obtaining justice for Robert.""

 Garza's suit alleges he suffered stress, humiliation, embarrassment and mental anguish due to his supervisor J.D. Aupperle and Bally, CBS News reported. Garza is seeking compensation for emotional, reputational and economic harm, as well as attorneys' fees, according to the outlet.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Keijhon Francis, a 29-year-old communications specialist based in Brooklyn, NY. The following has been edited for length and clarity.
Losing my job last year completely upended my sense of self. I'd never been let go before, and I panicked. 
I'd moved to New York for my job — a communications associate role —  and didn't know how I'd continue to live my life without it. 
I called a friend, and we agreed that after a few hours, I had to stop crying and accept what had happened.
Months later, I'd applied to over 100 jobs, and nothing was working. I withdrew my entire retirement savings just to make ends meet.
The journey taught me that if you're not open to people being there for you, they won't be. So open yourself up to it and let them help.
It was close to the holidays when I was let go, and hiring is usually slow during that time. I decided not to focus too much on my job search right away and to figure it out in the new year.
I started to go stir-crazy with all the time I suddenly had. I had a lot of thoughts going through my head about whether I was good enough or deserved certain levels of respect at work. It altered my self-perception and put me in a bad place mentally.
I was still applying to jobs, but also spent my time taking walks, enjoying New York during the holiday season, and talking to my friends as much as possible because that really helped me level out.
Once the new year arrived, I was home all day, sending in applications as if it were my full-time job.
I applied on LinkedIn and Indeed, and if I saw a job posting on Instagram, I'd send my résumé. I used AI to help tailor my applications, find roles I could apply for with my skill set, and optimize my LinkedIn profile.
By late spring, I realized I needed to be more strategic because I wasn't getting anywhere, and rejection after rejection was wearing on me. I started tailoring my applications heavily to each role and applied to around three suitable roles a day, versus 25 roles with the same generic résumé.
I saw a slight increase in responses after switching my strategy, but still nothing came through.
I went into my retirement account, which had about $10,000, and I withdrew the entire amount as a safety net for myself. I was also receiving about $500 a week in unemployment benefits until May.
In July, I was flat broke with nothing coming in and nothing to fall back on. That got rough. I realized that I needed any job as soon as possible and couldn't focus on my search on a full-time role anymore.
I got a job as a cashier at a local market in Brooklyn. A week later, I added a job as a host at a bar, which I still host at. Those two combined brought me back to being able to make it through the months financially. But I was feeling very negative internally and trying not to show it.
Through attending therapy and dedicating time to working on freelance gigs and mock projects to boost my portfolio, I realized my old role hadn't been the right fit for me and didn't reflect my worth.
Having so many people pray for me, check in, encourage, and uplift me made me realize that I'm loved and worthy of love. It made me feel less alone during one of the most critical periods of my life.
Through some of those really hard moments, when I didn't know how I would make rent or afford food, I'd think of the positives that came with this newfound free time. I was able to see my best friend of 17 years give birth to her first baby. My relationship with my father has grown immensely, which has been incredible.
It was really beautiful to form stronger bonds with those people, as well as gain a deeper understanding of who I am and what I need.
A friend that I used to work with messaged me one day and asked if I was still looking for a job because she knew someone leaving their role, and she thought I would be a great fit.
I immediately applied, and then I didn't hear from them for a couple of weeks. I went through the interview process, which was pretty long. However, I got the call in October that I had landed the job.
I couldn't even let her finish her statement before I started sobbing. It just felt like that chapter of my life was finally closed. It was everything I had been hoping, praying, and fighting for over the last year.
I've learned a great deal about myself and my priorities. When I lost my job, I was feeling so bad about myself because my identity was tied to my work performance in many ways.
I realized that I always wanted to bring my best self to a role, but I never want to lose myself in it again. That's something I'll take with me as I continue to move forward in life.
To anyone newly unemployed: Take it one day at a time. Use this time to figure out what truly makes you happy. Do what you need to do to ensure that your bills are paid and all the necessary things are taken care of, but let the people who love you be there for you.

84,2025-11-27,"From cheap deals on the Vivoactive 6 and Lily 2 to up to hundreds off premium Fenix, Epix, and Venu watches.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Anyone hunting for a Garmin watch has no reason to wait. First, there was a ""Garmin holiday sale"" on many of its best last-generation watches; then, Garmin officially launched its Black Friday sale with hundreds off its newest and best watches, including the Fenix 8. Almost the full lineup is discounted!
Since I have reviewed virtually every Garmin watch of the last few years — with my colleagues handling the rest — I'm well-placed to tell you which is best suited to your lifestyle. Are you a runner or couch-to-5Ker? Gym rat or dedicated 10,000-steps-a-dayer? Whatever the case, I'll point you to the best cheap and splurge options for each category of athlete.
These are the best Garmin watch Black Friday deals that I'd actually buy!
 



If you're new to the Garmin brand, you shouldn't spend close to a grand on a Fenix 8 until you know that you like the Garmin OS and that you will work out enough to justify the switch. While most Garmin watches are expensive, there are a few I'd recommend that give you the essentials for less.
For walkers and beginner gym-goers: The Garmin Vivoactive 6 is ""perfect if you're serious about fitness, but not that serious,"" as our reviewer described it. ""Casual gym-goers"" will appreciate the indoor workout guides with animations and muscle maps for each exercise on your wrist, as well as the accurate HR data and comfortably skinny design. For other casual athletes, you'll get daily walking suggestions, helping you to hit your 10,000 steps a day and lose weight.
The Garmin Vivoactive 6 is a lightweight watch packed with Garmin feature essentials like Body Battery, Sleep Coach, Smart Wake alarm, morning and evening reports to keep you on task, strength and mobility workouts, and post-workout recovery suggestions. It'll help you get (or stay) fit, without overwhelming you with features you don't need.
For women: All of my picks above and below apply to women and men, to be clear, but if you want a particularly stylish Garmin watch that doesn't skimp on fitness tools, the Lily 2 Active is a particular favorite of my sister's, with a gorgeous patterned lens available in multiple colors that disguises how sporty the device is beneath the surface.
or: Garmin Lily 2 for $199 ($50 off) at Best Buy
While the Garmin Lily 2 lasts five days and relies on your phone's GPS, the Lily 2 Active lasts nine days and features its own GPS for more accurate results, especially when working out without a phone on hand. Either device is extremely comfortable for sleep tracking and offers contactless payments, but the Active has perks like Sleep Coaching, meditations, built-in strength/ cardio/ HIIT/ yoga workouts, and extra sports modes that you'll appreciate.
 



As a runner myself, I'd be thrilled with the options available. Every major Forerunner watch of the last few years — 165, 265, 570, 965, and 970 — has a significant discount; you just have to decide how much you're willing to spend.
Beginner runners: The Forerunner 165 is the best running watch for most people because it offers accurate data, daily workout and recovery suggestions, structured Garmin Coach plans, and post-run Training Effect for an affordable price. I highly recommend it for anyone new to Garmin before they start diving into the more advanced metrics.
Matching its all-time low deal price, the Forerunner 165 is a fantastic running watch with 11-day battery life or 19 hours of all-systems GNSS tracking in a lightweight frame, weighing only 39g with the strap. Self-guided runners will get daily suggested runs at different intensity levels to build up their VO2 Max.
Intermediate runners: The Forerunner 265 is a fantastic deal at $150 off, giving you extra battery life, dual-band GPS, Training Readiness estimates, and a training load focus widget that judges whether you need more low-aerobic or anaerobic workouts to improve your VO2 Max, without having to rely on Garmin's workout suggestions.
The Garmin Forerunner 265 has a 1.3-inch AMOLED display, 4th-gen Elevate sensors, dual-band GPS tracking, and the suite of Training Load/ Status/ Readiness that you don't get on the Forerunner 165. That also includes perks like music storage and Garmin Cycling/ Strength Coaching.
Expert runners: This is a much more difficult choice! The Forerunner 965 is a personal favorite, with 23-day battery life and premium perks like real-time stamina, Endurance/ Hill scores offline topographic maps, and Strava Live Segments that serious runners will appreciate, and it's $150-off deal is excellent.
The newer Forerunner 570, which costs the same at $100 off, focuses more on other perks: a 2,000-nit display, fifth-generation HR sensors that are more accurate, a mic & speaker for Bluetooth calling and commands, and the Health Status widget. But it's the Forerunner 970 that combines the best smarts and training tools into one incredible package, if you can afford it.
I wore the Garmin Forerunner 970 for my marathon training, appreciating its strong 15-day battery life, 2,000-nit display for full-color hiking maps, 5th-gen sensors with ECG and skin temperature, dual-band GPS, and the running tolerance metric that judges how much biomechanical impact your body can handle before you should slow your training.
 



If you're someone who spends lots of time hiking or rucking on trails, Garmin watches will give you the ruggedness, accurate GPS in challenging conditions, and maps that you'll need to enjoy the wilderness safely.
Affordable battery life: The Garmin Instinct 3 is the obvious recommendation, especially at $100 off. It has MIL-STD-810 and 10ATM ratings for durability, with a design that looks bulky but is lighter than it looks. You can choose the MIP option and get ""unlimited"" battery life thanks to a hyper-efficient Solar glass panel, or the AMOLED option that's kinder on your eyes but still hits 18–24 days of battery life, depending on the size you pick.
or: Garmin Instinct 3 AMOLED 45mm: $449.99 $349.99 at Best Buy
If you value long life in your fitness watches, the Garmin Instinct 3 Solar is one of the best options around, harnessing the sun to deliver weeks of extra battery life per charge if you spend enough time outdoors. You also get tools like dual-band GPS, a flashlight, training load insights with daily workout suggestions, and other Garmin tools you know and love.
Affordable premium option: While I could recommend a Fenix 8 Pro for its cellular and satellite connectivity, most people aren't going to buy a $1,099 ($100 off) deal. Instead, I'll point most hikers to the Epix Pro (Gen 2), which gives you 90% of the same perks as a Fenix 8 for significantly less, including an AMOLED display with sapphire glass, fifth-generation sensors for the best accuracy, a flashlight for your tent at night, a stylish titanium bezel, and offline maps to navigate tricky trails.
or Epix Pro (Gen 2) 47mm: $749.99 $499.99 ($250 off) at Best Buy
Depending on which size you buy, you'll get 16 or 31 days of battery life, or 42 to 82 GPS hours, with the premium Garmin tools that hikers will appreciate: topographic maps of your region, the ClimbPro widget showing how steep upcoming hills on your route will be, a rucking mode that takes pack weight into account, and a Hill score judging how good you are at handling elevation changes.
 



If you're someone willing to spend Fenix-level money on a Garmin, then go for it! The Fenix 8 is $250 off on Best Buy, hitting the lowest price we've ever seen, and you'll get the best features available. That said, I want to point you to some options that are a bit more affordable, but still give you a fantastic all-around experience.
Best Garmin watch: The Garmin Venu 4 is the ""ideal fitness watch for everyone,"" making significant upgrades over its predecessor in style, GPS accuracy, and training tools, essentially cramming the smarts of a Forerunner into a more attractive design for those who aren't a fan of Garmin's typical plastic-heavy, five-button aesthetic.
The Garmin Venu 4 just got its first official sale shortly after launch, bringing the price slightly down closer to the original $449 price of the Venu 3. You get Garmin's new Health Status and Lifestyle Logging widgets, dual-band GPS, a mic & speaker, a flashlight, and a new Garmin Fitness Coach that combines indoor and outdoor workouts into a balanced, personalized plan for casual or serious athletes.
Best for Apple Watch converts: I have a particular soft spot for the Venu X1, which doesn't look anything like a traditional Garmin watch. It's incredibly skinny (7.9mm), lightweight (40g with strap), and large (2-inch, 2,000-nit AMOLED), with the premium features you'd get from the Forerunner 970. Choose this if you like the Apple Watch Ultra 3 aesthetic but would rather charge it every eight days instead of two.
The Garmin Venu X1 gives you Fenix-level perks like offline hiking or golf course maps, running impact load and real-time stamina, and Hill/ Endurance scores, in a design that weighs about half as much as a Fenix 8 and (thanks to this Black Friday deal) costs hundreds less, too. Weigh the Venu 4 vs. X1 to see whether this is the right fit for you.
 



Black Friday is set for November 28th, which is the day after the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States. Although the official date is still a week away, I'm finding that retailers are launching their sales much earlier than recent years, so don't wait if you see a Low Stock warning on one of your desired items.
Retailers like Amazon and Best Buy tend to have the best Garmin watch deals this time of year, but it never hurts to check Garmin.com to see what official discounts are available. If you don't mind using refurbished tech, you can also check sites like Backmarket.com for hefty discounts on renewed smartwatches.
Although it's really going to depend on your individual needs, we generally consider the Venu 4 to be one of the best Garmin watches for most folks. This is namely due to the watch's approachable price tag, high-end fitness features, and battery life. You can check our guide on the best Garmin watches for a more in-depth look at our top nine picks for every category.

Apple iOS

After 14 years, Apple is once again poised to overtake Samsung as the global leader in terms of smartphone shipments. According to Counterpoint Research, Apple is projected to ship over 243 million iPhones in 2025, which would give it an estimated 19.4% share of the global smartphone market. Samsung, which is the current global leader, is expected to ship 235 million units, which would leave it with an 18.7% market share.
The iPhone 17 series has proven to be a huge success for Apple as shipments in Q3 saw 9% growth compared to last year’s 16 series. Furthermore, Apple saw 12% higher demand for the 17 series in the first four weeks after its launch in the US. The figures in China for the same period were 18% higher than last year.
In addition, Apple is riding a favorable wave as consumers who bought a smartphone during the COVID-19 pandemic are now in their upgrade cycle. The gap between Apple and Samsung is expected to widen in the coming years as Cupertino is projected to maintain its position as the global smartphone shipments leader through 2029.

91,2025-11-27," A group representing major stock exchanges has urged the SEC to abandon its plan to grant an “innovation exemption” to brokers and crypto firms seeking to offer tokenized stocks. 
The US Securities and Exchange Commission shouldn’t grant broad regulatory relief to crypto companies launching tokenized stock offerings, a stock exchange advocacy group has argued. 
The World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) said in a Nov. 21 letter to the SEC  that it was “alarmed at the plethora of brokers and crypto-trading platforms offering or intending to offer so-called tokenized US stocks.”
“These products are marketed as stock tokens or the equivalent to stocks when they are not,” the group said. “This development poses multiple and interconnected risks.”
Multiple crypto exchanges are seeking to offer tokenized stocks in the US, allowing investors to buy exposure to public companies without owning shares. They’re touted as having faster settlements compared to stock exchanges and can be traded at any time, not just during market hours.
Crypto companies that aren’t SEC-registered broker-dealers would have to get an exemption from the agency, and its chair, Paul Atkins, has floated granting one.
The WFE, which counts Cboe and the Nasdaq as members, said it supports the SEC using exemptive relief, but it is “concerned that the broad use of such relief presents risks to investors and market integrity.”
“We simply believe that this authority is most effective when exercised in a targeted manner and not applied as a means to circumvent or fast-track exemptions to longstanding regulatory requirements,” it added.
The WFE said tokenization “is likely a natural evolution in capital markets” and that it was “pro-innovation,” but that it “must be done in a responsible way that does not put investors or market integrity at risk.”
The group said it would be better for the SEC to make a public rule filing to garner feedback rather than to “seek to make large-scale changes with exemptive relief.”
“Alternatively, the Commission could consider the creation of a sandbox regime or other innovation facilitator,” it added.
In August, the WFE urged the SEC, the European Securities and Markets Authority and the International Organization of Securities Commissions for stricter oversight of tokenized stocks, arguing they lacked investor protections. 
Atkins, a former crypto lobbyist, has said he’s considering an “innovation exemption” to relieve crypto firms from certain regulations, thereby speeding up the process of bringing crypto and blockchain products to market.

“An innovation exemption could help fulfill President Trump’s vision to make America the crypto capital of the planet by encouraging developers, entrepreneurs, and other firms that are willing to comply with certain conditions to innovate with onchain technologies in the United States,” he told a group of crypto executives at a meeting in June.
US trading platforms have begun lining up to offer tokenized stocks under the crypto-friendly SEC. Robinhood Markets began offering hundreds of tokenized stocks to European investors in June, with the intention of bringing the same products to the US, following a similar offer by Kraken a month earlier.
Coinbase also reportedly sought SEC approval in June to offer tokenized stocks, with its legal chief, Paul Grewal, saying it was a “huge priority” for the crypto exchange.
Non-crypto companies are also getting in on the action. In September, Nasdaq requested a rule change with the SEC to allow the exchange to list tokenized stocks.

International Box Office Editor/Senior Contributor

Lee Sang-il’s kabuki drama Kokuho has set a new record in Japan, becoming the highest-grossing Japanese live-action film ever in the market with over $111M at the local box office. The Ken Watanabe-starrer is Japan’s entry for the International Feature Oscar and was released for one-week qualifying runs by GKids in the U.S. on November 14 in Los Angeles and November 21 in New York. The estimated gross for those engagements is more than $60K.

	Originally debuting in Directors’ Fortnight at Cannes last May, the movie hit Japanese cinemas on June 6 and continues to play. As of earlier this week, after 172 days in theaters, the film has sold over 12.3 million tickets and surpassed ¥17,377,394,500 ($111M).

Kokuho’s performance breaks a 22-year-old record previously held by 2003’s Bayside Shakedown 2, according to local reporting service Kogyo Tsushinsha. It is now the No. 11 movie ever in the market. Per the same service, there are only two live-action movies in the Top 10: Titanic and Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone. 




			Watch on Deadline		






Kokuho‘s story begins in 1964 Nagasaki when, following the death of his yakuza gang leader father, 14-year-old Kikuo is taken under the wing of famous kabuki actor Hanjiro Hanai (Watanabe). Alongside Shunsuke, the actor’s only son, Kikuo decides to dedicate himself to this traditional form of theater. For decades, the two young men grow and evolve together – from acting school to the grandest stages – amid scandals and glory, brotherhood and betrayals… one of them will become the greatest Japanese master of the art of kabuki. Ryo Yoshizawa and Ryusei Yokohama play the friends/rivals. 

	During Cannes, Lee told us that “even in Japan, it’s been 80 years since a movie has had Kabuki as the theme. You can see, just by that metric, kabuki is something that is very difficult to adapt to cinema. I think that there’s this very secretive aspect to kabuki between protecting the bloodlines and hierarchy.” Lee also said that training the actors in the art of kabuki took a year-and-a-half. Watanabe concurred, “It’s hard work… The child actors and the adults, I have really deep respect for their commitment… The performance in the theaters is just 30 minutes, but we shot 10 hours more.”

	










Kokohu is produced by Aniplex in association with Myriagon Studio, Amuse Inc, Toho Co Ltd., Lawson Inc. and Credeus. GKids will release the film wide in North American theaters early next year. 

	“We’d like to congratulate the Kokuho film team on this incredible milestone,” said GKids’ President Dave Jesteadt. “The historic box office success in Japan demonstrates that the film is a must-see theatrical event, with many Japanese audiences returning to cinemas multiple times to experience its immersive beauty. After our own sold-out previews, we look forward to sharing this deeply emotional modern classic with American audiences early next year.” 

	The film is based on the novel of the same name by Shuichi Yoshida and written by Satoko Okudera. Other festival play has included TIFF and AFI.

Exclusive data about the AI Search funding landscape reveals the true upside of the market – and potential down rounds.
Adobe just paid $1.9 billion for Semrush. Not for the LLM tracking dashboards. For the platform, the customer relationships, and the distribution.
Contrast: Investors poured $227 million into AI visibility tracking. Most of that went to tracking dashboards. The companies shipping outputs from agentic SEO raised a third of that. Adobe’s acquisition proves dashboards were never the point.
Investors chased LLM monitoring because it looked like easy SaaS, but the durable value sits in agentic SEO tools that actually ship work. Why? Because agentic SEO goes beyond the traditional SEO tooling setup, and offers SEO professionals and agencies a completely new operational capability that can augment (or doom) their business.
Together with Wordlift, Growth Capital, Niccolo Sanarico, Primo Capital, and G2, I analyzed the funding data and the companies behind it. The pattern is clear: Capital chased what sounded innovative. The real opportunity hid in what actually works.
We looked at 80 companies and their collective $1.5 billion in venture funding:
AI visibility tracking seemed like the obvious problem in 2024 because every CMO asked the same question: “How does my brand show up in ChatGPT?” It’s still not a solved problem: We don’t have real user prompts, and responses vary significantly. But measuring is not defensible. The vast number of startups providing the same product proves it.
Monitoring tools have negative switching costs. Agentic tools have high switching costs.
Venture capital collectively invested +$200 million because companies care about how and where they show up on the first new channel since Alphabet, Meta, and TikTok. The AI visibility industry has the potential to be bigger than the SEO industry (~$75 billion) because Brand and Product Marketing departments care about AI visibility as well.
What they missed is how fast that trend becomes infrastructure. Amplitude proved it was commoditizable by offering monitoring for free. When Semrush added it as a checkbox, the category collapsed.
Outcomes trump insights. In 2025, the value of AI is getting things done. Monitoring is table stakes.
73% of AI visibility tracking companies were founded in 2024 and raised $12 million on average. That check size is typically reserved for scale-stage companies with proven market-fit.
Our analysis reveals a massive maturity gap between where capital flowed and where value lives.
Despite being more mature, the agentic layer raised one-third as much capital as the monitoring layer. Why? Because investors missed the moat.
Investors dislike “shipping” tools at the seed stage because they require integration, approval workflows, and “human-in-the-loop” setup. To a VC, this looks like low-margin consulting. Monitoring tools look like perfect SaaS: 90% gross margins, instant onboarding, and zero friction.
Money optimized for ease of adoption and missed ease of cancellation.
Capital flowed to the “clean” financials of monitoring, leaving the “messy” but durable execution layer underfunded. That is where the opportunity sits.
Three capabilities separate the winners from the features:
The difference is simple: one group solves “how do I know?” and the other solves “how do I ship?”
The market sorts into three tiers based on defensibility:
1. Established platforms win by commoditizing. Semrush and Ahrefs have customer relationships spanning two decades. They’ve already added LLM monitoring as a feature. They now need to move faster on the action layer – the workflow automation that helps marketers create and distribute assets at scale. Their risk isn’t losing relevance. It’s moving too slowly while specialized startups prove out what’s possible.
The challenge: Established platforms are read-optimized; agentic operations require write-access. Semrush and Ahrefs built 20-year moats on indexing the web (Read-Only). Moving to agentic SEO requires them to write back to the customer’s CMS (Write-Access).
2. Agentic SEO platforms scale into the gap. They’re solving real operational constraints with sticky products. AirOps is proving the thesis: $40 million Series B, $225 million valuation. Their product lives in the action layer – content generation, maintenance, rich media automation. Underfunded today, they capture follow-on capital tomorrow.
3. Monitoring tools consolidate or disappear. Standalone AI visibility vendors have 18 months to either build execution layers on top of their dashboards or find an acquirer. The market doesn’t support single-function tracking at venture scale.
Q3/Q4 2026 could be an “Extinction Event.” This is when the 18-month runway from the early 2024 hype cycle runs out. Companies will go to market to raise more money, fail to show the revenue growth required to support their 2024 valuations, and be forced to:
Let’s do some basic “Runway Math”:
To raise their next round (Series B) and extend their life, AI visibility companies must justify the high valuation of their previous round. But to justify a Series A valuation (likely $50-$100 million post-money given the AI hype), they need to show roughly 3x-5x ARR growth year-over-year. Because the product is commoditized by free tools like Amplitude and bundled features from Semrush, they might miss that 5x revenue growth target.
Andrea Volpini, Founder and CEO of Wordlift:
After 25 years, the Semantic Web has finally arrived. The idea that agents can reach a shared understanding by exchanging ontologies and even bootstrap new reasoning capabilities is no longer theoretical. It is how the human-centered web is turning into an agentic, reasoning web while most of the industry is caught off guard. When Sir Tim Berners-Lee warns that LLMs may end up consuming the web instead of humans, he is signaling a seismic shift. It is bigger than AI Search. It is reshaping the business model that has powered the web for three decades. This AI Map is meant to show who is laying the foundations of the reasoning web and who is about to be left behind.
From Niccolo Sanarico, writer of The Week in Italian Startups and Partner at Primo Capital:
Let’s leave the funding data for a moment, and shift to the demand side of the market: on the one hand, Google integrating AI search results on its SERP, ChatGPT or Perplexity becoming the entry point for search and discovery, are phenomena that are creating a change in user behavior – and when users change behavior, new giants emerge. On the other hand, SEO has historically been a consulting-like, human-driven, tool-enabled effort, but its components (data monitoring & analysis, content ideation & creation, process automation) are the bread and butter of the current generation of AI, and we believe there is a huge space for emerging AI platforms to chip away at the consulting side of this business. Unsurprisingly, 42% of the companies in our dataset were founded on or after 2020, despite the oldest and greatest players dating back more than 20 years, and the key message they are passing is “let us do the work.”
The numbers validate this thesis at scale. Even though it is not always easy to size it, recent research finds that the SEO market represents a $166 billion opportunity split between tools ($84.94 billion) and services ($81.46 billion), growing at 13%+ annually. But the distribution reveals the disruption opportunity: agencies dominate with 55% market share in services, while 60% of enterprise spend flows to large consulting relationships. This $50+ billion consulting layer – built on manual processes, relationship-dependent expertise, and human-intensive workflows – sits directly in AI’s disruption path.
The workforce data tells the automation story. With >200,000 SEO professionals globally and median salaries in the US of $82,000 (15% above U.S. national average), we’re looking at a knowledge worker category ripe for productivity transformation. The job market shifts already signal this transition: content-focused SEO roles declined 28% in 2024 as AI automation eliminated routine work, while leadership positions grew 50-58% as the focus shifted to strategy and execution oversight. When 90% of new SEO positions come from companies with 250+ employees, and these organizations are simultaneously increasing AI tool budgets from 5% to 15% of total SEO spend, the path forward is clear: AI platforms that can deliver execution velocity will capture the value gap between high-cost consulting and lower-margin monitoring tools.
Stop asking “Is it AI-powered?” Ask instead:
You’re at an inflection point:
When evaluating opportunities, ask: “What would need to happen for Semrush or Ahrefs to provide this?” If the answer is “not much,” it’s not defensible at venture scale. If they had to rebuild core infrastructure or cannibalize part of their product, you have a moat.
The best signal isn’t which companies are raising capital, but which categories are raising capital despite low defensibility. That’s where you find the upside.
Your strategic question isn’t “Which category should I enter?” It’s “How deeply integrated will I be in my customers’ workflows?” If you’re building monitoring tools, you have 18 months. Either build an execution layer on top of your dashboard or optimize for acquisition.
If you’re building execution platforms, defensibility comes from three things:
The winning companies are those that solve problems needing continuous domain expertise and cannot be easily copied. Automated workflows that understand brand guidelines, customer segments, and channel-specific best practices aren’t.
Ask yourself: What operational constraint am I solving that requires judgment calls, not just better AI? If the answer is “I’m just generating better content faster,” you’re building a feature. If the answer is “I’m managing complexity across dozens of channels while enforcing consistency,” you’re building a platform.
