A week after a toy company pulled its AI-powered teddy bear off the market due to child safety concerns, the company has returned its dystopian stuffed animal to virtual shelves. FoloToy, which sells a stuffed toy named “Kumma,” says that it has made safety upgrades to the toy and that it is once again ready for playtime.Â Â 
âAfter a full week of rigorous review, testing, and reinforcement of our safety modules, we have begun gradually restoring product sales,â the company said in a statement shared on social media Monday. âAs global attention on AI toy safety continues to rise, we believe that transparency, responsibility, and continuous improvement are essential. FoloToy remains firmly committed to building safe, age-appropriate AI companions for children and families worldwide.â
The move comes not long after the Public Interest Research Group, a non-profit that focuses on consumer protection advocacy, publishedÂ a report finding that the toy had engaged in a variety of weird and inappropriate conversations with its researchers. Those researchers found that, with a little prompting, Kumma would talk about pretty much anythingâfrom where to find matches and knives to best practices for BDSM. Indeed, researchers say they were âsurprised to find how quickly Kumma would take a single sexual topic [they] introduced into the conversation and run with it.â
Not long afterward, OpenAIâwhose algorithm was powering Kumma’s chat capabilitiesâcut the company off. âWe suspended this developer for violating our policies,â a company spokesperson told Gizmodo last week. âOur usage policies prohibit any use of our services to exploit, endanger, or sexualize anyone under 18 years old.”
Now, it would appear that the company has had its suspension revoked. FoloToy’s website currently states that its toys are “powered by GPT-4o.” On Monday, FoloToy also shared that it had conducted “a deep, company-wide internal safety audit,” upgraded its conversational safeguards, and “deployed enhanced safety rules and protections through our cloud-based system.” Gizmodo reached out to FoloToy and OpenAI for more information about the changes.
The company has described its product lineup as “a collection of AI Conversation toys that harnesses the latest AI technology and the power of love,” and it’s not the only company that offers these kinds of products. Many other companies were named in PIRG’s report as providing AI-powered toys to children, and, like FoloToy, they all exhibited problematic behavior. The future, brought to you by the AI revolution, is basically some weird mix of M3GAN and Ted. Get used to it.

The housing market is still largely frozen, and sellers don't seem to be in any rush to help it thaw. 
More than 84,000 home sellers yanked their homes off the market in September, according to a new report from Redfin. That marks a 28% increase from the number of homes that were delisted the prior year, and the highest pace of pulled listings in any September in eight years, the real estate listings site said.
The firm said it counted a home as ""delisted"" if a listing was pulled from the market for at least 31 days without a sale or a pending sale.
Delistings, which tend to surge in the winter months, appear to be rising due to continued weak demand from buyers, many of whom have been sidelined from the housing market in recent years due to affordability concerns and high mortgage rates.
But sellers seem unwilling to dial down their asking price, even as bidders dry up, according to Asad Khan, a senior economist at Redfin.
The average home that was delisted in September was on the market for around 100 days, according to Redfin's analysis.
The percentage of home listings in the US that were considered ""stale,"" or on the market for at least 60 days without a pending sale, also clocked in at 70% in September, the firm said.
""More sellers are giving up because their homes have been sitting on the market for a long time, and they don't want to or can't afford to settle on accepting a low price,"" Khan wrote in a statement.
Home prices are still hovering near record highs, but are starting to cool as activity in the housing market wanes. The median sale price of a home in the US dropped to $410,800 in the second quarter, according to the Census Bureau.
Nationwide, home values ticked up 1.3% year-over-year in September, according to the S&P Cotality Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index, the slowest pace of growth recorded in about two years.

One often overlooked accessory in this journey is the mouse. Sure, that cheap $10 one you picked up at the checkout counter last time you were at Staples gets the job done, but a mouse can be so much more than you might realize.
The Logitech MX Master 3S will kick your computer use up a notch, when gaming or otherwise. It’s normally listed at Amazon for an even $100, but this early Black Friday deal has the mouse discounted by 20%.

You have enough on your mind during the holidays, why not free yourself from the fear of your laptop or desktop meeting with a catastrophic demise and taking all of your precious data and files with it? There’s a Black Friday deal for that right now at Amazon â save $30 off the price of the 5TB model of WB’s Elements portable external hard drive for Windows or Mac. Take a quick break from shopping for family and friends and give yourself the best gift of all â peace of mind.
That might sound extreme, but saving yourself from losing your data and files due to a massive hardware failure, an accident, or even an act of nature is well worth the new $110 price tag on the 5TB WB Elements. Many of the items on your PC or Mac are probably irreplaceable, like digital family movies or digitized photos, official documents that you’ve scanned into digital form, work files, archived emails, and more. A fast backup to a reliable portable hard drive is an essential step toward keeping your files safe, and the WD Elements is among the very best.
See at Amazon
The 5TB capacity of this WB Elements portable external hard drive is likely more than enough to back up your entire desktop or laptop, and possibly consolidate any files you’ve had floating around on thumb drives or smaller external hard drives. The longest file transfer is always the first one, but the WB Elements drive moves at USB 3.0 speed up to 5Gbps while also being retro-compatible with USB 2.0 devices. You should note it’s a USB-A device, not USB-C.
All those files may be hogging hard drive space on your computer, but the WB Elements backup drive will most definitely not hog space on your actual desktop. It’s a tiny, sleek device measuring only 3.2 by 4.35 inches and a scant 8.32 ounces, so it’s literally pocket-sized and more than able to hitch a ride in your backpack or briefcase.
The drive comes formatted for Windows 10, 8.1, and 7.1 for plug-and-play usage. It’s also Mac-compatible after a quick and easy reformatting process that your Mac or MacBook will walk you through.
The full range of WD Elements portable external hard drives, ranging from 1TB to 6TB, are beginning to hit Black Friday pricing. But this 5TB model is by far the best deal so far at 21% off its regular $140 price. If you’re really concerned about keeping your files safe, a great way to take advantage of this awesome deal is to buy two WD Elements drives, with one intended to be stored somewhere away from your home in case of fire or other natural disaster.
WD’s rep as one of the best storage drive manufacturers has been decades in the making, starting with the My Book line that debuted in 2006. The 2007 model My Book was one of the first terabyte-sized drives to hit the consumer market. The physical size of these drives has shrunk dramatically while the storage levels have soared, and the prices have never been friendlier than they are now. Hit this Amazon Black Friday deal on the 5TB WD Elements drive for just $110 and sleep easier knowing your files are safe and secure.

6,2025-11-25,"This deal is good enough to grab Android users' attention.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Apple took a big swing with the AirPods Pro 3 this year, and while they won't be for everyone as a result, these earbuds will be the absolute best for most people. I reviewed the AirPods Pro 3, and found them to have the best active noise-canceling performance of any pair of wireless earbuds I've tested. They've only been out for a few months, and that's why it's incredible to see AirPods Pro 3 already discounted to $219.99 on Amazon.
The same deal is live on Best Buy, Target, and Walmart as well, and it means now is the perfect time to save on AirPods Pro 3 as Black Friday approaches. It's the lowest price we've ever seen for this model of AirPods, down from their usual $249.99 retail price. Here's who the AirPods Pro 3 is (and isn't) made for.
AirPods Pro 3: $249.00 $219.99 at Amazon
We don't cover Apple products very often, but some devices are simply too good to miss. The AirPods Pro 3 feature a new design, more bass, and better active noise-canceling quality. The earbuds last longer on a single charge and use a hybrid silicone-foam ear tip design for security, comfort, and better passive sound isolation. For some, they'll be the best-sounding AirPods yet.
Price comparison: Best Buy - $219.99 | Walmart - $219.99
✅Recommended if: you need the best ANC earbuds, you want earbuds with a heart-rate monitor, you like a bassy sound profile.
❌Skip this deal if: you like the design and sound of AirPods Pro 2; you don't like the in-ear feel of foam ear tips.
There are a few things to know about the AirPods Pro 3, starting with their ANC and sound quality prowess. Apple calls it ""the world's best ANC of any in-ear wireless headphones,"" and I absolutely believe it. The AirPods Pro 3 can turn almost any environment into near-silence, without needing to play any background music to drown out compressed ambient sound. Other earbuds like AirPods Pro 2 and Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 can get close, but nothing surpasses AirPods Pro 3.
Additionally, the sound quality, though a bit bass-heavy, is stellar. There's the advanced Apple H2 audio processor inside to handle sound and ANC quality. Despite all the inner-workings going on to provide best-in-class ANC power, these earbuds still last for eight hours on a single charge.
From a design and comfort standpoint, Apple changed the angle at which the ear tips enter your ear canal to be more comfortable for most. They're now foam tips wrapped in silicone, so they won't fall out of your ears as easily and will passively block more noise. Some people, including myself, find the new design to be less comfortable. However, if you've found the usual AirPods design to be comfortable in the past, the AirPods Pro 3 should fit just fine.
Combined with the best ANC you can find in a pair of earbuds, AirPods Pro 3 are a compelling package. At $30 off, these are some of the best you can find for just $220 for a limited time. And thanks to holiday return policies from stores like Amazon and Best Buy, you can try them out worry-free into January 2026.

For a time, the four-day workweek seemed like it just might happen.
Like pandemic-era fixations we thought would last forever — looking at you, sourdough starter — the dream of working 32 hours a week for 40 hours' pay seemed within reach for some.
Now, years later, hiring is sluggish, CEOs are demanding that workers lock in, and 9-9-6 memes can feel as pervasive as 6-7 mishegoss.
The chill settling over the workplace means that many workers' hopes for four-day weeks are on ice — for now.
There appears to be ""a pushback from management on the things that workers were gaining during the pandemic,"" said Juliet Schor, a Boston College economist who has researched shorter workweeks.
Yet the idea of permanent three-day weekends isn't dead, Schor and other backers told Business Insider. Instead, thanks to return-to-office orders and companies' relentless focus on AI, broader adoption might simply take longer than advocates might hope.
One challenge, for now, is that the four-day talk doesn't always jibe with narratives about doubling down on work. Some leaders have tired of discussions about work-life balance, and big employers, in particular, have been calling workers back to their cubicles.
In some ways, ideas like 9-9-6 — slogging from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week — are a response to the four-day workweek, Schor said.
That's even though trials from the UK to New Zealand run by Schor and other researchers have indicated that spending less time on the job can leave workers happier and less burned out — without compromising productivity.
For now, many CEOs are focused on the merits of RTO and the need to hustle. Some of that sober speech is a way for big bosses to signal to boards and investors that their employees will work harder than ever, said Vishal Reddy, executive director of WorkFour, a nonprofit that advocates for making the four-day, 32-hour workweek the standard.
""Part of it, I think, is a performance,"" he said of CEOs' directives.
Reddy said another reason there is less buzz about a four-day workweek is that the idea is no longer as novel as it was in 2020 and 2021, when some employers, looking to attract and retain workers, implemented the concept.
Carrying the idea forward, he said, will likely require waiting for the market to change and for workers to regain power.
Reddy said that he sees proposed legislation involving four-day workweek pilots in New York and Maine as signs that supporters haven't given up on the concept.
There are still a number of examples of companies that have adopted shorter schedules. In nearly all cases, once employers adopt the schedule, they don't go back, Reddy said.
The challenges to adopting shorter weeks aren't just practical considerations, like how to meet customers' demands that someone picks up the phone on a Friday.
To make it feasible for employers to pay people the same for working one day less, the economy would have to really take off — growing in the high single digits or even double digits, said Pavel Shynkarenko, founder and CEO of Mellow, a contractor-management platform.
One factor that could help: AI.
If the technology can crank up workers' productivity enough, a shorter week could be doable, Shynkarenko said. Having only four days on the clock could also help prevent widespread unemployment due to AI by spreading work among more people.
Essentially, the four-day workweek would serve as a ""safe harbor"" for the economy as it transitions to one where bots take on more of the tasks that now fall to humans, Shynkarenko said.
One day, he said, AI could make it so that even a four-day workweek would be unnecessary. Workweeks might only last two days, he said. Regardless, any departure from five days as the norm would likely take years, Shynkarenko said.
Until AI can do more heavy lifting, Shynkarenko said, there will be little room for discussion of truncated weeks because employers will face too much cost pressure.
Plus, in ultra-competitive industries like tech, an abbreviated workweek could be seen as a concession to competitors.
Schor, the economist, doesn't expect that employers will be able to avoid the issue indefinitely, however. That's because although workers' stress and burnout rates have improved from COVID-19 crisis levels, progress has plateaued, and remains above pre-pandemic levels, she said.
""We're still in that level of heightened stress,"" Schor said.
Even if economic growth were to occur at a rapid enough pace to allow for a four-day workweek, other factors might still arise. One is that, in some cases, employees might feel a sense of shame about working less, said Dale Whelehan, an assistant professor in systems psychology at Trinity College Dublin, who supports shorter workweeks. Until January, he served as CEO of 4 Day Week Global, a nonprofit advocating for less time on the clock.
""There was such an internalized sense of guilt towards not working hard enough or not performing hard enough,"" he said, referring to what can happen at organizations that try out shorter weeks.
Nevertheless, Whelehan said, the benefits to worker well-being and companies' performance are substantial enough that the conversation about the four-day workweek, which has been dampened for now, ""is going to rise again.""

Now is a great time to upgrade your tech for less. Black Friday is just around the corner, and early deals are coming in hot. Those looking to grab a new laptop this shopping season, whether for themselves or a loved one, should consider bagging the heavily discounted 15-inch Dell Inspiron 3530 at Amazon.
This machine typically retails for around $4,000, but Amazon is offering it at a whopping 80% discount, which brings the down to just $798. And as if that wasn’t enough, the retailer is also throwing in a Redragon keyboard and mouse kit for absolutely nothing. Windows 11 Pro comes pre-installed, too, so you’re saving on that front as well.
The only catch? This deal, at the time of writing, is only available to Prime members. Non-Prime members will still see it at its normal, not-so-friendly $4,000 tag. That said, if you’re planning to shop heavy during the main event, now is a good time to jump on a Prime membership. It lets you enjoy fast, free shipping with your purchases, access member-only deals, and unlock early discounts. The retailer offers a 30-day free trial to new users. After that, you can expect to pay around $15 a month.
See at Amazon
In a fairly minimal design, the laptop offers a 15.6-inch Full HD IPS touchscreen. 220 nits of brightness push clear, vibrant visuals, while the anti-glare coating keeps reflections at bay. Touch support makes navigation a breeze. Not in the mood to use the trackpad or drag the mouse around? Just use your fingers directly on the screen to perform tasks. Pinch for a wider view, stretch to zoom in, swipe away, scroll long documents, or maybe use the on-screen keyboard to take notes; the possibilities are endless.
Just above the screen is a solid 720p HD webcam that makes it easy to catch up with friends and hop on meetings without needing an external camera.
This machine runs on the updated 10-core Intel Core i5-1334U processor, which handles both everyday school and work tasks like a pro. The chip is paired with a massive 32GB DDR4 RAM for snappier multitasking, and a 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD for quicker boot times. You’ll be able to perform a whole bunch of tasks (researching, writing, taking video calls) simultaneously without a hint of lag, which makes the laptop ideal for creatives who need to hop through different programs at the same time. The 1TB SSD provides plenty of space to store your important data, whether it’s hundreds of photos, a ton of videos, or unusually large research papers. The capacity should be enough for most users out there, unless you’re looking to house ever-growing libraries of media files without relying on external solutions.
Connectivity options are plenty. You’ll enjoy a stable, wireless connection with WiFi 6 and Bluetooth, plus be able to connect a range of external peripherals using the built-in ports. Speaking of peripherals, the free kit gets you a solid Redragon laptop keyboard and mouse. The former is quite lightweight and comes with detachable keys. The mouse has a sturdy feel, and is quite comfortable to use for longer sessions.
Windows 11 Pro comes pre-installed, meaning you don’t have to worry about any complicated installation procedures to get started. Microsoft has loaded the operating system with a bunch of useful productivity and security features that are ideal for remote workers, business owners, creatives, and even students. Just note that Microsoft Office isn’t included, and you will need to purchase it separately later if needed.
Overall, the Dell Inspiron 15 3530 touchscreen laptop is a great option to consider for both work and play, especially at its current price. You’re saving more than $3,200 on this powerhouse. Grab the deal before it’s too late.

Black Friday typically means massive LEGO discounts on Amazon with fans waiting to finally pick up those sets they have been eyeing all year at reasonable prices. This year feels a bit like a disappointment as the number of discounted sets fell significantly compared to previous years.
One of the most iconic Star Wars sets managed to make it through with a proper deal, though: the R2-D2 building set dropped to $79 from its usual $99 price tag, and reaches an all-time low that makes this the perfect time to grab it. Star Wars is LEGO’s most popular licensed theme and R2-D2 stands as one of the franchise’s most beloved characters, so getting this particular set on sale feels like winning the Black Friday lottery.
See at Amazon
The 1,050-piece construction gives you a satisfying build session that takes several hours without becoming frustratingly complex, hitting that sweet spot where you’re engaged but not pulling your hair out over confusing instructions. You assemble R2-D2’s iconic dome head with 360-degree rotation capability, letting you position him looking in any direction once he’s on display. The detachable third leg recreates the droid’s mobility configuration from the films, adding an authentic detail that fans immediately recognize and appreciate. Attachable tools and a periscope give you multiple display options, so you can swap accessories based on your mood or recreate specific scenes from the movies.
The finished model stands over 9 inches tall, 6 inches wide, and 4 inches deep, and makes it substantial enough to command attention on a shelf without dominating an entire room like some of Lego’s massive Ultimate Collector Series sets. Once completed, build quality feels solid, with sturdy connections that let you pick up and reposition the model without pieces falling off every time you touch it. Color accuracy is perfect and matches R2-D2’s blue and white scheme with just the right shades that make the droid instantly recognizable even from across a room.
The included 25th-anniversary Darth Malak minifigure adds collectible value beyond just the main R2-D2 build by giving you a character from the expanded Star Wars universe that doesn’t appear in many sets. The information plaque and display stand, decorated with the LEGO Star Wars 25th Anniversary logo, turn this from just a toy into a proper display piece that looks intentional on your desk or bookshelf.
It works equally well for kids aged 10 and upwards who want to play out Star Wars scenarios and adult collectors who just want a detailed replica sitting next to their other memorabilia. The articulation points and removable accessories encourage actual play rather than static display, but the model is sturdy enough to survive either use case without falling apart.
At $79 instead of the usual $99, you’re saving $20 on one of the few discounted Star Wars LEGO sets available this Black Friday which makes this deal worth jumping on before stock runs out or the price creeps back up.

Most outdoor security cameras are constantly draining batteries, require ongoing subscription fees for cloud storage or need complicated wiring/constant recharging that makes maintenance a headache. The eufy security SoloCam S220 eliminates these headaches through solar charging that keeps the battery perpetually topped up with just three hours of daily sunlightÂ while local storage removes monthly fees entirely.
At $49, down from $99, this wireless camera has hit a record-low price on Amazon for Black Friday. The 50% discount makes buying individual units more economic than the multi-camera packs also on sale, which is strange since bulk bundles usually offer better per-unit pricing.

Most climates keep the battery charged indefinitely with an integrated solar panel, requiring only three hours of daily sunlight for continuous operation. This threshold is achievable even on overcast winter months in northern latitudes, although it’s obvious that southern, sunny climates easily exceed the requirements. For this reason, the solar capability makes this an install-and-forget solution that runs perpetually without intervention rather than a truly battery-powered camera that requires quarterly recharges.
You avoid the frustrating cycle of climbing ladders every few months to remove, recharge, and reinstall cameras that plague purely battery-dependent competitors. The environmental benefit of solar operation extends beyond mere convenience by eliminating disposable batteries and reducing overall energy consumption compared to wired cameras drawing constant wall power.
The 2K resolution captures significantly more detail than standard 1080p camerasÂ and allows for digital zoom into footage without losing clarity when reviewing suspicious activity or identifying faces and license plates. In daylight, the sensor resolves fine details of clothing patterns, vehicle makes, and facial features from reasonable distances. The f/1.6 aperture lets substantially more light reach the sensor than cameras with smaller apertures, such as f/2.0 and f/2.4, which directly improves low-light performance before infrared illumination even activates. Once darkness falls, infrared LEDs invisibly illuminate the scene to provide night vision that maintains clarity and detail, rather than the grainy, indistinct footage that renders cheaper cameras nearly useless after sundown.
Human detection powered by AI on the device filters out false alerts from swaying branches, passing cars, or wandering animals that constantly trigger motion-based systems. The intelligence identifies actual people and sends alerts specifically when humans enter your monitored area, which reduces notification fatigue from dozens of meaningless alerts each day. Local processing happens completely on the camera itself without ever sending footage to cloud servers, protecting your privacy while facilitating faster response times since data doesn’t have to travel to remote servers for analysis.
The process of wireless installation takes minutes where you drill one hole for the mounting bracket and essentially you are done. No running of ethernet cables through walls, no complicated electrical jobs, no coordination with electricians or handymen charging hourly rates. The compact size and wire-free design allow placement in optimal surveillance positions without concern for nearby outlets or limitations on cable routing. You can mount cameras under eaves, on fence posts, or attached to trees if needed, positioning for coverage rather than compromising based on wiring constraints.
In contrast, it is a no-monthly-fee model that genuinely gives long-term savings compared to subscription-based competitors like Ring or Nest, at $3 to $10 monthly per camera. Over five years, these subscriptions add up to $180 to $600 per camera just to unlock basic features like video storage and AI detection. The Eufy approach focuses on storing footage locally on the internal memory of the cameras and handling AI alerts on-device, thus removing any recurring costs while retaining full functionality.
The eufy security SoloCam S220 brings solar-powered operation and 2K resolution at a new record low for Black Friday.

12,2025-11-25,"Apple is just a few percentage points away from overtaking Nvidia as the world’s most valuable company, thanks in part to Google. Whether that will hold is another story. Here’s what’s happening.
Since early 2023, Nvidia’s stock has skyrocketed more than 1,000%, thanks mainly to its unique position as the AI market’s leading hardware provider.
This allowed Nvidia to close in on Apple and Microsoft early last year, and definitively overtake them over the first half of 2025.
However, thanks to some shifts in the market over the last few days, Apple may be about to reclaim the title of the world’s most valuable company.
Interestingly, the reason for this is twofold (and somewhat contradictory).
For one, the market appears to be looking for more convincing evidence that the feared AI bubble is not about to burst.
Things looked momentarily under control after Nvidia reported a stellar financial quarter last week, with its stock gaining multiple percentage points in extended trading, only to start dropping the next day alongside the bulk of the technology sector.
Second, and this is where the contradiction comes in, Nvidia saw a 5% drop earlier today, following a The Information report claiming that Meta may be about to strike a multi-billion-dollar deal with Google over the supply of AI chips.
This added to the mounting pressure over accusations that the countless circular deals that have overtaken the entire AI sector have caused Nvidia to allegedly inflate its revenues, a claim the company categorically denied, dismissing comparisons with the Enron financial scandal.
Apple, for its part, has seen a steady climb in its stock over the past few months, and closed at a $4.124T market cap today, behind Nvidia’s $4.234T valuation.
The irony here is that while Apple has been widely criticized for being a latecomer in the AI field, this also means that the company is likely to be less exposed if, or when, the AI bubble bursts.
If the current market trends hold (and that’s a big if), Apple and Nvidia are likely to trade places as the world’s most valuable company in the coming days and weeks.
As to whether Apple will actually firmly overtake Nvidia as the world’s most valuable company, whether by its own merits or by a continued erosion of Nvidia’s market value, time will tell.

Google is on a tear right now — but its success in the AI race wasn't always guaranteed.
In late 2022, OpenAI captured the moment with the release of ChatGPT. After a number of fumbles as Google struggled to get its own chatbot out the door, some of the closest Google watchers were calling for CEO Sundar Pichai to step down.
Nearly three years later, Google has performed a miraculous turnaround. Its new AI model, Gemini 3, is proving such a win that Marc Benioff said he's switching from ChatGPT. Google has just surpassed Microsoft's market cap and is on its way to a $4 trillion status. Its stock price is up nearly 70% this year.
It's a signal that Google — which has always held the various pieces to compete — has finally got everything working in harmony, all the way from the models up to the platforms like Search that put them in users' hands.
In the fast-moving AI race, no victory is secure — but Google has never looked stronger. Here's why.
Gemini 3 rolled out to the public last week with rave reviews. It outperforms its predecessor in coding, design, and analysis, and surpasses competing models in benchmark tests. As we at Business Insider discovered, it's highly adept at designing websites and basic video games, giving it broader use beyond coding.
The new model has allayed some fears that Google was too far behind rivals and that scaling laws — rules that say AI models improve with more data and compute — were slowing down. The company's stock price has increased by more than 12% since the rollout of Gemini 3 on November 18.
Google has spent over a decade developing its own chips for internal use. Known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), Google has used these chips to train its Gemini models. That's a great advertisement as Google hopes more companies will adopt the chips for their own models.
Google sells access to its TPUs through its cloud business and has made a significant internal push in recent months to attract more customers. That could pose a long-term threat to Nvidia's business. Google is currently in discussions for a blockbuster deal with Meta worth billions of dollars, which would potentially host some of Google's chips in one of Meta's own data centers, according to a person familiar with the discussions. The Information first reported on the arrangement, which sent the shares of chip companies like AMD and Nvidia tumbling on Tuesday.
In September, a federal judge handed down penalties for an antitrust lawsuit brought against Google's search business in 2020. Those penalties, which threatened to tear up Google's lucrative search empire, amounted to little more than a slap on the wrist. Google was told it could continue making payments to partners such as Apple for default status, but could not do so exclusively. It was also ordered to share some search data with rivals.
At one point, Google's Chrome browser was on the chopping block, which could have severed a crucial part of Google's search-advertising flywheel. Despite the judge ruling that Google had acted as a monopoly, the company came away relatively unscathed.
Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway built a $4.3 billion stake in Google parent company Alphabet last quarter, a regulatory filing revealed. That's notable for two reasons. Other than Apple, Buffett has tended to avoid tech stocks. He has also historically avoided expensive, high-growth companies.
As Buffett prepares to step back as CEO, the decision to finally bet on Google — something he said he wished he'd done long ago — suggests strong confidence in the search giant.
Google's core moneymaker is still search advertising, and one of the big investor fears has been how Google's self-disruption might hurt its cash cow. Not a lot, apparently: Search revenues jumped 15% in the third quarter, suggesting that even if AI is hurting some websites' traffic, it's not harming Google's business.
In fact, Google says generative AI is causing people to search more than ever. The company is currently testing ads in AI Mode, its chatbot-like version of search that is gradually feeling like less of an experiment and more like Google's vision for how search will eventually work.

Four years ago, Pinterest was bleeding users.
The platform known for mood boards had made a big effort to compete with TikTok — as did nearly every other social media platform at the time — with short-form video, shoppable livestreaming, and paying creators.
It didn't work. When Bill Ready took over as Pinterest's CEO in 2022, he felt the company needed a new direction.
""I didn't think the world needed a fourth or fifth best TikTok,"" Ready told Business Insider in an interview. Ready, who left his previous post as Google's president of commerce, decided that a search experience that was both personalized to each user and highly visual would be the platform's special sauce.
This story is part of a series exploring the changing online search landscape and its impact on consumers, media companies, advertisers, and tech platforms.
""Search is the core of the business,"" Ready said. ""The business didn't have that clarity three years ago.""
Pinterest's user growth has rebounded since Ready's takeover, steadily increasing for the past nine quarters. It recently hit 600 million monthly active users, and about two-thirds of the interactions on the platform are related to search.
Pinterest's focus on search has been a hit with users, with about 80 billion monthly search queries, according to the company.
It's also helped Pinterest win over Gen Z users.
More than half the platform's users are now Gen Z, Ready said. In a 2025 survey conducted by Adobe of 800 consumers and 200 business owners, 47% of Gen Z respondents said they used Pinterest for search.
""At the core of why we're winning with Gen Z is what we're doing with visual search and what we're doing to make it more positive than social media,"" Ready said.
Pinterest has more to prove. The company's share price hasn't returned to its pandemic high. While Pinterest's revenue increased 17% year-over-year in the third quarter, its stock plummeted over 20% following its earnings release, which included an earnings miss and weak guidance for the fourth quarter. Pinterest management said ad sales had been negatively affected by tariffs.
Raymond James analyst Josh Beck rated the company at a neutral ""market perform"" following the third-quarter earnings, but wrote he was ""encouraged"" by Pinterest's broader progress in shopping and ""untapped"" advertising opportunity.
Search will continue to play a significant role in Pinterest's advertising strategy, as Ready emphasized in its latest earnings that Pinterest search results are ""highly commercial in nature.""
Broadly, search has been undergoing a shake-up due to new consumer behaviors, such as using TikTok or ChatGPT to find answers. Advancements in technology, including visual search, are shifting how people — especially younger generations — search, said EMARKETER analyst Sky Canaves. (EMARKETER is a sister company to Business Insider.)
""Whatever is the easiest way to find information and has the least amount of friction will be most likely to be used for the particular search cases, whether it's voice, or text, or images,"" Canaves said.
Pinterest has rolled out a series of revamped search tools under Ready's watch, including an AI-powered tool that enables users to discover content tailored to their body type, skin tone, and hair pattern.
In May, the platform expanded its ""visual search"" features, allowing users to find exact products or similar items. It's a category that competitors like Google, TikTok, and new startups are also targeting.
Here's how it works: Imagine you're redecorating your apartment and save an image for inspiration to your Pinterest board. With visual search, you can shop right from that image — clicking on a lamp, for example, will surface links to similar items and sometimes an exact match.
With stronger search tools — and the data that comes with them — Pinterest has opened up more doors for advertisers and in-app shopping.
Lower-funnel ads, meaning ads that drive the user to make a purchase, make up two-thirds of Pinterest's business, Ready said.
""Search behaviors are key inputs powering its ads business,"" Forrester analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf told Business Insider. ""That intel makes Pinterest a really attractive high-intent surface for advertisers.""
AI is also playing a significant role in how users shop via Pinterest by learning their tastes.
""Effectively, what we've created is an AI-powered shopping assistant,"" Ready said. In October, Pinterest officially launched a shopping assistant tool that users can chat with verbally or over text.
Users who visit Pinterest to search, whether for shopping or inspiration, are ""more valuable"" than pass-by scrollers, said Kamran Ansari, Pinterest's former head of corporate development.
""The whole reason why Google built a $3 trillion company is search has the highest kind of intent signal of anything you can possibly do,"" Ansari said.
Ready, who worked at Google for a little over two years before joining Pinterest, is well acquainted with the stakes in search.
Google still owns about 90% of the market share for traditional search, according to data from Cloudflare. 
In a March EMARKETER survey, 93% of US consumers said they had used Google in the last year. There were also many players cited in the EMARKETER survey that fall outside the traditional search market, from e-commerce platforms like Amazon (56%) and Walmart (45%) to video platforms like YouTube (49%) and TikTok (29%).
""The future of search is more up for grabs than it has been in the last 25 years,"" Ready said.
According to a recent McKinsey survey of US consumers, about 50% said they ""intentionally seek out AI-powered search engines, with a majority of users saying it's the top digital source they use to make buying decisions.""
As players like ChatGPT and Perplexity aim to battle Google for the wider, all-purpose search market, Pinterest is focused on improving its visually driven niche, Ready said.

If you look at Black Friday and Cyber Week as a war fought between retailers â and there are worse analogies â one of the prime battlegrounds is tablets, with Apple, Google, Amazon, Samsung, and a host of others slugging it out. The good news is, as the tech giants all fight each other’s prices lower and lower, we all win. Here’s one of those winning deals â the Google Pixel Tablet is on sale at Amazon for 38% off in a Black Friday deal, bringing this top-level Android tablet down to just $249.
This is the 11-inch model Pixel with 128GB of storage â the 256GB version is only 16% off thus far, so the smaller one is the superior deal â and it earns high marks across the board for streaming, surfing, video calls and conferencing, emailing, and more. If you have Google Smart Home devices or you’re considering taking that leap, however, the Pixel tablet really shines as a smart-home hub to control them all.
See at Amazon
As extensive and easy the connection between the iPad and the wider Apple universe is, the Pixel’s interaction with the massive Google ecosystem might just have it beat. Gmail, Google Drive, Google Meet, YouTube, and the rest of Google’s huge array of apps are all immediately and easily accessed with the Pixel Tablet. Seamless and virtually unlimited storage in Google Cloud Storage makes the Pixel’s smaller 128GB of built-in storage a moot point. Google’s physical products, including the Pixel Buds and smartphones, also make for easy linkups with the Pixel tablet â you can even copy and paste messages and photos from a Pixel phone to a Pixel tablet.
The newest members of the Google family are also prime selling points for the Pixel tablet â Gemini and Google AI. These artificial intelligence tools are outstanding on any device, with Gemini’s creative brilliance helping you write emails, brainstorm, summarize notes or Gmails, and more, and Google AI’s amazing ability to search anything from whatever app you’re using when you draw a circle around it.
Even if the Pixel was not a prominent member of the huge Google ecosystem, it would be an outstanding tablet on its own. The 11-inch display has 2560×1600 resolution and an anti-smudge coating, so its great for streaming, gaming, or videocalling. Three microphones and four speakers add to the interaction potential, along with the 8MP front camera with automatic lighting adjustments and the ability to keep you in the frame even as you move around the room. The robust 12-hour battery life counts even when you’re streaming or making video calls, and the split-screen tech lets you drag and drop apps for side-by-side multitasking.
The Google Pixel Tablet stakes a claim to being one of the very best Android tablets on the market, and the 4.5-star average rating from Amazon reviewers bears that out. With Black Friday pricing at Amazon bringing the Pixel Tablet down by 38% to just $249, it’s one of the better tablet deals we’ve seen thus far.

They're bragging that you can switch between AI models freely when you're using their hardware. The model is replaceable and therefore fungible because of the hardware capabilities that they provide.
Depending on how much the industry and investors want to chase a flavor-of-the-month, that capability could be very appealing.
My employer doesn't operate in this space, so I don't know if that's a major selling point. But it never hurts to tout every advantage.
It's pretty important if you're working in a developing field. The original TPU couldn't do floating point so it wasn't really useful for training. IIRC they also work best with matrices that have dimensions that are multiples of fairly big numbers (128? 256?) with later generations working best with bigger matrices.
That's great for the current focus on gigantic attention matrices but not so great if the next big thing can't be efficiently shoehorned into that paradigm.
FPGA, anyone?

Why doesn't Nvidia make more specific chips to compete with Google on such server farms? They have the cash.

Nvidia is indeed a generation ahead.  Which amounts to an approx. 1 year lead on R&D.  Meanwhile, NVIDIA can't actually manufacture the chips they sell, and would have no ability to do so in less than 10 years.  At any time they want, TSMC can capitalize on the AI Bubble by switching to their own Chinese chip design and stop or slow production for Nvidia/AMD.   That's going to be a *big* adjustment for the S&P 500.

NVIDIA, seen as the dominant player in AI, has largely ignored development when it comes to actual graphics rendering for the past 1.5-2 years.   RTX 5000 isn't significantly faster than the RTX 4000 generation outside of....AI performance improvements.   The fact that NVIDIA put almost all of its eggs in that one basket makes NVIDIA ripe for a correction when the AI bubble pops.
AMD is recognized in the AI area, and while not the dominant player, AMD hardware is still good, and the software stack has been improving over time.   AMD hasn't ignored graphics(RDNA 4 was a very solid design based on the Radeon 9070XT performance considering it's mid-level design), FPGA, and of course, CPUs for consumer/business/servers.   As a result, even if AI goes down, AMD isn't in danger, and will still continue to do well.   NVIDIA LIED in saying that AI eliminates the need for a CPU, people still need a CPU in their computer, and in their servers, and professional workstations.
Intel is a mess, CPU division isn't doing all that well, graphics are weak, AI isn't anywhere, so if anything, Intel should sink just because it has no products that seem to be impressive.
Remember when the housing bubble popped, but prices are higher than ever again?
Are houses as easily produced and sold as video cards?

A TPU isn't a drop-in replacement for an Nvidia GPU or CUDA workload.
Google can build it's own Gemini models to use the TPU, and then any Gemini use will be on TPU, but if GCP is serving some other model then they also need to provide whatever that model is coded for, most likely CUDA/Nvidia.
So, the percentage of GCP AI load running on TPU is whatever precentage is using Gemini, or another Google model, as opposed to something else.

HP on Tuesday said it will cut between 4,000 and 6,000 jobs by the end of 2028 as it goes all-in on AI.
The PC and printer company announced the cuts in its earnings report, estimating it will save approximately $1 billion by 2028 as it implements the changes. The company estimates it will incur roughly $650 million in costs related to the restructuring, with about $250 million of the expense falling in fiscal 2026.
HP's strategy is to ""drive customer satisfaction, product innovation, and productivity through artificial intelligence adoption and enablement,"" and achieve cost savings through ""workforce reductions, platform simplification, programs consolidation, and productivity measures,"" according to its earnings presentation.
""Two years ago, we started to do some pilots on how AI could help us to drive these things,"" HP CEO Enrique Lores said during the earnings call. ""What we have learned is that we need to start from redesigning the process, and once we know how the process could be redone using AI, using agenetic AI, it can really have a very significant impact.""
He added later in the call that the company ""finished 2025 strong, growing profit from the first half to the second.""
""In 2026, we intend to grow faster than the market,"" he added. ""We have a significant opportunity to embed AI in everything we do and transform the company.""
The company beat revenue expectations in Q4. However, Bloomberg analysts forecast that the company would post an EPS of $3.32 in 2026, while HP estimated its non-GAAP diluted net EPS to be in the range of $2.90 to $3.20, which is below analysts' expectations.
HP's stock was down more than 5% in after-hours trading at the time of publication, and is down more than 25% year-to-date.
Business Insider previously reported that the era of AI-driven layoffs is hitting white-collar industries particularly hard, with companies such as Amazon and Workday announcing significant job cuts related to advancements in artificial intelligence.

Dick's Sporting Goods is getting an early start on spring cleaning.
The retailer said Tuesday it intends to close an unspecified number of Foot Locker locations after completing its acquisition of the company in September.
""Our first priority is clear. We need to clean out the garage of underperforming assets,"" executive chairman Ed Stack told investors during Dick's third-quarter earnings call. ""This means clearing out unproductive inventory, closing underperforming stores, and rightsizing assets that don't align with our go-forward vision for the Foot Locker business.""
Stack said that while the business shows significant promise, Foot Locker's prior leadership did not respond appropriately to market changes, including Nike's decision to shift a greater portion of its business to direct-to-consumer sales. The sportswear giant has since changed that approach, however, and is working to rebuild its relationships with retailers, including Dick's and Foot Locker.
Foot Locker ended the quarter with nearly 2,600 stores globally across several brands. The company closed 15 locations during the period.
Roughly 1,600 Foot Locker stores are in North America, and the company said Tuesday that former Nike executive Ann Freeman would head up the North American division. Former Aldi CEO Matthew Barnes is in charge of the international segment.
Stack also said the company has started an 11-store test to explore changes to Foot Locker's product assortment and in-store experience.
The company plans to share more details about which stores it plans to close in its fourth-quarter earnings report, Stack said.

22,2025-11-25,"If you're anything like me, then you're only using a tiny fraction of what you can access with your Microsoft 365 subscription. Up until now, I've pretty much just been creating Word documents and managing my Outlook emails. It turns out there's a wealth of applications and features waiting to be discovered.
A Microsoft 365 subscription gets you access to a bunch of tools, applications, cloud services, and security features that you might not even know you've got. Whether you'll be able to use everything on the list will depend on what kind of plan you have. We've not included anything that only works with a Business or Enterprise subscription, so everything should work with a Personal plan. However, if you're using a Family plan, some features are only available to the primary account holder. Student and educational plans might also be more limited, depending on how they've been set up.
Whether you actually need to start using the features below will depend heavily on what you want to accomplish. But in most cases here, even if you don't have a use for them straightaway, they're fun to play with, and it's helpful to know that they're there. So that next time you need to remove the background from an image or add the name of the Madagascan national anthem to an Excel spreadsheet, you'll know that's one of the features that you're already paying for.
Copilot, Microsoft's generative AI, isn't exactly hidden. The company is doing its utmost to promote it right now. You can access the Copilot chatbot without Microsoft 365, and this may be all you need if you just want to ask a few questions of an artificially intelligent large language model. Microsoft 365 subscriptions take things further by integrating Copilot into multiple other applications. So AI can generate drafts, rewrite text, or summarize documents in Word. It can analyze data, create charts, and generate formulas in Excel. Or draft emails, summarize long threads, and suggest replies in Outlook. In PowerPoint, you can basically hand over the creation of an entire presentation to AI now. Simply type ""Strategies to maximize profits and optimize our core competencies"" and let Copilot do the work. Some actions use AI credits. You can see your remaining credit balance on your Microsoft account page. These refresh every month. 
Integrated Copilot features range from useful to irritating. I consider myself more pro-AI than many people, and yet I found much of it intrusive. We'll cover Copilot more in the following sections because, really, AI is everywhere in Microsoft applications now. If you want to turn off Copilot functionality, you can do so by clicking File in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, and selecting Options. Go to the Copilot tab and uncheck the Enable Copilot box. In Outlook, the off switch is in settings. However, you won't save any money on your Microsoft 365 subscription if you opt out of using AI.
If you have Microsoft 365, you get up to 1TB of cloud storage on OneDrive rather than the paltry 5GB with a free plan. This may be one of the reasons you're paying for a subscription in the first place. OneDrive also has other features, like the option to restore files to previous versions by accessing the file's version history and the Personal Vault feature. This is a protected area within your OneDrive storage that offers an extra layer of security using authentication methods like fingerprints, face recognition, or PINs. You can still use the Personal Vault with a free account, but storage is limited to three files. Your 365 subscription means you can lock as many files in your vault as you like.
OneDrive also has Copilot features because everything does these days. If you open OneDrive and select a file, you can click the Copilot button and ask it questions related to that document. It can summarize documents, write FAQs, or answer other kinds of information like ""What's the most expensive item on this invoice?"" You can select multiple documents in a folder, and it works with Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and even PDFs. Its answers don't appear to be confined to the document you've highlighted, though. I asked it what the capital of Belgium was, and it provided the answer even though the selected document had absolutely nothing to do with Brussels. This is useful because you might want to ask Copilot how to expand a document or have it fact-check something. But sometimes you'll need to make it clear if you only want it to use the information in your file rather than the entire internet.
Clipchamp is Microsoft's video editor application. I had never heard of it before, even though it was already installed on my laptop. If you don't have it already installed, you can download it, or you can use a cloud-based version via your browser. There's a free version, but with a 365 subscription, you get more features, like high-definition 4K video exports, a bigger library of stock videos and audio, and more filter options. If you're someone who frequently makes videos, you might find this a usable, already-paid-for alternative to other tools. If, like me, you've never actually created a video in your life, you'll find it pretty straightforward to get the hang of it. It's mostly just dragging and dropping things where you want them. I was relieved to discover that you can make a test video using stock footage, music, and text-to-voice voiceover, so you don't have to record yourself at all.
You can layer images, background music, audio, and text. Clicking on a layer brings up options on the right-hand side of the screen. So, for example, for an audio layer, you can adjust the volume and speed, and set it to fade in or out. You can also toggle on Noise Suppression to remove background sounds. Pictures, videos, and audio files can be imported directly, and there's also an extensive content library. It's royalty-free for both commercial and non-commercial use, so you can use it to make social media content or put together corporate videos. As it's a Microsoft product, it integrates with OneDrive, so if you create videos or audio, they are automatically backed up. Seasoned pros might find it a bit lacking compared to, say, Adobe Premiere, but if you're looking for something to make TikTok or Instagram videos, this might be all you need.
Excel Data Types is a nifty function that you might not know is available. If you've got an Excel spreadsheet that needs up-to-the-minute (ish) data about stock market prices, currency exchange rates, or even a country's carbon emissions, then you can add it with just a couple of clicks. To use it, open an Excel spreadsheet, then enter a company name, currency code, or the name of a country, state, or city in a cell. Then, go to Data on the top toolbar and in the Data Types section, select Stocks, Currencies, or Geography. If there's more than one option, you can select the one you want. The cell will then display a small icon in the top left – a map for geography, or a stock market building for stocks and currency.
Go to the cell and select the ""Insert Data"" icon. (a table with a green plus sign). Here, you can choose either ""Show Data Type Card"" or select a field to insert. ""Show Data Type Card"" brings up a window containing information about your location, stock, or currency. It's for reference only, and doesn't populate the spreadsheet. If you want to add new information cells, you can do so using the ""field"" list.
Available options depend on the data. For example, for New York City, the list includes State, Latitude, Longitude, Population, Time Zone, and Image. For the U.S.A., you'll see options including official language, carbon dioxide emissions, and national anthem. Data is dynamic, so if you select Price for a stock, it'll be updated in your spreadsheet, though not as frequently as it's updated on the stock exchange, obviously. Information for non-U.S. exchanges is delayed, so stock prices will be about 15-30 minutes old, depending on the exchange providing the data.
Microsoft Forms is an online survey creator, included with a Microsoft 365 subscription. I found it easy and intuitive to use. You just select whether you would like to create a quiz, form, invitation, or something else, and follow the template. You can select the type of format you want for the responses, like multiple choice or a text box, and there's the option to add ""Other"", which automatically creates a mandatory text box. Using the branching functionality means you can make some questions conditional on responses to previous ones. There are also options to add colors, images, and even videos to your form, along with some royalty-free generic music, if you really want to be unkind to whoever's completing your survey. (Thankfully, they do have the option to switch this off.)
As it's a Microsoft 365 tool, Forms integrates with other Microsoft applications, so you can, for example, import a list of quiz questions from a Word document. I found this only worked when I used numbered lists; Otherwise, it just dumped my whole quiz into one question. You can also integrate Forms into PowerPoint if you want to incorporate a quiz or survey questions into a presentation. The live feature means you can get responses from your audience in real-time using a QR code. And if you're wondering just how wild you can go with your form creation, you can create up to 400 surveys and quizzes before you'll need to start deleting some. Each one can have up to 200 questions, and each can receive up to 5 million responses.
At first glance, Microsoft Designer looks similar to other design tools, like Canva. I pay for the Pro version of Canva, and I was excited about the possibility of saving $15 a month by switching to design software I already pay for. However, after using it, I now think that Designer isn't so much a design tool as an AI image generator with a few resizing and text features. If you want to create something purely using AI, Designer makes it easy. Simply select ""Create with AI"" and describe what you want, in much the same way as other AI image-generating tools. The ""Edit with AI"" option is also easy to use. You upload a picture, and then select from the many editing options. You can do things like remove or blur backgrounds, add filters, erase part of the picture, or cover your image with AI-generated stickers.
Using the ""Start From Scratch"" option, however, is a challenge. I wanted to begin with a blank canvas and work from there, and it really didn't make it easy. Options for uploading pictures are limited — or at least extremely well hidden. The only way I could find to upload multiple photos was via the AI options, by getting Copilot to create a collage and then editing its results. It also feels a bit buggy. If you select an A4 canvas, it creates a square one, and it opens up previous designs when you've selected a new project. I kept running up against an error message saying ""Something's wrong on our end."" I'm sure if I kept using it, Designer's features would become more familiar.
Microsoft Access isn't really hidden. It's just that many people have forgotten about it and might be surprised to learn it's still around. I used it a lot in the late 1990s, and haven't given it any thought in decades, but it's still there. Microsoft includes it in the Office 365 suite and has no plans yet to ditch it. Access is worth checking out if you're the sort of person who loves spreadsheets but finds that they're getting out of hand and overly complicated. Access is a better option than Excel when your information stops being a simple list and starts turning into a small ecosystem. For example, if you organize community events, data can multiply quickly. You might have one list for members, one for events, another for who's bringing food, and perhaps another for equipment you lend out. Access enables you to keep those lists tidy and properly linked, so everything stays connected without manually updating three places at once.
The reports feature is particularly pleasing, as it lets you display relevant bits of information in a nice, easy-to-digest format. There are also validation tools and customizable queries worth playing with. Unlike some of the other applications on this list, I really enjoyed putting Access through its paces and rediscovering all the things it can do. This might just be nostalgia on my part — like looking at old 1990s websites, but Access doesn't seem to have changed much in the last 20 or so years. The fact that Microsoft hasn't yet integrated Copilot here might be a factor.
Microsoft Word doesn't need any introduction. However, there are some features here that many people don't know about, especially when it comes to accessibility. Focus mode is an example of how some of the best features can be the simplest. Click the Focus button at the bottom right of a Word document and, as if by magic, all the distracting toolbars and panels disappear. How useful you find this really depends on what kind of brain you have. I find it wonderfully freeing. Sadly, Focus mode doesn't get rid of Copilot, whose icon still hovers around offering to rewrite your work for you, like an annoying modern-day version of Clippy. The AI in Word can be pretty useful when it comes to accessibility features. You can have Word's AI read your document to you by clicking on Read Aloud on the Review toolbar. Or you can open AI dictation and transcription features by clicking the microphone icon on the Home toolbar.
Away from AI, there's the ""Provide feedback with sound"" option. It's hidden away, but you can find it by clicking File, selecting Options, and opening the Accessibility tab. This setting provides a brief audio cue for specific actions, such as pasting content or when Word corrects your spelling. The little blips are subtle, but they provide a nice bit of feedback. The sound when you delete a chunk of text is especially pleasing. This last one isn't an accessibility feature, but it's certainly hidden. Go to a Word document, type =rand() and then hit return. Boom! Windows instantly gives you 200ish words of placeholder text. You can also type =rand.old() or =lorem() for different results."

24,2025-11-25,"Poland's antitrust regulator is investigating whether Apple is restricting competition in the mobile ads market through its App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework, reports Reuters.
Introduced in April 2021 with the release of iOS 14.5 and iPadOS 14.5, Apple's ATT framework requires that all apps on ‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌ ask for the user's consent before tracking their activity across other apps. Apps that wish to track a user based on their device's unique advertising identifier can only do so if the user allows it when prompted.
Apple said the feature was designed to protect users and not to advantage the company. It has been unsurprisingly unpopular with advertisers and data brokers. 
Poland's anti-monopoly office, UOKiK, suspects that Apple's ATT framework could be favoring the company's own ads service by limiting the ability of third-party apps to collect user data for personalized ads.

""We suspect that the ATT policy may have misled users about the level of privacy protection while simultaneously increasing Apple’s competitive advantage over independent publishers,"" UOKiK President Tomasz Chrostny was quoted as saying in a statement. ""Such practices may constitute an abuse of dominant position.""
If the regulator finds its suspicions to be warranted, Apple could face a fine of up to 10% of its annual turnover in Poland.
In an emailed statement to Reuters, Apple said:

""It is no surprise that the data tracking industry continues to oppose our efforts to give users back control over their data, and now intense pressure could force us to withdraw this feature, to the detriment of European consumers.""
""We will work with the Polish competition authority to ensure Apple can continue to offer users this valuable privacy tool.""
Regulators in Germany, Italy, and Romania have opened similar probes to examine whether the privacy feature violates competition rules by impeding access to essential data for advertising while reinforcing Apple's own position in the digital ad market. 
In March, Apple was fined €150 million ($162 million) by France's Competition Authority over the framework's implementation.

25,2025-11-25,"When thinking of high-performance, luxury vehicles, BMW usually comes up on everyone's list. The German automaker has been in business since 1916, churning out over a century's worth of sought-after coupes, sedans, and sports models while building up to a healthy stock value of $88 per share. But that was in 2015. BMW's stock has been on a bit of a rollercoaster ride since then thanks to economic fluctuations, leadership changes, and recalls. Yes, recalls. Despite its reputation of quality and luxury, BMW is not immune to error. One such error cost the automaker big-time in 2024. A faulty brake system resulted in the company issuing multiple recalls that year, affecting a whopping 1.5 million+ vehicles worldwide.
Replacing the brake systems on every affected car free of charge, the recall ended up being so costly for BMW that sales projections for 2024 were lowered. Of course, this was also because many of the affected models were from the 2024 and 2025 lineups, which were pulled from the lineup before they could be sold. It also doesn't help that the automaker's stock took a hit. Naturally, a recall isn't what any shareholders or potential buyers want to hear (even if a BMW may not be the best investment, especially if you're retired and looking for a vehicle), though the whole point of them is to prevent accidents and subsequent further costs. Still, some recalls have costs auto companies far more, and, in some cases, have even caused companies to go bankrupt.
Auto recalls vary tremendously in how much they cost, depending on the amount of vehicles affected as well as how extensive the fix is and what parts are involved. Just under 80,000 vehicles were affected when BMW issued its initial brake recall in February 2024. However, the issue escalated as the year wore on, and the recall was extended that fall to include additional years and models. Exactly how much the whole fiasco wound up costing BMW is unknown. However, what is known is that 5,821 fewer cars were sold in Q3 of 2024 compared to the same quarter the previous year. That's millions of dollars in lost revenue. BMW stock prices plummeted from $110.32 in January 2024 to $74.16 by November 2024.
As a further blow, BMW also announced that, for 2025, it would be significantly reducing both its costs and its investments from peak 2024 levels. The company has also seen multiple other leadership changes in 2025 and issued yet another recall in September, this time affecting the engines of nearly 200,000 vehicles. Whether or not even more recalls will happen in the near future is anyone's guess — it's just one of the risks that must be accepted as a part of auto ownership (and as an auto investor, for that matter). But if you are wary of BMW now, the good news is that there are plenty of affordable BMW alternatives that are reliable."

President Donald Trump is checking his list of potential Federal Reserve chairs twice.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has been leading the search, said that Trump could name his nominee to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell by Christmas.
""I think there's a very good chance that the president will make an announcement before Christmas,"" Bessent told CNBC in late November. ""But it's his prerogative, whether it's before the Christmas holidays or in the new year. But I think things are moving along very well.""
No matter who Trump selects, Bessent said he wants a less prominent central bank.
""I think it's time for the Fed just to move back into the background, like, it used to do, calm things down and work for the American people,"" Bessent said.
Powell's term expires next May, but hasn't stopped the White House from aggressively searching for his replacement.
Here are the five finalists.
Before joining Trump's orbit, Kevin Hassett advised a succession of Republican presidential nominees on economic policy, including George W. Bush, John McCain, and Mitt Romney.
Just before Thanksgiving, Hassett briefly lost his lead among the contenders on leading prediction markets. After a Bloomberg News report said he was the frontrunner, Hassett shot back up into first on Kalshi and Polymarket. As of November 25th, he has a double-digit advantage on both platforms.
During Trump's first term, Hassett served as director of the president's Council of Economic Advisors. He returned to the White House during the COVID-19 pandemic and was severely criticized for publishing a model showing coronavirus deaths hitting zero by May 15, 2020.
In October 1999, Hassett cowrote with journalist Jason Glassman ""Dow 36,000: The New Strategy for Profiting From the Coming Rise in the Stock Market."" Some economists have heavily criticized the book, largely because the index took more than 22 years to reach that threshold.
Fed Gov. Christopher Waller told Fox News that he thought his most recent conversation with Bessent went well.
""I talked to Scott about 10 days ago. We had a nice, a great, meeting,"" Waller told Fox Business in late November.
Waller said that the White House is looking for someone with ""experience."" It's not clear what experience that entails, but of the reported finalists, only three have experience serving on the central bank.
""I think they are looking for someone who has merit, experience, and knows what they are doing in the job, and I think I fit that,"" he said.
Just before Thanksgiving, Waller briefly dethroned White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett as the favorite of leading prediction markets. Waller's lead was short-lived as Hassett quickly supplanted him.
Waller, a longtime regional Fed official, was seen as a convention pick when Trump nominated him to the central bank in 2019. Simultaneously, Trump also nominated Judy Shelton, a former campaign advisor and a Fed critic. The fight over Shelton's nomination soon spilled over onto Waller's.
In December 2020, the Senate confirmed Waller 48-47, the narrowest margin for any Fed governor since 1980, per The New York Times.
In July, Waller joined Gov. Michelle Bowman (another Trump first-term pick) in opposing the Fed's decision not to cut interest rates, the first dual dissent in more than 30 years.
Trump told reporters in September that Hassett, Waller, and Warsh were ""the top three"" to replace Powell.
Back in his first term, Trump reportedly considered Warsh to lead the Fed before he chose to nominate Powell in 2017.
Warsh spent his early years at Morgan Stanley, working as a specialist in mergers and acquisitions. President George W. Bush nominated him to the Fed in 2006 after Warsh served as an economic advisor in the Bush White House.
Drawing on his Wall Street ties, Warsh played a pivotal role in the central bank's response to the 2008 global financial crisis. When he left the Fed in 2011, the Times called him the Fed's chief liaison to Wall Street.
From the sidelines, Warsh has echoed Trump's criticism of Powell, calling for ""regime change"" at the Fed.
""The specter of the miss they made on inflation, it has stuck with them,"" Warsh told CNBC in July. ""So one of the reasons why the president, I think, is right to be pushing the Fed publicly is we need regime change in the conduct of policy.""
In 2018, Trump appointed Federal Reserve Gov. Michelle Bowman to the central bank.
After confirmation, she was reappointed in 2020. In June, she was narrowly confirmed as the vice chair of supervision.
Bowman started as an intern for Sen. Bob Dole. During the George W. Bush administration, she held posts at FEMA and the Homeland Security Department. She was vice president at Farmers and Drovers Bank in Kansas, her family's bank, before becoming the state's top banking official.
In September 2024, Bowman became the first Fed governor to vote against an interest rate decision since 2005. In July, she again voted against holding rates steady, though this time Waller joined her dissent.
There's also a big Wall Street name on Trump's shortlist.
Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, has spent decades on Wall Street, dating back to his time at Lehman Brothers.
Rieder is responsible for managing roughly $2.4 trillion in assets, per BlackRock. He's served as a member of the Fed's Investment Advisory Committee on Financial Markets.
Trump's shortlist at one point reportedly had almost a dozen names.
CNBC previously reported that the following are no longer under consideration: David Zervos, Managing Director and Chief Market Strategist at Jefferies; Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan; former St. Louis Fed President James ""Jim"" Bullard; Fed Gov. Philip Jefferson; and Marc Sumerlin, a former economic advisor to President George W. Bush.
Former Fed Gov. Larry Lindsey told CNBC that he withdrew from contention.

Nvidia brushed off concerns that Google is coming for its crown.
""NVIDIA is a generation ahead of the industry — it's the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done,"" the company said in a statement posted on X.
The chipmaker's comments followed a report that Meta is discussing plans with Google to potentially spend billions on the tech giant's chips to power Meta's data centers. Shares of Nvidia went tumbling after The Information report. As of early Tuesday afternoon, Nvidia was trading down over 3% on the day.
We’re delighted by Google’s success — they’ve made great advances in AI and we continue to supply to Google.NVIDIA is a generation ahead of the industry — it’s the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done.NVIDIA offers greater…
""We're delighted by Google's success — they've made great advances in AI and we continue to supply to Google,"" Nvidia said in the statement.
In response, Google said it was committed to supporting both chips.
""We are experiencing accelerating demand for both our custom TPUs and Nvidia GPUs; we are committed to supporting both, as we have for years,"" a Google spokesperson said in a statement.
Google continues to make strides in the AI race. The recent launch of Gemini 3 drew some positive reviews. Unlike many of its rivals, Google has a ""full-stack"" advantage, which enables it to control the entire process, from AI research to its cloud, which hosts its models.
In contrast, Nvidia has experienced a rocky couple of weeks. The world's largest company by market cap reported blockbuster earnings for the third quarter, which initially calmed market-wide fears of an AI bubble, only for those lingering doubts to creep back in.

Holiday shopping is on the rise, and if you haven’t grabbed a fun string of Christmas lights to brighten up your outdoor and indoor space, today is a good time to make the move.
Govee, a brand that offers some of our favorite smart lighting solutions out there, is now offering its outdoor-friendly, 164-foot Christmas Lights 2 for $130 on Amazon. That’s after a sweet, straightforward 35% discount on the retail price of $200, thanks to an early Black Friday deal.
These are already high in demand on regular days, and the current discount makes them an even more popular pick. It’s best to grab yours before the stock disappears for good, which could be any moment now.
See at Amazon
These aren’t your average, golden string lights. The string comes with 500 LEDs, each of which has a built-in IC chip to realize single control. Govee adds white LED beads to the color mix for a brighter setting with high color accuracy. There are 16 million color options to choose from (you read that right), meaning you can have a different one every single day of the year and still have plenty left to explore. Go with neon green in the morning, red in the evening, and wind down with a subtle golden at night; the possibilities are endless.
If plain, solid colors start to feel boring, especially during festivities, there are over 130 animated lighting effects for every possible occasion. For instance, the Thanksgiving option features warmer colors for cozy gatherings and hearty meals, while the Christmas one brings brighter colors to lift the energy of the whole house instantly. You can switch colors and patterns, plus create your own effects when feeling a bit creative. Not sure what to go for? Share your vision with the Govee AI Lighting Bot, and it’s going to create one based on your preferences. You can even upload some images to give it an idea of the vibe you’re hoping to achieve. Say something like “Give me a dancing Christmas effect”, and wait for the ultimate showdown.
As for the installation, setting the lights up is fairly straightforward. The 164-foot length is enough to line the roof, wrap around your Christmas tree, or frame the main door. It’s ideal for most homes, but if you need another size, these lights also come in 66ft, 99ft, and 328ft size options. The prices vary, but almost all the options are going for less right now. Once you have the lights up, you can manage them using the dedicated smartphone app or through your voice with Alexa and Google Assistant. You can ask the voice assistants to turn the lights on/off, change the patterns, adjust the brightness, and more, without even getting up from your couch.
Finally, Govee has designed the lights to be both waterproof and dustproof. They can handle extreme weather conditions (rain, harsh sunlight, snow) like a champ, so nothing is going to dim that spark, pun intended.
The current Black Friday deal brings the price down to just $130, which is quite affordable considering all the features you’re getting. Even though these are labelled as “Christmas lights”, you can use them all year round for every occasion, whether it’s birthdays, anniversaries, or even just casually at home. The brand is also offering plenty of its other top-rated lighting solutions for less, so now is a great time to stock up on both indoor and outdoor smart lights. Just be sure to act fast, as early deals tend to wrap up quickly.

It wasn’t long before wireless microphones became essential equipment for content creators tired of dealing with tangled cables and audio that sounds like you’re recording in a bathroom. The DJI Mic Mini earned its spot as the go-to choice among top creators for good reason, and the bundle with two transmitters is now entirely out of stock on Amazon, which says it all about how hot this system is.
But the good news, another DJI bundle with a single transmitter has fallen to $45 from its usual $89 price tag (49% off), hitting an all-time low that makes professional audio accessible without the usual sticker shock. This deal probably won’t last that long considering just how fast the dual pack disappeared and getting one now beats waiting for empty stock pages later.
See at Amazon
The DJI Mic Mini captures detail-rich audio with noise-canceling technology that removes background hum, wind noise, and the general chaos of recording in real-world environments instead of soundproof studios. You get automatic limiting that prevents distortion when your voice gets loud or excited, saving you from that clipping audio that ruins otherwise perfect takes.
The ultralight design weighs so little you forget you’re wearing it after the first few minutes, and that matters during long recording sessions when heavier mics start to feel like ankle weights around your collar. The 400-meter transmission range gives you freedom to move without staying tethered to your camera or phone, whether filming a house tour, doing street interviews, or just walking and talking through your latest vlog idea.
It works seamlessly with an iPhone, Android, or camera via plug-and-play connectivity that doesn’t take an engineering degree to set up. You clip the transmitter onto your shirt, plug the receiver into your device, and in mere seconds, you are recording clean audio instead of wrestling for twenty minutes trying to get a connection.
This compact receiver easily slides onto your camera’s hot shoe or directly connects to your phone, not adding bulk that makes your entire setup feel awkward and unbalanced. The battery life will easily last long enough for several shoots before needing to be recharged: you won’t have to constantly interrupt your creative flow, looking for a place to swap batteries or find power outlets.
Recording quality jumps noticeably compared to the built-in microphones on phones and cameras, and gives your videos that polished sound which actually makes viewers want to stick around rather than click away after ten seconds. The system automatically syncs audio to your video feed, and saves you the frustration of manually matching sound files in editing software later. Wind noise reduction works impressively well for outdoor recording, though extremely windy days still benefit from the included windscreen that blocks gusts without muffling your voice.
At $45 for this one-transmitter setup, you’re paying half the normal price for audio gear that immediately elevates your content above the tinny, echo-filled sound that screams “amateur hour” to anyone watching. Professional wireless systems from traditional audio brands cost three or four times this price, and they don’t necessarily sound better or work more reliably than the Mic Mini delivers.

Every day, this blog is automatically echoed on my Linkedin channel. Over the last few years, the traffic to those posts on Linkedin is down more than 90%. Understandable. Platforms evolve, people shift their patterns and interests.
I recently did a manual post on Linkedin, though, and was amazed to discover that within minutes, it had 10 times as much traffic as a typical post does. I did another one about this leap and it did even better. It’s clear that the algorithm was changed. 
Not to help me, not to help you, but to help the endless quest for more that most public companies wrestle with.
The seduction is clear. They’re sending a message: If you want us to bring you eyeballs, move in. Don’t link out.
Problem one: eyeballs don’t make change happen, people do.
Problem two: Don’t check into a motel that makes it hard to check out.
Enshittification is real. VCs and public markets push the companies they invest in to maximize profits. First, please the customers. Then, double cross them to please the advertisers. Finally, double cross both of them to please the stock price.
The alternative is to own your own stuff. To build an asset you control, and to guard your attention and trust carefully.
The best way to read blogs hasn’t changed in twenty years. RSS. It’s free and easy and it just works. It’s the most efficient way to get the information you’re looking for, and it’s under your control. There’s a quick explainer video at that link along with a reader that’s easy to use.
And, if you’re a creator of change, of brand, of content or of art, it’s worth considering whether you want to own the assets or just rent them.
As an experiment, this blog is now going to be shared via Zapier as a cut and paste to Linkedin. Perhaps that will help users who are trapped in their ecosystem be able to read it more easily. It’ll probably be stripped of links, which you can find here on the blog itself…
As always, the source of truth (and the latest posts with all typos fixed) is right here on the blog at seths dot blog.
Where we create our media and how we consume it are still up to us. It’s true, at some point, that the medium is the message.

Tesla may have gotten the balloons and streamers out a bit too early.
Launching its supervised full self-driving software, or FSD, across international borders has proved challenging for Tesla. While North American drivers have had access to FSD since 2022, the company has only released some features in China, its second-largest market.
Tesla owners in the EU appeared to be set to get some good news on that front, according to Tesla — but a Dutch regulator then chimed in to say not so fast.
On Saturday, Tesla posted on X that it had been pushing to roll out FSD in Europe for over a year. The ""main path to success,"" it said, was partnering with the Dutch approval authority RDW.
""Currently, RDW has committed to granting Netherlands National approval in February 2026,"" Tesla wrote in its X post.
Two days later, RDW shot back its own ""response to Tesla's appeal."" In the blog post originally written in Dutch, the regulatory agency had drawn up a schedule for Tesla to meet requirements by February 2026, but that the approval wasn't a done deal. Bloomberg was the first to report RDW's response.
""RDW and Tesla know what efforts need to be made to make a decision on this in February,"" the Dutch regulatory agency wrote, according to a Google translation. ""Whether the schedule will be met remains to be seen in the coming period.""
As the chokepoint for European FSD expansion, Tesla employees have been impatient with RDW's extensive testing and slowness. ""Keep in mind that this is mission critical for our leadership,"" a Tesla employee wrote in an email to the RDW last November, viewed by Business Insider. Musk has previously lamented the EU's self-driving regulation, calling it a ""layer cake of bureaucracy.""
Tesla has faced steep competition in the European market, as Chinese competitors like BYD race for market share. European Tesla sales were down an estimated 48.5% year over year in October, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association.
In Tesla's X post, the company also called on its fans to push the regulatory agency.
""Please contact them via link below to express your excitement & thank them for making this happen as soon as possible,"" Tesla wrote.
RDW didn't appear to be a fan of the move, asking readers ""not to contact us about this,"" according to the translation of its response.
""It takes up unnecessary time for our customer service,"" the translated post read. ""Moreover, this will have no influence on whether or not the planning is met.""

The OnePlus 15 hasn’t even settled into everyone’s hands yet, but OnePlus is already pushing its first major software update, and it's surprisingly huge.
The first software patch, labeled CPH2749_16.0.1.303(EX01), brings a long list of refinements that touch everything from performance and themes to network tools and fingerprint animations. For a first update, this one’s pretty loaded, coming in at 2.3GB.
OnePlus is positioning this release as a “new level of seamless experience,” and it's evident with improvements to app launch speeds from the Home screen. The update also leans heavily into personalization, with options to resize clocks when using certain Flux themes, rename widgets, and stack same-sized widgets by dropping them on top of each other.
The Photos app gets smarter, too. When cropping portraits, buildings, or anything with clear lines, the phone now offers automatic straightening so you don’t have to fiddle with sliders as much. And if you want a more expressive ringtone, you can finally set videos as system ringtones.
OnePlus is also touching up the lock screen. The fingerprint scanner animation gets a glow effect that looks cleaner and more modern. While it's not a game-changer, it's definitely more polished than the stock animation that shipped with the phone.
 



OnePlus 15's first update includes the November 2025 Android security patch, so you’re getting the latest vulnerability fixes alongside all the UI polish. Phone Manager also boosts its virus-scanning speed, which should help with regular background checks.
Network tools get one of the more interesting upgrades. OnePlus adds an interface for its AI LinkBoost Network Engine, giving you real-time insight into network optimizations, latency reductions, and more. If your signal suddenly dips or you’re in a spot with unstable connectivity, you’ll now get notifications when the phone kicks network acceleration into gear.

There’s also a built-in speed test that shows upload and download rates along with latency, so you can troubleshoot your connection without jumping to third-party apps.

35,2025-11-25,"Whether you're excited for the seasonal sales or avoiding the shops altogether, it's hard to escape the countless emails and social media adverts on Black Friday deals.
The shopping event which began in the US following the Thanksgiving festive holiday has been firmly adopted by UK retailers, and what was once a single day of sales now spans the weeks before and after.
However eight in 10 deals promoted during this buying bonanza were cheaper or the same price outside of the four-week Black Friday period, according to research from consumer group Which?
This suggests shoppers could get the same or a better deal at other times of the year. But if you're planning to buy now, here's how to make sure you bag a bargain.
Some retailers create the illusion of a big discount by raising prices in the weeks before Black Friday, only to drop them again during the ""sale"".
Websites such as PriceRunner or CamelCamelCamel let you look at previous prices so you can work out whether a discount is genuine.
For example, according to Price Runner, the cheapest Apple ipad overall was selling online for £309 on the 19 October. By 10 November it had increased to £391.99. When the Black Friday sales launched on 21 November, it was back down to £309.
This tactic isn't illegal, but it can easily mislead shoppers into thinking they're getting a far bigger discount than they really are, consumer champion, Rebecca Wilcox told Morning Live.
AI can help too, says retail analyst Natalie Berg, host of the Retail Disrupted podcast. ""You can ask ChatGPT: 'Show me the best Black Friday deals for a 10-year-old who loves the movie Wicked.' You don't need to trawl through different sites, which can be time-consuming and overwhelming.""
Shoppers often hold off buying items hoping they'll be cheaper on Black Friday.
But none of the 175 products tracked by Which? were at their cheapest price of the year on that day.
Retail analyst Catherine Shuttleworth says: ""There is a huge risk in [holding out], because the products you want to buy may not be available anymore.""
She says higher costs this year means retailers are less likely to have surplus stock.
So if you do find the product you're after and it's at a price you're happy with, Shuttleworth recommends buying it - and keeping your receipt. 
Many retailers will refund the difference if prices fall again. Some companies, like Currys and Argos, offer a Black Friday guarantee.
If you do find it cheaper within the returns period you could always take it back it and buy again at the lower price.
Don't just think about big-ticket items. Some of the biggest markdowns are on everyday items such as quilted toilet roll and dishwasher tablets, Kat Cereda from consumer watchdog Which? told the BBC.
Start by deciding what you actually need. If you're looking for a specific brand, check their website directly and join their mailing list for early access to their sales.
 ""The tech is there to help retailers offer more real-time rewards and target their best shoppers,"" says Berg.
Don't fall for pressure tactics such as ""selling fast"" or ""only two left"", which can fuel impulse buying, the competiton watchdog warns.
And if you're spending over £100, then it recommends using a credit card.
""You have legal protection that means you can claim for a refund if the company goes bust, your item doesn't arrive, or if there are certain other problems such as an item being faulty or not as described,"" says Hayley Fletcher from The Competition and Markets Authority.
Scammers ramp up activity around major events like Black Friday and can take advantage of the urgency shoppers may feel. Fake websites and counterfeit goods often spike during this period, posing as limited-time deals to lure people in.
""If something seems too good to be true or doesn't feel right, it might be a scam. Don't rush your purchase. Research the company you're buying from and be wary of suspicious web links,"" says Jane Parsons, consumer expert at Citizens Advice.
This year, TikTok shop has become an increasingly popular destination for Black Friday discounts, with brands such as M&S, L'Oréal and Rituals selling directly on the app. 
""You can find flash sales not available on a retailer's site,"" says Berg. ""But it's important to check the accounts you are buying from are verified.""
A woman from Newquay says ""insurmountable"" rises in costs mean she has had to close her restaurant.
Ahead of this week's Budget, some have accused the Office for Budget Responsibility of being a ""straitjacket on growth""
Town centres across the country are facing challenges with their high streets, so what's the answer?
There's growing concern that current tax and spending policies help pensioners, but are unfair on younger generations.
Coffees made with extra ingredients like mushrooms, protein and collagen are known as ""functional coffees"".

The market for home speakers is full of great options from Sonos, Bose and Samsung – all of them offering solid audio quality and smart features to merit their pricing. However, if you need a high-end speaker that doubles as a conversation piece through distinctive retro aesthetics inspired by classic guitar amplifiers, nobody pulls this vision off better than Marshall.
The iconic brand has successfully translated their legendary amplifier design language into Bluetooth speakers that look like miniature versions of the amps that powered rock history. At $179, down from $299, the Acton III has reached an all-time low price on Amazon for Black Friday and delivers on that signature Marshall sound that made them legends in professional audio.
See at Amazon
The third-generation design expands the stereo soundstage beyond earlier Acton models through revised driver placement and acoustic tuning that creates wider sound dispersion throughout your listening space. This engineering delivers immersive audio where instruments and vocals occupy distinct positions across the sound field rather than collapsing into a narrow center channel.
The Marshall signature sound emphasizes clarity across all frequencies while maintaining the punchy, dynamic character that made their amplifiers famous among musicians who demanded both power and precision. Rock, jazz, classical, and electronic music all benefit from the balanced frequency response that doesn’t sacrifice detail for overwhelming bass or harsh treble.
Futureproofing is in-built into the speaker with the next-generation Bluetooth 5.2 implementationÂ which supports emerging features and codecs the moment they become widely available instead of requiring hardware replacement to access new standards. This forward compatibility matters because Bluetooth audio technology continues evolving with improved codecs, lower latency protocols, and enhanced multi-device handling that will roll out over the useful life of this speaker.
Compared to older versions of Bluetooth, the improved connection stability reduces dropouts and interference from competing wireless signals in crowded home environments full of Wi-Fi routers, smart home devices, and neighboring networks. Traditional wired connection fallback via 3.5mm auxiliary input is available for devices without Bluetooth and for situations where you prefer avoiding wireless compression altogether.
It’s a pretty straightforward pairing process that eliminates complicated app requirements or multi-step configuration sequences which frustrate users who want to play music quickly: Press the Bluetooth button, select it from your phone’s Bluetooth menu, and you’re playing audio within seconds of taking it out of the box. This extends into daily use, where the speaker remembers previously paired devices and automatically reconnects when they come in range, rather than having to repeat the pairing every time you want to listen to something. The speaker has tactile, analog controls at the top that allow very satisfying physical interaction when adjusting the volume, bass, and treble-a feeling more engaging than simply tapping on glass touchscreens or issuing voice commands.
The Marshall Acton III brings re-engineered stereo soundstage at $179, a discount of 40% off retail this Black Friday. The competitive home speaker market offers many excellent audio options, but Marshall’s distinctive design and rock heritage create an emotional appeal that technical specifications just can’t provide.

The stereotypical millennial plight goes something like this: A guy or gal staring down 40 is trapped in a perpetual struggle to launch. They've finally moved out of their parents' homes, but later than their judgmental relatives expected. They're getting around to marriage and kids, but they're forever screwed on housing, still trying to shake the ghosts of the post-Great Recession job market, and drowning in student debt. They've developed a strange animosity toward their baby boomer parents, who seemingly had it all and won't let go.
Much of this stereotype, however, is more feeling than fact, especially when it's repeated by frustrated millennials themselves. Despite their gripes, the generation born between 1981 and 1996 is doing quite a bit better financially than their parents. It's just that they're not outpacing them as much as they expected, especially millennials on the wealthier end of the scale, who are accustomed to everything being extra great. That's a marked shift, since it was wealthier baby boomers who were the biggest winners of their generation. Poorer millennials are actually doing better than Americans at the lower end of the income scale in previous generations, but poor in America is still pretty bad, and for the rich, the narrowing of the income gap can be uncomfortable.
That's one of the takeaways from a recent paper out of the Federal Reserve Board comparing how Gen X and millennials are faring on their economic journeys. The findings: When Gen Xers and millennials hit their late 30s they had a median household real (aka inflation-adjusted) income 16% and 18% higher, respectively, compared to the generation before them at the same age, whereas the Silent Generation and baby boomers had increases of 34% and 27%, respectively.
""It's taking longer to launch, there is some more debt, but in the long run, millennials are actually doing better than Generation X and baby boomers,"" says Kevin Corinth, a senior fellow and deputy director of the Center for Opportunity and Social Mobility at the American Enterprise Institute and one of the paper's authors. ""It's just taking them a longer time.""
Nobody likes to hear, ""You'll be OK … eventually,"" or face the reality of life not working out quite as expected, and so it tracks that millennials would be vocal about the economy not being a bang-up time. The issue isn't necessarily struggling, it's recalibrating expectations.
Blame women for millennials not doing as well as their parents — or, rather, their moms. I'm kidding, but women in the workforce do explain much of what's going on. Many more baby boomer women launched careers compared to their mothers, which boosted household incomes and drove the outsize gains in generation-to-generation wellbeing. Chances are, if you're a millennial woman or Gen X, your mom had a job, so any gains you make are going to come from fighting for a raise.
""There wasn't more juice to squeeze to get additional income growth out of that, so now we're really relying on increased wages,"" Corinth says.
Wage growth can be a slow process, and thanks to the recovery from the Great Recession and pandemic-related labor market pressures, people at the bottom of the income distribution have seen bigger gains than people at the top. From January 2020 to June 2023, real hourly earnings for people in the 10th percentile of the wage distribution rose by 7.8%, while they fell by 6% and 8% for those in the 50th and 90th percentiles, according to a paper from researchers David Autor, Arindrajit Dube, and Annie McGrew, meaning wage gains were concentrated among lower-income workers while higher-income workers lost ground.
At the same time, millennials higher up the income distribution are feeling squeezed. Yes, the jobs market is always pretty good for higher-income, college-educated people — the unemployment rate for college-educated workers in the US is persistently well under 3% — but things for the typically comfortable are feeling a little uncomfortable right now. Many white-collar workers are having a hard time getting hired, and the headlines about mass layoffs at big companies are unnerving, as is the threat posed by AI. Even if you are doing fairly well, you may not love that people at lower incomes are catching up, while at the same time, the peak of the income scale doesn't feel any closer.
""The people who I call the lower-rich, they have never felt poor before. Now, they're not poor, either, but there is such a wide gap between what you earn as a young lawyer in a firm in New York compared to someone that works in private equity or that works at a hedge fund,"" says A. Mechele Dickerson, the author of the forthcoming book ""The Middle-Class New Deal Restoring Upward Mobility and the American Dream."" ""For the lower rich, they've never been in a space where the number that they are earning doesn't actually make them rich in their mind. It makes them poor.""
I do not want to dump on the plight of more well-off millennials, given that I am probably one of them. Obviously, everyone's personal situations are different, problems are problems, and the supposed American dream dictates that you're supposed to pull yourself up by your bootstraps, be upwardly mobile, and outdo your parents.
The country is in the midst of an affordability crisis that hits everyone. The housing market is a complete drag — the typical age of a first-time homebuyer is 40, which doesn't feel good as an age to have finally ""made it."" A college education still pays off, but many students are saddled with debt that makes it feel like it doesn't. Younger millennials who are doing well may not internalize it because they're still living off their parents' money.
The confluence of these elements ""really creates the condition for dissatisfaction for folks who thought they could have it all,"" says Rakeen Mabud, an associate fellow at Common Wealth, an economic think tank. ""People who have always had access to social mobility no longer having such easy access to social mobility does have implications for the general sort of malaise about the economy.""
This not only creates a sense of unease among millennials, but also triggers a lot of the generational animus millennials have toward boomers — though thinking your parents had it easier isn't particularly unique to the avocado toast cohort. ""Almost every generation is like this,"" says Matt Darling, a senior research associate at MEF Associates, a social policy research firm. People tend to downplay the tribulations that plagued previous generations — after all, they weren't around for them. Millennials frustrated by post-pandemic inflation could probably stand to talk to boomers about how they dealt with it in the 1970s and '80s. ""Every generation has its own unique challenges, and every generation forgets about what happened previously,"" Darling says.
As big-ticket items have become increasingly expensive — housing, healthcare, childcare, education — it's become easy to overlook the smaller-ticket items that have gotten cheaper. Yes, sending your kid to preschool is going to hit you where it hurts, but at least the toys you buy them and the clothes you put them in nowadays are super inexpensive. The same goes for that iPad you let them play with more than you should.
""As these items become a less big part of our spending, they also sort of drop out of our memory,"" Darling says. They're also all that's left of whatever the American dream is.
Consumers are wired to want more more more, and while baby boomers are often knocked as a hyper-materialist generation, millennials and Gen X are not exactly living light, stuff-wise. The thing is, getting more doesn't necessarily make you happier. The hedonic treadmill says that people generally revert to their normal level of happiness relatively quickly after they acquire the new fun thing. Finally closing on that house at 40 will feel good for a while, but eventually, it'll become the new norm, and you're suddenly itching for a place with one more bedroom.
Many millennials near the top (but not at the tip-top) feel a sense of precarity and scarcity. They feel the need to optimize their children's education and extracurriculars in order to ensure they get into the best schools. They're hyper-focused on their investments since their retirement depends on their own savings and 401(k)s, rather than a defined pension. They work extra-long hours in hopes that their boss might feel a twinge of guilt before putting them on the layoff list.
""They feel so vulnerable because they're looking at what the ultra-elite rich are doing and can afford to do, and, in comparison, they feel poor,"" Dickerson says.
They also don't feel very rich, comparatively, looking below them. As much as many wealthier people might not admit it, or even recognize it, wage compression — the shrinking of the pay gap up and down the income spectrum — can be discomforting for people at the top. If you spend a bunch of money on a college education and run into your cousin who just graduated from high school and realize they're making the same money as you, there's an understandable sense of, ""Wait, what was all that for?""
As workers at the bottom earn more, it can also push up prices for the better-off. Part of the reason people are annoyed by the high cost of their DoorDash orders is that delivery drivers may have a minimum amount they need to earn. That tip you're angry at at the coffee counter is supplementing the barista's pay, whose wages have gone up anyway in recent years and are making your fancy coffee pricier. Most people would agree it's good for home health aides to be paid more — until they try to hire one to take care of their parents. What's more, that aide's pay bump probably isn't bumping them into the middle class, so they're still struggling, even if it's to a comparatively lesser degree.
Despite some of the vibes (a word I hate to employ given how overused it's become), millennials are generally fine. Life's just moving a little slower, and fine often doesn't feel especially good.

39,2025-11-25,"According to a new report by Counterpoint Research, the success of the iPhone 17 line is expected to push Apple past Samsung as the world’s top phone maker. Here are the details.
Earlier this month, Counterpoint Research published two intelligence reports showing that Apple is outpacing the rest of the phone market, thanks in large part to the iPhone 17 line.
The first report showed that in the first month of iPhone 17 availability, Apple’s sales rose 22%, while the broader market slipped 2.7% over the same period.
In the second report, Counterpoint claimed that Apple posted a 37% year-over-year increase in iPhone sales in October, compared with an 8% bump for the market overall.
Now, a new Counterpoint intelligence report (via Bloomberg) says that while Samsung is expected to end 2025 with a 4.6% increase in phone sales, Apple is projected to register a 10% year-over-year growth.
This will be enough to push the company over the edge to reclaim the top spot as the world’s leading phone maker with a 19.4% market share.
Commenting on the numbers, Counterpoint analyst Yang Wang said:
“Beyond the highly positive market reception for the iPhone 17 series, the key driver behind the upgraded shipment outlook lies in the replacement cycle reaching its inflection point. (…) Consumers who purchased smartphones during the Covid-19 boom are now entering their upgrade phase. Furthermore, 358 million secondhand iPhones were sold between 2023 and Q2 2025. These users are also likely to upgrade to a new iPhone in the coming years.”
The report also says the broader smartphone market will grow a more modest 3.3%, and it predicts that Apple will remain the world’s top smartphone seller until at least 2029, helped in part by the reportedly upcoming foldable iPhone and the iPhone 17e.
The report comes on the heels of Apple’s own guidance that this holiday quarter will be the company’s biggest ever. During its last earnings call, CEO Tim Cook repeatedly highlighted the iPhone 17 lineup’s strong early performance, despite a broadly reported tepid response to the iPhone Air model, specifically.

41,2025-11-25,"We’ve all owned something where one tiny detail drives us nuts: a blinding power LED, buttons in the wrong order, or a beep that could wake the dead. This beautifully documented project fixes exactly that kind of annoyance, only this time it’s the climate-controlled seats in a 2020 Ram 1500.
[projectsinmotion] wasn’t satisfied with adjusting seat heating and ventilation only through the truck’s touchscreen. Instead, they added real physical buttons that feel just like factory equipment. The challenge? Modern vehicles control seats through the Body Control Module (BCM) over a mix of CAN and LIN buses. To pull this off, they used an ESP32-S3 board with both CAN and LIN transceivers that sits in the middle and translates button presses into the exact messages the BCM expects.
The ESP32 also listens to the CAN bus so the new physical buttons always match whatever setting was last chosen on the touchscreen, no mismatched states, no surprises. On the mechanical side, there are 3D-printed button bezels that snap into blank switch plates that come out looking completely stock, plus a tidy enclosure for the ESP32 board itself. Wiring is fully reversible: custom adapters plug straight into the factory harness. Every pinout, every connector, and every wire color is documented with WireVis diagrams we’ve covered before, making this an easily repeatable seat-hack should you have a similar vehicle. Big thanks to [Tim] for the tip! Be sure to check out some of our other car hacks turning a mass produced item into one of a kind.
Elegant.  I would have just hot wired them.  Maybe with a PWM controller if I was feeling generous.
I’m still annoyed that my car wanted to turn on the frickin’ air conditioner every time I want air coming from the windshield vents instead of the central vents (ok, they call them “defroster” vents).  Even if it’s 10 degrees out, the compressor comes on, blowing cold air unless I turn up the heat.  It’s uncomfortable and a waste of fuel, adding at least 10% to consumption.
I know, I know, they do it because the average moron driving a car who wants “defrost” would not think to turn on the A/C to dehumidify the air, so the manufacturer locks A/C on any time you select that vent as an outlet.  They had to add a switch to do that, and reduce the usability of the environmental controls, just to avoid average idiot customer complaints.
So I put put a great big toggle switch on the dash, and wired it in series with the A/C compressor electric clutch.  Unlabeled, natch.
Curious what kind of fuel mileage you get?
The last few cars I’ve had I found it difficult to spot the difference in consumption between AC on or off
On a 7000 km trip in August: 6.0 L/100km with AC off, 6.5-7.0 L/100 km with it on, depending on ambient temp.
That 0.5-1.0 L/hr consumption represents a mechanical power into the compressor of 1-2 kW, assuming a total fuel-to-compressor efficiency of 20%.  So about as much power as my 18 kBTU/hr (1.5 ton, 5 kWt) house unit.
It’s crazy it takes as much power to cool a car cabin as it does to cool a house fifty times the volume.
Most modern cars have variable displacement compressors. Old school compressors are bang bang on/off. This makes a big difference in efficiency.
Some even have completely electric compressors too.  Even gas cars.  Allows more flexible placement in the engine bay and is a bit more efficient.
You do realize that the A/C is supposed to come on with defrost right?  It’s used to lower humidity in the supplied air to help prevent continued moisture buildup while defrosting/defogging.
He mentions that in his comment.  Presumably there are times when de-humidification is not necessary, or he simply wants forced-air heating (not defrost specifically) that is not blowing directly on him.
For example if he was talking about 10F outside, then running the AC is pointless because it can’t safely get the dew point below 32F without icing the coils.
I have just the opposite complaint with my car (Kia EV6) – The car’s heat pump supports a dehumidification mode where it runs refrigerant through the cabin AC evaporator in heating mode.  This mode sometimes turns on when recirc is selected, but not always – it’ll just shut off, let the humidity climb, and instead of re-engaging the evap coil to dehumidify, it just decides to let in fresh external air which costs FAR more energy to heat up than dehumidifying recirc.
Serious lack of reading and comprehension skills displayed here.
Says the guy who thinks A/C on a 2015 car takes up 10% fuel usage.  Gonna need some proof of that.
If your heater can’t overpower the A/C in dehumidify mode, then you have bigger issues than fuel milage anyways.
Correction to the above.  I mean 10% in the winter, when the A/C is most efficient as it can easily dump heat. In the summer up to 10% on an old style bang-bang compressor could be accurate. Most cars past 2010 will also have variable displacement compressors for higher efficiency, very cheap vehicles or manufacturers know for poor quality.
I’m bad at typing…
…very cheap vehicles or manufacturers know for poor quality will still have bang- bang controls for compressors*
If it’s well below freezing outside, there’s not much humidity to start with.
Typically max defrost runs in recirc mode  so its internal humidity, not external.
Many cars have the ability to turn this off. It’s usually through some arcane button pressing sequence.
Have you checked to see if your car can switch it off? Usually this kind of stuff is on user forums
Haha.  Nope.  A 2015, and as close to bare metal as I could get it.  Manual transmission, none of this turn off the engine at stoplights, and a real handbrake.
The A/C is all hardwired, with actual cables and physical switches and knobs you can turn.
There is an arcane sequence to turn off the godforsaken honk-the-horn remote lock noise, involving open the door and inserting the key some number of times.  But nothing on the enviro controls.
I’m not looking forward to getting a new car.
And that’s the proper answer to heated seats sold as a subscription-paid option.
Man after my own heart… I have spent a lot of time gouging out 50,000,000 lumen BLUE power indicators with eyeglass screwdrivers and also gouging to bits the piezo beeper in every microwave. Why does it need to beep constantly, what purpose does it serve? I can tell it’s done because it stopped buzzing and glowing.
At first I thought this might be a workaround for those subscription heated seats. Why is that a thing

  I have spent a lot of time gouging out 50,000,000 lumen BLUE power indicators with eyeglass screwdrivers

I understand the sentiment. But if you want to dim them in a reversible way, I have had success “drawing” over the top of the LED or its light pipe with a black “sharpie” or similar marker.
If you want to be clever, you could cover a piece of clear tape with sharpie, then build up as many layers of tinted tape as you need. If you want to be really clever, there are probably different colours of sharpie that provide the right kind of attenuation for each LED. I haven’t tried this yet.
I wonder if the amber color of kapton tape and its heat resistance might make it a good option for this application.
I have some LED landscape lights that were too bright and too blue. I dimmed them by placing some expanded metal pieces (good riddance to a 10ft satellite dish) over the lens.
I still didn’t like the color of the light. Painting the expanded metal with red primer took care of that. Seemed like a harebrained idea right up to the point where it worked.
The dumbest thing I’ve seen was a humidifier with a blue power indicator bright enough to compete with regular room lighting and turn everything blue. Even with the LED covered by tin foil on the front side, the light spread through the plastic body of the appliance, making the entire thing glow enough to read a book in a dark room.
To add injury to insult, it kept pulsing the light and changing the color periodically, so even when dimmed down by the tin foil, it was still actively distracting. The whole appliance had to be wrapped in dark masking tape, otherwise you couldn’t sleep in the same room.
I have a bedside humidifier with an orange power indicator that put out a ridiculous amount of light. Now nearly completely obscured with aluminum tape, it still functions sufficiently in normal room lighting thanks to the translucence of the white plastic shell.
Links don’t work – they go back to this article.
i know how it looks but this article is the latest chronologically with those “tags”, scroll it down and see
This WireVis tool seems to be getting more and more useful, thanks!
This is the way
IMHO, that’s clever, but very, very complicated way of accomplishing the same results. Funny how things’ complexity is a runaway train of someone else thoughts.
Makes me think car makers (ESPECIALLY the only remaining two US car makers) should go back to basics – sell bunch of parts to whomever buys them, shipped in crates, to be assembled by anyone. Ford used to do that, but not only, it was common practice at the time that car makers sells the frame, the engine, sometimes wheels, etc, and ships it in crates, to be fitted with the custom body made locally. This was way, way before so-called “dealerships” were invented, and way, way before they became de-facto mafias of the car selling in the US, back when we still had real free market unimpeded by monopolies of all kinds.

The nasty courtroom battle between two of the biggest alternative data players has ended in a settlement.
Carlyle-backed Yipit and Jefferies-owned M Science agreed to drop their lawsuits against each other as part of the settlement, according to a person familiar with the arrangement who was not authorized to speak publicly. The details of the settlement have not been made public.
The lawsuits, which centered on claims that two employees stole trade secrets from one rival and passed them on to another, rocked the alternative data world. These firms have grown in scale and revenue as hedge funds and asset managers use their datasets to find differentiated intel to inform bets. Yet, it remains a relatively small industry where everyone knows everyone. The legal drama revealed a side of the industry that had firms worried about how ultra-secretive asset management clients would react.
""There is a sense of industry-wide relief that these companies (and their clients) are out of the spotlight,"" said Don D'Amico, the founder of Glacier Network, which advises data buyers and sellers.
Yipit declined to comment. M Science and Jefferies did not respond to requests for comment.
The fight began in October of 2024 when Yipit, known for providing hedge funds with data drawn from credit card receipts, sued two former employees. It alleged the employees, who had joined its rival, had stolen ""secret information at the heart of Yipit's business,"" including client information and plans for a new dataset focused on Apple.
At the start of this year, Yipit expanded the scope of its lawsuit to include M Science and its leadership, stating that some of the firm's executives encouraged the two former Yipit salespeople to take their former employer's intellectual property. M Science then responded with its own lawsuit, accusing a Yipit employee of viewing M Science data with an outdated login.
While the settlement is a net positive for the burgeoning industry, the fact that it was behind closed doors increases the likelihood of another fight down the road, D'Amico said.
""We're left without legal precedents to apply to future disputes where employees jump to a competitor, which may be more likely to happen in a job market that strongly favors experienced applicants,"" he said.

43,2025-11-25,"MSI's Vector A16 with an RTX 5070 Ti Laptop GPU inside has dropped by a staggering $700 for a limited time.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

When shopping for a new gaming laptop, I always recommend waiting for a big sale. This allows you to cram more performance hardware inside without overspending, making your frames faster and your wallet heavier.
Black Friday deals are in full swing this week, and I've spotted a huge discount on MSI's 16-inch Vector gaming laptop with a Ryzen 9 CPU and RTX 5070 Ti Laptop GPU.
Instead of the regular $1,999.99 price tag, you can now pick up this powerful gaming laptop for just $1,299 at Walmart, a savings of more than $700.
With an NVIDIA RTX 5070 Ti Laptop GPU, AMD Ryzen 9 8940HX CPU, 16GB of RAM, 1TB SSD, and a QHD+ display with 240Hz refresh rate, this MSI gaming laptop will easily handle any of the most demanding titles you throw its way. Full access to NVIDIA's DLSS 4 tools — including Multi Frame Generation — comes standard.
When buying a new gaming laptop, you always want to carefully balance the price-to-performance ratio. Spend too little, and you might end up with a laptop that can't meet the demands of your favorite games. Spend too much, and you might end up with an overkill system and an empty wallet.
This 16-inch MSI Vector A16 is perhaps the perfect PC for an upper mid-range experience. PC gaming veterans will find that the NVIDIA GPU, AMD CPU, and QHD display with 240Hz refresh rate can easily keep up with modern games, and newcomers to the PC gaming scene can get a lot more performance right from the start.
With this deal, you can essentially get an RTX 5070 Ti laptop for the same price that you'd normally spend on a system with an RTX 5060. It's hard to beat that.
 



Because there's one of NVIDIA's latest RTX 5000 Blackwell GPUs inside, the laptop grants full access to DLSS 4 upscaling techniques, including Multi Frame Generation. If you want to see frame rates double, triple, or quadruple with a click of a button, this is the way to go.
The 16-inch form factor's larger cooling system helps prevent any thermal throttling, and it remains far more portable than an 18-inch laptop. There's also plenty of space for ports, including dual USB4, dual USB-A 3.2 (Gen 2), an SD card reader, 2.5Gb Ethernet, and HDMI 2.1.
Black Friday is generally the last big hurrah of deals before the holidays, and this $700 discount was too good not to mention. I'm not exactly sure how long it will last, but I do know that Walmart has both Amazon ($1,419.99) and Best Buy ($1,499.99) beat by a significant margin.
With an NVIDIA RTX 5070 Ti Laptop GPU, AMD Ryzen 9 8940HX CPU, 16GB of RAM, 1TB SSD, and a QHD+ display with 240Hz refresh rate, this MSI gaming laptop will easily handle any of the most demanding titles you throw its way. Full access to NVIDIA's DLSS 4 tools — including Multi Frame Generation — comes standard.

44,2025-11-25,"Huawei's just-announced Mate 80 lineup is attracting attention in China today thanks to a display spec that easily sees off the competition in the premium smartphone segment.
The company claims the OLED panels in its latest phones can reach up to 8,000 nits of peak brightness – a figure that, if independently verified, would make the Mate 80 series the brightest smartphones on the market.
Huawei says all four models – the Mate 80, Mate 80 Pro, Mate 80 Pro Max, and Mate 80 RS – achieve unmatched peak output, but the Pro Max uses a dual-layer OLED design to push 8,000 nits brightness, with superior efficiency and better thermal handling.
The claim positions Huawei well ahead of Apple's latest iPhone 17 models, which top out at 3,000 nits peak outdoor brightness and 1,600 nits HDR peak.
On paper, there's a yawning gap between the figures, but how they're measured is the key. Huawei hasn't said what testing conditions underlie its 8,000-nit claim, and peak brightness metrics often apply only to small portions of the display for very brief moments.
By contrast, Apple says its iPhone 17 models achieve a ""typical"" max brightness of 1,000 nits, while the other specifications describe sustained outdoor or HDR behaviour. That makes direct comparisons difficult until reviewers can test the Mate 80 displays in controlled conditions. 
There are also practical questions surrounding Huawei's figures. Real-world visibility isn't just about peak output – it depends on factors such as viewing angle, reflectivity, contrast, and colour accuracy.
If Huawei's numbers hold up under testing, the Mate 80 series could signal another leap in smartphone display performance. For now, the claims highlight how aggressively some manufacturers are pushing OLED panel brightness as a key differentiator.
Other notable specs in the Mate 80 series include high-end camera systems with variable-aperture main sensors and multiple telephoto lenses, RAM options reaching 20GB on the top models, and large batteries up to 6,000 mAh paired with fast wired and wireless charging.
The Mate 80 Pro Max starts at CNY 7,999 (about $1,127) in China, while the top-tier Mate 80 RS Master Edition comes in at CNY 11,999 (about $1,683). The prices place the highest-end models firmly in flagship territory, even before considering storage upgrades.

45,2025-11-25,"For many Thanksgiving menus, stuffing is a must — but the countless recipes and techniques can make this Turkey Day staple feel overwhelming. 
In search of the best stuffing recipe, I turned to celebrity chefs Ina Garten, Paula Deen, Ree Drummond, and Sunny Anderson. Here's how their recipes stacked up. 
Unlike the other recipes I tested, Garten's stuffing requires only one type of bread — baguettes — which made it easier to prepare.
I also appreciated the addition of fresh herbs, but was unsure how I'd like the apples and almonds combined with the savory onions and celery. This recipe yields a huge portion, so I cut it in half.
Overall, the process was pretty simple. While the bread was drying in the oven at 300 degrees Fahrenheit for about 10 minutes, I sautéed the veggies, apples, and herbs in a saucepan with butter.
Once the mixture was combined, I poured it and the vegetable stock over the bread cubes.
This recipe calls for cooking the filling inside a turkey cavity for two-and-a-half hours at 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
I wasn't making a turkey for this taste test, so I baked the stuffing at the same temperature in a shallow dish for an hour instead. 
The final dish was pretty crispy and golden on top, but its center looked less appetizing. 
The texture was OK, and the insides definitely seemed soggy. I probably could've avoided this by adding a little less broth than instructed. 
Next time, I'd definitely omit the nuts. I used slivered almonds, and their crunchiness, size, and shape threw off the dish's overall texture.
The crusty breaded exterior was delicious and added all of the crunch this dish needed. 
I could definitely taste the rosemary, and I actually enjoyed the apples, which added a slight sweetness to the stuffing that balanced the other savory flavors.
In true Deen fashion, this stuffing recipe calls for a full stick of butter. 
I was also unsure about the mixture of carbs here — saltine crackers, white bread, and cornbread, which I made from scratch using Deen's recipe.
For the carbs, I started by making cornbread — a quick and easy process that resulted in a savory, slightly dense dish — and dried white-bread slices in the oven.
I then sautéed the veggies with the stick of butter and mixed all of the prepared ingredients in a bowl. 
When adding the vegetable stock, I stopped after about five cups because the mixture already looked far too soggy. I was shocked that the recipe asked for seven cups.
Still concerned about the texture, I poured out more broth before adding five eggs to the mix.
I then transferred everything into a shallow, glass baking dish. It took about an hour in the oven for the mix to really crisp up.
The top was slightly golden, but it didn't get as crispy as the other recipes I tested. 
When I took a bite, I found the interior was far too soggy — there was definitely too much broth, and the crackers turned mushy after absorbing the liquid. 
The flavor was OK — very savory and buttery — but the extra-soggy texture was not appetizing. 
If I made this again, I'd swap some of the crackers for more bread and use significantly less broth.  
The Pioneer Woman's recipe calls for a lot of bread — three different types, including homemade cornbread. Since I already had the ingredients needed to make Deen's cornbread, I used that option for this dish as well. 
In addition to a large amount of bread, this recipe also requires a lot of parsley.
I noticed a little too late that I was supposed to dry the bread out for one to two days, but I threw it in the oven at 300 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 minutes, and it still firmed up really well. 
In general, this recipe had a similar process to the other two, from making the cornbread and dehydrating the other carbs to sautéeing the veggies. 
The recipe instructed me to add six cups of broth to the sautéed vegetables, then ladle this mixture onto the tossed bread cubes until they were soaked to my liking.
I preferred this approach, as it was easier to control and prevent the stuffing from becoming soggy. 
My stuffing took about 40 minutes in the oven — not the 20 to 30 minutes the recipe called for — but the extra time helped it achieve a crisp, golden top.
Although the stuffing was toasty on top, it still looked soggy inside.
However, upon tasting it, the dish's flavor and texture weren't bad at all. The center was slightly soggy but not overwhelmingly so, and the extra-crispy top helped balance the texture. 
My only issue with this recipe was that it had way too much celery. I'm not a fan of it in general, but I can tolerate it in moderate amounts — still, almost every bite tasted strongly of it. 
That said, the savory, herby bites with minimal celery were delicious. 
Anderson's simple and quick recipe combines store-bought stuffing mix with sautéed veggies, broth, and herbs to make it taste homemade. 
I swapped turkey stock for vegetable broth since I wasn't eating meat products at the time, and I left out the thyme as a personal preference. 
Anderson also shared four add-on combinations to give the dish more flavor — sausage and bell peppers, oysters and hard-boiled eggs, walnuts and apples, and sautéed fennel bulb and dried apricots. I opted for the last combo. 
This recipe was quick to put together. For the base, I just dumped the stuffing mix into a bowl and added freshly chopped parsley. 
I got to work mincing the garlic and chopping the onion, celery, fennel bulb, sage, and dried apricots. Then I cooked the veggies, sage, garlic, salt, and pepper in a pan until the mix started to soften.
After combining the sautéed mixture with the boxed stuffing and vegetable broth, I added the dried apricots and pressed everything into a glass baking dish. 
I covered the whole thing with foil and let it bake for 45 minutes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Then, I removed the foil and cooked it for an additional 15 minutes at 400 degrees.
I was worried this recipe would turn out too soggy since it's meant to be a wet dressing, but it actually baked up really well.
It came out of the oven with a soft, almost creamy center and an extra-crispy exterior. 
The sautéed veggies created a very savory flavor profile, and I couldn't even taste the celery. 
I was also a little unsure about the apricots, but they added a touch of sweetness and melt-in-your-mouth texture. 
If I had to choose a favorite, I'd go for Anderson's unique stuffing.
I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the fennel-and-apricot combination — it added an interesting twist to the dish but still felt traditional. Plus, this recipe was the quickest and easiest to make.
I also loved the flavor of Garten's herby stuffing with rosemary and apple, but next time, I'd leave out the almonds and use less broth.
Deen's recipe had an enjoyable savory, buttery flavor, but it needed far less liquid to fix the texture. I think adding more bread would also help. 
For Drummond's stuffing, I'd use slightly less broth for an even better texture and way less celery to help the flavor of the sautéed veggies and fresh herbs shine.

Black Friday 2025SteamSteam Deck 
Valve’s cheapest Steam Deck model just got cheaper. The Steam Deck LCD 256GB will be 20 percent off for Black Friday 2025, making it somehow $20 less than the portable gaming console that Nintendo released back in 2017.Â 
Normally $400, Valve’s three-year-old PC gaming handheld will be 20 percent off through December 1, making it just $320 to pick up compared to a new Switch after Nintendo raised the prices earlier this year over tariffs. It’s also $100 less than a Switch 2, which runs games like Cyberpunk 2077 better, but doesn’t have access to Steam’s ever-growing library of new weekly indie hits like this year’s Megabonk.
Valve also ran this promotion for the LCD Steam Deck ahead of the Autumn Steam Sale back in September, suggesting to me that it’s looking to clear out stock as it focuses production on the superior but more expensive OLED models. The Steam Deck is out matched on specs by more recent PC gaming handhelds like the Rog Xbox Ally X and Lenovo Legion Go 2 but still offers the most bang for your buck.
It might struggle with some newer high-end blockbusters, but even games like Assassin’s Creed ShadowsÂ can run surprisingly well. Plus, Steam remains the day-one launch pad for Early Access games and all of the big hits from Vampire Survivors to Balatro.
As for aÂ  Steam Deck successor, well, it doesn’t sound like Valve is planning on launching one anytime soon. “We’re really interested to work on what’s next for Steam Deckâ¦the thing we’re making sure of is that it’s a worthwhile enough performance upgrade to make sense as a standalone product,” Valve software engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais told IGN earlier this month.
That echoed comments he made back in 2023 tempering expectations of a hardware revision anytime soon. “I donât anticipate such a leap to be possible in the next couple of years, but weâre still closely monitoring innovations in architectures and fabrication processes to see where things are going there,” he said.
Sounds like nothing’s changed. The current Steam Deck should be Valve’s default at least for a couple more years.
Correction 11/25/25 11:55 a.m. ET: The sale is 20 percent off, not 80, obviously.

51,2025-11-25,"Tires are the only physical part that touches the ground at all times. This makes them invaluable for safety, performance, efficiency, and comfort. The current U.S. tire market is vast. It encompasses an estimated value of over $56 billion (2025). In this market, some tire brands set the standards others follow, and one brand consistently tops them all in customer satisfaction: Michelin.
According to a recent customer satisfaction survey by Consumer Reports, Michelin, alongside Vredestein, ranks as number one. J.D. Power's 2025 Tire Customer Satisfaction Study also ranks Michelin highest in the performance tire segment. Even though Goodyear outperformed Michelin in the passenger car and luxury car categories, Michelin has won a total of 103 J.D. Power awards, more than all others combined.
Moreover, a customer satisfaction survey conducted by analytics company HundredX Inc. for Tire Business also ranked Michelin as the top brand across most categories. Michelin was also ranked number 1 in our own 2025 ranking of major tire brands. With a second-best 11.7% market share in the U.S., only slightly behind Goodyear, Michelin continues to stand out as one of the best tire brands in the eyes of consumers — and here's why customers prefer Michelin.
Michelin is at the leading edge of the tire industry. They innovate continuously, are committed to sustainability, lead in customer satisfaction, and rank at the top in performance and safety. For example, according to a 2025 research by ADAC, Michelin's tire wear particle ratings are considerably lower than competitors'. This helps Michelin tires last longer, enhances safety and efficiency, and is kinder to the environment.
In the high-performance and motorsport realm, Michelin is also at the cutting edge. For a spot of context, the Porsche 919 Evo beat an F1 car at the Nürburgring, setting a world record lap of 5:19.55 sporting Michelin tires. The Bugatti Chiron Super Sport used Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires for its 300mph+ run, while the Rimac Nevera set its own 258mph EV record on road-legal Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 R tires.
Safety-wise, Michelin supports the EU's R117‑04 regulation. This means that Michelin tires can maintain wet braking performance even when worn to the legal limit of 1.6mm. In 2024, according to the Institute for European Traffic Laws, only one tire manufacturer managed to reach these standards, and it was Michelin. With such standards and continuous innovation, Michelin is the world's most valuable tire brand.
If you've even wondered whether it makes sense to spend a bit extra on premium tires instead of cheaper options, numbers and satisfaction surveys such as these send a clear message. Innovation within the tire industry isn't just marketing plays and brand value pumping — it has a lot to do with basic on-road safety and how our cars interact with our environments. Premium tires last longer, perform better, are safer, and are more comfortable.
A 2025 Consumer Reports survey focused on what motivates buyers to choose certain tires. The findings were also quite telling. 74% of buyers prioritized wet traction, 73% prioritized handling, and 66% prioritized treadwear. These are the exact metrics where premium tires offer a significant advantage over cheaper options. Treadwear-wise, premium tires often cover twice or three times as much as a budget tire. So, even though they may cost more to buy outright, they can last much longer."

It’s a good day to be an Google shareholder. Even amid this week's sharp tech rally, the stock is emerging as a Wall Street darling. 
As of Tuesday morning, shares of the tech giant are exploding higher, and the reason reaches far beyond the company’s best-known business lines — whether search, ads, or YouTube. This time around, what’s most exciting are Google parent Alphabet’s AI initiatives and products — plus what you might call a rapid shift in investor perception. 
Shares in Alphabet were up about 1.3% in Tuesday morning trading, putting the company's market capitalization at about $3.9 trillion. The stock is up almost 70% so far this year.
Meanwhile, Nvidia stock was off more than 5% Tuesday morning, continuing its recent selloff following a report that Meta may use Google's AI chips. Nvidia stock has dropped almost 10% in the last month, though it remains up 25% on the year.
Here's what to know.
Over the past six weeks alone, Alphabet stock has shot up almost 35%, adding about $1 trillion in market value and putting the Google parent on track to cross the $4 trillion threshold for the first time. 
Google would be just the second company in U.S. stock market history to hit a $4 trillion market cap, one step behind AI chip powerhouse Nvidia. Nvidia hit a $5 trillion market cap last month before retreating. Nvidia's market cap was all the way back to less than $4.2 trillion on Tuesday morning.
Investors were already warming to Google stock after the disclosure earlier this month that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has quietly built a multibillion-dollar position in Alphabet during the third-quarter — its first-ever stake in the tech giant. For a famously value-seeking shop, that amounts to an endorsement. It signals that Alphabet’s AI strategy is more legit than hype, and that the stock valuation offers room for the sort of significant upside that Buffett’s team looks for. 
Alphabet isn’t just giving Nvidia a run for its market cap position. It’s also now being viewed as the most credible challenger to Nvidia in the fast-growing market for AI accelerators.
Most notably, Alphabet’s new Gemini model — its largest and most-sophisticated AI system yet — is being received with unusually positive early reports. Investors, until recent weeks, had worried Alphabet might be falling behind with its AI models. But instead, the launch has reframed the company as a forward-looking heavyweight in what is arguably the entire tech sector’s most competitive space. 
Also powering the historic run are reports that Meta may be in talks to buy Google-designed AI chips. Meta is one of the largest AI spenders in the world — so much so that its capital expenditures have recently spooked investors. Any shift of its budget away from Nvidia could have tremendous, highly valuable implications. Even if a deal never maweterializes, the fact that Alphabet is in the conversation signals how far its in-house offerings have come.
All in all, Alphabet sat just about $300 billion south of Nvidia’s market cap on Tuesday. That gap once looked unbridgeable. After the past month, it suddenly looks like the next big tech race.
Alphabet went public in August 2004 at $2.13 a share, split-adjusted. Since the IPO, the stock has returned approximately about 15,000%. In practical terms, that means that every dollar invested in Alphabet’s IPO would now be worth around $150. "
55,2025-11-25,"Data breaches are getting so common that it can be hard to know how to react when it happens to you. It's often easy to shrug it off, but there's a risk.
Being a victim of a data breach increases your chances of being targeted by criminals and scammers.
Sue told the BBC how scammers went after her. We found her details had been leaked online.
She was a victim of what's known as a Sim swap attack - where scammers trick a network operator into thinking they're the account holder to get a new Sim card for a mobile device.
They used it to take over almost all her online accounts through her phone. She said the experience was ""horrible"".
""The scammers took over my Gmail account and then locked me out of my bank accounts because they failed security checks,"" she said.
Sue also had a credit card opened in her name and the criminals purchased more than £3,000 in vouchers.
It took several trips to the branches of her bank and mobile phone provider to get her accounts back.
And the thieves weren't done.
""The criminals also did a sinister thing after breaking into my WhatsApp,"" she said. ""They sent messages to horse riding groups I am in warning there were people on their way to stab the horses.""
We searched hacker databases using online tools like haveibeenpwned.com and Constella Intelligence to see if Sue's details were previously compromised.
Her phone number, email address, date of birth and physical address were all exposed in data breaches at gambling platform PaddyPower in 2010 and email validation tool Verifications.io in 2019. Other compilations of hacked records also included her details.
Hannah Baumgaertner, from cyber firm Silobreaker, said attackers likely used the personal data leaked in previous breaches to conduct the Sim swap attack.
""Once they had access to Sue's phone number they were were able to intercept any security codes sent to verify her identity for her Gmail account,"" she said.
But scammers aren't always targeting big payouts.
Fran from Brazil told the BBC she found a user had registered to her Netflix account  - and increased her monthly subscription.
""I was charged $9.90 (£7.50) on my payment card, even though I hadn't made this purchase,"" she said. 
""I immediately contacted my family to find out if anyone had added another profile to the account we share, but they all said no.""
Fran was a victim of a common scam where her Netflix account was hijacked by a freeloader.
It's not known exactly how they got into her account and the murky world of cybercrime means it is difficult to pinpoint if a single data breach led to someone being scammed.
But we found Fran's email address had been exposed in at least four data breaches including hacks of Internet Archive (2024), Trellov (2024), Descomplica (2021) and Wattpad (2020) according to the website haveibeenpwned.com.
The password she used for her Netflix account is not in publicly known databases but might be in others.
""There is a huge market for cracked Netflix, Disney and Spotify accounts"", said Alon Gal, co founder of cyber security company Hudson Rock.
""It's a low-barrier entry point for cybercrime, turning one company's data leak into widespread, ongoing abuse.""
Scammers often combine stolen private information with public information.
Leah, who didn't want to give her real name, runs a small business using Facebook adverts and was recently targeted in a long running scam apparently originating from Vietnam.
""I got a phishing email from 'notifications@facebookmail.com' saying that I was due a refund. I clicked on the link and entered my details on the fake Meta page and the scammers were able to take over my business account even though I had 2 factor authentication.
""They then posted child sexual abuse videos under my name which got me blocked. I was even barred from using Messenger to complain to Meta.""
In the three days it took Leah to get back her business account back the scammers had run hundreds of pounds of adverts paid for by her. She eventually got the money back.
Alberto Casares from Constella Intelligence searched hacker databases and found Leah's email address and other details were taken in data breaches at Gravatar (2020) and this year's Qantas (third-party breach).
""It looks like the attackers used a common technique of linking up Leah's private stolen email address with her publicly listed business number to launch a targeted phishing attack against the email account.""
They could have done this themselves or used a data broker to pay for a number of potential targets he said.
Mass data breaches are fuelling scams and secondary hacks around the world, with several high profile attacks coming in 2025 alone.
According to Proton Mail's Data Breach Observatory, there have been 794 verified breaches from identifiable sources discovered so far in 2025 with more than 300 million individual records exposed.
""Criminals pay premium prices for stolen data because it consistently generates profit through fraud, extortion, and cyberattacks,"" said Eamonn Maguire from the firm.
Aside from notifying customers and regulators about breaches, there are no hard and fast rules on what companies should do for victims.
Offering free credit monitoring, for example, used to be common.
Last year, Ticketmaster (which saw 500m people affected by a breach) offered this to some people.
But this year fewer firms are doing this. Marks and Spencer and Qantas, for example, have not offered these services to customers.
Co-op chose to give victims a £10 voucher - if they spent £40 in its shops.
Some are trying to seek compensation in the courts, with a growing trend of class action lawsuits - though these are notoriously hard to win because it is difficult to prove how individuals have been impacted.
But some have been successful.
T-Mobile has begun paying customers affected by a major data breach in 2021 which affected 76m customers.
The firm agreed to pay $350m - with payments reportedly ranging from $50 to $300.

56,2025-11-25,"Sentiment has shifted dramatically in favor of an interest rate cut.
Top officials at the Federal Reserve have displayed a rare degree of public disagreement over a possible interest rate cut next month.
In recent days, sentiment shifted dramatically in favor of an interest rate cut as some influential central bankers voiced openness toward the move, futures markets showed. Still, discord remains.
A rate cut could reduce expenses associated with everything from home mortgages to credit cards to car payments, making it cheaper to get a loan or refinance one.
The policy would also ease borrowing for businesses and potentially boost hiring, but it risks driving up inflation at a time when many Americans struggle with everyday costs.
“We haven’t seen this much uncertainty from the Fed in a long time,” John Sedunov, a finance professor at Villanova University's School of Business, told ABC News.
Here’s what to know about why the Fed is divided over its rate decision and what the policy could mean for you.
Why is the Fed divided over a possible interest rate cut?
Inflation has picked up in recent months, putting price increases a full percentage point above the Fed’s target of 2%. Meanwhile, hiring has slowed, posing a risk of an economic double-whammy known as ""stagflation.""
Those conditions have put the Fed in a bind, since the central bank must balance a dual mandate to keep inflation under control and maximize employment. To address pressure on both of its goals, the Fed primarily holds a single tool: interest rates.
“We have one tool,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a press conference in Washington, D.C., last month. “You can’t address both of those at once.”
If the Fed holds interest rates steady as a means of protecting against tariff-induced inflation, it risks a deeper slowdown of the labor market. On the other hand, if the Fed lowers rates to stimulate the economy in the face of a hiring slowdown, it threatens to boost spending and worsen inflation.
Policymakers at the Fed disagree about whether to prioritize containing inflation or jolting employment, John Sedunov, a finance professor at Villanova University's School of Business, told ABC News.
“The Fed is fighting with this idea: Do we push inflation more toward our goal or do we do something about the job market?” Sedunov said. “It’s a tough line to walk.”
Why is momentum building in favor of an interest rate cut?
The odds have shifted significantly in favor of an interest rate cut at the Fed’s next meeting.
The chances of a quarter-point interest rate cut stand at nearly 85%, surging from a level as low as 30% last week, according to CME FedWatch Tool, a measure of market sentiment.
The prospects appeared to move in response to a murky jobs report and public statements from two allies of Powell on the committee charged with setting rates.
On Friday, a jobs report for September sent mixed signals about the labor market. Employers added far more workers than expected in September, though hiring fell short of a breakneck clip. Meanwhile the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4%, a low figure by historical standards but the highest recorded since October 2021.
New York Fed President John Williams, who is often in lockstep with Powell, on Friday voiced openness toward a rate cut, telling reporters he still saw “room for a further adjustment in the near term.”
Days later, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daley took a similar position, telling reporters she sees room “for a further adjustment in the near term.” Daley, who isn’t voting on interest rates this year, is widely viewed as a supporter of Powell.
“Both of them came out in pretty clear support of a rate cut,” Joseph Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former Federal Reserve official, told ABC News. “Both are pretty centrist and close to chair [Powell].”
“A week ago, things were up in the air. They mostly moved because of Williams and Daley,” Gagnon added.
What would an interest rate cut mean for you?
A quarter-point interest rate cut would reduce the Fed’s benchmark rate to a level between 3.5% and 3.75%.
That figure would mark a significant pullback from a peak in 2023. At the outset of the pandemic, interest rates stood at 0%.
Still, a reduction of interest rates could offer some relief for mortgage and credit card borrowers. Savers, however, stand to lose income as interest rates decline for accounts held at banks.

57,2025-11-25,"Is it ‘Aluminium OS’ or just ChromeOS, reborn? Google’s desktop future is more ambitious than its name.

Google is quietly setting the stage for one of its biggest platform pivots in years, and new evidence points to a new desktop-centric version of Android taking shape under the name Aluminium OS.
A recent job listing on LinkedIn, spotted by Telegram user Frost Core, describes Google as working on “a new Aluminium, Android-based operating system,” which all but confirms the project’s existence, Android Authority reports. But at the same time, internal references to “non-Aluminium ChromeOS” suggest that Aluminium may be an internal codename used by Google’s engineering teams.
This shift is not unexpected. Android leads on phones and tablets, and ChromeOS is popular in schools and basic laptops. But Google hasn’t managed to enter the mainstream PC market, which is still ruled by Windows and macOS.
That leaves Google with a clear path: unify its strengths and build a desktop-class platform on top of Android, rather than trying to stretch ChromeOS further. The job listing backs this up, revealing that Aluminium OS is meant to run on laptops, detachables, tablets, and mini-PCs. Google is also designing this system with AI woven into its core, making full use of its Gemini models and signalling that whatever comes next won’t just be ChromeOS with a different coat of paint.
More hints come from the hardware roadmap. Engineers mention distinct tiers such as AL Entry, AL Mass Premium, and AL Premium — labels that sit alongside existing “Chromebook” and “Chromebook Plus” categories. This suggests that Aluminium-based machines might co-exist with ChromeOS for a while, and it’s not limiting the new OS to budget machines. If anything, Aluminium seems designed to scale from cheap student laptops to premium hardware — exactly the space where ChromeOS has struggled to thrive.
The transition won’t be sudden either. Google’s own wording talks about guiding the company “from ChromeOS to Aluminium with business continuity.""
The name is still uncertain. “Aluminium” matches Google’s internal codename style, but it doesn’t scream consumer branding. It might appear on retail devices, or Google might fold the new system under the ChromeOS banner to avoid confusing buyers.

Until the company locks it in, Aluminium is best understood as a label for the platform’s development phase, even if it strongly hints at the future direction of Google’s desktop efforts. The first devices running this Android-based desktop OS are expected to arrive in 2026, and that’s when Google will finally have to decide what name it wants the world to say out loud.

Amazon's Alexa Plus has officially launched in Canada, following its launch in the U.S. earlier this year. According to the e-commerce giant, the new and improved AI model is all set to be ""smarter, more conversational, more capable.""
Amazon states that the Canadian edition of Alexa Plus is specifically tailored to the country's culture. It is said to recognize regional slang, keep up with Canadian sports teams, and know the local music and culture. Which means it can confidently handle unique Canadian subjects like questions about your favorite hockey team or musician.
Compared to the first model, Alexa Plus is said to be more intuitive, conversational, and you can talk to it more naturally. For instance, you can say things like, “I’m cold,” and Alexa+ knows to turn up the heat, or “It’s dark,” and the lights come on automatically, instead of saying an entire sentence.
 



Additionally, with Alexa Plus, users can get their trip itineraries with Fodors, news from CBC, and also connect to Canadian arts/music, and online shopping with suggestions. Amazon also states that partnerships with Yelp, Uber Eats, Suno, and TripAdvisor are in the works.
For music, you can simply ask, “Alexa, play my favourite artist,” and it will start on your nearest Echo Show. If you move to another area, like the living room, you can continue the music by saying, “Alexa, move the music here.”
 



Amazon says that Alexa Plus will understand the user's daily routine, travel preferences, or how you like to unwind after work, and will use that information to plan your work more smoothly.
So much so that Alexa will recognize when you've had a stressful day at work and might set a relaxing atmosphere by dimming the lights and playing your favourite music, followed by suggesting a brief pre-sleep meditation. The new AI is more intuitive, start warming your home before you arrive, start the coffee when you wake, or flag when a favourite show drops a new episode

""This is what we call ambient AI: technology that empowers you without getting in your way, without distracting you from what matters most,"" Amazon added in its press release.
That said, Alexa Plus has already rolled out to Canadians and costs $27.99 per month, but is free for all Prime members.

Insta360 has stolen market share from GoPro and DJI in recent years as it transformed from an upstart challenger into the definitive action camera brand that content creators and adventure people reach for first. It’s been the combination of innovative 360-degree capture, AI-powered editing and useful features like the invisible selfie stick effect that positioned Insta360 as the company pushing boundaries while established competitors iterated incrementally.
The X5 launched in April as its feature-packed flagship model justifying the premium positioning, but this Black Friday brings the first significant discount: At $464, down from $549, this 8K 360-degree camera has hit a record-low price on Amazon and delivers everything that made Insta360 the action camera leader.
See at Amazon
The dual 1/1.28-inch sensors work together to capture 8K resolution at 30fps across the full 360-degree field of view for footage that has incredible detail and survives aggressive cropping and reframing in post with ease. This resolution counts because 360-degree cameras need excess capture area so you can choose your framing after the fact rather than commit to an angle at the time of recording. These larger sensors also improve on low-light performance, color accuracy, and dynamic range compared to the smaller sensors on competing action cameras and turn out footage that looks professional.
This game-changing, triple AI chip design distributes processing across specialized silicon for real-time noise reduction, image processing, and AI-assisted features – all operating concurrently without thermal throttling or performance compromise. But this architecture really lets you fly when shooting in tough low-light conditions that leave competitors’ cameras producing unusable grainy footage, delivering clean video even during those golden hours, indoor scenes, or nighttime adventures. Advanced features such as auto subject-tracking, horizon leveling, and smart reframing-all using AI to analyze 360-degree footage for ideal crop point suggestions that capture the action-are powered by onboard AI processing.
The invisible selfie stick effect is Insta360’s signature feature which creates impossible third-person perspectives that make it seem like a drone or cameraman is following you. It captures 360 degrees of everything, including the extended selfie stick, which the stitching algorithm intelligently removes from the final footage via geometric analysis and image processing. That gives you the cinematic shots you dream of: a floating camera tracking your movements in places that feel professionally filmed but are completely self-operated.
FlowState stabilization combined with 360-degree Horizon Lock eliminates the need for gimbals through computational stabilization, analyzing motion and then correcting it through post-processing. Stabilization handles aggressive movements, bumps, crashes, and full camera rotations while maintaining level, smooth footage that looks professionally stabilized. The horizon lock specifically ensures the horizon line stays perfectly level regardless of how the camera tumbles or rotates during action sequences, preventing the disorienting tilted footage that ruins otherwise great action shots.
The replaceable lens system is a practical innovation in itself as it protects your investment by allowing quick lens swaps the moment scratches, cracks, or damage occur. Traditional action cameras require expensive repairs or an outright replacement when lenses get damaged in crashes, drops, or impacts that inevitably occur during action sports. The X5’s lenses detach and replace in mere seconds without requiring tools, thus enabling one to take spare lenses along on extended trips or adventures where lens damage becomes likely.
The advanced 4-microphone array captures clearer audio by first reducing the amount of wind interference that usually ruins action camera soundtracks. It does this through several microphones placed strategically around the camera body, combined with AI processing that identifies and suppresses wind noise while preserving voice and ambient sounds.
At $464, the Insta360 X5 brings 8K 360-degree video, triple AI chip processing, invisible selfie stick compatibility, FlowState stabilization, replaceable lenses, and enhanced wind reduction at 15% off retail this Black Friday. Insta360 remains the market leader over GoPro and DJI not because of incremental spec bumps but rather through relentless innovation in features that actually matter to content creators.

64,2025-11-25,"Even failures and half steps will be more interesting than the boring stuff.
Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.
Twenty-five years into the 21st century, culture is markedly different than it was in the previous millennium. Everyday life has never contained more stuff—an endless reel of words, ideas, games, songs, videos, memes, outrageous statements, celebrity meltdowns, life hacks, extremely talented animals. Yet audiences can sense what’s missing. For all the energy society invests in culture today, little has emerged that feels new, and certainly nothing revolutionary enough to properly outmode the past.
Some commentators have argued that cultural progress is at a standstill. In The Crisis of Culture, published in English in 2024, the French political scientist Olivier Roy claims that the canon has been abandoned, subcultures have been reduced to superficial identity groups, and the marketplace has swallowed everything. As a full diagnosis, this seems too pessimistic. In its broadest definition, culture always exists, and subcultures remain—there are just fewer conspicuous ones now, and those have less influence. The canon is not dead; the problem, rather, is that it casts too long a shadow over the present. Kurt Cobain would have wanted the next generation’s musicians and listeners to kill their idols, including him. Instead, they wear his face on T-shirts.
Still, the lingering reverence toward Cobain and other larger-than-life 20th-century artists suggests a deeply rooted collective respect for the agents of radical cultural change. What’s missing now is a veneration of the artistic mindset, which possesses the imagination to reject kitsch—art that trades in well-worn formulas, stock emotions, and immediate comprehensibility—and pursue work that expands the possibilities of human perception. Doing so requires at least some creators in the cultural ecosystem to strive for complexity, ambiguity, and formal experimentation—attributes that power the masterpieces that draw millions of people every year to museums.
The first step in reversing cultural stagnation is to accept that artistic invention is a social good. And like so many other social goods, it isn’t necessarily going to have its production prioritized by the market. We—creators and audiences alike—have to make an effort to encourage bold new forms of culture. Even failures and half steps will be more interesting than overly market-tested products.
Restoring cultural invention doesn’t require upending the current industries—it just needs a small vanguard to change its direction. Throughout history, dedicated enclaves, such as the avant-garde artists of the early 20th century and urban subcultures of the late 20th century, have pursued innovation without the promise of immediate financial reward. Creating more of these communities and supporting them is crucial.
Perhaps the key way of doing this is to restore collectively meaningful, noneconomic incentives for the creation of art. For more than a century, the world’s most creative people have been suspicious of “social norms.” Norms were, after all, the foundation of middle-class respectability—the very thing that stifled genius—and by the mid-20th century, to be “cool” meant rejecting staid convention. Eventually, a great number of multinational corporations agreed: Customs, manners, and taboos were merely obstacles to market expansion.
The result was a world in which only money provided a universal sense of value. In turn, the erosion of norms left us defenseless against disinhibited opportunists who learned to hack the system. The media have dutifully amplified every outrage, and norm breakers, such as Kanye West (who now goes by “Ye”) and Donald Trump, rose as our cultural leaders through sheer volume of content alone.
But social norms remain a powerful tool for ensuring that self-interest doesn’t erode the collective good. Consider the late-20th-century taboo against “selling out,” a norm that steered young artists away from chasing wealth as they pursued their art. Because experimentation rarely paid in the short term, social rewards—status, respect, admiration—became vital for sustaining artists on a path of invention.
Critics play a significant role in this process. Although critics have been writing about popular culture for decades, they had traditionally used their platforms to elevate daring, innovative work. These positive reviews conferred status on artists, helping audiences feel a sense of pride in their affinity for “cult” works. The director David Lynch died a legend because of critical support and cultish fandom, not the rewards of the marketplace.
This is not the direction that criticism veered in the 21st century, however. An emerging set of critics worried that complex, experimental culture was inherently elitist, deployed by the educated to make everyone else feel inferior. In this view, dismissing pop culture wasn’t just snobbery; it denied people their right to take pleasure from their favorite bangers and bops. But in focusing too much on what was popular, critics began to write about culture like sports, concentrating most on the major leagues.
Culture isn’t sports, though. The minor leagues of niche subcultures and marginalized communities have always been the most important crucibles of innovation. Passive consumers indifferent (or even hostile) to high art may not actively seek out challenging work, but they instinctively grow bored with repetition. Hip-hop’s longevity comes from its ability to follow the lead of its young Turks, resulting in a decades-long chain of stylistic evolution. When critics deny this central dynamic by overfocusing on the big players, they help create a landscape that feels stagnant, even if interesting stuff is happening out there somewhere.
Read: The diminishing returns of having good taste
A much more expansive critical approach means thinking about culture as a sort of terroir. When forward-thinking artists are celebrated, their original ideas eventually permeate other layers of the cultural ecosystem, ensuring that even mainstream culture becomes vibrant and exciting rather than interminably recycling its own past. Everybody wins. Critics and tastemakers play an essential role in this work, but they must, as the late cultural theorist Mark Fisher wrote, abandon cynicism and believe again that audiences are capable of engaging “with cultural products that are complex and intellectually demanding.”
Artists themselves also have to rethink their work outside the individual pursuit of fame and profit. Every enduring cultural movement—hip-hop, rock, punk, streetwear—began as an insular, tightly knit community of like-minded peers that formed out of a dissatisfaction with the conventional and a deep desire to create something new. Historically, these subcultures existed in real-world spaces—clubs, skate parks, dive bars, DIY venues—where ideas evolved organically.
Today, such subcultures have largely migrated online. Although digital spaces allow people to find their niches more easily, the omnipresence of pop culture means that some of the most energetic subcultures are now fan communities devoted to existing mass-market entertainment—or nihilistic trolls whose innovations are unlikely to ever inspire worthwhile artists. Yet subcultures operating in the old model—such as drag queens, Chicago drill, and Atlanta trap—have profoundly reshaped culture at large. Mainstream consumers still crave the energy of subcultural innovation and enjoy seeing underground ideas fused with commercial styles. But the existing places to pull from are nearly exhausted, and reviving culture requires a new generation of outsiders willing to create their own movements from scratch.
Unfortunately, the current media ecosystem discourages this. The major internet platforms encourage creators to chase virality rather than cultivate smaller, self-sustaining communities. Global brands tease lucrative deals to emerging artists and micro-influencers, reinforcing the idea that “getting the bag” is the ultimate goal. As the art critic Jerry Saltz has observed, “It’s almost impossible for fragile underground scenes to grow, get nurtured, and take root, especially when we move at light speed.” Ice Spice, who came up in the drill scene, faced little pushback for taking money from Dunkin’. In an era when we live as personal brands, every decision is made to increase our own shareholder value.
Making art with lasting meaning requires resisting the pull of instant exposure and early buyouts. We must think through ways to encourage artists to disappear into their own worlds for a while, developing ideas away from corporate influence and assimilation. Not everyone will have the discipline or capacity for this, but those who do or can will shape the future. And the least that critics and fans can do is give them esteem—when justified—for attempting to move culture forward, instead of ignoring them as marginal, castigating them as pretentious, or belittling their view counts. The past 25 years have taught us that the contemporary economy and media will not prioritize creative invention. The question is: Will you?

If anything is nearly guaranteed to sell out before Black Friday deals ends, it’s an Apple product. Shoppers flock to Apple’s tech during big sale events, and it’s not hard to see why. With their usually high prices, everlasting popularity, genuine usefulness and the ever-changing Apple ecosystem, there’s always a new model or gadget worth grabbing.
To give you a head start on the race to buy Apple products on sale before the stock runs out, we rounded up some of the best deals here. You can find everything from AirTags to AirPods, charging devices and cords, iPads and more, available on sale at Amazon, Target and Walmart. Whether you just need to replace a broken charger or have been eyeing the latest iPad, now is the time — as shopping experts, we’re pretty sure that deals like this won’t come back around for months, at least.
Come on now. At this point, you know all about Apple's AirTags. If you already use them, then you know that their ability to help you track and recover everything from your keys to your phone to your cat is pretty priceless.
If you're new here, then here’s how they work: Each AirTag can ping its own location, so when you attach it to one of your belongings, you can track that item via Apple’s Find My app, which is available in the cloud and on Apple devices like iPhones, laptops and more. Through Find My, you can even tell your AirTag to play a sound so it’s easier to find. People love these things for a reason and they're always finding new ways to get the best out of them. You can buy them as single tags or in a four-pack.
Upgrade your workout, daily commute and general podcast listening with a pair of second-generation AirPods Pros. With active noise cancellation and transparency mode, these AirPods can let you get totally absorbed in your music or let some noise through so you can be safe while out and about. They're water- and sweat-resistant so you can wear them in the rain or during a high-intensity jog. Best of all, they come with four different-sized silicone tips, only take an hour to charge and have up to 6 hours of playtime with active noise canceling. 
Heads up: These are priced higher than typical at Amazon right now, possibly due to low stock, so head over to Walmart for the current best deal at $100 off.
Promising review: ""Never thought this would be worth the cost, but way better than any other in-ear headphones."" — Quarter
If you live in the Apple ecosystem, you’ll be happy to know that Apple’s official 1-meter MagSafe Apple Watch charger is 45% off right now.
This 1-meter USB-C cord is snappy, fast and simple. The official Apple Watch MagSafe charger is a magnetic fast charger to USB-C cord, letting you place your Apple Watch on its back and wirelessly charge it. No-frills, sure, but it’s official, so you know it’ll work and work well. “The fact that it is magnetic gives you peace of mind,” explains one reviewer, “and you do not have to keep checking if the watch is making the right contact with the charger; it just snaps on and that’s it.” Bottom line: It’s convenient, reliable and all you need.
If you’re looking for a new screen to supplement your smartphone or laptop, good news: The latest iPad Mini is $100 off right now. And per the reviews, this baby’s features are worth it — from the AI upgrades to a jaw-dropping processor that make this the fastest iPad to date. “For this price, you can’t beat the power this thing has for the sheer size it comes in,” as one reviewer notes.
It’s a major upgrade from previous-gen iPad Minis and other larger iPads — all thanks to an A17 Pro chip. This adds the latest Apple Intelligence (AI) features to the operating system so it’ll perform tasks by studying your personalized data.
With the iPad’s AI power, you can effortlessly do things like reply to emails and messages, take notes, summarize texts and proofread before hitting send. You can also sift through photos, give your iPad a command prompt to clean up an image, and it’ll delete any distracting objects (or people) from your photo as if they were never there.
If you want a more recent version of the classic AirPod earbuds, then these updated pods are the ones. They offer personalized spatial audio, meaning you'll get immersive sound delivered to fit your unique ear shape, head movement and surroundings. Other new features include audio sharing so you can pair more than one set of AirPods in order to have the same listening experience, as well as Apple's new ""pinch-perfect"" feature that allows you to control your entertainment with just a quick motion of your fingers. Grab them with or without active noise cancelling. This is the lowest price we've ever seen for this model, so don't wait to get them at such a great discount.
Do you need a new workhorse of a laptop? This week's a good one to grab Apple's latest, ultra-fast 2025 MacBook Air with M4 chip. Released in March, the brand has discounted it at $240 off for Black Friday. This powerhouse laptop was built for high-powered work, which means it can accomplish tasks with elegance and ability that'll look nearly effortless — despite its performance being a modern feat. This model also comes with additional privacy protections that Apple calls groundbreaking, saying its intelligent encryption prevents anyone from accessing your data, supposedly including Apple itself.
It's available in four colors and with or without Apple Care, depending on your needs. Several reviewers also noted that it was super easy to use when transitioning from a Dell or Microsoft computer. Meanwhile, experienced Apple users also enjoy all its upgrades.
The Apple Watch SE 3 is up to 20% off right now, the lowest price it’s ever been. That’s a steal for a smartwatch that just released a few months ago. This sought-after piece of wearable tech syncs perfectly with your iPhone, tracks your workouts and health stats, and handles all the essentials with that signature Apple polish and a 32-hour battery life in low-power mode.
The watch has solid health features that set it apart from other smartwatches on the market: This includes temperature sensing, sleep tracking, cycle tracking with retrospective ovulation estimates, low and high heart rate notifications and more.
It also, of course, has several pre-loaded functions for sports and exercise, in addition to important safety features. You can send an SOS from your Apple Watch SE 3 with a simple hold of the watch’s crown. It can also detect when you’ve fallen, or even if you’ve made a collision, and alert proper services and loved ones pronto. Some reviewers say they’ve purchased an Apple Watch SE 3 for a loved one in their life as a preventative tool.
Apple's only over-the-ear headphones promise a dynamic and high-fidelity sound that the brand calls ""a breakthrough listening experience"" powered by their proprietary H1 chip. These headphones boast noise-canceling capabilities, along with a transparency mode for all those instances where you still want to interact with the world around you. Enjoy up to 20 hours of listening time per charge from the accompanying slim smartcase, along with other features such as audio spatial awareness.
Use the Apple Magic Keyboard Folio as a keyboard, trackpad and adjustable stand to take your iPad use to the next level. (Note that this one is designed for A16 and 10th generation iPads specifically.) It attaches magnetically to your iPad and doesn't need to be paired or charged, and folds up when not in use so you can take the keyboard on the go with you. If you prefer to use your iPad more like a laptop, or just to have that versatility to switch between tablet and computer, this is a purchase that can give you that best of both worlds.
You can never go wrong with an extra cable, right? If your cable's seen better days or you're always misplacing yours, then fix it all with the 1-meter (about 3 feet) Apple USB-C lightning cable on sale for 29% off list price.
Promising review: ""No shocker. It works. I tend to try and stick with Apple brand charging cables because I have had bad experiences with charging cables from other brand. They either break too easily or they eventually cause me to have charging issues, so I stick with Apple to keep from having any issues."" — Joshua
Perfect for runners, gym rats, hikers and anyone who loves data, this adventure-ready watch is made for going off-trail and underwater. The ""always on"" display makes it fully functional as a daily watch, with a battery that can go up to 72 hours, tracking everything from heart rate to cycling speed to high tide. It works as a fully functional GPS, so you'll never lose the trail. This is the lowest price we've ever seen for this watch, so we imagine the stock won't last.
Okay, this isn't the steepest discount, but it is the lowest price we've seen for the newest model of the AirPods Pro, so it's still worth checking out. These earbuds are perhaps known for their buzziest new feature of providing live translation in select languages, which can be hugely helpful for travel. That's in addition to a ton of other bells and whistles, including noise cancellation, heart rate sensing, a Hearing Aid feature and a battery life of up to 10 hours.
If you’re looking for a new screen to supplement your smartphone or laptop, good news: The 11th-generation iPad is under $300. Also known as the iPad A16, this is the latest generation of iPad, released on March 12, 2025. Reviewers love everything from its brilliant display to its jaw-dropping processor that makes it super speedy. “A solid accessory for your coffee table and small trips,” as one reviewer notes. “[A] solid piece of technology.”
The 11th-generation iPad is a major upgrade from previous-gen iPads, but just under the processing power of the iPad Pro and iPad Mini — all thanks to an A16 Pro chip. This chip adds speed to basic functions, though it’s notably the only iPad that doesn’t feature Apple Intelligence (AI). In other words, it will not perform tasks by studying your personalized data.
Promising review: ""I recently got accepted into school and didn’t want a laptop I wanted something that could do what a laptop does and more. Fresh out the box the iPad is a PURE BEAUTY ! i felt the excitement as i took the plastic off, it came in great condition, no visual damage from shopping. The iPad last all day long !

The iPad A-16 chip works very fast and processes everything I do very quickly! This iPad definitely exceeded my expectations and i am very pleased with this purchase!"" — Thee Baddie

I'm reminded of what the Benetton F1 team did when rules specifically prevented teams from using wheel speed and gear information to run traction control systems. Instead they used a combination of incoming air stream pressure (similar to how an aircraft's pitot-static system works) in combination with some preloaded per-event data and track position information to make another traction control system that did the same job.

So no actual punishment at all, just a promise to stop doing the most obviously illegal part?The company deserves to be liquidated and the all funds distributed to the renters they ripped off.
And no repayment to all the renters who have been gouged for years due to this price fixing, either.
And it's not like those rents are going to go back down
So no actual punishment at all, just a promise to stop doing the most obviously illegal part?The company deserves to be liquidated and the all funds distributed to the renters they ripped off.It's just a promise that is guaranteed to be violated.  Why?  Because the only reason for RealPage's existence is to help landlords set rents.  If non-public rent info cannot be used to set rents, RealPage has zero value and they would quickly go bankrupt.  The mere continuance of their existence strongly suggests that they are violating their promise.

Google’s parent company, Alphabet, is very close to becoming the fourth company to join the $4 trillion market cap club (current members to have crossed that threshold are Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia).
That’s thanks to a week of arguably great news for its AI efforts.
Fellow tech giant and significant Nvidia customer Meta is considering supplying some of its data centers with Google chips, according to The Information on Monday. The deal that’s potentially worth billions of dollars would start in 2027, the report claims, but Meta could also rent chips from Google Cloud as early as next year.
Preceding that piece of news was a flashy product reveal. Last week, the tech giant released its latest AI model, Gemini 3, and announced some updates to its viral image generator Nano Banana Pro, both to much fanfare.
According to The Verge, AI benchmarking firm LMArena’s co-founder and CTO, Wei-Lin Chiang, said that the release of Gemini 3 represents “more than a leaderboard shuffle.”
Right now, two companies are generally seen as leading the AI industry. You have OpenAI on the products side, whose ChatGPT has become almost synonymous with the word ‘AI chatbot’. On the hardware infrastructure side, you have Nvidia, the world’s number one supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) that are used to power AI.
But Google, a company that has plenty of money and resources to spend and institutional knowledge to take advantage of as a Silicon Valley veteran, seems well poised to give a good fight on both fronts.
Many people all over the internet, including Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, have claimed that Google’s Gemini 3 model is better than OpenAI’s ChatGPT by a significant degree.
From the outside looking in, OpenAI is still the leading name in AI chatbots for the time being. But, according to a New York Times report, the head of ChatGPT, Nick Turley, told employees in October that the company was facing “the greatest competitive pressure we’ve ever seen.”
On the AI chips front, Nvidia is still the confident frontrunner, but Google might score a big win in its catch-up efforts if The Information report is true.
Nvidia’s GPUs are the preferred AI chip right now, but Google’s custom tensor processing units (TPUs) are providing at least some competition.
While GPUs are considered versatile like Swiss Army knives with their flexibility to accommodate a broad range of tasks, Google’s TPUs are specialized and considered more efficient for specific AI workloads. TPUs are a type of application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). An industry expert told CNBC last week that he sees custom ASICs growing “faster than the GPU market over the next few years.”
On top of the GPUs it purchases from Nvidia, Google has been using its own TPUs to power its cloud computing business for several years now. The tech giant is also renting out its TPUs to AI companies like Anthropic, which then uses the chips for its chatbot Claude in tandem with Nvidia GPUs, as well as Amazon’s Trainium chips.
Meta would no doubt be a significant addition to that customer list, and could perhaps give Google’s custom chips business a more competitive edge in a market dominated by a behemoth.

SSDs are fast but their high cost-per-gigabyte makes them impractical for storing large quantities of data. For simple bulk storage where capacity is more important than ultra-fast transfer speeds, traditional HDDs still rule and Seagate just hit record low pricing across its lineup during Black Friday Week.
However most capacities sold out rapidly, with only the massive 22TB model still in stock at $229 instead of the usual $249, and way down from its $599 launch price that made early adopters wince. That works out to about one cent per gigabyte and it’s the best value cost-per-GB storage you can find right now on Amazon during Black Friday.
See at Amazon
The 22TB capacity gives you breathing room that smaller drives simply can’t match, letting you dump entire external drive collections onto a single unit instead of managing multiple devices with confusing labels. You can store roughly 4,400 hours of HD video, 5.5 million photos, or 440,000 music filesÂ which covers most people’s entire digital collection with space left over for years of future growth.
USB 3.0 connectivity delivers transfer speeds around 120-160MB/s depending on file typesÂ which means copying a 100GB folder takes about 10-15 minutes instead of the sub-minute transfers you’d get with an SSD. That speed difference matters less for archival storage where you’re moving files once and accessing them occasionally rather than working directly from the drive daily.
Plug-and-play design works straight out of the box with Windows and Mac computers, with no software installation or superfluous setup processes to waste your time. You just connect the USB cable, wait for your computer to recognize the drive, and start dragging files over like you would with any storage device. Included Rescue Data Recovery Services provide a safety net if the drive fails and offers professional data recovery attempts that normally cost hundreds or thousands of dollars separately.
The drive runs quietly during operation without the loud clicking and whirring that older external drives produced, though you’ll still hear some mechanical noise since spinning platters can’t match the silent operation of solid-state drives. Seagate’s build quality has improved over the years, with these expansion drives showing solid reliability ratings from users who’ve run them continuously for backup operations. The vertical orientation saves desk space compared to laying drives flat, and the simple black design blends into any workspace without drawing attention.
At $229 for 22TB of storage, you’re paying roughly a penny per gigabyte which is absolutely the floor for cost-effective bulk storage right now in this Black Friday window. The $20 discount from the recent $249 price adds up when you’re buying this much capacity, and compared to the insane $599 launch price, this deal feels like robbery in your favor.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang wants employees to use AI whenever they can — and he insists they shouldn't worry about losing their jobs in the process.
In an all-hands meeting on Thursday, the day after the chipmaker reported record earnings, Huang responded to a question about managers instructing employees to use AI less.
""My understanding is Nvidia has some managers who are telling their people to use less AI,"" he said at the meeting, which Business Insider listened to. ""Are you insane?""
Huang said he strongly disapproved.
""I want every task that is possible to be automated with artificial intelligence to be automated with artificial intelligence,"" he said. ""I promise you, you will have work to do.""
Nvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.
Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today.
Nvidia isn't alone, as tech giants have taken measures to push employees to incorporate more AI into their day-to-day work. Both Microsoft and Meta plan to evaluate employees based on their AI usage, and Google told engineers to use AI for coding, Business Insider reported. Amazon was in talks to adopt the AI coding assistant Cursor after employees requested it, according to Business Insider's reporting.
Huang also said Nvidia's software engineers use Cursor. And if AI does not work for a specific task, ""use it until it does,"" he added. ""Jump in and help make it better, because we have the power to do so.""
Though fear of job loss has been a constant drumbeat amid the rise of AI, Huang suggested Nvidia employees shouldn't worry. He said that while other tech companies have conducted layoffs, Nvidia had hired ""several thousand"" people last quarter, which he joked was putting a strain on office parking spaces. He added that hiring is still ramping up.
""Frankly, I think we're probably still about 10,000 short,"" Huang said, ""but the pace at which we hire should be consistent with the pace at which we can integrate and harmonize the new employees.""
Nvidia has significantly expanded its workforce, increasing from 29,600 employees at the end of fiscal 2024 to 36,000 employees at the end of fiscal 2025.
As Nvidia grows, its physical footprint is expanding. Huang said at the meeting that the company has recently moved into new offices in Taipei and Shanghai and is constructing two additional sites in the US.
Nvidia has become the world's most valuable company, with a market cap of over $4 trillion. The company reported last Wednesday that it generated $57.01 billion in revenue in the last quarter, up 62% from the same period last year.
Recently, investor Michael Burry of ""The Big Short"" has been taking aim at Nvidia, voicing skepticism about the AI boom. Nvidia pushed back on these criticisms in a memo to Wall Street analysts, Business Insider reported Monday.

The Snake Eater remake's Tactical Edition is bundled with a $15 DLC pack, and you can snag a copy for PS5 or Xbox for over 50% off.

 Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - Tactical Edition (PS5) 
 $30 (was $70) 
 Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - Tactical Edition (Xbox) 
 $30 (was $70) 
 
Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is on sale for an extremely low price during Walmart's Black Friday sale, and Amazon is matching the deals on PS5 and Xbox Series X. While supplies last, Metal Gear fans can grab the Tactical Edition for only $30 (was $70). The Tactical Edition includes a voucher with codes for the Sneaking DLC Pack ($15 value) and White Tuxedo Outfit. 
The massive $40 discount is by far the best price since the Snake Eater remake launched in late August. Before Walmart's sale started, the lowest price was $50 in Best Buy and Target's Black Friday sales. 
It's worth emphasizing that the Tactical Edition is technically a launch edition. At some point, whenever retailers sell through their inventories, the next batch of physical copies will likely be standard editions without the Sneaking DLC voucher in the box.
Sneaking DLC Pack:
The Sneaking DLC Pack comes with 10 cosmetic items, including suits that pay homage to Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, two ""naked"" uniforms, and even a suit that turns Snake into a crocodile. Here's the full list:
The voucher in the box has a separate code for the White Tuxedo, which was originally framed as a preorder bonus.
PC players can save 45% on the standard edition Steam key at GameSpot sister site Fanatical. The discount drops the price of Metal Gear Solid Delta to $38.49. Unfortunately, the Sneaking DLC Pack is only included with the Digital Deluxe Edition on PC, which is priced at $60 (was $80) right now.
 
If you're still interested in Metal Gear Solid Delta's Collector's Edition, Amazon has the PS5 version in stock for $173 (was $200). It's also in stock at Walmart and GameStop at full price. The Collector's Edition on Xbox is only available for $200 at Walmart.
 
The Snake Eater remake's Collector's Edition comes with a bunch of physical extras, including a Terrarium Diorama and exclusive steelbook case. The diorama recreates a scene from the game's first mission, and the steelbook has Yoji Shinkawa's artwork from the original Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. Here's everything you get with the Collector's Edition:
For more Metal Gear collectibles, take a look at GameStop's exclusive merch collection and the collection of silly rubber duck vinyl figures by Tubbz. And if you want to read more about the remake before you order a copy, check out our Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater review. We awarded the remake a 9/10. Solid Snake's return is extremely solid.

Comfy is a small biz!
Promising review: ""I bought this for my mom because she’s ALWAYS cold. She LOVES IT. The outside is soft and the inside is very plush and soft also. It’s got a nice weight to it. The pocket on the front is large enough to put just about anything in it. It’s large enough for a 2X-size man to wear comfortably. I will probably be buying these as gifts this year!"" —KMartShopper
Get it from Amazon for $43.29+ (available in 25 styles).
Promising review: ""When I first saw this, I immediately thought it was completely ridiculous. But it kept popping up in my periphery, and one day, after seeing it on YouTube, I bought it on impulse, along with a page-turner. And so glad I did! It is so easy to clip in your Kindle and twist/extend it into the perfect angle, and the bowl is a great spot to stash my page-turner, earbuds, etc. Paired with the page turner, it's a total game changer, you can get cozy under blankets and not even have to move your hands, which is significantly more comfortable for bedtime reading (and safer — who else has dropped a Kindle on their face??). I am very nearsighted, and it's easy to tuck the pillow in and angle the Kindle close to my face. I also like using it just in my lap, where I can elevate the Kindle and avoid neck and wrist strain on those long reading sessions! I don't even feel embarrassed when my husband makes fun of it; it's that good :P If you love your Kindle, you will love this pillow!"" —J Thornberg

Promising reviews: ""What a difference this makes. I'm usually TikTok-ing while in bed, and have my phone on a stand. Not having to raise my hand to scroll up or down is amazing!"" —Phons S
""I use this just to scroll while reading on my iPad. It allows me to curl up in the blankets while I have my iPad in a holder. (It may be lazy, but I’m obsessed all the same.) Super comfortable to hold/wear around your finger. It was easy to connect with my iPad and definitely worth the money in my opinion."" —Mandi Arnold

Promising review: ""I love this couch cup holder tray. I made a small, portable office in my bedroom. I often work from the bed so I can keep my feet raised to prevent my ankles from swelling. I put the couch cup holder tray on the bed next to me, and keep the TV remote, my tablet, my drink, and other items in it for easy access. I have moved all over to see if the tray would tip, but no tipping occurred. (Note: I have a firm memory foam mattress.) It is sturdy, easy to clean, and doesn’t tip over when you move around. Because of its size, you can use it anywhere… like on the couch, or when you are outside sunbathing or working on the deck/porch. It is a good buy for the price!"" —Amazon Customer

Promising review: ""I've had the ugly plate-style candle warmers before and they don't even come close to this one. This one gives off the nicest glow, and the different styles are so pretty. I love that it has a timer feature and I feel much safer having this instead of lit candles. This would make a great gift for anyone. I will definitely be buying more for other rooms."" —Catherine Vorce

It’s perfect for unwinding after a long day — I don’t have to overthink it, just grab my markers and relax. The designs are cheerful and always put me in a better mood. Definitely one of my favorite cozy coloring books!"" —Jeffrey Jones

Promising review: ""I had neck and shoulder pain for about a month, that’s why I bought this, and after using this massager just 4–5 times, my pain went away!! I was afraid it would be painful, as I can be sensitive when getting a massage, but it was not at all painful. The cord is nice and long, you can put it on your neck, back, feet, everywhere! And it feels so good. If I get a kink in my neck or my feet hurt I take this out! Best purchase ever!"" —Sarah E.

Promising reviews: ""The fur-fleece lining is a game changer. It provides a level of coziness that turns these mini boots into a warm hug for your feet. The plush lining extends to the entire interior, ensuring that every step feels like walking on clouds. It's the perfect remedy for chilly days and cold floors."" —Amanda Root

Promising review: ""I've debated about buying the Ugg Ultra Mini boots for a while now, but didn't want to spend $140 on them. I came across these boots and figured I'd give them a shot since they were HALF THE PRICE! I'm so happy I went with them. The quality is amazing, and the lining is so soft and cozy. I wear a 9.5 but ordered the next size up so I can wear them with thicker socks in the winter. So comfy and easy to walk in."" —Alexandra

Promising review: ""I originally bought this tray to prep pizza ingredients to make the pizza assembly process easier with lots of people involved. It worked like a charm. But then, I decided I could also use it to prep and store fruits and veggies in the fridge. MY FAMILY NOW SNACKS ON FRUITS AND VEGGIES! Game changer. Seriously, having ready-to-eat healthy snacks has made a big difference in our house. And the items stay fresh way longer than other storage I’ve used in the past. It’s also easy to bring out at meal time without extra work. It does clean in the dishwasher, but cups always turn over. I recommend hand cleaning the lid too, as one of mine started to twist a little, but it is still very usable. I like that they stack well in a French door fridge, which is a space saver. Overall, great product, should last a while. Excellent value, as now I don’t throw out old fruit and veggies as much. Highly recommend. Sous chef’s kiss."" —CL

Promising review: ""Firstly, this heater puts out a tremendous amount of heat. I got this for a room that doesn't have a door, so I didn't expect it to heat the space that well. Surprisingly, this heater not only makes the entire space comfy, but the adjacent hall to the room manages to get warm as well. It's also incredibly quiet. It's the quietest heater I've had, and it's also so sleek. It looks high-tech while not requiring a lot of space or tech know-how. Plug it in and either push power on the remote or power on the actual device, and you're ready to go. It has three modes, and yes, I can tell the difference between low and high heat output."" —L. Thornhill

Promising review: ""Okay, this dog bed is the best thing I've ever purchased for my home. My dogs love it, I love it, we all fit on it!! Also took it to the drive-in movie theater, and it was the coziest thing, might consider taking it on a one-night camping trip lol. But seriously, it is huge. My dog is 120 pounds, and as you can see, it fits three of us plus room for more. Already taken naps on it with my dogs as well! One year later — Still loving this dog bed! I have really enjoyed how easy the bed is to clean and also that I was able to downsize it — I moved into a different space and wasn’t needing it to be as huge as when I originally bought it, I removed half of the stuffing and folded the other half of the fabric underneath and it now serves as a great under the window bed!"" —Emily Macey

Here's what BuzzFeeder Heather Braga has to say:
""After reading about how much reviewers loved this product (and including it in my articles for years), I was so excited to finally try it out myself. I wasn't disappointed! It's a little louder than I thought it would be (as the air compresses in and out to relieve tension), but once I put music on with it, I didn't notice the noise anymore. I've been using it to relax my eyes after a long day of working on screens *and* parenting. I also break it out when I have sinus pain, and it's been really helpful in easing that pain. Consider me a fan!""
Promising review: ""I saw this product on one of Amazon’s must-have TikTok videos, and I knew I had to get it. It was so worth it — even though the price may seem higher compared to other sellers, this is for sure a good investment piece. The quality is top-notch, the strap that goes around your head is comfortable, and most importantly, the duration of each mode is long enough that it doesn’t interrupt your rest. I work a 12-hour night shift as a nurse, and this technology has helped me get through the night easily.👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽"" —Amazon Customer

Promising review: ""This is such a great Kindle! It’s lightweight, the perfect size for going in a purse or bag, and the matcha is SUCH a great color. I already have a Paperwhite SE that I love, so I decided to get this Kindle for travel purposes. The battery life isn’t as great as my Paperwhite, but it still lasts me a while with daily reading! It fits perfectly in my hands and makes reading very comfortable. The only thing it is missing is the warm light option, but that is not a deal breaker for me. If you are looking for a lightweight and comfortable Kindle, this is the one for you."" —Christine Heath

Lulu Candles is a US-based small business that specializes in scented candles and perfumes. 
Promising review: ""This is such a great candle that fills the room quickly with a really nice, strong smell that is soothing and relaxing. I was looking for a less expensive Le Labo Santal 33 scent candle, and this one is very, very close! It's a bit stronger, but I love it! The shipment arrived fast, and I just love how fast it fills up the room without being lit for so long!"" —Cristina Bertolotto

It has three heat levels, a 45-minute auto-off timer, and overheat protection to protect your toes. 
Promising review: ""My feet were always so cold under my desk and I couldn't get a space heater because I was worried my PC tower would overheat. This foot warmer feels heavenly! It warms up instantly, turns off after 45 minutes, but stays pretty warm for a bit after. It's very soft and comfy. takes up very little space. I have a little footstool under my desk, and this fits on top easily. I wish I had gotten it sooner. Highly recommend!!"" —DT

Promising review: ""I like how this diffuser kind of looks like a mini fireplace, and it’s perfect for winter. I also like how long the water of this diffuser lasts — I always add my favorite essential oil in it when I go to sleep every night without worrying it will run out of water. I used to have insomnia, and it helped me to sleep through the night with my relaxing essential oil scent, and it also worked as a humidifier."" —Benny

Promising review: ""Love this very stylish set of remote control–operated candles. They cast a lovely amber glow with a very subtle flicker, very lifelike. I chose the gray tone 'glass' jar, which is actually a very lightweight plastic, so I'm not worried that it will break if tipped over. They make a charming addition to my living room.

However, I’m pleased to report that it has held up beautifully so far. The jar is lightweight and shows no signs of cracking, which is a relief.

If you keep catching weird whiffs or glimpses of spots in your house you totally forgot you have to clean, welcome to the club — those out-of-sight zones love to ambush all of us. Below, we've got easy, fast fixes that can help you handle all of the “I’ll get to it later” grime.

Promising review: ""According to the instructions, I was supposed to use the whole bottle, but being that it was so big and that I had two toilets to clean, I only used half. I was pleasantly surprised. The toilet tank is from the 1960s, and I doubt it's been cleaned within the last few decades. In the 'after' photo (above), you can see that there is still some rust left over, but large chunks fell off the sides and can be seen on the bottom of the tank."" —Nicole

Promising review: ""I’ll admit, I was pretty skeptical when I first bought this product. After months of battling with a stubborn sink that just wouldn’t drain, I had tried everything — and I mean everything — short of calling a plumber. I decided to give Yugou a shot as my last-ditch 'Hail Mary,' and I’m so glad I did! Not only was it incredibly easy to use, but it also worked effectively. I couldn’t believe it. The sink is now flowing and draining better than it ever has before, and dare I say... it was even kind of fun to use! Bonus: It has a lovely, fresh scent that leaves the bathroom smelling great. I’ll definitely be buying more of this magic in a bottle once I’ve finished this review, as it’s also perfect for preventative maintenance. Highly recommend!"" —Janet Anders

Promising review: ""WOW!!! This stuff is incredible! I work in an environment that is very dirty and our office is always covered in a fine layer of dust. But just a few minutes spent mashing this slime into all the cracks and crevices of my keyboard, mouse, phone, etc. and it's all clean as can be! This stuff picks up dirt on contact and leaves behind a clean, no-smell, no-residue surface. I bought a second jar for my vehicle and it works miracles in there as well.

Slip a single tablet in your detergent tray (or in the bottom of the dishwasher if it won't fit in there) and set it to a regular wash cycle. After it's finished, open it up to find limescale, hard water stains, and other mineral buildup completely wiped out. 
Promising review: ""I had tried lots of white vinegar for two cycles in my 20-year-old dishwasher for the cloudy and powdery dinginess it had started showing and it only helped about 30%. We have very hard water. This zapped the buildup, and the glass is clear again, and colored plastics no longer have the powder-like coating. So glad I took a chance on this!"" —J. Holden

Promising review: ""So, I bought this originally for my son, who gets really bad allergies to dust. At first, we didn't know what was causing this until someone told me to check our beds and furniture. Even though we change our bed sheets regularly, dust will still be left over. So I decided to give this a try, and they were right! I couldn't believe how many mites and how much dust there was. I took my time cleaning everyone's bed and our sofa, and it was easy to use and light. My son hasn't had a reaction in a while, which means this product works for my family!"" —Lisa

Promising review: ""OK, I'll be honest, I ordered this because of the price. After reviewing several other options and having been disappointed with previous dusters I've had, I figured, why spend more money on something that isn't going to work? So I ordered the least expensive option, but WOW does this little tool rock!!!! It's very easy to use and clean.

The microfiber dusting head is completely removable and machine-washable.
Promising review: ""This sucker is LOOOONG. It's also short when you need it to be. But its length is one of its greatest assets, being able to reach even those ceiling beams you couldn't reach before. Finally reach the tops of picture frames that are hanging in awkwardly high places. Clean off the poles that extend the drop of the ceiling fans. Dust the corner speakers mounted on the ceiling. This is what I did in no time at all with this duster, and despite nearly two years of web buildup in some high places, I got the whole job done in just a few minutes. Seriously, you can wipe down all the webs that have been built — all without standing directly beneath the duster! The extra length also means no unexpected guests are going to drop down your shirt while you're evicting them. And I'm perfectly okay with that."" —M. C. Payette

Promising review: ""This is an amazing set of brushes. Don't be fooled by the low cost. The brushes are soft and long enough to get into tight spots, but firm enough to hold up. They work amazingly in those hard-to-clean aluminum window runners and sliding doors. I've used them to clean in enclosed fan blades, refrigerator vents, etc. They wash easily, and with a bit of TLC, they hold their shape. Always nice to find something so simple and inexpensive that works so well."" —CNJ

Most definitely — many brands that specialize in cashmere rarely ever have sales. This luxury fabric is great to stock up ahead of winter since it's naturally insulating and easily giftable.
As we've addressed in our guide to the best cashmere sweaters, it costs more to produce a cashmere sweater due to the laborious brushing and spinning process. After all, it can take the hair of approximately 4-5 fully grown cashmere goats to make a single sweater.
Quince has the most affordable, adequate cashmere, but it's usually excluded from Black Friday sales. Naadam is a bit more expensive, but softer than Quince's and currently on sale for 40% off. For mid-range luxury cashmere, we also recommend Lilysilk for its subtle designs and lightweight cashmere sweats.

HorrorHorsesSanta RagioneSteam 
Horses is an upcoming narrative-driven horror game you’ve probably never heard of set to launch next month on the Epic Games Store, Humble Store, GOG, and Itch.io. But you won’t be able to find the creepy indie title on Steam, and the Italian studio behind Horses claims it doesn’t know why Valve is blocking the game from its PC storefront.
On November 25, indie studio Santa Ragione published a trailer for Horses that revealed the game’s December 2 release date. However, it also sports an interesting badge at the end claiming the game has been banned from Steam. At the same time the trailer went live, the studio updated its website to include a lengthy FAQ about Horses being banned from Steam. It claims Valve has provided little clarity on what’s going on and that the whole situation could result in developer Santa Ragione, which made 2023’s excellent Saturnalia, shutting down entirely.
Speaking with IGN, co-founder Pietro Righi Riva explained that in 2023, the studio submitted a request for a Steam Coming Soon page for Horses. However, Valve told the company to submit a playable build. “We were only about halfway through development and had scrambled together a build that could be played start to finish, solely to satisfy Steamâs request for a playable version to open a Coming Soon page, something we had never been asked for before,” Riva said. According to the studio, this is when Valve rejected Horses from being sold on Steam.
But Santa Ragione was not told why Horses had been banned from Steam. The company’s FAQ claims Steam told the studio that Horses had been barred from the storefront because it found that it featured “themes, imagery, or descriptions that [Steam] won’t distribute.” The message also included a line that Valve won’t distribute games that contain content depicting “sexual conduct involving a minor” regardless of intention or if it is done in a “subtle way that could be defined as a ‘grey area.'”
The studio called this explanation “deliberately vague and unfounded” and claimed that Horses does not contain any content that would fall into this so-called “grey area.” However, it did admit that initially a scenario in the game did involve a young kid riding on the shoulders of a naked woman in a mask, as horses in the game are depicted as naked people, but that scene has since been changed to remove the child.
“Steamâs decision came without detailed feedback, and the ban notice did not cite any specific scenes or elements,” Riva told IGN. “For months, we repeatedly asked what triggered the ban and received no answer. We also offered, unsuccessfully, to change any content deemed unfit, especially since the game was still early in development at the time of submission.”
Kotaku contacted Valve, but didn’t hear back before publication.
According to Santa Ragione, this ban has nothing to do with the ongoing and recent issues involving alleged pornographic games being removed from Steam due to bad-faith actors pressuring credit card companies and payment processors.
Santa Ragione claims that Horses not being able to launch on Steam could make it very difficult for the company to recoup development costs, and the studio admits that it might shut down in the near future. The developer has set aside funds to support Horses for around six months after launch, but beyond that, it is unsure of what the future holds, as being banned from Steam will keep Horses away from “more than 75 percent of the PC gaming market.”Â 
Horses launches on basically every other PC gaming storefront besides Steam on December 4. It will cost $5.

Music truly comes to life when you experience it with a high-quality pair of headphones. One of the best in the market today is Sonyâs flagship noise-canceling model, the WH-1000XM5. Known for their exceptional sound and comfort, these headphones offer a premium listening experience thatâs hard to match. Currently, theyâre available at a great price as one of Amazonâs early Black Friday deals, with discount of $62 off. Normally priced at $460, the platinum silver, black, and midnight blue versions are now reduced by 13%, bringing them down to just $398.
I must applaud Sony on what they’ve done here. When we look at the naming schemes for Sony’s competitors in the space, we find products like the Apple AirPods Max or the Samsung Galaxy Buds. These catchy, memorable names tie in neatly with their companies’ broader product lineups.
Then we have Sony. This brand decided to go with the WH-1000XM6. This assortment of letters and numbers give little indication they represent a pair noise-cancelling wireless headphones aside from the WH. This is less a product name and more an internal SKU number, and I find that just beautiful. These headphones don’t need some flashy name. The headphones speak for themselves.

A standout feature of the WH-1000XM6 is their exceptional noise-canceling capabilities. Sony has designed these headphones with advanced processors and twelve microphones that work together to detect and counteract external sounds. This advanced noise-canceling technology creates a completely immersive listening experience, allowing you to enjoy your music, podcast, or audiobook without the distractions of the outside world.
The noise cancellation is especially noticeable (or maybe unnoticeable?) during phone calls. Thanks to the built-in microphones, your voice is isolated and amplifiedâeven in noisy environments. Whether you’re in a crowded cafÃ© or a busy office, the person on the other end of the call will hear you clearly, with no background noise to disrupt the conversation.





In terms of comfort, the WH-1000XM6 excels. The headphones are wrapped in soft, synthetic leather, making them feel plush and comfortable against your ears, even during extended listening sessions. Theyâre lightweight too, which means you can wear them for hours without feeling fatigued. In fact, with an impressive 30-hour battery life, you can listen to music or take calls throughout the day without worrying about recharging. And if you do forget to charge them, donât stress. A quick three-minute charge will give you an additional three hours of playbackâenough to get you through the rest of your commute or the next leg of your journey.
Whether you’re a music lover, a podcast enthusiast, or someone who just wants to enjoy a quiet moment in a noisy world, these headphones are an excellent choice. With the current discounts of $62 off, there’s no better time to grab a pair of the Sony WH-1000XM6 headphones and experience their next-level audio quality.

88,2025-11-25,"Valve reportedly concerned about apparent depictions of ""sexual conduct involving a minor""

Saturnalia and Wheels of Aurelia developers Santa Ragione have announced that they will ""wind down operations and face a high risk of closing the studio"", following Valve's refusal to allow their upcoming horror game Horses on Steam, PC gaming's largest digital storefront by some distance. They say they have the funds to support and update Horses after launch for around six months, but claim they ""will not be able to start new projects unless Horses somehow recoups its development costs without access to more than 75% of the PC gaming market"".


The studio have published a FAQ on their official website explaining the situation in depth. They claim that Valve rejected Horses based on an unfinished build from 2023, at which time Steam's approval teams commented that ""this title features themes, imagery, or descriptions that we won't distribute"", with the specific addition that ""we will not distribute content that appears, in our judgment, to depict sexual conduct involving a minor"".


We'll return to that last line. Firstly, some context. Horses, if you've yet to have the displeasure, is an unholy cauldron of surreal body horror and silent cinema techniques, now due to release via Epic, GOG, the Humble Store and Itch on 2nd December. It casts you as a young man who must spend two weeks working on an isolated farm. After meeting the Farmer - a lumpen gargoyle whose lips and teeth get far too much screentime - you're introduced to the titular Horses, who turn out to be naked human slaves in horse masks, their private parts blurred out.


Around two years ago, Santa Ragione submitted a ""rough, incomplete"" version of Horses for Steam approval. ""We were only about halfway through development and had scrambled together a build that could be played start to finish, solely to satisfy Steam's request for a playable version to open a Coming Soon page, something we had never been asked for before,"" the developers comment. 


Santa Ragione say they received an ""automated"" review statement from Valve in June 2023, rejecting the game on the grounds that it infringed Steam's content policies. Find it in full below.


After review, we will not be able to ship your game HORSES on Steam. While we strive to ship most titles submitted to us, we found that this title features themes, imagery, or descriptions that we won't distribute. Regardless of a developer's intentions with their product, we will not distribute content that appears, in our judgment, to depict sexual conduct involving a minor. While every product submitted is unique, if your product features this representation--even in a subtle way that could be defined as a 'grey area'--it will be rejected by Steam. For instance, setting your game in a high school but declaring your characters are of legal age would fall into that category and be banned. This app has been banned and cannot be reused. Re-submissions of this app, even with modifications, will not be accepted.


The developers spent the following months asking for more details about the ban, while offering to change anything Valve deemed unfit for publication - something that would have been relatively straightforward, given that Horses was still being made at the time of Steam review submission. They say that Valve have yet to reply, but they believe Steam's content reviewers may have had misgivings about one particular scene when another man and his daughter visit the farm. 


""The daughter wants to ride one of the horses (in the game the ""horses"" are humans wearing a horse mask) and gets to pick which one,"" the developers explain. ""What followed was an interactive dialogue sequence where the player is leading, by a lead as if they were a horse, a naked adult woman with a young girl on her shoulders. 


""The scene is not sexual in any way, but it is possible that the juxtaposition is what triggered the flag,"" they continue. ""We have since changed the character in the scene to be a twenty-something woman, both to avoid the juxtaposition and more importantly because the dialogue delivered in that scene, which deals with the societal structure in the world of HORSES, works much better when delivered by an older character."" 


The developers note that all characters in the game ""are clearly older than 20 years old, as communicated by their appearance and through dialogue and documents that you will encounter in the game."" They also comment that while Horses ""does contain some sexual elements, the intent is never to arouse. It uses challenging, unconventional material to encourage discussion."" Valve have, of course, already rejected the argument from intent in their alleged statement above.


I've now played through Horses myself - look out for a review next week - and as regards the final version of the game, at least, nothing about the scene with the young woman strikes me as some kind of child pornography. It's disturbing material, but it's also very clearly a commentary on abuse and exploitation rather than an endorsement, with appropriate dialogue, and yes, the characters are depicted as adults (the young man protagonist is elsewhere described as 19 or 20 in a letter from his parents). Still, it's not clear that this is the scene that has triggered Valve's ire. We've mailed them to ask for comment on Santa Ragione's claims.


Santa Ragione say they have invested around $100,000 making Horses. The developers invested $50,000 initially after signing the game with its primary developer, Andrea Lucco Borlera, and had hoped to cover the remaining costs based on sales of their previous, very good horror game Saturnalia. The latter has not sold as well as hoped, however, something Santa Ragione attribute partly to Valve's refusal to give them Steam keys for a ""great bundle opportunity"" - this came around the time they were told that Horses had been banned from Steam. 


Santa Ragione say that the ban has ""completely erased our ability to find an external supporting publisher or partner to fund the rest of the game, as no one in the industry considers an indie game that cannot be released on Steam to be viable"". They have raised the remaining $50,000 via private funding from friends, ""which puts us in a completely unsustainable financial situation unless the game somehow recoups its development costs"". 


Santa Ragione perhaps merit some criticism on this last count - if you know that your videogame project is not ""viable"", isn't it more responsible to hedge your bets rather than continuing to raise funds? Still, I'm sympathetic to the developers' predicament otherwise.


Given that it dates back to 2023, the Horses ban pre-dates the recent swathe of ""adult"" game delistings on Steam and Itch.io precipitated by a payment processor crackdown. In their FAQ, Santa Ragione are careful to draw lines between the situation and wider efforts to restrict access to sexual material online.


""It's important to note that HORSES' ban has nothing to do with the recent restriction on adult content pushed by payment processors,"" they write. ""This decision was solely in the hands of Steam's curatorial team."" In other words, they're putting the blame for all this squarely on Valve. 


""Alongside ultraviolent titles, Steam distributes explicit pornographic games,"" the developers comment. ""[S]ome of these listings acknowledge the legal grey area Steam mentioned in the HORSES ban message, by stating 'All characters depicted are over the age of 18' in their store descriptions, and yet non-pornographic works like HORSES can be banned without context. 


""By contrast, mature works with comparable or stronger themes routinely appear on mainstream streaming platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, where controversial directors are an accepted part of the catalog,"" the developers go on. ""This double standard suggests Steam does not treat games as art on par with film, and intervenes with censorship when an artistic vision does not align with what the platform owner considers acceptable art.""


Again, we'll ask Valve for a comment.

Update: And here it is. Valve have shared a statement with RPS and other outlets about how Horses came to be blocked from Steam. It doesn't really add to Santa Ragione's account of events, or offer any insight on why the game was rejected, but it does suggest that the developers had planned to release Horses considerably earlier than this December, which you could read as contradicting Santa Ragione's comment about submitting a ""rough, incomplete"" build from ""halfway through development"" for platform holder review in 2023. Still, I'm peering at tea leaves there. Here's the statement in full.

Alibaba’s latest earnings report shows the Chinese tech megacap leaning hard into the two engines that management believes will define its future — namely, ""instant commerce"" and AI. And those bets are starting to pay off.
For the quarter ended September 30, Alibaba reported 15% revenue growth over last year, excluding its divested retail operations — making for one of its strongest showings in recent memory. The company credited growth in consumer activity and its expansion into one-hour delivery,  a much-contested battleground where China’s biggest retailers are slashing prices and pouring money into logistics to win market share.
The company said revenue from its instant commerce businesses grew about 60%, driven by one-hour and same-day fulfillment services that draw users into Taobao’s broader ecosystem and function to boost frequent, repeat purchases. 
Granted, this strategy is pretty expensive — adjusted earnings for Alibaba’s China commerce division fell sharply versus the 2024 numbers — but the company said the unit economics have “substantially improved” recently, with efficiency increasing and order values rising, too. 
It’s primarily Alibaba’s other pillar — cloud computing. 
Revenue at Alibaba Cloud grew 34%, on the back of demand for AI infrastructure and  workloads driving eye-watering triple-digit growth in AI products. External cloud revenue climbed 29%, and the company is also gaining traction with its model ""family,"" Qwen, which now boasts more than 180,000 derivative models on Hugging Face, a central marketplace for open-source AI. The analyst firm Omdia estimates Alibaba holds about 36% of China’s AI cloud market, which puts the company well ahead of domestic rivals.
Alibaba’s international commerce also passed a milestone, with its overseas division reporting 10% revenue growth and posting a profit.
Alibaba stock jumped 5% on Monday alongside the larger tech rally — one of the steepest rallies of 2025 thus far, and one which saw the Nasdaq rocket nearly 3% in a single day. 
Alibaba shares rose another 3% heading into Tuesday’s market open. "
90,2025-11-25,"It happens to the best of us: You pick up a new fitness routine and it starts off great. You feel stronger and more energized. Then, it stalls. What gives? 
First, you need to ensure your routine follows the principles of progressive overload and includes heavy weights. The next step is looking at your habits outside of the gym, like supplementation. 
Certain supplements can help you power through workouts, build (and tone) muscle, and support recovery—so you can get the most out of your next sweat session.* And mindbodygreen has you covered with the best science-backed solutions.
But this year, don’t wait for January first to get started. Take advantage of our best sale of the year to start upgrading your supplement stack: save up to 60% on subscriptions or up to 20% off one-time purchases with code BFCM20. Plus, get a FREE gift on orders over $200. 
Ready to make a change? These are the supplements that can help you build strength and push past the dreaded plateau.* 
If your goal is to get stronger this year, then adding creatine to your daily routine should be a must. A (very) comprehensive review of creatine supplementation and women's health1 concluded that supplementation is beneficial at every life stage with very little risk.* 
mindbodygreen’s creatine with taurine+ provides an effective 5-gram dose of creatine monohydrate with 2 grams of the amino acid taurine (also benefical for muscle and brain health).* It comes in unflavored, raspberry, and watermelon. Women have been loving it to push past plateaus at the gym and sculpt their muscles.*
For creatine and hydration support, try creatine with electrolytes+.

Many protein powders are known for a chalky texture and artificial taste. Not mindbodygreen’s grass-fed whey protein isolate+. Its ingredient label reads like a baked good, which means the formula mixes well into oatmeal, smoothies, chia pudding, and even plain water or milk. 
One serving has an impressive 25 grams of protein per serving with an ideal amount of BCAAs (including leucine), so you can more easily hit your daily protein goals, support muscle health, and balance blood sugar.*  
Amino acids, especially essential amino acids, are key to fueling muscle protein synthesis—the body’s processes for building and repairing muscle. lean & tone aminos+ offers pure, free essential and branched-chain amino acids that are absorbed quickly into the bloodstream.* Helpful before, during, or right after a workout, they pair perfectly with protein.
This powdered supplement combines readily absorbable (and gentle on the stomach) magnesium with 100% tart cherry powder. The duo helps relax your nerves and muscles (bye-bye tension). While magnesium supplements have been shown to improve performance and fitness while helping to reduce muscle soreness2, tart cherry powder provides key polyphenols that help calm oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways (supporting speedier muscle tissue repair post-exercise).*
Yes, vitamin D is crucial for muscle health and overall lean mass. Hear me out. It helps your muscles contract efficiently, supports protein synthesis, and influences fast-twitch fibers that are key for strength and power.* 
Low levels have been linked to reduced performance, slower recovery, and difficulty building or maintaining lean mass. And vitamin D plays an important role in mood balance, which is crucial as we head into the winter blues season. mindbodygreen’s vitamin D3 potency+ is optimized for absorption and can help raise stubbornly low levels.* 
We've only covered a few of mindbodygreens supplements+ above, but there are more than a dozen supplements you can mix and match. Just don’t forget to use code BFCM20 at checkout to save.

After procrastinating to buy my flight home for Thanksgiving one too many times (sorry, Mom), I've been left with no other option but to turn to the Pennsylvanian, a 9-hour and 20-minute Amtrak train that travels from New York to Pittsburgh.
This time, I paid $316 for the round-trip ticket, and was happy to book the train instead of a flight. I've taken this train ride almost a dozen times in the past five years, and have turned into somewhat of a train enthusiast because of it.
Additionally, flying disruptions — such as the recent government shutdown — and the seemingly endless construction at my hometown airport have made me more inclined to take the train over the past few years.
It's not perfect, but from avoiding never-ending security lines at the airport to having a row to myself, here are the four reasons I prefer traveling by train.
I've been stranded in too many hour-plus airport security lines to count. When I arrive at the train station, I simply wait for my track to be announced, which typically occurs 15 minutes before departure, and then board the train when it arrives.
There aren't any annoying security lines or shuttles to take between terminals, so I can get to the train station around 30 minutes before the train leaves. Plus, boarding usually goes pretty fast because the train attendants can stagger the boarding lines between train cars.
Have you ever shed a tear watching TSA throw away a precious perfume or hand lotion you just bought?
One of the lovely things about traveling by train is that there are no size restrictions on liquids. This is a small win, but when I fly, I'm constantly holding my breath to see if my carry-on toiletry bag will make it through TSA, so it's another tick on the pros list for me.
Additionally, Amtrak has a really generous luggage policy. Each passenger is allowed one personal item, two carry-ons, and two checked bags free of charge. Additional checked luggage is only $20 a bag.
With no assigned seats, there's usually an opportunity for me to find a row to myself. I've taken this train route five times in the last year, and there's only been one ride where I wasn't able to snag that luxury.
There's a roughly two-to-four-hour period of the train ride where I lose cell service entirely, and I use that time as a deep work block to get writing, planning, or anything else that I need to get done accomplished. 
One benefit of having a row to myself, besides the obvious extra room, is that I can spread out my work in front of me and not worry about bothering anyone.
Lastly, it's a scenic ride. Although I try to focus on getting some work done or taking stock of my priorities, both personally and professionally, I sometimes can't help but get lost in the views for hours.
My favorite part of the ride is about halfway through, when we go on the horseshoe curve in Altoona, PA. It's a 220-degree railroad curve that was finished in 1854. I've now seen the curve through almost every season and look forward to marveling at the view each time.
As much as I do love the train, the ride itself isn't always the smoothest, the café car never has consistent hours, and sometimes, by hour six, the 9-hour ride feels like it will never end.
But overall, if I have the time to spare, I'll always choose the train over flying. I've realized that having this time for myself helps me reset in between destinations.

    The music streaming service will reportedly raise prices again after subscription rate hikes in other regions.
  
Spotify has bumped prices for US customers twice in the last two years and is expected to do again in early 2026.
After announcing it is raising prices in regions including Europe, South Asia and Latin America, Spotify is reportedly about to increase prices again in the US.
The US is included in the latest Spotify price hike on its Premium services starting in early 2026, according to the Financial Times, which cited sources familiar with the music streaming company's dealings. For now, the least expensive Premium plans in the US start at $12, but the price hike would likely put it in line with the other regions, where the Premium plan costs about $14 a month.

Spotify also offers a Premium Family plan that covers six people in the same household for $20 and plans for students ($6 a month bundled with Hulu) and couples ($17 a month). Spotify also offers a Basic plan that doesn't include access to audiobooks for $11 a month. A representative for Spotify did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
If the report is accurate, this would be the third price increase on Premium plans in the US since 2023. Before those hikes, Premium plans were $10, but Spotify raised its minimum price by $1 in 2023, then again in 2024.
Just this week, Spotify added the ability to seamlessly import playlists from other music services including Apple Music and Tidal.
Spotify has faced some controversy this year, including some music acts abandoning the platform and some customers canceling subscriptions over advertising for Homeland Security's ICE program. CNET has a guide for canceling your Spotify subscription.
If Spotify's price increases have caused customers to jump ship, it doesn't seem to be reflected in the service's subscription numbers. According to Statista, Spotify is still adding Premium subscribers worldwide, growing to 276 million in the second quarter of 2025 from 246 million the year before. 
The company is the market leader among music streaming apps, with about 32% market share as of the end of 2024, according to Statista.
But even in its dominance, Spotify may have some concerns about customers' reactions to its pricing, and has been making its increases gradually.
""The 2023 price raise was arguably overdue, and Spotify waited too long in part because they tend to be really shy of bad press,"" said Wren Graves, managing editor of music publication Consequence. ""Spotify is now incrementally getting back to a more realistic market price without trying to spook the market, like the Fed signaling rate cuts.""
Graves said competitors, including Apple Music and Tidal, have been priced lower than Spotify and that the increase could prompt them to increase their rates as well. It could also benefit musicians, depending on labels.
""This could lead to more money in artists' pockets, though the labels will still have the biggest say in how the pie gets divided,"" Graves says.
Given Spotify's continued growth, it appears many are putting a premium, so to speak, on what Spotify offers and accepting the price increases in the US and other markets.
""Subscribers value access and convenience enough to absorb modest price hikes, proving the strength of the brand and the appeal of a premium, personalized experience,"" says Shoshana Winter, CEO of Converge Marketing."

Bluetooth speakers fill a niche spot in the audio market, and deciding whether you really need one can be tricky. The best ones are noticeably better than listening to music straight from your Android phone, but usually worse than premium earbuds or headphones. Forget putting portable Bluetooth speakers up against dedicated in-home audio setups, because they'll lose every single time.
So, is there a reason to buy high-priced Bluetooth speakers, such as the Bose SoundLink Micro 2? This speaker, and those in its category, are inherently limited by their size. The Bose SoundLink Micro 2's footprint is a four-inch square, and while larger than its predecessor, it can only fit a small 5W audio driver as a result. Volume won't be competitive with larger speakers, but that isn't a dealbreaker for me.
Instead, I've appreciated that Bose valued clarity and depth over pure loudness, because it helps the SoundLink Micro 2 sound better than most competitors in its size class. The high $129 retail price is steep for something of this caliber, but there's a certain kind of music listener who will love it. Oh, and it's already on sale for Black Friday, only a few months post-launch.
Bose SoundLink Micro 2: was $129.00 now $109.00 at Best Buy
Bose's SoundLink Micro 2 is still tiny, but packs a bigger punch. It has a 12-hour battery life, IP67 protection, and a built-in strap. The SoundLink Micro 2 comes with Bose's strong bass while supporting the Bose app for EQ adjustments on the fly. 
Price check: $109.00 at Bose
 



The sound quality is an important part of any speaker, but for something like the Bose SoundLink Micro 2, portability and durability loom large. This speaker handles both eloquently. The speaker's body is covered in a tough rubber that protects the shiny metal speaker grille underneath. While there are oversights, like no plug for the USB-C port, the SoundLink Micro 2 earns an IP67 water- and dust-resistance rating.
That IP67 certification means the SoundLink Micro 2 can handle submersion in up to one meter of water at normal pressure for half an hour, at least when it leaves the factory. We wouldn't recommend using it in the water, but it should survive beach or pool duty just fine. Those are near-perfect applications for the SoundLink Micro 2 — vacations, hikes, parties, and pool days are all great uses for a wireless speaker this durable.
However, I'd be wary of sand, as there are a lot of places for particles to get trapped, even if the internals are dustproof.
 



It has a built-in strap that's luckily user-replaceable and removable. This is arguably the SoundLink Micro 2's best feature. It's perfect for securing the speaker to a bag or a set of handlebars, and it'd make a great addition to a bike or scooter setup. At just 320 grams, it's a lightweight option.
Compared to the inbuilt carabiner found on the JBL Clip 5, I'd say Bose's implementation is better. You can still slide your own carabiner into the SoundLink Micro 2 strap, but the JBL Clip 5 can't be secured as well as the Bose speaker.
Volume isn't a strength of any speaker in this size class, but the level of detail and depth you get from the Bose SoundLink Micro 2 is impressive. It sounds best when you listen head-on, and you'll hear a surprising amount of bass considering the small form factor. There isn't the annoying distortion you hear at high volumes, either. It's clear that you get what you pay for with the SoundLink Micro 2 — it's slightly louder than competitors but way better-sounding.
 



I do have a few complaints, starting with the strap. It's almost perfect, but I wish it were a bit longer so you can strap the Bose SoundLink Micro 2 to more things. As a runner, I strangely wish I could just strap it to my arm for group workouts. Or, perhaps a longer strap could be used to attach the SoundLink Micro 2 to a water bottle — the possibilities are endless. Unfortunately, none of these use cases is possible with the current length.
Bose also chose to remove the microphone from the Bose SoundLink Micro 2 (the original SoundLink Micro had one). This isn't an issue at all for me, and it probably won't be for you, unless you use your Bluetooth speaker for two-way calls. I'm sure there are some people out there who do, and the SoundLink Micro 2 won't work.
 



There aren't many times I'd use the Bose SoundLink Micro 2 in place of my other audio products, but it's the best option when durability, water-resistance, and portability are top of mind. Anyone looking for a small but mighty portable speaker for pool or beach trips will enjoy the SoundLink Micro 2, and the same goes for bikers and e-scooter commuters. It's on the expensive side, but I think you get what you pay for in terms of sound quality.
If you're on the fence about which Bose SoundLink speaker to get, we have a complete Black Friday buying guide to help you make your choice.
