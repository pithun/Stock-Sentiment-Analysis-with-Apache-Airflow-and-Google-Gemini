5,2025-11-24,"Almost everything is on hiatus. The EU AI Act, Digital Services Act, and Digital Markets Act are all at risk. The European Commission is preparing to end the year with virtually no movement on its most important tech policy initiatives. Many measures may even be reversed.
In particular, a series of changes threatens to weaken the entire framework of the EU AI Act by eroding its substance. There could also be major reconsiderations of the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act. Not to mention the Digital Networks Act and the EU Space Act, before they even see the light of day, are already the subject of legal disputes. Since the tariff agreement between the United States and Europe was signed last August, big tech companies, backed by the Trump administration, have increased pressure to soften restrictions on all fronts.
Europe's landmark artificial intelligence law went into effect in August 2024, but the deadline for full implementation is set for August 2027, with an important intermediate milestone in 2026. According to the Financial Times, the first review of possible amendments could take place toward the end of 2026 as part of a broader Digital Omnibus package, which aims to simplify guidelines.
At a daily press briefing on November 7, Thomas Regnier, the spokesman for the European Commission for Digital Sovereignty, acknowledged mounting concerns. “A lot is happening in the field of artificial intelligence. Standards are lagging. There are concerns from industry and member states,"" he said. “In this context, we have a ‘digital omnibus’ coming, and that would be the appropriate framework to address some of these concerns. But no decision has been made yet.”
The most significant change would involve postponing by one year—from August 2026 to August 2027—the application of penalties for violations of the new rules in order to “grant sufficient time for providers and users of AI systems to comply.”
The Digital Networks Act had been promised by the end of the year, but the EU Commission is stalling. The act won't be discussed again until late January 2026, assuming an agreement can be reached. There are too many differences of opinion among member states, particularly on two issues: shutting down copper networks and strengthening BEREC, the European regulatory authority.
On the issue of shutting down copper networks, Germany reportedly said no to the proposed 2030 deadline, which it considered too soon. Regarding the strengthening of BEREC, many national authorities have balked, citing differences in market conditions as their official rationale. In reality, the pushback is likely due to fears of losing influence and power in their respective countries. In short, the single telecom market project is slipping away. The revision of net neutrality rules has disappeared from the version of the Digital Networks Act currently being worked on, while the initiative to rebalance market conditions between telecoms and big tech companies is ill-defined.
The United States has officially spoken out against the EU Space Act, declaring Europe’s proposal unacceptable as it would hinder American companies by restricting their scope of operations. In a 13-page document responding to the public consultation launched in July by the European Commission, the US State Department listed all the sections that would need to be revised for Europe to avoid retaliation for failing to meet the commitments made in the framework agreement on tariffs. “The current draft of the EU Space Act contradicts the spirit of the agreement,” the State Department wrote flatly, calling on Europe to “allow for smoother cooperation with the U.S. government and industry rather than introduce additional barriers to cooperation.”
The European Commission continues to send letters to American tech giants calling on them to comply with the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Digital Markets Act (DMA). But with a barrage of appeals from the parties involved, timelines are becoming extremely drawn out.
Apple and Google have sharply criticized the DMA in recent weeks, underscoring how strained the negotiations with Europe are becoming. Last August, the Federal Trade Commission warned that certain DSA rules might conflict with American laws, particularly regarding freedom of expression and the security of United States citizens.
The US State Department reportedly lobbied on behalf of the Wi-Fi industry, which includes major American companies like Apple, Broadcom, Cisco, and Qualcomm, to protect a specific band of the mobile spectrum. According to the MLex news outlet, the Radio Spectrum Policy Group (RSPG), which assists the European Commission in developing radio spectrum policy, has proposed a compromise on the use of the upper 6-GHz band in favor of the mobile phone industry.
The US State Department reportedly urged member states to reserve nearly half of the band for Wi-Fi services, specifically for high-speed, low-latency applications such as virtual reality and cloud gaming. According to MLex, 13 out of 27 countries sided with the mobile operators, while the others abstained. In any case, EU countries can change the policy, since the RSPG only issues recommendations, not binding decisions. For a final decision, the ball is in the European Commission's court.

Gen Z is graduating into a labor market reshaped by AI pilots, hiring freezes, and jittery managers.
That doesn't mean a jobs cliff is imminent, said James Ransom, a research fellow at University College London, who studies the impact of AI on work.
But it does mean the rules of entry into the job market are changing fast — and the smartest move isn't to chase prestigious titles, he said, but to understand the tasks inside those jobs, then show how you can supervise and scale AI to do them more effectively.
""I do think in the short term there's a potential productivity dividend, or a windfall that people need to be trying to grab,"" Ransom told Business Insider.
""That doesn't mean that you just wholeheartedly embrace AI for the sake of it. It does mean critically looking at what it might do — particularly things where a human is still needed in the loop, but they might be able to be supercharged in what they do,"" he said.
Ransom's thinking builds on research from global institutions, including the IMF, OECD, and the World Bank, which have mapped automation risk by breaking jobs into their component tasks.
Ramson specifically pointed to an International Labour Organization report released in May.
It found that few jobs are fully automatable, since most include tasks that require human input — a nuance Ramson said is often lost when people label entire jobs as either secure or doomed.
""You look at these indices and, you might say, 'Okay there's a job here, senior accountant, where eight out of nine tasks are potentially exposed,'"" he said.
""However, when you start to look closely, you see that the ninth one that's not exposed is managing a team and quality checking. That's pretty indispensable, so that doesn't mean this one is necessarily at risk,"" he said, clarifying that this is a hypothetical example.
Ransom said the key for Gen Z is to demonstrate AI fluency.
""Your typical organization does not have people who understand what an LLM is, what its strengths or limitations are,"" he said.
He said that for younger workers, this era favors those who can show their skills through measurable impact.
""Particularly where you can point to actual gains or time savings,"" he said.
""Whether it's X number of outputs that you achieved or time saved, accuracy, and how then that can be replicated — where you've got a playbook,"" he added.
Ransom sees the present AI rollout as a brief window of opportunity before the real disruption begins.
Companies are still in an ""augmentation"" phase, he said, where people can use AI to boost productivity — but that could eventually give way to ""a crunch"" as automation matures and headcounts shrink.
He compared it to the ATM era, when banks initially hired more staff before reducing their workforce once the technology took hold.
The same cycle, he said, may now be unfolding across white-collar industries: firms hire to experiment, expand, then trim the excess.
The pace of that shift, he added, will be uneven, hitting local labor markets and industries at different speeds.
Even as he studies automation risk, Ransom rejects both utopian and dystopian narratives.
""I certainly don't think we're heading towards a tech utopia where everyone lives happily ever after,"" he said. ""I also don't think we're heading towards imminent superintelligence.""
He expects the ""human-in-the-loop"" era — where a human checks and guides AI — to probably last three to five years, with oversight, judgment, and persuasion remaining indispensable.
""To safeguard yourself, do the things that AI can't,"" he said. ""Particularly things that involve interaction, social skills, leadership, oversight of things, and being able to use AI to solve problems.""

Coinbase is betting big on fixing one of crypto’s oldest headaches: the initial coin offerings (ICOs) that fueled the 2017 boom and left a trail of rug pulls in their wake. However, the exchangeâs latest acquisition has illustrated some of the underlying issues that still plague this aspect of the crypto market.
Coinbase has agreed to snatch up Vector, which is a Solana-based trading platform cooked up by the team behind the Tensor NFT marketplace. The deal is intended to improve Coinbaseâs integration with Solana, and the exchange described Vector as a platform that âgives traders access to one of the most active, high-velocity trading ecosystems in crypto.â
At the core of both controversies associated with this latest acquisition announcement by Coinbase is the TNSR token, which is associated with the team behind Vector.
For one, observers see obvious insider trading around the announcement, with suspicious buys piling into TNSR right before the news hit. The TNSR price surged from around $0.04 to over $0.30 in the days prior to the announcement of the deal. And this was at a time when the crypto market was doing poorly more generally, with bitcoin dropping below $90,000.
Additionally, Coinbase grabbed the Vector tech and the team behind it but left TNSR token holders out of the deal. Whether practical or not, TNSR holders assumed they would benefit from this sort of acquisition, according to Messari research analyst Sam Ruskin.
@DefiSolar Thanks, we're aware of this and investigating + will take any necessary action based on our findings
— aklil (@_aklil0) November 21, 2025

 
Coinbase isn’t pretending it didn’t notice the price action. The exchange is digging into the trades and price movement that took place prior to the announcement, a probe that dredges up ghosts from its own insider trading scandal, where an employee got slapped with federal charges for leaking token listing plans to his brother.
“We’re aware of this and investigating + will take any necessary action based on our findings,” Head of Corporate Development Aklil Ibssa wrote on X.
Coinbaseâs agreement to acquire Vector brings up existential questions around what crypto market participants are really purchasing when they buy these sorts of tokens. There are many instances where crypto projects have both a token and a formalized company with shareholders associated with it, and the legal ambiguity around what crypto tokens actually represent can leave those holding crypto instead of equity out in the cold.
âTNSR token holders just had their best asset stripped and got ~$0 in return,â said Dragonfly Partner Omar Kanji. âIf this continues, people will just stop buying tokens.â
The lack of true connection between crypto tokens and the projects and development teams associated with them has been an area of dispute since cryptoâs earliest days, and the lack of ownership over anything real has made some wonder if the more technically-innovative aspects of crypto arenât much different from the often-mocked memecoins.
harder for Coinbase to sell their new ICO platform when they set the precedent of tokenholders getting rugged on CB's own acquisitions
as an active buyer of ICO launches rn, it gives me more questions DDing ICO tokens from them vs other platforms that walk the walk themselves https://t.co/1t4owXOmpg
— Jon Charbonneau ðºð¸ (@jon_charb) November 21, 2025

 
Notably, this controversy popped up at the same time Coinbase was undertaking the first token offering associated with their new launchpad, which they say is intended to avoid many of the issues and outright fraud associated with the previous ICO bubble of 2017. For many, the Vector deal does not bode well for Coinbaseâs reputation as a fair platform for such token launches.
âHarder for Coinbase to sell their new ICO platform when they set the precedent of tokenholders getting rugged on CB’s own acquisitions,â Jon Charbonneau, who is a co-founder of crypto investment firm DBA, posted on X.
At the same time, Coinbase is also looking at potentially launching their own crypto token for its Base network, which operates as a layer-two Ethereum network protocol, even though the platform is functioning well today without a token.
Would it be rude ask why most of you were buying project tokens in the first place?

Of course, how much blame can be placed on token creators if people are willing to purchase these assets that donât have much clarity in terms of what exactly is being purchased or if there is any real use case?
âFunny that crypto waged a war on securities laws and now is about to learn most of them exist to prevent investors from getting ripped off,â said NYU Professor Austin Campbell.

The Trump family fortune has plummeted by a billion dollars in just a few months due to losses in the volatile cryptocurrency market.
Analysis by Bloomberg News found that President Donald Trump and his family’s venture into meme coins and cryptocurrency has dragged their collective wealth down from an estimated $7.7 billion in early September to $6.7 billion.
This includes a Trump-branded memecoin losing around one quarter of its value since August, the president’s son Eric’s Bitcoin mining venture shedding roughly half its value from its peak, and shares in Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG)—which owns Truth Social—falling to all-time lows after the company invested heavily in crypto.
Not only have the Trumps lost heavily in their crypto ventures, but anyone who hoped to get rich by investing in the Trump name is also hemorrhaging money. Investors who bought Trump’s meme coin at its peak in January, for example, would have lost almost the entire value of their investment by November.
The massive downturn in the Trump family’s wealth coincided with a period of particular turmoil in the crypto market, during which around $1 trillion in value was wiped out.
Last week, bitcoin, the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency, tumbled below $82,000 for the first time since mid-April. This marks a 32 percent drop from bitcoin’s all-time high of $126,000, recorded in October, reported Fortune. 
The fact remains, however, that Trump and his family’s move into cryptocurrency and NFTs has still been enormously lucrative overall, boosting their wealth by billions, especially since the president returned to office. In September, the Wall Street Journal estimated that cryptocurrency had overtaken the Trump family’s real estate portfolio as their most valuable asset.
That analysis came as World Liberty Financial, a Trump-backed crypto venture, began trading on multiple exchanges, earning the family around $5 billion. However, Bloomberg now reports that the value of the Trump family’s holdings of WLFI tokens has fallen to around $3.15 billion, down from a $6 billion peak. This drop is not included in the overall wealth decline, as the coins are locked and cannot be traded.
Shares in TMTG fell to an all-time low on Wednesday, months after the company spent about $2 billion on Bitcoin and other securities, including options, according to Bloomberg. President Trump’s stake in TMTG has fallen by roughly $800 million since September.
TMTG also invested heavily in CRO, a coin issued by the Singapore-based crypto exchange Crypto.com. In September, TMTG’s investment in the CRO token was worth around $147 million, but it is now worth roughly half that amount.
Another Trump-linked crypto venture has also cratered. Shares of American Bitcoin Corporation, in which Eric Trump owns a 7.5 percent stake, have plunged by more than half since September, wiping out more than $300 million from the family fortune. An investor who bought shares when the company went public would now be facing a 45 percent loss.
Eric Trump has downplayed the family’s massive crypto losses and insists the downturn represents a “great buying opportunity” for investors.
“People who buy dips and embrace volatility will be the ultimate winners. I have never been more bullish on the future of cryptocurrency and the modernization of the financial system,” he told Bloomberg.

A well-known Polish market analyst has publicly apologized after his latest Bitcoin outlook collapsed within weeks, sparking debate across social media.
Robert Ruszała, known online as El Profesor, admitted his plan was wrong and published a detailed breakdown explaining the mistakes behind his failed scenario.
Crypto commentators often highlight their wins and stay silent when predictions miss. Ruszała took the opposite approach.
He originally released a forecast called “The Plan,” outlining a bullish path for Bitcoin based on market fractals, the 50-week EMA, and a seasonal move often described as the “Santa Rally.”
According to his model, Bitcoin was expected to hold its uptrend and provide opportunities to take long positions at specific technical levels.
However, it took the market only three weeks to dismiss that vision. Bitcoin dropped below key zones and invalidated the entire bullish structure.
On 21 November, Ruszała addressed the failed call directly, writing:“I failed… I’m sorry to everyone who followed this plan. I know where I made the mistake.”
He later explained that he always prepares two scenarios — bullish and bearish. The first one worked from roughly $116,000 down to $94,700. The deeper decline activated his bearish outlook.
He stressed that reacting to market changes matters more than sticking to a single direction.
Ruszała then published a technical breakdown of the error. He pointed to several indicators that he ranked incorrectly in terms of probability.
That mis-ordering, he said, led him to misjudge Bitcoin’s potential movement.
The post did not spark major controversy, but it prompted discussion among traders. Several users praised him for his transparency, noting that few analysts publicly dissect their own mistakes.
His response highlights a broader reality in crypto markets: even well-constructed scenarios require constant revision, and the market can still surprise the most seasoned experts.

Then your back starts to ache after years of sitting in a crappy seat, and you start to wonder. Do what I did and invest in a supportive, comfortable, and ergonomic office chair. While the market is more competitive than ever, Herman Miller still makes some of the best in the business, and it just so happens that there's a sale on two of my favorites: the Aeron and Embody.
The Aeron is enjoying a 30 percent off flash sale from now through November 26; everything else at Herman Miller is 25 percent off for Black Friday. If you need a new chair for your home office, now's one of the best times of the year to snag it. For more deals, check out our Best Early Black Friday Deals roundup.

The Aeron is the most iconic office chair in the world, found in offices across the world, for good reason. This all-mesh design is excellent for airflow, and you'll find every adjustment imaginable to make this chair support your body. (Read more about my experience here.) You'll be faced with several options when purchasing, all of which influence the price, so let's run through them:
Herman Miller says there's free shipping on all orders over $1,500. Just remember that the 30 percent off sale price exclusive to the Aeron expires on November 26.

While the Aeron may be more familiar to many, my personal favorite is the Herman Miller Embody. It may take a week or two to get used to its flat and thin seat, but to me, it feels like a palate cleanser after I'm done testing other office chairs. It just feels right, with an excellent back support system and adjustable seat depth that surprisingly works for my 6'4"" frame. There are far fewer selections you have to make for the Embody, but the toughest choice is whether to go with Sync or Medley upholstery. Sync is softer and thicker, whereas the Medley feels a bit more textured, rougher, and taut.
These are just two of Herman Miller's office chairs, but there are tons of other options—including the gaming versions of the Embody and Aeron—not to mention desks, lighting, and other furniture. Perhaps it's time to finally consider springing for the classic Eames?

Michael Burry of ""The Big Short"" fame has pivoted from investing to writing, launching a paywalled Substack called ""Cassandra Unchained.""
Burry says the blog, which has amassed more than 23,000 subscribers since it went live on Sunday night, is now his ""sole focus."" It promises a ""front row seat to his analytical efforts and projections for stocks, markets, and bubbles, often with an eye to history and its remarkably timeless patterns.""
On his ""About"" page, Burry says he ""left the hedge fund business"" after 25 years to ""focus on what I've always loved: writing and sharing investment ideas.""
He writes that managing clients' money came with restrictions that ""muzzled"" him, meaning he could only share ""cryptic fragments"" publicly, whereas now he is ""unchained.""
The newsletter costs $39 a month, or $379 annually. By comparison, Citrini Research — the most popular newsletter in Substack's finance category — charges $125 a month, or $999 a year.
Burry has published two initial posts, one titled ""Foundations: My 1999 (and part of 2000)"" and the other titled ""The Cardinal Sign of a Bubble: Supply-Side Gluttony.""
The former recalls his time as a neurology resident at Stanford University Hospital, where he wrote about value investing at night.
""As I devote myself to Cassandra Unchained, I find myself on an old road not taken,"" it reads. ""I feel lucky, and I am grateful for the opportunity as I walk it again.""
The second post aims straight at the heart of the AI boom, which he calls a ""glorious folly"" that will require investigation over several posts to break down.
Burry goes on to address a common argument about the difference between the dot-com bubble and AI boom — that the tech companies leading the charge 25 years ago were largely unprofitable, while the current crop are money-printing machines.
At the turn of this century, Burry writes, the Nasdaq was driven by ""highly profitable large caps, among which were the so-called 'Four Horsemen' of the era — Microsoft, Intel, Dell, and Cisco.""
He writes that a key issue with the dot-com bubble was ""catastrophically overbuilt supply and nowhere near enough demand,"" before adding that it's ""just not so different this time, try as so many might do to make it so.""
Burry calls out the ""five public horsemen of today's AI boom — Microsoft, Google, Meta, Amazon and Oracle"" along with ""several adolescent startups"" including Sam Altman's OpenAI.
Those companies have pledged to invest well over $1 trillion into microchips, data centers, and other infrastructure over the next few years to power an AI revolution. They've forecasted enormous growth, exciting investors and igniting their stock prices.
Shares of Nvidia, a key supplier of AI microchips, have surged 12-fold since the start of 2023, making it the world's most valuable public company with a $4.4 trillion market capitalization.
""And once again there is a Cisco at the center of it all, with the picks and shovels for all and the expansive vision to go with it,"" Burry writes, after noting the internet-networking giant's stock plunged by over 75% during the dot-com crash. ""Its name is Nvidia.""
Burry finished that post with a quote from Buffett's late business partner, Charlie Munger: ""If you go around popping a lot of balloons, you are not going to be the most popular fellow in the room.""
Burry has launched his blog at a time of intense public attention on him.
Once a prolific predictor of crashes and recessions, he published his first post on X in more than two years on October 30. It suggested he had diagnosed the AI boom as a bubble and determined the ""only winning move is not to play.""
In subsequent X posts, he called out ""give-and-take deals"" among AI companies, warned they were overinvesting, and accused them of dragging out depreciation to inflate their earnings.
His Scion Asset Management disclosed in a November 3 regulatory filing that on September 30, it held bearish put options on Nvidia and Palantir with a combined notional value of $1.1 billion.
Palantir stock had hit a record high ahead of its earnings on the same day as Scion's disclosure, but has fallen 26% since then. In a televised interview on November 4, CEO Alex Karp lashed out at Burry's bets, calling them ""batshit crazy.""
Burry fired back that Karp ""couldn't crack a 13F"" and later posted that Scion had exited its Palantir puts in October. He terminated Scion's SEC registration days later, closing his hedge fund to outside cash.
The market veteran foreshadowed his Substack debut by sharing charts and text excerpts on X from his launch post about AI, hinting he was on to ""much better things,"" and teasing in his bio that ""Cassandra Unleashed"" was coming on November 25 or sooner.

The ""Cassandra"" moniker is a reference to the priestess from Greek mythology who was cursed to speak true prophecies but never to be believed.
Testifying to Congress after the financial crisis, Warren Buffett described Burry and another prescient investor, John Paulson, as ""Cassandras"" for predicting the housing crash that sparked the systemic meltdown.
Burry's massive wager made him famous after it was chronicled in the book and movie ""The Big Short."" Instead of betting against the market this time, he's poised to break down what's happening and share his in-depth research with his subscribers.

We here in America have become a nation of dip-buyers. Yes, we will throw our weight behind a sell-off now and then. But recent history speaks for itself: We will then look for a reason — any excuse at all — to buy back in.
But there has to be a reason. A lot of the time, it doesn't have to be particularly compelling. Just enough to form a narrative. Markets are an event-driven business, and there are usually enough new developments to keep the gears moving for investors.
Therein lies the problem with the upcoming calendar: there don't seem to be a lot of market-moving events on the horizon.
As of now, the next big thing is a Fed meeting, when we'll find out whether another rate cut is coming. But that decision isn't until Dec. 10. We're staring into a 2 1/2-week abyss of catalyst-lite trading.
Based on how the market has moved recently, that time lapse might be a bad thing, and last Thursday was a great example of why.
Nvidia smashed earnings in every conceivable way and gave the AI sector a big shot in the arm. Then, about two hours later, it all evaporated. What made it especially unnerving was that it happened for seemingly no exact reason, and that it was one of the most vicious reversals in market history.
There was speculation of traders having to bail out underwater bitcoin positions by selling stocks. There was also the (much-delayed) September jobs report, which was strong enough to throw a December rate cut into question. But the timing didn't line up perfectly for any specific explanation. It felt like a vibes-driven, ""sell first, ask questions later"" sell-off.
With sentiment able to flip on a dime like that — and with ""valuation concerns"" serving as a vague catch-all rationale for selling in tech — it's not super promising that investors will have a long stretch of time to sit alone with their thoughts.
Of course, the market works in mysterious ways, and dominant catalysts will emerge that we're just not seeing at the moment. Here are a couple possibilities for what that could look like:
Fed officials put themselves out there more — If Friday's session showed us anything, it's that comments from one central bank official can move the market. Anything remotely dovish would send stocks higher. Like I said, dip-buyers are looking for any shred of a reason
If you're a company looking to buck a broad market sell-off, might I suggest having Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway buy a significant stake? Or maybe you can release a new AI model?
Alphabet checked both of these boxes last week, resulting in 3% moves on each of those days and a more than 8% increase overall.

                Drinks with THC derived from hemp are sold in dozens of states, including ones that ban the sale of cannabis products. But  a recently passed  law promises to tighten controls on hemp, potentially hobbling the booming THC beverage sector.

It's Friday afternoon at Total Wine and More in Arlington, Va., and the shelves are sparkling with shiny bottles and cans. They include an option that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago: drinks containing THC instead of alcohol, in more than 30 flavors and varieties.
With names like Mountain High, Buzzin' Breeze and Citrus Bliss, most of the drinks have only low doses of THC, the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis. Because their THC is derived from hemp, the drinks are legal — for now (see below). Priced at $5 to $7 a can, some are fruit-flavored seltzers while others mimic cocktails.
""This one is the Mary Jane Mule,"" says Nathan Wilkinson, as he puts a can in his shopping basket. ""So that's kind of clever, but it's a Moscow mule. It tastes like ginger beer, you can have it with a little bit of lime and put it on ice.""

Wilkinson, who's in his late 40s, says he's been increasingly mindful about his alcohol intake. A few weeks ago, he decided to try a THC drink, as a non-alcoholic option that also promises a bit of relaxation. Today, he's buying a few beers along with THC drinks.
""I have never used weed, so this is sort of a nice entry point for me,"" Wilkinson says. ""I wouldn't have normally tried this, but because of the way it's being marketed, I'm up for it.""
The transaction is unremarkable except for a key detail: Virginia law forbids the sale of cannabis products. But selling THC drinks is legal in dozens of states if the active ingredient comes from hemp, as defined by the Farm Bill of 2018, creating legal cover that spawned a new market.
That market is buzzing, but that boom may come crashing down soon, thanks to a new law. When Congress recently approved a spending bill ending the government shutdown, it also set a one-year deadline to close the hemp loophole, with new restrictions. The move threatens the broader hemp market — estimated to be worth tens of billions of dollars — with what one economist calls ""an extinction-level event.""
THC drinks first appeared on the counters of gas stations and corner shops. But with more Americans like Wilkinson seeking alternatives to alcohol, they've gone mainstream in places like Total Wine; Target recently started selling them at stores in Minnesota.
""It has been a complete explosion of demand,"" says Tanner Johnson, CEO of Pure Shenandoah, a THC and hemp company based near Harrisonburg, Va. The family-run business got into THC beverages a few years ago; Johnson says the company's distribution deal with Total Wine took things to a new level.
""Since we got with them, we've basically seen a double of revenue every month,"" he says.
Johnson says Pure Shenandoah's current challenge is canning enough drinks to keep up with customers' thirst.
All of this was enabled by the easing of laws regulating hemp.

                Justin Garcia is chief marketing officer of SunMed Growers in Maryland, whose company works in the state's regulated cannabis market.

Despite U.S. policy distinctions, hemp and marijuana are cultivars of the same plant, Cannabis sativa L. Under the 2018 Farm Bill, if a plant contains no more than 0.3% of Delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol or THC, the compound that gives users a buzzy high, it's considered hemp.
As a result, hemp-derived THC products can be shipped from state to state and sold where local laws allow. Compare that to cannabis plants that have higher levels of THC and are classified as a Schedule I drug, alongside heroin. They remain subject to onerous federal restrictions, including a ban against interstate trade.
Strong customer demand and the ability to operate as legitimate businesses drove the hemp-derived THC drinks industry to mature rapidly, says Christopher Lackner, founder and president of the Hemp Beverage Alliance, a trade association.
Producers who started out driving their drinks to market personally are now shipping them in semitrucks, he says.
""These are not small operations doing mom-and-pop stuff out of their shed in their backyard,"" Lackner says. ""These are factories. These are people with 250 employees.""
The THC beverage sector blossomed into a billion-dollar industry. But Johnson says the looming federal changes are already affecting business in his state.
""We've seen big-box brands like Food Lion and Giant and Circle K, which were all pretty close to moving forward in Virginia, either pause or fully pump the brakes,"" he says.
The meteoric growth of THC drinks crystallized a revelation for the cannabis industry: A sizable segment of U.S. consumers wants access to legal, low-dose THC.
Hemp-based drinks ""introduced a whole new tier of folks that enjoyed THC"" but prefer to visit a neighborhood store rather than a dispensary, says Terry Mendez, CEO of Safe Harbor Financial, which provides banking services in the cannabis industry.

""The model that you saw [emerge] for intoxicating hemp was similar to alcohol and beer,"" he says, describing the grab-and-go option as ""much more consumer friendly"" than visiting a dispensary.
While THC drinks are available in some states with regulated recreational markets, they're also easily found in states that don't, such as Florida and South Carolina. To help customers navigate the offerings, stores like Total Wine post signs recommending new THC drinkers start with low-strength options from 2 to 4 mg, rather than cans holding 5 or 10 mg. At the Virginia store, a note reads: ""Onset as soon as 20 minutes.""
Justin Garcia, chief marketing officer of SunMed Growers in Maryland, a company that works in the state's regulated cannabis market, wants to see THC drinks remain on liquor store shelves — but only if hemp producers meet the rigorous standards states require of legal cannabis companies.
""We think that this drink thing is huge,"" he says. ""I think it's how the next wave of consumers enters the cannabis space. You know, smoking is never really going to be perceived to be healthy, but drinking an adult beverage is something that people can wrap their minds around a little bit easier.""
As of September, THC beverages were legal in 28 states and legal with restrictions in another nine, according to Whitney Economics, an industry consulting firm. Six states have banned them, the group says, while seven others require the drinks to be sold in marijuana stores.

                Attendees of the Cannabis Capital & Policy Summit chat with each other in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 17. The summit came a week after Congress passed a provision banning products that contain hemp-based THC.

The contentious vote in Congress to tighten rules on hemp came after dozens of state attorneys general issued a letter warning of the risks of an unregulated hemp THC market, and the dangers it could pose to children.
The restrictions were a hot topic for investors and entrepreneurs at the Cannabis Capital & Policy Summit, held last week in Washington, D.C. Speakers repeatedly noted that the hemp industry is on a countdown to find a way to survive. They included Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, who told an audience, ""This is not a partisan issue"" — and pointed to his vote alongside Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who opposes the hemp crackdown.

Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., has introduced a bill to repeal the section of the spending measure that restricts hemp. But citing the confusing patchwork of cannabis laws in the U.S., many at the conference called for going further.
Kraig Fox, a media and cannabis industry veteran and founder of U-Bet Advisory, says the goal is to reach ""a fair compromise to allow people to enjoy these products in a way that's safe for human consumption, that's age-gated, that children won't get their hands on them.""

                ""It's a crazy world right now,"" says Roz McCarthy, CEO of Black Buddha Cannabis, citing the looming restrictions. ""I believe in hemp. It's a beautiful plant. It has a lot of minor cannabinoids that help us with brain injury, that helps us with individuals that are dealing with HIV and cancer.""

Possible federal measures could include standardizing tests and monitoring of hemp products and requiring an ID check at liquor stores selling THC drinks.
Before the hemp rollback, many in the industry were anticipating a possible rescheduling of cannabis as a less harmful drug — a prospect President Trump said was under consideration in August. The timing of such a move would bring even more changes to the cannabis sector.
Despite uncertainty over how federal laws might change, the hemp THC beverage market continues barreling along. Lackner, of the Hemp Beverage Alliance, says that after news of the federal clampdown emerged, a drink supplier in the alliance told him that they called their distributor in Georgia to confer about what it might mean for them. The conversation was short, Lackner says.
""They said, 'Yeah, we heard about it. We need 24 pallets of your product shipped straight away.'""

21,2025-11-24,"Apple's online store has sold out of the limited-edition Hikawa Phone Grip and Stand accessibility accessory it debuted late last week. However, two new color options in production are set to be released in early December and can be pre-ordered directly from Hikawa's website.
Hikawa is offering the MagSafe-compatible Grip and Stand in Cobalt and Blurple Swirl, following the rapid sellout of its Chartreuse and Crater colors. The accessories cost £55 each (about $72 USD) and international shipping is available – but stock is extremely limited, so move quickly if you're interested.
Designed by LA-based Bailey Hikawa to celebrate the 40th anniversary of accessibility at Apple, the grip uses magnets to securely snap onto any iPhone with MagSafe. Hikawa says it can be removed with ease, and doubles as a stand with two different viewing angles, in both vertical and horizontal orientations.
Inspired by modern sculpture, the Hikawa's design process involved direct input from individuals with disabilities affecting muscle strength, dexterity, and hand control. 
The Hikawa website also sells a range of unconventional high-end iPhone cases, as well as a selection of eye-catching toilet seats.

24,2025-11-24,"Some people are not merely satisfied with functionality, or even just good looks. These persnickety snoots (I am one of them) seek something elegant, a true marriage of form and function.
Image by [YANG SHU] via Hackaday.IOShould such a person be in the market for a macro pad (or ‘macropad’ if you prefer), that snoot should look no further than [YANG SHU]’s 8-key programmable stream deck-like device.
The main goal here was the perfect fusion of display and feel. I’m not sure that an FDM-printed, DIY macro pad can look any better than this one does. But looks are only half the story, of course. There’s also feel, and of course, functionality.
Yes those are (hot-swappable) mechanical key switches, and they are powered by an ESP32-S2. Drawn on the 3.5″ LCD are icons and text for each switch, which of course can be easily changed in the config app.
There’s a three-direction tact switch that’s used to switch between layout profiles, and I’m sure that even this is satisfying on the feel front. Does it get better than this? Besides maybe printing it in black. I ask Hackaday.

Did you make it to Supercon this year? If so, you hold a badge with a special keyboard — a custom job by Hackaday superfriend [Arturo182], aka Solder Party. Were you wondering about its backstory?
Image by [Arturo182] via Solder PartyUnsatisfied with having to rely on a dwindling stock of BBQ20 keyboards, [Arturo182] created a fantastic replacement called the KeebDeck Keyboard.
This 69-key alphanumeric silicone number has all the keys a hacker needs, plus a rainbow of extras that can be used for macros. According to [Arturo182], the keyboard has a tactile feel thanks to a snap dome sheet underneath the keys, and this makes it more comfortable for long thumb-typing sessions.
Be sure to check out the teasers at the bottom of the KeebDeck page, because there is some really exciting stuff. If you want to build one, GitHub is your friend, pal.
Thanks for the tip, [Wim Van Gool]!
Image by [Tardigradium] via redditDon’t you just love the repeated primary colors throughout this centerfold? I do, and I think this whole arrangement shows amazing restraint. Controlled chaos, if you will. That’s what [Tardigradium]’s wife calls it, anyway.
Here’s what I know: That’s a Nulea m512 mouse, the keyboard is a KBD Craft Sachiel LEGO number, and that there is a Cidoo macro pad. Best of all, [Tardigradium] hand-painted the speakers. Neat-o!
Do you rock a sweet set of peripherals on a screamin’ desk pad? Send me a picture along with your handle and all the gory details, and you could be featured here!
Some of us (okay, I) would have thought that most accessibility inventions are fairly recent, say, from the 1960s onward. But consider the Gerda typewriter, which was created in 1919 to enable blind and one-armed victims of WWI to become employable typists.
According to the Antikey Chop, it’s quite possible that the German government helped grease the wheels of this project so that these soldiers would have a usable typewriter with which to get on with life.
Three versions of this index typewriter were produced: a two-handed Gerda, one with a Braille index, and one with an English index. All entered the market the same year, and were produced for a total of three years.
The Gerda’s typewheel was quite like Blickensderfer, and some even had the DHIATENSOR layout. More expensive than last week’s Clacker (75 Marks), the Gerdas for blind and sighted people with two hands cost 195 Marks, and the one-handed edition was 205 Marks. Some of the two-handed models had rectangular, wooden key-tops, and others had round, glass-topped keys.
I’ve been an early adopter of keyboards in the past. This is usually to bring them to your attention, either before they’re released, or just as they’ve come out. And never have I ever had this poor of an experience.
Games Radar recently reviewed a surprisingly not-failed Kickstarter keyboard that actually shipped, the Naya Create. It may not look like it, but the Create is supposed to be a gaming keyboard. What it does look like is mouse-focused, or at least mouse-forward. And that’s the point of it. Evidently.
Those big modules are interchangeable, and there are four of them so far: the Touch (a trackpad), Track (a trackball that falls out reliably), the Tune (a dial), and the Float, which is designed for space mousing around. They sound cool enough, and might actually be the best part of this whole setup.
To fully illustrate my poit I hvemt’t corrected any of the typos experieved typim this semtemve with the Naya Create while tryig to maintain my usual speed.
But according to Games Radar, the Naya Create is so not worth the $850 (!) asking price. It has ‘mushy, low-profile switches’ and clammy caps, and although the reviewer complains about the non-staggered keys, y’all know that those are my preference at this point.
And apparently, by default, Backspace is mapped to the left side. What? Of course, you can remap any key, whenever the software decides to work. Whenever the reviewer tried to save changes, the software would say that the keyboard is disconnected. Wonderful.
Despite these shortcomings, Games Radar says the keyboard is rock-solid aluminium with good hinges. So there’s that. Just, you know, swap out the switches and keycaps, and wait for software updates, I guess.
Got a hot tip that has like, anything to do with keyboards? Help me out by sending in a link or two. Don’t want all the Hackaday scribes to see it? Feel free to email me directly.

You have a better chance of getting accepted at Harvard than finding a job these days.
That's the brutal reality of the current labor market. The no-hiring-no-firing environment, dubbed the Great Freeze, is driving job seekers up a wall. And the numbers paint an even darker picture, writes BI's Aki Ito.
The average job opening last quarter received 242 applications, according to exclusive data from hiring-software provider Greenhouse. That means you have a 0.4% chance of getting the average job you apply for. Meanwhile, the acceptance rate for that school near Boston: 3.6%.
(If it makes you feel better, it could be worse. NASA took only 10 people for its 2025 Astronaut Candidate Class from more than 8,000 applicants, giving it a 0.125% acceptance rate.)
On paper, that might seem like a dream scenario for employers. Instead, they're feeling just as overwhelmed as they need to sort through the influx of résumés.
As Greenhouse CEO Daniel Chait put it to Aki: ""Nobody's happy with the current situation.""
So what's to blame?
Everyone's favorite scapegoat, artificial intelligence, is high on the list. The tech has supercharged job seekers' ability to blast themselves out to any job opportunity, essentially muddying the process for everyone.
The job market has led some workers to feel that staying put is their only option.
""Job hugging"" has become the phrase of the day, as people fear joining the beleaguered job seekers fighting for scraps. (Oh, how far we've come from The Great Resignation.)
What if you just can't see yourself sticking things out, though?
Business Insider has a five-part series of personal essays from people who have quit their jobs and have no regrets.
First up is Jenny Wood, who quit her job as a Google executive after she felt her life was no longer sustainable.
I understand a Big Tech exec is probably in a lot better position financially and professionally to walk away from their gig compared to the average American. But Wood offers real, actionable advice for people regardless of income level or seniority.
It doesn't always go well initially. In the coming days, we'll have a story from a former Apple worker who quit only to find themselves homeless. (They are in better shape now, and have no regrets.)

Elon Musk isn't just talking about AI chips. The Tesla CEO is now asking engineers who are interested in a job to email the company, and he's personally running twice-weekly design meetings.
In a post on X on Saturday night, Musk called for job applicants for Tesla's AI chip engineering team. He asked candidates to send an email with three bullet points proving their ""exceptional ability"" to Tesla. 
""We are particularly interested in applying cutting-edge AI to chip design,"" he said.
Musk said in the post that the company aims to ""bring a new AI chip design to volume production every 12 months.""
""We expect to build chips at higher volumes ultimately than all other AI chips combined,"" he added.
The current chip in Tesla cars is known as AI4, and the company is ""close to taping out AI5"" while work is starting on AI6, Musk said.
""These chips will profoundly change the world in positive ways, saving millions of lives due to safer driving and providing advanced medical care to all people via Optimus,"" Musk added. Optimus is Tesla's humanoid robot project.
Musk has been ramping up Tesla's chip ambitions. In July, the company signed a $16.5 billion deal with Samsung to manufacture Tesla's A16 chip at its new plant in Texas.
Tesla has posted Palo Alto, California-based engineering roles for its AI hardware team, including openings for physical design engineers and signal and power integrity engineers. 
The physical design engineer job requires candidates with 10 or more years of experience in designing and building integrated circuits, also known as chips. The role involves designing, constructing, and integrating the building blocks of Tesla's AI chips. The listing said the position pays about $152,000 to $264,000 a year, plus cash and stock awards and benefits. 
The signal and power integrity engineer role helps develop next-generation AI chips and systems for Tesla vehicles and Optimus robots. The position is focused on testing and validating the chips. The listing said the job pays about $120,000 to $318,000 a year, with cash and stock awards and benefits.
Musk said in the post on X on Saturday that he is ""deeply involved in the chip design"" and meets with the engineering team ""every Tuesday and Saturday.""
""The Saturday meetings are short-term and will no longer be needed in a few months when AI5 is taped out,"" he added.
Musk has long been known for inserting himself into the day-to-day work at his companies. Musk said in July he would personally oversee Samsung's new chipmaking plant in Texas. The plant, located in Taylor, Texas, is expected to open in 2026.
""This is a critical point, as I will walk the line personally to accelerate the pace of progress,"" Musk said on X, adding that the fab is ""conveniently located not far from my house.""
During Tesla's Model 3 ramp-up in 2018, Musk said he slept on the company's factory floor. After taking over Twitter — now X — in 2023, he renamed the company and rehauled its entire structure.

27,2025-11-24,"Nvidia is pushing back after investor Michael Burry of ""The Big Short"" fame took aim at the company.
A note Nvidia sent to a Wall Street analyst, a copy of which was obtained by Business Insider, addresses a spate of recent criticisms and claims made about the company and names Burry directly. It specifically cited an X post Burry made last week that said Nvidia's stock-based compensation had hurt shareholder value, ""reducing owner's earnings by 50%.""
The memo offered this direct response to Burry's claims:
Burry has recently gained attention online for going after the AI giant and expressing skepticism about the sustainability of the AI boom. He recently closed his hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, to outside cash, and launched a newsletter.
He continued his criticism of Nvidia in the first blog posted to his new Substack, ""Cassandra Unchained,"" which launched on Sunday.
In an X post on Monday, Burry acknowledged Nvidia pushing back on his arguments in the memo to analysts, adding, ""I stand by my analysis. Obviously, the full analysis does not fit in a tweet. I will release on my timeline."" 
The Nvidia memo, which was previously reported by Barron's, also addressed several other claims recently made about the AI boom, including comparisons to ""historical accounting frauds"" such as Enron, WorldCom, and Lucent.
""Nvidia does not resemble historical accounting frauds because Nvidia's underlying business is economically sound, our reporting is complete and transparent, and we care about our reputation for integrity,"" the memo said.
Nvidia, in the memo, also responded to criticisms about circular financing between the AI companies.
""First, Nvidia's strategic investments represent a small share of Nvidia's revenue and an even smaller share of approximately $1T raised each year across global private capital markets,"" the memo said, adding, ""The companies in Nvidia's strategic investment portfolio predominantly generate revenue from third-party customers, not from Nvidia.""
Nvidia declined to comment.
The stock market's AI trade has stumbled in recent weeks, with declines in the most popular momentum names being driven by investors' concerns about valuations, circular dealmaking, and worries about depreciation of high-end GPUs like the ones Nvidia makes to train AI models.

The ideal 401k balance by age 30 is 1x your annual salary, 3x by age 40, 6x by age 50, 8x by age 60, and 10x by age 67. In 2025, you can contribute up to $23,500 annually to your 401k, plus an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution if you're 50 or older. To maximize your 401k, contribute at least enough to get your full employer match, increase contributions by 1-2% annually, and aim to save 10-15% of your income for retirement across all accounts.
Understanding current contribution limits is essential for maximizing your 401k savings:
2025 Contribution Limits:
Key 2025 Changes:
Financial experts recommend these 401k balance benchmarks based on your current annual salary:
Target: 0.5x to 1x annual salaryExample: If you earn $60,000, aim for $30,000-$60,000 in your 401k
Key Strategies for Your 20s:
Target: 1x to 2x annual salaryExample: $80,000 salary should have $80,000-$160,000 saved
Focus Areas:
Target: 2x to 3x annual salaryExample: $100,000 salary should have $200,000-$300,000 saved
Strategic Priorities:
Target: 3x to 4x annual salaryExample: $120,000 salary should have $360,000-$480,000 saved
Critical Actions:
Target: 4x to 6x annual salaryExample: $140,000 salary should have $560,000-$840,000 saved
Key Focus:
Target: 6x to 7x annual salaryExample: $150,000 salary should have $900,000-$1,050,000 saved
Catch-Up Strategies:
Target: 7x to 8x annual salaryExample: $160,000 salary should have $1,120,000-$1,280,000 saved
Final Push Strategies:
Target: 8x to 10x annual salary by retirementExample: $170,000 salary should have $1,360,000-$1,700,000 saved
Retirement Preparation:
Employer matching is free moneyâtypically 25-100% immediate return on your contribution. Common matching formulas include:
Traditional 401k (Tax-deferred):
Roth 401k (Tax-free growth):
Age-Based Asset Allocation Guidelines:
Low-Cost Investment Strategies:
If your plan allows after-tax contributions:
Some plans allow in-service distributions at age 59Â½:
If you hold company stock in your 401k:
How much should I have in my 401k by age 30?âBy age 30, you should ideally have saved 1x your annual salary in your 401k. For example, if you earn $70,000, aim for $70,000 in retirement savings. If you started saving at 22 and contribute 10-15% of your income with employer matching, this target is achievable. If you're behind, don't panicâstart contributing at least enough to get your full employer match and increase contributions by 1-2% each year until you're saving 15% of your income.
Is it better to contribute to traditional or Roth 401k?âThe choice depends on your current vs. expected retirement tax rates. Traditional 401k contributions reduce current taxes and are better if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement. Roth 401k contributions are made with after-tax dollars but grow tax-free, making them ideal for younger workers, those expecting higher future tax rates, or high earners who want tax diversification. Many experts recommend a mix of both, with younger workers favoring Roth and older, high earners focusing on traditional.
What happens if I don't contribute enough to get my full employer match?âYou're essentially leaving free money on the table. Employer matching provides an immediate 25-100% return on your contributionâbetter than any investment. For example, if your employer matches 50% of your first 6% contribution and you only contribute 4%, you're missing 1% of salary in free matching funds. Always prioritize contributing enough to maximize your employer match before focusing on other financial goals.
Can I contribute to a 401k and IRA in the same year?âYes, you can contribute to both a 401k and IRA in the same year, subject to separate contribution limits. In 2025, you can contribute up to $23,500 to your 401k plus $7,000 to an IRA (with additional catch-up contributions if you're 50+). However, IRA tax deductibility may be limited if you're covered by a workplace retirement plan and earn above certain income thresholds ($73,000-$83,000 for single filers in 2024).
Should I take a 401k loan to pay off debt or buy a house?âGenerally, no. 401k loans interrupt compound growth, must be repaid within 5 years (longer for home purchases), and become immediately due if you leave your job. If you can't repay on time, the loan becomes a taxable distribution plus 10% penalty if under age 59Â½. Instead, consider other options: emergency fund for unexpected expenses, conventional mortgage for home purchase, or debt consolidation loans for high-interest debt. Only consider 401k loans as a last resort.
Success with 401k savings requires starting early, contributing consistently, and increasing contributions over time. The power of compound interest means that even small contributions in your 20s can grow to significant amounts by retirement.
Universal Principles:
Age-Specific Priorities:
Remember, these are guidelinesâyour individual situation may require different strategies. The most important step is starting now and contributing consistently, regardless of your age.

30,2025-11-24,"Apple is making progress on the development of the book-style foldable iPhone expected in 2026, according to a report from Chinese site UDN. The device has reportedly entered the engineering validation stage, and Apple is gearing up for mass production.
Citing supply chain sources, UDN says that Apple has solved ""the crease problem"" that has plagued most foldable smartphones, and the foldable ‌iPhone‌ will be the first crease-free foldable smartphone on the market. We've heard multiple prior rumors about Apple's intensive work on the hinge and display to minimize creasing, so this isn't the first time the foldable ‌iPhone‌ has been rumored to have a seamless screen.
Apple is using an inner screen designed by Samsung, but the panel structure, lamination method, and material process was designed by Apple. Apple worked with its suppliers to come up with a hinge design that prevents a permanent crease, and the hinge will adopt Liquid Metal components. By using Liquid Metal, Apple was able to design an ‌iPhone‌ that has a durable hinge that still has a slim design.
Apple will allegedly call the device the ""‌iPhone‌ Fold,"" which is the name sites have already adopted when sharing rumors about the product.
There have been rumors suggesting that Apple could delay the foldable iPhone beyond 2026, but if Apple is ready for the engineering validation stage of ‌iPhone‌ development, a September 2026 launch timeline as planned is entirely plausible.

Late last week, a German musiciansâ organization scored a pretty crushing legal victory against OpenAI. The court says the training of the GPT 4 and 4o models included copyright infringement, and that some outputs of the models are themselves infringement. A pretty comprehensive win for the âitâs just a plagiarism machineâ crowd.
Seasoned OpenAI haters will agree, I think, with at least some of the recent legal analysis of the ruling by intellectual property law scholar Andres Guadamuz of the University of Sussex. Guadamuz points out that the decision and its implications are a bit messy, but may truly benefit copyright holders in the long term.
That likely means copyright big fishâpop stars, Hollywood actors, and bestselling authorsâshould now be getting a sense of how this technology might benefit them monetarily, even if small-time creators might not be so lucky.
The context: GEMA is a German organization with no American equivalent, a copyright collective representing the interests of composers, lyricists, and publishers. It sued OpenAI on behalf of stakeholders related to nine famous and uncontroversial German songs. This would be like suing on behalf of the composers and lyricists of nine American songs that run the gamut from âSoak Up the Sunâ by Sheryl Crow to âHappyâ by Pharrell Williams.
In other words, these arenât lyrics that OpenAI dug up once from a garage bandâs website and turned into training data. Instead, they are inescapable cultural touchstones that would have appeared in training data again and again in multiple, potentially altered, or parodied forms, and as fragments, excerpts, and snippets.
The basis of the suit was that after turning off ChatGPTâs ability to browse the web, users were able to feed it queries like âWhat is the second verse of [the German equivalent of âNo Scrubsâ by TLC]?â And ChatGPT would reply with a sometimes fragmented or flawed, but largely correct answer.
The ruling is from the Munich Regional Court, and naturally itâs in German, but a Google Translated version gave me the following broad-strokes interpretation of what the court determined:
The model itself stored illegal reproductions of the lyrics to those songs. When it regurgitated the lyrics in response to prompts, even if it was producing the lyrics in incomplete form, or hallucinating wrong lyrics, that was a further act of infringement. Importantly, some hypothetical ChatGPT user attempting to get lyrics from ChatGPT is not the copyright infringer; OpenAI is. And because ChatGPT outputs have shareable links, OpenAI was making this infringing material available to the public without permission.
OpenAI must at some point now disclose how often the texts of these lyrics were used as training data, and when, if ever, it made money from them. It also has to stop storing them, and must not output them again. Monetary damages may be determined at some point later.
Earlier this month, a somewhat similar court case in the UK went precisely the other way: Getty Images lost its case against Stability AI, because, the judge in that case wrote, âAn AI model such as Stable Diffusion which does not store or reproduce any copyright works (and has never done so) is not an âinfringing copyâ.â
Guadamuzâs analysis is interesting on this point, because it gets at what the court was thinking here. The German court, Guadamuz notes, relied on research about machine âmemorization,â something a model can more easily and obviously do with lyrics than with, say, a Getty Images photo it was trained on.
So in contrast to the Getty ruling, this new ruling is consistent with a lot of the existing intellectual property legal thought in the digital eraâthat the same copyright rules apply to, say, a playable CD and a CD-Rom.
So as long as the copyrighted material can be made perceptible again, itâs a monetizable copy of the artwork. Thatâs also the case with lyrics âcontainedâ within an LLM.
Guadamuz takes issue, however, with how the ruling further treats this âmemorizationâ concept, seemingly attempting to make training without memorization the legal norm by using an EU data-mining law. In a local sense, Guadamuz finds this to be a problem because it assumes a condition that doesnât match what the law says. But more importantly, it seems to suggest that memorization always occurs when training on a given work, which Guadamuz says isnât the case.
That legal sloppiness could be a problem as companies interpret this case in the coming years, but the takeaway for Guadamuz is this: we will most likely âeventually end up with some form of licensing market.â
Like with Sora 2âs treatment of copyright and likeness, which many actors and copyright holders eventually approved of, a framework is slowly materializing aimed at sharing revenue (theoretical, future AI revenue) with the owners of copyrighted texts. OpenAI shocked all the worldâs copyright holders by creating a whole new universe of perceived copyright infringement. Artists and creators understandably felt robbed.
But slowly, powerful stakeholders are warming up to the idea of generative AI, because theyâre starting to envision how theyâll get their beaks wet, and just how wet their beaks might eventually be. You can see this with major U.S. record labels now teaming up with companies they had once sued, like Udio.
But as for the dry, chapped beaks of powerless copyright stakeholdersâsmall-time artists, writers, and creatorsâconcerned that their work will simply be made redundant or irrelevant in this weird new content universe, itâs still not at all clear how those beaks benefit from any of this.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Another day, AI-driven demand continues to affect hardware pricing. AMD has reportedly informed its partners that GPU costs are set to rise due to higher DRAM prices, with increases expected to be at least 10 percent. The shift is linked to memory supply being redirected toward AI datacenters, which is putting pressure on component availability and pushing costs upward.
RAM pricing is already climbing, and that impact is now moving into the consumer graphics card market. There are still some solid GPU deals available during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, so it may be worth watching current discounts before pricing adjustments reach retail.
ASRock Challenger RX 9070 XT packs 16GB memory, triple‑fan cooling, PCIe 5.0 support, and 8K resolution capability — delivering smooth, high‑performance gaming at an impressive value.
AMD cards rely on GDDR6 memory, and that memory is becoming more expensive due to demand from large AI datacenters. It is reasonable to expect NVIDIA and Intel to face similar pressures, which could lead to comparable pricing changes across the board. Console hardware is also being speculated as a possible area of impact, with Xbox pricing potentially increasing according to Moore's Law Is Dead, which could mean Sony could face similar conditions next year if current reports prove accurate.
Right now, it could be a sensible moment to upgrade a GPU, whether you favour AMD or NVIDIA, since current pricing may not last once the next wave of stock arrives at a higher cost.
ASRock Steel Legend RX 9070 XT delivers 16GB memory, triple‑fan cooling, PCIe 5.0 support, and 8K resolution — built for gamers and creators who demand power and stability.
With pricing expected to rise once current batches sell through, it puts many PC gamers in a tough spot, myself included. Deciding whether to upgrade now or hold out and hope for better conditions later. If you were already shopping for a new card, the deals available today might be the safest window before adjusted pricing lands.
Some people will wait to see how far prices climb or whether competition helps steady the market. Others will grab something now to avoid paying more for the same level of performance in a few weeks.
Sapphire Nitro+ RX 9070 XT Gaming OC packs 16GB GDDR6, AMD RDNA 4 architecture, triple‑fan cooling, and 8K support — built for elite performance and smooth gameplay.

35,2025-11-24,"
    For the leading smart ring maker, ""calm tech"" seems to be the winning strategy.
  
Does tech stress you out? The Oura Ring is supposed to do the opposite.
When I sit down with Oura's CEO, Tom Hale, in a quiet wooden booth on the outskirts of the Web Summit technology conference in Lisbon, I notice that he's wearing two smart rings. Is he conducting competitor analysis? No, it turns out. Both of the rings are his own company's devices.
One, he explains, is his personal ring, which contains all his data from the past four years. The second is linked to his beta account and shows him what's coming in the next software update.
For Hale, wearing two rings that run two sets of software allows him to be plugged into every minuscule variation in data. This type of hyperfocus, essential for his job with the world's leading smart ring maker, enables him to understand the ever-evolving experience of Oura customers before they do. 
But being on high alert is not what he wants for the rest of us. Quite the opposite, in fact.
""Our philosophy very much is about being in the background,"" says Hale. ""We think of ourselves as calm tech."" 
Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.
Calm tech is a departure from the majority of other wearable devices on the market, and it seems to be resonating. Over the past year, smart rings, which primarily measure activity and sleep, have surged in popularity, with sales more than doubling to 1.8 million units in 2024, and expected to hit around 4 million units this year, according to Omdia. 
Many of us are choosing them over the best fitness trackers. Smart rings accounted for 75% of all fitness tracker revenue in the US this year, up from 46% the previous year, according to Circana. 
Unlike standard fitness trackers, smart rings can't provide real-time feedback, stats and coaching on your wrist. Instead, they record and synthesize your activity and sleep data for viewing on your phone at a later time. That's enough for most people. The trade-off is especially worth it for those of us who want to nurture a less anxious attachment style to our personal tech and prioritize a real-world focus. 
The majority of other wearables on the market aren't conducive to this ""passive"" relationship. Smartwatches -- and, for the most part, smart glasses -- are body-worn screens, contributing to the ever-increasing and omnipresent information overload that tech subjects us to.
Smart rings are, by their very nature, screen-free devices, and Oura wants to keep it that way. The Oura Ring 4 doesn't include any flashing lights and indicators (it does have LEDs on the inside for measuring heart rate and blood oxygen). That decision was geared toward maintaining peace of mind, according to Hale.
""A lot of the most engaging and demanding applications are ones notifying you and creating anxiety where it doesn't need to be there,"" he says. ""'Oh, your heart rate's elevated. You're dying.' Who needs that message? I don't need that message.""
I don't need it either. I'm far from alone in feeling that unfettered health tracking can quickly descend into an anxiety-inducing nightmare that causes more harm than good. Obsessing over not getting enough sleep has been known to induce insomnia. Intensive calorie tracking can cause people to disregard their bodies' signals and ignore hunger cues.
This, Hale tells me, is what Oura strives to avoid. When the company introduced meal tracking into its app earlier this year, it was careful about how it framed the feedback, focusing on ""gentle"" advice.
The feature allows you to upload a picture of your food and input a brief description, before it's scanned by AI and given a rating: nutritious, good, fair or limited. I raise my eyebrow at the inclusion of ""good"" as a rating. It could read as assigning a moral value to the food you've eaten. But Oura chose not to include a ""bad"" rating, which takes some of the sting out of it.
Oura introduced food tracking this year.
Oura also tries to steer people away from focusing on assigning a numerical value to their food, ""which I think lends itself to sort of obsessive behaviors,"" says Hale. You can see caloric intake if you wish, but Oura also offers a switch to let you turn off any mention of calories.
""For some people, counting calories is really triggering,"" says Hale. ""We try to be very sensitive to that, because we don't want to create an unhealthy relationship with it, and we don't want to shame people.""
For Oura customers to get the most out of their ring and subscription, Hale's No. 1 tip is not to put too much value on a single health metric, but instead to take a holistic approach to the information to guide their actions. (Oura provides data on 40 different activities under its $6/£6 per month fee. By contrast, the Samsung Ring offers more limited tracking but free of charge.)
Hale says the company is not focused on measuring bodies. ""We're in the behavior-change business,"" he says. 
In the case of food, this might work by observing how your body reacts to what you're eating and then examining how that reaction intersects with other factors, such as whether you're rested, stressed or have exercised earlier that day.
Hale shows me a picture of the Portuguese flan he'd eaten the night before while in Lisbon. ""Shocker,"" he says, ""look at my blood sugar spike."" 
There's nothing wrong with having the flan -- it certainly doesn't seem to have subdued Hale, who is animated and full of energy throughout our conversation. But seeing the impact of a rich, sugar-heavy meal late in the evening after a busy day at a tech event might help you understand how you feel, or even nudge you into eating differently the next day to balance things out.
Oura's goal is to build context around why your body might be behaving a certain way, and increasingly, provide personalized, generative AI support via an LLM-powered chatbot that you can talk to about injuries and offer tailored advice. This, too, can help relieve any stress you might be feeling about your health, says Hale.
""One of the things that we try to do is strike a supportive tone in the AI, to kind of be like: 'You had a bad night's sleep, but it's going to be OK.'"" he says.
The AI Oura Advisor, which the company launched in summer 2024, can prompt the kind of behavior change Hale wants for Oura customers, such as suggesting you take a walk after a heavy meal to aid digestion. It even takes into account one frequently overlooked element of long-term health -- social connection -- and will prompt you to spend time with friends and family. 
The Oura Advisor will allow you deep dive into any health trends with the help of AI.
Over the past few years, there has been an explosion in longevity culture, with people investing money in products and services, like supplements and wellness services, that promise to extend their life and health spans. 
The ""moral hazard"" of these products, says Hale, is that there's no accountability. ""If it works, great,"" he says. ""If it doesn't work, you're not gonna call me. You know why? Because you're dead.""
Oura doesn't exclude itself entirely from the conversation around longevity. Back in May, it released an ad that Hale calls ""cheeky,"" featuring older adults wearing Oura rings and living their best lives. But it didn't promise we'd all become centenarians.
""Our premise is not: Hey, buy our supplement because you want to live forever,"" says Hale. ""Our premise is: Change your behavior today to make healthy choices, because then you'll live a better life.""
It's a convincing pitch, which might explain why Oura surpassed 5.5 million total rings sold back in September, putting it on track to hit $1 billion in revenue for the first time this year. According to the latest stats shared by the International Data Corporation, published in 2024, the company boasted an 80% market share.
Last month, the company scored a ""decisive victory"" in a patent infringement lawsuit against two of its competitors, Ringconn and Ultrahuman. So when Hale tells me he doesn't test rivals' rings ""as much as he used to"" because they're ""copying us,"" I know it's more than bravado.
Thanks to its intellectual property and growing troves of health data that enable it to refine its software, Oura has a clear competitive advantage in this rapidly growing market.
""I'm looking not for other things that other people are doing,"" Hale says. ""I'm looking for the stuff that we should do that's really innovative.""

Next-GenSteam MachineValve 
Valve hasn’t officially announced the price of its upcoming Steam Machine consoles. Maybe even CEO Gabe Newell doesn’t know how much the company will eventually decide to charge. But that hasn’t stopped a drip-feed of quote and speculation from pointing toward the higher end of the pricing spectrum. The company recently confirmed it won’t be subsidizing the devices, seemingly squashing any chance of it being less than the price of a PlayStation 5 Pro.
That was the sense we got from comments Valve made back when the Steam Machines were first revealed. Despite an emphasis on “affordability,” the company was also quick to confirm that the consoles would be “very competitive with a PC you could build yourself from parts” but also closer to the “entry level of the PC space” than what some fans might be expecting.
Last week on his LinusTechTips YouTube channel, Linus Gabriel Sebastian confirmed that he asked Valve directly if the smaller storage Steam Machine would be in line with a current $500 console. “Nobody said anything, but the energy of the room wasn’t great,â he said.
The scales have now tipped even further away from that price point in an interview Valve did with gaming channel Skill Up. YouTuber Ralph Panebianco asked point-blank if the company would use proceeds from Steam to make the hardware cheaper than it costs to manufacture. “No,” software engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais said. “It’s more in line with what you might expect from the current PC market. Obviously, our goal is for it to be a good deal at that level of performance.â
It’s not been uncommon in the past for console makers to underprice hardware in order to grow their install base and make more money off of selling more games and servers on the backend. As the biggest PC gaming store around, Valve has billions of profits it could through at gaining market share in a potential console war. It sounds like that’s not what the company has planned, however.
No subsidies is basically the final nail in the coffin for any hope that the Steam Machine will be priced to compete directly with a Switch 2, PS5, or pre-tariff Xbox Series X. Some fans are still hoping the 512GB model might come in between $600 and $700, which would put it around the current price of the 1TB Steam Deck OLED.
Even that seems overly optimistic, especially with recent reports that the AI arms race is about to push PC component prices even higher. Next-gen consoles, which all rely on the same chip makers, will be facing similar pressures. We’ll see how it all shakes out when Valve reveals the Steam Machine price early next year. Who knows. Maybe the PS6 and next Xbox won’t be anywhere close to $500, either.

38,2025-11-24,"A reveal that could make or break Valve’s return to the living room console fight before it even begins.

Steam Machine is Valve’s second attempt at entering the console space, with the original Steam Machine launching around a decade ago and failing in a big way. Valve did not walk away from the idea, and this time it feels like it might be cooking something more promising.
The new Steam Machine runs on SteamOS, Valve’s Linux-based operating system that delivers a console-like experience, while still allowing users to install Windows if they prefer.
Excitement has grown because of the success of SteamOS on Steam Deck and the rise of Linux gaming on Steam.
Since its reveal, the biggest question has been the price. Valve has not confirmed it yet, but speculation is growing, and Valve has dropped hints about what people should expect. Based on what has been said so far, expectations are starting to look uncertain.
 



According to Valve, the price of the Steam Machine will sit in line with what it would cost to build a PC with similar performance. Estimates put that anywhere from around 700 dollars up to nearly 1,000 dollars, which feels unlikely to make an impact in the console market, especially in the current climate in the US.
Another major factor is that Valve has confirmed it will not subsidise the price of the Steam Machine as it did with the Steam Deck. Traditional consoles can launch at a loss, as platform holders make money back through software sales, which is why consoles have usually been more accessible, and why the Steam Deck arrived at a much friendlier price point.
With the Steam Machine, Valve has no intention of doing that, which means the hardware cost could be higher than many people are willing to pay for something new. That becomes even more of a concern when the system will not be able to play the biggest multiplayer games, such as Call of Duty, Fortnite, or Minecraft.
All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.
The news comes from YouTuber SkillUp, who asked Valve Software Engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais directly about pricing and whether Valve would subsidize the device, and Griffais replied with:
No, it’s more in line with what you might expect from the current PC market. Obviously, our goal is for it to be a good deal at that level of performance. And then you have features that are actually really hard to build if you are making your own gaming PC from parts. Things like the small form factor, the noise level that we achieved, or lack thereof, is really impressive and we are excited that people are going to find out how quiet this thing is. But also, some integration features like HDMI CEC. The Bluetooth and wireless work that we’ve done, the four antennas, the very deliberate design so that you can have a great experience with four Bluetooth controllers
It is good that Valve is being upfront about pricing, but it is still disappointing. In my view, if it cannot land at a competitive price, Steam Machine risks repeating the outcome of the original attempt, where it failed to find a clear audience and never gained momentum.
That would be a shame, because the market needs more competition to keep pushing forward, and a strong living room device built around Steam could have been exactly that.
What do you think? With no subsidies, does the Steam Machine stand a chance, and is this a good opportunity for Microsoft and Xbox to try to compete? Let us know in the comments!

AIGTA 5Red Dead Redemption 2 
AI’s biggest boosters promise a near-future where advanced levels of automation do, well, everything. Rockstar cofounder Dan Houser, who helped write Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption 2, isnât convinced. He recently commented that while LLM tech can impress, itâs far from the magic solution many are hyping it up to be.
Houser appeared over the weekend on Sunday Brunch, a British talk show, to talk about his studio and entertainment company Absurd Ventures, and to plug his new novel, A Better Paradise (h/t PCGamesN). Given the novelâs focus on AI characters, and the state of the tech industry and game development, it was only natural for the hosts to ask what Houser thinks of real AI and whether heâs making use of it in his creative works.
âWe are dabbling in using AI,â Houser said, âbut the truth is a lot of itâs not as useful as some of the companies would have you believe.â Houser pushed back on the rather eccentric promises of tech CEOs, âthey will claim it can solve every single problem, and it really canât yet.â
Houserâs comments follow some recent controversy surrounding AI and video games. Call of Duty recently caught some heat for its rather obnoxious use of fully AI-generated images in-game. Meanwhile, Ubisoft is going all in on AI tools to produce future games, recently showing off what it calls the âfirst playable generative AI research project.â
But as Houser argues, much of the hype surrounding the tech is âjust to sell AI stock,â and all of its promises seem only possible âif we give it all of our money.â He notes that many automated processes are simply a fact of modern computing and are typically best at doing rather boring and mundane tasks. Houser hasnât ruled out the tech entirely, saying that it will âbe interesting to seeâ how AI grows in its capacity to handle more precious creative tasks, he sounds much more skeptical than some developers who tout AI as the next revolution for gaming.

42,2025-11-24,"With iPhone Air, Apple reintroduced the MagSafe battery pack. It’s $99, and optimized specifically for iPhone Air. It’s rather slim, though it’s rather weak in capacity – making Qi2 alternatives all the more interesting. We’ll be delving into the top options on the market, just in case you want a MagSafe battery for your iPhone without spending $99, or aren’t buying the iPhone Air.
Since Apple opened up the MagSafe standard as Qi2 last year, third parties have been able to make MagSafe chargers with support for 15W of charging. Prior to that, third parties only offered 7.5W with the initial Qi standard.
Another interesting fact: Apple’s iPhone Air MagSafe battery only supports up to 12W of charging, despite the iPhone Air supporting up to 20W of charging with MagSafe. That actually means third-party options are stronger in the charging speed department. We’ll be delving into those.
First things first is the Anker Nano Power Bank. This one is the mid-range option on the list, but it comes first because I’ve had tons of hands on time with it and can speak with first-hand experience with how thin it is, as well as how premium it feels. The form factor is rather remarkable, and likely serves as the closest alternative to Apple’s MagSafe battery. Read my full review here.
It charges your devices at 15W thanks to Qi2, offers 5000mAh of capacity, and runs cooler than the competition. Normally $54.99, it’s available for just $38.49 with early Black Friday deals. You can pick one up in black or white.
While I haven’t personally spent time with this battery bank, I have spent enough time with other Baseus products to know that this will likely be a good option. It’s the cheapest option on this list, coming in at just $18.99 currently. It’s similarly thin to the Anker one, while offering 5000mAh of capacity.
Main caveat here is the fact that this doesn’t support Qi2, so you’ll be limited to 7.5W of charging speed. That could be rather annoying if you’re trying to recharge your phone in a pinch, though you can also use a USB-C cable for 20W of wired charging if it truly comes down to it. It comes in four colors: Cosmic Black, Rose Pink, Natural Titanium, and Space Gray.
This UGREEN option isn’t as thin as the others, but it’s here for good reason. It offers 10000mAh of capacity, and it also supports Qi2.2. That enables it to recharge devices at up to 25W, and isn’t yet widely supported on the market. You’ll need an iPhone 16 or later to utilize Qi2.2.
If form factor isn’t your biggest concern, and you just want the most battery capacity in a MagSafe battery, this is the best choice. Just like all of the other options, it also supports 30W wired charging through the USB-C port, faster than others on the list – and it also has a built in USB-C cable if you need it.
This one is the most expensive option in the list, but it’s also the most capable. It’s available on Amazon for $59.99 during Black Friday week deals. There’s also a neat display that allows you to check its capacity.

Viktors Zeglovs, 34, of no fixed address, was charged with the murder of Vadims Zmicerevskis, 45, following an incident at the junction of Green Lane and St Thomas Road in Spalding on 11 November 2024.
Zeglovs, who had previously pleaded not guilty to the charge and was due to stand trial, appeared at Lincoln Crown Court via videolink from prison.
He is due to be sentenced on 11 December.
The incident came after ""a relatively trivial argument"" that escalated quickly, with Zeglovs driving a broken bottle towards his friend's throat, the court was told.
Prosecutor John Lloyd Jones KC said it was accepted that whatever Zeglovs' intentions were that day he did not set out to kill his friend, adding that the defendant could be seen on CCTV footage acting with remorse and tending to his dying friend.
""Unsurprisingly, he died,"" the barrister added.
Adjourning the case, Judge Catarina Sjolin Knight told Zeglovs: ""I will determine what your intent was.""
Zeglovs, who is from Latvia and followed the hearing via a Russian interpreter, was remanded back into custody.

Just when we thought we were settled into the new normal of tariff-borne PC and gaming console price hikes, next yearâs devices are set to be even more expensive. You can blame the current favorite buzzwordâAIâfor the increasing cost of RAM and flash storage. All computers depend on memory to some extent, but those who want the biggest, best PCs or gaming devices will feel the sticker shock worst of all.
Weâve been reporting about the spiking cost of RAM prices since October. Essentially, AI data centers have such a demand for memory that the prices of SSDs (solid state drives), DRAM (dynamic random access memory), and HDDs (hard disk drives) are all ballooning in price. This is most keenly felt in the discrete PC RAM market. Corsair, one of the most popular brands for fast, gaming-ready RAM sticks, told Gizmodo over email, âOur DRAM prices have increased in response to the severe supply shortage we are seeing across the industry.â
And it just keeps getting worse. A pack of 64GB DDR5 RAM from memory brand Crucial spiked from $150 to more than $400 in just two months, as evidenced by the Amazon price tracking site camelcamelcamel. Other, lower-end RAM sticks may see less of a bump, but users will inevitably find the more RAM they want, the more it will cost. Four sticks of 16GB DDR5 RAM from Corsair now sell for an astronomical $688. The same sticks in white demand $948. And theyâre not even the priciest RAM available.
Memory prices will inevitably impact the laptop industry as well.

PCs are getting hit the hardest, especially if you had hopes of finally upgrading your desktop tower with new components. After months of scarcity, the price of GPUs from both Nvidia and AMD has normalized closer to the original suggested retail price. A Radeon RX 9070 XT remains a hot commodity and is still going for more than $600 MSRP at most retailers. However, numerous leakers have proposed that GPUs could see price hikes due to the ballooning cost of VRAM.
PowerColor, one of AMDâs board partners who makes discrete GPUs, took to Reddit last week (via VideoCardz) to tell users to âbuy before the last week of the year before prices kick up.â The PR rep in this case was referring to possible deals happening before Black Friday but added in an update that this was in response to consumers âasking for advice on if they should ‘buy now’ because of market conditions.â
Taiwanese media outlet UDN further claimed, based on anonymous sources, that AMD GPU prices could go up from several major board partners, including Gigabyte and Asus, as well as PowerColor.
Consoles won’t be spared of potential price hikes, either. Microsoftâs Xbox brand pushed the cost of tariffs onto consumers twice in 2025 with its Xbox Series X and Series S. Now, the high-end console with a disc drive costs $650, $150 more than it did at launch five years ago. YouTuber “Mooreâs Law Is Dead,” who has consistently leaked information on unreleased AMD hardware, claimed in a recent video that Microsoft is telling partners that it may need to jack up prices for Xbox consoles once more, or else stock could significantly diminish âsooner rather than later.â
The YouTuber further claimed that Sony âplanned ahead, bought up gobs of RAM near the bottom of the pricing, and thus they should be fine for months.â Thatâs small comfort, however, for those who still plan to buy a Nintendo Switch 2. The system comes with 256GB of internal storage, and you need Express-level microSD cards to expand that limited storage capacity. Technohouse Toei, a Japan-centric computer store, told the Japanese outlet IT Media (read by machine translation) that itâs getting more difficult to acquire large-capacity microSD cards.
Analysts anticipate that flash storage prices will climb through the roof in early 2026. Citing reports from the Commercial Times and Reuters, analyst firm TrendForce reported late last week that the makers of NAND storage are âtaking turns raising prices.â And this situation may not get any better over the following months. Sure, TrendForce said the memory sector is going to grow as fast as the tale of Jackâs beanstalk, but that wonât necessarily fix demand. Earlier this month, Korean-centric newspaper Chosun Biz reported that major flash storage manufacturers like Samsung and SK Hynix actually cut supply in the second half of 2025. Samsung is âinternally reviewingâ price hikes of 20% to 30%, according to Chosun.
Either memory production has to increase to meet demand, or else the AI data centers have to stop sucking down the worldâs supply of SSDs and HDDs. The sooner the AI bubble bursts, the better it will be for PC prices.

Elon Musk’s X activated a new feature over the weekend called “About this account,” which allows anyone to check where in the world an account is based. Many accounts purporting to be from the U.S. have been exposed as foreign influence operations. But the chaotic rollout by X has allowed plenty of disinformation to spread and is likely to cause even more problems for verifying information in the future.
It all started the night of Thursday, Nov. 20, when X users noticed that they could check the location of their own accounts by clicking the “joined” date in their bio. Users were expecting the rollout, since Xâs head of product, Nikita Bier, wrote last week that it would be coming soon.
Right-wing influencer Katie Pavlich tweeted Nov. 15: “Hey @elonmusk, please make it mandatory that wherever an account is based – country – be featured in an accountâs public profile. Foreign bots are tearing America apart. Thanks.”
Bier responded the same day with, “Give me 72 hours.”
Give me 72 hours.
— Nikita Bier (@nikitabier) November 16, 2025

It took a bit longer than 72 hours, but users started to notice some locations on Nov. 20 and into the morning of Friday, Nov. 21. Some people claimed they could see the locations of other users, though Gizmodo couldn’t independently verify that claim. X hasn’t clarified whether the feature was actually live for other users to see a location. In a since-deleted tweet, Bier seemed to suggest people could only see their own location.
Whether it was fully live or not, people were already making photoshopped versions of various users to make them look like they were based in countries that they weren’t. But by not being clear about what was happening and when, it set off an opportunity for people to make more jokes, as well as to intentionally spread lies. And these lies couldn’t be fact-checked by going to a given user’s account.
In that fog of confusion, various claims emerged on X that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s account was based in Israel. Since the feature appeared to be disabled, nobody could actually check for themselves. But an Australia-based account called sneedfeeder posted a screen recording that claimed to show it was real during a period when people claimed there were glitches producing erroneous information.
By Saturday, Nov. 22, the feature was properly rolled out, and it was only a few hours later that Bier tweeted, “I need a drink.” Why? Because chaos had truly been unleashed, with countless MAGA accounts suddenly exposed as foreign operations. MAGANationX? Based in Eastern Europe. An account called News Ivanka Trump? Based in Nigeria. Barron Trump News? Also based in Eastern Europe. It went on and on like that Sunday in a seemingly endless parade of accounts that pretended to be pro-Trump “patriots” living in the U.S.
Other location reveals were less damning, but still interesting given their history of U.S.-focused content. DogeDesigner, an account that frequently gets boosted by Elon Musk and has over 1.7 million followers, is based in India. WallStreetBets, an account that shares a name with the subreddit that helped create the meme stock craze, is apparently based in Mexico. Ian Miles Cheong, a far-right influencer who often gets ridiculed for his obsession with U.S. politics, was long thought to be based in Malaysia. In reality, it turns out he’s based in the United Arab Emirates, according to X.
Cheong is not happy about his location being revealed like that. And he kind of has a point. There are plenty of reasons why anonymity might be important, and this does violate individual privacy in ways that users didn’t get much warning about. The new feature also reveals if a user might be using a VPN, something that is both necessary and often illegal in authoritarian countries that have banned U.S. social media sites.
And there are still so many questions about how this location tracker works and whether we can trust it. Bier tried to explain what it’s doing by writing: “It’ll update periodically based on available information. If it isn’t correct due to temporary relocation, it should update in fewer than 30 days.” But the location doesn’t appear to be working retroactively. Gizmodo checked a dormant account created in a country outside the U.S., and it simply didn’t have any location information.
What about that video purporting to show that the DHS account was being run out of Israel? DHS has denied that the video is real.
“I canât believe we have to say this, but this account has only ever been run and operated from the United States,” the DHS account wrote on Sunday. “Screenshots are easy to forge, videos are easy to manipulate. Thank you for your attention to this matter.”
Bier, for what it’s worth, said that “Location was not available on any gray check account at any point,” referring to the color of the verification checks given to government accounts. He also insisted that “the account has only shown IPs from the United States” since its creation.
And it’s extremely likely DHS is telling the truth in this case, even if they lie about so many other topics. But it’s still entirely possible that there was some kind of glitch that allowed some users to see the locations of others, however briefly. We just don’t know for sure. In this environment, Musk and his employees at X are adding to the confusion.
Musk bought Twitter in October 2022 and set about radically changing the site. He got rid of so-called legacy verification, allowing anyone with $8 to buy a blue checkmark. The checkmark didn’t actually mean anything beyond the fact that a given user had $8, but Musk insisted that it was the best way to fight bots and fraud on the site. After all, who would spend $8? Well, a lot of people will spend $8, especially if your motive is to benefit from influencing people in another country.
Musk also launched a creator payout program, still another incentive for people to spend $8. If you’re going to make more than $8 per month for your ragebait and MAGA engagement, of course, you’ll make that kind of investment.
There’s also the question of how much anyone can trust the location information if the man who controls it is untrustworthy. If you checked Elon Musk’s location information over the weekend, it said he was based in the U.S., but it also said he was verified in 1969. This appears to be nothing more than a “69” joke since he was born in 1971 and it wasn’t a nod to his birth year. If you checked on Monday, it says Musk has been verified since 3000 BCE.
Musk is a far-right disinformation agent in his own right. He spent $43 billion to buy Twitter and has used it as a tool to promote his own worldview. The billionaire frequently admits that he’s manipulating both X and his AI chatbot Grok to conform to how he sees the world politically.
When an X user asked Musk last week why they were seeing tweets from left-wing lawmakers, Musk replied, “Because we are failing very badly with the recommendations algorithm. Doing my best to address this.”
Because we are failing very badly with the recommendations algorithm. 
Doing my best to address this.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 20, 2025

The Tesla CEO isn’t trying to hide it. He’s built a radicalization engine, and when he tinkers with it too much, it praises Hitler and floats conspiracy theories about the killing of white farmers in South Africa. Just last week, Grok was saying that Musk was smarter than Albert Einstein and more fit than LeBron James. It also said that Musk was more worthy of devotion than Jesus Christ. But those kinds of high-profile flubs aren’t the influence operations that average users should really be worried about.
X is a mess, even on its best day. But Musk seems determined to make it even more chaotic with the rollout of a feature that doesn’t even make him look good. He’s built a site that’s swarming with white supremacists, anti-trans bigots, and pro-MAGA dipshits. And it turns out half those folks aren’t even based where they say they’re based.
Can you even trust that people are actually based where X says they’re based? Users are likely to point to this new feature as “proof.” But it’s important to keep in mind who you’re trusting when you cite X as a source. You’re putting your faith in the same guy who’s currently listed as being verified since 3000 BCE.

53,2025-11-24,"The air above Palau's pristine waters smells of salt and breadfruit, and on calm mornings in Koror, Palau's commercial centre, the whirr of dive boat engines echoes across the bay.
A few years ago, those boats were filled with tourists – many from China – drawn to Palau's lagoons and limestone caves. Hotels were full, restaurants bustling, and fishermen could barely keep up with demand. But that is no more.
The boom – and the abrupt collapse – was no accident. Between 2015 and 2017, Chinese tourists made up around half of its visitors. Then, in 2017, Beijing reportedly ordered tour operators to stop selling packages to Palau, slashing the main source of tourism to the islands at the time.
""I actually bought new boats to accommodate the sudden increase of tourists,"" said a dive shop owner in Koror. But after the tourism peak, he said, these boats had been ""sitting idle in the bay"" and it took them years just to make back the money they spent.
The message was clear, Palauan officials allege. They say that China had used its vast outbound tourism market as part of a broader campaign to try to peel Palau away from recognising Taiwan - and into Beijing's orbit.
The BBC reached out to China's foreign ministry for comment but has not received a response. China has, however, in the past repeatedly denied using tourism as political leverage.
Palau is one of only a dozen nations that still recognise Taiwan as a sovereign state. This challenges a key pillar of China's foreign policy, the ""one China principle"", in which Beijing asserts sovereignty over Taiwan.
But it's not just about a diplomatic tug of war.
Palau's location makes it a desirable target for influence from the world's biggest powers. It sits on the so-called ""Second Island Chain"" – a string of outposts the US sees as crucial to containing China's military expansion and responding to any aggression in the western Pacific.
Palau and the US have a long history of partnership: before its independence in 1994, Palau was a US-administered territory.
Under an agreement known as the Compact of Free Association, Palau gives the US exclusive military access in exchange for Washington's extensive aid, including Palauan citizens' ability to live and work freely in the US.
Working under the terms of the Compact, the US is now strengthening its own military footprint in the archipelago.
This geopolitical power struggle between China, Taiwan, and the US is cascading down into the daily lives of this tiny nation of fewer than 20,000 people.
""No matter what we do, Palau is going to be the centre of any military activity because of our location,"" Palau's President, Surangel Whipps Jr. told the BBC.
Palau's relationship with Taiwan runs deep.
When Palau became independent in 1994, Taiwan moved fast to secure a diplomatic ally, according to Cheng-Cheng Li, an assistant professor at National Dong Hwa University in Hualien, Taiwan, who has conducted extensive research on Taiwan-Palau relations.
Taiwan's assistance to it has been hands-on: agricultural experts working side by side with locals, medical teams in small clinics, funding for local entrepreneurs, and inviting students to Taiwan on scholarships.
For a country with a small population where community-based service plays a central role, Taiwan has been described as a ""reliable partner"" and a ""trusted friend"" by many Palauan officials.
Taiwan's ambassador to Palau, Jessica Lee, told the BBC that local leaders had assured her that the relationship was ""solid as a rock until death do us part.""
Still, Taiwan has reason to worry. In recent years, China has peeled away several of its former allies. In the Pacific region alone, the Solomon Islands, Kiribati, and Nauru have severed their diplomatic ties with it and switched to Beijing since 2019.
Beijing sees the democratically governed island of Taiwan as a breakaway province that will, eventually, be part of the country, and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve this.
Controlling Taiwan is essential to Chinese leader Xi Jinping's goal of reversing what he called China's ""century of humiliation"" by colonial powers, according to analysts.
""Both the US and Taiwan are paranoid and jumpy about Palau switching,"" said Graeme Smith, a senior fellow at the Australian National University. ""They'll put a lot of resources into making sure it doesn't happen.""
Officials in both Palau and Taiwan say Beijing has pulled on a range of levers to influence Palau's diplomatic position.
After he took office in 2021, Palau's president publicly claimed that China offered ""a million"" tourists in exchange for Palau to this end. He refused.
Then in 2024, China's foreign ministry issued a safety alert, advising Chinese nationals to ""exercise caution"" when travelling to Palau.
""If China uses tourism as a weapon, then it's an unstable market that we shouldn't depend on,"" President Whipps Jr. told the BBC. ""If China wants a relationship with Palau, they can, but they cannot tell us we cannot have a relationship with Taiwan.""
China, however, denies using tourism as a political tool.
In an opinion published last year in the People's Daily, the mouthpiece of the ruling Communist party, the paper stated that China's intention when issuing the alert was to protect its overseas citizens in light of the ""increasing public security cases in Palau"". It added that the accusations from the president were an attempt to smear China and interfere in its domestic affairs.
When asked in 2017 about the banning of tour groups, China's foreign ministry spokesperson said that he ""had not heard about the situation"".
But in 2024, responding to Palau's continued recognition of Taiwan, the ministry urged Palau to ""make the correct decisions that conform to their own... interests"".
Whilst China has not commented on the alleged offer of a million tourists, not everyone agrees with President Whipps Jr.'s assessment. Many locals who spoke with the BBC don't share the president's view on tourism.
""He's very hawkish towards China,"" said Pai Lee, the Taiwanese owner of a hotel in Koror. ""I don't think it's correct to say that China 'weaponised' tourism – they are simply using this as a bargaining chip, just like how people play chess and countries do it all the time.""
In any case, the legacy of the sudden tourism swing remains visible.
The economic shock after the suspension of tour groups  was sharp, but so was the environmental toll of the sudden influx of tourists itself. Palau, according to environmental protection organisations, was not ready for mass tourism.
""After the end of the explosion of Chinese tourism, I went there and the corals were dead,"" said Ann Singeo, director of the Ebiil Society, a local NGO.
""You'd see [hundreds of] people in this little cove, all standing on corals. That was the price we paid because we didn't have rules in place to use these resources respectfully.""
Tourism is just one part of China's alleged playbook. Beijing has also been trying to strengthen relationships with local leaders: Palauan officials say they have repeatedly been invited to Beijing for visits.
On one such visit, a former Palauan governor said he asked why Taiwan couldn't become independent.
""Taiwan is part of China"", replied a Chinese Communist Party official, looking furious.
With China's intensifying military activities around Taiwan, including air and sea patrols, the US has claimed that China is readying its military to be capable of invading it.
To contain China's potential aggression towards Taiwan and overall military activities in the western Pacific, the US has ramped up its own military infrastructure buildup in Palau.
Over the years, Washington has been upgrading airstrips, building Tactical Multi-Mission Over-the-horizon Radar system (Tacmor) used to monitor military activities in the Pacific, and planning on expanding Malakal Harbour, Palau's main port, to accommodate larger military vessels.
However, the US has expressed concern over a particular vulnerability: land acquisition.
Documents seen by the BBC show that several Chinese businesses have leased land and developed properties close to these sites, from undeveloped land to hotels overlooking the harbour and Palau's main airport.
In Angaur, a southern state of Palau, for example, the US is now building the receiver site of Tacmor – the plan was announced in 2017. However, in 2019 and 2020, Chinese investors leased land covering over 350,000 square metres following the announcement of radar construction.
One investor, Zhuang Cizhong, proposed building a resort there.
""We went to visit his company in China, and he laid out a plan for a retirement home for rich Chinese,"" said the former governor of Angaur, Marvin Ngirutang, who believes Palau's government should work more closely with China. ""There were booklets of blueprints – it looked legitimate.""
The project was never built. Zhuang blamed Covid-19, but Washington remains wary. The US ambassador in Palau could not be reached for comment, but he has previously voiced his concerns.
""All around there are various plots of land now leased to Chinese interests,"" US ambassador Joel Ehrendreich told Reuters. ""I don't think it's any coincidence that it happens to be physically close to our projects.""
Such worries are shared locally.
""The concern is that these investments or leases are not legitimate businesses,"" said Jennifer Anson, Palau's national security advisor. ""Maybe on the outside, but when the time comes that China invades Taiwan, these could be transformed into military sites.""
Chinese media reports, however, suggest that there were legitimate reasons to push for businesses to invest in Palau. In 2019, Phoenix News, a state-affiliated broadcaster, extolled the virtues of buying property in Palau, citing abundant tourism resources and relaxed legislation.
The BBC is unable to contact Zhuang. China's foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment on matters related to land leases.
Chinese-linked organised crime has also proliferated since 2018, according to authorities in Palau. President Whipps Jr. said that there was a ""constant battle going on"" as he pointed to crimes linked to China, including scamming, illegal casinos, and cyberattacks.
Some officials claim criminals have exploited the lack of diplomatic ties between China and Palau.
Wan Kuok Koi, known as ""Broken Tooth,"" who led the infamous Macau-based 14k triad, for example, entered Palau as a foreign investor in 2018. The crime syndicate later engaged in bribery, corruption and online gambling in countries including Palau.
Additionally, in 2025, the US Treasury sanctioned several individuals in Palau for their links to the Prince Group, a Chinese-run conglomerate. The group has been accused of scamming, money laundering, industrial-scale human trafficking, among other crimes.
Prince Group did not respond to the BBC's request for comment, but has previously ""categorically"" denied having engaged in ""any unlawful activity,"" according to the company's statement following the US sanction.
Many of these individuals have been placed on Palau's own ""undesirable alien list"", and according to Ms. Anson from Palau's national security office, they are banking on China's inability to hunt them down because of the lack of diplomatic relations.
""When you trawl Chinese diaspora sites in Cambodia, where the wisdom of relocating to Palau is sometimes debated, the criminals themselves are drawn by the lack of PRC diplomatic presence there,"" said ANU's Graeme Smith.
For many Palauans, talk of high-level geopolitical struggle feels distant, yet its ripples are everywhere. The US military expansion, Chinese investment, and rumours of hidden agendas feed a growing sense of unease.
""This administration is very hawkish towards China, and I think it's ridiculous,"" said the former governor of Angaur, who opposes the construction of Tacmor. ""We should concentrate on the environment and less on China-US relations"".
A petition circulating in recent months asks Washington to spell out its contingency plans in the event of war – a sign of how deep the anxiety runs. It calls on the US to ""reassure the people of Palau"" that civilians will be protected if conflict was o break out.
""We know what the geopolitics looks like between China and the US,"" said one resident. ""And we are scared our island will be destroyed by a war we don't want to be part of"".

54,2025-11-24,"The best part about this deal is that you don't need to wait until Black Friday.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

While Lenovo might've beaten Acer to the punch by releasing a Kompanio Ultra-powered Chromebook, the Chromebook Plus Spin 514 has one key feature that Lenovo's offering doesn't. Instead of sticking to the traditional laptop form factor, Acer's latest Chromebook sports a convertible design, making it much more versatile. This makes for a compelling reason to choose the Spin 514, and now, it's on sale for $100 off over at Best Buy.
This deal is available as part of Best Buy's early Black Friday promotion, of which we've already seen quite a few Chromebooks discounted. But saving $100 on the Spin 514 is particularly exciting, not just because it's one of Acer's latest offerings, but also because it's the first time that this Chromebook has gone on sale.
Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 514: $699 $599 at Best Buy
For many, the ideal Chromebook provides all-day battery life, a bright and vibrant screen, and a convertible design, all while being powerful enough to handle a multitude of tasks. The Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 514 checks pretty much all of the boxes here, and is currently on sale for $100 off.
✅Recommended if: You're in the market for a Chromebook that is both powerful and offers truly all-day battery life, while offering the added benefit of being a convertible.
❌Skip this deal if: You want a Chromebook that features a better selection of ports, such as an HDMI port, without needing to rely on external solutions.
Part of what makes this Chromebook special is that it's powered by the Kompanio Ultra processor, one of the best chips we've seen come from MediaTek. It basically provides the ""dream"" scenario for potential Chromebook buyers, as this chip is powerful enough to handle heavy multi-tasking, along with supporting more on-device AI features and functionality.
At the same time, Acer understands how important versatility is when it comes to getting a new Chromebook, and the Spin 514 delivers here, too. The convertible design lets you use this Chromebook in a variety of different ways, such as folding the screen back and using your favorite USI pen to take notes, draw, or even just play games without the keyboard getting in the way.
Many Chromebooks manage to check off those two boxes, but are often at the mercy of subpar or disappointing battery life. That's not an issue with the Spin 514, as this beast is rated to last for up to a whopping 17 hours of battery life on a single charge. It doesn't get much better than that.

If you’re in the U.S. or Canada and have been patiently eyeing something beyond cookie-cutter mid-range phones, the announcement of the OnePlus 15R is promising — and you also get the bonus of the OnePlus Pad Go 2, which, for the first time in this budget-tablet line, comes with a proper stylus.
The OnePlus 15R is being positioned as a “value flagship” in the U.S. and Canada markets. The initial specs whispers point to a Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, up to 16GB of RAM, 1 TB storage, and a dual-lens camera setup (50 MP + 8 MP) similar to the Chinese OnePlus Ace 6 model.
You get a redesigned body with a flat metal mid-frame and a camera module rotated exactly 45 degrees off the top-left corner. More importantly, the phone carries a stack of durability ratings you almost never see on a midrange device: IP66, IP68, IP69, and IP69K. These are the same IP ratings you see on the OnePlus 15.
Color options stay pretty safe with Charcoal Black and Mint Breeze. The 15R is expected to follow the OnePlus 15 pattern but drop in at a lower price point.
 



On the tablet front, OnePlus upgrades its Go line with the OnePlus Pad Go 2, and for the first time, a built-in stylus (the Stylo) arrives. The official OnePlus press materials describe the Pad Go 2 as more than just a budget tablet: it’s got a sleek build (anti-glare glass finish) and, paired with the Stylo, targets productivity, creativity, note-taking — you name it.
It comes in a single Shadow Black colorway for users in the U.S. and Canada. However, in North America, the Pad Go 2 is Wi-Fi only (no 5G).
 



OnePlus did not reveal much about the integrated stylus, but the existing Stylo (sold separately) supports advanced input, including 16,000 levels of pressure sensitivity, vibration feedback to mimic a pen-and-paper feel, a touchpad built into the stylus for presentation controls, and document scrolling.

Google has faced multiple antitrust inquiries over the past few years, and in April 2025, U.S. District Court Judge Leonie Brinkema ruled that it has two illegal monopolies in the advertising technology business. Last week, the remedies trial in the case came to an end, and Brinkema will soon decide whether to order Google to sell off part of the ad tech business, including a breakup of Google Ad Manager.
The U.S. Department of Justice is trying to force a sale of Google's ad marketplace platform, AdX, as reported by Reuters. While the publication notes the federal judge overseeing the case said ""time is of the essence,"" she also acknowledged how Google's planned appeals could complicate things.
""The kind of request you are making most likely would not be as easily enforceable while an appeal is pending,"" Brinkema told the DOJ following closing arguments in the remedies trial.
Google not only sees a forced sale of part of its ad tech business as too extreme of a measure, it also is arguing it is technically impossible, according to a blog post. ""Testimony showed that the DOJ’s proposal to break up Google Ad Manager is unworkable and would create significant uncertainty and disruption for advertisers and publishers,"" wrote Le-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs, in the blog post.
We've said from the beginning that the DOJ's case ignores immense competition and dynamism of the ad tech market ... We'll continue to advocate for a resolution that addresses the Court's concerns without stifling the growth of American businesses that choose to use our tools to grow.
The company called various experts to testify as to how a breakup of Google's ad tech business could be impossible to implement. One expert, Google Professor Jason Nieh, said the decision would be a ""highly complicated software engineering undertaking, with … no guarantee of success.""
On the other hand, Matthew Huppert, the DOJ attorney, argued that the breakup would be the only way to achieve a ""brighter, more competitive future for the open web.""
Now, Brinkema will decide how to remedy Google's two illegal ad tech monopolies, considering the arguments from the company and the U.S. DOJ.

Dispatch 
Dispatch, AdHoc Studioâs superhero workplace comedy, is an indisputable hit. The team led by ex-Telltale devs has announced that the episodic adventure game has reached 2 million players as of this week, and has become a viral sensation for streamers and content creators. The gameâs success flies in the face of claims that narrative adventure games have gone out of style. So what does AdHoc hope the industry learns from its success? Conversely, what do they hope developers donât take away from it? These are some of the things we asked when we sat down with co-directors Dennis Lenart and Chris Rebbert.
According to Lenart, the simplest reason for the gameâs success is that âpeople still enjoy good narrative games.â Rebbert expanded upon this by pointing out that simplicity and ease of access have become so rare in games that something refreshingly straightforward like Dispatch is offering an experience many players want but often have a hard time finding in todayâs market.
âI play some free-to-play games and stuff like that, but I feel like I get on so many games now, and it’s like I have to download an update every time I get on, and I have to pay for any extra thing,â Rebbert said. âI think when we talk about our favorite games, we always talk about, âI just want a linear experience. I don’t want to come jump in and compete.â And not to say those experiences shouldn’t be available for those who enjoy them, but I feel like a lot of people would like to have experiences like this, where they can just jump in and have a personal singular or linear playthrough or whatever it might be that is uninhibited by microtransactions and stuff like that, you know.â
Rebbert also pointed to Dispatchâs consistent release schedule, which made each episode a weekly event for fans, in contrast with the old Telltale games or the early Life Is Strange games, which launched sporadically over several months. Dispatchâs regular cadence allowed AdHoc to own a few weeks of mindshare.
âI was talking to Natalie [Herman], our producer, about it yesterday, and it was just like, âHow often do you have, like, those moments of anticipation anymore, you know?ââ he added. âBecause most TV shows even get dumped on a streaming platform, and people watch them at their leisure. You don’t have this cultural anticipation in conversation; that was really nice. We were witnessing it more than participating in it. I got increasingly excited to jump on and watch streamers on those days. It was cool to see people get increasingly excited for the next drop. I haven’t seen, culturally, that happen in a long time, and it’s cool that it was successful.â
While it all worked out in the end, Lenart says that Dispatch felt like a gamble throughout its development. He thinks the teamâs belief in the project, despite outside insistence that single-player narrative adventures were a dying genre, helped them push through their doubts.
âThere were several points along the way where things [felt] destined to fall apart for this kind of game coming out in this specific time in this market,â Lenart said. âAt every step of the way, I feel like the team pulled together and just made something happen where we didn’t think it was possible to make it happen. So it is definitely a credit to everyone at the studio for continuing to believe in the project, from the early days when it was an idea that we didn’t know if anyone would like, except for us, all the way through the final details and the final push to get out into the world. So it’s, it is really gratifying to me to be able to see the team enjoy the success that the game is having and see the little details that they put in and contributed, called back in memes. Itâs just fun.â
On the other hand, itâs always possible that something will blow up and some C-suite executive will completely misread why it took off. For Dispatch, Rebbert and Lenart say they donât want people to aimlessly try to emulate the gameâs raunchy sense of humor. Rebbert says that nudity and curse words are not a silver bullet for success if theyâre not pulled off with âtaste and dramatic weight.â Lenart says that the more irreverent side of Dispatch came about later in development, and the original draft was much more reserved and comparable to The Office meets Ted Lasso.
âIn all of the stories that we classically tell as a team of collaborators, the scenes that are the most exciting to us are people sitting around a couch or a table talking,â Lenart said. âAll of the visual flair or some things that people might think are gratuitous, all of that is sort of flavoring that gets peppered in the story and the characters where they’re at in the moment. It’s not the thing we start with. I definitely think there are some IP out there that start with âHow do we get the crazy thing or the insane image? What’s going to be the shock value thing? Then let’s stitch that piece together into the story.â We’re the exact opposite.â
All eight episodes of Dispatch are available now on PC and PlayStation 5.

The duo recently did an interview with Emerson Collective founder Laurene Powell Jobs, providing insight into what they're working on. There's now an established hardware prototype, and while Altman and Ive didn't explain what it is in plain language, the interview has hints of its design and functionality.
Here are several ways that Altman and Ive described their AI hardware device:
Rumors have described the device that io is working on as an AI phone without a screen, a ""third core device"" after a MacBook and an iPhone that's unobtrusive and able to sit in a pocket or on a desk, an iPod Shuffle-sized device that's neck worn, and a pocket-sized gadget that's screen-free but contextually aware of your life with microphones and cameras. It is not any kind of wearable like glasses, a watch, or earbuds.
Ive and Altman expect to have a device ready to hit the market in less than two years from now. The full interview with Altman and Ive is worth watching to see the commentary in context.

When it comes to acronym overabundance, Nvidia's computer peripherals are a chief offender. We've already talked about what ""RTX"" means on an Nvidia graphics card — as well as what ""DLSS"" means on an Nvidia GPU — but if you've been looking into upgrading your stock GPU with a new Nvidia model, you may be wondering what ""VRAM"" refers to. The simple answer is ""video random-access memory,"" a type of memory used to store image data for a PC display.
You'll see those four letters pop up a lot when talking about graphics cards because VRAM is heavily tied to gaming performance. Modern PC titles rely on enormous amounts of visual data to render complex scenes in real time. Think polygon-based 3D subjects, texture layers, shaders, particle effects, and everything else that makes a digital world feel alive on screen. And the more VRAM your GPU has, the more efficient it will be at rendering high-resolution visuals without frame drop or stuttering.
Nvidia is a market leader for GPUs, but VRAM isn't exclusive to the brand — you'll find it on competitive graphics cards from the likes of AMD and Intel, too. There's plenty more to learn about VRAM, so let's dive deeper into the world of GPU circuitry.
The origins of VRAM can be traced back to 1980, when three IBM employees — Frederick Dill, Daniel Ling, and Richard Matick — invented the allocated memory for use in a high-resolution graphics adapter for the RISC Technology Personal Computer (RT PC). A type of dynamic memory (DRAM) that acts as a bridge between the CPU and display, VRAM transmits data to a monitor using connections like HDMI and VGA. 
Most modern GPUs use a class of VRAM known as Graphics Double Data Rate, sixth-generation, or GDDR6 as it's more commonly known. Built for heavy graphics workloads, GDDR6-class VRAM is all about bandwidth. It doesn't worry much about saving power or keeping clock speeds modest — it's designed to blast enormous chunks of visual data to the GPU as fast as possible. When a modern game is cranked to Ultra settings and still looks stunning while running smoothly, there's a good chance GDDR6 is the memory making sure all those textures, lighting effects, and shader passes show up exactly when they're needed. 
So, how much VRAM does one need exactly? That all depends on what you're tasking your GPU with. If you're more about browsing the web, watching HD videos, and light gaming now and then, 4 to 8GB should more than do the trick. But if you're planning on taking advantage of 4K visuals for gaming or graphics-focused projects, you should have at least 16GB of VRAM, or more.
GPU tech moves fast, and we're already seeing companies like Nvidia release graphics cards built on GDDR7 memory. This new generation of VRAM boosts bandwidth for even cleaner, more detailed visuals, while also powering the latest wave of AI-assisted image tuning and performance optimization. But for now, GDDR6 remains the most widely used form of VRAM, and current mainstream GPUs — like AMD's Radeon RX 9070 —show just how capable this memory standard remains when it comes to delivering smooth, high-resolution gameplay. 
Still, it probably won't be much longer until GDDR7 rules the roost. The TL;DR on all this VRAM conversation: Without VRAM, PC games and graphics-oriented software would run pretty poorly. Without enough VRAM, your system RAM has to pick up the slack, and that employee isn't as well-trained at delivering big batches of bytes quickly. When today's PC games are firing on all cylinders, the results can look stunning, and VRAM is essential to delivering that level of performance and visual fidelity. Want to unpack another acronym with us? Check out our explainer on what ""FG"" or ""MFG"" on an Nvidia graphics card actually means."

Dancing is fun, but it’s even more enjoyable when you’re doing it with friends and scoring some points for it. The 2026 edition of Just Dance for Nintendo Switch is here, and we’ve already found a way to grab it for less.
Amazon has kick-started its Black Friday and Cyber Monday celebrations already, and is now offering tons of early discounts on a range of categories. The retailer is also offering plenty of top-rated consoles, plus their games for less! The 2026 Limited Edition of Just Dance is currently going for just $30, after a massive 40% discount on its retail price of $50. It’s the lowest price the game has dropped to in the last 30 days, and honestly, we don’t expect it to go down any further during the main event.
It’s open to all shoppers, whether you’re a Prime member or not, but it’s selling out fast. It’s better to get your orders in before the deal expires or the stock runs out. Because once it does, it might not even come back for Black Friday or Cyber Monday.
See at Amazon
Just Dance has truly come a long way. It’s the 17th installment in the main series which just keeps getting better. The case contains a digital download code instead of a game cartridge or disc, which you need to redeem online to get started. You will need a stable internet connection, a Ubisoft account, an applicable console account, and your platform’s specific subscription service to proceed.
The game even comes with a 1-month subscription to Just Dance+ that lets you access hundreds of songs for free! You can also access all the content you may already own from the 2023, 2024, 2025, or 2026 Editions of Just Dance, along with your Music Packs, so there’s plenty to browse.
This limited edition of the game gets you 40 exciting new tracks that include both the hottest hits to some classics. We’re talking “APT” by ROSE & Bruno Mars, “Houdini” by Dua Lipa, “I Had Some Help” by Post Malone feat. Morgan Wallen, “Counting Stars”â¯by OneRepublic, “Moonlight” by Aileen-O, “Hung Up” by Madonna, “All Star” by Smash Mouth, and many more. Basically, there’s something for everyone. You can also create custom playlists if you’re not a fan of experimenting and only want to stick to your favorites.
There are different playing modes to choose from, including Party Mode for a blast, Challenge Mode to show everyone who’s got the best moves, and Workout mode to burn some calories. Local multiplayer lets you dance with up to 6 players at a time. You can team up with friends or compete with them in an energy-packed match.
The game also lets you customize your Dancer card through the “Locked Room” menu, as well as your emotes, scoring effects, and victory celebrations.
Altogether, if you’ve been looking to add an exciting, energy-packed game to your mix, this Limited Edition of Just Dance 2026 is a great option to consider. You can team up with friends, compete against them, and even play alone if you don’t want anyone else copying your cool moves.
The current offer brings the price down to just $30, after a whopping 40% off its retail price. There’s a digital code version available for $50, too, but it’s not discounted at the moment. We’re not expecting this deal to stay around for long either, so it’s best to get your orders in as soon as you can.
Prime members will also enjoy free delivery on their purchase, so they’re saving a good chunk on that front too.

Black Friday and Cyber Monday are just a few days away. It’s more of a week-long celebration at this point, which is a good thing. You can score steep discounts on a range of categories, whether you’re looking to grab a new TV, upgrade to the latest iPad, or bag a few outdoor essentials for less. Best of all? You don’t really have to wait for the main event to start saving. Plenty of early deals are coming in hot, and we’re already spotting a ton of top-rated items dropping to their lowest ever prices!
Those looking to give their entertainment setup a boost on a budget should consider snagging the latest Roku Streaming Stick Plus. It normally retails for $40, which is already quite affordable, but this BF deal brings the price down to just $19, after a whopping 52% discount. The offer is open to both Prime and non-Prime users, but it’s selling out fast. If you have been after an affordable, no-fuss streaming solution, now is the time to act.
Just be sure to get your orders in fast, because the stock is likely going to end soon.

This tiny but might stick punches well above its weight. The sleek design is easy to carry around, plus it doesn’t block neighboring HDMI ports.
Roku Streaming Stick Plus brings all your favorite content apps in one place. Think Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Disney, Apple TV, and more. Basically, you’re never going to run out of content to watch, but note that these require subscriptions. Looking to cut back on those? There are over 500 live TV channels packed in, as well. These include live news, weather, sports, etc. Want to keep an eye on what’s happening around the world? Possible. Need to see how your favorite team or league did today? Access to live and upcoming games-plus highlights and documentaries, makes that easy. Automatic updates are included as well, so you’re always going to enjoy the latest features.
Content is pushed in 4K with vivid HDR color and brighter details. The home screen is easy to navigate, and you can customize it based on your content preferences. Even better, the included remote features app shortcuts for Netflix, Disney, Prime Video, and Apple TV, meaning you launch these with just a single push. Not in the mood to use the remote? Hit the microphone button, and use your voice to manage your screen. It also plays nicely with a range of smart voice assistants, so you can say something like “Alexa, show me the latest crime thrillers on the living room Roku”. You’ll have an entire list to browse even before the popcorns are ready.
The stick also supports Bluetooth Headphone mode. With this, you can pick your preferred audio device directly on your Roku Streaming Stick Plus and start streaming solo; great for late-night sessions where you don’t want to wake the entire house up.
Getting started is fairly straightforward. All that you need to do is plug it in, select the right TV input, pair the remote, and follow the on-screen instructions to set everything up. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes, even if it’s your first time using a streaming stick! And since it’s quite portable, you can literally take your entertainment setup anywhere in the world with you.
There’s a lot more to appreciate about this latest Roku streaming stick. It not just packs a ton of content options for you, but also makes navigating and browsing a breeze. It’s now available for less than $20, which is a steal considering all the features you’re getting.

Investors are warming up to exchange-traded funds, so much so that many fundholders say they’re on the way to portfolios 100% loaded with ETFs.
That’s the takeaway from a new Schwab Asset Management study that concludes 62% of ETF investors “envision putting their entire investment portfolios into ETFs, with 50% saying they could be fully invested in ETFs in the next five years.”
That could be a leading-edge issue on the consumer investment front, as 66% of ETF investors included in Schwab Asset Management’s survey say they started investing in ETFs within the past five years. Most also say they’re drawn to ETFs for their low costs and ease of access, Schwab added.
While nobody is saying ETFs will eliminate stocks, a market scenario in which investors shift to ETF-only portfolios would give Wall Street a vastly different look, at least among investors who represent the financial markets’ future.
“I absolutely believe the results of this study, particularly for younger investors,” said Asher Rogovy, chief investment officer at Magnifina, LLC in New York City.
Rogovy said he’s met many investors who think that individual stock investing involves catching a meme stock or picking the next NVDA. “These are games that many investors don't want to play,” he noted. “Few understand that good investing can mean picking 20-30 individual stocks that will simply perform better than average, or provide more stability.”
That’s just for starters. Market mavens point to multiple reasons why investors, especially the under 40-set, are turning to funds over individual stocks.
In a chaotic economic and political environment, many investors view the stock market as highly risky. “A lot of investors are fearful,” Rogovy noted. “We hear countless stories about single stock crashes and people losing too much with a risky bet; in movies, on Reddit, on social media, and the news.”
What investors rarely see are stories of successful, diligent long-term investing. “Warren Buffett is an exception, and his approach is often held up as an example of the right way to invest in stocks,” Rogovy added. “While he’s  generous in sharing his knowledge, Buffett’s advice is for novice investors to use index funds.”
On Main Street, just like Wall Street, time is a commodity, and the sooner regular investors can arrive at a portfolio decision, the better.
“In today’s world, time is probably the one commodity working people view as in short supply,” said Max Linnginton, co-founder at EPSMomentum, a New York City-based stock market analytics company. “Individual security selection takes a considerable amount of time and expertise.”
That reality often leads regular investors to financial media, publications, and AI, which can elevate everyone’s knowledge. 
“Even so, relying upon your favorite pundit, finfluencer, or AI LLM can lead to some questionable results,” Linnginton said. “As a result, the use of ETFs can replace the need for a finance degree, spread the risk of holding individual stocks, and provide today’s investors with a good level of confidence. After all, who wants to store gold bars if exposure to the commodity can be acquired through an ETF?”
Generally, when describing the essence of ETFs, stock market experts agree with the “low-cost building blocks and a flexible entry point” idea.
“In recent years, it’s unquestionable that ETFs have grown to the scale of a separate, self-contained investment mechanism,” said Arthur Azizov, founder and investor at Dubai-based B2 Ventures. “There are thousands of ETFs listed on Nasdaq.""
ETFs don't just allow Main Street investors to gain exposure to any investment idea quickly. “They also let us short individual sectors, regional markets, and leverage our favorite stories to double down on what we believe in, knowingly or religiously,” Azizov said. “Moreover, they can offer the following trade signals of great investors like Warren Buffett or Cathie Wood.”
Market experts say it’s possible, yet realistically unlikely, that investors will end up in an ETF-only world.
“Should it hypothetically become reality, the impact on market structure would be immense,” Linnginton said, and he lays out multiple potential outcomes.
Overall, an ETF and the ever-evolving industry have unquestionably experienced tremendous growth, but that likely isn’t enough for what investors really need. 
“Single-stock investing has its attractions in terms of risk and reward, investor empowerment, choice, sentimentality, the thrill of ownership, and many other reasons that appeal to the different types of investors,” Linnington added.
Investors who opt for an ETF-only portfolio still need to do their own research and maintain a balanced investment experience.
“Know what’s inside the bundle,” Azizov said. “Some ETFs are heavy on a few tech giants; others spread the risk more evenly; and the third group would provide an integrated hedge which protects the downside but limits the upside.”
That means checking the fine points before making the big jump into ETFs.
“If it suits your strategy, go with a mix of broad market funds with sector or thematic plays, but don’t chase every shiny new launch,” Azizov noted.  
It’s also worth remembering that ETFs are not the whole story, as bonds, FX, crypto, cash, and alternatives still matter. “Still, seeking exposure to them via relevant ETFs might be an option,” he added. “In any case, diversification across asset classes is the only real safety net.”
Not so long ago, ETFs launched as investment building blocks, and now they’re turning into the all-inclusive asset class. “Even though the ETF-only might be a bit of hype, one thing is clear: Investors are leaning hard into the ETF story, and the market will have to adjust to this growing popular theme,” Azizov said. "

The next generation of consoles wonât be cheap by todayâs standards, and neither will Valveâs hotly anticipated Steam Machine. The little, cube-shaped console is a bundle of PC parts inside a box, and Valve reps have consistently said it may demand PC-like prices. Considering the cost of those individual components, what that means for the price could be drastically different just a few months from now.
Valve has not given any official word regarding price or release date for its PC/console hybrid device. In an email with Gizmodo, Valve hinted it could arrive early next year. The roughly 6 x 6-inch box with a small LED light bar houses a âsemi-customâ AMD chip with the option for changing out RAM or SSD storage. The console uses Valveâs own SteamOS with its clean interface to let you access games or settings. Itâs otherwise using component PC parts, which makes sense considering Valve has long been a brand focused on the PC market. However, Valve has consistently implied this may demand PC-level pricing.
In a video interview with the YouTube channel Skill Up, Valve software engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais implied that the Steam Machine would not be âsubsidized,â as in Valve does not intend to help absorb some of the cost to make it more competitive with todayâs console market.
“Itâs more in line with what you might expect from the current PC market,” said Griffais. “Obviously, our goal is for it to be a good deal at that level of performance.â
Griffais added that there’s very little on the PC market that exists currently that offers an easy living room experience, one that lets you boot up and navigate the console with just a controller.
 
That line about price is consistent with what Valve told The Verge, that it will essentially be equivalent to a PC of similar specs. So what does that mean? If the Steam Machine is based on PC parts without any subsidies, that means it probably wonât cost $500 or $550, the current price of Valveâs Steam Deck or a Sony PlayStation 5 (after price hikes).
A Steam Machine houses a GPU on par with the mobile version of the AMD Radeon RX 7600, though with a higher thermal design power (TDP), which can potentially boost graphics performance. In trying to estimate how much the Steam Machine might cost, IGN cited devices like the MSI Thin B13VF, a near-$800 gaming laptop with a Core i5-13420H CPU, 16GB of RAM, 512GB SSD, and a discrete Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 GPU.
But there are so many other factors to consider, especially since a laptopâs cost includes the display and keyboard. Though if Valve truly doesnât intend to subsidize the Steam Machineâs cost, that would require making room for the skyrocketing price of memory across the board. The Steam Machine is notoriously using 8GB of VRAM on its GPUâwhich may not be exactly what you want for playing the most intensive games at 4Kâbut it has 16GB of DDR5 RAM and options for 512GB or 1TB of SSD storage.
RAM prices have doubled or tripled over just two months, mainly due to demand from AI data centers. Unless Valve has stockpiled a boatload of RAM to stuff into Steam Machines, the rising cost of RAM sticks could further add to the console’s pricing.
Griffais added that the Steam Machine is quiet and powerful despite its size. Plus, it comes with integrated Bluetooth and wireless with four antennas for four separate controllers. When you consider the size of the consoleâitâs practically half the size of an Xbox Series Xâthe Steam Machine is pretty powerful, though aÂ $750 PS5 Pro still has the upper hand. Still, Valve told Adam Savageâs Tested that the âGabeCubeâ (a portmanteau of Valve CEO Gabe Newell and the Nintendo GameCube) will âoutperform 70% of current gaming PCs.â
How the Steam Machine performs next to PCs matters far less than how it compares to todayâs consoles, even though theyâre getting more expensive every year. There are multiple signs that the next-generation Xbox could be significantly more powerful than todayâs 5-year-old Xbox Series X, and that means it could demand a price around $1,000. Sure, thatâs cheap for a gaming PC, but it isnât what console gamers expect. The rumored PS6 may end up costing less than its counterparts, but if memory prices keep on their trend, Sony’s next-gen console could also be costly. Valve may have 2026 all to itself for new hardware, but eventually it will have new competition.
The Steam Machine may simply be a blueprint for other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to make their own SteamOS-based consoles at varying price points. We’ve seen this happen with the Steam Deck. However, while tons of OEMs such as Lenovo have put out handheld PCs like the Legion Go S, none of them have really competed on pricing. All of them have swum upstream with more powerful hardware that costs more, so we wouldn’t be surprised if OEMs can’t (or won’t) push the price down from what Valve prices the Steam Machine at.
If we really want a console that can push gamers to jump for Steam (or Windows on Xbox, for that matter), it needs to be something console gamers can afford.

76,2025-11-24,"The latest collaboration between Emma Stone and director Yorgos Lanthimos, which released in theaters on October 24 of this year, is now heading to premium video on demand.
Starting on Tuesday, November 25, 2025, you'll be able to buy or rent ""Bugonia"" on major PVOD platforms, with a Blu-ray and DVD release to follow on December 23 (just in time for the holidays, if you need to get a gift for one of your decidedly offbeat friends or loved ones). Written by Will Tracy, who worked on ""Succession"" and ""The Menu"" and is also the former editor in chief of the satirical publication The Onion, ""Bugonia"" introduces us to Stone's Michelle Fuller, an CEO who runs a massive pharmaceutical company called Auxolith. When two men who feel wronged by Auxolith — Teddy Gatz (Jesse Plemons, who previously worked with Stone and Lanthimos on ""Kinds of Kindness"") and his cousin Don (Aidan Delbis, making a truly astounding feature film debut) — kidnap Michelle, things take a weirder turn than you could possibly expect.
I'll circle back to Lanthimos and Stone's wonderfully strange string of collaborations in depth shortly, but before I even get there, let me just say this: ""Bugonia"" is wild (complimentary). There's no question that Stone has become one of our most fearless and audacious performers, earning her rightful place in the history books, and this surprisingly massive yet intimate film lets her, Plemons, and Delbis really showcase their talents. Without getting into major spoiler territory, though, what exactly is ""Bugonia"" about?
When we first meet Michelle Fuller in ""Bugonia,"" she is, without question, what someone in the aughts and 2010s would unironically describe as a ""girlboss."" After waking up in her palatial, mostly glass mansion (indicating that, as a person of extreme means, she's offered endless freedom in a world propped up by capitalism), Michelle does yoga, kickboxing training, runs several miles, and glamorizes herself before heading into the Auxolith offices (with her red-soled and very expensive Christian Louboutin pumps on display, just to really drive the point home about her wealth). 
Despite running a company that, as we learn, has the power to cause active harm, Michelle enjoys the privileges of the very wealthy by building her fortune on the backs of others. If this was Teddy's sole reason for kidnapping her, audiences might understand; Teddy and Don live in a run-down, outdated house on the outskirts of town and are clearly barely scraping by even though Teddy works in one of the Auxolith fulfillment centers. The real reason that Teddy kidnaps Michelle, though, is a hell of a lot weirder.
Yes, Teddy is angry about Michelle's wealth and power and the generally imbalanced state of the world. There's another issue at play here, though: Teddy is irreversibly convinced that Michelle is a member of an alien race known as Andromedons, and he even eventually begins to believe that she's part of their royal family. By kidnapping her, shaving her hair (as he believes her hair is a communication device), and chaining her up in his basement, Teddy really, truly thinks he'll be able to make contact with her alien brethren, and he tortures her brutally to achieve this dubious goal. 
In 2018, Emma Stone and Yorgos Lanthimos worked on their first project together with ""The Favourite,"" the critically acclaimed hit directed by Lanthimos and written by Tony McNamara. Frankly, ""The Favourite"" is the most straightforward and least bizarre film to come from this partnership to date, in that it focuses loosely on a real historical individual — the tragic figure of England's Queen Anne, played by Oscar winner Olivia Colman — and, really, the ""weirdest"" thing about it is the fish-eye lense Lanthimos utilizes. Stone and Lanthimos then worked together again in 2022 on ""Bleat,"" a short film that's impossible to watch outside of honestly nonexistent screenings at this point (Lanthimos designed it to be viewed with a full orchestra), but then, in 2023, they collaborated once more for ""Poor Things.""
As Bella Baxter in ""Poor Things"" (which is an adaptation of the 1992 novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray), Stone quite literally gets to play with the entire human experience, beginning the film as a baby in an adult's body and eventually becoming a fully aware adult through a bizarre, unsettling, and often funny journey of self discovery. (Yeah, that journey involves a lot of sex.) Stone deservedly won her second Oscar for inhabiting the strangely relatable Bella, and one year later in ""Kinds of Kindness,"" she played multiple characters in Lanthimos' anthology film, showing off her range yet again.
My point here is that, through her collaborations with Lanthimos, Stone — who's always been reliably great — has become one of our boldest and most fascinating performers, willing to take on massive challenges thanks to her bond with this director. ""Bugonia"" is yet another example of that, so be sure to check it out."
77,2025-11-24,"When it comes to motorcycles, one might expect Harley-Davidson, an American icon, to be outselling all other brands in the United States, but the Milwaukee-based automaker isn't even selling the second most. The top-selling motorcycle manufacturer is none other than the maker of the 2025 Ninja 1100SX, Kawasaki, with Honda, another Japan-based automaker, trailing. A 14% Year-over-Year boost in sales catapulted Kawasaki ahead of Honda by the middle of 2025.
Honda is accustomed to leading the pack among major motorcycle brands and even posted outstanding numbers at the beginning of 2025, with a 3% uptick from last year, but it wasn't enough to outsell Kawasaki's green machines. By the time Honda lost its top position, its sales were down by 8%.
The Americas are the only two regions where Kawasaki is doing really well. On a global scale, the brand's sales have been down. In Southeast Asia, which makes up around 40% of Kawasaki's market, sales were down by roughly 15% for the first half of 2025. In Europe, on the other hand, it was only down about 1.5%.
Kawasaki's dirt bikes are a big draw in the competitive arena, but it was the brand's Ninja sportbike and Vulcan cruiser that put it ahead in U.S. sales. Kawasaki's Vulcan S is a favorite among beginners due to its smooth ride, easy handling, full adjustability to fit just about any rider of any height, and classic roadster look. For those a little more seasoned than beginner riders, there's the Vulcan 900, which has been a favorite for nearly 20 years.
The Ninja name is well-known even to non-riders, so it should be no surprise that the Ninja 400 has been the superstar for Kawasaki this past year. It's a common purchase for beginners and seasoned riders alike, and it makes for a good track bike thanks to its nimbleness. Though 600cc to 1000cc bikes don't see as much love as they once did, Kawasaki's ZX-6R put up good enough numbers to get a 2026 model, and if Kawasaki wants to maintain its standing, it's going to have to build on what has been working."

79,2025-11-24,"Seagate's pricey Storage Expansion Cards for Xbox are now on a Black Friday sale to give your precious Xbox Series X|S more space from 1TB to 4TB for less

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

There's no mistaking it that video games these days are getting so gluttonous for storage data that not even an Xbox Series X|S's default 1TB SSD is going to fit them all.
Luckily, Seagate's line-up of Storage Expansion Cards has received the biggest discount they've had in over a month to help alleviate these storage woes for less, with 1TB cards being sold for $119.99 at Amazon, 2TB cards for $199.99 at Amazon, and 4TB cards for $379.99 at Amazon.
This expansion card is an intuitive, plug-and-play device that adds more storage space to your Xbox Series X|S, allowing you to play games directly installed inside it.
This variant adds 2TB of storage for those drawn towards games that require hundreds of gigabytes' worth of storage space.
If you require the maximum amount of space possible to fit in all your favorite AAA, storage-hungry titles, then the 4TB variant of the Seagate Storage Expansion card is for you.
 



Now, there's no denying that the Seagate Storage Expansion Cards for Xbox are extremely expensive for what they are, with MSRPs ranging from $159.99 for the 1TB variant, $259.99 for the 2TB variant, and a gigantic $499.99 for the 4TB variant.
Despite the regular price, we still consider them some of the best Xbox accessories on the market.
We even gave them a high score of 4/5 stars in our review of the Seagate Storage Expansion Cards, with my former colleague, Matt Brown, stating, ""Seagate's Storage Expansion Card is the best way to add more space to the latest Xbox consoles, while avoiding the annoying limitations of USB drives. While it's an expensive investment that might be hard to justify, those who drop the cash won't be disappointed with the returns.""
I can vouch for him, as I own one of these cards, and it's been a massive boon to fit for Xbox Series X|S. Thanks to these cards, I was able to fit in titles that require dozens, if not hundreds, of gigabytes when combined with their DLC, like Monster Hunter World, Final Fantasy XVI, and WWE 2K25, without uninstalling a huge chunk of my game collection.
Another benefit of these SSD cards is that they allow an Xbox to run games directly from the cards without having to move them to the console's internal SSD, unlike external SSDs, saving me from hours of tedious file management.
So, if you're looking for the best storage devices for Xbox that are easy to use with tons of space to spare, then the Seagate Storage Expansion Cards are a no-brainer, especially now that they've some of the best Black Friday discounts for $119.99 at Amazon (1TB), $199.99 (2TB), and $379.99 (4TB) at Amazon.

Bose and Sonos watched nervously as Amazon entered the soundbar market after noticing the category’s massive sales potential. Amazon’s strategy was simple: create their own hardware and undercut premium brands on price while delivering competitive quality. The Fire TV Soundbar Plus represents this approach perfectly and packs 3.1 channels, a built-in subwoofer, Dolby Atmos, and DTS:X into a package that costs a fraction of comparable models.
At $149, down from $249, this newest model has hit an all-time low price on Amazon for Black Friday.
See at Amazon
The integrated subwoofer addresses the most significant compromise in budget soundbars by housing appropriate bass drivers within the main unit. You get deep, room-filling low-end without buying and placing a separate subwoofer box. Action movies provide satisfying rumble during explosions and car chases. Music playback maintains warmth and body across genres from hip-hop to rock.
The 3.1 configuration adds a dedicated center channel specifically for reproduction of dialogue. Conversations, narration, and vocal performances come through exceptionally well. You finally stop reaching for the remote when scenes switch between quiet talking and loud action. It also keeps your center channel focused on speech frequencies while left and right channels handle music and effects, which stops a muddy audio mix plaguing cheaper 2.0 soundbars.
Dolby Atmos support introduces 3D audio that flies around and above your listening position. Height virtualization bounces the sound off your ceiling to create overhead effects in movies and shows. Helicopters fly over your head, rain falls from above, and atmospheric sounds envelope you on all sides. DTS:X offers similarly multi-dimensional audio with somewhat different processing. Both transform your living room into a theater-like experience without needing to install ceiling speakers.
Setup takes only minutes via a single HDMI cable attached to the eARC or ARC port on your TV. Audio automatically stays perfectly synchronized with video over the HDMI connection. You avoid the lip-sync issues that plague budget setups with optical cable connections. Power the soundbar on, and your TV instantly recognizes it. The included HDMI cable means you do not need to invest in any more accessories.
It has four preset audio modes that automatically adjust the sound, depending on the content. Movie mode enhances dynamic range for cinematic experiences with deep bass and clear dialogue. Music mode balances frequencies to accurately reproduce your favorite songs and albums. Sports mode amplifies crowd noise and commentary for live events. Night mode compresses dynamic range so late-night viewing won’t disturb others.
The Amazon Fire TV Soundbar Plus delivers premium features at nearly half the retail price this Black Friday, priced at $149. Amazon actually made up the soundbar category to begin with specifically to provide better value than the established brands. If cinematic audio is what you need but want to avoid the premium prices, then this record-low deal proves that you don’t need to spend over $500 on a soundbar.

While EcoFlow, Anker and Jackery were all fairly aggressive in their Black Friday pricing on Amazon, only Anker provides 2,000W output at $349. Competitor power stations in the $350-$400 price range top out at 1,500-1,800W which gets you less power for similar money.
Amazon has just dropped the Anker SOLIX C1000 (second gen) to an all-time low of $349, down from its usual $449 price tag. You get 2,000W continuous output with 3,000W surge capacity, a 1,024Wh LiFePO4 battery lasting 10 years and it can recharge fully in just 49 minutes.
See at Amazon
The 2,000W continuous output handles high-draw appliances that kill weaker power stations instantly. You can power up space heaters, window air conditioners, power tools, electric kettles, and other demanding devices without triggering overload shutdowns. The 3,000W surge capacity absorbs the startup power spikes that motors and compressors create when they first kick on. Refrigerators, well pumps, and air compressors all draw massive current for a few seconds during startup, and this power station handles those surges without flinching.
Ten output ports spread the power across various devices at once, without having to prioritize what charges first. The port selection includes AC outlets for the standard household devices, USB-C with fast charging for phones and laptops, USB-A for the older gearÂ and a car outlet for the 12V accessories. You can power a full remote work setup with laptop, monitor, router, and phone charger while running a mini fridge and fan during power outages.
The 49-minute recharge time using HyperFlash technology at 1,600W input redefines how you use portable power stations. The traditional models take 6-10 hours to recharge from empty, creating overnight charging rituals which make the power station unavailable when you need it. This Anker charges over a lunch break or during a quick stop at an RV park and is ready for another full day of heavy use. You enable HyperFlash mode through the Anker app when you need maximum charging speed, or use standard charging for quieter operation.
LiFePO4 battery chemistry offers 10 years of reliable performance with 4,000 charge cycles before capacity drops to 80%. Traditional lithium-ion batteries degrade much faster; many lose a large portion of their capacity after 500-1,000 cycles. The longevity transforms this from a disposable gadget into a legitimate long-term investment that keeps working through years of regular use. The battery is much safer while charging and discharging than a standard lithium battery due to a lower risk of fire and higher thermal stability.
UPS functionality with under 10-millisecond switchover keeps sensitive equipment running during power transitions. CPAP machines, computers, modems, and medical devices never experience interruption when grid power fails. The power station detects outages and seamlessly takes over power delivery before the connected devices even notice anything happened.
At 14% smaller and 11% lighter than other 1,000Wh class products on the market, this compact unit makes transport and storage easier. You can also move it between rooms, load it into vehicles for camping, or stash it in closets without excessive effort.
This $349, 2,000W power station offers more output capacity and 49-minute recharging, while its usual price is $100 lower than the normal. Other competitors charge similar prices for less powerful 1,500-1,800W models with slower charging.

Roborock holds the same premium position in robot vacuums that Dyson commands in traditional vacuums, with flagship models regularly exceeding $1,500 to $2,000. These luxury cleaning machines pack technology that separates them from budget competitors flooding the market.
The good news is that Amazon just dropped one of Roborock’s best-sellers to an all-time low of $849 for Black Friday, nearly half off from its usual $1,499 price tag. The Qrevo CurvX delivers 22,000Pa suction, zero-tangling design, reactive AI obstacle recognition and 80Â°C hot water mop washing.
See at Amazon
The 22,000Pa HyperForce suction creates enough force to pull deeply embedded dirt from carpet pile and pulls debris from gaps in hardwood flooring. You can immediately tell the difference compared with a vacuum that has only 8,000-10,000Pa-suction power and tends to push dust instead of picking it up. Pet hair, long human hair up to 40cm, cereal crumbs, and tracked-in dirt-all get pulled into the dustbin in one pass. The zero-tangling design stops hair from tangling around the brushes, thus doing away with the maintenance nightmare of standard robot vacuums where you end up spending 15 minutes each week cutting tangled hair off rollers.
The ultra-slim profile, at only 3.14 inches, makes this the thinnest Roborock ever manufactured-just 7.98cm tall. This reduced height lets the robot glide under sofas, beds, and cabinets where dust bunnies really collect. Traditional robot vacuums with raised LiDAR domes get stuck or completely skip whole sections below furniture. This Roborock reaches those forgotten spaces and captures hidden dirt that ruins air quality even when visible floors appear clean.
Reactive AI obstacle recognition relies on structured light and an RGB camera to detect and avoid 108 different object types. It works both in bright and dark environments and navigates around toys, cables, pet bowls, shoes, and even furniture legs without getting stuck. You don’t have to preclean your floors before running the vacuum, which really changes the vacuum from a scheduled maintenance tool into something you can turn on spontaneously.
AdaptiLift Chassis is industry-first technology that can lift the entire robot up to 4cm or individually according to terrain. The system raises the front to climb high thresholds, adjusts side wheels to navigate around furniture legs, and lowers for tight clearances. This adaptability prevents the ‘stuck’ notifications which interrupt other robot vacuums in mid-clean.
The 80Â°C hot water washing of the mop dissolves stubborn stains and grease left by cold water. The dock heats water to 176Â°F before washing the mop pads to make sure they are thoroughly cleaned and sanitized after each use. Warm air drying at 113Â°F prevents mildew and odors from forming on damp mop pads. This focus on hygiene means your robot will never spread dirty water around on your floors in the course of subsequent cleaning.
The automated maintenance tasks handled by the Multifunctional Dock 3.0 Thermo+ mean you barely touch the robot. Auto dust emptying transfers collected debris to the dock’s larger bag, holding weeks of dirt. Auto tank refilling keeps the water reservoir full for mopping sessions. Intelligent dirt detection analyzes mop pad contamination and adjusts washing intensity accordingly. The dock performs self-cleaning with hot water, preventing the buildup that makes other docking stations smell terrible after a few weeks.
At $849, this Roborock delivers flagship cleaning technology and hot water mop washing for $650 off the usual price. You are getting premium features that normally would call for an outlay in excess of $1,500+, skimping on very few minor conveniences.

When Apple drops a new tech device to replace a top-rated favorite â say, the AirPods Pro 2 â the first questions are always “how much better can the new one be?” and “do I really need to upgrade?” In the case of the AirPods Pro 3, the answers are “aÂ lot” and “yes, absolutely.” The AirPods Pro 3 aren’t just Apple’s best active noise-cancelling in-ear buds, they’re the best ones made by anyone, anywhere, at any time. They’re also on sale for the very first time at Amazon for Black Friday, with an all-time low price of $220.
There’s definitely nothing wrong with the AirPods Pro 2. They’re still among the very best wireless earbuds on the market (and almost certainly the subject of some epic Black Friday deals of their own, especially now that the Pro 3s have arrived). But the Pro 3s are on a whole new level, from their sound and noise cancellation to their redesigned feel â more contoured, shorter stems, and a better overall fit. As much as we love the Pro 2s and didn’t think we’d be recommending an upgrade this soon, here we are.
See at Amazon
As long as the list of serious perks is for the AirPods Pro 3, we have to start with the active noise cancellation. It takes the formidable ANC of the Pro 2s and doubles it, creating the world’s best in-ear active noise cancellation. And now with as much of the outside world blocked out as you want, you can immerse yourself in the upgraded sound of the Pro 3s. Apple’s added a new acoustic architecture that really brings out the bass, but also the mids, vocals, and every facet of the music.
It’s also an improved Spatial Audio sound, which will have you turning your head to move the sound source over and over until you get used to just how realistic the effect is. And you can move your head or any other part of your body as much as you like with the AirPods Pro 3, because in addition to the more contoured design, they also come with five sets of ear tips to ensure a more secure fit. The AirPods were already great workout buds, but the better fit and the new heart-rate-sensing feature that links to the Move ring and step count on your iPhone, and also the Apple Intelligence-powered Workout Buddy feature.
Active Noise Cancellation is a notoriously greedy feature when it comes to battery life, but the AirPods Pro 3 give you 8 full hours of ANC listening time on a single charge, and 10 hours in Transparency mode, even if you engage the Hearing Aid feature that’s been carried over and enhanced from the AirPods Pro 2. The Hearing Aid feature now has automatic Conversation Boost and active Hearing Protection to safeguard your ears when the environment around you gets overly loud. (Think live sporting events or construction zones.)
If putting the brand-new AirPods Pro 3 on sale is Apple’s opening move for Black Friday and Cyber Week, it’s a sign of a truly epic holiday shopping season to come. This Amazon deal for $220 is the lowest price yet on the AirPods Pro 3, and they’re a worthy upgrade even from their famously great predecessors.

This summer, Amazon's cloud business struggled to keep pace with surging AI demand and missed out on real revenue for its flagship AI product.
Amazon Web Services's Bedrock service sits at the center of the company's AI push. It lets developers tap into powerful models, including Anthropic's Claude and Meta's Llama.
But over the summer, Bedrock hit ""critical capacity constraints"" that drove some customers to rival services, such as Google's cloud service, according to an internal July document obtained by Business Insider.
The shortages led to tens of millions of dollars in lost or delayed revenue. Epic Games shifted a $10 million Fortnite project to Google Cloud after AWS failed to provide enough quota for Bedrock, according to the document. (Quota limits control how much intelligence customers can access via AI cloud services).  
Oil trader Vitol weighed moving some projects away from AWS, a decision that risked a $3.5 million revenue hit amid ""prolonged quota approvals,"" the document also warned. Other customers, including Atlassian and GovTech Singapore, were waiting on quota increases this summer, delaying at least $52.6 million in projected sales, the document also disclosed.
Bedrock was ""experiencing critical capacity constraints that are threatening customer adoption and potentially causing substantial revenue loss across multiple industries,"" the July document stated.
The fallout underscores the financial toll of AWS's capacity crunch, and it explains why the biggest cloud companies are rushing to build as many AI data centers as possible right now. High demand is a good thing, but if you can't satisfy this and customers go to rivals, that's a frustrating problem. 
Indeed, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has repeatedly stressed the need to ramp up cloud infrastructure, particularly AI chips and data center power. It's unclear whether the company has fully resolved these issues. Three current and former employees said the capacity crunch remained one of AWS's top concerns through September.
An Amazon spokesperson said Bedrock is ""experiencing rapid growth"" and AWS is adding capacity to meet that demand. Reviewing customer feedback is a core part of Amazon's culture, which helps the company improve its products and services, the spokesperson added.
""At Amazon, we're vocally self-critical because that's how we drive continuous improvement and deliver better results for customers,"" the spokesperson said in a statement. ""This internal candor is a feature of our culture, not a flaw. We're grateful for all customer feedback—including challenges they encounter—because it helps us make Bedrock even better, and that's exactly how you build a scalable, sustainable business that serves customers well over the long term.""
A Google spokesperson declined to comment. Representatives for Anthropic and Epic Games didn't respond to requests for comment.
Expanding data center capacity, as with other cloud providers, is one of AWS's top priorities.
During an October earnings call, Jassy said AWS had been ""focused on accelerating capacity the last several months,"" adding more than 3.8 gigawatts of power over the past year, more than any other cloud provider. AWS has doubled its power capacity since 2022 and plans to double it again by 2027, he noted.
Jassy added that Amazon will remain ""very aggressive"" in scaling up capacity to meet booming demand, noting that AWS can monetize new infrastructure almost immediately. Bedrock, he said, is already showing potential to grow as large as EC2, one of AWS's most successful cloud products and a key profit engine.
Part of Bedrock's shortages may stem from prioritizing large clients. In October, Jassy said most of Bedrock's workloads run on AWS's in-house AI chip, Trainium, but that usage so far has come mainly from ""a small number of very large customers."" He added that more mid-sized companies are expected to adopt the next-generation Trainium in the coming months.
Amazon is expected to reveal more details about Bedrock and its broader cloud strategy during its annual re:Invent conference in early December.
The July AWS document said the capacity crunch was hitting customers across industries, including finance, gaming, and tech. Companies such as HelloFresh, Zalando, and Ryanair were among those affected.
At the same time, ""slow capacity approval and denial of spiky workload requests"" prevented firms like Stripe, Robinhood, and Vanguard from moving AI workloads from Anthropic to Bedrock, the document noted.
""These constraints are forcing customers to explore alternative providers like GCP, OpenAI, and Anthropic, signaling an urgent need for AWS to address its Bedrock service quota and performance challenges to maintain competitive positioning in the rapidly evolving GenAI market,"" the document stated.
Quota limits in Bedrock are based on how many AI tokens you can process in a minute, or the number of API calls you can make in a given time period. (Tokens are how AI models break queries down into digestible data chunks. Industry pricing is based on how many tokens are processed. APIs are application programming interfaces, a common way applications share data).
In recent weeks, investors have grown uneasy over the tech industry's massive AI spending, with fears of a potential bubble weighing on markets. 
Amazon's AI capacity issues are a double-edge sword here. On one hand, these challenges suggest customer demand is still very strong. On the other, it's another reason for big tech companies to keep spending heavily, potentially fueling the AI bubble even more. 
Amazon has said it plans to pour $125 billion into capital expenditures this year, and even more in 2026. AWS revenue climbed to $33 billion last quarter, up 20% year over year, marking its fastest growth since 2022.
It wasn't just capacity woes driving customer workloads away from Bedrock. Latency and missing features also played a major role.
Customers using Anthropic's Claude models through Bedrock opted to switch to Anthropic's own platform or Google Cloud because of ""ongoing capacity, latency, and feature parity issues,"" according to the July AWS document. Companies such as Figma, Intercom, and Wealthsimple were among those migrating their workloads ""due to one or several of these challenges.""
The UK's Government Digital Service considered a move to Microsoft's cloud because Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet model ran slower on Bedrock, the document added.
Thomson Reuters also chose Google Cloud over Bedrock for its CoCounsel AI product after finding AWS's service was 15% to 30% slower and lacked key government compliance certifications, the document showed. In May, executives raised these concerns with AWS leadership, including CEO Matt Garman and compute VP Dave Brown, leading both companies to agree to monthly review meetings.
Joel Hron, CTO of Thomson Reuters, told Business Insider that the company recently moved ""one component of an AI workload to Google Cloud to prioritize latency."" He added that Thomson Reuters still runs substantial workloads on AWS and Anthropic as part of its multi-model, multi-cloud strategy.
The July AWS document also noted that Bedrock was losing ground to Google's Gemini models, which boast five to six times larger quota limits and, in many cases, better performance.
When comparing accessing Claude via Bedrock against Gemini Pro, the internal report said the Google model outperformed ""across multiple benchmarks."" The document also noted that Gemini Flash, a smaller, cheaper Google model, ""delivers comparable quality at a fraction of the cost."" (And this was before Google's Gemini 3 launch, which improved AI performance further for the internet giant). 
Some startups jumped ship because of this. Financial startup TainAI shifted 40% of its Claude workloads from Bedrock to Gemini Flash, saving $85,000 a day, while Hotel Planner was planning to move to Google Cloud or OpenAI, the document noted.
The broader concern, according to the document, is that AWS lacked a cohesive product vision for AI inference, the main space in which Bedrock competes. Rivals such as Databricks, FireworksAI, and Nvidia's Dynamo were quickly pulling ahead, it noted.
Without a clear strategy or compelling long-term vision, AWS risked missing out on one of the most lucrative opportunities in the AI market, it warned.
""We are still missing an inspiring long-term vision and a holistic strategy,"" the document said.

90,2025-11-24,"Add substantial comfort and fun to your Meta Quest 3 or Quest 3S with these two Yoges accessories.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

If you've got a Meta Quest 3 or Quest 3S, you'll know that while these headsets are amazing in their own right, two things aren't the best out of the box: long-term comfort, and battery life. Thankfully, the Yoges battery headstrap fixes both of those problems in one fell swoop, and now at $36.09, making it $100 less than the official Meta Elite battery headstrap.
If you've only used the default cloth headstrap this entire time, you have no idea what you're missing. Not only does this Elite-style strap add a substantial amount of comfort due to its rigid construction and supple padding around the top and back of your head, but it's also unbelievably easy to adjust thanks to an ergonomic wheel at the back that loosens and tightens the strap with just a turn.
To make things even better, a rechargeable, magnetically attachable battery pack comes with the headset and can be popped on to triple the battery life of your Meta Quest headset. It charges via USB-C, so any charger you've got on hand should do the trick. It's the best of both worlds, and it's dirt cheap right now thanks to this early Black Friday deal.
Yoges 10000mAh battery headstrap: $59.99 $36.09 at Amazon
When it comes to Elite-style straps, you won't find one better than this Yoges battery headstrap. Not only does it feature supple, comfortable pads for your entire head along with an easily adjustable sizing wheel on the back, but a generous 10,000mAh battery pack magnetically attaches to the back, providing even weight distribution on your head and hours of additional play time for your Quest or Quest 3S
Price comparison: Yoges store - $59.99

✅Recommended if: You find the Meta Quest to be uncomfortable to wear for any amount of time, or you regularly find your headset running out of battery before you're done playing.
❌Skip this deal if: You prefer halo-style straps that move the weight to your forehead rather than your face. This Elite-style strap is a compression strap that's best for active gaming and tends to run tighter than halo-style straps.
Elite-style straps like this are the kind that distribute weight evenly on the top of your head, as well as your face and the back of the skull. Since this is a compression-style fit, it's best for active games like Beat Saber or Forefront, where you might be whipping your head around at high speeds to keep track of the action.
If you'd rather have a halo-style strap — the kind that distributes all the weight evenly across your forehead and the back of your head — grab this BoboVR M3 Pro strap for a discount of $39.99 instead.
Yoges adjustable length golf club: $29.99 $23.99 at Amazon
Love playing Walkabout Mini Golf, Golf+, or one of the other amazing golfing games on the Meta Quest? This adjustable-length golf club fits any player's height or swing style with an easy twist-to-adjust mechanism and rubber grips and weight that make it feel like the real thing.
Price comparison: Yoges store - $35.99
I'm a huge fan of VR golf games, and while they're good on their own, it feels so much more authentic when you add a golf club accessory to the mix. The Yoges adjustable golf club is the best option on the market today, and this excellent sale drops it to the lowest price I've ever seen.
If you haven't used a club like this before, you'll be immediately impressed with how it feels. The rubber grip looks and feels exactly like a real club, and the metal shaft continues the authenticity right down to the end where the controller attaches. This particular club connects to the built-in controller wrist straps to keep the controller from flying away when you swing, giving you confidence that you can hit without worry.
I recommend pairing it with an open facial interface (Quest 3 version or Quest 3S version) when you play, as these face pads give you an open periphery to see the room around you, helping prevent accidental collisions with furniture or other objects in your room.

South Korea’s biggest crypto exchange, Upbit, may be positioning for a potential Nasdaq IPO, following confirmation that tech giant Naver is preparing to acquire its parent company, Dunamu, in a landmark stock-swap merger.
The move, expected to be approved at board meetings next week, would create one of Asia’s most powerful fintech–crypto conglomerates and accelerate Korea’s entry into US capital markets.
Reports from Zoomer and Unfolded, citing Bloomberg, suggest that Upbit exchange could soon launch in the US via a Nasdaq IPO. 
[ ZOOMER ]RECENTLY ACQUIRED CRYPTO EXCHANGE UPBIT LOOKING FOR NASDAQ IPO AFTER MERGER: BBG
The announcement comes after reports that Naver Financial will acquire Dunamu through a KRW 20 trillion ($14.5 billion) stock exchange. This would make the Upbit operator a wholly owned subsidiary of the country’s dominant internet conglomerate. 
The merger would combine Naver’s fintech ecosystem with Upbit’s 70% share of domestic crypto trading, instantly creating a global-scale digital finance platform.
The union positions Upbit’s business under a politically safer, more globally recognizable corporate structure, one far more acceptable to Nasdaq regulators than a standalone crypto exchange.
Brokerage research indicates that the merged Naver–Upbit entity laid the groundwork for a potential Nasdaq IPO as early as 2026, depending on US market conditions. 
Local media reported industry disclosures, revealing that Naver Financial and Dunamu have decided to raise the exchange ratio and formally align the merger with a future Nasdaq listing commitment. 
Both companies will hold board meetings on Wednesday, November 26, to finalize the comprehensive stock swap. The updated ratio is expected to land at 1:3.3–3.4 in favor of Dunamu, higher than previously assumed.
“One senior industry source said “[the adjustment is meant] to actively reflect Dunamu’s corporate value and ensure a smooth integration between Naver and Dunamu,” local media reported, citing one senior industry source. 
The revised ratio acknowledges Dunamu’s significantly stronger performance metrics. As of end-2024, Dunamu posted KRW 1.186 trillion in operating profit, roughly 10× Naver Financial’s KRW 103.5 billion, alongside far larger asset holdings. 
Minority shareholders had expressed dissatisfaction with a “1:3” swap, arguing it undervalued the Upbit operator. The higher ratio is viewed internally as a compromise that enables both major shareholder groups to approve the deal.
Local media sources also confirm that the two companies have agreed to complete a Nasdaq listing within a defined period after the stock-swap, addressing concerns about double-listing conflicts since Naver Corporation is already publicly traded in Korea. 
While the IPO itself is not on the board’s agenda this week, the listing plan will be finalized once procedural steps are completed. 
The joint press conference scheduled for November 27 at Naver’s “1784” headquarters is expected to outline the merged entity’s long-term global expansion strategy.
Upbit’s global ambitions come as domestic rivals pursue their own public-market paths. Bithumb, Korea’s second-largest exchange, has reportedly regained nearly 25% of the market share and is preparing for the public market. 
Meanwhile, K Bank, Upbit’s main banking partner, was forced to pull its planned $700 million IPO last year amid alleged valuation concerns, intensifying scrutiny over Korean fintech listings.
In contrast, Upbit’s path to Wall Street appears strengthened by Naver’s backing. Merging with a big-tech brand reduces regulatory friction and offers “cover” for Dunamu’s long-delayed goal of a US listing.
If the merger proceeds as expected, South Korea may soon attempt what no major Asian crypto platform has achieved, a seat on Nasdaq, signaling a new chapter in the global crypto-fintech race.

Stanley Druckenmiller has been one of the most successful investors, a billionaire with a long record of high returns in global macro investing. He’s now piling into Natera (NASDAQ:NTRA), Insmed (NASDAQ:INSM), and Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA). They’re worth looking into, as Druckenmiller has an exceptional record.
In 1977, Druckenmiller started his financial career as an oil analyst and management trainee at Pittsburgh National Bank.​
Within about a year, he rose to become head of the bank’s equity research group, an early sign of his analytical skill and rapid advancement.​
In 1981, he left the bank to found his own investment firm, Duquesne Capital Management, which would become the main vehicle for his investing career.​ Druckenmiller’s reputation grew as he balanced running Duquesne with consulting work for the Dreyfus Corporation. By 1986, he was named head of the Dreyfus Fund while still managing Duquesne. Two years later, George Soros hired Druckenmiller as the lead portfolio manager for the Quantum Fund and a key manager at Soros Fund Management.
There, he helped engineer the 1992 trade against the British pound, “breaking the Bank of England” and reportedly earning over $1 billion in profit.
From 1981 to the fund’s closing in 2010, Druckenmiller produced average annual returns of around 30% with no losing years at Duquesne. He returned all outside investor money and shifted to managing only his own fortune thereafter. That doesn’t mean all his trades are now secrets. You can still get a glimpse of the stocks he is buying through the Duquesne Family Office LLC.
Natera is a genetic testing company. It specializes in using cell-free DNA (cfDNA) to provide diagnostic tests like non-invasive prenatal tests. NTRA stock has historically been quite volatile, but it has been on a terrific run since late 2023.
NTRA stock is up over 500% since its trough in October 2023. This rally is only accelerating with time as revenue surpasses analyst expectations. Revenue rose 34.66% year-over-year in Q3 2025 and beat analyst estimates by 13.9%. The quarter before, revenue beat estimates by 14.63%. Management also increased full-year guidance to $2.18 billion to $2.26 billion. This came after a guidance increase in Q2 2025 as well. The initial Q1 guidance was $240 million lower at the midpoint.
Druckenmiller has been backing up the truck here. He started accumulating NTRA stock in Q3 2022, Q4 2022, and Q1 2023. Once the stock started breaking out in early 2024, he bought again for three consecutive quarters from Q1 2024 to Q3 2024.
Druckenmiller then took profits in Q1 2025 and Q2 2025 as NTRA stock plateaued and declined by ~20% on certain occasions. He bought again in Q3 2025, likely during the dip. In Q3, he increased his shares by 4.2%, meaning now NTRA is his largest holding.
The average buy price is estimated to be $88.5, with the current value of his holding at $741 million.
Insmed is a biopharmaceutical company that makes drugs for serious and rare diseases, with a priority on lung conditions. The main business is getting therapies through clinical trials and regulatory approval, then commercializing them. Their first product received FDA accelerated approval back in 2018, and they’ve since launched in Europe and Japan.
Insmed is entering what analysts describe as a “milestone-rich” period with over 30 preclinical programs, Phase 3 and 2b studies advancing, and regulatory submissions planned for Europe, the UK, and Japan for BRINSUPRI. This is likely where Druckenmiller’s bullishness comes from.
INSM stock has been comparatively even more bullish than NTRA. The stock was below $26 in May 2024 but has since surged to nearly $200. Plus, Revenue grew 52.36% YOY in Q3 2025.
Druckenmiller first bought Insmed stock back in Q2 2020, selling almost all his holdings the next quarter at a profit. He made the right call as INSM stock shortly topped out and fell again. INSM stock was trading lower from January 2021 through March 2023, and it was rangebound up until May 2024. This is the exact same quarter (Q2 2024) that Druckenmiller bought back in big. He paused buying in Q3 2024 but has been buying every single quarter since Q4 2024.
He increased his stake in INSM stock by 7.5% in Q3 2025. It constitutes 11.77% of his portfolio now, valued at $482 million in total. The average buy price is estimated to be $74.83.
Teva Pharmaceuticals is an Israeli company that specializes in generic medications. It is the world’s largest generic drug manufacturer and makes over 350 active pharmaceutical ingredients both for its own use and for sale to third-party manufacturers.
Teva is well-established and not a burgeoning pharma startup, but it has been posting stellar numbers. TEVA stock ended a 15-year uptrend in late 2015 after it spent over $40 billion in an acquisition and was dealing with the loss of patent protection on a blockbuster drug.
TEVA stock declined from over $70 in the summer of 2015 and bottomed out in 2019. It traded rangebound, ~$7 to $11, before sharply recovering since September 2023.
Druckenmiller’s record here has been exceptional, too. He took profit and sold his TEVA stake in Q2 2015, months before the stock entered a freefall. He has only started buying in Q3 2024 and has added to his holdings every quarter since. He likely expects a full recovery.
Teva Pharmaceuticals constitutes 9.81% of his portfolio now and is worth $402 million. His average buy price is estimated at $17.9.

One of the biggest challenges for investors is recognizing exactly how little we know about what the future holds. It is a rare moment in market history when what comes next is extremely obvious to most investors.
A few examples – and feel free to push back on these – include the post-1987 crash, the peak Dotcom/Tech bubble in Q1 2000, the subprime mortgage boom and bust that led into the Great Financial Crisis, and the March 2009 lows.
Those examples may appear obvious in hindsight. But recall how few people bought in circa March and April 2009; by October, the move off the GFC lows was being called “The Most Hated Rally” in stock market history. Fast forward three years to 2012, and strategists were the most bearish they had been on equities since 1985.
Too many people fail to recognize how challenging it is to identify these generational market turning points in real time. This is important when groups of people declare future outcomes with both abundant confidence and a lack of humility.
Recall the now-infamous Fed Chair Alan Greenspan’s December 5, 1996 Irrational Exuberance speech. The market moved modestly upwards for another two years before exploding higher in late September 1998 (LTCM bailout), and then again in October 1999 (Pre-Y2K Fed liquidity injection).

 
With the benefit of hindsight, that now seems more like “Rational” than “Irrational” exuberance. The S&P500 gained 88.6%, but the more speculative Tech and Dotcom sectors, represented by the Nasdaq 100, gained an astonishing 454.5%.
Perhaps we are in the late stages of an AI-driven bubble; we could just as easily be in a once-in-a-generation transformational technology boom that will drive both the economy and the stock market in positive directions for years to come.
As my colleague Ben Carlson asked, “Is this 1996 or 1999?” I floated a broader question last month:
When was the last time the crowd, the media, or Wall Street accurately identified a bubble in real time?
By definition, it takes a crowd to drive prices to bubblicious levels. It is a challenge for the crowd to simultaneously speculate on a bubble and accurately identify one as it inflates.
See the Goldman Sachs’ chart of Forward P/E ratios by theme (at top). Some sectors are extremely overpriced—new IPOs and Meme stocks are trading at ridiculous forward earnings, mainly because they have very little or no profits. The S&P 493 — S&P 500 minus the Magnificent 7 — however, is not in bubble territory at 20.7 P/E. Pricey, yes, but bubblicious? Hardly.
Given the profit growth over the past few years (and expectations of lower interest rates), can investors rationally believe that prices are not entirely irrational?
Jurrien Timmer of Fidelity observes “Meme stocks have lost some 60 P/E points, while the big players (Mag 7) trade at a [more] reasonable 32.6x and the S&P 493 at 20.7x. For the large caps these are not bubble valuations.”
That is where we are today: A 15-year rally that was initially built on a market that was cut in half (2007-09), followed by a post-crash recovery that was helped along by zero-interest rate policy, leading into the pandemic, which itself was helped along by the single largest fiscal stimulus as a percentage of GDP since World War II. Today, we see AI driving a market that continues to post record earnings. There is enough rationality that a run-of-the-mill 5% pullback sends the VIX up to 25, with genuine fear amongst traders and policymakers.
The key question investors face is this:
Is Artificial Intelligence more like the internet on the economy, where it continues to boost economic activity and efficiencies long after its introduction? Or are we in a period of malinvestment and reckless speculation that leads to a bubble and a market crash? Both?
You can cherry-pick charts that show a bubble or not.
Consider this chart (via the Washington Post) of Nvidia’s revenues. $57 billion per quarter in revenue is nothing like what we saw among the DotComs in the late 1990s; note the Magnificent 7 collectively pull in more than $2 trillion annually in revenues.

 
But the next chart is the one that I found especially compelling: Will investments in AI payoff to the tune of $650 billion in revenues above current levels by 2030?

 
If you suspect you know the answer to that, you know how to deploy your capital. If you are confident you know the answer, the odds suggest you may be overplaying your hand…
