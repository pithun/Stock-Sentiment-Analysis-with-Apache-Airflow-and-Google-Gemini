Big Tech stocks have dipped recently on speculation that the peak is in and a correction in high-flying AI names is imminent.
Front and center for investors is a relatively recent concern that heavy borrowing among AI companies could worsen the fallout of a bubble if it does end up popping.  
Julian Emanuel, the equity strategy chief of Evercore ISI, agrees that high levels of debt have become a concern, particularly for those who remember the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s.
Emanuel told Bloomberg TV that, while he's still bullish on the sector, he thinks investors are rightly comparing the current era of AI spending to the internet craze of 2000. 
""When you think about the late 1990s, the problem with the bursting of the bubble, besides the fact that the Fed was hiking in 1999, was the fact that a lot of the build-out was financed by companies that were incurring debt and had no revenues on the other side,"" he stated.
He highlighted the fact that a similar trend is playing out as debt issuance accelerates and as tech companies maneuver to quickly scale operations and pull ahead of competitors. Emanuel said the fears are ""rational.""
Tech companies have been sprinting to tap the debt markets for financing lately, with hyperscalers like Amazon, Meta, and Oracle among the tech firms leading a global glut of bond issuance in 2025. 
The combination of massive borrowing and uncertain payback from the companies propping up the stock market may make some investors nervous, as Emanuel said. The possibility of AI growth slowing or revenue taking longer to materialize could make it harder for tech leaders to service the debts they have incurred.
Additionally, these companies are no longer benefiting from the previously low interest rates, which could also prove problematic if the AI market starts to lose momentum.
Emanuel has spent the last few years spotting bubbles in the market. In 2019, he described the bull market in government bonds as the ""greatest bubble ever,"" predicting it could lead to significant losses for investors.
Just a few months ago, as markets prepared for Q2 earnings season, Emanuel warned that investors were likely too optimistic, predicting a market correction of up to 15%.
Although he's cautious on the AI debt issue, the strategist still sees compelling opportunities for investors who can stomach a bit of risk.
""From a valuation perspective, as much angst as there is, in comparison in the late 1990s, these names are, I wouldn't say cheap. But they're certainly not expensive relative to their own history,"" he said.

No matter where you come out on the AI bubble debate, your next move will boil down to one thing: how long you're willing to wait.
If you're an AI bull that believes in the productivity gains that will be unlocked, you might be OK with waiting a long time for that to materialize. Or maybe it's the opposite. You want tangible results now, and that's impacting your investment decisions.
AI bears also face a time conundrum: Do they dump positions now and wait for any inevitable storm to pass? That can be risky. As investing legend Jeremy Grantham once told me, on a returns basis, it's just as damaging to sell too early than it is to hit eject too late.
So do these bears wait longer and try to time the market more precisely? That can be a stressful and high-risk situation as well.
This discussion gets to the heart of a new market driver that has burst onto the scene in recent weeks: investor impatience. That skittishness has contributed to increased concerns around AI stock valuations.
Suddenly, the companies pouring tens of billions into AI — and getting the benefit of the doubt for their efforts — are feeling the heat. The group, which felt unassailable mere weeks ago, is now facing questions from investors: When is this going to start paying off? And do I want to wait around that long?
Data from Goldman Sachs shows that this investor impatience has already manifested itself in the market.
The chart below shows three distinct buckets of AI stocks: Phase 2 (AI infrastructure), Phase 3 (AI revenue-enabled), and Phase 4 (AI productivity). The phases are in chronological order, meaning investors in AI-productivity stocks will be waiting the longest for results.
The takeaway is clear: investors in the AI trade are focused on the stocks with the clearest near-term AI-related earnings upside. Hence the outperformance of the Phase 2 AI infrastructure names (dark blue line). On the flip side, the further out the profit growth, the less interest there is right now (green line).
So the next time you get into a debate about the AI bubble, consider asking your opponent not just which side they're on, but what they plan to do about it. Not in a confrontational manner… but in a way that sheds light on how they're thinking about time.
Are they a bull planning to wait for the long haul? Are they a bear that wants to bail, but not too soon?
Their response will boil down to how patient they're willing to be. And it'll be a lot more telling than simply picking one side of a binary discussion.

Black Friday deals have been heating up, and it appears that Garmin is finally ready to join the party with some great offers of its own. Whether you're in the market for a premium Fenix 8 or a dirt-cheap Forerunner, I've gathered all of my favorite Garmin smartwatch deals from across the web into this guide.
I'm talking about early Black Friday deals like $100 off the Garmin Instinct 3 Solar, an absolute battery beast, or this surprising Amazon offer that carves a straight 25% off the top-rated Forerunner 965. 
Sure, discounts could get even better as we approach November 28th, but if you need to place an order today, I got you covered. Did nothing catch your eye? Check back later: I'll keep adding new Garmin deals as I find them.
Garmin Venu 3 45mm: $449.99 $349.99 at Best Buy
Garmin Forerunner 265 46mm: $449.99 $299.99 at Best Buy
Garmin Forerunner 55: $199.99 $149.99 at Amazon
Garmin fenix 8 47mm: $1,099.99 $849.99 at Best Buy
Garmin Forerunner 965: $599.99 $449.99 at Amazon

Black Friday is set for November 28th, which is the day after the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States. Although the official date is still a week away, I'm finding that retailers are launching their sales much earlier than recent years, so don't wait if you see a Low Stock warning on one of your desired items. 
Retailers like Amazon and Best Buy tend to have the best Garmin watch deals this time of year, but it never hurts to check Garmin.com to see what official discounts are available. If you don't mind using refurbished tech, you can also check sites like Backmarket.com for hefty discounts on renewed smartwatches. 
Although it's really going to depend on your individual needs, we generally consider the Venu 3 to be one of the best Garmin watches for most folks. This is namely due to the watch's approachable price tag, high-end fitness features, and battery life.

The surging value of firms such as NVIDIA has fuelled concerns about an AI stock market bubble.Credit: Kent Nishimura/Bloomberg via Getty
After years of hype and ballooning investment, the boom in artificial intelligence technology is beginning to show signs of strain. Many financial analysts now agree that there is an ‘AI bubble’, and some speculate it could finally burst in the next few months.
In economic terms, the rise of AI is unlike any other tech boom in history — there is now 17 times more investment in AI than in Internet companies before the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. And, valued at around US$4.6 trillion, the AI company NVIDIA was worth more than the economies of every nation except the United States, China and Germany.
But AI is not living up the promise of revolutionizing multiple sectors — nearly 80% of companies using AI found it had had no significant impact on their earnings, according to a report from management consulting firm McKinsey, and concerns over the basic architecture of chatbots is leading scientists to say that AI has the potential to harm their research. These doubts over the technology’s utility, and financial viability, is leading analysts and investors to speculate that a crash is coming. Even tech chief executives such as Sam Altman of ChatGPT’s parent company OpenAI in San Francisco, California, have admitted that parts of the field are “kind of bubbly right now”.
So, if a crash is imminent, how will it affect AI research and the scientists and engineers who make it happen?
Some analysts say that an AI-market collapse would be even more catastrophic than the dot-com crash — a shock that wiped out more than $5 trillion in stock-market value and led to hundreds of thousands of job losses in the tech industry alone. Like those of other tech bubbles before it, the dot-com crash had a lasting impact on computer-science research, says John Turner, an economist and historian at Queen’s University Belfast, UK. “But it wasn’t all bad,” he adds.
“In 2000, a lot of highly skilled electronic engineers and computer scientists lost their jobs” and demand for computer-science graduates plummeted, he says. This led to a drop in the numbers of computer-science graduates — but despite this, research output didn’t falter, and the average number of computer-science publications continued to rise each year during and after the dot-com crash (see Dot-com crash aftermath’). Similarly, the roll-out of telecommunication technologies such as mobile phones and the Internet continued unabated.
Sources: National Center for Education Statistics; Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2025. 
Brent Goldfarb, an economist at University of Maryland in College Park, says similar lay-offs in AI researchers and developers would happen were the AI bubble to burst. The biggest impact “would be on the hoard of start-ups jumping on the AI bandwagon, like the tenth AI notetaking app or AI scientist”, he says. OpenAI, Google, NVIDIA and other major AI companies “will likely survive”, he says. “The last thing they’ll do is get rid of their scientific core; that’s the path to the future.”
In fact, crashes can have a silver lining: they can take innovation into other sectors when leading scientists change jobs, Turner says. Take, for instance the British bicycle crash of 1896. “Motorcycles, motorcars, the Wright brothers; all can trace their origins to the bicycle bubble,” he says. “The railway ‘manias’ of the nineteenth century left the legacy of railways for the benefit of people, much like the dot-com bubble gave society the Internet.”
Currently, the tech industry eclipses academia when it comes to AI, in terms of both investment and publication output. Some researchers have called this an “AI brain drain”, which sidelines exploratory science in favour of commercial interest1. “If I’m an AI researcher working at OpenAI, why would I go to a university when I earn ten times the salary?” Goldfarb says.

Harry Potter introduced us to a whole bunch of cool (and scary) creatures, but few are as quietly haunting as the Thestrals. In fact, these bat-winged creatures are only visible to those who have witnessed or processed death. And now, thanks to LEGO, you can bring a pair home â that too for less.
The Thestral Family set usually retails for $70, but we just spotted it for 30% off on Amazon, which drops the price to just $49. It makes a great holiday gift for the Potterhead in your life, or even a fun treat for yourself if youâre looking to bring key elements of the Wizarding World home. Just note that Amazon has listed it as a limited-time markdown, which is why we highly recommend getting your orders in quickly. The sale is likely going to wrap up soon.
See at Amazon
This set is designed for ages 10 and up. You get a total of 548 pieces, which come together to build two posable Thestrals (one adult and one baby), plus a mini Forbidden Forest tree. With under 550 pieces, it wonât exactly be a large project you need to dedicate your entire weekend to, but also not too short.
The attention to detail is impressive on the creatures with striking skeletal forms and distinctive bat-like features. The adult Thestral stands over 9.5 inches tall, and even both come with fabric wings that fold out for flight poses. The head, legs, and wings are articulated, meaning kids can adjust them according to the scene they are trying to recreate. Maybe fold out the wings when itâs roaming through the Forbidden Forest casually, or keep them up when it senses a threat nearby!
Speaking of the Forbidden Forest, the small tree adds to the atmosphere, pulling the set together nicely. Like all LEGO sets, this one comes with a detailed instruction book that takes you through each step one by one. Itâs quite easy to follow, but if you also have the option to install the LEGO Builder app for 3D instructions. It lets you zoom in on each step, see it from all angles, track your progress, and more.
All things considered, this set can be a great holiday gift for a Harry Potter fan in your life, and you can even get it for yourself. Just be sure to grab it up before the sale expires.

Warren Buffett has backed a winner in Alphabet, and there's a bigger market risk than a crash in AI stocks, Tom Russo says.
The veteran investor and managing member of Gardner Russo & Quinn is well placed to weigh in. His firm's top two holdings at the end of September were a $1.1 billion stake in Alphabet and a $1.8 billion stake in Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, together accounting for 31% of its $9.3 billion US stock portfolio, regulatory filings show.
Berkshire purchased 17.8 million shares in Google's parent company, worth $4.3 billion as of September 30, its third-quarter portfolio update revealed last week. The stake surprised many of Buffett's close followers, as the famed bargain hunter has eschewed technology stocks for most of his career.
Buffett — or one of his two investment managers, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs — may have bet on Alphabet before it surged, Russo told Business Insider.
Its stock price rose nearly 40% in the three months ending September 30, from under $180 to $244, and has climbed another 17% since then to clear $285. If Berkshire bought in early last quarter, it may have only paid $3.1 billion or so for a position worth $5.1 billion as of Monday's close.
Even after its recent jump, Alphabet continues to trade at a ""below-market"" price-to-earnings ratio, Russo said, hailing the company as a ""remarkably solid and strong business.""
Russo outlined what may have spurred Berkshire to bet on the search-and-advertising titan behind YouTube, Waymo, DeepMind, and Android.
He said that Alphabet has long shown a ""capacity to suffer"" — a willingness to make long-term investments that constrain short-term profits, and not cave into Wall Street's demand for smooth earnings growth each quarter.
Russo and his team ""look right through"" Alphabet's heavy spending on research and development to determine its potential profitability, he said. They also ""applaud"" its open commitment to funding so-called moonshots, or speculative tech bets with the potential to pay off enormously, he added.
Alphabet also has a ""mountain of cash"" like Berkshire thanks to the powerful cash generation of its operations, and its position as one of the biggest players in AI could yield huge financial rewards, he said.
However, Russo said there's a risk that Alphabet's large investments in AI don't generate the scalable, superior returns that can ""drive the payback"" like its past initiatives have. The company has projected its capital expenditures in 2025 will exceed $90 billion.
There's also a danger that the era of ""extraordinary margins"" for Alphabet's search business is over, despite the company enhancing it with its Gemini AI, he added.
Russo said that Alphabet is ""mischaracterized"" as simply a tech company, when it plays a critical role in helping businesses become more precise, effective, and efficient in reaching their target customers.
""You get that right and people beat a path to your door,"" he said.
Alphabet is also ""deeply embedded in the commerce of the world,"" which could help it to fend off the next generation of rivals even if they have technological advantages, he said.
Away from Alphabet, Russo said the fallout from the mushrooming US debt could be ""potentially more disruptive"" than a collapse in AI stocks.
America's national debt has nearly doubled within the past decade, soaring from below $20 trillion in 2016 to over $38 trillion today, Treasury data shows.
The ""pressure"" to service that debt, and growing threats to the US dollar's status as the world's reserve currency, are paving the way for a weaker, less influential greenback, Russo said.
He said the ""more unexamined"" area where ""financial disruption"" could occur might be in the bond and currency markets, and the wider macroeconomic and political spheres.
""Those who hold our claims have interests that go far beyond just lending to the US, but really supplanting it,"" he said.
America's leading position in the world has powered increases in its citizens' living standards and supported global stability for decades, he said. Retreating from the world stage could stymie further gains and prove destabilizing, he cautioned.
""Never should somebody give their consumer the opportunity, the incentive to look elsewhere for satisfaction,"" Russo said, paraphrasing Buffett's late business partner, Charlie Munger.

Serious athletes need watches that can survive extreme conditions and track every metric that matters for performance optimization. Budget fitness trackers cannot keep up with ultramarathons, technical climbs or dive expeditions. The Garmin Fenix 8 is the brand’s first push beyond the $1,000 threshold in their flagship multisport line, and packs features that justify its position as the ultimate tool for dedicated athletes.
The good news is that Amazon has just dropped the 51mm Solar Sapphire model to $849 for Black Friday, down from its regular $1,199 price. That makes it an all-time low that brings the grail of sports watches within the grasp of those committed athletes who previously shy away from four-figure pricing.
See at Amazon
The scratch-resistant sapphire lens on this 1.4-inch display holds up to impacts from rock scrambles, trail running branches, and the many accidental door frame collisions that destroy cheaper watches. Solar charging extends battery life to 48 days in smartwatch mode if you spend three hours daily in 50,000 lux sunlight-representative for outdoor athletes training regularly. GPS mode is functional for 149 continuous hours with solar assistance, accommodating multi-day ultra races or extended backcountry expeditions with no external chargers needed. The always-on display is readable in direct sunlight and automatically adjusts brightness based on ambient light to save battery while keeping it visible during activities.
Carbon gray DLC titanium construction balances strength with wearability, keeping weight manageable for all-day comfort while maintaining structural integrity during hard use. DLC coating resists scratches better than standard titanium finishes and preserves the watch’s appearance through years of abuse. The 51mm case size accommodates larger wrists comfortably and houses the sensors and battery capacity that smaller models sacrifice for compactness.
Multi-band GPS with SatIQ technology simultaneously accesses signals from multiple satellite constellations and calculates your position with a degree of precision unreachable for single-band receivers under the most difficult conditions. The system will automatically switch between single and multi-band modes depending on environment difficulty, saving battery during open-sky running while engaging full accuracy under tree cover or canyon walls. Various inbuilt sensors like a three-axis compass, gyroscope, and barometric altimeter independently generate navigation data from GPS which becomes vital when satellite signals are blocked or you need to economize on battery life over longer trips.
Training readiness scoring analyzes sleep quality, recovery metrics, training load, and heart rate variability to calculate whether you should push hard or scale back intensity. The watch tracks HRV overnight through wrist-based sensors that detect autonomic nervous system balance, which indicates recovery status. Real-time stamina tracking during activities shows how much energy remains before exhaustion so you can pace your efforts appropriately during long races or intense training blocks.
The 40-meter dive rating with leakproof metal buttons allows for scuba and apnea diving activities, monitoring depth, time, and decompression requirements during underwater exploration. Metal buttons maintain seal integrity far better than capacitive surfaces that leak under pressure, ensuring the operation of the watch under the most adverse conditions.
The built-in speaker and microphone enable phone calls directly from your wrist when it is paired with your smartphone. This makes calls possible during runs or rides, with no need to stop and dig through pockets. Voice assistant integration lets you respond to messages hands-free and stay focused on the activity. Also, ECG monitoring records heart rhythm while screening for signs of atrial fibrillation and enables health insights beyond standard fitness tracking.
You’re paying what used Fenix models sell for on secondary markets at $849 for titanium construction, sapphire crystal protection, solar charging, and dive-rated durability with professional-grade training analytics. This $350 discount transforms Garmin’s flagship from an aspirational purchase to an achievable upgrade for serious athletes.

16,2025-11-19,"Thermoses have gotten kind of amazing these days. Have you noticed? The best double-walled, vacuum-insulated travel mugs can keep your coffee hot literally all day. I've left my Fellow Carter Move mug (see on Amazon) in a car for hours while hitting the farmers market and meeting a friend for lunch, only to discover my coffee still bracingly hot and tasting pretty much the same as when I brewed it. It feels like a miracle.
So when a new company called Host Modern offered to do the same thing for candied yams or brussels sprouts, with a handsome new double-wall, vacuum-insulated serving dish, I was primed to fall in love—inasmuch as one can fall in love with a serving dish.
If the dish works well at keeping food hot for extended periods, potlucks and picnics are the most obvious application. But even just serving hotter food at home is, in its own little way, life-changing.
Host Modern
Host Modern
I have cooked multiple seven-dish feasts for my family this past month, while testing Thanksgiving delivery meal kits, and timing is always the toughest part of a multi-part meal. It feels sad to nuke your brussels sprouts before dinner because the turkey ran long and the greens got cold. It only takes 20 minutes of reprieve to save Christmas!
Interestingly, Host Modern's public relations touts their serving dish as a “Yeti for food.” But of course, Yeti—a stalwart in the hot-things-hot, cool-things-cool game—likewise makes a Rambler vacuum-insulated bowl that is also, self-evidently, a Yeti for food. Which professed Yeti for food is the most Yeti for food? Yeti or Host Modern? I filled the bowls for a face-off.
Yeti
Amazon (4-quart serving bowl)
Amazon (Nesting 3-Bowl Set)
Yeti (Nesting 3-Bowl Set)
First off, it's worth asking if anyone needs a thermal serving dish. Is Thanksgiving saved, bettered, its pleasures embiggened? Or is it all just cold comfort? I assessed each brand's ability to keep liquid and solid food hot longer, versus a basic lidded Pyrex 4-Quart Mixing Bowl ($32) that costs a fraction of either the Yeti or the Host Modern.
I also used each bowl at a family feast, as a road test—and logged comments made by family members. Likeability also matters in something you hope to keep in your life. Call this the mom-and-sister test.
I'll spare you some suspense here. Serving dishes with big mouths don't and can't work as well as a travel mug at keeping things hot or cold. Most of the heat loss in a vacuum-insulated thermos is out of the lid. The lid on a big serving dish is, well, big. You can feel the heat leaking. But both the Yeti and the Host Modern still performed better than non-insulated serving dishes at keeping your food warmer, longer. Here are the results.
The largest Yeti Rambler bowl and Host Modern serving dishes are, in some regar,d radically different beasts—but have about the same advertised serving capacity.
The Host Modern is a large casserole-style serving dish, with a large surface area and the ability to fit a 9 x 13 aluminum baking dish inside it. Host also sells its own $40 baking dish that is back-ordered at the time of this article, but which I had the chance to test.
The idea is that you can bake your food, then drop the baking dish inside the serving dish for longer storage at food-safe or dining-friendly temperatures. Even better, you can drop boiling water into the main serving dish, then drop a casserole dish into the water as a heat bath to keep better temperature stability. Much like the Ford Model T, you can have it any color you like (so long as it's white).
The Yeti Rambler bowls are, as advertised, bowls. They won't fit a casserole dish inside, but for this the three-bowl set of 4.5-quart, 2-quart, and 1-quart bowls can nest conveniently inside each other. The set has mostly been advertised as campware, as befits Yeti's outdoor-friendly image, though Yeti's reps say that use as a home serving dish has turned into one of the biggest selling points for the Rambler bowls. This is also what I would use them for. Honestly, they look nice. Yeti stuff looks nice.
OK, so you're probably not planning to keep soup in a casserole dish. But the most objective test of heat retention is boiling water. Water has a stable heat capacity, and a precise boiling temperature. The same amount of water, from the same faucet, at the same elevation, will contain about the same amount of heat energy.
And so I heated a liter of water (technically 0.9 liters of water, the capacity of my Fellow Stagg EKG kettle), and poured it into each of the Host Modern, the 4.5-quart Yeti Rambler, and the 4-quart Pyrex. I left the lid on each, then checked on each at 20 minutes and an hour. For the Host Modern, I used a hot water bath underneath the casserole dish for best possible results. For the other two, I preheated by filling with hot water.
The amount of immediate heat loss to the air, and to the dish, stayed surprisingly consistent among serving dishes: the water leveled out quickly to 165 degrees Fahrenheit in each case, as measured by an infrared thermometer.
On holding times, the two insulated-wall serving dishes both outperformed the Pyrex, but not by as much as you'd hope. The Yeti came out ever so slightly on top, dropping more slowly over the course of an hour. But both the Yeti and Host Modern still dropped 40 degrees Fahrenheit after an hour. The uninsulated Pyrex, meanwhile, dropped a whopping 60 degrees.
Alas, at least in our test, heat loss to the container (even when pre-treated with hot water) meant that none of these maintained food-safe temps above 140 degrees for very long. Use an actual thermos if you're transporting bone broth long distances and then expect to drink it.
Note also that Host Modern conducted its own study, filling the serving dish 80-percent full with boiling water under presumably ideal conditions. According to the company, the Host Modern dish kept boiling water above 140 degrees for 2 hours when filled with a larger quantity of water.
Alongside the pumpkin, the sweet potato stands as America's most stalwart holiday side. And so it became my litmus test for the thermal dishes' ability to retain heat on food. I tested the Host and the Yeti side by side and found that at least with a 14-ounce serving of candied yams, the temp dropped pretty precipitously.
Larger servings might retain heat better—because the food itself has more thermal mass. But what I found was that the serving dishes offered were about a 20 to 30 minute holding time at eating temperatures, unless your food starts very, very hot. Not bad—and better than uninsulated dishes. But I wouldn't cart this to a potluck and expect your food to hold up. The heat loss from the lid is just too great.
But do note that when using a water bath around a baking dish, the Host actually outperformed the Yeti this time. Neither did overly well after an hour, with a candied yam dish whose temperature started at a serving temperature between 150 and 160 degrees Fahrenheit. In both cases, the dishes maintained at safe serving temperatures above 140 degrees for 20 minutes. Both dropped a lot more over the next 40 minutes, to temperatures below appropriate serving temperatures (and well below food-safe if left out longer than an hour.)
Again, these results don't quite gibe with Host Modern's own testing, which involved stuffed peppers heated to 198 degrees Fahrenheit. These, according to Host, stayed food-safe at 152 degrees after 90 minutes. My food dropped temp much faster than this—though again, higher volumes of food will hold temperature longer.
This is an admittedly anecdotal sampling. But: With both the Host Modern serving dish and the large Yeti insulated bowl laid out on the kitchen island, both my sister and mother—who arrived at different times—immediately and without prompting beaded in on the Yeti with a mix of praise and envy. Both had nearly the same words: “Oh, that's a cool dish!""
Yes, serving dishes are apparently “cool” in my family. Rebellious youth is behind us.
In Host Modern's defense, Yeti is a known brand—and the dish was blue, therefore perhaps more striking. The Yeti's thermal-insulated qualities are perhaps a bit better advertised by its stainless-steel top. But in the immediate impression test, the Yeti did win.
This said, once I dropped the baking casserole dish inside the Host, all eyes were on Host as a useful dish. So Yeti gets the edge, here, on impressing houseguests from one family in particular—but the Host is a bit of a sleeper once its charms are made apparent.
I like both of these serving dishes. I like the Host Modern as a casserole serving dish. I like the Yeti as a serving bowl. I like that I can put hot things inside them, and that the outside stays insulated. I like that they keep food warm for an extra 20 minutes or so.
Yeti probably has the edge, for the simple fact that I can get a 3-bowl Yeti set ($150) for the price of the Host Modern with a baking dish (when it comes back in stock). But also because I can feel, literally, on the outside of the bowl, that the Yeti has better double-walled insulation. The Rambler stays beautifully cool to the touch. If I can cover the lid with more material, I'd trust it more for longer-term holding.
But I will admit my hopes are a bit dashed on both counts. I had hoped for a thermal-insulated dish I'd feel comfortable taking to a potluck—containing a big roast, or a platter of mac and cheese—with the expectation the dish would stay above the safe holding temperature of 140 degrees Fahrenheit for extended periods. This isn't reliably true for either.
Physics are physics: Serving dishes with large-surface-area lids cannot hold temp the same way as an insulated cylinder with a small lid. Yeti, admirably, is very straightforward about this in its website copy, noting (with questionable grammar) that “bowls with wide opening means content may cool quicker than Rambler drinkware.” And if the FDA is to be believed, you don't really want to eat food that's been kept between 90 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit for longer than an hour.
But though my hopes for potluck utility weren't borne out, each of these insulated dishes is still terrific for large multi-course meals. An extra 20 or 30 minutes at appropriate serving temperatures can be the difference between a well-timed meal, and one where the mac and cheese had to go into the microwave—especially on meals where the oven is in heavy use and can't be used as a warming drawer.
Presumably, for some families, wrangling the brood together to actually sit at the table on a Thursday can also be a 20-minute process. And so each of these dishes still serve a useful function. The Host Modern is especially well-suited for big feasts, given that the casserole dish can just slip into the insulated sheath, then land handsomely on the table without need of a hot pad.
Which is to say the Host Modern thermal serving dish is best for when I am, in fact, the host. For this, it's quite nice.

17,2025-11-19,"The increasing dominance of lithium cells in the market place leave our trusty NiMH cells in a rough spot. Sure, you can still get a chargers for the AAs in your life, but it’s old tech and not particularly stylish. That’s where [Maximilian Kern] comes in, whose SPINC project was recently featured in IEEE Spectrum— so you know it has to be good.
With the high-resolution LCD, the styling of this device reminds us a little bit of the Pi-Mac-Nano— and anything that makes you think of a classic Macintosh gets automatic style points. There’s something reminiscent of an ammunition clip in the way batteries are fed into the top and let out the bottom of the machine.
[Maximilian] thought of the, ah, less-detail-oriented amongst us with this one, as the dedicated charging IC he chose (why reinvent the wheel?) is connected to an H-bridge to allow the charger to be agnostic as to orientation. That’s a nice touch. An internal servo grabs each battery in turn to stick into the charging circuit, and deposits it into the bottom of the device once it is charged. The LCD screen lets you monitor the status of the battery as it charges, while doubling as a handy desk clock (that’s where the RP2040 comes in). It is, of course powered by a USB-C port as all things are these days, but [Maximilian] is just drawing from the 5V line instead of making proper use of USB-C Power Delivery. (An earlier draft of this article asserted incorrectly that the device used USB-C-PD.)  Fast-charging upto 1A is enabled, but you might want to go slower to keep your cells lasting as long as possible. Firmware, gerbers and STLs are available on GitHub under a GPL-3.0 license– so if you’re still using NiCads or want to bring this design into the glorious lithium future, you can consider yourself welcome to.
We recently featured a AA rundown, and for now, it looks like NiMH is still the best bang for your buck, which means this project will remain relevant for a few years yet. Of course, we didn’t expect the IEEE to steer us wrong.
Thanks to [George Graves] for the tip.
Nice feature in IEEE Spectrum! Its good to see a project get cleaned up and get a proper writeup. The Spectrum article has way better illustrations and writing than the last time this was making the rounds. https://hackaday.com/2024/12/02/the-automatic-battery-charger-you-never-knew-you-needed/
What is a high-resolution LED ? Is it superior to a thorough proof-reading process ?
Maybe it’s a Light Emitting Display? ;-)
That is technically correct– the best kind of correct! This Light Emitting Display is an LCD, though, and the article has been updated to reflect that.
should probably have read “LED panel” — it’s the display, a matrix of individual diodes
The sister technology to the LCD, LED is the Liquid Emitting Display ;-)
The display on my old DELL laptop failed that way, by emitting a sticky viscous liquid. SVLED
One year on, let’s see how this project is doing:
https://hackaday.com/2024/12/02/the-automatic-battery-charger-you-never-knew-you-needed/
Thanks for digging that out.
I knew I saw this on HAD before.
Correction: this doesn’t use USB Power Delivery, just a USB Type-C port. The CC lines are just pulled to ground with 5.1 kΩ resistors.
Which is, er, not great? 1.2 W is more than some old-fashioned USB ports can provide, as a unit load is only 100 mA at 5 V, but I see nothing to indicate that it checks if it can take at least 3 unit loads. A non-enumerating option would be to hook up an ADC to the CC lines to do Type-C Current detection, but the PCB has no such connection.
Props for solving the problem of charging multiple AA cells in a much sillier and more complex way than just using a multi-cell charger, but falls into the typical camp of being cavalier about USB power limitations.
Huh. I admit when his writeup said “USB-C powered” I assumed that meant PD given the current draw. Checking the schematic shows you are absolutely correct. How disappointing.
That’s an interesting topic. I think as long as you connect this to any USB-C device, everything should be good, as USB-C specifies a minimum of 500mA. This would only be an issue with a USB-C to USB-A adapter cable. Any even then, ports with less than 100mA of current capability are rare. Now I have to check if the rp2040 could do the enumeration…
Is this what we are down to, reused content from old HaD articles?
Not deliberately– [George] submitted his tip in good faith, and I evidently missed the previous feature in our archives. Mea culpa.
Well, I’m glad you did as I missed it first time around. Now I want one. :D
No mention of the Olight Ostation X?
https://www.olight.com/ostation-x-super-charger
https://www.olight.com/store/ostation-x-3-in-1-rechargeable-aa-aaa-battery-charger
The flaw I see with these hopper style chargers is that the charged batteries end up sitting off charger.
Maybe I need new batteries, but I always find my spare batteries are dead unless I’ve left them on the charger.  Presently I have 16 battery chargers and just leave my NiMH batteries to cook on them.
I know that NiMH batteries aren’t quite that old, but at first blush, I thought the timepiece in this build was a flip-clock.   IMO, it would really round out the retro aesthetic.

YouTube TV subscribers just wrapped up a two-week standoff with Disney that ended with what looked like a massive win: free access to ESPN Unlimited by the end of 2026. But baseball fans celebrating the deal could end up disappointed.
Puck's John Ourand reports that MLB.TV, a key sports add-on for cord-cutters, will not be included in the new bundle. It appears that while YouTube TV and Disney were ironing out their deal, Major League Baseball made a separate plan to move MLB.TV into the ESPN app starting in 2026.
That move lets MLB consolidate its out-of-market games under ESPN’s direct-to-consumer umbrella, rather than relying on third-party distributors like YouTube TV. So, even though YouTube TV now carries more ESPN content, it doesn’t gain access to MLB.TV.
This is a real setback for people who use YouTube TV to watch out-of-market baseball. MLB.TV has been an important part of sports streaming, and many subscribers thought that adding more ESPN channels to YouTube TV would also bring MLB’s package.
Instead, YouTube TV gets the broader ESPN catalog, but the one piece baseball fans wanted most is now being tucked away behind ESPN’s own app. The technical reason is pretty simple: MLB’s new rights structure gives ESPN the keys to out-of-market streaming, letting the league manage distribution, pricing, and bundling more directly.
The bigger picture is that sports streaming is getting even more fragmented. A single subscription rarely covers everything anymore, and even highly publicized carriage deals come with fine print that can reshape what you actually get.
The next step is watching how MLB prices the new setup inside the ESPN app and whether it stays a standalone add-on or becomes part of a larger bundle.
Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android
Meanwhile, it remains to be seen whether YouTube TV pursues a separate agreement for MLB.TV or leave the baseball die-hards to subscribe elsewhere. Either way, subscribers looking for complete MLB coverage will soon need more than just YouTube TV, no matter how many ESPN channels the service adds.

A scenario that investors have been worried about all year might be unfolding. 
David Roche, a strategist at Quantum Strategy and the former head of research at Morgan Stanley, said he believes two bubbles in the market may already be starting to burst, despite talk of the rally in risk assets having further to run.
He sees two spots in the market where the air is coming out of the bubble:
Roche speculated that the bursting of the bubbles could result in economic damage similar to what was seen after the Great Financial Crisis. That's largely due to the fallout in the US credit market, which is the ""key"" to whether a bubble truly hurts the economy, he said.
""So this is the beginning of something which could have serious economic consequences,"" the longtime strategist told CNBC this week.
Roche, who described his own portfolio as geared toward wealth protection, shared a few investment tips to help investors navigate precarious macroeconomic conditions. Here are the top investment plays he recommends: 
These assets are ""core to any portfolio,"" Roche said, referring to how gold in particular is seen as a safe haven and hedge against issues like inflation.
Gold is having a fantastic year amid an aggressive appetite from central banks and investors who are worried about tariffs, inflation, and high levels of debt and deficit spending worldwide. The price of bullion traded around $4,110 on Wednesday, up 53.9% year-to-date.
Roche said he likes real assets, as these are also typically seen as defensive plays.
The VanEck Real Assets ETF is up 20.1% from levels at the start of the year. The provider's Rare Earth and Strategic Metals ETF is also up 81.9% year-to-date.
Roche said his view of equities is ""very negative,"" apart from nuclear and traditional defense shares. He pointed to emerging geopolitical conflict around the world as one reason why investors might turn to that area of the market for safety.
The VanEck Uranium and Nuclear ETF is up 49.6% year-to-date and the Global X Defense Tech ETF is up 72% this year. 
Roche said he was also ""negative generally"" on bonds. That's due to higher debt levels and deficit spending among governments around the world, he said, which makes holding bonds less attractive.

Michelle Carnahan spent four years as the president of VC-backed healthcare startup Thirty Madison, and before that, had a two-decade-long career at pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly. Now, she's launching her own startup without a drop of VC funding.
Arbiter, Carnahan's latest venture, has raised $52 million in seed funding at a $400 million valuation, Business Insider has learned exclusively.
Instead of turning to VCs, Carnahan raised the round from multiple family offices, which are essentially private investment firms that manage all aspects of a wealthy family's finances. TriEdge Investments and MFO Ventures co-led the round, joined by private equity firm WindRose Health Investors.
Arbiter's platform connects patient data to automate administrative tasks on behalf of healthcare providers and health plans, including referrals and appointment scheduling. The healthcare AI startup is only 6 months old, but its tech is already live with over 1,000 clinicians, which Carnahan credits to Arbiter's family office backing.
Carnahan has spent most of her career at Big Pharma, including a 26-year stint at Eli Lilly. She was at Thirty Madison during the 2021 VC funding boom, when the startup notched a $1 billion valuation. This September, Thirty Madison was acquired in an all-stock deal for over $500 million.
Carnahan said she didn't set out to avoid VC money, despite having witnessed the boom-and-bust cycle firsthand.
Instead, she said she turned to family offices because Arbiter was looking for more than just capital — the company wanted specialized healthcare investors who could bring their tech to market fast.
""This gives us not only a knowledge advantage, but a distribution advantage in partnerships that would take years to develop,"" Carnahan said.
Carnahan met Dr. Eric Moskow, cofounder and chairman of MFO Ventures, in 2022 while she was at Thirty Madison. They bonded over their frustrations with how fragmented the healthcare system had become, with data siloes and countless single-solution software products.
With the early promise of Moskow's backing, Arbiter acquired a data platform from SecondWave Delivery Systems, a healthcare company Moskow founded in 2020, along with the platform's customers and some employees. The software pulls patient data from different medical records into one place and evaluates patient health risks and other clinical factors to help doctors make better treatment decisions.
Carnahan said the deal accelerated Arbiter's path to market by 18 months. Arbiter didn't disclose exactly how much it paid for the tech, but said the deal represented a small portion of its seed funding. The company said it also signed an agreement with SecondWave to allow SecondWave to continue selling to its broader customer base, which gives Arbiter contracted multi-year revenue.
On top of SecondWave's data layer and risk adjustment capabilities, Arbiter is building AI infrastructure in-house to automate more actions across payers and providers.
Its first application uses AI agents to proactively reach out to patients, schedule appointments, and follow up with them after visits. That patient engagement tech is live with several health plans, Carnahan said.
Arbiter plans combine all of its capabilities into a unified ""operating spine"" for healthcare, which Carnahan said will launch next year with a major national payer and provider network, focused on automating referrals. She declined to share the names of those partners.
""Everyone keeps building new instruments for the orchestra. There's a prior auth tool here, an analytics dashboard there, but no one's building the conductor. Arbiter is that conductor,"" Carnahan said.
Arbiter is considering additional acquisitions to further boost its growth.
The startup is looking for solutions with a clear data strategy — Arbiter can make the tools more AI-forward, but it wants a solid data foundation for the AI first, Carnahan said. She's also considering technology that can take actions leading up to a doctor's visit, such as prior authorizations or supporting care in non-hospital settings, like the home.
Ultimately, Arbiter wants to move healthcare from reactive to proactive, including by using predictive AI modeling to forecast events such as disease onset and hospital stays.
Because Arbiter has big ambitions, it faces a full field of competitors, from AI-powered patient engagement startups like Hippocratic AI to companies that focus on freeing up healthcare capacity like DexCare.
Arbiter has assembled a top team of board members and clinical advisors to take on that challenge, including Dr. Clive Fields, an Arbiter board member and the cofounder of VillageMD, and Dr. Ainsley MacLean, a clinical advisor and the former chief medical information officer at health system giant Kaiser Permanente's mid-Atlantic Permanente Medical Group.
After 13 years in leadership roles at Kaiser Permanente, MacLean started her own private equity firm this year to back healthcare AI companies — and she thinks Arbiter's tech can lay the groundwork for the innovations she wants to invest in.
""I see Arbiter as the Palantir of healthcare,"" MacLean told Business Insider. ""It's that kind of play, but with the deep connections, trust, and understanding of healthcare that will make them successful.""

From the Fed: Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, October 28-29, 2025.  Excerpt:In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants noted that inflation had moved up since earlier in the year and remained somewhat elevated. Participants further noted that available indicators suggested that economic activity had been expanding at a moderate pace. They observed that job gains had slowed this year and that the unemployment rate had edged up but remained low through August. Participants assessed that more recent indicators were consistent with these developments. In addition, they judged that downside risks to employment had risen in recent months. Against this backdrop, many participants were in favor of lowering the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting, some supported such a decision but could have also supported maintaining the level of the target range, and several were against lowering the target range. Those who favored or could have supported a lowering of the target range for the federal funds rate toward a more neutral setting generally observed that such a decision was appropriate because downside risks to employment had increased in recent months and upside risks to inflation had diminished since earlier this year or were little changed. Those who preferred to keep the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting expressed concern that progress toward the Committee's inflation objective had stalled this year, as inflation readings increased, or that more confidence was needed that inflation was on a course toward the Committee's 2 percent objective, while also noting that longer-term inflation expectations could rise should inflation not return to 2 percent in a timely manner. One participant agreed with the need to move toward a more neutral monetary policy stance but preferred a 1/2 percentage point reduction at this meeting. In light of their assessment that reserve balances had reached or were approaching ample levels, almost all participants noted that it was appropriate to conclude the reduction in the Committee's aggregate securities holdings on December 1 or that they could support such a decision.

In considering the outlook for monetary policy, participants expressed a range of views about the degree to which the current stance of monetary policy was restrictive. Some participants assessed that the Committee's policy stance would be restrictive even after a potential 1/4 percentage point reduction in the policy rate at this meeting. By contrast, some participants pointed to the resilience of economic activity, supportive financial conditions, or estimates of short-term real interest rates as indicating that the stance of monetary policy was not clearly restrictive. In discussing the near-term course of monetary policy, participants expressed strongly differing views about what policy decision would most likely be appropriate at the Committee's December meeting. Most participants judged that further downward adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate as the Committee moved to a more neutral policy stance over time, although several of these participants indicated that they did not necessarily view another 25 basis point reduction as likely to be appropriate at the December meeting. Several participants assessed that a further lowering of the target range for the federal funds rate could well be appropriate in December if the economy evolved about as they expected over the coming intermeeting period. Many participants suggested that, under their economic outlooks, it would likely be appropriate to keep the target range unchanged for the rest of the year. All participants agreed that monetary policy was not on a preset course and would be informed by a wide range of incoming data, the evolving economic outlook, and the balance of risks.

In discussing risk-management considerations that could bear on the outlook for monetary policy, participants generally judged that upside risks to inflation remained elevated and that downside risks to employment were elevated and had increased since the first half of the year. Many participants agreed that the Committee should be deliberate in its policy decisions against the backdrop of these two-sided risks and reduced availability of key economic data. br />

Android operating systems in 2025 are what individual phone brands make of them. Android 16 is publicly available as part of the Android Open Source Project, but it’s barebones, and brands like Google and Samsung put their own twists and styling atop it — that’s how we end up with Pixel UI, One UI, OxygenOS, and other variants. The two biggest flavors, Google’s Material 3 Expressive and One UI 8, couldn’t be more different.
Samsung overhauled its operating system with One UI 7, opting for a subtle and iOS-like appearance that extends into One UI 8. Meanwhile, Google doubled down on Material You, releasing Material 3 Expressive as part of Android 16 for Pixel phones, tablets, and watches. One is minimalist, the other maximalist. One has a muted color palette while the other’s is bold and vibrant.
But which one is best? I compared these polarizing design languages to find the most appealing one on a daily basis. This is purely a design and user-interface comparison, so I’m focusing on the appearance and ease of use of these Android skins.
Despite the visual differences, Material 3 Expressive and One UI 8 have quite a bit in common. They both go all-in on AI summaries in the form of Now Brief on Galaxy phones and At a Glance on Pixels (RIP Daily Hub). Samsung’s Now Brief works in tandem with the Now Bar, a pill-shaped data field that can appear on the One UI 8 status bar or lock screen. The Now Bar and Brief try to learn your habits and adjust dynamically based on the situation.
It all sounds like At a Glance, a pinnacle Pixel feature that is a fixture of the Material 3 Expressive home screen. Google’s daily helper blends in better with the Pixel home screen and can successfully surface more information than the Now Bar and Brief. Samsung’s offering is a glorified widget, while At a Glance feels like it was built to be the centerpiece of Pixel UI. I’ve only ever had the Now Brief tell me the weather and to “enjoy the rest of my day,” but At a Glance can be genuinely useful at times, finding calendar events and reminders to display.
At a Glance crushes Now Brief in utility, but bringing in Samsung’s Now Bar makes this a different ballgame. The latter is a true alternative to Apple’s Dynamic Island on iOS. It can show live sports scores, now playing media, timers, and other urgent updates. Controls are only a tap away — they would’ve been stashed in the notification shade previously. The Now Bar and Brief are even more colorful, helping One UI 8 beat Material 3 Expressive at its own game.
Material 3 Expressive brought system-wide visual and typography changes, like 15 new “emphasized” styles with higher font weights. It also coincided with major Google app redesigns for defaults, including Weather, Clock, and Calendar. One UI 8, for the most part, defaults to first-party Samsung apps. While some Samsung apps have their own character, Material 3 Expressive’s stock apps appear more thoughtful and cohesive.
Case in point, the Samsung Weather app’s potential seems squandered by unnecessary visual elements. The actual temperature and weather conditions seem to come second compared to the cartoon of a person looking at their phone. Aside from that strange animation, the One UI 8 Weather app is more information-dense than the Material 3 Expressive version.
The Pixel Weather app might be the best example of Material 3 Expressive design characteristics in action. The top of each Weather card is fairly basic, with pills for AI weather reports and forecasts. Things get interesting when you scroll down to the Pixel Weather app’s tiles. They seemingly use every Material 3 Expressive design element, from a large navigation arrow showing wind direction, to colorful gauges for pressure and pollen levels, to squiggles and dots for UV index and visibility.
Google’s Material 3 Expressive apps come off as inviting, whereas the bland look of One UI 8 defaults might make using them feel like a chore.
For example, Samsung’s Calendar and Clock apps are mostly black and white, with only a few accent colors. Google’s equivalents are filled with color. When you turn on an alarm in the Clock app, all the text becomes bolded as the background fills with color shading. Flipping the same toggle on One UI 8 merely colors the text with your pre-set color theme. It’s so subtle that you may miss it, while Material 3 Expressive is loud and unmistakable.
Regardless of whether you love or hate Material 3 Expressive design, it’s clear that Google nailed theming and customization. iOS 26’s Liquid Glass did one thing right — it forced all apps to conform to its design language. Google is doing the exact same with Material 3 Expressive, which applies your chosen theme and color palette across the system. There are even new theme packs that set a custom wallpaper, color palette, and app icons for you.
These elements permeate throughout Android 16 on Pixel phones, and they’re more noticeable due to Material 3 Expressive’s abundance of color. While One UI 8 has similar functionality, it doesn’t do enough. There are color palettes, but choices are limited, and they don’t extend to all app icons.
Galaxy Themes are another issue. In a way, they’re better than Pixel theme packs — there are far more Galaxy Themes available, and make no mistake, Google’s implementation is little more than a brand deal at the moment. On the other hand, the entire Galaxy Themes page in Settings feels like bloatware to me. It’s filled with overpriced “themes” that mostly change just the wallpaper and device sounds. Meanwhile, Pixel theme packs at least feel intentional, and make their way beyond wallpapers and system sounds to places like icons and GIFs. They’re also completely free, unlike the vast majority of Galaxy Themes.
Google’s Themed icons toggle in Android 16’s latest betas is a game-changer for Material 3 Expressive that finally lets users force all apps to comply with system color theming. Until Samsung adds a similar feature to One UI 8, it can’t compete in theming and customization. The default options simply aren’t enough, and users shouldn’t have to download separate add-ons like Good Lock and Home Up to get more. They’re clunky, and the average user won’t bother with them — if they’re aware of them at all.
The split notification shade is controversial among Android fans. Samsung and Google drew lines in the sand, with the former going for the split shade by default and the latter sticking with the unified shade. Both sport pill-shaped notification bubbles and control toggles, and have a background blur that lets your open apps remain slightly visible. It’s clearer in One UI 8, while Material 3 Expressive’s blur is more aggressive, improving visibility.
Samsung gives One UI 8 users light haptic feedback when they clear a notification or tap a button. Material 3 Expressive’s behavior is more noticeable, giving users the feeling of notification cards snapping out of place when cleared, and there’s a visual animation to match. Quick Settings are revamped to allow for custom sizing, with unique elements like a squiggly progress bar for now-playing media.
One UI 8 does manage to squeeze more toggles into the control panel, and that isn’t surprising — the entire Android 16 skin seems to prioritize function over form.
Samsung didn’t take major risks with One UI 8. The operating system leans into the status quo, applying a minimalist design language that often prioritizes transparency over color. Material 3 Expressive does the opposite, putting color and loud design at the forefront of Pixel UI. Neither approach is perfect. One UI 8’s Now Bar and notification shade are basic but useful in the best way. On the other hand, Material 3 Expressive’s theming, consistency, and customization are unmatched.
Google deserves credit for developing something truly original with Material 3 Expressive. Even if it isn’t my favorite design language, it also isn’t an iOS carbon copy like so many Android skins. Samsung didn’t do a bad job either, as the utilitarian elements of One UI 8 seem to match the industrial yet practical design of Galaxy phones.

24,2025-11-19,"Oura is suing Samsung, Zepp Health, Noise, and Reebok for 'unlawful importation and sale of products,' while demanding they pay for smart ring patent licensing.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Oura has sued four new smart ring rivals, including Samsung, for ""unlawful importation and sale of products that infringe on several of Oura’s patents,"" it announced in a blog post on Wednesday.
The lawsuits against Zepp Health, Reebok, and Nexxbase Marketing (aka Indian wearable brand Noise), rely on the same patents it successfully used in a U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) case against Ultrahuman and Ringconn, demanding that they be removed from sale and banned from U.S. imports.
Oura sued Samsung last month in U.S. District Court, claiming that ""after defending multiple unprovoked attacks on its patent portfolio,"" it needed to ""protect its patent rights."" It announced the lawsuit publicly this week.
 



Oura has patented the concept of putting electronic components, such as a flexible printed circuit board, battery, and sensors, between the inner and outer layers of a ring. Unsurprisingly, every competing smart ring uses a similar configuration, as curved components allow a smart ring to remain slim.
""Innovation that moves the category forward is good for the industry and for consumers. At the same time, it’s essential to uphold standards of originality and respect for intellectual property,"" says Oura.
Oura uses these ITC lawsuits to compel rivals to make licensing agreements for its IP, where they make ""royalty payments"" to Oura in exchange for continuing to sell their product in the United States.
 



So far, Circular, Ringconn, and OMATE have fallen in line, and Oura's blog post says royalty-based patent licenses are the ""clear path forward"" for Samsung, Zepp, Reebok, and Noise to ""bring compliant products to market."" Ultrahuman refused to pay for Oura's licensing and is currently appealing an ITC cease-and-desist order against smart ring sales in the U.S.
Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android
Samsung countersued Oura last year, claiming that ""Oura's pattern of indiscriminate assertion of patent infringement against any and all competitors in the smart ring market"" was an ""actual, imminent risk to Samsung."" In other words, it sued Oura before Oura could sue Samsung.
In early 2025, a U.S. federal judge dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that Oura's general statements about enforcing its patents ""were not directed at Samsung"" and ""do not reveal a likelihood or intent to enforce Oura’s patents against Samsung.""
While Samsung had no legal proof of Oura's intent at the time, the recent lawsuit certainly seems to validate their initial claim.
While smaller smart ring brands have been unable to challenge Oura's patents, Samsung has previously stated that these patents are unreasonably broad, claiming ownership of ""features common to virtually all smart rings, such as the inclusion of sensors, electronics, and batteries."" It may attempt to invalidate the patents, rather than pay Oura off.
As for Zepp Health, Reebok, and Noise, they may choose to follow the path of Circular and Ringconn, paying the licensing fee to avoid the threat of a sales ban.

25,2025-11-19,"Blog about Personal Projects, Articles and Papers on Economics, Finance and Technology
In March 2022, as Western nations imposed unprecedented sanctions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Zoltan Pozsar published a series of dispatches that would become some of the most discussed pieces in financial markets that year. The core thesis was stark: we were witnessing the birth of “Bretton Woods III,” a fundamental shift in how the global monetary system operates. Nearly three years later, with more data on de-dollarization trends, commodity market dynamics, and structural changes in global trade, it’s worth revisiting this framework.
I first heard of Pozsar at Credit Suisse during the 2019 repo market disruptions and the March 2020 funding crisis, when his framework explained market dynamics in a way I have never seen it before. Before joining Credit Suisse as a short-term rate strategist, Pozsar spent years at the Federal Reserve (where he created the map of the shadow banking system, which prompted the G20 to initiate regulatory measures in this area) and the U.S. Treasury. His work focuses on what he calls the “plumbing” of financial markets, the often-overlooked mechanisms through which money actually flows through the system. His intellectual approach draws heavily from Perry Mehrling’s “money view,” which treats money as having four distinct prices rather than being a simple unit of account.
Pozsar’s Bretton Woods III framework rests on a straightforward distinction. “Inside money” refers to claims on institutions: Treasury securities, bank deposits, central bank reserves. “Outside money” refers to commodities like gold, oil, wheat, metals that have intrinsic value independent of any institution’s promise.
Bretton Woods I (1944-1971) was backed by gold, outside money. The U.S. dollar was convertible to gold at a fixed rate, and other currencies were pegged to the dollar. When this system collapsed in 1971, Bretton Woods II emerged: a system where dollars were backed by U.S. Treasury securities, inside money. Countries accumulated dollar reserves, primarily in the form of Treasuries, to support their currencies and facilitate international trade.
Pozsar’s argument: the moment Western nations froze Russian foreign exchange reserves, the assumed risk-free nature of these dollar holdings changed fundamentally. What had been viewed as having negligible credit risk suddenly carried confiscation risk. For any country potentially facing future sanctions, the calculus of holding large dollar reserve positions shifted. Hence Bretton Woods III: a system where countries increasingly prefer holding reserves in the form of commodities and gold, outside money that cannot be frozen by another government’s decision.
To understand Pozsar’s analysis, we need to understand his analytical framework. Perry Mehrling teaches that money has four prices: (1) Par: The one-for-one exchangeability of different types of money. Your bank deposit should convert to cash at par. Money market fund shares should trade at $1. When par breaks, as it did in 2008 when money market funds “broke the buck,” the payments system itself is threatened. (2) Interest: The price of future money versus money today. This is the domain of overnight rates, term funding rates, and the various “bases” (spreads) between different funding markets. When covered interest parity breaks down and cross-currency basis swaps widen, it signals stress in the ability to transform one currency into another over time. (3) Exchange rate: The price of foreign money. How many yen or euros does a dollar buy? Fixed exchange rate regimes can collapse when countries lack sufficient reserves, as happened across Southeast Asia in 1997. (4) Price level: The price of commodities in terms of money. How much does oil, wheat, or copper cost? This determines not just headline inflation but feeds through into the price of virtually everything in the economy.
Central banks have powerful tools for managing the first three prices. They can provide liquidity to preserve par, influence interest rates through policy, and intervene in foreign exchange markets. But the fourth price, the price level, particularly when driven by commodity supply shocks, is far harder to control. As Pozsar puts it: “You can print money, but not oil to heat or wheat to eat.”
Pozsar’s contribution was to extend Mehrling’s framework into what he calls the “real domain,” the physical infrastructure underlying commodity flows. For each of the three non-commodity prices of money, there’s a parallel in commodity markets: (1) Foreign exchange ↔ Foreign cargo: Just as you exchange currencies, you exchange dollars for foreign-sourced commodities. (2) Interest (time value of money) ↔ Shipping: Just as lending has a time dimension, moving commodities from port A to port B takes time and requires financing. (3) Par (stability) ↔ Protection: Just as central banks protect the convertibility of different money forms, military and diplomatic power protects commodity shipping routes.
This mapping reveals something important: commodity markets have their own “plumbing” that works parallel to financial plumbing. And when this real infrastructure gets disrupted, it creates stresses that purely monetary policy cannot resolve.
One of the most concrete examples in Pozsar’s March 2022 dispatches illustrates this intersection between finance and physical reality. Consider what happens when Russian oil exports to Europe are disrupted and must be rerouted to Asia. Previously, Russian oil traveled roughly 1-2 weeks from Baltic ports to European refineries on Aframax carriers (ships carrying about 600,000 barrels). The financing required was relatively short-term, a week or two. Post-sanctions, the same oil must travel to Asian buyers. But the Baltic ports can’t accommodate Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs), which carry 2 million barrels. So the oil must first be loaded onto Aframax vessels, sailed to a transfer point, transferred ship-to-ship to VLCCs, then shipped to Asia, a journey of roughly four months.
The same volume of oil, moved the same distance globally, now requires: (a) More ships (Aframax vessels for initial transport plus VLCCs for long-haul). (b) More time (4 months instead of 1-2 weeks). (c) More financing (commodity traders must borrow for much longer terms). (d) More capital tied up by banks (longer-duration loans against volatile commodities).
Pozsar estimated this rerouting alone would encumber approximately 80 VLCCs, roughly 10% of global VLCC capacity, in permanent use. The financial implication: banks’ liquidity coverage ratios (LCRs) increase because they’re extending more term credit to finance these longer shipping durations. When commodity trading requires more financing for longer durations, it competes with other demands for bank balance sheet. If this happens simultaneously with quantitative tightening (QT), when the central bank is draining reserves from the system, funding stresses become more likely. As Pozsar noted: “In 2019, o/n repo rates popped because banks got to LCR and they stopped lending reserves. In 2022, term credit to commodity traders may dry up because QT will soon begin in an environment where banks’ LCR needs are going up, not down.”
One aspect of the framework that deserves more attention relates to dollar funding for non-U.S. banks. According to recent Dallas Fed research, banks headquartered outside the United States hold approximately $16 trillion in U.S. dollar assets, comparable in magnitude to the $22 trillion held by U.S.-based institutions. The critical difference: U.S. banks have access to the Federal Reserve’s emergency liquidity facilities during periods of stress. Foreign banks do not have a U.S. dollar lender of last resort. During the COVID-19 crisis, the Fed expanded dollar swap lines to foreign central banks precisely to address this vulnerability, about $450 billion, roughly one-sixth of the Fed’s balance sheet expansion in early 2020. The structural dependency on dollar funding creates ongoing vulnerabilities. When dollars become scarce globally, whether due to Fed policy tightening, shifts in risk sentiment, or disruptions in commodity financing, foreign banks face balance sheet pressures that can amplify stress. The covered interest parity violations that Pozsar frequently discusses reflect these frictions: direct dollar borrowing and synthetic dollar borrowing through FX swaps theoretically should cost the same, but in practice, significant basis spreads persist.

A major national security debate is unfolding, and it affects more than government networks. It touches your home, your devices and the Wi-Fi your family uses every day. The Commerce Department has proposed blocking new sales of TP-Link products after a months-long review into the company’s ties to China, citing a growing TP-Link security risk.
Multiple agencies, including the Departments of Homeland Security and War, supported that proposal. They believe the company’s connections could expose American networks to foreign influence.
Security experts warn that foreign-backed hackers have targeted home and office routers for years. These devices often act as silent steppingstones that help attackers move deeper into sensitive systems. When compromised, they can expose everything connected to them, including computers, smart home gear, military devices used on base and more.
This potential ban would be one of the biggest consumer tech actions in U.S. history. It comes as lawmakers raise fresh alarms about Chinese-made cameras, routers and connected home products sold on military exchanges and in homes across the country.

CHINESE HACKERS BREACH US NUCLEAR SECURITY AGENCY IN CYBERATTACK OPERATION, OFFICIALS SAY
The proposed TP-Link ban stems from growing concerns that foreign-linked routers and cameras could expose American homes and networks to outside influence. (Kurt ""CyberGuy"" Knutsson)
Lawmakers from both parties say military households face extra risk. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, who leads a bipartisan group of 23 lawmakers, warns that TP-Link cameras and networking devices sold on Army, Navy and Air Force exchange sites could expose sensitive footage from base housing and dorms. Rep. Ashley Hinson, R-Iowa, echoed that concern, saying these devices could act as a backdoor for Chinese intelligence to collect information on service members and their families. Even when products appear out of stock, officials worry they remain popular in military communities.
These lawmakers say Chinese laws could force companies to share data or push hidden software changes that weaken U.S. networks. They argue that this creates a real risk for households on or near military installations. While TP-Link disputes every allegation and states that it stores U.S. data inside America, lawmakers want a deeper investigation.
""China will use any way to infiltrate us, and we must ensure they cannot access our homeland or military bases,"" said Ernst. ""High-tech security cameras sending video and audio directly back to Beijing must be treated like the grave threat that they are. We have seen this playbook from China before, with Huawei Technologies, and need the Trump administration to investigate and determine if TP-Link is a Trojan horse compromising our national security.""
10M AMERICANS HIT IN GOVERNMENT CONTRACTOR DATA BREACH
Ernst is pressing the Commerce Department to finish its investigation by Nov. 30. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, says TP-Link could give the Chinese government access to American networks and wants faster action. Their concerns reflect past decisions involving Huawei and Kaspersky, which lost access to the U.S. market due to national security risks.
Congressional leaders say foreign-made smart home devices sold on military bases should face strict scrutiny. They see routers, cameras and other connected home gear as critical targets in a time when cyberthreats continue to grow.
We reached out to TP-Link Systems Inc., and a spokesperson provided CyberGuy with the following statement:
""TP-Link Systems Inc. (TP-Link), an American company based in California, refutes the claims in this letter. This letter repeats false and misleading media reports and attacks that have been thoroughly debunked.""
""TP-Link emphatically objects to any allegation it is tied to the Communist Party of China, dependent on the Chinese government, or otherwise subject to interference under Chinese national security laws,"" the TP-Link spokesperson said. ""The company is not controlled by any government, foreign or domestic. TP-Link has split from and has no affiliation with the China-based TP-LINK Technologies Co. Ltd., which is separately owned and operated.
Lawmakers warn that TP-Link devices sold on military bases may put service members and their families at greater risk, especially inside base housing. (John Moore/Getty Images)
""This letter has nothing to do with security and everything to do with a competitor trying to remove TP-Link Systems’ products from the marketplace. The ‘open source information’ the members reference is actually a manufactured echo chamber of false and misleading attacks that the media has parroted over the past year. Instead of directly engaging with TP-Link Systems, these members essentially pressed ‘copy and paste’ on unsubstantiated claims about our American company.
""TP-Link has not been contacted by policymakers to discuss the alleged concerns, but if we were to meet with them, they would learn that TP-Link has located its core security functions and data infrastructure in the United States. U.S. user data is securely stored on Amazon Web Services infrastructure in Virginia, under the full control of the company’s U.S. operations.
""TP-Link Systems currently holds a very small share of the U.S. security camera market, representing approximately 3% of the consumer market segment according to Circana checkout data. The company has virtually no business presence in the enterprise segment. Additionally, TP-Link Systems' router market share in the U.S. has been inaccurately reported as being much higher than it actually is. Recent market research from Dell’Oro Group, Inc., found that TP-Link Systems' market share of residential Wi-Fi router sales in North America is under 10%.
""TP-Link does not enable foreign surveillance of U.S. networks or users. The company’s operations are built to prevent potential attempts to subvert its business by outside influence. TP-Link’s substantial security investments cover its entire product portfolio, including security cameras and routers.
""TP-Link continually monitors its products and services and takes timely and appropriate action to address vulnerabilities it becomes aware of. TP-Link has not identified any reliable information regarding new vulnerabilities in its products in connection with this letter.""

YouTube TV and Disney finally reached a new multi-year agreement after a two-week standoff that left almost 10 million subscribers without access to Disney's channels. And now the streaming giant is trying to woo its lost subscribers with a promo. The new deal brings back all the channels, including ESPN, ABC, and more, to the streaming platform.
This 15-day blackout created unnecessary disruptions for subscribers who were caught in the middle of these streaming giants. YouTube TV did issue credits to its users for the inconvenience caused.
But the timing of it all was particularly disruptive for sports fans, who missed major live sports programming on ESPN and ABC, including college football matchups, NBA, and NFL games.
This, in turn, caused several subscribers to ditch the platform to look for other means to watch these sports events. According to several reports, a significant percentage of YouTube TV's estimated 10 million subscribers either cancelled or considered cancelling their service during the blackout.
The subscribers who left the service started getting emails from YouTube TV asking them to return for $60 off the first month, according to a user on Reddit (as spotted by 9to5 Google).
With the base plan costing $82.99, this discount slashed the first month's cost to just $22.99, a huge incentive for people who come back. Several people on the Reddit thread confirm getting these emails, but a few users who canceled their subscriptions haven't seen them yet.
 



This move only goes to show that YouTube TV is clearly prioritizing the recovery of lost subscribers, as evidenced by this ""win-back"" approach—one of the streaming industry's most aggressive tactics.

In other news, YouTube TV’s lower-cost sports bundle is possibly coming next year; however, MLB.TV, a crucial sports add-on for cord-cutters, will not be in the new bundle.
Major League Baseball made a separate deal to move MLB.TV into the ESPN app starting in 2026, consolidating its out-of-market games under ESPN's direct-to-consumer platform instead of third parties like YouTube TV. This means YouTube TV, despite carrying more ESPN content, will not offer MLB.TV.

Hot Stocks 



Fear & Greed Index 




            Latest Market News 




            Hot Stocks 




            Growing concerns about an artificial intelligence bubble have, in large part, caused the stock market’s recent bout of volatility. So the AI industry will face an enormous test when Nvidia, the world’s most valuable company and backbone of the AI boom, reports earnings after the bell on Wednesday.
    

            The stock market rally — ﻿that had been going practically nonstop since April until this month’s blip — largely depends on Nvidia. The chipmaker, which is the gold standard for AI computing power, has propelled the market higher across the past three years.
    

            Investors are now eager to know whether demand for Nvidia’s chips — and its optimism about the future — are continuing to grow or if there are signs of AI fatigue.
    

            Earnings this month from tech company Palantir (PLTR), which uses AI for its government contracts, beat Wall Street’s estimates. However, concerns about the stock’s expensive valuation and nerves about a bubble gave investors pause — and fueled a sell-off in AI stocks over the past several weeks. Nvidia’s stock (NVDA) has fallen more than 8% this month, although it’s still up 37% this year.
    

            “The market for the first time is questioning whether the hype will turn into reality,” Bob Elliott, CIO at asset management firm Unlimited Funds, told CNN.
    

            Nvidia’s chips power part of practically every major AI venture, meaning investors will scrutinize its earnings as well as chief executive Jensen Huang’s remarks.
    

            “Nvidia takes on even greater weight than normal,” Elliott said. “If it doesn’t confirm high expectations built into the market, then watch out below.”
    

            Every investor should care about Nvidia’s earnings this afternoon: Nvidia accounts for roughly 8% of the S&P 500, which is weighted by market value. That means investors — and those with 401(k)s — are increasingly exposed to the company’s strong gains. Similarly, they are more exposed to a drop in Nvidia’s stock price.
    

            As of Tuesday, Nvidia shares’ gains have accounted for 18% of the S&P 500’s total return this year, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.
    

            Since Nvidia last reported earnings in August, concerns have been rising about circular financing, with tech companies entwined in a massive web of extraordinarily lucrative deals.
    

            Now nerves are fraying about whether the money being poured into the AI boom will be justified. On top of that, tech stocks have become relatively expensive.
    

            “Nvidia’s earnings on Wednesday are particularly important given the rising skepticism regarding the longevity of the AI cycle and current AI stock valuations,” James Demmert, CIO at Main Street Research, said in an email. “Anything less than a stellar report and outlook could make stock indexes vulnerable.”
    

            And it’s bigger than just Wall Street. There are concerns that the AI boom — which has helped boost US economic growth this year — is now masking signs of weakness in the economy.
    

            At its market value of $4.4 trillion, Nvidia is currently larger than every country’s economy except the United States, China and Germany.
    

            Nvidia’s fate is interlinked with other big tech companies that depend on its products. A sign of a slowdown in demand could signal that the other tech companies are less confident about the AI buildout. 
    

            Some Wall Street analysts are optimistic that Nvidia will continue to deliver impressive earnings. AI chatbots like ChatGPT — and the data centers powering AI — depend on the company’s chips. It’s the foundation of the current AI wave.
    

            “That is why everyone listens to every word that Jensen Huang has to say, because it’s a good gauge of the health of the AI ecosystem,” said Angelo Zino, a tech analyst at CFRA Research.

34,2025-11-19,"Regardless of your price range, here are the three handheld gaming PCs I recommend most. 

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Based on my hours and hours of experience with several different handheld gaming PCs, I can easily boil down everything I know to three major choices — best budget, best mid-range, and best premium handheld.
If you're willing to spring for it, the Xbox Ally X is my top recommendation of all three, and it happens to be the premium handheld on this list. If you don't need the most powerful handheld and want to save some money, then the Steam Deck LCD is an excellent low-cost option.
BTW, I've previously gone into depth about the very best gaming handhelds on the market today, if you want a more in-depth read.
This is largely a matter of opinion. If you want a simple interface and want to save money, the Steam Deck is the best budget buy. If you're willing to spend more for a more powerful device that can run more games, then the Xbox Ally X is the ideal premium option. Meanwhile, if you'd like something that isn't as costly but still offers better internals than Steam Deck, then the Legion Go S (SteamOS) is the perfect mid-range handheld. 
The ROG Xbox Ally X has a $999.99 MSRP. There is also a less powerful Xbox Ally (non-X), which sells for $599.99 at various tech retailers, including Best Buy.
There are currently three configurations for the Steam Deck. The Steam Deck LCD with 256GB sells for $399.00. The Steam Deck OLED with 512GB sells for $549.00, and the Steam Deck OLED with 1TB sells for $649.00 at Steam. 
There are two configurations of the Legion Go S (SteamOS). The starting price for one with a Z2 Go chip, 16GB RAM, and 512GB SSD is $649.99 at Best Buy. The more premium offering sells for $899.99 at Best Buy, and has a Z1 Extreme chip, 32GB RAM, and 1TB SSD.
That depends on preference and how you want to use your handheld. Both operating systems have their pros and cons. SteamOS has a simpler interface and far less bloat, while Windows handhelds make it easier to access other game services other than Steam right out of the box.
Yes! You can follow our step-by-step guide on how to put SteamOS on a Windows handheld gaming PC. 
Variable refresh rate makes it so that a device's screen better matches the refresh rate of the source GPU in order to provide smoother gameplay with less screen tearing. Devices with VRR often run games more smoothly than handhelds without VRR. 
This really depends on how you like to use your handheld and the kind of games you like to play. Touchpads can make it easier to interact with certain menus, but they aren't exactly ideal for first-person shooters. If you are planning to play a game that benefits from fine cursor controls, then a touchpad might be important for you. Otherwise, joysticks might serve your needs just fine.

35,2025-11-19,"If you’re in the market for an excellent 3-in-1 charging stand ahead of the holiday season, Anker’s new 3-in-1 Prime MagSafe charger could be an excellent pick. It offers 25W MagSafe charging with Qi2.2 support, as well as support for Apple Watch and AirPods – making it an excellent pick for Apple users.
There’s plenty of MagSafe charging stands on the market, but not many of them support Qi2.2 with 25W of charging. This Anker Prime 3-in-1 does, meaning you can take advantage of the highest charging speeds on supported iPhone 16 and iPhone 17 models.
The Anker Prime 3-in-1 comes in at $229.99, which is a rather hefty price tag for sure. That said, it comes with some nifty features that help justify that price tag.
For one, it offers a premium build. The fantastic unboxing presentation and the hefty feel back that up. The Anker Prime 3-in-1 doesn’t feel cheap, and its stainless steel arms look quite sleek. It also comes with a 65W charging brick and cable in the box, so you won’t need to purchase anything else to get started.
Build aside though, it also offers a pretty cool built-in display that offers charging information for each of your three connected devices. You can easily monitor your total power output, as well as the wattage being used by each of your devices.
For the iPhone MagSafe ring, it offers an adjustable hinge, so you can freely rotate your iPhone up and down as needed. This is a big plus point, as many chargers on the market leave your iPhone in a fixed position. 
This MagSafe ring also includes a fan, ensuring your device doesn’t overheat whilst charging – a common issue while wireless charging. This means your phone will charge faster, and the battery will degrade less.
Overall, if you’re looking to expand your MagSafe ecosystem, or are just looking for a nice 3-in-1 MagSafe charging option for your nightstand or whatnot – the Anker Prime 3-in-1 is a fantastic choice to consider. It offers everything you’ll need to charge your iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods, all while looking sleek and supporting the fastest wireless charging standards.
You can purchase the Anker Prime 3-in-1 MagSafe charging stand for $229.99 on Amazon, in either Phantom Gray or White.

Black Friday is still a week away, but you donât have to wait for the main event to start saving. Plenty of early deals are live across a wide range of categories at almost all big retailers, which also makes it a great time to grab some premium laptops for less.
We just spotted the 15-inch Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 going for $650 on Amazon, after 35% off its retail price of $999. Itâs a powerful and reliable option for both everyday work and play, but the offer is only around for a short time. Act fast before the price shoots back up. Thereâs no telling if the discount will be back for the main sale event, or if the stock will last till then.
See at Amazon
Itâs a slim laptop, but the build quality is seriously impressive. The military-grade, durable build protects it from everyday wear and tear well, while also keeping it lightweight enough to carry around with you on the go. Open it up and youâre greeted with a nice 15.3-inch WUXGA display thatâs both bright and spacious. Visuals stay clean and sharp for all your content, plus the anti-glare coating keeps reflections at bay. You can use the screen comfortably in both bright and dim settings.
The full-size numeric keyboard makes typing long documents a breeze. Itâs not backlit, but since the screen is quite bright, you wonât really have a problem using it after the shadows fall. The machineâs also got a high-quality 720p HD camera paired with an integrated digital microphone for crisp video calls. You will look your best and be heard properly, too.
Performance-wise, the laptop runs on an efficient AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS processor that can handle all your everyday tasks like a pro. The 24GB DDR5 SDRAM lets you multitask without slowing down, and the built-in 1TB SSD makes it easy to store all your work documents, media content, programs, and even games at a single place.
Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, plus a whole bunch of ports, including two USB-A (USB 5Gbps / USB 3.2 Gen 1), one USB-C (USB 5Gbps / USB 3.2 Gen 1), with USB PD 3.0 and DisplayPort 1.2, one HDMI 1.4, one Headphone/microphone combo jack (3.5mm), one SD card reader, and one Power connector. Windows 11 Pro also comes pre-installed, so the laptop will be ready to use right out of the box.

37,2025-11-19,"Business Insider's amazing Google reporter Hugh Langley has been playing (er… working) with Google's new Gemini 3 AI service this week.
This is the latest big AI model release, competing with OpenAI's GPT-5, xAI's Grok 4, and the latest offerings from Anthropic.
Gemini 3 is getting good reviews so far. So good that Google shares hit a record on Wednesday, putting the company's market value very close to Microsoft.
Here are Hugh's initial thoughts, after trying Gemini 3 out for a day or so:
""I think where Gemini 3 is most impressive—and where it's already grabbing attention—is its ability to create new things from whole cloth, thanks to improved multimodal and coding capabilities.""
Gemini 3 is particularly good at designing interactive simulations. That could be interesting for visual learning, building websites and apps, or just having fun, Hugh told me.
He played with this new model in a Google sandbox called AI Studio. It's like a real sandbox, but for developers. And it's digital, giving access to Google's AI offerings via the internet. There's no real sand.
Hugh started with something basic: an interactive website about elephants.
""I asked Gemini to include lots of fun widgets and trivia about the animal, but little else. I wanted to see how much Gemini would fill in the gaps.""
While the overall website design was a little sparse, it delivered. Hugh liked this little widget that generated a fun elephant fact every time he pressed a button.
""It also included a mini game where I had to feed the elephant by giving it peanuts,"" Hugh said. ""Once I filled the bar, a pop-up message informed me the elephant was now happy, so that's nice.""
Being able to visualize complex ideas is an area where AI could be particularly useful. Hugh asked Gemini 3 to create an interactive website to explain photosynthesis.
""Gemini generated some sliders to adjust the levels of sunlight, water and carbon dioxide that were floating around as different colored particles,"" he said. ""If I got the balance correct, it told me I had successfully created energy!""
Hugh hadn't generated energy. In fact, that Gemini 3 model run probably sucked up quite a bit of power. Still, pretty impressive.
Other Gemini 3 users are creating interesting new things. Hugh liked this idea to have Gemini build a Lego creator, through a simple prompt such as ""Create a 3D Lego builder. Let me select different shapes of brick.""
Here's an example. Hugh was able to replicate his own version.
I asked Gemini 3 Pro to create a 3D LEGO editor.In one shot it nailed the UI, complex spatial logic, and all the functionality. We’re entering a new era. pic.twitter.com/Y7OndCB8CK
Then, there are all the video games that users are getting Gemini 3 to create. Jeff Dean, one of Google's top AI researchers, posted several clips of these games.
Also, we're exploring new ways to create games using Gemini 3 - we've created and published a few experimental YouTube Playables.Each of the games shown in the video below was created by Gemini 3 from scratch w/a few natural language prompts/images.Try them out at… pic.twitter.com/lT59AUXfgT
Hugh gave this a shot, too. This required a bit more back-and-forth with Gemini to get right.
He wanted to make ""Super Dario Land,"" a game where the player has to get Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei into the correct warp pipe. If they succeed, the player is rewarded with AGI (the theoretical moment when machines outperform humans on most tasks).
Hugh asked Gemini to style it like one of Nintendo's old Game Boy games.
""At first, Dario couldn't jump high enough, so I asked Gemini to fix that,"" Hugh told me. ""With one extra prompt, the physics were solved!""
The game was very quickly playable as Gemini did the work of mapping the controls to Hugh's computer keyboard without any direction from him.
""The game itself might not be a hit, but I'm leaving the door open for a sequel. Dario, call me!"" Hugh said.
If anyone wants to play Hugh's game, send him an email at hlangley@businessinsider.com. It's fun!

AI has already disrupted coding. Finance could be next, according to Cohere CEO Aidan Gomez.
""Finance will come,"" Gomez told Kleiner Perkins partner Joubin Mirzadegan on a recent episode of the firm's ""Grit"" podcast.
Cohere, a Toronto-based AI startup focused on enterprise applications, is already doing some work in the financial sector through partnerships with RBC and TD Bank. Both partnerships are built on Cohere's LLM models. After it closed its latest round of funding in September, Cohere was valued at roughly $7 billion.
Gomez, who co-authored the famous 2017 paper ""Attention Is All You Need"" while he was an intern at Google Brain, said that AI's power lies in its ability to augment white-collar work, a view widely shared throughout Silicon Valley and the AI industry. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has said that he's worried that AI could wipe out up to half of entry-level, white-collar jobs in the next one to five years.
""You have to pay them a lot because there's not a lot of these people for the world,"" Gomez said. ""And so there's tons of demand for these people, but there's not enough of those people to do the work the world needs. And it turns out that these models are best at the types of things those people do.""
AI's effects are already being felt in software engineering, where powerful tools like Cursor, along with frontier models like Claude and ChatGPT, allow users to ""vibe code"" software without any specialized coding knowledge. Other industries, including finance, legal, and publishing, are still in varying degrees of the early days of AI disruption.
""It's still so early for the enterprise,"" Gomez said. ""We're still doing the super foundational, super — Summarize this email for me. Summarize these meeting notes for me. It's so basic, low-level. I just think there's so much to be done.""
Mirzadegan said the next step of AI is the ability to ""augment people.""
""I mean, isn't that the whole point of this? We're eating a different part of the market where it's not seats and licenses,"" he said. ""It's being able to actually augment people, actually do the jobs of people in many ways, and that's so much more transformative.""
Business Insider has sued Cohere, and that litigation is ongoing.""

39,2025-11-19,"“Build a better mousetrap and the world will beat a path to your door,” so goes the saying, but VHS beat Betamax and the world hasn’t been the same since. In any case, you might not get rich building a better mousetrap, but you can certainly create something more humane than the ol’ spring’n’snap, as [nightcustard] demonstrates.
The concept is the same as many humane mousetraps on the market. The mouse is lured into a confined cavity with the use of bait, and once inside, a door closes to keep the mouse inside without injuring it. [nightcustard] achieved this by building a plastic enclosure with plenty of air holes, which is fitted with a spring-loaded door. When a mouse walks through an infra-red break beam sensor, a Raspberry Pi Pico W triggers a solenoid which releases the door, trapping the mouse inside. This design was chosen over a passive mechanical solution, because [nightcustard] noted that mice in the attic were avoiding other humane traps with obvious mechanical trigger mechanisms.
As a bonus, the wireless connectivity of the Pi Pico W allows the trap to send a notification via email when it has fired. Thus, you can wake up in the morning and check your emails to see if you need to go and release a poor beleaguered mouse back into the wild. This is critical, as otherwise, if you forget to check your humane trap… it stops being humane pretty quickly.
If you’re looking for more inspiration to tackle your mouse problems, we can help. We’ve featured other traps of this type before, too. Meanwhile, if you’ve got your own friendly homebrew solutions to pesky pest problems, don’t hesitate to hit up the tipsline.
Overnight is still not good. I have had mice die from stress in less than 4 hours, and switched to snap and break the neck traps. No, not in an open or high traffic area, but a closed off attic, where every other fall a few find a way in.
I am wondering what are they going to do with the live mouse afterwards?
If they are drowning it in water, or using CO2 (recommended “humane” way), to kill it, then a snap and break the neck trap would like be more humane… (quicker and less suffering).
You don’t have to kill things you know. You can always take the outside things that found their way inside and take them back outside a ways away.
“You can always take the outside things that found their way inside and take them back outside a ways away.”
With meeces it needs to be about 3-5 miles, or over a major highway [frogger], as they will absolutely try to reseek their home.
Don’t  forget the stress the animal will feel being moved to an unknown area, or that it was potentially born inside your house and you are ‘wilding’ it to the peregrins, or that it might well just go into someone else’s home and get snapped anyway.
More humane to just snap it’s neck fast and quick.
So it’s more humane to kill it without a chance than to at least give it a chance to survive. I love your mindset, you are probably very fun at parties.
@sweethack
It depends on which one you find more “humane”: death or torture.
Death or torture?
Cats ask ‘Why not both?’
The most magnificent gift I’ve ever received?
A headless squirrel?
Thought that counts…
Baba Yaga gave me the his favorite thing (was likely full).
He usually ate the best bits before leaving the rest for me, but that once I even got the liver.
Too bad it was too far gone to make a stew, I snuck it into the trash while he wasn’t looking.
You don’t need to keep pests alive, you know? Mice are pests. They destroy your house and furniture, contaminate your food, their feces contains deadly bacteria, they host several diseases, they are fierce predators responsible for several bird species being extinct, and maybe you have heard of the Black Plague somewhere.
Why endanger your own family over a mouse? Kill it, as quick as you can. Catch and release just throws the problem on your neighbor’s house. You don’t need to make them suffer for the sake of it, but thinking they are nice fluffy innocent animals is naïve…
Hmm… now that you say this, I might experiment with loading live mice into a potato gun and firing them over at neighbour properties. Could be a quite kinky and fun way to spend summer afternoon.
Mine went to the furthest corner of the garden, where there are natural cover, and AFAICT there were no returns.
Notes:
Several species of mice are protected were I live.
Rolled oats works well and lasts long in a dry space.
I would love to see a Rube Goldenberg mouse trap, including pneumatic tubing, to deliver the critter to the furthest corner of the garden.
“Here’s a fax from Cooter in Orlando…’In retrospect, lighting the match was my big mistake”
‘Cooter’ is a great word.
Depending on context, it can mean ‘alligator’ or ‘vagina’ (‘gator or ‘giner).
Also a common nick name, less common legal name.
Southern bells have fearsome Kegel muscles.
Woody word, very woody.
Prefer ‘snap’. Done.
maybe they have a pet snake.
Feeding a live mouse to a pet snake is cruel to the mouse and risks injuring the snake.
or as i call it, a natural meal for a snake and a natural death for a mouse. nature is very metal.
First you have to break the mouse’s legs so the snake doesn’t get hurt by swallowing a kicking live mouse. So doubly cruel to the mouse…
I feed mine to the kookaburras. If you’re trapping them, they have to be relocated a few km to ensure they don’t return and continue to defecate and urinate all over the kitchen and pantry, looking for tiny scraps of food that I’ve missed when cleaning up after dinner. No-one’s perfect and I dare anyone to claim their kitchen is both pristine and mouse-proof. I’ve even observed teeth-marks on tupperware containers of bread and rice. They’re persistent little buggers.
Risks injuring the snake? No, it really doesn’t.
Snakes eat mice outside your house, in the forest/woods. Is that cruel or risky for snakes?
If you’ve ever seen a snake in action you wouldn’t use the term “risky” referring to the snake.
Actually, it can. Snakes eat things alive, alive things tend to kick and struggle when they are eaten alive. My pet snake keeping neighbor broke the legs of live mice before feeding them to the snake. The big issue is eye damage and infection risk according to him.
I CO2ed a mouse once and I found it very unpleasant. I searched online for a humane way to kill the mouse, and it was pretty rough.
Only thing worse was having to put a gecko out of its misery after it got stuck on a cockroach glue trap that the building contractor placed. I actually cried when I couldn’t get it unstuck and decided a quick blow with a frying plan would be the most humane way to end the suffering.
You could use acetone or some brake cleaner to dissolve the glue.
Vegetable oil will unstick critters from glue traps.

I got to kill, clean, cook and eat a chicken on a riverbank in middle school.
IIRC it was part of an ‘Outward Bound’ class.
Hippie teachers were trying to uncityfy and smarten the kids.
The best way is to grab the chicken by the head and spin your hand in a small circle until the head pops off.
Better then cracking them like a whip, though they run further with the whip method.
When I design life support systems I always include more CO2 absorber than O2. This way once life support consumables run out the crew dies of nitrogen narcosis (happy) rather than CO2 poisoning (unhappy, painful, splitting headaches, unable to breath, etc.).
The paradox of “humane” is that it’s more about appeasing the human than providing a painless and stress-free death to the animal.
The concern for animal welfare arises out of the empathy that we have towards each other – a biological trait that ensures co-behavior – because perceived pain in others causes pain in us. That pain is imaginary, so as long as you can pretend that the animal is happy, you’re fine. Whether there is  suffering, and whether it matters in a deeper philosophical sense, is a secondary concern that is usually ignored.  The “bad thing that’s happening” is not that the animal is hurt, but that I am hurt.
just get a cat and leave the torture-murder to an animal that will actually enjoy it. the cats have a better health care plan than i do, they will be fine.
Ah, but then you get animal rights activists up in arms about how keeping a cat indoors is torture and letting it outside is murder and you’re complicit in it.
Cats in the wild though – see no evil, hear no evil…
I preferred VHS over Betamax for its 6+ hour tapes for time-shifting.
That’s mainly why VHS won – longer recording time.  Tape handling for Betamax was better and a multi-generation copy of copy test showed its recording quality was better without a need for test equipment to show that.
humans, when given multiple options, will inevitably gravitate to the worst one.
Porn is why VHS won.
Don’t overcomplicate it.
Even today I keep all my child porn on VHS. It can’t be detected by the OS kernel (be it Win32, Linux or Android) so it’s safer to watch.
i usually just have my cat take care of these guys. they wont kill it, but they will let it loose in the house.
Betamax wasn’t better. Betacam was better, but it was a professional standard, not a consumer one. Here’s the Technology Connections video about it: https://youtu.be/hGVVAQVdEOs
Video2000 from Philips (and Grundig too) was the 3rd option, superior in many ways but often not mentioned. Not well known across the pond, due to the fact that is was a system that focused on the PAL format. For more info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_2000
It’s missing an elevator music so the mouse knows at some point it’ll arrive somewhere. It’s more humane that storing an animal in a closed box for a given period, look that’s how human does it.
Gives the mouse a safe place to hides from the cat, because the cat seems go for maximum stress and suffering, over a long period for maximum entertainment.
its really not entertainment. its a way to protect themselves from infection. rodent bites are often infectious. a mouse when threatened will enter flight of fight mode. given no other choice than to fight, it will fight (mice have probibly read sun tsu). so the cat will minimize contact, fling it across the room, break its limbs, inflict wounds, until it is exhausted and submits to its death. the cat’s goal in all this is simply not to get bit.
A mouse and rat trap channel.  Demonstrates modern and antique traps in use with low light night vision cameras.  Most traps use water to drown the vermin.  Some mechanisms are pretty clever.
Huge RATS Sucked Up With New Rat Vac Trap – 30 Rats At A Time! Amazing New Trap.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-c9vFpKgyg
A dirt simple clever one uses a tilting platform over a five gallon bucket with water in it.  The bait is on the opposite side of the pivot of the tilt platform.  Mouse or rat goes to bait, platform tilts, splash.
Often there is no need to be fancy. Give a mouse a way to get to the top of an empty 2 foot deep plastic planter, no bait required. Mouse jumps or falls into planter, can’t jump high enough to get out, can’t climb up slippery side.
Guess what I find in my sink full of water? Yeah, I wish they wouldn’t do that, but it does work.
Mice are vermin and spread disease. If you aren’t killing them, you are just transporting the mice and any diseases they have to another area to spread further.
If you have mice in your house you need to locate where and how they are getting in and seal up the holes.  Remember, mice spread diseases that can KILL you and your family. Deal with the root of the issue. and seal up their avenues into your house. One mouse can poop, pee and chew on enough stuff to do thousands of dollars or more worth of damages to the things in your home. Even if you have a cat, you should still seal up all the ways they can get in.
I don’t really want to trap a live mouse but i’ve been thinking about building a trap like this one for a long time.  I set up a camera to watch my traps, and i learned that mice and rats are each able to interact with the trap without setting it off.  Rats because they’re smart and mice because they’re light.  And a lot of trap designs are especially insensitive, it’d be almost impossible for a mouse to set them off.  The best ones use a little bent piece of copper as the trigger and those can be very sensitive but they also bend easily and can become over- or under-sensitive from one day to the next.
The pest would go straight to the target but without setting off the trap.  But on the camera, you can see when they’re in position and if the camera could trigger it instead of the mechanical doodad, then it’d be a huge improvement in efficiency / efficacy.  Mice are literally interacting with my trap a dozen times for every capture.  I’m not sure if i could make a camera+servo drive a snap trap effectively, so i’m thinking a plastic tube with a door, just like this one.
Just need to actually do it.  It should be a product.  Wouldn’t it be great if an IoT “innovation” actually improved the function for a change!

Target is betting a billion-dollar facelift will improve its fortunes after a rough couple of years.
The Minneapolis-based retailer posted its earnings on Wednesday, its 10th quarter in the past 12 with negative or flat comparable sales, and cautioned that the critical fourth quarter will likely be down as well.
""We're far from satisfied with our current results, and we won't be satisfied until we're operating at our full potential,"" incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke said in a call with reporters.
Third-quarter comparable sales declined 2.7%, coming in below analysts' estimate of -2.06%. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.78 came in above expectations of $1.73.
Shares of Target's stock were down roughly 3% in pre-market trading following the results.
Fiddelke attributed much of the quarter's shortfall to a sharp drop-off in September, while August and October were relatively flat. Foot traffic data from Placer.ai shows a similar trend during the period.
Target will increase its annual capital expenditures from $4 billion to $5 billion to invest in remodeling and refreshing its store fleet, Fiddelke said, including the biggest changes to its merchandise assortment and floor plans that the company has seen in years.
Heading into the holidays, Fiddelke and Chief Commercial Officer Rick Gomez said shoppers continue to be stretched thin and making trade-offs wherever they can — a theme that has persisted in recent years across many retailers.
Now, Gomez said, Target shoppers are focusing their holiday spending on items they see as core to the spirit of the occasion, choosing Halloween costumes and candy over decor, for example.
""As we go into Christmas and the holidays,"" he added, ""we think the consumer will prioritize what goes under the tree versus what goes on the tree.""
The chain has weathered declines in both the number of transactions and the size of those transactions, and Fiddelke said improving the in-store experience is key to turning those trends around.
Still, as economic pressures such as inflation, tariffs, and layoffs weigh on shoppers' minds, Target has found itself falling behind its more value-focused competitors like Walmart and Costco. Target's stock price has declined around 35% since the start of the year, compared to Walmart's 12.6% increase and Costco's 1.6% decrease.
""Prices need to be sharp,"" Fiddelke said. ""The consumer is looking for great price, but we know that our lane — what makes Target uniquely special — is pairing that with incredible product.""
The retailer also announced an app integration with ChatGPT that will roll out in beta next week.
""We expect to be one of the first retailers on OpenAI platforms to offer the purchase of multiple items in a single transaction, offer fresh food products on the platform, and the ability to choose drive-up and pick-up fulfillment options,"" Fiddelke said.
Once the excitement of the holiday shopping season is over, Fiddelke will have his work cut out for him as he takes the helm from outgoing CEO Brian Cornell on February 1.
All of it boils down to one goal: ""Target back to growth as quickly as possible.""

Tower Research Capital, one of the biggest names in quantitative trading, has quietly become a player in one of Wall Street's hottest talent races — backing external traders.
In the battle to attract top investment talent, hedge funds such as Millennium, Qube, and Schonfeld have increasingly pitched a tantalizing setup to prized candidates: Rather than joining another in-house investing or trading team, they can set up a separate vehicle to run the firm's capital under their own banner.
These arrangements, often structured as ""separately managed accounts,"" or SMAs, have become a shortcut for launching a fund — without the burden of raising money or building infrastructure from scratch. Assets in SMA-style strategies at multistrategy hedge funds rose 27% last year to $315 billion, according to Goldman Sachs, more than double the 2019 level.
But hedge funds aren't the only ones cutting deals with independent portfolio managers.
New York-based Tower, founded in 1998 by former Credit Suisse trader Mark Gorton, began experimenting with a twist on the SMA years before the recent frenzy, and the practice has gained traction at the firm in recent years, Business Insider has learned.
Instead of an SMA, Tower offers select recruiting targets what it calls a ""Software Vendor Agreement,"" or SVA, to quants that might otherwise set up their own trading firms. The deals vary by team, but the basic contours are the same, people familiar with the contracts said: External teams keep control of their intellectual property and brand while using Tower's technology, connections, and capital — and sharing any profits they generate.
Tower's embrace of external trading teams underscores how the line between hedge funds — which invest on behalf of clients — and prop-trading firms — which trade their own money — is increasingly blurring.
Tower isn't the only prop trading firm to have backed external quant PMs, according to several prop-trading insiders, but it is among the largest and most prolific. The firm signed its first external manager in 2017, according to people familiar with the matter, and Tower now works with more than 10 external trading teams under SVAs, one of the people said.
One recent example is Pierre Laffitte, a former Jump Trading quant who launched his London-based firm LQT Technologies last year under a Tower SVA, according to people familiar with the deal. (Laffitte did not respond to requests for comment.)
A Tower spokesperson declined to comment.
Top prop firms like Jane Street, Citadel Securities, and Hudson River Trading rose to prominence in the 2010s for their high-frequency trading and affinity for secrecy. But many firms reaped a windfall from pandemic-era volatility and have been in expansion mode since, edging into medium-frequency quant strategies long considered the dominion of hedge funds.
Those efforts have paid off: prop firms have notched record profits in 2025 amid renewed market turbulence.
At Tower, which has over 1,100 employees and 12 offices around the world, mid-frequency trading now accounts for 25% to 30% of the business and is growing, one person with knowledge of the matter said.
Tower has also gone further than its peers in crossing into hedge fund territory. The firm is preparing to launch Tower Research Asset Management, its first vehicle for outside investor capital, the Financial Times reported. The launch could come in 2026.
Internally, Tower already operates more like a multistrategy hedge fund than most of its peers, with distinct trading teams — including Latour Trading or Limestone — responsible for their own PNL.
The upshot of a plug-and-play deal with Tower for a quant trader or researcher is straightforward. With Tower's capital and resources, including access to exchanges across the world, they can accelerate their timeline to turning a profit and potentially amplify their earnings.
One industry expert familiar with the arrangements, who asked to remain anonymous to protect business relationships, said even fairly simplistic quant strategies can cost tens of millions to get up and running, not to mention all the other aspects of building a company unrelated to developing profitable trading strategies.
An external agreement like an SVA allows the PM to maintain some operational independence and IP ownership but also to ""de-risk by having all of the structural elements of the company set up for you day one so you can put your head down and focus on alpha generation.""
The setup mirrors many of the benefits of an SMA, but the structures differ in key ways.
Prop firms face different regulatory oversight since they do not manage funds on behalf of clients. In an SMA, a PM is typically managing assets as an investment adviser and has a fiduciary responsibility to the client.
An SVA, by contrast, is a commercial technology or services deal. The external quant team licenses trading algorithms or strategies to Tower, people familiar with the structures said, which implements them with its own capital and shares a cut of the profits. Regulatory requirements can vary based on market jurisdiction and the assets being traded.
A quant team on an SVA doesn't necessarily trade Tower's money exclusively, but some do, a person familiar said.
For Tower, the SVA has become a helpful tool to lure more established quants who may already have IP or even profitable trading strategies, people close to the firm said.
In addition to LQT Technologies — which had 10 employees and planned to start trading in September, according to a LinkedIn post by Laffitte — other Tower-linked teams include:
""It's a mechanism to bring in people they otherwise wouldn't have access to hire,"" one person close to the firm said.

47,2025-11-19,"Black Friday is about a week away, but that hasn't stopped retailers from offering an excellent assortment of early discounts, including great savings on Apple products. As Insider Reviews' Senior Tech Editor, I monitor pricing on various gadgets year-round, so I know a worthwhile sale when I see one. The best early Black Friday Apple deals include a mix of discounts on brand-new devices and record-low prices on older models.
Most notably, the AirPods Pro 2 are now available for just $139 at Walmart, which is the lowest price I've ever seen them sell for. Though the Pro 2 earbuds have been replaced by the newer Pro 3, it's hard to beat a value like that. Meanwhile, Apple's 2025 13-inch MacBook Air is now available for $250 off, which is a record-low price. The brand-new Apple Watch SE 3 is also getting its first substantial sale since it launched in September. You can grab it now for $50 off at Amazon. 
I'll be watching for more early Black Friday Apple deals as we approach the main sale, so make sure to check back for additional savings. And for discounts across other product categories, browse all of our early Black Friday deals coverage.

                      The AirPods Pro 2 have been replaced by Apple's newer AirPods Pro 3, but they remain a great value if you can find them on sale. Although their audio quality, battery life, and noise-canceling capabilities may not match those of the newer model, they still support many of the same great features.
                    

                      The newest MacBook Air models feature an M4 chip, which is one of the most powerful ever included in an Apple computer. Its speed, combined with a sleek design and beautiful screen, makes it a top-tier laptop.
                    

                      This larger 15-inch version of the 2025 MacBook Air uses Apple's M4 processor. It is available in 16GB or 24GB memory configurations with up to 512GB of storage.
                    

                      Apple's newest MacBook Pro model features a 14.2-inch screen and is powered by the brand's latest processor, the M5. Apple says this new chip offers notable gains in graphical and AI performance over the previous-generation MacBook Pro with M4. 
                    

                      The Apple Watch SE 3 marks the most capable generation of the brand's budget smartwatch yet. It now comes powered by the S10 chip, with better battery life, and more.
                    

                      This is the larger version of Apple's latest entry-level smartwatch. It offers powerful S10 chip performance, along with improved battery life compared to the older SE 2 model, and new support for an always-on display. 
                    

                      The SE 2nd Gen has been replaced by the SE 3, but this model remains a solid buy when on sale. Just note that it has an older processor and lacks newer features like an always-on display and sleep apnea notifications.
                    

                      Though it looks very similar to earlier models, the Series 11 Apple Watch includes new gestures and improved battery life compared to its predecessors.
                    

                      What sets the M3 iPad Air apart from its predecessors is its upgraded processor and new video editing features. This larger size is ideal for artists, editors, and any users in need of extra working space compared to the smaller 11-inch version.
                    

                      The new 2025 iPad Pro features Apple's latest-generation chip, the M5, which Apple says offers up to a 3.5x boost in AI performance compared to the last-generation iPad. It also offers a bump in graphical performance for 3D games and applications.   
                    

                      The 13-inch version of Apple's 2025 iPad Pro also utilizes the brand's new M5 chip to deliver enhanced AI and 3D graphics performance compared to previous iPad Pro models.
                    
Absolutely, Black Friday remains one of the best times to score deals on Apple products. Every year, we see some of the lowest prices of the season on MacBooks, iPads, AirPods, and Apple Watches, along with trade-in and carrier deals on iPhones.
In 2025, Black Friday lands on November 28, but several retailers have already started offering deals in the weeks leading up to the main event.
Apple's newest smartwatches are the premium Apple Watch Ultra 3, the midrange Apple Watch Series 11, and the entry-level Apple Watch SE 3. However, the older Ultra 2, Series 10, and SE 2 are still in stock at many stores, and remain good buys when on sale.
You can learn more about each model's features and differences in our Apple Watch Ultra 3 guide and our Apple Watch Series 11 and SE 3 guide.
Apple's current lineup of iPads includes these models:
However, you may still be able to find older iPad models in stock at some stores. You can learn more about the differences between iPad models in our guide to the newest iPads.
Though we don't typically see Black Friday discounts on iPhone models sold on their own, certain carriers often have Black Friday promotions that include big savings on various iPhone models when you sign up for specific coverage plans.
Currently, T-Mobile and Verizon are running promotions that allow eligible customers to receive free iPhones with select plans and conditions. You can learn more in our Black Friday phone deals coverage:

50,2025-11-19,"""I am waiting for the bailiff to knock on the door, take my keys and kick me out,"" says Jose Da Costa Diogo, one of thousands of people who have been told this year their homes will be repossessed.
The 65-year-old learned he would lose his home in Thetford, Norfolk, during a brisk 10-minute county court hearing earlier this year.
The interest-only mortgage on the three-bedroom property was taken out more than 20 years ago in the hope he and his then wife would save up enough to eventually cover the capital sum.
But the collapse of the marriage and his ex-wife's departure to Brazil in 2015, left Mr Da Costa Diogo unable to repay the £80,000 still outstanding.
And because his ex-wife was still on both the mortgage documents and the property deeds, he was also unable to sell the property to cover the outstanding amount.
""I tried to do the right thing and carried on paying all the bills,"" he said. ""After 25 years, I have nothing to show... but I still have to carry on living.
""I'm going to be homeless.""
Court figures show the number of mortgage repossession orders in England and Wales reached 10,853 in 2024-25 - the highest number in five years.
Experts say the rise is down to a variety of factors including interest rate increases and the rise in the general cost of living.
Mr Da Costa Diogo registered as homeless with Breckland Council, his local authority.
He is far from alone.
The BBC asked every English council with housing responsibilities how many people presented as homeless as a result of a mortgage repossession.
The number has doubled, according to the 240 councils that provided comparable data - from 1,517 in 2022-23, to 2,370 in 2023-24.
It was 3,406 in the most recent year.
LIVE: Five minutes to fight for your home: BBC reports from repossession cases across England
People in local government say rehoming those affected by repossessions is putting ever greater stress on council resources.
Tom Hunt, who chairs the Local Government Association's Inclusive Growth Board, said: ""As more and more people turn to their council for help, local authorities are having to stretch budgets further.
""The temporary accommodation crisis facing councils is only worsening.""
Lucy Davies sees the devastation repossessions can have on a daily basis.
A housing law advisor with the Suffolk Law Centre, she volunteers her expertise to those in need at courts in Suffolk and Essex.
""I see the sheer number of people that this is affecting,"" said Ms Davies. 
""People get into difficulties largely through no fault of their own.
""Quite often there's mental health, there's employment issues, there's family issues, and I think it can very quickly spiral out of control.""
On the day the BBC joined Ms Davies for a day at Ipswich County Court, where she volunteers with the Ipswich County Court Advice and Representation Service, none of the five people facing mortgage repossession cases turned up.
This, she said, was often a symptom of shame, despair and the sense that losing one's home is a foregone conclusion.
""It is quite frightening coming to court, but it doesn't have to be.""
She urged people to seek advice as soon as possible and said the cases she was seeing were becoming ""more entrenched or more serious"".
People were finding it increasingly difficult to access housing legal aid, she explained.
Paul Gorton, of The Law Society's housing law committee, agreed.
He said a historic lack of investment in legal aid meant fewer and fewer law firms were able to offer legal aid housing advice.
""Many people are too well off to be eligible for legal aid but cannot afford to pay for legal advice themselves,"" Mr Gorton said.
""We have both legal aid provider deserts and restrictive eligibility criteria leaving many people stuck in limbo.""
A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said it had recently announced ""the first major funding increase for housing legal aid in three decades - a 24% rise"".
""This investment will help ensure effective access to justice for some of the most vulnerable in our society, while supporting a more stable and sustainable legal aid sector,"" the spokesperson said.
Seeking to repossess a home is ""always a last resort"" for lenders, said Karina Hutchins, a principal in the mortgage policy team at UK Finance, a trade association for the banking and financial services sector.
She said while the number of mortgage repossessions had been creeping up in recent years, the current levels remained ""historically low"".
""Repossessions are really, really uncommon.""
She said in the first quarter of 2025, about 2,000 homes were repossessed compared with 13,000 in the same quarter of 2009, in the wake of the 2008 financial crash.
""I can imagine that customers are really worried and distressed if they're facing financial difficulty, but they don't have to go through it alone,"" Ms Hutchins said. 
""The earlier they get in touch with their mortgage lender, the more support and help that that lender can give them and the more likelihood they have of getting back up to date with their mortgage.""
Options offered by lenders, she said, included reduced mortgage payments to allow time to get back on track, budgeting and other tools to understand ""their full financial situation"" and advice about debt charities and support organisations.
Henry Sabati McRae, who lives in Croydon, south London, has so far managed to stave off repossession.
A software developer by training, Mr McRae's financial woes came in the wake of the death of a brother in 2020 and his mother in October 2023.
Since October 2024, the 51-year-old has been out of work and, despite applying for hundreds of jobs, he has not managed to get a new contract. 
""It doesn't matter how much you have in savings,"" he said.
""Within a few months it is wiped out. I managed to stretch it as far as I could, because I'd been quite conservative with how I was doing.""
Even so, the mortgage arrears on his two-bedroom flat eventually grew to about £13,000 and his bank said if that figure was not reduced to below £8,000 it would seek to repossess his home.
""The most important thing for me at that time, and I think for anybody, was keeping the roof over my head,"" he said. ""Otherwise it spirals out of control.""
To scrape by, he has turned to selling off his possessions on an internet auction site and accepting a loan from a friend.
Like many of those facing repossession action the BBC has spoken to, Mr McRae said the experience was deeply ""humiliating"" and that his instincts were initially ""to draw the curtains shut"".
However, he said realising he was far from alone and in speaking about it has helped him plot out, like an IT problem, his ""solution to it"".
Businessman Mike Williams, who lives 10 miles (16km) south of Mr McRae in Caterham, Surrey, has also avoided repossession.
He took on the mortgage of his self-build home after he and his wife separated.
In three years, repayments on the interest-only loan, which was taken out 20 years ago, have tripled.
He says it has left him with ""next to no disposable income"".
At court, he renegotiated a repayment plan which would add an extra 20% to his monthly payments.
In five years, when the mortgage comes to term, he intends to sell the two-bedroom house which he and his wife built from the ground up.
""It has quite a bit of sentimental value to me, so yes it is heart-wrenching,"" he said.
As for Mr Da Costa Diogo, his bank has repossessed the property.
In the same month it was repossessed, the BBC saw a similar three-bedroom property in the same Thetford street as Mr Da Costa Diogo's on the market for £160,000 - almost double the amount he owed.
Within hours of losing his home, he was given emergency accommodation in a small ground-floor studio in north Suffolk.
""I left my house with one suitcase and a bag of essentials and told the council 'I'm homeless'.
""It's a roof over my head. I'm trying to keep things simple because what is the point of complicating things?
""I'm alive and I carry on.""

51,2025-11-19,"If the Galaxy S26 Edge releases, it'll be the polar opposite of the Pixel 10 Pro XL.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

 




An unknown quantity
The Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge, originally rumored to be an ambitious replacement for the Plus model, is now up in the air. If released, it'll be even thinner than the Galaxy S25 Edge while adding battery life and features. 
 




Feature-filled
The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL is crammed with features, almost to a fault. It has magnets inside for Qi2 support, an upgraded Tensor G5 chip, a great display, and Google's best software tricks. However, it's thick and heavy as a result. 
Thin phones might be in, or they might be out. Samsung started a trend with the Galaxy S25 Edge, but it's unclear whether it'll follow up that slim device with a Galaxy S26 Edge. There were leaks pointing to an even slimmer device, others suggesting a cancellation, and more recent ones claiming a Galaxy S26 Edge is on the way after all. Due to reportedly weak demand for the Galaxy S25 Edge, this may not sound surprising.
There are plenty of reasons why the Galaxy S25 Edge might not have been the hit Samsung expected. One of them is that the phone is priced the same as other top flagships, like the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL, while offering fewer features. It's natural that those considering a future Galaxy S26 Edge might pivot to a device such as the Pixel 10 Pro XL.
While key details about the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge are up in the air, let's see how it might compare to Google's best flagship based on current rumors and leaks.
 



Samsung's Galaxy S26 Edge may never be released, but if it does, it'll likely come after the initial Galaxy S26 launch. This would track with the release schedule of the current Galaxy S25 series. The latest Galaxy S25 Edge didn't debut until May 2025, months after the base, Plus, and Ultra models were made available. While earlier leaks suggested the Galaxy S26 Edge might release earlier, more recent rumors reversed course.
When or if the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge debuts, it's expected to cost $1,099, just like the current model. It'll be available in 256GB or 512GB storage configurations and multiple color options. As for specifics or a release date, we don't have those yet.
The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL is widely available as of Aug. 28, 2025. It starts at $1,199 for the model with 256GB of storage, and there are 512GB and 1TB configurations available. You can buy it in Moonstone, Jade, Porcelain, or Obsidian colorways. Keep in mind that the Pixel 10 Pro XL is sold as an eSIM-only phone in the U.S.
 



If you're curious about what the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge might look like, look no further than the iPhone Air. Samsung is rumored to be taking inspiration from the iPhone's camera plateau. There is said to be a large camera bump on the back of the Galaxy S26 Edge, allowing Samsung to make the main body of the device even thinner than the Galaxy S25 Edge.
Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android
However, conflicting reports indicate Samsung is exploring at least two potential prototypes for the Galaxy S26 Edge. One model is claimed to have a 5.5mm thickness, undercutting the current 5.8mm measurement of the Galaxy S25 Edge. It's possible that the variant has been canceled, per a leak, in favor of a different Galaxy S26 Edge prototype.
The more recent leak suggests Samsung has a phone in development with the codename ""More Slim."" This is a clear nod to the ""Slim"" codename that Samsung originally used for the Galaxy S25 Edge. The interesting part is that, according to the report, ""More Slim"" entered development later than the original Galaxy S26 Edge prototype.
So, the Galaxy S26 Edge that eventually releases could end up looking different than the 5.5mm model originally reported.
 



For now, what we do know is that any Galaxy S26 Edge model would have the same 6.7-inch screen size as its predecessor. The underlying display technology will likely remain consistent, too. That means we'll see a 120Hz AMOLED panel with at least 2,600 nits of peak brightness.
The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL has a slightly larger 6.8-inch Super AMOLED screen. It's brighter at 3,300 nits, but offers the same 120Hz refresh rate. Like the Galaxy S26 Edge, the Pixel 10 Pro XL has a completely flat display covering. Google uses Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back of the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL.
In terms of design, the Pixel 10 Pro XL features flat sides with curved corners and a slight chamfer on the edges. It's significantly thicker and heavier than the Galaxy S26 Edge is rumored to be, though. The device measures 8.5mm thick and weighs 232 grams, meaning there could be a difference of three whole millimeters between the two handsets.
 



On the inside, the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge is rumored to be powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 platform — at least in some regions. There could be a Samsung Exynos variant available, too. This chip builds off the current Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, which already runs laps around the Tensor G5 processor in the Pixel 10 Pro XL.
While Google did make strides with the Tensor G5 mobile platform, it lags behind Apple and Qualcomm's best. Gaming performance is improved, but still not great. The one area where Tensor G5 shines is in on-device AI processing and optimization. Plenty of Google AI features run on-device thanks to the Tensor G5 silicon inside the Pixel 10 Pro XL. That's handy for speed and privacy.
Both phones will likely have the same 16GB of memory available, and will start at 256GB of base storage.

Samsung is rumored to bump the Galaxy S26 Edge's battery capacity up to 4,200mAh, but it'll still be about 1,000mAh behind the Pixel 10 Pro XL. Additionally, Google's flagship will charge faster, at 45W over a cable and 25W wirelessly using a Qi2.2 charger. The inbuilt Qi2 magnets help Pixel 10 Pro XL users power up quickly on the go.
Cameras are another way the Pixel 10 Pro XL makes use of its larger form factor. It includes a 50MP primary shooter, a 48MP ultrawide lens, and a 48MP telephoto camera with 5x optical zoom. On the front, you get a 42MP selfie cam to round out the experience. There are AI tools baked into Android 16 to enhance the photography experience, like Camera Coach.
Samsung's main camera on the Galaxy S26 Edge will be at least 200MP, but the secondary camera is unimpressive at only 12MP. The company isn't rumored to make major changes compared to the Galaxy S25 Edge, so don't expect a third rear camera anytime soon.
 



With uncertainty surrounding the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge, the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL looks more appealing than ever. It's a sure thing and doesn't try to reinvent the wheel. Buyers won't have to worry about short battery life or performance throttling — at least for the first 200 cycles. With Google software at the core and plenty of on-device AI, the Pixel 10 Pro XL will be one of the best Android phones on the market for years to come.
Unfortunately, those craving the thin-and-light phone lifestyle won't be satisfied by the Pixel 10 Pro XL. It's full of features, but that comes at a cost. It's one of the thickest and heaviest mainline flagships on the market. If the leaked Galaxy S26 Edge specs turn out to be accurate, it would be three millimeters thinner than the Pixel 10 Pro XL. If rumored weights hold, the Galaxy S26 Edge would be nearly 70 grams lighter than the Pixel 10 Pro XL.
No matter what your take is on thin phones, there is a major disparity between the rumored Galaxy S26 Edge and Pixel 10 Pro XL. The differences in size are major, and buyers will need to decide whether they're willing to wait and sacrifice features for that form factor.
 




Worth hoping for
The Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge might be worth hoping for, but not waiting for. Rumors can't decide whether Samsung will end up actually releasing another thin handset. Right now, you're better off grabbing the Galaxy S25 Edge or going for the Pixel 10 Pro XL instead.
 




A different alternative
The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL doesn't have much in common with the rumored Galaxy S26 Edge, but it is packed with features. If you're less concerned about thinness and weight, the Pixel 10 Pro XL is one of the best AI phones on the market.

On the heels of a 2025 season that saw large viewership increases -- including the most watched postseason in eight years and a World Series Game 7 that was the most watched Major League Baseball game in 34 years -- MLB announced Wednesday that it has formed new three-year media rights agreements with Netflix, NBCUniversal and ESPN.
As part of the rights agreements, which cover the 2026-2028 MLB seasons, the league’s longstanding relationship with ESPN will reach 39 consecutive seasons, NBC will return to regularly airing games on its broadcast network for the first time in a quarter century, and Netflix’s engagement with MLB will expand from documentaries to live baseball event coverage for the first time.
Sunday Night Baseball will shift from ESPN, where it aired since 1990, to NBCUniversal, which also secured the rights to Sunday Leadoff and the Wild Card Series in the postseason for NBC and Peacock.
Netflix will now air the T-Mobile Home Run Derby, an Opening Night exclusive and special event games set to include the 2026 MLB at Field of Dreams Game and the World Baseball Classic in Japan.
And ESPN will receive a national midweek game package throughout the season while also acquiring the rights to sell MLB.TV, the league’s out-of-market streaming service that set a record with 19.4 billion minutes watched in 2025.
“Our new media rights agreements with ESPN, NBCUniversal and Netflix provide us with a great opportunity to expand our reach to fans through three powerful destinations for live sports, entertainment, and marquee events,” said Commissioner Robert D. Manfred, Jr. “Following our last World Series game that averaged more than 51 million viewers globally, these partnerships build on MLB’s growing momentum that includes generational stars setting new standards for excellence, new rules which have improved the game on the field, and increases in important fan engagement metrics like viewership, attendance, participation and social media consumption.
“We’re looking forward to tapping into the unique areas of expertise that ESPN, NBCUniversal and Netflix each bring to the sport for the benefit of our fans.”

Several elements of MLB’s national broadcast rights will remain unchanged.
FOX/FS1 will continue to be the home of the All-Star Game and regular season games, as well as the World Series, League Championship Series and Division Series presented by Booking.com. TBS will continue to house LCS and Division Series telecasts, plus regular season games on Tuesday nights. Apple TV will continue to stream ""Friday Night Baseball"" doubleheaders throughout the regular season.
Here’s more on each of the three new media rights agreements:
Netflix
MLB and Netflix have previously collaborated on globally distributed documentaries, including the Emmy Award-winning “The Turnaround” and “The Comeback: 2004 Boston Red Sox,” both from 2024. There was also “The Clubhouse,” an eight-part docuseries that went behind the scenes with the 2024 Red Sox.
Now, as the streaming giant continues to branch out into more live sporting events, Netflix is bringing game action to its service, which has more than 90 million subscribers in the U.S. and Canada and over 300 million globally.
Netflix will open the MLB season the next three years with a single game on Opening Night, the evening prior to a full schedule of traditional Opening Day games. In 2026, the Opening Night game will pit Aaron Judge and the Yankees against Rafael Devers and the Giants on Wednesday, March 25.
The T-Mobile Home Run Derby, the most-watched skills competition in sports, will move from ESPN to Netflix in 2026. It will continue to take place the day prior to the All-Star Game, which in 2026 will be held at Philadelphia’s Citizens Bank Park.
Netflix will also stream an additional MLB special event game each year of the deal. In 2026, that will be the MLB at Field of Dreams game, live from Dyersville, Iowa, on Aug. 13. The return to the site of the iconic movie set will feature the Twins vs. the Phillies.
Those live events will all be produced by MLB Network’s Emmy Award-winning production team, in partnership with Netflix’s team.
And as previously announced in August, Netflix will also exclusively deliver, live and on-demand, all 47 games of the 2026 World Baseball Classic to its audience in Japan.
“We are incredibly thankful for our partnership with Major League Baseball,” said Bela Bajaria, Chief Content Officer, Netflix. “We started with critically-acclaimed documentaries, deepening the existing global passion for baseball. Now, we are seizing that moment by bringing massive cultural spectacles -- from Opening Night to the Home Run Derby -- directly to our members, reinforcing Netflix as the ultimate home for both the story and the sport.”

NBCUniversal
Way back on Aug. 26, 1939, Red Barber called a doubleheader between the Brooklyn Dodgers and Cincinnati Reds that aired on W2XBS – an experimental New York City TV station that would ultimately become NBC’s flagship station, WNBC. It was the first ever MLB television broadcast.
NBC and MLB went on to have broadcasting partnerships from 1947 to 1989 and from 1994 to 2000, with NBC broadcasting a number of World Series, All-Star Games and Games of the Week.
This new deal reunites the two institutions, with NBC taking over the Sunday Night Baseball broadcasts from ESPN. In 2025, ESPN’s Sunday Night Baseball game coverage recorded its best season since 2013, with an average viewing audience of 1.8 million viewers, a 21% increase over last year’s total.
The Sunday night game will air on Peacock (NBCUniversal’s streaming service) and NBCSN (NBC Sports’ new cable network) during weeks in which there is overlap with previously negotiated media rights deals on NBC.
NBC will also air the Wild Card Series and select special event games, including primetime matchups on Opening Day and Labor Day. In 2026, NBC’s first game will be a primetime Opening Day matchup between the Diamondbacks and two-time defending World Series champion Dodgers.
NBC will also have a presence during All-Star Week. The MLB Draft will move to the Saturday of All-Star Week where NBC and Peacock will present the first hour of the event. Peacock/NBCSN and MLB Network will carry the remainder of Day 1. NBC and Peacock also will present the Futures Game, a game featuring baseball’s future stars who are the top players in Minor League Baseball on All-Star Sunday. That game will be followed by a new event that will feature former players and celebrities which will be streamed on Peacock.
Peacock will regain rights to MLB’s Sunday Leadoff game, which it carried for the 2022-2023 seasons. Sunday Leadoff will be a package of 18 games that start prior to or around noon ET on Sundays. That will be followed by MLB Network-produced studio coverage of the full day of games, and then Sunday Night Baseball on NBC or Peacock.
The Peacock service will also regularly feature a game of the day, which will be available to fans outside the markets of the clubs competing.
“We are excited to welcome Major League Baseball back to the NBC Sports family as we showcase the best in the game with Sunday Night Baseball on NBC, NBCSN and Peacock, the first game of the day on most Sunday mornings exclusively on Peacock and NBCSN, and the full Wild Card round across NBC, NBCSN and Peacock,” said Rick Cordella, President, NBC Sports. “We can’t wait for the first pitch in primetime on March 26 … and what a way to start with the champion Los Angeles Dodgers’ opener following their thrilling World Series victory!”
ESPN
MLB and the “Worldwide Leader in Sports” have a partnership that dates back to 1990, and it will continue under this deal.
Fans will now be able to purchase MLB.TV through ESPN to watch their favorite teams outside their home territory. ESPN is incorporating a service to its streaming platform that saw a viewership increase of 34% in 2025.
During the term of the agreement, ESPN will be able to offer fans in-market games for the select MLB teams whose games are being produced and distributed by the league through the ESPN app. Fans will have the ability to purchase these subscriptions either independently, as part of a bundle with MLB.TV, or as part of a package with ESPN’s app. For the 2026 season, the local in-market streaming products will continue to be available through MLB’s platforms.
Note that MLB Network will continue to be available to fans purchasing an MLB.TV subscription and will remain available to fans through linear packages and a standalone direct-to-consumer offering.
Additionally, ESPN will have a national midweek game package throughout the season, available exclusively on its linear networks and the ESPN app.
“This fan-friendly, forward-thinking agreement allows us to showcase this great sport on a local and national level, while prioritizing our streaming future,” said Jimmy Pitaro, Chairman, ESPN. “MLB.TV is a coveted, must-have service for passionate MLB fans all over the country, and it will be strongly complemented by our national game package and in-market team rights.”
MLB saw double-digit viewership increases across its national partners in audiences in the 17-and-under and 18-34-year-old categories in 2025. That was part of viewership increases across all of the league’s national television partners, locally on regional sports networks, streaming on MLB.TV and in Japan."

Flagship smartphones keep getting more expensive but Amazon just threw down a record low price on the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra that makes the decision easier: This powerhouse with 512GB storage drops to $1,057 from its usual $1,419 price tagÂ and puts it in direct competition with Apple’s iPhone 17 Pro that launched in September.
Samsung loaded the S25 Ultra with arguments that might just make it the best smartphone of 2025. This Black Friday deal represents the lowest price we’ve seen on Samsung’s absolute best phone.

The Snapdragon 8 Elite processor inside the S25 Ultra represents a real leap in mobile computing power. Qualcomm built this chip on a 3nm process that gives faster speeds while using less power than previous generations. You get desktop-class performance in a phone that fits in your pocket with benchmark scores that embarrass Apple’s A18 Pro chip. The processing power handles intensive tasks like 4K video editing, complex photo processing, and demanding games without breaking a sweat.
The camera system of AI Night Mode takes low-light photography to a whole new level. Samsung’s AI algorithms analyze scenes in real-time and auto-optimize settings based on what you are shooting. The phone captures multiple exposures and combines them in an instant to churn out bright, clear photos in conditions where other phones would produce grainy messes. You can shoot in near-darkness and still get a usable photo with correct colors and sharp details. The AI recognizes different subjects like food, pets, landscapes, and people, then adjusts the processing to make each shot look its best without any manual tweaking.
With 512GB of storage, you finally have room to actually use your phone – not constantly manage it. Store thousands of photos, hundreds of video clips, and dozens of apps without the stress of running out of room. This storage tier is prohibitively expensive in iPhones, making Samsung’s pricing much more consumer-friendly. The fact that this is unlocked means you can switch carriers anytime without buying a new phone or dealing with carrier restrictions.
The built-in S Pen turns the S25 Ultra from just a great phone into a real productivity tool. You can take handwritten notes directly on the screen, annotate PDFs, sketch ideas, and have precision that your finger simply can’t match. The pen stores inside the body of the phone magnetically, so you never need to carry a separate stylus or have any fear of misplacing it. Samsung’s software converts handwriting into text instantly, making note-taking in meetings or during lectures infinitely more useful.
A 5000mAh battery keeps the phone running through full days of heavy use without needing a midday charge. You can stream video, browse social media, shoot photos, and make calls all day while still having juice left by bedtime. In addition, fast charging brings this phone’s battery from empty to 50% in about 30 minutes, saving you when you forget to charge it overnight. Wireless charging is also supported so you can simply drop your phone on a charging pad instead of fumbling with cables.
What’s more, it boasts a 6.8-inch display diagonal, with colors and blacks delivered by an Dynamic AMOLED panel. Scroll through apps and websites with incredibly smooth and responsive kinetic performance given the 120Hz refresh rate. Peak brightness is sufficient to keep the screen readable in direct sunlight, a problem that plagues cheaper phones. The screen will work with Samsung’s S Pen perfectly, with ultra-low latency making writing feel natural and immediate.
Flagship performance from this Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra with 512GB of storage can be had for $1,057 down from $1,419 and that undercuts Apple by a serious margin. The combination of cutting-edge specs and this record Black Friday price makes the S25 Ultra impossible to ignore if you’re in the market for a premium smartphone.

55,2025-11-19,"This summer, the PR agency Bospar was preparing a major announcement for its client, the AI computer vision company RealSense, when it discovered an awkward problem.
When Bospar asked ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or Copilot for information about RealSense, each one provided a version of the same answer: RealSense was no longer in business.
In reality, the company was on the verge of announcing a spin-out from its parent, Intel, and a $50 million funding round. How could RealSense get top-tier press coverage if the leading AI tools had already written its obituary?
""There's no 1-800 number for ChatGPT if there's an error,"" said Curtis Sparrer, principal at Bospar.
About half of US consumers are using AI-powered search to evaluate and discover brands, per a recent McKinsey report. In this new era, Google — which has introduced its own AI search features — still dominates the overall search market, responsible for roughly 90% of global search engine traffic, according to Cloudflare.
As the nature of search begins to shift, businesses from travel companies to clothing brands are racing to ensure they show up prominently — and accurately — inside these answer engines.
This story is part of a series exploring the changing online search landscape and its impact on consumers, media companies, advertisers, and tech platforms.
Stay tuned for:
The rise of GEO (generative engine optimization) has increased demand for established SEO (search engine optimization) players. On Wednesday, Adobe announced it intends to acquire the SEO — and now GEO — specialist marketing software platform Semrush, in a deal valued at $1.9 billion.
The trend has also spawned a cottage industry. Former experts on SEO are now declaring themselves gurus of GEO and AEO (answer engine optimization).
LinkedIn and Meta feeds are flooded with ads from startups, agencies, and consultants saying they have a formula to boost visibility on top AI platforms. There's a huge market for the taking: only around 16% of brands systematically track their AI search performance, according to McKinsey.
The search shifts have also sparked a fierce debate: Can GEO and AEO experts actually deliver on their promises?
""Everyone is going crazy about becoming the next agency — all the side hustlers and snake oil sellers with their tools already on the train and riding the hype,"" said Kai Spriestersbach, an applied AI researcher, web scientist, and SEO veteran.
Business Insider spoke with SEO experts and three of the top AI search platforms — Google, Microsoft, and Perplexity — to investigate what content optimization looks like in the age of AI. OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment.
The takeaway: Some GEO techniques can help brands boost their visibility in AI-generated answers, but these gains may be fleeting in a fast-changing space where models are constantly retrained and updated. In some ways, GEO is a new label for companies' existing brand-building strategies, which involve a mix of maintaining good website hygiene, a solid PR strategy, and traditional paid advertising to help boost consumer awareness.
Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today.
One AI visibility tracking tool, Lorelight, recently shut down, with its founder saying that there was no such thing as a ""GEO strategy"" separate from brand building, at least for large companies.
""There's going to be a lot of people who benefit from implying that they're very good at GEO. And then there's going to be a lot of tech companies, specifically AI companies, who benefit from saying that it's all hogwash,"" said Jesse Dwyer, head of communications at Perplexity. ""The reality is always somewhere in between.""
SEO, which is largely focused on Google search, refers to the practice of designing web pages and securing links from quality sites to help your brand rank highly on search engine results pages.
The SEO industry is built on more than 25 years of study, experimentation, and some disclosures from the search giants themselves about how the ranking algorithms work. But there are key differences between GEO and SEO.
For starters, the GEO world has far less historical data to build its assumptions on. For traditional search, practitioners can draw on tools like the Google Search Console to see how their sites appear in search results and Google Trends to identify trending terms. AI platforms keep this sort of data much closer to the vest, beyond the occasional blog post, such as a recent study from OpenAI that found people were largely using ChatGPT for everyday tasks, including help with writing and tech support.
""You don't know how people are looking for brands and services right now,"" within AI chats, Spriestersbach said.
There's also the personalization factor. The front page of traditional search generally looks the same for everyone, though Google offers options to tailor results. Now, companies must try to make their brands shine in unique and deeper conversational searches. Answers can vary wildly for different users based on how they've configured their preferences and their chat histories.
Further complicating things: Platforms are regularly retraining their models, which can dramatically change how a brand shows up from one day to the next, said Tim de Rosen, cofounder of GEO auditing firm AIVO Standard.
While many GEO companies offer services like dashboards that analyze a subset of user prompts, most of what's being measured isn't reproducible. The different ways users ask questions and how models respond — plus the data they're drawing from — are all in a constant state of flux, de Rosen said, which makes results ""inherently unstable.""
Major platforms say the key principles of SEO still apply in the age of AI. Similar to SEO, AI systems rely on fresh, highly ranked, and trustworthy content, said Krishna Madhavan, principal product manager for Microsoft Bing.
""Be skeptical of shortcuts,"" he said.
Danny Sullivan, director at Google Search, said any GEO tools that advise designing content solely for rank and visibility purposes lose ""track of the big picture.""
""Are you doing things that are useful for human beings?"" he said. ""That's what we want to reward.""
Sullivan shared an example of popular advice from SEO/GEO experts that could soon go stale: that large language models favor bite-sized content.
""Maybe they've seen that this seems to work in some edge cases in some places,"" but the model will inevitably change, he said. ""All that work you did to please the system may not carry through to the long term.""
What is new, Madhavan of Bing said, is that companies must think about optimizing for inclusion in a synthesized answer, rather than simply a list of links on a search results page.
""Think beyond keywords to user intent, question‑answer structure, and machine‑readable cues that make your content easy to parse,"" Madhavan said.
As the GEO industry takes shape, companies are proceeding with caution and seeking guidance from multiple practitioners.
Vineet Mehra, CMO of fintech company Chime, said marketers often make the mistake of working with one tool or agency.
""We try to use multiple companies to create a little bit of competition,"" he said. ""You see who's going to customize their product road map for you, who is innovating faster than the other.""
The PR agency Bospar also determined that bringing together a patchwork of solutions was better than relying on a single consultant or GEO platform. They ultimately traced RealSense's premature ""death"" to a 2021 news article that had misrepresented a restructuring, which then snowballed when it was discussed on platforms like Reddit — an important source of content for training large language models.
Bospar sought a correction from the original publication and made changes on RealSense's website, including an FAQ section addressing the closure rumor. The agency also encouraged RealSense executives to actively participate in trending robotics and AI conversations on social media to demonstrate their thought leadership.
While AI visibility tools like dashboards are in their infancy, Bospar's tactics should be familiar to anyone handling a company's reputation in the digital era.
""It's pretty early days in GEO and AEO for anyone to raise their hands and declare themselves as an expert,"" Bospar's Sparrer said. ""I think that's a little rich at this point considering how new the science is.""
Google:
Sullivan said the core principles of SEO generally apply to new forms of AI search.
""Plenty of sites succeed because they don't do SEO, or hire SEOs,"" Sullivan said. ""They don't think about it because they're just focused on making great content.""
General website and structured data hygiene always make sense, ensuring Google's search crawlers can actually get to the relevant content, Sullivan said, especially as AI answers still have a lot of traditional search results at their core.
AI formats are also getting better at multi-modal queries — a user might ask ""what's in this video?"" for example.
""If you've still been a text-only kind of player, more images and videos may help you. But they would have helped you anyway,"" Sullivan said.
Microsoft:
Madhavan said the fundamentals of SEO are still critical, including structure and freshness signals that make content easier for AI to consume. This includes using Q&A sections, sitemaps, and schema, a code that helps search engines understand your site, as well as adopting IndexNow, a protocol that lets search engines know when your site changes.
Stylistically, Krishna also suggests lists and tables instead of long walls of text, and advises keeping punctuation simple, including avoiding em dashes and symbols.
Perplexity:
With the shift from SEO to GEO, ""the biggest mistake you can make is to just try and transfer your understanding apples to apples,"" Dwyer said — and a lot of the companies offering GEO services are doing just that.
Dwyer said he's also been advising marketers that AI search will shift budgets toward old-fashioned brand marketing. AI removes the ""friction"" of search and lets people buy things just by asking for them. As a result, building a strong brand will become increasingly important, he said.

61,2025-11-19,"As dementia rates continue to rise worldwide, we're all looking for ways to preserve and maintain our brain health as we age.
And according to research presented at an annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition in Boston, there's one simple dietary swap that could reduce your risk of dying from dementia—here's what they found.
For this study, researchers wanted to dig into the connection between olive oil consumption and dementia rates, namely looking at how olive oil consumption impacted participants' likelihood of dying from dementia.
The research had a large sample size of 90,000 medical professionals who were part of two long-term studies on health and lifestyle factors. The studies spanned nearly 30 years, with the average participant being 56 years old when they began in 1990.
Over the next 28 years, the data showed that nearly 5,000 of those participants died from dementia. However, the study authors observed that risk was 28% lower for participants who regularly consumed olive oil (more specifically, they were consuming over half a tablespoon per day) compared to those who rarely used it.
Interestingly, this finding was independent of overall dietary choices, suggesting that a simple swap of olive oil when you might use margarine or mayonnaise could have brain-healthy benefits, regardless of the rest of your diet.
And while this research only shows a link, as opposed to offering an explanation for why, the researchers concluded that replacing just one daily teaspoon of margarine or mayonnaise with olive oil could lower the risk of dying from dementia by 8 to 14%.
It's worth mentioning, as well, that this isn't the first time research has suggested olive oil has brain benefits. One 2022 study1 published in Nutrients found that people with mild cognitive impairment who were supplemented with 30 mL of extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) per day for six months experienced significant improvements in behavioral and clinical dementia rating (CDR) scores.
The researchers from that study also discovered that the EVOO helped enhance the function of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), while the breakdown and dysfunction of the BBB are associated with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease.
Other studies2 also suggest olive oil consumption might reduce the accumulation of amyloid plaques3, which are also involved in the onset and progression of Alzheimer's.

While this study is an example of correlation and not causation and still needs to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, the findings offer yet another instance of the benefits of olive oil.
We know olive oil can help with inflammation4, lower blood pressure5, and has been a staple in the Mediterranean diet for years, which is also associated with brain health and longevity.
So if you regularly use mayonnaise or vegetable oils in your cooking, or even salad dressings, swapping it out for 1 teaspoon of olive oil is a simple brain-boosting solution.
Curious about which options are best? Here are our 12 favorite olive oils to help you choose.
Another way to support your brain health is with research-backed nutrients, botanicals, and bioactives. The research is particularly strong for neuronutrient citicoline, as well as phytonutrients like resveratrol. Don't know where to start? Don't fret —we've consulted a nutrition scientist to compile a list of memory-supporting supplements featuring these ingredients.

Investors losing sleep over Nvidia’s earnings can resume breathing normally. All the news from CEO Jensen Huang was reassuring for stakeholders in the world’s largest publicly traded company.
“There’s been a lot of talk about an AI bubble. From our vantage point, we see something very different,” Huang said on the company’s investor call.
That “something very different” seems to be tons and tons of money pouring in. The company posted a record $57.01 billion in revenue during its fiscal third quarter. That was well above market expectations of $54.92 billion, as reported by CNBC. Earnings per share also beat expectations at $1.30 versus $1.25.
Nvidia’s bread and butter, the data center business, also brought in record revenue at $51.2 billion, which was up 66% from this time last year.
The tech giant is expecting that record demand to continue, as Huang said in the earnings press release that âBlackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out.” Revenue expectations for the upcoming quarter were $65 billion, above market expectations of $61.66 billion.
“We currently have visibility to a half a trillion dollars in Blackwell and Rubin [chips] revenue from the start of this year through the end of calendar year 2026,” Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said in the company’s investor call on Wednesday.
The AI industry had been biting its nails in anticipation of this specific report for some time now.
As Nvidia was busy hitting records over the quarter as the first company to ever hit $5 trillion market cap, worries over an AI bubble ballooned steadily. At the heart of every concern was Nvidia, which is considered central to the AI trade as the biggest global supplier of chips.
A growing chorus of experts, from famous investors to economists, central banks and even top tech CEOs themselves, have raised concerns about an overvaluation of AI stocks in recent months.
Then, on top of all that, two major investors, Japan’s SoftBank and Peter Thiel’s hedge fund Thiel Macro, offloaded their entire stake in the company back-to-back over the past two weeks.
Investors were looking to Wednesday’s report to see if Nvidia could back up its meteoric valuations and quell those worries of an impending bubble burst. The shares rose more than 5% in response to the report, so it seems they might be satisfied so far with what they have seen.
Nvidia has had a whirlwind quarter. The tech giant announced a flurry of high profile partnerships, including its first ever with OpenAI competitor Anthropic.
The partnerships added fuel to the AI bubble fire, as experts opined that this infinitely expanding and tangled web of multibillion dollar investments made amongst a handful of giant tech companies with overlapping interests was “circular dealmaking.”
The SEC filing had potentially interesting revelations about one of these partnerships. Though the company characterizes its commitment to invest up to $10 billion in Anthropic as a clear “agreement,” the tech giant’s whopping $100 billion investment into OpenAI is characterized as “a letter of intent with an opportunity to invest.” The first to point that out was journalist Ed Zitron on X. Nvidia hasn’t yet responded to a Gizmodo request for comment.
Also this past quarter, the company hosted its first GPU Technology Conference in Washington D.C. as CEO Jensen Huang continued cozying up to the Trump administration in hopes of a desirable resolution to the on-again-off-again China chips sales ban saga.
“Sizable purchase orders never materialized” this past quarter due to that political uncertainty, Kress said.
“While we were disappointed in the current state that prevents us from shipping more competitive data center compute products to China, we are committed to continued engagement with the U.S. and China governments,” she added.
But Huang’s efforts may be bearing some fruit. Axios reported earlier on Wednesday that White House officials were asking lawmakers to dump the GAIN AI Act that would heavily restrict Nvidia’s ability to sell chips to China if it passes as part of the upcoming annual defense bill.

63,2025-11-19,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on Wednesday warned the public against dealing with unregistered online bond platform providers (OBPP) as they lack supervisory oversight.
Online Bond Platform Providers (OBPP) facilitate the buying, selling, and management of fixed income investment products such as bonds for retail and institutional investors. At present, there are 28 OBPPs registered with the NSE and 33 with the BSE. The regulator said that certain entities, including fintech companies and stock brokers, are offering services in the nature of OBPPs without obtaining due registration from the stock exchanges.
“Such unregistered platforms lack regulatory or supervisory oversight and do not provide for any mechanisms for investor protection or grievance redressal,” Sebi warned.
The activities undertaken by such unregistered online platforms may potentially be in violation of the Companies Act and the SEBI Act, 1992.  The markets regulator urged investors to exercise caution and avoid transacting on unregistered online bond platforms. They should verify the registration status of the OBPPs prior to transacting, and deal only with Sebi-registered entities, in order to safeguard their interests, it said.
It also cautioned market participants to ensure compliance with the applicable regulatory framework prior to offering any services in the nature of OBPP.

69,2025-11-19,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran Monday raised concerns that initial public offerings (IPO) are increasingly being used as exit routes for early-stage investors rather than an instrument for raising long-term capital.
Fuelled by abundant liquidity, aggressive retail participation and a rush of new-age companies seeking capital, the Indian primary market has been booming over the last two years.
Behind the glitter of listing-day and oversubscription headlines lie a deeper question that worries serious investors: are IPOs becoming systematically overpriced? And, are promoters and early investors using IPOs as an exit route to cash out their holdings while the public enters these stocks at inflated prices?
A closer look at recent IPO trends suggests the answer could be tilting increasingly towards a “yes”. That’s at a time when 84 companies have received the green signal from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to raise Rs 1.07 lakh crore and another 118 crore companies have approached it for approval to raise Rs 1.76 lakh crore, according to data from primedatabase.com.
An IPO is typically supposed to be a mechanism for companies to raise fresh capital for expansion, innovation and long-term growth. Most Indian IPOs over the last three months were structured as offers for sale, essentially designed less as fundraising vehicles for future investments and more as monetisation opportunities for promoters and pre-IPO investors — private equity funds, early angels, strategic investors and sometimes even founders.
For example, Korean firm LG’s entire IPO of Rs 11,000 crore went to the Korean promoter. In the case of the Tata Capital IPO, over Rs 8,600 crore went to the promoter Tata Sons and other investors, and in the Lenskart IPO, over Rs 5,000 crore was an offer for sale by promoters and other early shareholders. The entire Rs 3,000 crore issue of WeWork India was OFS by existing shareholders.
The structure of many issues tells the story. A large portion of the issue size in several IPOs has recently consisted of Offer for Sale (OFS), a transaction in which existing shareholders sell their shares to the public. OFS proceeds do not go to the company. They go directly into the pockets of those selling shares – promoters and other pre-IPO shareholders. This is not problematic or scam by itself as early investors deserve decent exits. But when OFS dominates the issue and valuations look stretched, it raises serious red flags.
According to Ponmudi R, CEO, Enrich Money, overpriced IPOs are emerging as a new warning signal in India’s primary market. “The growing rush to chase lofty valuations — often driven by hype, aggressive anchor participation, and overly optimistic growth assumptions — is blurring the line between confidence and complacency. When market prices drift too far from earnings reality, it’s retail investors who bear the brunt, undermining the very trust and participation that sustain the market’s long-term vitality,” Ponmudi said.
Companies with limited profitability, modest track records or uncertain future cash flows have been demanding valuations that even established, well-managed listed companies do not command. This “valuation leap” is often justified through glossy pitch decks, future projections and narratives of disruption. In many cases, the companies adopt aggressive accounting approaches to paint a picture of accelerated growth and expanding margins right before going public.
The promoters and early shareholders, who acquired shares years earlier at vastly lower valuations, get a golden opportunity. “The biggest worry that I have at this point of time — the investor is taking all the risk. Who is the seller? The seller is private equity. Private equity knows everything about the company. They know whether that stock is overvalued at 40 times or 50 times. The promoter is selling. The promoter knows whether the stock is overvalued or undervalued,” a top fund manager said at the sidelines of the Morningstar investor conference recently.
Analysts said the biggest concern is asymmetry of information and incentives. Promoters and private equity funds know far more about the company’s internal weaknesses, risks and realistic growth potential than the public markets ever will. When they choose to sell a large portion of shares in the IPO, especially at high valuations, it raises a fundamental question: If the future’s so bright, why are those closest to the company cashing out aggressively? Investors even begin to wonder if the IPO proceeds were really needed, or if the goal was simply to take advantage of hot market sentiment.
However, some experts believe that promoters and private equity funds using IPOs to exit is actually a sign of a maturing market.
According to Pranav Haldea, MD, Prime Database, there have been several instances in the past wherein a big hue and cry was made about expensive valuations at the time of IPO. Several of these have gone to become multibaggers. “Even the much-maligned new age technology companies have, on an average, delivered an approximate return of 50 per cent since their listing. Somehow, we have this unfair expectation of all IPOs to not just list with a pop but to also continue to trade in the positive until perpetuity,” he said.
“We need to recognise that initial investors have taken significant risks by investing their money. They will need an exit, return money to their investors, and only then will they be able to raise the next round of funding to invest in the next set of companies,” Haldea said. “This is akin to what you see in the western markets and is a sign of maturing of the Indian capital market ecosystem. We should not grudge them for making money. For every multibagger, it is also important to remember that there would be 10 duds where they would have invested,” Haldea said.
That said, retail investors often fall victim to this environment of IPO hype. They tend to view IPOs as guaranteed opportunities for quick gains, but when the euphoria subsides, valuations recalibrate and the stock begins trading on fundamentals. Several high-profile IPOs in recent years have delivered negative or stagnant returns after the first few months, despite blockbuster listings. The public ends up holding expensive shares, while insiders walk away with massive profits.
This does not mean every IPO is overpriced or unfair. Many high-quality companies have used the public markets responsibly. But the trend of excessive valuations, heavy OFS components and aggressive marketing strategies has become common enough to warrant caution.
Ponmudi said India’s growth story remains robust, but valuation discipline must evolve alongside it. Greater transparency around forward P/E multiples, peer benchmarks, and profitability outlooks is essential to ensure informed investing. “The market must prioritize sustainable business models over speculative pricing — because if short-term greed takes precedence, It risks eroding the long-term growth cycle that India’s markets have painstakingly built on credibility and investor trust,” he said.
Regulators have tried tightening disclosure norms, especially around related-party transactions, financial projections and utilisation of funds. But pricing remains largely a market-driven mechanism. When liquidity is abundant and retail enthusiasm high, investment bankers and promoters naturally push for the highest possible valuations. This imbalance of power leaves small investors disproportionately vulnerable.
The IPO market is at a crossroads. “If companies treat IPOs primarily as exit routes rather than long-term partnerships with public shareholders, trust will erode. If retail investors repeatedly face post-listing disappointments, participation will shrink. And if valuations continue to stretch beyond fundamentals, the market risks a painful correction,” said a fund manager.
For the IPO ecosystem to remain healthy, companies must price issues more reasonably, investors must evaluate fundamentals rather than narratives, and regulators must continue tightening oversight of disclosures. Until then, one thing is clear: in too many Indian IPOs today, promoters mint money while the public is left holding overpriced shares. The bottom line: the money doesn’t go into capacity expansion or new projects.

Satya Nadella isn't a fan of letting memes define Microsoft.
The Microsoft CEO discussed the impact of a 2011 cartoon that depicted tension between the company's various divisions during a Tuesday episode of Stripe's ""Cheeky Pint"" podcast.
""That cartoon is a great example of someone else defining what became the cultural narrative more so than reality,"" Nadella told Stripe cofounder John Collison.
The drawing was part of a larger set of drawings by cartoonist Manu Cornet that poked fun at the Big Tech org charts. For Microsoft's chart, three separate divisions were illustrated aiming guns at each other.
""I'd say there are two things that I learned from that entire episode because I always say, look, I'm a consummate insider, right? Anything good and bad about Microsoft of the last 35 years, I lived through them all, and I'm part of it, right?"" Nadella said. ""So I can't deny any of it. The thing that I felt was, a little bit of that was just we lost our own belief because we lost the narrative.""
""So this doesn't mean, oh, wow, we were all perfect divisions and we were all sort of, you know, in greater harmony. That is not the case,"" Nadella added. ""But you know, in some sense, some of these divisional tensions are real issues that need to have tension, right?""
Nadella also suggested that there can be a time and a place for rivalry within a large organization.
""Social cohesion is not a goal. Winning in the marketplace is a goal,"" Nadella said on the podcast. ""But at some level, you have to orchestrate these large organizations — in fact, you might even have two competing teams, by design.""
However, the cartoon is an example of how external voices, like memes, can shape how employees internally view their workplace culture, the CEO said. That's when executives and managers have to ensure they've built enough trust with workers to withstand the influence of social media.
""How to communicate in today's world where your employees read about you outside and form opinions about you is one of the toughest leadership challenges,"" Nadella said.
It's not the first time Nadella has addressed the over-decade-old cartoon. In his 2017 book, ""Hit Refresh,"" he wrote that he was upset that Microsoft's own people ""just accepted it.""
""As a twenty-four-year veteran of Microsoft, a consummate insider, the caricature really bothered me,"" Nadella wrote.
The cartoon came out years before he took over as CEO in 2014, but turning around the company's culture was Nadella's ""highest priority"" when he took the helm, he said in the book. He said he'd do so by removing barriers to innovation and creating a narrative from the top that shapes individual teams.
His shift to a ""growth mindset"" and ""learn-it-all versus know-it-all"" culture appears to be working more than a decade into his tenure. Nadella has grown Microsoft from a roughly $300 billion company to the second to reach a $4 trillion market cap, a milestone it crossed in October. The CEO has also positioned the company well in the AI arms race, investing early in OpenAI.
Still, external voices can be loud at times.
""I would say the challenge for all of us in today's world is, let the social media memes not define us,"" Nadella told Collison. ""What's that inner strength that is there in an organization that can, in fact, resist the social meme — that I think is the key.""

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sophia Sun, 29, from San Francisco. The following has been edited for length and clarity.
My first job out of college was at Microsoft, where I worked as a program manager and product manager from 2018 to 2023.
In January 2023, I left my Big Tech job to work for a creator commerce platform. There, I developed an AI product, which led to me landing a senior AI role at Microsoft in July 2024.
In the current job market, AI feels like the safest domain to be an expert in.
My playbook for breaking into AI is to find a real user problem, design a lightweight AI solution, and turn it into proof of work. 
After joining Microsoft in 2018, I worked on the team of an augmented reality headset device, Microsoft HoloLens, for 2.5 years. Then I moved to an edtech team for a further two years.
Around the time I started at Microsoft, I created my own podcast. I wanted to help creators like myself build their businesses, so I started interviewing for jobs with creator economy firms. In January 2023, I left Microsoft to join Kajabi, a company that developed a business platform for creators and entrepreneurs, as a senior product manager.
At the time, I wanted to build a content repurposing tool to help creators increase their reach. Many creators lack marketing experience, and I imagined the tool would use AI to generate content, for example by taking the transcript from a podcast episode and condensing it into a blog. I thought it could also chop up a creator's hourlong video into short-form videos for TikTok and Instagram.
Before pitching the idea for the tool, I waited around a month after joining the company to understand its priorities. I got the green light and started working on the project around April 2023 with engineers and marketing teammates at Kajabi.
I hadn't built an AI product myself before, though I was familiar with AI-powered technologies.
I struggled to find resources online explaining how to launch AI products, so I read blogs about things like product pricing that weren't focused on AI products, and then talked to my manager about how we could tweak that guidance to be relevant to us.
Engineering different prompts was key to the project, for example, to generate a good blog post versus a good LinkedIn post. I worked with my engineering team to build an internal tool that easily tested prompts for the main tool and compared them simultaneously.
It was helpful to build infrastructure that could help us iterate and experiment quickly. If your company doesn't have internal tools for testing, I'd suggest building them.
I had around 200 of my own podcast episodes that I could use as testing material by running them through the tool and seeing what marketing materials it made. If I were generating a blog post and the tool didn't quite capture the most important parts of the episode, I would tweak the prompt to improve the output.
We launched the product, called Creator Studio, in March 2024. I loved working at Kajabi, but I wanted to work on a team where people had more experience with AI.
Shortly after the launch, I saw Microsoft was hiring for a team developing generative AI to make visual content, like posters and infographics.
I was excited about the role because I felt that, while there's a lot of industry-wide emphasis on using AI for text generation, we still haven't figured out how to use AI for images and video that well. By joining a visuals team, I thought I would learn skills that others would have to catch up to later, helping me future-proof my career.
I practice a lot for my interviews. No matter how experienced you are, you have to practice telling your story in a way that makes sense to an audience meeting you for the first time.
I rejoined Microsoft in July 2024 as a senior AI product manager. I think the fact that I could talk about my end-to-end experience building an AI product at Kajabi helped me land the role. I could show I identified a business problem and explored solutions, and I had a thorough story about what worked and what I learned when things failed.
Having awesome grades is one thing, but if you've built an actual AI project, it demonstrates your abilities.
Developing a sense of what makes a good AI product is something you can do every day. Test out whether an AI agent can solve a real problem for you, like booking your flights.
If your company isn't really working on AI, you can pitch a project, like I did.

73,2025-11-19,"Starlink is exploding at a rapid rate, both in popularity and in terms of overall growth. In fact, SpaceX's satellite internet service surpassed two million U.S. subscribers in 2025. That makes a worldwide total of more than 6 million users, up from 4.6 million in 2024. But Starlink's rise has had a major impact on HughesNet, which has been one of the best and only Starlink alternatives out there.
The issue is that Starlink, which users believe is reliable, is taking over in rural areas where Hughesnet once thrived. Customers in those regions benefit from a fast, low-orbit satellite network, which is exactly what Starlink provides. The more customers Starlink takes from those areas, the more HughesNet's current and potential customers will likely begin to jump ship. In the end, HughesNet hasn't found a way to keep up with the loss of subscribers or to otherwise prevent users from moving to Starlink.
However, instead of attempting to fight back, HughesNet's parent company, EchoStar, has made a deal with SpaceX. That deal consists of a referral program that HughesNet can offer to its existing customers, which will direct them to Starlink for internet service. This deal, while encouraging users to leave, does allow Hughesnet to keep some revenue in the process. But this may not be enough to save Hughesnet in the long run. According to Space Intel, Hughesnet may file for bankruptcy and be forced to eventually step back from the broadband internet consumer market.
HughesNet's business has been steadily declining, with the company reporting year-over-year quarterly losses in 2023. EchoStar attributed those losses not only to competitors' efforts, but also to restrictions in its current satellite network. As a result, HughesNet, which isn't considered the best home internet provider in terms of customer satisfaction, began moving more toward enterprise-level customers. It's a direction the company has been increasingly prioritizing.
In an effort to address some of these problems, HughesNet made a move to invest in its infrastructure in 2023 with the Jupiter 3 satellite. The satellite was designed to improve internet download speeds, and when it was launched, it seemed to be just what the company needed. But HughesNet's issues are also linked to the actual positioning of its satellites, which doesn't facilitate a positive real-time internet experience. The fact that HughesNet doesn't have as many satellites as other providers also doesn't help matters.
Satellite positioning is also to blame for HughesNet's struggles during bad weather. Heavy rain or thunderstorms can interrupt the signal, which affects usability. Monthly data allowances have been a problem too, because once subscribers pass those limits, internet service inevitably slows down. However, the company hasn't introduced an unlimited data option that solves the problem to this point. Despite any work to improve its user experience, HughesNet has fallen so far behind that it may be impossible to catch up."

75,2025-11-19,"Interior designer Matthew Williamson has created an amber-toned trophy for the 2026 BRIT Awards, which was designed to mark the ceremony being hosted in Manchester for the first time.
Williamson, who is a judge for this year's Dezeen Awards, wanted the statuettes to be connected to Manchester, which is his home town and is hosting the awards ceremony for the first time time year.
He took inspiration for the statuettes from the city of Manchester's logo, which features a worker bee.
""Whilst colour and pattern may have been a more predictable route for me, I wanted to pause, take stock and offer something truly personal to me,"" Williamson said.
""Above all, I wanted to ensure it connected to Manchester, the BRITs' new location and my hometown.""
""Cast in a chic amber-toned resin, the statue resembles the golden honey of a worker bee, Manchester's logo symbolising the city's role during the industrial revolution and so much more.""
Williamson placed the statuette on top of a globe – a motif that also features in the city of Manchester logo.
""The BRITs also represent the global reach of British music and so I designed the statue to sit on top of a globe,"" explained Williamson.
""I imagine each deserving winner will feel on top of the world as they receive their award and I cannot wait to see the trophy I designed being part of the celebrations on the night.""
The BRIT Awards are the British Phonographic Industry's music awards and were first held in 1977. Next year, the ceremony will take place in Manchester at the Populous-designed Co-op Live arena. It marks the first time the presentation has taken place outside London.
Since 1992, the organisation has chosen a different designer to create a unique statuette for the awards each year. Previously, the award trophies have been designed by artist Anish Kapoor, architect Zaha Hadid and designers Es Devlin and Yinka llori.

Dear Prudence is Slate’s advice column. Submit questions here. (It’s anonymous!)
Dear Prudence,
My sister, “Sally,” and I have always been close, which means I’ve had a front row seat to her formerly chaotic dating life. There was an era all of Sally’s friends called “the soap opera year” because her romantic life was unbelievable. I was so happy when she finally got into a stable, loving relationship, although I was surprised that it wasn’t a monogamous one. It’s a relationship between two guys who are also with each other. It’s unusual, but they’ve all seemed very happy for five years. Everyone treats each other with love and thoughtfulness. Last year, they bought a house, and this summer, they’re planning legal documents and a traditional but symbolic marriage ceremony. Our extended family was slightly chilly in the first year they were together, but everyone has warmed up, or so I thought.
My husband never gelled with Sally or her fiancés, but they’ve always been friendly. But when she asked if our girls (5 and 7) could be flower girls in her wedding, he instantly said no. They were at his cousin’s wedding this past summer and loved it. When I tried to talk to him about it, he said the relationship was going to fall apart, and he didn’t want our kids to be part of that. But plenty of marriages end in divorce, and we don’t skip weddings for that reason. Also, I think this one is pretty stable! When I pushed back, he claimed it’s because it’s not a real wedding and it will just confuse them. How do I talk to him about whatever’s going on here? It feels like he’s judging Sally and her fiancés for no reason. These people are my family, and I love and support them. They’re in a serious and committed relationship and planning a very PG event. My church-going grandma will be there! I don’t know how to talk to my husband about this.
—Sister of the Bride
Dear Sister of the Bride,
Who says no to their kid being a flower girl?? Come on! Your husband really wants to pass on a sweet memory and adorable pictures because this marriage, like all marriages, might fall apart?
I have several theories about his stance on this, and they all involve words ranging from “hater” and “homophobic” to “judgmental” and “jealous.” But you didn’t ask me to rate how terrible he is being (on a scale of one to 10, at least a seven) or whether I think he’s a bad spouse (there’s no way this jerk move is an isolated moment). You asked me how to talk to him about this. That obviously won’t include telling him that you think he’s being an irrational jerk.
So, instead, really try to get him to open up. Your goal should be to make him feel heard and ease any anxiety he might be experiencing about his little kids being roped into a situation that feels overwhelming, confusing, and unfamiliar to him. A good opening question might be something like, “We talked about it briefly, but I want to hear more about how you feel about Sally’s ceremony and  your concern for the girls.” You might even add, “I’ve thought about what you said about the girls being confused.  Do you think they might be having some kind of emotional struggle that makes it hard for them to deal with new experiences, and if it is something we should be cautious of in general?” Or, “Have Sally or her partners done or said anything inappropriate or not child-friendly?” We know the answers to these questions are no.
But my hope is that if he believes you’re taking his position really seriously, he’ll be a bit disarmed—and also be confronted with how difficult it is to explain his stance. The goal is to inspire him to go, “No no no, it’s not even that big of a deal. They can be the flower girls, I just don’t think we should tell them it’s a ‘symbolic’ wedding,” or “I’m actually fine with it, it’s just that I don’t know how to explain Sally’s relationship to my mom so let’s leave out some of the details when we talk to her.”
My final suggestion only works if caring for the kids alone would stress him out—and it’s kind of risky because if he agrees to it, you will not be happy. But you could just say, “I thought about what you said, and maybe the girls shouldn’t go to the wedding at all if we don’t want them to be confused. I’ll just attend on my own, and they can stay back with you.” Hopefully, he replies, “No, it’s not that serious! They can go!” Then you can take that opportunity to point out that throwing rose petals isn’t going to do anything to change their understanding of the institution of marriage.
Regardless of whether your daughters end up being on flower girl duty, it wouldn’t be the worst idea to give your husband a pass and let him make an excuse and stay home. I know that if I were Sally, I wouldn’t want someone with such negative thoughts about my marriage to be there, giving off bad vibes on my special day.

Dear Prudence,
Right now, I am raising two of my grandnieces, ages 10 and 12. I am on a fixed income, and even with the government benefits, I depend on extended help. I am at the end of my rope with the oldest, “Zoe.”
She would lose her head if it weren’t screwed on, as my mother would say. Zoe will lose not only school supplies but also very expensive items like water bottles, dance shoes, and winter coats. A relative gave both girls very nice water bottles as a gift. They are usually around $40 and are considered a trendy item. Zoe lost hers in a week and threw a fit that it wasn’t magically replaced, and claimed that it wasn’t fair that her sister still had hers. We tried reminders, lists, and are on the waiting list to get Zoe tested.
I can’t deal. Zoe seems unable to understand the value of her stuff with regard to how much I’ve spent, just the value to her peers. So I get a lot of flea market and thrift store finds because Zoe needs to be clothed and not freezing to death! Zoe hates it and picks fights with her sister over being the “favorite.” Her 10-year-old sister isn’t getting anything Zoe hasn’t; she just remembers to take care of her things.
The girls are doing well enough in school. My nearest relative is my second cousin, and she has a family of her own. They are available in an emergency or if I need a ride into the city, but I am struggling here. Frankly, I don’t think Zoe will suffer if she has to wear unfashionable coats or clothes if they are clean and fit her. I am just trying my best. Help!
—Aunt in Idaho
Dear Aunt in Idaho,
Your life is not easy right now, and I understand why you would have such a strong reaction to Zoe losing valuable items while you’re so stressed about how to afford the basics for her and her sister. I don’t know if her being scatterbrained is just her personality or a reaction to whatever trauma led to her separation from her parents, or an undiagnosed issue like ADHD (which I’m glad you’re looking into). Whatever the source, I think you can agree that this kid has been through a lot, and the least stigmatizing or humiliating solution to her tendency to lose her belongings will be the best way forward.
So keep getting her the same stuff you get her sister. Within your budget, of course. What she has should reflect what you can afford (and there’s absolutely no problem with flea market and thrift store finds), not your frustration with her past mistakes. If she loses an expensive water bottle and gets a super cheap one as a replacement, that’s fair. Just make sure you explain it in a neutral way with a focus on your budget, not on her character and your frustration with her. And while it’s impossible to know what will delight or horrify a tween, there’s a way to spin hunting for treasures at a second-hand store that might actually be kind of fun. Plus, who knows, maybe she’ll do a better job of holding onto things she found herself.
I’m troubled by Zoe’s sense that her sister is the favorite. I can’t imagine how hard it must be to be without her parents and to feel a sense of rejection on top of that. Even if her belief is baseless, the effect is the same. I know you’re stretched thin and don’t have a lot of extra time or energy, but please go out of your way to show her some extra love and attention and let her know that you are just as concerned about her happiness as you are about her belongings.

Dear Prudence,
My son and his wife just had what may be their first child. I say “may” because the baby has red hair, and neither my son nor my daughter-in-law nor anyone else in the family is a redhead. I’m convinced that she slept with another man. How do I persuade him that a DNA test is in order?
—Baby Is His Maybe
Dear Baby Is His Maybe,
Do you have a really good friend who doesn’t know your son well? Someone who you can call up and really dig into this issue, sort of like the phone call version of a true crime podcast? Go over everything you’ve observed about the hair color of all family members, what you know about genetics, and all of the awful qualities that make you believe your daughter-in-law is someone who would be unfaithful to your son. Lay it all out. Explore how things might unfold if a DNA test reveals that some other man really is the biological father of your grandson. Get it all out of your system because you are absolutely not allowed to say anything to him!
Plenty of people are the only redheads in their families (you can hear from dozens of them here!)—and it has a lot to do with genetics, which is explained nicely by geneticist Dr. D Barry Starr in his column. Read through these resources, and maybe you’ll be convinced.
But just remember: You do not have access to evidence of infidelity that others don’t have. Your son has eyes and can see his son’s head. What he chooses to think about what he sees is his business. Most importantly, really take stock of whether your suspicion will make you treat the child poorly, and if you don’t think you can be loving to him, keep your distance.
​​Nearly 50 years ago, my older brother gave me a nickname based on a fictional pig that was relatively close to my given name. It stuck until I put my foot down (and fists up) in my teenage years, and I had hoped that it was largely forgotten. My brother died four years ago, however, and my other siblings have somehow decided to “honor his memory” by reviving what was a cruel and hurtful jibe from a not particularly pleasant person…

Half-LifeHalf-Life 3Steam MachineValve 
Over the last few weeks, you might have noticed something odd. A lot of people seem to think that Half-Life 3 is about to be announced. Some folks have dates marked for when we should expect the sequel. There are even some who think Half-Life 3 will be announced at the Game Awards. And a lot of people seem to believe that Half-Life 3 is real and nearly finished despite, you know, Valve never confirming that. So uh, what’s going on?
Since 2021, dataminers have been finding and documenting many snippets of code left in other Valve projects, like DOTA 2, related to something known internally at Valve as “HLX.” And while Valve hasn’t told us whatÂ HLX refers to, fans and dataminers have connected a lot of dots over the last four years or so.
From what has been found, HLX appears to be a single-player, non-VR FPS featuring a character in an HEV suit who fights aliens and soldiers through various levels while possibly solving physics-based puzzles. Now, that sounds a lot like a new Half-Life game. And most of the community following HLX, as well as multiple reliable leakers, have started to call this datamined project Half-Life 3.
The fact that Valve has been working quietly on what appears to be a new Half-Life game for at least roughly five years, and likely longer than that, has created some hype online. But everything got kicked into high gear last week after Valve announced three new pieces of hardware: The Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller.
For many fans, already hungry for a new Half-Life game and convinced by dubious Reddit posts and TikToks that it was totally being announced soon, this hardware announcement from Valve was a very big deal. Valve often releases new games with new hardware, like Alyx with the Index and Desk Job with the Steam Deck.
So, naturally, many started to speculate that Valve’s next game, likely HLX aka Half-Life 3, would be announced soon and launched around the release of the new Steam Machine in 2026. Heck, even I think that might be possible. But then folks went into overdrive trying to predict the date HLX would be announced.
November 18 became a popular date for many. It would mark the six-year anniversary of Half-Life: Alyx’s announcement, the last Half-Life game, and would give Valve plenty of time to market the sequel before an early 2026 launch. Others believe November 19 is the magical date, as it’s the 27-year anniversary of the original Half-Life.Â 
People soon noticed that there’s a gap in sales events on Steam starting on November 18 and ending on December 8. Some theorized that this was because Valve wanted a clear runway for Half-Life 3‘s reveal, though it seems unlikely that Valve would delay sales for a new game reveal.
Then fans noticed Geoff Keighley, the creator and host of the Game Awards and master of video game reveals, only had one game on his Steam wishlist. When asked about it, he offered up some eye emojis. This threw people into a frenzy, despite the fact that Half-Life 3 doesn’t have a Steam page, so it can’t be added to a wishlist yet. Didn’t matter; this was evidence Half-Life 3 was going to be announced at Geoff’s annual trailer extravaganza, the Game Awards, in December.

The Game Awards tweeted about Half-Life on Wednesday, noting the anniversary of the first game’s release. People freaked. But, as pointed out by longtime Valve reporter and leaker Tyler McVicker, the Game Awards account tweets this same anniversary every year. (And does it for Half-Life 2, as well.)
But that didn’t matter either. At this point, people can’t ignore how many insiders, leakers, and reporters are hinting at some big announcement from Valve. Too many “clues” are being found by the community every day this week for fans to stop getting more and more excited. The hype levels are out of control. The hopium is off the charts.
But keep in mind that, officially speaking, Valve has not announced that a new Half-Life game is in development. Still, Valve did reportedly have a lot of extra security at their offices while revealing all the new Steam hardware. And the company does seem to have one more thing to announce, as its official Steam page lists two upcoming games, but only shows one, Deadlock. Is the other game Half-Life 3? The internet seems to think so.
As a longtime Half-Life fan who has been waiting a long time for Half-Life 3, I’m inclined to believe, though I’d also advise everyone getting excited right now to remember that this could all lead to nothing. Expect nothing and you’ll be pleasantly surprised with whatever we get.

          Members of Congress are getting rich trading stocks and flouting the current, toothless regulations.        
On paper, the idea of banning congressional stock trades has all the ingredients for success: supermajority support in polls, bipartisan sponsors, and public backing from House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.
Everything in Washington, however, is not as it seems.
Ahead of a House committee hearing on the flaws of the current rules on congressional stock trades, sponsors of the leading reform proposal were split on its chances. Some of the bill’s backers were even divided as to whether the hearing itself represented a genuine step forward — or, potentially, a delay tactic from House leadership.
Some proponents worry Johnson scheduled the hearing to placate them while kicking the can down the road on more concrete advancement, like marking up and voting on the measure.
The House speaker has expressed support for a stock trading ban, but he also said that he has “sympathy” for the counterargument that members need to wheel and deal in stocks in order to support their families.
“The speaker could have just gone directly to markup on this bill if he were supportive of it.”
“The hearing was positive and everybody was supportive of restricting congressional stock trading activity, but it’s sort of a delay tactic,” said Craig Holman, the Capitol Hill lobbyist for the nonprofit good governance group Public Citizen. “The speaker could have just gone directly to markup on this bill if he were supportive of it. He has expressed support of the concept, but not the bill itself.” (Johnson’s office did not respond to a request for comment.)
Rep. Seth Magaziner, D-R.I., hinted that the sponsors would be willing to push for a discharge petition — like the one that secured the release of the Epstein files — if Johnson does not move fast.
“Make no mistake, if this is not a step in the right direction but a delaying tactic, then other options will be on the table for how to get this bill to the floor,” Magaziner said. “We are glad to see some movement, but this is, we believe, just the first step, and the other steps need to come soon.”
Magaziner and his co-sponsors have been fighting for some form of a stock trading ban for years, in the face of mounting evidence that the law on the books has done little to curb self-dealing.
Current law has two major components: a transparency provision requiring that legislators disclose stock trades within 45 days, and another measure threatening lawmakers with jail time if they trade stocks based on insider information.
Neither part of existing law has teeth, witnesses told the House Administration Committee on Wednesday. The disclosure provision is routinely — sometimes flagrantly — violated by lawmakers who wait months to file disclosures. There is no public record of whether they have coughed up the paltry $200 fines.
Perhaps most importantly, the law has never triggered the criminal prosecution of a lawmaker accused of insider trading.
 
Representatives at the hearing ticked off examples of questionable Congressional traders. The husband of Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has drawn widespread attention for his profitable stock deals. Former Sen. Richard Burr, D-N.C., also executed a suspiciously well-timed sell-off of his holdings before Covid spread widely in the U.S.
The hearing highlighted the flaws of the current system, but it did not focus on any of the competing proposals to fix it.
Magaziner and co-sponsors, including Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., spent months crafting a proposal that could draw support from conservatives and liberals alike.
They have yet to receive a formal markup hearing that would precede a House floor vote on their bill, known as the Restore Trust in Congress Act.
Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., has threatened to force the bill onto the House floor with a discharge petition, the same mechanism that members used to force Johnson’s hand on the Epstein files.
One of the leading Republican co-sponsors of the Restore Trust in Congress Act, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., seemed far more confident than Magaziner that the bill will get a vote.
“We will get this done this Congress, mark my words. This bill, or a bill, will come to the floor,” Fitzpatrick said.

Public Citizen’s Holman said the bigger obstacle may lie in the Senate, where individual members have more sway and a group of Republicans including Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., have expressed their opposition. Johnson called one proposed stock trading ban “legislative demagoguery.”
Neither of the leading House and Senate bills apply to Trump and his family, who continue to trot the globe making lucrative deals in cryptocurrency and real estate. Holman said he hoped that someday the law will be strengthened to address the Trump family’s conflicts, but he doesn’t want to let perfect be the enemy of the good.
“Trump is a problem, and he is abusing this extensively,” Holman said. “So at this point, a great version would include the president, but I know if we do that, it’ll kill the bill in the House and the Senate with the Republican Congress.”
IT’S EVEN WORSE THAN WE THOUGHT.
What we’re seeing right now from Donald Trump is a full-on authoritarian takeover of the U.S. government. 
This is not hyperbole.
Court orders are being ignored. MAGA loyalists have been put in charge of the military and federal law enforcement agencies. The Department of Government Efficiency has stripped Congress of its power of the purse. News outlets that challenge Trump have been banished or put under investigation.
Yet far too many are still covering Trump’s assault on democracy like politics as usual, with flattering headlines describing Trump as “unconventional,” “testing the boundaries,” and “aggressively flexing power.” 
The Intercept has long covered authoritarian governments, billionaire oligarchs, and backsliding democracies around the world. We understand the challenge we face in Trump and the vital importance of press freedom in defending democracy.

Dour warnings of an AI bubble have rocked markets in recent weeks. At least one big concern is misplaced, though.
Back in March, I told you about depreciation risks for some AI companies, including CoreWeave. In August, Jim Chanos, the guy who shorted Enron, shared similar concerns.
The big worry centers on GPUs, the chips needed to train and run AI models. As new GPUs come out, older ones get less valuable, through obsolescence and wear and tear. Cloud companies must use depreciation to reduce the value of these assets over a period that reflects reality. The faster the depreciation, the bigger the hit to earnings.
Investors have begun to worry that GPUs only have useful lives of one or two years, while cloud providers depreciate the value of these assets over five or six years. An accounting mismatch like this could set the AI industry up for a nasty earnings hit in a few years.
This view has become almost a consensus on Wall Street now. It's one of the main pieces of evidence for the argument that we're in a huge AI bubble. The problem is that it's wrong: Even as Nvidia rolls out new GPU architectures every 18 months or less, GPUs aren't aging out nearly as fast as some investors fear.
""GPUs can profitably run for about 6 years,"" Stacy Rasgon, a leading chip analyst at Bernstein, wrote in a research report on Monday. ""The depreciation accounting of most major hyperscalers is reasonable.""
The cost of operating a GPU in an AI data center is ""very low"" compared to market prices for renting GPUs via the cloud. That makes the ""contribution margins"" of running old GPUs for longer quite high, Rasgon and his fellow analyst at Bernstein noted. (Contribution margins measure revenue left over after variable costs. It's a common way product profitability is assessed and business decisions are made).
""Even with meaningful improvements in price/performance with each GPU generation, vendors can make comfortable margins on 5-year-old A100s, in turn implying a 5-6 year depreciation lifespan is reasonable,"" the analysts added, referring to Nvidia's A100 chips, which came out in 2020.
To find out why these GPUs are so valuable for so long, it pays to speak with the people who actually run these components at scale inside AI datacenters.
Matt Rowe, senior director of strategic business development at AI cloud provider Lambda, said recently that the effective lifespan of GPUs can stretch to seven or eight years.
While most firms still use a six-year depreciation schedule for accounting purposes, warranty extensions and redeployment strategies are extending their useful life, he told Bernstein.
Warranty contracts are often overlooked by observers worrying about depreciation, Rowe explained. These warranties typically last five years, so if GPUs fail, they are replaced with new ones, extending the life of the overall GPU fleet.
He also noted that Amazon Web Services offered very early generations of GPUs, such as K80s, P100s, and V100s. These all lasted well beyond six years.
Nvidia's H100 GPUs, which debuted in 2022, are still running well inside Lambda data centers. Utilization is above 85% and Lambda hasn't cut its on-demand public cloud pricing for this GPU in more than 12 months, Rowe noted.
""We all think seven to eight years is possible,"" Rowe said.
I chatted this week with Erwan Menard, SVP of product management at Crusoe, which is developing the huge Stargate data center complex in Texas. Before joining Crusoe, Menard helped build Google's Vertex AI cloud service, so he's a real hands-on expert.
Menard described a lifecycle where GPUs migrate from cutting-edge AI model training jobs to less demanding inference workloads.
When creating a new state-of-the-art model, you need the latest and greatest GPU from Nvidia.
Then, you have to run these top models, a process called inference. That requires powerful GPUs, but not the latest ones.
Beyond that, there are thousands of different, valuable AI workloads that can run well on older GPUs, according to Menard. That means there are many GPUs that are multiple years old in Crusoe's fleet and are still actively used and profitable.
""Because there's a large diversity of models to solve many different problems, there's a lot of room to use GPUs for a long time, just transitioning them from one type of job to the next,"" Menard told me. ""It's actually a widely accepted view in the industry.""
AI cloud companies consider user expectations and budget to help them decide which GPUs to use. To illustrate, Menard described an example of an AI service that has a free tier and a paid version.
""You may decide that for the freemium version you're going to use an AI model that can be inferenced on older, cheaper hardware with lower performance,"" he said.
That's likely good enough to create an initial experience for users. Then, some customers might migrate to the paid version. At that point, you tap into a more powerful AI model that requires newer GPUs to deliver a superior user experience.
""We see a lot of these opportunities,"" Menard said. ""Not everything is a nail requiring one single mega-model running on the latest and greatest GPU.""
Some AI services are less compute-intensive and can be run on open-source models, such as Alibaba's Qwen, DeepSeek, or Meta's Llama offerings. One example is speech-to-text services (such as the transcription service I used to transcribe my interview with Menard).
Older or less-capable models can be run on older GPUs, while still providing valuable intelligence for AI services that customers will pay for. (Business Insider pays for those transcriptions, for instance).
As more startups embrace cheaper open-source models, older GPUs could actually be used even more. ""An open model may be absolutely great and give a more cost-competitive structure,"" Menard said.
Older GPUs use more energy to produce the same amount of intelligence, so another investor concern is that newer GPUs will always be preferred—aggravating this depreciation problem.
That's actually not true either, according to Menard. Older GPUs are cheaper to buy, so the fact that they consume more energy doesn't change the fact that older GPUs are often cheaper to run, when all costs are taken into account.
""The driver for a given GPU is going to be cost, first and foremost,"" he explained. ""So we go to the older ones because they're cheaper.""
So, I asked Menard for an example of an old GPU that Crusoe uses. He described new modular data centers Crusoe has built that are powered by recycled EV batteries from the startup Redwood Materials.
""I can put L40s from Nvidia in these data centers,"" Menard said. ""Because the whole deployment is energy-first in its design, I'm going to be able to make an impact.""
I hadn't heard of L40s and had to ask him what they were.
""That's an old GPU,"" he said, laughing.

87,2025-11-19,"Nine years after imposing a statewide alcohol ban to curb addiction, domestic violence, and financial ruin among its poorest families, Bihar - India's poorest state - still struggles to gauge the policy's effectiveness.
The gaps in implementation became glaring as the BBC shadowed Bihar officials in a misty October morning raid on bootleggers.
Armed excise officers, with a sniffer dog, sped across the Ganges on a boat to raid an illegal distillery.
On reaching the outskirts of the capital, Patna, the team found a ramshackle setup of a dozen metal drums - part of a makeshift apparatus fermenting jaggery, a type of cane sugar, into country liquor.
Vapour rose from the drums embedded in the riverside mud, the surfaces still warm.
The officers said the site was active minutes earlier, but the alcohol-makers had fled by the time they arrived. 
""They often get tipped off before a raid,"" an officer who didn't wish to be named said. 
Despite these enforcement gaps, alcohol prohibition remains firmly in place in Bihar.
Passed in 2016 by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar after persistent demands from women's groups, the law was among the factors that helped his Janata Dal (United) - Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alliance clinch a decisive state election victory earlier this month.
State officials tout the policy's success by pointing to big numbers: since the law took effect, 1.1 million cases have been registered and 650,000 people convicted for violations. But the devil lies in the detail.
More than 99% of these convictions are for consumption, rather than production, selling, or transport of illicit liquor. Moreover, alcohol remains widely available in the black market in Bihar. 
In the six weeks leading to the recently held election, illicit alcohol worth more than 522 million rupees ($6.26 million, £4.96 million) was seized from across the state. 
So why has Bihar been unable to enforce its ban more effectively?
Local police, who did not want to come on record, say it is a combination of several factors - including staff shortages, increasingly sophisticated smuggling methods and possible collusion between liquor makers and authorities.
""There are laws that prescribe life imprisonment or even the death penalty for murder. But does that stop people from committing murder? No, it doesn't,"" said Ratnesh Sada, an outgoing minister whose department handled prohibition issues.
Mr Sada, however, insisted that action has been taken against at least a hundred individuals engaged in illegal alcohol trade, with their properties seized.
""We destroy these setups, but within days they are up and running again,"" said Sunil Kumar, an excise official.
Bihar's geography makes enforcement even harder. The landlocked state borders Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and West Bengal -  all of which allow alcohol and serve as major sources of smuggled liquor. It also shares a 726km (449 mile), largely porous border with Nepal, which officials say has become a key conduit for alcohol smuggling, further complicating enforcement.
Despite the challenges, many women in Bihar -  who still carry deep scars from their husbands' alcohol abuse -  want the ban to continue.
In Chhapra district, Lalmunni Devi, who lost her husband after he consumed toxic liquor in 2022, said her life had been upended by alcohol abuse.
""I just hope no one else has to suffer the same fate,"" she said.
Neetu Devi, another widow, broke down as she recalled her husband's death.
""If the government were to shut down all such factories entirely, it [liquor] would no longer be available. It continues to be produced, and that's why people keep consuming it,"" she said.
Rajeev Kamal Kumar, an anthropologist at Patna's AN Sinha Institute of Social Sciences, who worked on a government study of prohibition, says both sides of the story are true.
""Many women and elders say prohibition has improved household finances, children's education, and nutrition. But it is undeniable that illegal trade continues,"" he said.
Bihar is neither the first nor the only Indian state to impose prohibition; several others have tried it over the years. But such measures often trigger unintended consequences - from thriving black markets and deaths from illicit brews, to enforcement challenges that drain state resources.
The financial cost has also been considerable, as alcohol taxes remain a key source of revenue for many state governments.
Gujarat and Nagaland have had bans since 1960 and 1989, yet both still grapple with bootlegging.
Mizoram imposed prohibition in 1997, lifted it in 2015, reinstated it in 2019, and then relaxed it again in 2022 to allow the manufacture, sale and export of wine made from local grapes.
Some other states have rolled back prohibition after encountering economic and administrative challenges.
For now, with the outgoing government slated to return to power, prohibition will remain in Bihar. But the policy remains a paradox - hailed as a social reform by some, criticised as ineffective by others.
Whether it has succeeded or merely shifted the problem underground is a question that continues to haunt the state.

We like to write science fiction thinly disguised as industry commentary, or vice versa, and we also really like Antiques Roadshow. This sturdy triangle offered unprecedented strip opportunities, the kind that leave precedented strip opportunities in the dust.  This, I thought. This is how we drive brand loyalty and earn share in crowded marketplace.

I told Kiko about the this strip yesterday, and he grew feral and snarled like a boar.  I learned that he had very serious opinions not only about Funko broadly but the Pops! so deeply associated with it. He drew word pictures with his mouth: a landfill-elegy, apocalyptic heaps of discarded figures cavorting in a death-orgy. I was like, okay man, jeez. I guess I won't buy you any Pops.  
The last time I was even consciously aware of these objects was when they made that boardgaming play, which I thought was cool as shit - partly because the Golden Girls were so OP.  The next thing I saw was when my feed told me a company I'd never heard of called PSA wasn't going certify the figures anymore, maybe because the Funko had delivered grisly financial news.  
Linear time began to fray.  Next I found myself in some kind of Reddit thread where people were gassing up the toys, saying that shit was actually kick ass, but I'm just reading about all this now. I'm not an expert on how tarrifs might affect the fortunes of collectible vinyl figures.  Maybe he was just clapping to keep a fairy alive (metephorical) until such time as he could shift his fairies (literal Pops) on the open market.  It never even occurred to me to buy toys as an investment! No doubt this is why I have fallen so far behind my peers.

From the MBA: Mortgage Applications Decrease in Latest MBA Weekly SurveyMortgage applications decreased 5.2 percent from
one week earlier, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association’s (MBA) Weekly Mortgage
Applications Survey for the week ending November 14, 2025.

The Market Composite Index, a measure of mortgage loan application volume, decreased 5.2 percent on
a seasonally adjusted basis from one week earlier. On an unadjusted basis, the Index decreased 7
percent compared with the previous week. The Refinance Index decreased 7 percent from the previous
week and was 125 percent higher than the same week one year ago. The seasonally adjusted Purchase
Index decreased 2 percent from one week earlier. The unadjusted Purchase Index decreased 7 percent
compared with the previous week and was 26 percent higher than the same week one year ago.

“Mortgage rates increased for the third consecutive week, with the 30-year fixed rate inching higher to its
highest level in four weeks at 6.37 percent,” said Joel Kan, MBA’s Vice President and Deputy Chief
Economist. “Application activity over the week was lower, with potential homebuyers moving to the
sidelines again, although there was a small increase in FHA purchase applications. Refinance
applications decreased as borrowers remain sensitive to even small increases in rates at this level. The
overall average loan size across both purchase and refinance applications dipped to its lowest level since
August of this year, driven by another drop in the ARM share.”
...
The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances
($806,500 or less) increased to 6.37 percent from 6.34 percent, with points remaining unchanged at 0.62
(including the origination fee) for 80 percent loan-to-value ratio (LTV) loans.

The first graph shows the MBA mortgage purchase index.

According to the MBA, purchase activity is up 26% year-over-year unadjusted. Red is a four-week average (blue is weekly).  Purchase application activity is still depressed, but above the lows of 2023 and slightly above the lowest levels during the housing bust.  The second graph shows the refinance index since 1990.
The refinance index has increased from the bottom as mortgage rates declined.

After weeks of negotiations between YouTube and Disney, YouTube TV subscribers finally learned they’ll get ESPN Unlimited at no extra cost. Unfortunately, there’s a catch. It looks like one of the most valuable sports packages still won’t be part of the deal. According to a new report from Puck’s John Ourand, MLB.TV will not be part of the ESPN Unlimited experience on YouTube TV, even after it moves under ESPN’s umbrella next year.
Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority?
Ourand reports that MLB’s out-of-market streaming service has finalized a new acquisition deal with ESPN and will be headed to its app starting with the 2026 season. The deal hasn’t been publicly announced yet, but it’s reportedly part of MLB’s broader three-year media shake-up with ESPN, NBC, and Netflix.
Ourand reports that even though ESPN Unlimited content will now appear directly inside YouTube TV, MLB.TV will not. Instead, MLB.TV may be available exclusively within the ESPN app and will most likely require a separate subscription.
This could be a big letdown for YouTube TV subscribers who’re on the service for baseball content. ESPN Unlimited was marketed as a major perk of the renewed Disney-YouTube TV agreement, bringing a range of live and on-demand ESPN content into the platform. Yet MLB.TV, one of the most sought-after sports add-ons, will remain unavailable on the service.
The move is apparently tied to MLB’s larger rights overhaul. ESPN opted out of its long-running Sunday Night Baseball package earlier this year. NBC is expected to take over Sunday Night Baseball and the Wild Card round, while Netflix will air the Home Run Derby and Opening Night. ESPN, meanwhile, gets a new weeknight game, the ability to house MLB.TV inside its app, and local games for the five teams whose broadcasts MLB controls.

We’re pretty sure Samsung is joining the Black Friday fun pretty soon, but I would be surprised if the official holiday deals can beat this one. Woot is offering the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra (2025) for only $369.99. That is a massive $280 discount.
Buy the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 for just $369.99 ($280 off)
This offer is available from Woot, an Amazon-owned deals website. You can pick between the Titanium Silver, Titanium Blue, and Titanium Grey color options. The only thing to keep in mind is that you won’t get a full manufacturer’s warranty. Instead, it comes with a 90-day Woot warranty.
The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra (2025) is among the priciest smartwatches on the market, priced at $649.99. This discount brings the price down to a much more reasonable $369.99. This is still a pricey watch, even on sale, but it is much closer to the rest of the market.
The only real competitor to the Galaxy Watch Ultra is the Apple Watch Ultra 2, and that one is only for Apple users. This means that the Galaxy Watch Ultra (2025) is the best option if you want a smartwatch compatible with your Android phone.
We are especially fond of the large 1.5-inch display, offering a sharp 480 x 480 resolution and an amazingly bright 3,000-nit brightness level. Even TVs and high-end mobile devices struggle to get to these levels!
This is an ultra-premium smartwatch, packed with numerous features. You’ll get very reliable GPS, cellular data support, a heart-rate monitor, exercise tracking, temperature reading, sleep monitoring, and more. Even the battery life is impressive. Based on our internal tests, it can last about three whole days on a full charge.
If we had to complain about one thing, it would be the design. It’s not bad, but it definitely isn’t for everyone. The rugged look is definitely unique, and it’s more for those who prefer a sportier look. It is quite resistant, though. The product is certified to IP68, 10 ATM, and MIL-STD-810H standards. You can submerge it to a depth of 100 meters for 10 minutes.
If you’re looking for the best mainstream Wear OS smartwatch, you can’t find anything better yet. The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra (2025) is fantastic, and at $369.99, it is definitely worth the upgrade. Here’s our list of the best smartwatches if you want to check alternatives.
The deal ends in three days or “until sold out,” so you might want to act quickly!

    The future may belong to AR glasses, but the present is all about VR. Here are my go-to options.
  
I've looked at VR and AR headsets for well over a decade, from Google Glass and the first demos of the Oculus Rift to peeks at the future of AR glasses and Android XR. Right now, VR has settled down to just a few players: Meta, Apple, Sony, Valve, HTC and Pico, with Google's looming Android XR partnership with Samsung waiting in the wings. In the world of AR and smart glasses, there could be a lot of changes coming: the Xreal One glasses, for instance, or the promise of Meta's Orion project.
But right now, VR is extremely good -- and still limited in how much it can do. I find my own use of VR headsets bouncing between Meta's Quest 3 and the Apple Vision Pro. But it's pretty clear there's one great VR headset pick of the moment, and it comes in two differently priced flavors.
The Meta Quest 3 offers mixed reality and improved display resolution and optics, and is $500 -- $3,000 less than the Apple Vision Pro. However, the newer Meta Quest 3S, a lower-cost version of the Quest 3 for $300, is an even better buy for entry-level VR adopters. I prefer the Quest 3, but there are plenty of people who will find the 3S to be a great choice for its price.
The Quest 3 and 3S both have newer, faster Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processors that produce better graphics and allow for higher-res color pass-through camera feeds than the Quest 2, and both have redesigned controllers. Both can create mixed reality effects by blending what the cameras see with VR graphics that are overlaid in the headset to look like AR. The Quest 3 has better lenses and a higher display resolution, but I prefer the feel of the Quest 3S eyepiece on my face, and the 3S also seems to have slightly better hand tracking in low light.
The Quest platform has plenty of side benefits: It has hundreds of games and creative or productivity apps, and several great fitness programs for effective cardio workouts. It can connect to PCs and even double as a work device if you have some patience. It also has hand tracking that works without controllers, but controllers are included to give you two input options. The Quests can even play “spatial” 3D videos shot on newer iPhones.

Meta's upgraded VR sequel to the Quest 2 feels like a notable revamp, with improvements across the board: a slightly smaller design, better, clearer lenses, a higher-res display, smaller controllers with better haptics and higher-res color cameras that can mix the real world and the virtual together. This ""mixed reality"" is similar in spirit to what Apple's Vision Pro will do but in a lower-res form for a lot less money. 
Read my review.
  
The Meta Quest 3S (Meta's replacement to my longstanding Editor's Choice headset, the Quest 2) is super-affordable at $300 and comes with updated graphics and color passthrough cameras that give the 3S the same gaming and mixed reality powers as the Quest 3. It's a fantastic budget buy, but Meta cut corners on the display and lens quality with the 3S, choosing to use the same fresnel lenses and LCD display as the Quest 2. It's perfectly fine for general VR and gaming, but the more expensive Quest 3's notably clearer lenses and crisper resolution are my favorite for all-day use and for reading text. The Quest 3S also comes with a free game, Batman: Arkham Shadow, adding to its value.
Read my review.
  
The PSVR 2 is expensive ($550), and needs a PlayStation 5 to even work. It's tethered, not wireless. And Sony hasn't supported the PSVR 2 with enough unique games to justify its existence. The PSVR 2 is still a fun luxury if you're a PS5 gamer who also owns a PC. Its HDR OLED display, graphics quality, built-in eye tracking and fantastic advanced controllers -- which have the same vibrations and adaptive force-feedback triggers as the PS5 DualSense controllers -- give this headset a premium feel that makes its best games perform at a different level. It has some exclusives like Gran Turismo 7, Resident Evil Village and Horizon: Call of the Mountain, but not enough.
Read my PlayStation VR 2 review.
  
The Apple Vision Pro is an amazing piece of tech and a bleeding-edge high-end mixed reality headset that also runs iOS and thousands of iPad apps, works without controllers using eye and hand tracking and can run multiple apps at the same time, along with being a virtual MacBook monitor. However, it's way too expensive for anyone but XR professionals and early adopters. The 4K micro-OLED displays are stunning, and videos and photos look fantastic. Apple’s device requires a tethered battery pack, is only made to work within Apple’s ecosystem and doesn’t have many unique apps yet at launch that do more than act as floating 2D screens. The Vision Pro could very well be the start of a whole new chapter in headsets and may turn into the best product in this whole category over time, but not right now for most people. At its current price and software limits, you’re better off waiting and trying a free demo instead. And, now that it's been around for over a year, it's hard to tell when Apple will update this headset to something with newer processors. The Quest 3 and 3S are far cheaper tickets to explore similar ideas in the meantime at a huge discount.
Read my Apple Vision Pro review.
  
Valve's headset isn't as cutting-edge as it was when it debuted in 2020, but its Steam VR and Vive hardware compatibility, excellent audio and fancy controllers still make it hardware worth considering. Valve's ""knuckle"" controllers are pressure-sensitive and can track all five fingers, making them almost like gloves. Not all apps make the most of them, but Valve's hardware is mix-and-match compatible with the HTC Vive, which also is built on the Steam VR platform. The Index headset has excellent audio, but its display resolution is no longer as good as competitors'. 
Read our Valve Index review.
  
Get ready for the most powerful Meta Quest yet. Dive into full immersion with brilliant 4K resolution and rich spatial audio, feeling like you're inside your favorite games. Stream shows on giant vibrant screens anywhere in your home, or enjoy the ultimate experience with Infinite Display’s widest field of view. With premium comfort and wireless design, you can move freely in workouts or take your headset on the go. And when you buy a Meta Quest 3 now, you’ll get $30 in Quest Cash.
Meta Quest Pro: This older, outdated, eye-tracking-equipped Quest headset can track facial expressions and has a crisp display, but the less expensive Quest 3 already makes it obsolete with its better graphics, cameras and display resolution.
HTC Vive XR Elite: The glasses-like design of the XR Elite is a sign of the future, but the software and performance of this headset don't justify its price.
PlayStation VR: The original PSVR still works on the PlayStation 4 and 5, but it's not compatible with PSVR 2 games and hardware. It still has some great games to discover, but its lack of dedicated controllers and awkward setup feels ancient.
Although mainstream VR headsets have been around for nearly a decade, the apps they run and the computers, phones and game consoles they work with keep changing. I run key apps and software on the headsets, using them mainly in standalone mode if they're designed to be self-contained, or with a PC, game console or phone if they're primarily meant as connected peripherals.
I use the headsets for a mix of work, gaming, fitness and creative uses, and stay attentive to where the headsets have pain points (moments of discomfort, feelings of disconnect or sensations of nausea or distortion). Using technology like VR can often be a highly subjective experience, but by being attentive to details I find I can discover where each product is uniquely useful.
Comparison is also key: I've looked at pretty much every wearable AR and VR device of the last 15 years and also covered a lot of the wearable tech, phone and computer landscape. How these devices work as game consoles, fitness devices, work accessories and social tools are all key areas. I also think about displays, audio, controllers and accommodations for eyeglasses.
VR and AR sometimes feel like product categories that never quite seem to become mainstream, but change is coming fast to the headset landscape.
Google and Samsung are introducing a new VR/AR platform later this year called Android XR. Samsung's Project Moohan is a Vision Pro-like headset that will also run Google's Gemini AI and plenty of Google Play apps. Expect Android XR to forge a bridge between Android phones and headsets and glasses, although it's hard to tell how fast that shift will happen. Samsung's headset, which doesn't have a price or release date yet, looks to be the only Android XR device in 2025. Android XR could be the future, but right now, it's hard to tell whether you should wait for it. Qualcomm's future plans for VR and AR lean on phones as a way to power smaller glasses, but so far there aren't any of these smaller devices that we'd recommend.
In the meantime, Apple's $3,499 Vision Pro headset -- a self-contained, standalone VR/AR device that Apple is positioning as a full spatial computer -- is the highest-price device on the consumer market, with a very different pitch than games-focused devices like the Meta Quest. Its ability to run all sorts of iOS apps and have multiple apps open at once make it a unique option, and its possibilities as an iOS mixed reality computer, paired with its fantastic display quality and unique input method of hand-eye tracking, might make it a promising device for creators, researchers and anyone with a large enough wallet to pay for a high-end personal cinema on their face. It also emphasizes things like computing and video quality instead of what are still the Quest's greatest strengths: gaming and fitness. But it's over a year old now, and Apple could be shifting to a more affordable version in the next couple of years.
The Vision Pro isn't the only mixed reality VR headset out there: Expect more in this category, which blends VR with video of your surroundings using color passthrough cameras that feel almost like augmented reality. The Quest 3 is the most affordable mainstream mixed-reality VR headset, and Apple's is the most expensive. Samsung's Project Moohan will also feature mixed reality, and I expect plenty more to come.
Sony's $550 PlayStation VR 2 delivers a great console gaming VR experience for PlayStation 5 owners and includes eye tracking like Apple's Vision Pro, but isn't wireless and is still a relatively expensive accessory (it costs more than the PS5 itself). It's more expensive than both the Quest 2 and Quest 3, and still needs a PS5 to work, but costs far less than a Vision Pro (although it serves a completely different purpose and relies on a limited set of PlayStation VR games to even function). Its more limited library and functions make it less versatile than a Quest, but a fun Quest alternative for anyone deep into Sony's PlayStation 5 ecosystem. However, the PSVR 2 right now feels like it's not really where the future of headsets is heading.
For PC owners, there are several options. You could use a Quest 3, Quest 3S, PSVR 2, or consider several existing devices. The biggest previous players in the PC VR gaming scene (Microsoft, Valve and HTC) have been quiet on that front, especially now that Microsoft has discontinued most of its mixed reality efforts and VR headset compatibility. That could change again soon. A PC-connected VR headset can offer the most versatile collection of software for an immersive VR experience, and it also lets you use that headset for creative and business tools. Steam is clearly the best conduit for PC VR right now.
The cost of a new VR headset is going up these days. If price is your biggest concern, the Quest 3S currently offers the best value in VR: a completely wireless experience, with access to a great library of fantastic games. "
