OpenAI announced a $38 billion partnership with Amazon's AWS on Monday, its first major cloud computing deal since striking a new agreement with Microsoft that gave it more flexibility.
OpenAI will use AWS compute, which consists of ""hundreds of thousands of state-of-the-art Nvidia GPUs,"" according to a joint statement between the companies.
Amazon shares were up more than 5% in premarket trading on the news. The deal is the latest example of a cloud provider leveraging its massive size to provide resources to compute-hungry AI companies.
The partnership also underscores OpenAI's ongoing desire for more computing resources to train and run its frontier AI models, as well as its consumer products, such as ChatGPT, as it races to achieve the holy grail in the AI race: AGI.
""AWS's leadership in cloud infrastructure combined with OpenAI's pioneering advancements in generative AI will help millions of users continue to get value from ChatGPT,"" the announcement said.
OpenAI's new definitive agreement with Microsoft, announced last week as part of OpenAI's restructuring to a more traditional for-profit business, removed the tech giant's power to have first refusal on cloud computing deals. Microsoft, an early investor in OpenAI, now has a roughly 27% in OpenAI Group PBC, a newly formed for-profit public benefit corporation.
OpenAI said it will use Amazon's AWS infrastructure ""to run and scale OpenAI's core artificial intelligence (AI) workloads starting immediately."" The announcement also says the partnership ""will have continued growth over the next seven years.""
""Scaling frontier AI requires massive, reliable compute,"" OpenAI co-CEO Sam Altman said in a statement. ""Our partnership with AWS strengthens the broad compute ecosystem that will power this next era and bring advanced AI to everyone.""
After starting last week with 14,000 layoffs, Amazon ended the week on a high note with third-quarter earnings topping expectations and disclosures about how the company has made progress on AI.
With AI companies' valuations growing, along with their spending commitments, there's been growing concern on Wall Street over a possible bubble amid increasingly circular deal structures and dependencies between leading companies.
Under Altman's leadership, OpenAI has paved the way for many of the recent blockbuster agreements. He and his top lieutenants have repeatedly said one of the biggest problems facing OpenAI is the lack of compute. All told, OpenAI has previously lined up $1.4 trillion in spending commitments in the coming years for roughly 30 gigawatts of capacity.
During a recent livestream, Altman said there have been conversations around OpenAI about how to build a compute factory that would allow OpenAI to create 1 gigawatt of compute per week.

Welcome back! Looking for something to watch? We have a new video podcast starring the great Katie Notopoulos and Emily Stewart. ""Well Spent"" covers how we buy, what we buy, and why we buy. Their first episode examines a doozy of a purchase: a home. Check it out here.
In today's big story, people are getting nervous about layoffs. It could be time to start planning ahead.
What's on deck:
Markets: Looking to invest in the AI data-center boom? There's an ETF for that.
Tech: How workers train Tesla's Optimus robot to act like a human.
Business: Social media is becoming a lucrative new side hustle for some military personnel.
But first, hope for the best but plan for the worst.
If this was forwarded to you, sign up here.
Halloween has come and gone, but the labor market is still feeling spooky.
Many workers see job security as a rarity these days. But instead of waiting for the proverbial axe to drop, some are getting ahead of layoffs in a variety of ways, writes BI's Jacob Zinkula.
Sometimes it's as simple as getting a jump start on job hunting while you're still employed. Other people Jacob spoke to diversified their income with a side hustle or picked up a second full-time gig.
While the approaches differed, the goal was the same: Don't get caught off-guard if cuts come.
That's sound advice regardless of the job market, but it certainly holds true these days.
The labor market has remained largely frozen for the past few months, with little to no hiring or firing. The slight thawing we have seen in recent weeks has been due to layoffs.
There has also been a rise in rolling layoffs where companies make multiple, small cuts as opposed to a single deep one. The approach is meant to help companies avoid cutting too deeply, but it doesn't do much for employee morale.
As if all of this wasn't nightmarish enough, don't forget the threat of AI. Companies seem keen to leverage the tech's efficiencies, which many interpret to mean lower headcounts.
Some of you might be dismissive of these layoff preppers.
""If you worked that hard on you're regular job, you wouldn't have to worry about getting laid off!""
But layoffs aren't always telegraphed, and even in their aftermath, the reasoning isn't always clear.
Take Amazon's recent job cuts. When the news was first announced, it was described as part of the company's goal to be leaner in the age of AI. One Amazon executive even encouraged employees in an internal memo to ""lean in on AI.""
But just a few days later, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the layoffs weren't AI-driven — ""not right now at least,"" he added — and were instead about culture.
So yes, maybe it doesn't hurt to be a bit proactive. And if you do end up getting bitten by the layoff bug, we've got you covered with what to do next.
1. This ETF could body the AI-data-center boom. The Tema Electrification ETF (VOLT) is poised to win big from the AI spending spree, according to analysts at Ned Davis Research. It's already beating the S&P 500, and analysts think it'll outperform the index by roughly 20% by 2027.
2. Leaving Wall Street for AI. When former Balyasny portfolio manager Barry Duong was under his noncompete period, he decided to learn about AI. Now, Duong leads AI strategy at startup Hebbia and thinks other Wall Streeters should also consider making the move.
3. How an ""accidental banker"" is running one of Wall Street's biggest deal machines. Houlihan Lokey CEO Scott Adelson told BI how the bank is positioning itself, from going on a hiring spree while rivals hold back to making targeted acquisitions.
1. What it's like to train Tesla's humanoid robot to be… human. Inside a glass-walled lab, dozens of Tesla workers act out the basic motions of everyday life — from wiping a table to lifting a cup — in an effort to train Optimus to move like a human. In conversations with BI, five current and former employees revealed what the job requires, including twerking, sprinting, and acting like a gorilla. One worker said that if their movements aren't deemed ""human enough,"" their performance is critiqued.
2. AI, but make it have feelings. Eric Zelikman, a top AI researcher who recently left xAI, is raising $1 billion for his new startup at a $4 billion valuation, according to sources. Humans& will build models that attempt to learn from and empathize with their users.
3. Amazon's rollercoaster week. On Tuesday, mass layoffs shook the Big Tech company. By Thursday, Wall Street was cheering a strong Q3 earnings report. Behind all of this, CEO Andy Jassy has been focused on changing the company's culture and proving its AI chops, BI's Eugene Kim writes.
1. One of the biggest competitions in San Francisco is shockingly low-tech. Getting your ad on billboards (yes, billboards) has become an ""insane competition."" It's largely thanks to AI startups with cash to burn that are looking to stand out. In some areas, billboard space is sold out for the next year.
2. A soldier's foray into social media stardom. Since becoming a social media star, Sgt. 1st Class Johnny Vargas said he now earns more money online than through the Army. For BI's series on military influencer culture, Vargas said he's on a mission to help other service members cash in, too.
3. The C-suite's best career advice. The truth is that there isn't a clear path when it comes to climbing to the top. It's often dependent on timing, the industry, personal networks, and more. Executives shared with BI the best career advice that's stuck with them.

With no end in sight to the government shutdown, investors are still operating in the dark amid the blackout in public data.
That's turning the market's attention to a handful of other updates this week, which could offer investors a glimpse as to what's happening under the hood of the US economy.
Those hints will come at a critical time for the market, which is heading into a historically strong time of the year for stocks. Investors, still buoyed by the AI trade, are digesting high-profile corporate earnings and watching to see any progress on the government shutdown, which is days away from becoming the longest in history.
Traders will be hungry for any updates on the job market. Markets have already missed out on the nonfarm payroll report for September, and will not receive a consumer inflation report for October.
Here's the data this week that investors will be parsing. 
Challenger, Gray & Christmas's monthly report of announced job cuts is due on Thursday.
That's expected to be front-and-center for investors, given that the Fed's rate cut trajectory depends largely on how strong the job market holds up from here.
Layoffs for the year rose to 946,426 at the end of September, the highest year-to-date total since the pandemic, Challenger said in last month's report.
""October's Challenger announced job layoffs report (Thu) is likely to show an increase, especially among technology companies,"" Ed Yardeni, the president of Yardeni Research, wrote in a note.
Investors will also be on the lookout for ADP private jobs data for October, which is set to be released on Wednesday. Economists are expecting the US private sector to have added 25,000 jobs for the month, up from a 32,000 loss for the month of September.
The ADP report is one of the data points that will ""carry more weight"" this week as the shutdown continues, Aaron Hill, the chief market analyst at FP Markets, wrote in a note.
""The recent trend continues to point to a weakening in hiring momentum,"" he said, adding that weaker-than-expected numbers in October could weigh on Treasury yields while supporting stocks.
The Institute for Supply Management is expected to provide an update on manufacturing activity and price growth in the sector on Wednesday. The Manufacturing PMI is expected to come in at 49.3%, a slight improvement from last month's reading of 49.1%.
Economists expect the ISM's Services Index, a gauge of the services sector of the economy, to come in at 50.3%, a slight improvement from last month's 50.0%.
""Should the release show any weakness in hiring or price pressures, this will bolster the case for a cut in December, while more robust readings will reinforce Powell's recent comments,"" FP Markets' Hill added.
In lieu of the official retail sales report from the US Census Bureau, investors will be taking in the Redbook Retail Sales Index on Tuesday. That will offer some insight into how the US consumer is faring. 
The new report will likely confirm that consumers are still spending money on goods at a ""solid pace,"" Yardeni said, citing the uptrend in official retail sales data over recent months.

I don't think I'll surprise anyone when I say that the fate of homebuyers — especially first-time millennial or Gen Z homebuyers — in 2025 is not exactly hunky-dory.
There's a lot of doom and gloom, and I don't want to fearmonger or ignore some of the bright spots in the overall housing market.
But here's a fact that will really make the hair on the back of your neck stand up:
In today's market, the average homeowner has to stay in their house for 7 to 9 years to make owning a better deal than renting. In the not-so-distant past, the rule of thumb was two to three years. That's according to Amanda Pendleton, home trends expert for Zillow.
I interview her during an interview on Business Insider's new ""Well Spent"" podcast, which I'm hosting.
With higher prices, interest rates, slower home value appreciation, and a booming stock market (where you could be putting your money if not sitting in a house) — the math has changed from the ""old rules"" on whether buying or renting is better.
Here's something even more wild: In really expensive markets like San Francisco or New York City, it takes 15 to 20 years to make buying a better deal than renting, Pendelton says.
In the first episode of ""Well Spent,"" Pendleton talks to us about how renting is no longer seen by many as just a step along the way to eventual home ownership, but rather as a reasonable financial and lifestyle choice for grown adults.
We also speak with Business Insider real estate correspondent James Rodriguez about how 2025 saw record home prices — $435,300 as the median price nationwide — and the forces that drove this.
Rodgriguez also delivers some unfortunate news about the potential for a ""silver tsunami"" of boomers vacating their homes. ""The people I've been talking to about this say it's more like a glacier, and will happen slowly,"" he says. ""It's not going to be this silver bullet for millennials who are waiting to get into the housing market.""
Don't worry, there's some good news, though. Rodriguez tells us what parts of the country are actually good places to buy now. And Pendleton says that compared to 2022 or 2023, buyers are starting to find things a little more favorable.
Pendleton's biggest piece of advice? Millennials should be spending more time shopping around for a mortgage rate before they even open up Zillow.
See the embedded video in this story to watch the first episode of ""Well Spent,"" a video podcast by Business Insider hosted by me (Katie Notopoulos) and senior correspondent Emily Stewart.
On ""Well Spent,"" we'll talk about how we buy, what we buy, and why we buy. And since a house is probably the biggest thing most people will ever buy (if they even do), it makes sense to start here.

Working on a single laptop screen is like trying to prepare a five-course meal in a studio apartment kitchen: constant minimizing of windows, lost tracking of tabs, and clicking back and forth between applications until your wrist hurts from all the mouse movement. There’s a great laptop screen extender on sale at Amazon that solves this by adding two full 14-inch displays that clip right onto your laptop, instantly creating a triple-screen setup: Amazon has dropped it from $239 to $189 which makes this the cheapest route into serious screen real estate without buying separate monitors and dealing with all that cabling.
See at Amazon
Each 14-inch screen delivers full HD 1080P resolution through IPS panel technologyÂ which means you get consistent colors and clear text from almost any viewing angle. That’s where IPS panels make all the difference; they avoid that annoying color shift and brightness drop you get from cheaper TN screens just from tilting your head a little. The 1920×1080 resolution gives you enough pixel density to keep text sharp and images detailed without having that fuzzy look budget monitors often suffer from. Both displays boast blue light filtering technology that reduces eye strain during long work sessions. That means it cuts the harsh blue wavelengths that mess with your sleep cycle and tire your eyes. The anti-glare coating scatters ambient light instead of reflecting it straight back at you so you can actually see what’s on screen even when sitting near windows or under office lighting.
Built-in speakers mean you get audio from the extended displays without needing separate speakers or relying on your laptop’s often mediocre sound system. At just 0.24 inches thick, these screens fold flat for transport and barely add bulk to your laptop bag.
The connectivity covers all the bases with two USB Type-C ports and one HDMI to USB-C port, which gives you flexibility in how you connect depending on what your laptop offers. Plug and play means exactly that-no driver downloads, no software installations, just connect the cables and your operating system immediately recognizes the extra displays. You can run both screens in extended mode to genuinely expand your workspace or switch into mirror mode for presentations where you want everyone seeing the same content. The triple-screen configuration legitimately increases your visible workspace by 200%, and lets you keep email open on one screen, your primary work on the laptop display and reference materials or chat windows on the third screen.
This extender works with Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems and supports game consoles like PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch to extend your game into multiple displays.
Studies regularly demonstrate that using a dual monitor setup increases productivity 20-42% over using a single screen and the gains are even higher when adding a third screen. This gain in productivity is realized by reduced window switching, better visibility for information, and the ability to retain tools, references, and communications visible all at once.
At $189, this extender is less than the cost of buying even one decent standalone portable monitor, yet you get two screens plus mounting hardware and all the necessary cables.

Most people just want a laptop that works without drama or over-engineering. Lenovo’s IdeaPad line is specifically designed with all the everyday scenarios in mind and peel away the extraneous gaming trim to focus on practical computing that normal people actually need. Right now, Amazon has dropped the Lenovo IdeaPad 1i down to $279 from its regular $399 price, bundling in a full year of Microsoft 365 alongside an impressive combination of 12GB RAM, 256GB SSD storage plus 1TB of cloud storage.
See at Amazon
The 12GB of RAM in this configuration changes everything about how budget laptops traditionally perform. Most entry-level machines ship with 4GB that starts choking the moment you open more than a few browser tabs but 12GB gives you real breathing room for multitasking across applications. You can run Word documents (you can download Word for free here) while researching in Chrome with YouTube playing in the background, all without that frustrating slowdown that makes budget laptops feel ancient. The Intel Celeron processor handles everyday computing tasks like email, web browsing, document editing and video streaming without breaking a sweat.
Storage comes in two forms that work together beautifully: fast local storage and massive cloud storage. The 256GB SSD provides fast local storage for your operating system, applications, and files you access regularly, delivering quick boot times and snappy performance that makes modern computers feel responsive. That is complemented by the massive 1TB of cloud storage through Microsoft 365 for backing up photos and everything else you want to keep safe but don’t need instant access to.
The 14-inch HD anti-glare display hits that sweet spot for portability and usability-large enough to handle comfortable work sessions without the bulk of a 15.6-inch model that barely fits into backpacks: That anti-glare coating does wonders when you work near a window or under strong overhead lighting and cuts down on the reflections that otherwise drive you to push brightness to uncomfortable levels. The screen manages to achieve an 87% active area ratioÂ which means Lenovo has been able to keep the surrounding bezels quite minimal to provide more screen area in a compact form factor. Two Dolby Audio speakers flank the keyboard and stream robust sound surprisingly well for video calls, streaming shows, or background music while working.
Battery life stretches to 11 hours on a full charge which is enough to get through a full workday or school day without hunting for outlets. WiFi-6 connectivity brings faster speeds and better performance in crowded wireless environments like apartments or dorm buildings where dozens of devices compete for bandwidth. The Flip to Start feature powers on the laptop the instant you open the lid and shaves off those annoying seconds of waiting while Smart Noise Cancelling automatically filters out background sounds during video calls.
Windows 11 is preinstalled and it performs all the modern computing tasks you’d want, from productivity software to entertainment apps. The bundled Microsoft 365 subscription includes all the Office applications you’d want, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook, along with that 1TB of OneDrive cloud storage we mentioned earlier. This software package alone usually costs about $70 per year so getting a full year included with the laptop counts as genuine added value rather than marketing fluff.
At $279, this Lenovo undercuts generic no-name laptops that often cost $400 or more while delivering inferior build quality and zero brand support.

7,2025-11-03,"Changpeng Zhao, the multibillionaire founder of crypto exchange Binance, spent four months last year locked in a federal prison. After US president Donald Trump pardoned Zhao in October, the government has recast him as a martyr.
Zhao, who goes by CZ, pleaded guilty in November 2023 to failing to maintain an effective anti-money-laundering program at Binance. In parallel, Binance admitted to violating US sanctions and settled with financial regulators, which accused the company of failing to report suspicious transactions involving terror groups, child exploitation networks, and cybercriminals, among other violations. In a particularly incriminating exchange detailed in court documents, one Binance employee said to a colleague, “We see the bad, but we close 2 eyes.”
As part of their respective settlement deals, Zhao agreed to forfeit his role as Binance CEO, and Binance agreed to leave the US, accept supervision by a US-appointed compliance monitor, and pay a record $4.3 billion penalty.
Less than two years later, the narrative has flipped. On October 23, Trump struck the charges from Zhao’s criminal record. The Binance founder was a victim of the “Biden administration’s war on crypto,” a White House spokesperson declared.
The decision to pardon Zhao will reverberate throughout the US crypto exchange market, which Binance could seek to reenter, legal experts claim. It may also come with long-term political consequences for the crypto industry after Trump’s presidency ends.
Whether Zhao’s pardon was justified has been hotly disputed, particularly in light of connections between Binance and World Liberty Financial, a crypto business founded by Trump and his sons. (Through a corporate entity, the Trump family owns a 38 percent stake in World Liberty Financial’s parent company.) In May, Binance agreed to receive a $2 billion investment denominated in USD1, a coin issued by World Liberty Financial, which could earn tens of millions of dollars from the arrangement. In July, Bloomberg reported that Binance had developed the codebase for USD1.
Remarkably, Trump claims to know very little about Zhao. “OK, are you ready? I don't know who he is,” Trump told 60 Minutes in an interview that aired on November 2. “I can only tell you this. My sons are into [crypto],” he said later in the interview.
Zhao’s legal representatives and industry allies have defended the pardon as a rightful corrective. “CZ is the first and only known first-time offender in US history to receive a prison sentence for this single, non-fraud-related charge,” wrote Teresa Goody Guillén, partner at law firm Baker & Hostetler, which represents Zhao, in a post on X.
As a result of the alleged appearance of nepotism, cronyism, and self-dealing in Trump’s crypto activities, members of the industry—which spent hundreds of millions of dollars supporting pro-crypto candidates in 2024 congressional races—are bracing for a retaliation by a future Democratic regime. Though the industry has won new laws specific to stablecoins during the Trump administration, some believe the window to pass broad-based crypto legislation is already closing.
“The [pardon] doesn’t look good,” claims Azeem Khan, founder of crypto startup Miden. “There’s going to be scorched earth to come with the midterm elections. There’s not enough being codified into law yet.”
“On balance, obviously the Trump admin has been good for crypto. There’s no denying that,” claims Nic Carter, general partner at crypto-focused VC firm Castle Island Ventures. But Trump “doesn’t care about the appearance of impropriety—at all,” Carter says. “His sons have been so active in the crypto industry. This has been my main complaint about the Trump administration.”
“Neither the president nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest,” said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt in a statement.
In the meantime, Zhao’s pardon could have a destabilizing effect on US-based crypto exchanges, for whom Binance now represents a latent threat. Their market has already been eroded by the arrival of crypto exchange-traded funds that allow people to invest in crypto through traditional brokerages.
In a strictly legal sense, the pardon changes little; both Zhao and Binance are still bound by the plea agreements, which prevent the founder from returning to an active role at Binance and prohibit the company from operating in the US, says Daniel Silva, partner at law firm Buchalter.
Equally, while Zhao’s criminal record has been erased, his testimony has not. “He still admitted to all those things under penalty of perjury,” says Silva. “While he’s no longer technically a felon, that doesn’t negate the admissions that he made.” Prospective business partners will still take those admissions into consideration, he says.
But the pardon opens the door for the US government to formally release Zhao and Binance from their obligations, claims Silva. Meanwhile, faced with a US Department of Justice that has abdicated responsibility for policing certain crypto-related crimes, Zhao may feel emboldened to return to an active role at Binance either way. “You can breach any contract you want. The question is what consequences will there be?” says Silva.
Binance and Zhao did not respond to requests for comment. But in an X post thanking Trump for the pardon, Zhao wrote, “Will do everything we can to help make America the Capital of Crypto.” Earlier in the year, The Wall Street Journal noted, Zhao quietly changed his biography on X, swapping “ex-binance” for just “binance.”
The US crypto exchange market is dominated by Coinbase, which has long pitched itself as the straightlaced, law-abiding alternative to freewheeling international counterparts. But Binance is the largest crypto exchange in the world, processing around $22 billion in trades each day, almost eight times more than Coinbase.
The systemic importance of Binance to crypto markets is generally underappreciated in the US, some claim. “There’s an ethnocentrism people in North America have about being the best,” claims Khan. “Coinbase is in many ways the company. But Binance is the company for the rest of the world.”
With its immense financial resources, Binance could squeeze the margins of smaller US-based competitors who cannot afford to pursue loss-leading strategies for attracting customers—like slashing trading fees.
To gird itself against heightened competition, Coinbase has set out on a shopping spree. In the past year, Coinbase has acquired a derivatives exchange, an angel investment platform, and a service for launching crypto tokens, and it has partnered with PayPal and American Express on new services. The effect is to erect a walled garden of sorts, says Khan, that incentivizes customers to remain within Coinbase’s orbit and diversifies revenues away from trading fees. “Competition is coming. I think that’s why Coinbase has been so aggressive for some time now,” says Khan.
Coinbase declined to be interviewed for this story.
The US exchange market will ultimately trend toward consolidation, experts predict. “Fees get squeezed, and you have to scale to win,” says Chris Perkins, partner at crypto venture capital firm CoinFund. “There’s going to be some holy or unholy alliances.”
Though Trump’s far more permissive stance towards crypto stands to lift the entire industry, some are concerned by the administration’s ability to essentially select winners and losers—by effecting specific policy changes or pardoning founders, say.
“You want to win, but you want to win in a legitimate way,” claims Carter. “You don’t want your wins to be tinged by the appearance of corruption. You want to operate in a market economy, not a command-and-control economy where your ability to penetrate Washington determines whether you win or not.”

OpenAI just inked another multibillion dollar deal.
The AI giant will pay Amazon $38 billion over the next seven years to gain access to the company’s AI infrastructure, the two companies announced on Monday.
OpenAI will use Amazon’s data centers (which themselves rely on Nvidia chips) to train new AI models and serve inference for ChatGPT. The deal might also expand to include millions of central processing units to power OpenAI’s agentic AI ambitions, Amazon said in a press release.
All of the targeted capacity will be deployed by the end of next year and could expand further after 2027.
The computing deal, which is the first partnership between OpenAI and Amazon’s cloud infrastructure arm AWS, comes on the tails of OpenAI’s recapitalization last week, which saw the AI giant finally becomeÂ for-profit.
Under the new structure, Microsoft gave up its right of first refusal to be OpenAI’s computing supplier, but will continue to have intellectual property rights to OpenAI models through 2032 and will hold a 27% stake. Following the restructuring announcement, Reuters reported that OpenAI was planning for an IPO as early as next year.
The newly minted AWS-OpenAI partnership is also just the latest in a substantial dealmaking spree surrounding Sam Altman’s company.
All within the past few months, the AI giant has signed a $300 billion data center partnership with Oracle, a $10 billion custom in-house AI chips deal with Broadcom, and expanded its CoreWeave deal to $22 billion. On top of that, OpenAI also scored a $100 billion investment by Nvidia, grabbed a 10% stake in chipmaker AMD, and agreed to purchase $250 billion of Microsoft’s Azure services.
All in all, OpenAI’s computing deals so far have topped $1 trillion, according to a report by the Financial Times.
The AI industry has become one infinitely expanding and tangled web of multibillion-dollar investments, made by a handful of giant tech companies with overlapping interests.
At the heart of this web are the two companies that have become synonymous with what industry analysts call the “AI revolution”: Nvidia and OpenAI.
With each deal, the tech giants inject more money into the system, enjoy a boost in share prices and hit market capitalizations that have never even been dreamed of before. Just last week, less than a day after announcing a series of partnerships worth billions of dollars, Nvidia became the only company in history to be worth $5 trillion.
If all goes according to plan, these circular investments could continue to build up the market and U.S. economic growth. But if AI breakthroughs slow down, or for any reason, demand doesn’t pan out the way these companies have imagined it would, then it creates huge risks for the global financial system. Because the system is so tightly-wound right now that no mistake will be isolated: if one company goes down, then they all go down together.
That has only supercharged fears of an AI bubble for skeptics. If AI adoption is limited, as skeptics fear might be the case, then these circular deals could be considered “round-tripping,” analyst Rishi Jaluria told Gizmodo last month, aka making trades to artificially prop up an asset and make it seem more valuable and in demand than it actually is.
For now, there is no consensus on how AI demand is going to scale, so we will have to wait and see what the true impact of this trillions-worth dealmaking spree is going to be.

    Ayaneo promises the device will be ""a mobile phone truly made for gamers.""
  
Ayaneo, which makes retro gaming handhelds, plans to introduce its first phone product.
Ayaneo, the Chinese company that manufactures handhelds and mini PCs for gaming, is entering the smartphone market.
The company teased across social media a new product, the Ayaneo Phone, that it said will be ""a mobile phone truly made for gamers.""
Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.
A YouTube video showing only the back of the device revealed it to be a black smartphone with two cameras, an LED light and what appear as dual shoulder buttons that could be used when the phone is held horizontally. The video and the caption text didn't include any details about the phone's features, release date or pricing, only a QR code for the company's Discord server.
A representative for Ayaneo did not immediately respond to a request for more information.
CNET's review of Ayaneo's Android-based Pocket S gaming portable was positive, but found the pricing, lack of a headphone jack and fan noise to be dealbreakers for a device starting at $559.
Commenters on YouTube said some of the features they'd like to see most on the Ayaneo phone include a 3.5mm headphone jack, an SD card slot and stereo speakers.
A mobile phone focused on gaming could be a natural progression for a company that's been experimenting with a wide array of form factors -- including some with full keyboards -- for its handheld products.
""Ayaneo moving from the gaming handheld market into phones might actually make a lot of sense,"" said CNET Senior Editor Mike Sorrentino. ""The company already makes Android-based gaming devices and making one a true phone could make it a more natural companion.""
Sorrentino pointed out that to get into the mobile phone space, Ayaneo will need to do more than deliver games on good hardware.
""A common issue with the current gaming phone market is software and security support, which is especially critical for keeping your phone secure. So I hope that a new gaming phone hitting the market prioritizes that and not just its hardware specs,"" he said.
CNET Senior Reporter David Lumb added that gaming phones have not traditionally sold well, with only a few companies, such as Asus and Red Magic, having achieved some modest success. 
Lumb said that while Ayaneo is using higher-end Snapdragon processors in some of its Android devices, retro games in a smartphone may not need that much power. 
""While this could and likely does mean better performance, a lot of older games on such handheld devices don't need that muscle, only when emulating more relatively recent consoles,"" he said."

Steve Cohen's $41.5 billion firm will break its fundamental stock-picking unit into two separate brands starting in January.
Point72 Asset Management is launching two new brands — Point72 Equities and Valist — according to an internal memo from Steve Cohen and Harry Schwefel, the firm's co-chief investment officer, seen by Business Insider. Valist, trademarked last month, will start with about a dozen investing teams across various sectors, the memo said.
The two units will report to the same leadership, helmed by Schwefel, and ""will share the same best-in-class resources and collegial culture,"" the memo, which went out to employees Monday, said. Where the two brands will differ will be where they sit in the office — a person close to the firm said they'll operate from different floors — and their relationships with Wall Street banks.
Point72 declined to comment.
A driving factor in the creation of Valist is sell-side coverage, the memo notes. As Business Insider previously covered, the growth of multistrategy funds like Point72 and its peers, including Millennium and Citadel, has changed the relationship between investment bank counterparts and buy-side firms, particularly around corporate access.
With a separate brand and commercial relationship with Wall Street, portfolio managers operating under different names will be able to gain more access to CEOs of companies they trade and research, as well as receive insights from bank analysts, despite still working for the same fund.
Point72's main peers in the industry have structured their stockpickers in a similar fashion.
At Ken Griffin's $69 billion Citadel, for example, the firm has four different fundamental equities units: Global Equities, Surveyor, Ashler, and International Equities. Balyasny has PMs operating under its Corbets brand and, soon, Peter Goodwin's Longaeva Partners in addition to its main equities unit, for which a majority of stockpickers work.
The two brands at Point72 will ""position ourselves for further growth,"" Cohen and Schwefel wrote.
""Our fundamental equities strategy has been the flagship of our firm for over 30 years, and we look forward to building on that foundation,"" the memo notes.

Sam Altman appears tired of having to justify how OpenAI will pay for its trillion-dollar-plus spending commitments as a startup bringing in a fraction of that in annual revenue.
In a testy moment during a recent podcast interview with investor Brad Gerstner on the ""Bg2 Pod,"" Altman was asked ""the single biggest question"" that is ""hanging over the market.""
""How can a company with $13 billion in revenues make $1.4 trillion of spend commitments?"" Gerstner asked the OpenAI CEO. ""You've heard the criticism, Sam.""
OpenAI has invested heavily in infrastructure and compute, striking multi-billion-dollar deals to secure more Nvidia chips and energy to fuel its AI ambitions. The latest came Monday morning, when OpenAI announced a $38 billion partnership with AWS.
""If you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer,"" Altman said in response to Gerstner's question. ""Enough.""
Altman disputed the $13 billion in OpenAI revenue that Gerstner listed before launching into a greater defense.
""I think there's a lot of people who talk with a lot of breathless concern about our compute stuff or whatever that would be thrilled to buy shares,"" Altman said. ""We could sell your shares or anybody else's to some of the people who are making the most noise on Twitter about this very quickly.""
AI bubble discourse on ""Twitter"" — now X, owned by Altman's friend-turned-foe Elon Musk — has reached a fever pitch amid tech companies' increasing capex spending. On Meta's recent earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company was intentionally ""front-loading"" compute. In the ""very worst case,"" Zuckerberg said, Meta will have ""pre-built for a couple of years.""
""We do plan for revenue to grow steeply,"" Altman said on the podcast. ""We are taking a forward bet that it's going to continue to grow.""
Altman listed some of the company's bets: ChatGPT, consumer devices, its cloud business, and the automation of science. The company also recently announced a plan to monetize its viral Sora app by charging for additional AI video generations.
To push forward these bets, OpenAI has inked spending deals with several companies, some in the hundreds of billions. The deals range from chips to data centers, and include names like Nvidia, Oracle, and AMD.
""There are not many times I want to be a public company, but one of the rare times that it's appealing is when those people are writing these ridiculous, 'OpenAI is about to go out of business,'"" Altman said on the podcast.
""I would love to tell them they could just short the stock, and I would love to see them get burned on that,"" he added.
Now that OpenAI has completed its restructuring plan and signed a new agreement with Microsoft, its largest investor, there have been murmurs of OpenAI's IPO aspirations. A recent Reuters report indicated that OpenAI was angling for an IPO at a $1 trillion valuation.
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who was also on the podcast, broke out in laughter when Altman said he would help Gerstner sell OpenAI his shares. Later, Nadella chimed in as a ""partner and an investor"" to say that OpenAI's business execution has been ""unbelievable.""
""We carefully plan,"" Altman said. ""We might screw it up. This is the bet that we're making, and we're taking a risk along with that.""
""A certain risk is if we don't have the compute, we will not be able to generate the revenue,"" he said.

Chicago always has something to prove. When it went up against New York for the 1893 World's Fair, a New York Sun reporter called out its ""windbag"" campaigners. Illinois ended up hosting the fair, and Chicago embraced its new identity as the Windy City. That chip-on-the-shoulder energy still defines this metropolis, a city that builds, innovates, and competes like it has everything to lose.
Chicago’s tech scene is a diverse landscape that shouldn’t be slept on—but you probably know that. Over the past decade, the Second City’s tech sector has grown by 18 percent, adding more than 106,000 direct jobs and nearly 150,000 indirect jobs, according to the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce. The city’s universities produce more computer science graduates than anywhere else in the country. Giants like Google, Salesforce, and Meta have expanded here, while startups like Tegus, Uber Freight, and G2 have relocated from Silicon Valley, drawn by Chicago’s talent pool and more affordable cost of living.
Chicago's tech scene is not siloed; nearly half of all tech positions are tied to core industries like health care, finance, and logistics. In August, the TechChicago conference spotlighted quantum computing, energy-efficient data centers, and equitable access to capital, demonstrating that Chicago is thinking about how technology can enhance everyday life.
To be in Chicago is to work hard, play harder. Dinner in Fulton Market, drinks on the Riverwalk, and a comedy set to close out the night.
While Chicago’s tech scene spans the city, chances are your work trip landed you somewhere in the Loop, River North, or West Loop area. Our lodgings keep you close, comfortable, and surrounded by fellow professionals.
363 E. Wacker Drive, (312) 787-3447
Where the Chicago River and Lake Michigan meet, the St. Regis delivers the city’s pinnacle of luxury, complete with a world-class spa, fitness facilities, and acclaimed dining. The Signature Butler Service takes care of unpacking, suit pressing, shoe shines, and morning coffee (or tea), so you can focus on the business that brought you here. A complimentary house car can get you to nearby meetings or lunches within a 2-mile radius. Start with the Tokyo Breakfast at Japanese restaurant Miru, return at 5 pm for the hotel’s daily champagne sabrage, then head to Tre Dita for handmade pasta and Tuscan wood-fired steaks—be sure to reserve ahead.
200 N Green St., (312) 761-1700
If you want a hotel that feels like part of the city, it’s the Hoxton in the West Loop. Check in and out anytime when you book directly. Workspaces are available, from library desks to coworking spaces and meeting rooms. If you’re hungry, the on-site café serves Aya Bakery pastries and coffee, and if you need a break, daybeds await, which are ideal for a power nap or nursing a hangover. Weather permitting, their outdoor terraces double as another place to get work done. You don’t even have to leave the Hoxton to hit the neighborhood’s hottest dining and drinking spots; Cira serves Mediterranean-inspired eats all day, Cabra Cevicheria dishes Peruvian bites on the rooftop, head downstairs to Lazy Bird for cocktails and live music Thursday through Saturday, and Milk Bar is also in-house for a late-night sugar fix.
311 N Morgan St., (312) 764-1919
In Fulton Market, the Emily Hotel is perfect for travelers who want a local vibe with all the luxuries and tech conveniences. Grab a coffee at the in-house coffee bar, lunch at Fora, cocktails at rooftop bar Selva, and dinner at Sushi by Bou. Stay active in the 24/7 fitness center, and if the weather permits, catch a film at the hotel’s terrace cinema.
900 E Grand, (872) 710-5700
At Sable, you’ll have everything you need for an enjoyable stay. Grab a coffee in the lobby at Kisbi, where single-origin beans from Costa Rica, Kenya, and Ethiopia make your morning feel instantly richer. Lirica, the Spanish- and Iberian-inspired restaurant, is perfect for a solo lunch or team dinner. The Offshore Rooftop has unbeatable views of the skyline and Lake Michigan, plus a full-service bar. As for amenities, there’s a 24-hour fitness center, meeting rooms if you need to get work done, and, of course, Navy Pier itself just outside your door—full shops, restaurants, and attractions to keep you entertained. It’s a bit like living in a mall.
505 N Michigan Ave., (312) 944-4100
In the heart of the Magnificent Mile, the InterContinental blends big-city business energy with old-school glamour. That’s partially thanks to its indoor pool, a 1929 stunner tiled in Spanish Majolica and watched over by a terracotta Neptune fountain, floating 14 stories above Michigan Avenue. During the week, you’ll mostly see business travelers, though families often stay here, too. The practical amenities are covered, including meeting rooms, printing services, and even a notary, if needed. There are two on-site restaurants: Casa Chi leans Japanese Peruvian with great cocktails, and Michael Jordan’s Steakhouse is exactly what you think. There’s also a Starbucks in the lobby, but with so many better local cafés nearby, it’s worth wandering out.
You can work from any of the hotels on our list, but if you need a change of scenery, Chicago has plenty of coworking options, too. Below are some of our favorites, and Deskpass is a great resource for more options.
20 N. Wacker Drive, 12th Floor
Inside the Civic Opera Building in the city’s business district, this 60,000-square-foot workspace is designed for tech professionals. Fast Wi-Fi, ergonomic setups, meeting rooms, and even a rooftop terrace and fitness center. Drop in for $35 a day on Deskpass.
3130 N Rockwell St.
In Avondale, Guild Row offers a sunlit workspace with high ceilings, private Zoom booths, and a café and bar for breaks. The Belmont Room hosts workshops, talks, and events, but the overall atmosphere is calm and focused for getting work done without distractions. It’s a space to recharge, meet like-minded people, or settle in for a productive day. You can purchase a day pass for $28.
1821 W Hubbard St Unit 209
In the West Loop, Art/Work Coworking is a creative lab that draws in the city’s creatives, techies, and freelancers. Open 24/7 with automated access, it offers desks and bookable meeting rooms. Drop in with Deskpass, or book a conference room starting at $50 an hour.
112 N Green St.
If you need a reliable off-site work spot, Sawada Coffee has plenty of seats, strong Wi-Fi, and strong coffee. Founded by Japanese barista Hiroshi Sawada, Sawada Coffee is renowned for the Military Latte—a rich jolt of matcha, espresso, and cocoa—but they also have cortados, cappuccinos, and cookies on hand to keep the workflow steady. If you linger into lunch, you don’t have to go far; Sawada shares its space with Green Street Smoked Meats, known for its Central Texas–style barbecue.
714 N Wells St.
Owned by Palestinian American friends, Oud Coffee is a River North favorite for craft lattes and bites. The signature Oud latte blends pistachio syrup, cardamom spice, and fresh mint, while the menu also includes Turkish coffee, tea, and smoothies. Snack on Manakeesh flatbread, stuffed dates, or baklava. Spacious indoor seating makes it a solid spot to catch up on work, or sit outside if the weather permits. There’s another location in Wicker Park, should you find yourself closer to that neighborhood.
5531 N Clark St.
The Understudy is a theater-bookstore-slash-café, with passion fruit syrup on offer alongside lavender, wild rose petal, and hazelnut. Non-coffee drinkers can sip iced ube lattes, sparkling matcha lemonades, or a lychee roasted goddess tea. Come for the flavor, stay for the creative atmosphere, with light-filled nooks that make it easy to lose an afternoon.
3101 S Morgan St.
Bridgeport Coffee has been roasting on the South Side since 2004, and it’s still one of the city’s best stops for a cup of coffee that actually tastes like where it came from. The shop sources beans directly from growers, cutting out middlemen for better flavor and fairer trade. There are only a couple of counter seats and a handful of tables, but it’s a cozy place to work if you snag a spot.
Chances are, Chicago’s hottest eateries will be booked solid, but we’ve found the sweet spots that actually have availability.
2165 N Western Ave.
For a kitschy yet upscale take on the American Chinese takeout you grew up on, Chef’s Special delivers saucy, family-style classics. Think orange chicken, Mongolian beef, and lo mein noodles—fast. The nostalgic comfort food is paired with tropical cocktails, from a lemongrass gimlet to an $8 shot-and-beer combo. Ideal for small teams or clients, the menu encourages sampling, making it less about individual plates and more about the experience.
800 W Randolph St.
At Au Cheval, Chicago’s über-celebrated burger joint, the melty, egg-topped cheeseburger lives up to its hype. The vibe is low-key, with a diner-meets-French-speakeasy feel, featuring dim lighting, leather booths, and an open kitchen that's always at full capacity. You have to get the cheeseburger, but the chilaquiles and roasted bone marrow are also worth ordering. There are no reservations; swing by on a weekday afternoon, put your name down, and grab a drink at one of Fulton Market’s many bars while you wait.
2024 N Halsted St.
Cafe Ba Ba Reeba! has been the city’s tapas spot; the menu leans on shareable plates that pair well with pitchers of sangria: pintxos, tapas, and paella. The Lincoln Park location buzzes with energy, but if you can’t snag a reservation, the sister outpost Lil’ Ba-Ba-Reeba! is in River North and offers a similar vibe. Ideal for team dinners or client meetings.
700 N Clark St.
Ambar is inspired by the communal Balkan tradition of “Voz,” where food is brought out to the table in a continuous procession. For a set price, you can order from more than 40 Balkan dishes. Grilled meats, slow-cooked seafood, stuffed pies, cheesy flatbreads, creamy spreads, and desserts I keep coming back for. Everything comes in small plates, so you can order seconds (or thirds) of your favorite dishes without shame. For visiting execs, the all-you-can-eat model is a chance to entertain colleagues without the hassle of menu math, and the abundance keeps the conversation flowing.
Ask any Chicagoan, and they will insist that Chicago pizza is actually a crispy, tavern-style pie. But if you must try deep-dish pizza, skip the touristy Lou Malnati’s and get Pequod’s instead. For Chicago-style pizza, some local favorites are Paulie Gee’s, Professor Pizza, and—my personal favorite—Zarella Pizzeria & Taverna, which offers both thin artisan and tavern-style pizza. If you manage to snag a reservation, order the Spicy Vodka pizza, the gooey mozzarella sticks, and the pineapple brown butter cake. You can thank me later.
Portillo’s is for tourists. If you want a real Chicago dog, head to Superdawg or the Wieners Circle.
Chicago drinks hard. Survive your first Malört shot at the stickiest dive bar you can find, then check out the city’s barcades and breweries, where you can unwind, catch up with colleagues, or just enjoy the city.
1221 W Blackhawk St.
I love grabbing a drink at the Goose Island Pub before catching a show at the Salt Shed. On sunny days, the riverside patio and skyline views are so serene. Inside, it’s industrial but comfortable, lively enough to still feel connected to the city. The tap list mixes Goose Island classics with experimental brews, barrel-aged bourbon, and seasonal rotations. Goose Island’s main taproom in West Town is also worth a visit if you’re in the area, but the Salt Shed venue has a built-in concert ambiance that makes it the perfect pregame joint.
213 W Institute Pl.
Downtown Chicago doesn’t overflow with true barcades, but Headquarters Beercade scratches the itch. The draw is the dozens of arcade cabinets and a decent lineup of Stern pinball machines, all on free play, yet the vibe skews more corporate happy hour than underground gamer hangout. If you want to sip on craft beer while mashing buttons on Street Fighter II, this is the place.
839 W Fulton Market
With three locations across the city, you won’t have to go far to find Emporium. Wicker Park is usually the busiest, and the West Loop location is a perfect stop before dinner at Au Cheval. Expect skee-ball, pinball, and pool tables running on tokens, plus a drink menu that rotates in local brews and seasonal hard kombuchas. Don’t count on every machine working, but Emporium is less about high scores and more about blowing off steam over a beer; the games are just a bonus.
3540 N Clark St.
Sluggers has been a Chicago staple for over 35 years. With over 40 TVs streaming games, and walls stacked with sports memorabilia, it’s the liveliest sports bar in the city. Upstairs, you’ll find batting cages, skee-ball, and other arcade games.
2833 N Sheffield Ave.
Replay in Lincoln Park is a dive-bar-meets-party with a lineup of rotating craft beer and cheeky cocktails like “Shrek Is Love” and “Not My Gumdrop Buttons.” Most arcade games are free to play, with the newest Stern machines reasonably priced. There’s always a theme that leans into ’90s nostalgia, and weekend DJs keep the energy high. The crowd is cool, diverse, and unmistakably Midwestern. This is reviewer Louryn Strampe’s go-to spot for pinball and beer before catching a show at the Point.
You haven’t really done Chicago until you’ve laughed through its comedy scene, home to the legends of both stand-up and improv.
230 W North Ave.
Second City is the birthplace of improvisational comedy, not to mention that it has launched more SNL cast members than you can count (Dan Aykroyd, Tina Fey, Bill Murray, Amy Poehler … I can go on). You can’t go wrong with the mainstage show, but the lineup branches out into family-friendly matinees, late-night experiments, and seasonal sets. If one show sells out, there’s always another around the corner—literally, the venue runs multiple stages at once.
1548 N Wells St.
Zanies is as classic as it gets for stand-up, where legends and up-and-comers share the same tiny stage. It has a low-ceilinged, brick-wall intimacy that feels exclusive. On weekends, you might catch a touring comic; on weeknights, it’s roast battles, showcases, and the kind of rowdy energy that feels more underground than you’d expect from a venue this iconic.
3175 N Broadway
Sure, this isn’t the OG comedy club on Sunset Boulevard, but Chicago’s Laugh Factory has carved out its own scene. The vibe is more Midwestern grit and quick wit, and the rainbow-arched stage is just as legendary in person. The “Chicago’s Best Standup” nights rotate through the city’s local comics, and you never know when a bigger name will drop in unannounced. You’ll also find open mics and themed shows that keep nights unpredictable.
1331 N. Milwaukee Ave.
In Wicker Park, the Den Theatre hosts both comedy shows and theater productions, with multiple black box stages and cabaret setups tucked into its brick-and-beam interior. The shows range from local stand-ups testing new material to nationally touring headliners dropping in for intimate sets. Between shows, the lounge and bar make it easy to linger and take photos with the talent.

13,2025-11-03,"Authoritarian governments of all stripes love — and need — to keep a tight leash on their citizens. Ten years ago, the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China was kinda comfortable with allowing its citizens to engage in capitalism and explore what the free market had to offer — a lot of Western businesses set up shop in the nation's major cities. 
The West became famished for fast fashion and reasonably priced brands like HiSense, TCL, and Oppo. When I visited China in 2017, the government was cracking down on access to news from outside of Chinese borders. It was a friendly, welcoming place. If you're dumb enough to turn down Chinese barbecue, you could buy Kentucky Fried Chicken or a drink from Starbucks. I was able to buy a cable I needed at an Apple Store in Qingdao. 
A lot has changed since then. At the same time that Xi Jinping has been consolidating power and building up the country's military, the landscape for Chinese business owners has shifted. Businesses that were freed from state ownership have been yoinked back into the country's oversight once again. Trade relations with other nations have been tidied up and, where little government interference once existed, there's now a giant knot of red gaffer's tape. 
Even China's criminal enterprises were touched by this sea change. It's more challenging to find a government official who'll look the other way, of late. The risk of being caught by the National Supervisory Commission is too high. And it's whispered that what crime is allowed to flourish, such as fentanyl created outside of approved channels, needs to give a taste of their profits to the NPC. No matter how much is paid, selling illicit goods to people inside the country, if it's detrimental to the control and smooth operation of Chinese society, is crushed with an iron fist. For those who make their living in the dark, it's much more lucrative—and much safer—to sell their wares outside of the country. That goes for drugs, weapons, counterfeit luxury items, and, surprisingly, digital piracy.
Despite their unique, vibrant culture, the Chinese people are pretty horny for Western media content. For a while, it was almost as easy to find Handi-Cam captured copies of American films and software as it was in Mexico. There's zero tolerance for it now. You'd think that the risk would drive the street price for these goods up, but just like officials now shunning brown paper envelopes stuffed with cash, the risk of being caught is giving crooks the no feeling.
So, just like their drug-making cousins, content pirates have started selling their goods, almost exclusively, outside of the country. The problem is bad enough that the International Intellectual Property Alliance felt the need to moan about it in a letter to the Chinese government:
Unfortunately, market access restrictions remain the primary driver behind persistent, evolving, and rampant piracy in China. While significant piracy in China's domestic market remains an enduring challenge, the exporting of pirated content, piracy services, and piracy devices (PDs) from China to foreign markets is a growing and equally troubling global trend. Longstanding market access concerns, including the inability for foreign rights holders to freely engage in distribution of video-on-demand (VOD) services or online video games, timing and deterrence concerns in court cases, and remaining legislative shortcomings, all hamper rights holders' ability to distribute and effectively protect their copyright content, including holding back the Chinesecreative marketplace from reaching its full potential.
It's a polite way of saying ""you're stealing our shit and making things that let people steal our shit."" If you've seen the signs and online ads for Android-powered IPTV/VOD boxes (or own one), you know what the IIPA is talking about. The same applies to IPTV services, which can be set up and viewed using a streaming stick or on a laptop.
With the promise that streaming content would cost a hell of a lot less than a cable subscription well behind us, the demand for this hardware and the services associated with it is skyrocketing. At a time when folks are being forced to choose between paying their bills or buying food, the comfort that such illicit content — a respite from the stress of living in this rabid era — is hard to calculate. Unless you're counting it in the amount of Chinese yuan renminbi it generates, that is.

14,2025-11-03,"China waged a campaign of harassment and intimidation directed at a UK university to get it to shut down sensitive research into alleged human rights abuses, documents seen by the BBC show.
Sheffield Hallam University staff in China were threatened by individuals described by them as being from China's National Security Service who demanded the research being  done in Sheffield be halted.
And access to the university's websites from China was blocked, impeding its ability to recruit Chinese students, in a campaign of threats and intimidation lasting more than two years.
In an internal email from July 2024, university officials said ""attempting to retain the business in China and publication of the research are now untenable bedfellows"".
When the UK government learned of the case, the then Foreign Secretary David Lammy issued a warning to his Chinese counterpart that it would not tolerate attempts to suppress academic freedoms at UK universities, the BBC understands.
The issue was also raised with China's most senior education minister.
China was seeking to halt research by Laura Murphy, professor of human rights and contemporary slavery at Sheffield Hallam, into allegations Uyghur Muslims in the north-western region of Xinjiang were subject to forced labour.
China has faced accusations – always firmly denied – that it has committed crimes against humanity and possibly genocide against the Uyghur population.
In late 2024, following pressure from the Chinese state and a separate defamation law suit against the university, Sheffield Hallam decided not to publish a final piece of research by Prof Murphy and her team into forced labour.
And in early 2025, university administrators told her that she could ""not continue with her research into supply chains and forced labour in China"".
She initiated legal action against the university for failing in its duty to protect her academic freedom and she submitted a ""subject access request"" demanding Sheffield Hallam hand over any relevant internal documents.
The documents she obtained showed the university ""had negotiated directly with a foreign intelligence service to trade my academic freedom for access to the Chinese student market,"" she told the BBC.
She added: ""I'd never seen anything quite so patently explicit about the extent to which a university would go to ensure that they have Chinese student income.""
Sheffield Hallam has now apologised to Prof Murphy and said she can resume her work.
A spokesperson said ""the university's decision to not continue with Professor Laura Murphy's research was taken based on our understanding of a complex set of circumstances at the time, including being unable to secure the necessary professional indemnity insurance"".
They said the university wished to ""make clear our commitment to supporting her research and to securing and promoting freedom of speech and academic freedom within the law"".
But the general secretary of the University and College Union, Jo Grady, said ""it is incredibly worrying that Sheffield Hallam appears to have attempted to silence its own professor on behalf of a foreign government"".
She added: ""Given the censorship Hallam has seemingly engaged in, it now needs to set out how it will ensure its academics will be supported to research freely and protected from overreach by foreign powers.""
A government spokesperson told the BBC ""any attempt by a foreign state to intimidate, harass or harm individuals in the UK will not be tolerated, and the government has made this clear to Beijing after learning of this case"". 
It all began so differently.
When, in 2021, Prof Murphy published a major report into Uhygur forced labour in the solar panel industry, the director of the Helena Kennedy Centre (HKC), the department in which her unit was based, wrote to congratulate her.
""This is an exceptional moment in the history of the HKC... we are all exceptionally proud of this body of work which rightly shines light on the blatant abuse of Uyghur tights (sic) in China.. Well done Laura!""
Over the following months her unit published four reports, including into car parts and cotton for clothing, trying to trace supply chains and highlight where goods reaching western consumers may have been produced with inputs made with forced labour in Xinjiang.
China denies such practices occur.
The Chinese Embassy in London told the BBC ""the Helena Kennedy Centre at the Sheffield Hallam University has released multiple fake reports on Xinjiang that are seriously flawed"".
""It has been revealed that some authors of these reports received funding from certain US agencies,"" the Embassy added.
Prof Murphy told the BBC she has received funding over the course of her career from the US National Endowment for Humanities for work on slave narratives, the US Department of Justice for work on human trafficking in New Orleans, and more recently from USAID, the US State Department and the UK Foreign Office for her work on China.
The Chinese Embassy said the allegations of ""forced labor"" in her reports ""cannot withstand basic fact-check"".
""While presenting itself as an academic body, the Centre has in practice acted as a vehicle for politicised and disinformation-driven narratives deployed by anti-China forces,"" the embassy added.
The university realised it was coming in for criticism from China as far back as 2022.
An internal university email from August of that year, seen by the BBC, said China's foreign ministry had issued a statement ""denouncing us as being in the 'disreputable vanguard of anti-China rhetoric'"".
The email said the university had admitted 500 Chinese students in 2018, but numbers had collapsed in the pandemic and had not bounced back like it had in other markets. 
It expressed concern that the Chinese government's criticisms could result in a ""boycott"" by prospective students and recruitment agents. 
In total, the documents show Sheffield had earned £3.8m in 2021/22 from China and Hong Kong.
Later in August 2022 the university's English language testing website used by Chinese students to take tests before coming to Sheffield had been ""shut down in China temporarily"".
Over the next two years the pressure escalated dramatically leading university officials to write in an email in May 2024 that ""the continuation of the university's scholarly activity with and in China and Hong Kong has been placed at risk because of the research activities, led by Professor Laura Murphy, in relation to alleged persecution of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, China"".
An internal ""risk summary,"" dated 9 December 2024, detailed what had happened.
In August 2022, China had blocked access to the university's websites. All email communication from and to the university was disabled.
It meant students in China due to study at Sheffield Hallam were unable to access the enrolment website, arrange their welcome or airport pick up in the UK, or course information.
The university said this had ""undoubtedly had a negative impact on recruitment"" in 23/24, with ""anticipated further decline in 24/25"".
And, in 2024, the intimidation began.
""Things in Beijing have kicked off,"" an internal email from 18 April 2024 said.
The risk summary detailed that ""three officers of the National Security Service"" visited Sheffield Hallam's office in China.
A local staff member was ""questioned for two hours regarding the HKC research and future publications. 
""The tone was threatening and message to cease the research activity was made clear.""
At another visit, security officers said the internet issues were because the Uyghur research was available on the university website.
Finally, in September 2024, the document states ""a decision by the university not to publish a final phase of the research on forced labour in China was communicated to the National Security Service .. immediately relations improved and the threat to staff wellbeing appears to be removed"".
Sheffield Hallam says these internal communications need to be seen in context and do not represent university policy.
Complicating things for Sheffield Hallam had been a report by its Forced Labour Lab published December 2023 into clothing supply chains connected to Xinjiang.
Smart Shirts Ltd, a Hong Kong supplier of garments with customers in the UK, brought a claim for libel, alleging it had been defamed as its name was included.
A preliminary ruling at the High Court in London in December 2024 found that report had been ""defamatory"".
A full trial in that case is yet to take place at which Sheffield Hallam will be able to put forward its defence to the company's claim, but the university was told by its insurers that ""any defamation, libel or slander"" claims linked to its entire Social and Economic Research Institute were no longer covered.
Professor Murphy had, meanwhile, built an international profile.
Her work had been cited in the UK parliament, in Canada and in Australia. She had taken a career break in late 2023 to work for the US Department of Homeland Security, helping it with the implementation of their Uyghur Forced Labour Prevention Act.
In her absence, and amid the pressure from China and the lawsuit, Sheffield Hallam decided her unit would close in early 2025.
""Despite significant offers of continued funding we have decided it is in our best interests to terminate the research,"" an email of August 2024 said.
It added that by not publishing the final report under the university's auspices it hoped ""we can minimise the possibility of any further scrutiny of our operations .. thereby attending to related duty of care issues"".
But failing to publish the report was a breach of the terms agreed with the external groups who had agreed to fund the research.
So the university decided to close the unit and not use any outstanding funds.
Sheffield Hallam said it was normal practice for research groups to stand down at the end of an external contract.
When Prof Murphy returned from her career break in early 2025, the university told her of its ""decision not to continue with her research into supply chains and forced labour in China due to .. the corporate insurance position .. and our duty of care to colleagues working in both China and the UK"".
Any other work or public engagements outside the university would also have to be checked for ""conflict of interest"".
Seeking to continue her work, Prof Murphy began her legal action and made a subject access request to the university requiring it to turn over relevant internal documents.
""What about the duty of care to me and the duty of care to the rest of my research team?,"" Prof Murphy told the BBC.
""They laid off my entire research team. Sent them away. They sent back all of our research funding, and they shuttered the entire programme without regard for the people who worked with us on that project, so many of them Uyghur folks.""
She added: ""As long as the university system in the UK is so wildly underfunded as it is now, universities will be vulnerable to attacks like this.""
After receiving her apology from the university and a pledge to protect her academic freedom, she is not currently pursuing her legal action.  
Her case had been built on the Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Act 2023, which places on universities a duty to promote freedom of speech and academic freedom for their staff.
Her solicitors, Leigh Day, had argued that a lack of insurance  and ""unspecified"" concerns about staff safety do not provide universities carte blanche to restrict freedoms.
The law firm believes refusing to authorise any research on a particular country would be unlawful.
Sheffield Hallam's spokesperson said: ""For the avoidance of doubt, the decision was not based on commercial interests in China.
""Regardless, China is not a significant international student market for the university.""
The university only enrolled 73 students from China in 2024/25.
The Chinese Embassy said ""there are over 200,000 Chinese students in the UK, making China the largest source of international students in the UK,""  adding ""educational cooperation has become a driving force in bilateral ties"".
Baroness Helena Kennedy KC, patron of the centre that bears her name, said UK universities were ""vulnerable"" to pressure from China because ""bringing in Chinese students is one of the ways of dealing with the financial crises that universities are facing"".
""If we see limitations being made on the kind of research that goes on in these universities, I think we should be alarmed,"" added the Labour peer, who has herself been sanctioned by China for speaking out about issues related to Xinjiang.

Don't worry, you can continue to ask ChatGPT all your burning health questions.
A series of news articles and X posts on Monday morning, including one post by the prediction market Kalshi, suggested that OpenAI's ChatGPT would no longer offer health advice.
That's not entirely accurate. OpenAI can still give you medical information — it just can't pretend to be your doctor.
""This is not a new change to our terms. ChatGPT has never been a substitute for professional legal or medical advice, but it will continue to be a great resource to help people understand legal and health information,"" an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement to Business Insider.
Kalshi deleted its X post following the publication of this article.
The posts draw on OpenAI's usage policies, which were updated on October 29 to include some new language around medical guidance. The new policies say users can't look to OpenAI's services for ""provision of tailored advice that requires a license, such as legal or medical advice, without appropriate involvement by a licensed professional.""
ChatGPT has exploded in popularity among users seeking health information. People are turning to the chatbot to prepare for their doctor's visits, break down complex medical jargon, and get a second opinion on their symptoms. About 1 in 6 people use ChatGPT for health advice at least once a month, according to a KFF 2024 survey.
The idea that ChatGPT will no longer provide health advice is catching users off guard. In a reply to Kalshi's X post that had over 2,100 likes by early Monday afternoon, one user said if ChatGPT can't provide health advice, ""then I have no use for it anymore lol.""
Karan Singhal, who leads OpenAI's health AI research team, called the claims in Kalshi's X post ""not true"" in his own X post Monday afternoon, clarifying that ""model behavior remains unchanged.""
""ChatGPT has never been a substitute for professional advice, but it will continue to be a great resource to help people understand legal and health information,"" he wrote.
It's true that ChatGPT cannot diagnose you or provide in-depth medical guidance that's specific to you.
For example, I told ChatGPT I had a head cold (for demonstration purposes only) and asked what I should do to feel better.
ChatGPT didn't try to diagnose me or prescribe specific medications, like a doctor might. But it did give me a list of recommendations on how I could feel better. Among them: I could drink tea, turn on a humidifier, and take over-the-counter medicines like acetaminophen if I started running a fever.
Personalized, specialized recommendations are what legally separate ""medical advice"" from ""medical information."" Providing general health information doesn't require a medical license. That's how journalists, founders, and influencers are allowed to share health information and wellness advice online without a medical degree.
It's the same premise as a personal finance TikToker sharing their top stock picks but stipulating that it's ""not investment advice.""
OpenAI's updated usage policies help draw a clearer line to limit the AI giant's liability. As more users turn to ChatGPT for medical advice, some cases are emerging of users taking that advice with disastrous results.
One man developed a rare psychiatric condition after ChatGPT suggested he could substitute his salt intake with sodium bromide, which is toxic to humans, according to an August article published in the Annals of Internal Medicine. OpenAI has also implemented stricter mental health guardrails after its models ""fell short in recognizing signs of delusion or emotional dependency,"" the company said in August.
ChatGPT can't replace a clinician, especially for more serious conditions where diagnosis or professional-level judgment is required. OpenAI's usage policies now state that its products can't be used for ""automation of high-stakes decisions in sensitive areas without human review,"" including in medicine.
After asking ChatGPT what I should do about my head cold, I started a new thread. ""I can't move the right side of my face. What should I do?"" I asked.
ChatGPT recognized the severity of the situation and immediately recommended I call 911. While the chatbot suggested the immobility could be the result of a stroke or a condition like Bell's palsy, it said I should consult a medical professional either way.
The updated usage policies could have implications for OpenAI's push into healthcare, just a few months after the company hired new leaders for its consumer and enterprise healthcare projects. If OpenAI can't provide tailored medical advice, the company could be limited in its ability to create personalized health products for consumers.
But for the average user, you can still ask ChatGPT medical questions just as you might ask Doctor Google. Just don't use the chatbot to replace your real doctor.

President Donald Trump desperately tried to pivot the conversation away from his tanking economy in an interview with 60 Minutes Sunday. When probed by Norah O’Donnell about grocery prices, Trump first flailed, before outright lying.
When the president brought up the stock market, O’Donnell pointed out that many Americans may not feel the effects of market growth in their wallets: “When the stock market is doing well, that doesn’t affect everybody. Not everybody is invested in the stock market—”
“It does,” insisted Trump. “Oh it does, it does.”
O’Donnell pushed ahead, observing, “Grocery prices are up.”
Trump ignored her, choosing to instead over-exaggerate the growth of 401(k) retirement savings accounts. O’Donnell, not taking the bait, tried again to get the president to answer her question: “But for people that don’t have 401(k)s, who are not invested in the stock market—they’ve seen their grocery prices go up.”
“No, you’re wrong.” Trump responded. “They went up under Biden, right now they’re going down. Other than beef, which we’re working on.”
O'DONNELL: Grocery prices are upTRUMP: No, you’re wrong pic.twitter.com/FDf9AgiUXz
In reality, grocery prices are not down—they’re up. Grocery prices are 2.7 percent higher than they were last September and 1.4 percent higher than January, when Trump triumphantly returned to office. They’re also still on the rise, according to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics last Friday. Overall, grocery prices have increased almost 30 percent in the last five years.
Though this is far from the first time that Trump has lied on camera, pretending that grocery prices are down is particularly egregious. The president campaigned on lowering prices, and has lied repeatedly about the fact that his nonsensical tariffs and cruel mass deportation campaign—which targets many of the people who grow and harvest our food—have hurt consumers.
Meanwhile, Trump is gilding the Oval Office and building a ballroom. At least he’s not out of touch!

Donald Trump is using an imaginary list of “wars” he’s solved to silence questions about his untenable relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The president refused to answer questions about why Putin was dragging his feet on ending Russia’s war on Ukraine during a sit-down interview with 60 Minutes Sunday. Instead, Trump pulled a propaganda-packed sheet of paper out of his jacket pocket to illustrate just how successful he thinks he’s been at solving international crises.
“So why won’t Putin end this war?” asked host Norah O’Donnell.
“But, Nora, that was Joe Biden’s war, not my war. I inherited that stupid war,” Trump responded, 11 months into his own presidency.
“But I brought just a little list of, look at this, wars,” Trump said.
Trump has touted himself for months as a great peacemaker, pushing a narrative that he has—so far—solved eight foreign conflicts. He has claimed responsibility for inventing peace between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of Rwanda, between Cambodia and Thailand, between Israel and Iran, between India and Pakistan, between Serbia and Kosovo, between Egypt and Ethiopia, between Armenia and Azerbaijan (although he has previously forgotten and said Albania instead of Armenia), between Israel and Gaza, and for “doing the Abraham Accords.”
But as Zeteo’s Mehdi Hasan pointed out in September, practically all of Trump’s war-solving braggadocio is “demonstrably untrue” to the extent that several of the listed examples were never even at war.
“And you have branded yourself the peace president,” O’Donnell continued.
“Well I think I did pretty good, I solved eight of the nine wars I solved, you know how I solved them? I said, in many cases, in 60 percent, if you don’t stop fighting I’m putting tariffs on both of your countries and you’re not going to be able to do business in the United States,” Trump said.
“So why isn’t that working with Putin?” pressed O’Donnell.
“Uh, it is working with Putin, I think,” Trump said.
Trump has conceded quite a bit to the Russian dictator, to no avail. This summer, Trump literally rolled out the red carpet for Putin in Alaska, marking Putin’s first return to U.S. soil in more than a decade. After the theatrics were over, the two world leaders still failed to reach a consensus on how to end the bloodshed, with Trump losing his cool while Putin demanded that Ukraine cede more territory to Russia.
More than 13,300 civilians have been killed and 31,700 injured in Ukraine since Russia invaded in February 2022, according to a United Nations report from June.

CBS’s 60 Minutes aired an exclusive interview with Donald Trump on Sunday, but the news magazine cut out a contentious portion regarding the president’s pardon of a cryptocurrency billionaire.
Trump’s televised interview was only 28 minutes long, with CBS also releasing a 73-minute extended cut online. But neither video contained Trump’s full answer after interviewer Norah O’Donnell asked the president about people he pardoned, specifically Changpeng Zhao, the co-founder and former CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Binance.
“I don’t know who he is,” Trump said about Zhao, despite the pardon coming just last month. “I know he got a four-month sentence or something like that, and I heard it was a Biden witch hunt.”
O’Donnell pointed out that the Trump family had formed a cryptocurrency business with the Witkoff family, World Liberty Financial, and that after being pardoned, Binance struck a $2 billion deal with the Trump’s business. O’Donnell then asked Trump if he was “concerned about the appearance of corruption.”
Trump’s full response was missing from video posted online but was in CBS’s published transcript.
“I can’t say, because—I can’t say—I’m not concerned. I don’t—I’d rather not have you ask the question. But I let you ask it. You just came to me and you said, ‘Can I ask another question?’ And I said, yeah. This is the question …” Trump replied, going on to dodge the question and touting cryptocurrency. 
“We’re No. 1 in crypto in the whole world,” Trump said. “Other people wanna be. They’re fighting like hell to be. But we’re No. 1 in crypto because I’m the president.… We are No. 1 in crypto, and that’s the only thing I care about. I don’t want China or anybody else to take it away. It’s a massive industry,” Trump said.
It’s telling that the video of this portion of the interview is nowhere to be found online, especially considering that CBS’s parent company, Paramount, reached a $16 million settlement with Trump in July over a frivolous lawsuit where Trump claimed an interview with his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, was deceptively edited. There’s also the right-wing shift the company has taken following Trump allies Larry and David Ellison’s takeover of Paramount.
Trump even hinted as much in another portion of the interview that was conveniently left out of posted or televised video, saying, “And actually 60 Minutes paid me a lotta money. And you don’t have to put this on, because I don’t wanna embarrass you.”
“But 60 Minutes was forced to pay me—a lot of money because they took [Harris’s] answer out that was so bad, it was election-changing, two nights before the election. And they put a new answer in. And they paid me a lot of money for that. You can’t have fake news. You’ve gotta have legit news. And I think that it’s happening.”

The Heritage Foundation is facing a staff rebellion over its president, Kevin Roberts, expressing support of Tucker Carlson following his softball interview with neo-Nazi Nick Fuentes.
After Carlson posted his interview online on Monday, many conservatives urged the foundation to distance itself from the conservative commentator due to Fuentes’s racist and antisemitic views. Fuentes is the founder of the Groypers, a group of internet trolls that praises Hitler as well as white and Christian nationalism.
Instead, Roberts released a video on X Thursday in support of Carlson and Fuentes, calling the former “a close friend of the Heritage Foundation” and saying that “canceling” Fuentes is not the solution, even though he personally abhors what he says. In response, Heritage staff members—including Heritage research fellow Preston Brashers and Richard Stern, the director of Heritage’s economic policy institute and federal budget center—have started criticizing Roberts on social media.
At least a handful of Heritage staffers, including Jason Bedrick, Jay Greene, and John Peluso, also retweeted Brashers’s post. Other conservatives, including Senator Ted Cruz and influencer Bethany Mandel, have also criticized Roberts. The backlash led to Roberts making a follow-up post on Friday condemning Fuentes’s views but reiterating his view “that the best way to fight antisemitic ideas was to challenge them head on.”  
“Our task is to confront and challenge those poisonous ideas at every turn to prevent them from taking America to a very dark place. Join us—not to cancel—but to guide, challenge, and strengthen the conversation, and be confident as I am that our best ideas at the heart of western civilization will prevail,” Roberts’s post read.  
However, Roberts’s continued support of Carlson’s interview of Fuentes, which failed to challenge the neo-Nazi, exemplifies how today’s conservatives seem to be normalizing such views. Giving people like Fuentes a platform in conservative media creates the impression that their point of view deserves to be heard, and gives them a path to become part of the MAGA movement and the Republican Party. 
Earlier this month, the leak of a group chat full of Young Republicans supporting racist and Nazi beliefs caused a similar divided reaction from Republicans in which some, including Vice President JD Vance, defended the participants. Today, it seems having Nazi views is not a dealbreaker for mainstream conservatism. 

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth offered a baffling defense Friday for President Donald Trump’s directive to resume nuclear testing. 
Following a meeting with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations’ Secretary-General Kao Kim Hourn, Hegseth said his agency would work with the U.S. Department of Energy on just how they would carry out nuclear weapons testing for the first time in 30 years. 
“We need to have a credible nuclear deterrent, that is the baseline of our deterrence. And so having understanding, and resuming testing is a pretty responsible—very responsible way to do that. I think it makes nuclear conflict less likely, if you know what you have and make sure it operates properly,” Hegseth said.
But experts suggest that resuming nuclear testing would shatter global norms, deprioritize disarmament, and grant nations license to test their own weapons.
Arizona Democratic Senator Mark Kelly slammed Trump’s explosive directive. “If we did a test and then China decided, ‘OK, I’m going to start testing.’ They’ll start testing their nuclear weapons, then their strategic forces capability gets much better,” the former naval aviator said Thursday. “We have zero to gain. This would be a gift to China.”
Paul Dean, vice president for policy at the Nuclear Threat Initiative, told Politico that the U.S. could certify its stockpile without expensive weapons testing (each test would cost $140 million). Dean added that it was a risky move “that can be easily misconstrued, generate arms race pressure and rapidly evolve into a crisis.”
Earlier this week, Beth Sanner, former deputy director of national intelligence, told CNN that resuming nuclear testing was a “bad idea” that would benefit other countries more than it would benefit the U.S. Already, Russia has indicated that if other nations resumed nuclear testing, Moscow would follow suit. 

New York City votes Tuesday for its next mayor, but Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer still has to make a decision on who he’ll pick on his ballot.
The Democratic leader ran away from the press Friday when asked who he intended to cast his ballot for in the upcoming election.
“[Zohran] Mamdani, are you going to vote for him?” asked CNN’s Manu Raju.
“The bottom line is very simple. I have a good relationship with him, and we’re continuing to talk,” said Schumer.
“But the vote is on Tuesday. What are you going to do?” pressed Raju.
But Schumer had already turned his back and walked out of the room.
After a tight Democratic primary (and stunning upset victory) this summer, Mamdani has gained citywide appeal. The Ugandan-born New Yorker is currently leading the mayoral race by double digits, according to three new polls out this week. 
An Emerson College poll published Thursday put Mamdani at 50 percent favorability with likely voters. Ex–New York Governor Andrew Cuomo trailed behind at 25 percent, while the poll estimated that Republican mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa would attract 21 percent. Just 5 percent of voters remained undecided, according to the Emerson College poll.
Mamdani’s candidacy has proven a pivotal turning point for the Democratic Party, separating out the politicians with a dream for the future against those without one. Ultimately, Schumer’s abstention only serves as yet another illustration of how detached Democratic leadership has become from the desires of their base, who apparently—per New York’s anticipated election results—crave drastic change.
Mamdani’s campaign has already collected support from the likes of Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and New York Governor Kathy Hochul.
Like Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries waited until the last minute to support the Democratic Socialist. Jeffries extended his backing just last week, too late to make any meaningful difference in the race’s outcome.

As Americans braced Friday for SNAP benefits to expire, President Donald Trump couldn’t stop bragging about his extravagant new bathroom.
With less than 24 hours left to fund essential food resources 42 million Americans rely on, Trump was hard at work sharing pictures on Truth Social of the pristine white marble facility adorned with gaudy golden hardware. In a separate post, Trump explained that they were photographs of the refurbished bathroom in the Lincoln Bedroom. 
“Highly polished, Statuary marble!” he wrote. (In September, Trump reportedly took an hour to give Republican lawmakers from Florida a tour, where he showed off the new marble tiles he’d selected for the floors.)
But Trump wasn’t done there. With the deadline to ensure funding fast approaching, he turned his attention to his renovations at the Kennedy Center. 
“It is really looking good!” he wrote in another post on Truth Social, touting fixes to the apparently corroded columns, rebuilt stages, fresh carpets, as well as “new seats, new chairs.”
“It is happening faster than anticipated, one of my trademarks,” Trump wrote. “My people are doing a really great job! We are bringing this building back to life. It was dead as a doornail, but it will soon be beautiful again!”
But it seems that speed is only a virtue when it comes to construction—the president has allowed the government shutdown to stretch on for 31 days, making it the second-longest in history. 
A federal judge in Rhode Island issued a temporary order requiring the government to use contingency funds to pay for SNAP benefits as the shutdown continues. But just hours earlier, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins wouldn’t commit to releasing SNAP funds if ordered to do so.

Two federal judges have ordered the Trump administration to use contingency funds to pay out SNAP funds while the government is shut down. 
U.S. District Judges John J. McConnell in Rhode Island and Indira Talwani in Massachusetts each ruled Friday that the government had to keep funding the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, either partially or in full for November. Prior to news of the ruling, the U.S. Department of Agriculture was planning to freeze payments for food stamps Saturday. 
White House officials had refused to fund SNAP from a $5 billion contingency fund that existed precisely to keep funding the program in the event of something like this. In response, 25 states and the District of Columbia sued the federal government in federal court to keep the program running, alleging that the USDA had “both the authority and legal duty” to do so.
Both Talwani and McConnell asked for updates from the government by Monday. In his ruling, McConnell ruled that the previous work requirement waivers must stay intact, reversing the USDA’s decision during the shutdown to terminate waivers exempting older adults, veterans, and others from work requirements. 
Talwani called the government’s suspension of SNAP unlawful, writing in her ruling that “Defendants’ suspension of SNAP payments was based on the erroneous conclusion that the Contingency Funds could not be used to ensure continuation of SNAP payments. This court has now clarified that Defendants are required to use those Contingency Funds as necessary for the SNAP program.”
The Trump administration will undoubtedly appeal, possibly all the way to the Supreme Court. But for now, millions of people across the country will not have to make hard choices about how to feed themselves and their families. Several states that had already declared emergencies to tackle the impending crisis will have at least some temporary relief. 
This story has been updated.

One Republican representative is angry that Donald Trump’s redistricting war has put his congressional seat in danger. 
California Representative Kevin Kiley criticized the GOP in an interview with The New York Times’ podcast The Daily Friday, saying that his party’s attempt to grab more seats in the House of Representatives and keep control of Congress is “incredibly destabilizing.” 
“I said from the moment this was on my radar that it shouldn’t be happening anywhere. I’m against it in Texas, I’m against it in California. It’s pure political opportunism,” Kiley said. 
If California Governor Gavin Newsom is successful in his retaliation, Kiley could be squeezed out of Congress, as California would gain five new Democratic seats. The congressman tried to head off the redistricting tit-for-tat back in August by introducing a bill to prevent congressional districts from being redrawn in the middle of a decade, as opposed to the customary end of a decade following the national census. 
But Republican leadership didn’t support his idea and went on with their gerrymandering efforts across the country, including in places like Ohio, Missouri, Utah, and Indiana. This has prompted Democratic redistricting efforts in states besides California such as Maryland, New York, and even purple Virginia, and drawn the ire of other vulnerable Republicans in addition to Kiley. Who knows what Congress is going to look like when the dust clears?

The U.N. human rights chief has taken the unprecedented step of condemning America’s military strikes on boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, accusing the U.S. of violating international law.
The Trump administration has committed 14 known strikes on small boats in the two regions over the last two months, killing at least 61 people. 
Volker Türk, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, issued the critique—the first of its kind—Friday, calling for a “prompt, independent, and transparent” investigation into the strikes.
 “These attacks and their mounting human cost are unacceptable,” Türk said, as relayed by spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani. “The U.S. must halt such attacks and take all measures necessary to prevent the extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats.”
Shamdasani added that Türk believed “airstrikes by the United States of America on boats in the Caribbean and in the Pacific violate international human rights law.”
The White House has insisted the violence is justified, broadly accusing the boats of trafficking narcotics to the U.S. from Venezuela and Colombia, though U.S. lawmakers have been more than skeptical—particularly since several of the boats were thousands of miles away in international waters, and since the attacks were conducted without prior investigations or interdiction. On Thursday, Democratic Representative Sara Jacobs revealed Pentagon officials weren’t even concerned with identifying the people on the boats before attacking.
Trump has blamed the attacks on Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, who has remained atop the country’s government despite Trump’s forceful attempts in 2019 to install then–opposition leader Juan Guaido.
Last week, the Pentagon announced it would deploy the world’s largest warship—the USS Gerald R. Ford—to Latin America in an effort to ramp up the military firepower available for fighting the small watercraft.
But the escalation has only further strained America’s relationship with its Latin American neighbors. In an address to his country late last week, Maduro accused the U.S. of fabricating “a new eternal war.”"

Balancer, which is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol focused on automated market making (AMM), was exploited early Monday morning in an attack that may have led to $120 million or more in losses for its users.
The specific details of how the attack was pulled off are still unclear at this time. According to an early analysis published on the Blocksec Phalcon X account, the exploit was âhighly sophisticatedâ and involved manipulating prices within the protocol that allowed the attacker to profit. On the other hand, Cyvers CEO Deddy Lavid told Bloomberg that the attacker may have been able to manipulate balances directly via an exploit involving the control mechanisms of the protocol.
Weâre aware of a potential exploit impacting Balancer v2 pools.
Our engineering and security teams are investigating with high priority.
Weâll share verified updates and next steps as soon as we have more information.
— Balancer (@Balancer) November 3, 2025

The latest update from Balancer indicates they are currently working with leading security researchers to better understand exactly what happened and will eventually provide a full post-mortem report. In addition to Balancer, other projects that were based on forks of that particular DeFi protocolâs smart contracts were also affected.
While hacks and thefts in the world of DeFi and crypto more generally are not at all uncommon, the attack on Balancer is particularly troubling due to the high degree of trust that had been built around the protocol. Balancer has existed since 2020, and itâs also received many security audits by highly-trusted firms over the years, including from the likes of OpenZeppelin and Trail of Bits. These are the sorts of firms that have also given their stamp of approval to other highly reputable and trusted DeFi protocols.
Notably, the exploit occurred on Balancer v2, which launched in 2021 and was thought to be better reviewed and more trustworthy than the more recent Balancer v3 implementation due to its existence in the wild for much longer.
Ethereum developer Lefteris Karapetsas noted on X that the main takeaway from this event is not the actual theft, but rather the collapse of trust in DeFi that will come with it. âA protocol live since 2020, audited and widely used, can still suffer a near-total TVL loss,â wrote Karapetsas. âThatâs a red flag for anyone thinking DeFi is âstable.â No serious capital allocates into systems that fragile.â
Hasu, who is a strategic advisor to Lido and the strategy lead at Flashbots, shared a similar sentiment, posting, âBalancer v2 launched in 2021 and is one of the most looked at and forked smart contracts since. It’s very scary. Every time such an old contract can be exploited, it (rightfully) sets Defi adoption back by 6-12 months.â
Not to be dramatic, but the Balancer exploit is a nightmare scenario.
Balancer is a DeFi OG operating since 2020, among the top 3 most battle-tested DApps, and the exploit happened in Balancer V2 vaults (audited by multiple top firms that also audited most of DeFi).

At least one blockchain, Berachain, has been temporarily shut down in response to the attack. In fact, the Berachain network will undergo a hard fork in an attempt to roll back the effects of this exploit on its chain, according to the Berachain X account. This is reminiscent of the situation from two weeks ago, when the lack of real decentralization in crypto was exposed by the downtime incurred at Amazon Web Services (AWS).
According to Coinbase Director Conor Grogan, the Balancer exploiter funded the attack on Balancer with ETH that was previously held in Tornado Cash, which is a mixing protocol on Ethereum intended to separate funds from their transaction history.
Unless the exploiter transfers funds into stablecoins, which are more easily controlled and subject to blacklisting, or deposits crypto onto a centralized exchange, recovery of funds may be difficult. That said, there have been past situations where DeFi protocol exploiters have returned partial funds or the protocol itself was effectively bailed out. At this point, itâs simply too early to tell what will happen in this specific incident.
For now, the effects of this latest exploit on the crypto world may involve questioning whether DeFi protocols can be trusted and are worth the costs of decentralization more generally, especially when it comes to financial activities involving tokens issued by entities that are inherently centralized anyway.

Stride Inc. (NYSE: LRN) has experienced a decline of nearly half its market value within days after it released its most recent quarterly results—an incredible drop for a company that actually surpassed earnings expectations. The online education company disclosed an adjusted EPS of $1.52, an increase from $1.26 a year earlier, along with revenue of $620.9 million, marking an almost 13% year-over-year growth, propelled by robust expansion in its Career Learning segment. However, investors were unsettled when Stride’s leadership forecasted full-year revenue between $2.48 billion and $2.55 billion, significantly lower than Wall Street’s anticipated figure of approximately $2.67 billion. The company also recognized operational missteps related to the rollout of new technologies, which it stated may have led to a loss of 10,000–15,000 student enrollments—a critical shortfall for a business reliant on scale and retention. Also see: Stride Stock Drops 54% In A Day, Time To Buy The Stock?
Before we explore the specifics, if you are looking for a profitable alternative with reduced volatility compared to holding an individual stock or cryptocurrency like ETH or BTC, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has delivered returns that have surpassed 105% since its inception. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; they provided a smoother investment experience, as illustrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
This revised guidance suggests revenue growth is set to decline from approximately 18% last year down to just 9–10% this year—a significant slowdown that has caused distress among growth investors. Despite an 11% increase in overall enrollment and Career Learning continuing to grow at more than 30%, the market is now skeptical about Stride’s ability to maintain profitability if growth momentum wanes. Prior improvements in margins were promising—adjusted operating income surged by 59% last year and EBITDA climbed by 46%—but those advancements could diminish if student retention and technology costs continue to weigh heavily.
At the present rate, Stride is trading at around 12–13× forward earnings, which is significantly lower than peers like Chegg or Coursera, who command valuations greater than 20×. This low valuation reflects doubt—but it also indicates opportunity. If management can stabilize enrollments and achieve its long-term goal of 10% annual revenue growth and 20% profit growth, the current downturn may eventually be perceived as capitulation rather than a fundamental decline. For the time being, however, investors will need to observe clear signs of execution before assuming that the bottom has been reached.
Investing in a single stock or token without thorough analysis may involve risks. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a blend of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to generate substantial returns for investors. What’s the reason for that? The quarterly rebalanced collection of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offered an effective strategy to capitalize on favorable market conditions while minimizing losses during downturns, as explained in RV Portfolio performance metrics."

Bitcoin has hit bottom. Now it can only go up. 
That’s according to analysts David Brickell and Chris Mills. In their Connecting the Dots newsletter on Sunday, they said that in “this past week, we believe we’ve seen the ‘peak’ in US liquidity conditions tightening.”
The London Crypto Club analysts see the moment as “marking a local bottom,” and predict that a surge in liquidity over the coming weeks will see Bitcoin “reconnect to the broader risk picture” and “retest record highs.”
The bullish call comes as Bitcoin’s price dropped about 3% on Monday morning, trading at just over $107,000. The dip comes on the back of traders on Bitcoin exchange-traded funds selling $800 million worth of their assets last week, DefiLlama data shows. 
But with $3.4 billion in ETF inflows still logged in October, Brickell and Mills expect the world’s largest crypto to retest record highs in the coming months.
Short-term uncertainty around Federal Reserve policy weighs on the market, Brickell and Mills said, but the broader trend points to more liquidity and renewed momentum for risk assets.
“The Fed also announced an end to quantitative tightening from December 1,” they wrote. “That is, after November, the Fed’s balance sheet will no longer be contracting by allowing maturing Treasury holdings to run off.”
“That’s the end of the liquidity drain,” they added. “From there, the Fed’s balance sheet will start rising again, providing the kind of environment in which Bitcoin historically thrives.”
They expect liquidity to ease further once the US federal government shutdown ends, freeing up Treasury Department spending and increasing bank reserves. 
Liquidity is “set to change quite significantly” in the next few weeks, the note said. “Bitcoin will reconnect to the broader risk picture and re-test record highs.”
Now, all eyes are on the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting in December.
The CME FedWatch tool puts the chances of another cut in December at 67%.
Brickell and Mills are not alone in their managed optimism.
Ryan Chow, CEO of Solv Protocol, a Bitcoin yield platform, told DL News that Bitcoin is “consolidating between $105,000 and $115,000 as markets digest prior gains and await clearer signals from central banks.”
“As ETF flows mature and allocations turn balance-sheet-driven rather than speculative,” Chow said, “volatility should gradually compress, setting the stage for the next structural leg higher.”
Mike Maloney, CEO of blockchain tech company Incyt, told DL News that sentiment has shifted “from exuberance to optimistically cautious,” but the trajectory is clear. 
“Expect Bitcoin to grace us with another all-time high by mid-November.”

Caterpillar (CAT) has been a standout performer in the industrial sector, buoyed by optimism around infrastructure spending and a resilient U.S. economy. Yet, after a sharp rally, investors are asking the key question — has the stock run too far, too fast?
 CAT stock has surged 10% over the last week and is presently trading at $577.26. Our comprehensive evaluation indicates that it might be prudent to consider selling CAT stock. Overall, we maintain a negative outlook on the stock, and a price of $404 could very well be achievable. We feel there are several concerns regarding CAT stock considering its overall Weak operational performance and financial health. Furthermore, given its High valuation, we view the stock as Unattractive.
Below is our assessment:
Smart investing isn’t about predicting, but about allocation. Check how Trefis’ Boston-based, wealth management partner approaches this. It has included High Quality Portfolio in its asset allocation strategy.

    Apple reportedly chose Google over Anthropic for financial reasons.
  
Google's Gemini to reportedly power the next version of Siri. 
Apple is turning to Google to make a custom Gemini AI model to power the next version of its virtual assistant Siri for spring 2026, according to a report from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman on Sunday. 
According to the report, Apple was evaluating whether to use Google or AI competitor Anthropic for the next version of Siri. Gurman says Google offered a better financial deal. In an earlier Bloomberg report, he says Anthropic would have cost Apple $1.5 billion per year. The report doesn't reveal Apple's own financial offer.
Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.
This custom Gemini model will run on Apple's private cloud compute servers. Apple's own models will continue to run on devices for personal data, while Gemini would operate on servers for more complex tasks. Gurman also says that Apple won't highlight Google's involvement in the company's marketing. 
Representatives for Google, Apple and Anthropic did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
With major tech companies pivoting toward AI, Apple has largely been left behind. The tech company was slow to adopt AI and hasn't developed AI models that are competitive. It instead turned to companies like OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, to help add generative capabilities on top of existing Apple systems. 
Even then, the promise of a truly agentic Apple Intelligence has failed to materialize, although it has improved. Apple CEO Tim Cook also hasn't ruled out the possibility of acquiring an AI company.
(Disclosure: Ziff Davis, CNET's parent company, in April filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)
Apple also has a close relationship with Google. The search giant pays Apple $20 billion annually to remain the default search engine on Apple devices. It's a relationship that nets Apple money and prevents it from building a competitor to Google Search, a claim Apple denies. This arrangement was an important factor in the Department of Justice's case against Google, where a judge ruled that the company was operating an illegal monopoly.

Alphabet (GOOGL)’s stock increased by 65%, in the past year, driven by robust earnings and a sharp margin enhancement, as investors welcomed AI advancement, cloud victories, and clearer antitrust regulations. With a rising P/E ratio and intelligent shareholder initiatives, the groundwork is laid for more thrilling developments ahead.
What is occurring in this situation? The stock price climbed 65%, propelled by a 13% revenue growth, a 16% increase in net margin, and a 23% rise in the P/E ratio. These changes prepare the groundwork for significant business developments in the future.
Before diving into details of events that led to the stock increase, consider what market wisdom indicates: GOOGL stock may experience volatility. A diversified allocation doesn’t. Trefis’ Boston-based wealth management partner combines strategy and discipline to mitigate market noise.
Here Is Why Alphabet Stock Moved
Our Current Assessment Of GOOGL Stock
Opinion: We currently perceive GOOGL stock as relatively overvalued. Why? Have a look at the full story. Read Buy or Sell GOOGL Stock to understand what influences our current view.
Risk: A helpful way to gauge GOOGL’s risk is by examining its drawdowns during significant market shocks. It dropped approximately 65% during the Global Financial Crisis, 44% during the Inflation Shock, and over 30% in the Covid sell-off. Even the correction in 2018 was not favorable, with a decline of about 23%. Therefore, while GOOGL appears solid on paper, history shows it can be vulnerable when markets decline.
Consistently identifying winners is a challenging endeavor - particularly considering the volatility associated with individual stocks. Instead, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four-year period. What accounts for this? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; offering a steadier ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics."

Blackstone (BX) shares are now at the seventh day of an ongoing losing streak, accumulating total losses of -9.3% during this timeframe. The recent sell off follows the company’s mixed Q3 2025 earnings. While the company grew revenue by 20% year-over-year, the numbers fell short of Wall Street’s expectations. Operating margins for the quarter were  below last year’s numbers, amid a less favorable mix of streams and some seasonal expenses.
Over the past seven days, the company has seen a decline of roughly $12 billion in value, bringing its current market cap to approximately $175 billion. The stock is currently 13.1% lower than it was at the close of 2024. This marks a contrast to the year-to-date returns of 16.3% for the S&P 500.
BX is an alternative asset management company specializing in various sectors including real estate, private equity, hedge funds, credit, secondary funds, public debt, equity, and multi-asset class strategies. Is this decline a red flag or a potential opportunity for recovery? Delve deeper with Buy or Sell BX.
Investing in a single stock carries risks, yet there is significant benefit to a wider, diversified strategy that we implement with the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Our focus extends beyond just equities. Would a portfolio composed of 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto, alongside equities and bonds, be expected to yield higher returns over the next 1-3 years and offer better protection in the event of a 20% market crash? We have analyzed the data.
Comparison of BX Stock Returns and the S&P 500
The table below details the return for BX stock compared to the S&P 500 index across various time frames, including the current losing streak:
What does this mean? Prolonged weakness can signify more than just random fluctuations. It frequently indicates changing market sentiment or underlying issues. A multi-day decline may suggest further drops ahead or offer a chance to invest if the fundamentals remain solid.

Winning and Losing Streaks: S&P 500 Constituents
Currently, there are 23 S&P 500 constituents with at least 3 consecutive days of gains and 92 constituents with at least 3 consecutive days of declines.
Key Financials for Blackstone (BX)
The current losing streak of BX stock does not instill much confidence in investors. Conversely, Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has historically significantly outperformed its benchmark, which encompasses all three - the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks yield better returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index, providing a more stable investment, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

34,2025-11-03,"My colleague Ryan last week expressed concern that Apple’s upcoming HomePod Touch device might be making the same mistake as the original speaker. 
But while I do suspect it may be something of a slow burn, I think the device will eventually achieve a much larger market even at the same price … 
Ryan’s concern was that a recent Bloomberg report suggested Apple is targeting the same $350 price for the new device. 
When Apple launched its first HomePod in 2018, it came with a whopping $349 price tag. In a recent Bloomberg report about the HomePod Touch, Mark Gurman writes “Apple has targeted a price of around $350 for the new device.” 
$350 sounds like the original HomePod launch all over again.
That’s an understandable concern given the history. While Apple has never released any sales figures, it’s widely considered that the original HomePod failed to achieve the traction the company had hoped.
I argued some years ago that this is because the product was misunderstood by most Apple customers.
Yes, if you think of the HomePod as an IA device, it is too expensive and too large. But if you think of it as a highly sophisticated speaker system, using beam-forming technology that debuted in speakers costing five figures and only relatively recently made it into four-figure ones, then they are both impressively compact and surprisingly affordable. It’s time to stop comparing them to tinny speakers costing $50, and start thinking of them as really good audio kit at a never-before-seen price point.
It was mostly only the audio media that reported it for what it was: an incredible amount of speaker for the money. Add in the ability to stereo-pair two of them, and to create high-quality multi-room audio at a price never seen before, and it really was a phenomenally impressive product.
The problem for Apple is that demand for impressive speaker systems is way smaller than for its other products. It is this, rather than the product being overpriced, that was responsible for its relative failure.
I do expect the HomePod touch to be a slow burn, but that’s less about the price and more about the fact that it only makes sense as a smart home controller – and then only for some smart homes.
If you don’t currently have any smart home devices, or only have a few smart bulbs, then the product really doesn’t make much sense. 
At the other end of the scale, if you have an extensive smart home and were an early adopter of the technology, then you may be equally uninterested. That’s me, and my own use of smart home tech is almost exclusively Siri controlled – ironically, perhaps mostly using the network of original HomePods I have around my home, though that wasn’t the reason I bought them.
Where I see demand for the HomePod Touch is mass market consumers who have started to get into smart home tech and aren’t really comfortable controlling everything by voice. I know from my own experience of less techie friends visiting my home that a visual panel makes more sense to them. This is the reason I actually ended up repurposing an old iPad as a dedicated smart home control panel.
Part of the reason for this, I think, is simply that relying on voice control requires you to remember the names of all your devices and scenes, and that’s much easier to do if you were the person who created those names. It’s harder for other family members, even if you tried to be as logical and consistent as possible.
Even if you are going to use a visual control panel, I would say techies are perfectly comfortable opening the Home app on their iPhone. But it surprised me how many non-techie friends considered that too complicated but responded well to an always-visible control panel on the wall.
That’s why I think HomePod Touch will, in time, become a successful product – and I don’t think a $350 price point would put people off once they start to experience all of the benefits of a smart home.
What’s your view? Do you think a $350 HomePod Touch would be a flop, or do you think it will succeed over time? Please share your thoughts in the comments.

 Stock futures are pointing higher to start the week as investors look ahead to another slew of earnings reports; OPEC+ agreed to pause output hikes; China said it would suspend additional rare earth curbs; Kimberly-Clark announced plans to buy Tylenol maker Kenvue; and Berkshire Hathaway's latest quarterly report showed its cash pile climbed to a record high.

 Here's what you need to know today.

 Stock futures are on the rise early Monday as investors prepare for a slew of earnings reports due from major technology and pharmaceutical companies this week, including an update from AI investor favorite Palantir (PLTR) after the closing bell today. The three major U.S. stock indexes come into today's session after ending October on a high note.

 Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.1% recently, while those linked to the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed 0.4% and 0.6%, respectively. Bitcoin was trading below $108,000. Gold futures were slightly higher, at around $4,019 an ounce. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note slid to around 4.08%.

 The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies on Sunday agreed to pause output hikes in the first quarter of 2026 after an increase due in December. The group of oil-producing nations has boosted its output targets since April, but began slowing the pace since October amid worries about a glut of supply. Crude oil futures climbed, then reversed course in early trading.

 China has agreed to suspend implementing additional rare earth export restrictions, as well as end investigations targeting American companies in the semiconductor supply chain, as part of the trade truce struck by President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, The White House announced over the weekend. China also said it would consider easing export restrictions on semiconductors made by chip firm Nexperia. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and other semiconductor firms are higher in premarket trading.

 Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A, BRK.B) cash stockpile hit yet another high, according to the conglomerate's quarterly update over the weekend. The buildup has fueled speculation that Warren Buffett could be concerned about the market overheating after a series of recent record highs, waiting for better opportunities, or deferring the company's allocation to his successor as he prepares to step down from his role as CEO at the end of the year.

 Kimberly-Clark (KMB), the maker of Huggies diapers and other consumer brands, agreed to buy Tylenol maker Kenvue (KVUE) in a cash-and-stock deal valued at about $48.7 billion. Kenvue faces a leadership shakeup and growing litigation concerns as the Trump administration has sought to draw links between its Tylenol and autism. Shares of Kenvue are soaring over 20% pre-market, while Kimberly-Clark's shares are down close to 15%.

Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. “Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, UAE, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria, and Oman reaffirm commitment to market stability on current healthy oil market fundamentals and steady global economic outlook and adjust production.”

Who doesnât love a good holiday countdown? Advent calendars build anticipation, make every single day more exciting, and are fun for both kids and adults. Of course, the whole process gets a bit more creative when it’s a LEGO set.
This year, LEGO is offering its Friends Advent calendar 2025, and itâs already on 40% off at Amazon, bringing the price down to just $21. Itâs marked as an Amazonâs Choice product, but thereâs no telling how long the discount will last. If youâve been thinking about grabbing one, nowâs a good time to pick it up for less. Keep in mind that all other LEGO Advent calendars are now out of stock.
See at Amazon
The set includes a total of 237 pieces with 24 buildable surprises, for 24 days of fun. The theme is about a holiday sleepover with Lego friends; Aliya, Autumn, Liann, Nova, and Leo. Each character gets their own cozy mattress to get some beauty sleep, and the crew is also accompanied by five adorable pets, including a guinea pig, a gecko, two dogs, and a cat. To spoil these furry friends, thereâs a whole bunch of accessories, like a bone, scratching post, pet bed, food station, and water dispenser.
The whole setup comes together with some magical holiday touches like a cozy fireplace, a sled, a sofa to lounge on, a bright lamp, and a bunch of colorful gift boxes. Thereâs even a little Lego brick reindeer plushie to round it all out. And since the calendar opens up to double as a small play area, kids can use it to set up the full sleepover scene and get creative with their own stories. Maybe itâs a hot chocolate night while the pets throw their own little party in the corner. Or a Christmas tree decorating session with a surprise visit from Leo on the hobbyhorse! The possibilities are endless, and the fun goes on even after Christmas.
Everything is compatible with other LEGO Friends sets, so itâs easy to keep building. You can even plan a fun streaming night with Lego Friends: The Next Chapter, where kids can get to know the Heartlake City crew and maybe add a few more sets over time to expand the whole setup.
Altogether, if youâve been planning to treat your kids to an exciting advent calendar that fuels their creativity, this set is a great option to consider. Itâs now down to just $21 for a short time, which makes it even more approachable.

Gaming sessions with friends hit different when everyone has a controller: There’s nothing worse than passing around one gamepad or having to troubleshoot compatibility across various devices. The Xbox wireless controller has become the go-to option for millions of gamers and right now, Amazon has it down to just $39 from its usual $64 price. That’s practically half the cost of Sony’s DualSense controller, and it makes this deal all that much sweeter if you need to stock up on extra controllers for those multiplayer sessions.
See at Amazon
New in this 2025 edition of the Xbox controller are features that truly make for meaningful changes in your experience while gaming: The battery life runs as long as 40 hours on one set of two AA batteries which means you can game through several weekends without having to fear running out of power. This controller now includes a 9-foot USB-C cable right in the box for easy flexibility between wireless freedom and the reliability of a wired connection at any time.
These ergonomic updates to the controller have made marathon gaming sessions far more comfortable. Xbox has refined the sculpted surfaces and geometry for a better fit of various hand sizes while adding textured grips on the triggers, bumpers, and back case. These grip enhancements give you more control in high-intensity moments when your palms start sweating and this hybrid D-pad provides a nice balance between precision and comfort in fighting games and menu navigation alike. The Share button integration is really handy, too: you can capture screenshots and recordings without having to fumble through menus or break focus during crucial gameplay moments.
In real-world practicality, the strength of this controller comes in with cross-platform compatibility: You can pair it wirelessly via Xbox Wireless or Bluetooth to your console, PC, phone, tablet, Fire TV Stick, smart TV, or even VR headsets. That means one controller works across your whole gaming ecosystem, not different gamepads for different devices. A 3.5mm headset jack lets you plug any compatible headset directly into it, and a USB-C port supports direct plug-and-play connections to your console or PC without any setup hassle.
At $39, you’re getting a premium controller that normally sells for $64, and this represents the lowest price we’ve tracked for this model. With over 21,000 reviews averaging 4.6 stars and more than 10,000 units purchased in the past month alone, this controller has proven itself in real-world use.

Black Friday and Cyber Monday are still a few weeks out, but some of the yearâs best tech deals are already rolling in. That makes now a great time to grab Apple gear, especially since the brand rarely offers direct discounts. And if youâve had your eye on a new iPad, now might be the time to act.
Currently, the 11-inch WiFi Apple iPad with the superfast A16 chip ans 128GB storage is sitting at $299 on Amazon, which is 14% off its regular $349 price. Even better, all color options are discounted, so whether youâre looking for a basic silver or want something with a pop of color, youâve got options. The only catch? Thereâs no telling how long the discount or the stock will last, so we recommend acting fast if you want to lock it in.
See at Amazon
Youâre getting an 11-inch Liquid Retina display that supports a 2360 x 1640 resolution for stunning visuals. True Tone automatically adjusts the display according to the color temperature of your room, so you wonât have to manually tweak brightness or other settings to stay comfortable.
The device runs on iPadOS and is powered by Appleâs A16 chip that ensures speedy, snappy performance, even when youâre hopping between multiple apps at once. This version comes with 128GB of storage, which is more than enough to house all your important data in one place. 128GB is the sweet spot for most users, but if it feels limited, you can upgrade to models with up to 512GB of storage. Though, of course, those come with a higher price tag.
Thereâs a 12MP front camera for clear video calls, plus a 12MP rear camera to snap photos. The front camera features Center Stage, so you stay the center of attention on calls, not your couch in the background. Connectivity is made easy with Wi-Fi 6 built in, and the all-day battery life helps you get through your busiest days without stressing about running out of charge.
If youâre looking for a full work or creative setup on the go, you can always add Appleâs Magic Keyboard Folio and USB-C Apple Pencil, both of which are sold separately. For $299, youâre getting solid value packed in a slim, sleek build. If an iPad has been on your wishlist, this might be your best chance to grab it before the holiday rush hits.

In a market driven by hype and momentum, Accenture (ACN) stands out as a steady performer with solid fundamentals and a discounted valuation — proof that “boring” can still be beautiful.
Here is why we believe ACN stock merits attention as a value investment. It is currently priced about 36% lower than its 1-year peak and is trading at a PS multiple that is less than the average over the past 3 years. Nevertheless, it is growing—albeit slowly—and boasts impressive margins alongside its low valuation.
As a brief overview, Accenture offers strategy, consulting, technology, and operations services, which includes application modernization, agile transformation, AI, data management, intelligent automation, and talent and organizational consulting.
Love the ACN stock? Excellent. But don’t become too attached. Stocks can plummet. High Quality Portfolio helps you navigate that risk.
Do these figures provide the complete picture? Read Buy or Sell ACN Stock to determine if Accenture continues to maintain an advantage that withstands scrutiny.
Stocks Like These Can Outperform. Here Is Data
Below are statistics for stocks with the same selection strategy applied between 12/31/2016 and 6/30/2025.
But Consider The Risk
That being said, Accenture is not free from significant declines. It decreased by approximately 38% during the Global Financial Crisis, 40% amid the 2022 inflation impact, and 33% throughout the Covid pandemic. The 2018 correction also resulted in a 23% drop. Strong fundamentals are important, but even resilient stocks like ACN can experience notable declines during market turbulence.
However, the risk is not confined to substantial market crashes. Stocks can decline even in favorable market conditions—consider events such as earnings reports, business news, or changes in outlook. Read ACN Dip Buyer Analyses to see how the stock has bounced back from steep declines in the past.

One of the devs on the long-canned Halo MMO has blamed the game's demise on corporate greed.
By 
    Hayley Williams
   on November 3, 2025 at 5:05AM PST
Back in 2005, rumors swirled of a Halo MMO in development with Age of Empires developer Ensemble Studios. The project came to an abrupt end in 2008 when Microsoft shuttered the studio, however one of the developers on the MMO has spilled the beans on the lost game--and why it was cancelled.
Sandy Peterson, known for his work on the Call of Cthulu TTRPG and Doom before he moved to Ensemble, has posted a thread on X with his recollections about the doomed Halo MMO, which was codenamed Titan. He says that he was in charge of the universe-building for the project, which was going to be set in the far past before the Halos destroyed all sentient life in the galaxy.

""The lowest estimate we & Microsoft had for the game's total income was $1.1 billion,"" Peterson claims. Earlier reports about the cancelled MMO backed up Microsoft's early commitment to the ambitious project, saying that Titan had been allocated a massive $90 million budget.
According to Petersen, the problem arose when Don Mattrick, who was promoted to head of Xbox in 2007, ""realized that his stock bonus was based on the income MS had from games in 3 years."" This timing was problematic for Titan, which Petersen said was estimated at the time to need 3.5 years to finish properly.
""And that’s beyond Mattrick's drop dead date,"" Petersen concludes. ""So by firing ALL of Ensemble, he didn't have to pay for our expensive studio for 3 years and he didn't care about Titan."" Petersen doesn't say whether he saw proof that this was the case, or if this is just his read on the situation, but earlier reports on Ensemble's closure also noted office politics as one of the main factors in the studio's demise.
Mattrick's reign at Xbox was largely an unpopular one with fans, with the exec presiding over the Kinect, the much-maligned dashboard redesign, and the disastrous launch of the Xbox One. ""All he lost was a game studio who never sold less than 3 million copies of everything we made,"" Petersen added on the Ensemble closure. ""I don't believe he did justice to Microsoft stockholders but hey - Don started as an EA hatchet man so what would you expect?""

With Amazon.com increasing by 9.6% in a single day, it’s a good time to reassess it in comparison to its competitors. Regularly evaluating alternatives is fundamental to a solid investment strategy. Here’s how Amazon.com (AMZN) stock compares to its rivals in terms of size, valuation, growth, and margin.
As a brief overview, Amazon.com offers retail sales of consumer products and subscriptions worldwide, provides cloud services, and manufactures electronic devices such as Kindles, Fire tablets, Fire TVs, Rings, and Echo.
Investing in a single stock can be risky; however, there is significant value in a broader, diversified approach that we pursue with the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. We extend our focus beyond equities. Will a portfolio consisting of 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto alongside equities and bonds yield better returns over the next 1-3 years and provide better protection in the event of a 20% market crash? We've analyzed the data.
Why does this matter? AMZN has recently increased by 9.8% in a month – comparing it to peers contextualizes stock performance, valuation, and financial health – highlighting whether it is genuinely outpacing the competition or falling behind, and most importantly – can this trend persist? Read Buy or Sell AMZN Stock to determine if Amazon.com remains a solid investment. Moreover, there is always a risk of a downturn following a significant uptick – explore how the stock has fluctuated and bounced back historically through the AMZN Dip Buyer Analysis perspective.

I'm talking, of course, about this deal from Mint Mobile that carves a whopping $600 off the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL when you sign up for a year of the Unlimited plan. 
No trade-in is required, and to make the deal even sweeter, Mint will also slash 50% off the wireless. In other words, you'll be getting one of the best phones of 2025 and a full year of unlimited T-Mobile-powered wireless for hundreds less than it would cost to buy the Pixel 10 Pro XL unlocked. I don't know how Mint Mobile can afford to release deals like this, but I'm going to ride this wave as long as I can. 
Google Pixel 10 Pro XL 256GB: $1,199 $599, plus 50% off one year of Unlimited at Mint Mobile
Head to Mint Mobile and purchase the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL alongside one year of the Unlimited plan and you'll score 50% OFF both the wireless and the phone. That's $780 of total savings, no trade-in required and no confusing contracts or credit checks to worry about. 
✅Recommended if: you're looking for a sophisticated, AI-powered smartphone with outstanding cameras and a vibrant 120Hz display; you're ready to switch wireless carriers and you live in an area with good T-Mobile coverage.
❌Skip this deal if: you're happy with your current phone plan; you need a phone with great gaming performance; you don't want to be locked into a single phone plan for a year. 
Just like the Pixel phones that came before it, the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL is a dream for any Android user who values great camera tech and powerful AI features in their devices. Typically starting at $1,199 for the 256GB configuration, the Pixel 10 Pro XL boasts a gorgeous 6.8-inch Super Actua display with a 120Hz refresh rate, while under the hood you'll get 16GB of RAM and the efficiency of the new Tensor G5 processor. 
The XL also comes equipped with all of the latest AI-boosted software features, many of which are exclusive to Pixel, such as Magic Cue, Pixel Journal, and Daily Hub. Like the rest of the Pixel 10 lineup, the XL also now supports Qi2 accessories, and the phone's battery life is better than ever.
 



On the other end of things, the Google Pixel 10 series does still lag behind certain Android phones when it comes to gaming performance and max processing speeds, and some folks aren't going to be happy about the Pixel 10 being restricted to eSIM-only in the United States. 
Moreover, this Mint Mobile deal only really works if you're cool committing to the T-Mobile-owned carrier for a full year. I, for one, have no problem using the popular MVNO for twelve months if it means I can score 50% off the Pixel 10 Pro XL. After all, it's not like Mint Mobile is some subpar phone company. 
I've used Mint on and off for years, and the plan in question is still one of the best unlimited plans around if you value simplicity and affordability from your carrier. You get unlimited talk, text, and data powered by the world's largest 5G network, plus a free mobile hotspot and unlimited calls to Mexico, Canada, and the UK. Throw in a great Android phone for 50% off and you're looking at a deal that might make Black Friday shopping totally unnecessary this year.

YouTube TV consumers will undoubtedly know that Disney's channels vanished late last week; however, the two have continued talks, albeit a little rocky.
There are two sides to this, as reported by Deadline, as YouTube TV claims Disney has been ""unnecessarily aggressive and assertive."" According to the publication, this is in regard to the ""economics"" of pay-TV, per an executive the post cites. The exec told Deadline in a statement that, regarding Disney, ""There are aspects of their portfolio that are doing well on our platform."" However, everything isn't so clean cut, as they add that their ""broad portfolio"" may contain channels where viewership may ""decline"" or become ""non-existent.""
It's because of this thinking that the exec reportedly informed the publication that Disney was expecting ""steep carriage fees,"" despite its viewership dropping a bit in recent years. Disney has also reportedly dismissed this statement, saying that it's actually tried to offer services that ""lower"" costs for the consumer.
Apparently, there were some rumors about Disney potentially using its acquisition of Fubo, as well as Hulu Live, as ""leverage"" for its current negotiations with YouTube TV. A Disney executive reportedly cut down that theory, stating YouTube TV was “intentionally misrepresenting the situation.""
From the recent reports, it seems clear that consumers are going to have to continue waiting for a YouTube TV, Disney agreement. Even the fate of ESPN on the platform is in the air, which doesn't bode well for sports lovers.
 



Android Central has reached out to YouTube TV and Disney about the latest stalemate report and will update this post if we hear back.
Last week, we were rapidly approaching the deadline for a content deal between YouTube TV and Disney. The former claimed it had entered negotiations with the latter in order to keep channels like ABC and ESPN for its subscribers. However, similar to what we've heard today in the recent report, YouTube TV claimed Disney's proposals would've led to a price hike for viewers.

Still, Disney pointed the blame at YouTube TV, stating it was ""exploiting its position at the expense of their own customers.""
Both sides had until October 30 at 11:59 pm ET to reach some sort of middle ground, but that didn't happen. With the contract up, viewers lost 21 channels, including ABC and ESPN. YouTube TV and Disney delivered their own statements, each defending their stances, which only lengthens this blackout for consumers. According to Disney, ""Google is using its market dominance to eliminate competition and undercut the industry-standard terms we’ve successfully negotiated with every other distributor.""
It's a similar sentiment we've heard Deadline report from a Disney exec.

RetroSoulja Boy 
What is DeAndre “SouljaBoy” Cortez up to these days? I’m not sure anyone’s asking that in the Year of our Lord 2025, but if they were the answer would probably surprise them. According to his latest post on Instagram, the rapper behind the 2007 hit “Crank That (Soulja Boy)” is once again trying to hawk someone else’s retro handhelds under his own own made-up brand.
SouljaGame Flip appears to just be a Retroid Pocket Flip 2, except that it costs more than double ($435 vs $210) and will be shipped to you from some other warehouse. “Not a single gamer buying this. Especially at that price,” one person earnestly responded on Instagram. “Play some games on it. Whereâs the gameplay? Is it an emulator??? Rather get a Steam Deck for less that does more.”
The Instagram post promoting the scalper performance art was spotted by Retro Dodo which proceeded to ask the company that makes Retroid about it. “I didn’t know about this,” a representative told the site. “This is not any kind of official licensing deal. He does not have permission to rebrand our products and sell them as his own. The Retroid Pocket Flip 2 is patented in the U.S by ourselves.”
 View this post on Instagram

This is far from the first time that Soulja Boy has pulled this stunt. In 2018 he started flipping other Chinese-made retro emulation devices, only for some of them to come installed with ROMs for Nintendo games. The infamously litigious Mario maker did not take it well. He claimed Nintendo wouldn’t sue. “I had to boss up, I didnât have a choice,” he posted on X after being threatened.
But that hasn’t stopped him from returning every couple of years with a new fake Soulja Boy handheld. In 2022, he was pushing another stolen Game Boy knockoff. The retro handheld market has only gotten bigger in the years since. That makes getting in on the action more lucrative than ever, but also more likely to get called out.
“[Soulja Boy] has been rebranding consoles before Xbox did with the ROG Ally X,” wrote one person on Instagram.
Update; 11/3/2025, 5:11 p.m. ET: Soulja Boy has apparently backed off the price gouging but is still ripping off Retroid.
After this tweet came out, the ""SouljaGame Flip"" (which is just a drop-shipped Retroid Pocket Flip 2) was reduced in price from $436 to $200 with free shipping ð https://t.co/2XiC7CdqZk pic.twitter.com/CWxOVWzsRd

Texas Instruments (TXN) stock warrants your attention. Why? Because you receive high margins – indicative of pricing power and cash generation ability – at a discounted price. Here is some data.
Although revenue growth is beneficial, this is not a growth viewpoint. Pricing power and high margins deliver consistent, predictable profits and cash flows, which lowers risk and permits capital reinvestment. The market tends to reward this.
Now TXN stock has been a clear under-performer, declining by about 13% year-to-date, compared to many other high-flying semiconductor names which have seen massive AI fueled rallies. The headwinds come amid mixed quarterly earnings and a slower than expected industry recovery for analog chips in the automotive and industrial sectors, amid tariff uncertainty. 
However, TXN’s analog and embedded processing chips are essential across diverse industries, providing stable demand in the longer-run. The company is also investing in new 300mm wafer fabs in Texas, which should improve manufacturing efficiency, lower costs, and enhance long-term margins.
As a brief overview, Texas Instruments supplies semiconductors, including power management solutions and microcontrollers, for electronic designers and manufacturers across the Analog and Embedded Processing sectors.
 
 
But do these figures convey the entire picture? Read Buy or Sell TXN Stock to determine if Texas Instruments still maintains an advantage that holds true under scrutiny.
Portfolio strategies consistently outperform stock-picking methods. Imagine the long-term performance for your portfolio if you integrated 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto with equities.
 
Stocks Like These Can Outperform. Here Is Data
This is how we select stocks: We look at those with a market cap greater than $10 billion and then filter out those with high cash flow from operations (CFO) margins or operating margins. We also focus exclusively on stocks that have significantly decreased in valuation over the past year.
The following are statistics for stocks with this selection strategy applied since 12/31/2016.
But Consider The Risk
Texas Instruments is not immune to substantial declines. It dropped 77% during the Dot-Com crash and 64% throughout the Global Financial Crisis. Even in less severe downturns—such as the 2018 correction, Covid pandemic, and inflation surge—it still fell approximately 25-30%. Strong fundamentals are important, but when the market shifts, TXN can experience a significant decline.
The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which comprises 30 stocks, has a proven history of comfortably outperforming its benchmark, which includes all 3 – the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. What accounts for this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided better returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; less volatility, as illustrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

            The fingerprints of artificial intelligence are all over mass layoffs and downsizing at Meta, Amazon, Salesforce, YouTube and other major companies, raising fears of an AI-fueled jobs wipeout for white-collar workers.
    

            AI may hurt demand for office workers, but there’s reason for hope, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon believes. The dynamic American workforce will evolve, as it has in the past, Solomon told CNN during a sit-down interview.
    

            Solomon, speaking from the sidelines of the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Summit in Washington, cited the disruption caused by the invention in the late 1700s of the steam engine, which helped fuel the first industrial revolution.
    

            “There will be disruption. But I’m a big believer that our economy is very nimble, very flexible. And when you look at the technology that has flooded over hundreds of years into our society, we adapt,” Solomon said. “We find new businesses. We find new jobs. I don’t believe it will be different this time.”
    

            Of course, that adjustment process can be difficult – especially for the workers whose careers have been sidelined by new technology.
    

            A key difference this time is the explosive speed at which AI is being embraced by businesses – and how rapidly AI itself is advancing. A Goldman Sachs survey of bankers found that 37% of clients are using AI for regular production, with adoption expected to hit 50% next year and 74% in the next three years.
    

            ChatGPT launched in November 2022 and now boasts 800 million weekly active users. Its parent company OpenAI is reportedly laying the groundwork for an IPO that could value it at up to $1 trillion.
    

            Today’s AI chatbots can do deep research, generate stunningly realistic films, compose music and instantly flag financial fraud before it can even get completed.
    

            That speed could make the transition bumpier this time around.
    

            “The pace of adoption of this technology is going a little bit faster. As businesses wrestle with deploying the technology and the automation, the short-term disruption might be a little bit higher,” the Goldman Sachs CEO said. “But our economy is incredibly broad and nimble.”
    

            Office workers may be especially exposed to that disruption.
    

            Although Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told analysts the company’s recent 14,000 layoffs were “not even really AI driven,” he said in June that adopting generative AI and AI agents will shrink the company’s corporate workforce.
    

            Meta recently cut 600 roles within its AI team, which reports have indicated is part of an effort to move more nimbly. YouTube this week began offering voluntary buyouts to US employees as part of an AI-focused restructuring.
    

            Workers at Chegg, an online education company, are being hurt by AI on two fronts. First, the rise of ChatGPT is lowering demand for Chegg’s education services. Secondly, Chegg itself is investing in AI, promising to run its business leaner with fewer workers to compete. This week Chegg said it will slash nearly half its workforce as it grapples with the “new realities of AI” and lower search traffic.
    

            AI was cited as a reason for 17,375 layoff announcements this year tracked by outplacement and coaching firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas through the end of September. That represents less than 2% of the total layoffs announced this year.
    

            However, Challenger noted that this tally likely undershoots AI-linked layoffs. Another 20,219 job cuts announced during that period were tied to companies citing unspecified technological updates – some of which could be related to AI.
    

            “The need for some white-collar office jobs will be diminished, but they’ll be picked up in other parts of the economy,” said Solomon.
    

            By contrast, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has warned that AI could eliminate half of entry-level jobs in white-collar professions, lifting the unemployment rate to up to 20% in the near future.
    

            “It’s eerie the extent to which the broader public and politicians, legislators, I don’t think, are fully aware of what’s going on,” Amodei told CNN’s Anderson Cooper in May. “We have to act now. We can’t just sleepwalk into it.”
    

            Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged during a press conference that a “significant number of companies” are either doing layoffs or saying they won’t hire much in part because of AI.
    

            “We’re watching that very carefully…It could absolutely have implications for job creation,” Powell said.
    

            A survey of over 100 Goldman Sachs investment bankers finds that just 11% of US companies are “actively reducing headcount due to AI,” a report published last week said. However, that figure rises to 31% for tech, media and telecom companies.
    

            Goldman Sachs bankers expect AI will lead to “modest headcount reductions” of 4% over the next year. But that number could rise to 11% over the next three years – especially in customer service jobs.
    

            Jan Hatzius, Goldman’s chief economist, wrote that the findings support the bank’s view that AI will have a “transformative impact on the labor market and economy,” and that rapid adoption signals that “AI impacts on the US labor market could arrive sooner than expected.”
    

            The AI boom has also raised worries about a bubble forming in this red-hot part of the market.
    

            Solomon said that while many “great companies” will be formed during the AI boom, at some point the exuberance could get overdone and it won’t be a “straight line up” in value.
    

            One scenario he laid out is that demand for AI services may at some point fail to reach lofty expectations, driving valuations down.
    

            But that process could take time to play out because, as Solomon noted, most public tech companies are well-established and the newer AI companies are largely still in private markets, where valuation markdowns only change slowly.
    

            “The technology is exciting – there should be a lot of enthusiasm for it,” Solomon said. “But there will be bumps along the way, too.”

The government shutdown isn't stopping the Trump administration from forging ahead with its student-loan repayment changes.
On Monday, the Department of Education will begin its second week of negotiations with stakeholders on President Donald Trump's plan to overhaul repayment plans and impose new caps on borrowing. The changes were codified in Trump's ""big beautiful"" spending bill, which he signed into law in July. The department is now undergoing negotiated rulemaking, a process that includes negotiation sessions and periods of public comment, with implementation set to begin in July 2026.
The negotiations are continuing despite the ongoing government shutdown. Jeff Andrade, the department's deputy assistant secretary for policy, told negotiators during the first session in October that a lapse in appropriations would not prevent the rulemaking process from moving forward.
""Failure to actively continue work towards promulgating these regulatory changes would substantially impair otherwise funded programs, like Pell Grants and direct loans, from implementing new statutory requirements by the statutory deadlines under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" Andrade said.
While the sessions will continue, the shutdown means that information negotiators receive from the department, like proposed text for the rule, will not be posted on the department's website until the shutdown ends. Still, the sessions are made available to the public via livestream.
Here's where Trump's repayment overhaul stands ahead of the second week of negotiations.
A topic that dominated the first negotiation session was the department's proposed changes to graduate and professional borrowing. Trump's spending law eliminated the Grad PLUS program, which allowed graduate and professional students to borrow up to the full cost of attendance for their programs. It also implemented new borrowing caps: $20,500 a year or $100,000 over a lifetime for graduate students, and $50,000 a year and $200,000 over a lifetime for professional students.
The department also proposed that the higher professional degree cap would be limited to 10 programs: pharmacy, dentistry, veterinary medicine, chiropractic, law, medicine, optometry, osteopathic medicine, podiatry, and theology.
Negotiators raised concerns with the caps and the list of degrees that would qualify, especially because many advanced degree programs cost more than the caps and could lead borrowers to either forgo their degrees or use the private student-loan market for additional financing.
""There are some professions here that are crucial to our state economic development and workforce development, and this list doesn't have it, so I'm concerned this is going to really cripple certain aspects of what we're trying to get done here,"" Bennett Boggs, a negotiater and commissioner of the Missouri Department of Higher Education & Workforce Development, said during the first week of negotiations.
In addition to the new borrowing caps, the department also plans to eliminate existing income-driven repayment plans and replace them with two options: a standard repayment plan and a new Repayment Assistance Plan, which would allow for forgiveness of remaining balances after 30 years.
The department said it would implement the new plans by July 1, 2026. Borrowers who took out loans prior to that date would be able to retain access to the existing income-based repayment plan, while borrowers who take out loans after that date can enroll in the Repayment Assistance Plan.
The proposals could still change as negotiations continue this week. The public will then have an opportunity to comment before the department moves toward final implementation.

Billionaire Izzy Englander has sold a chunk of his hedge fund giant Millennium Management to investors.
Millennium, one of the largest and most successful hedge funds in the world, told employees in a memo on Monday that it had completed a deal to sell 15% of the firm to investors, according to a copy of the memo seen by Business Insider.
The sale of a roughly $2 billion equity stake in the fund values Millennium at about $14 billion, according to a person with knowledge of the deal who wasn't authorized to share the information.
A Millennium spokesman declined to comment.
""We are pleased to announce the successful completion of the sale of a minority, passive equity interest in Millennium's management company. This transaction is the latest step in our evolution and further positions Millennium for the future,"" the memo reads in part.
Some of Millennium's largest existing backers participated in the deal, according to the memo. It was executed by Goldman Sachs Asset Management's Petershill unit, which makes minority investments in private-equity firms, hedge funds, and other alternative investment managers.
Millennium charges fees and a cut of the fund's performance to manage capital. Englander and other equity holders get a slice of that income stream.
Millennium, founded in 1989 by Englander, has grown into one of the largest hedge funds globally, with over 6,400 employees and 330 investment teams managing $79 billion in assets.
The fund's long-running success — it has averaged a return of about 14% annually since inception and has only lost money once in 35 years — has fueled that growth and enabled it to secure a more stable capital base than most hedge funds, locking up investor cash for five years.
It's a significant valuation, especially when compared to others in the industry that have gone public or been bought. Man Group, which manages hedge funds and other alternative investment vehicles, has a market cap of roughly $3.2 billion. Sculptor Capital Management, formerly known as Och-Ziff, was taken private in 2023 in a deal valuing the manager at just over $700 million.
In the memo, Millennium said the minority stake sale was a continuation of its recent efforts to ensure the hedge fund's endurance as a financial institution. Englander, 77, has expanded his executive roster in recent years to help manage its heft.
""Izzy and the management team believe that the actions we have taken further reinforce the durability of the Firm, support the longevity of our business, and position Millennium for continued growth and success in the future,"" the memo reads.
Millennium was up 6% through September.

Between billion-dollar investments and global market shocks, partners at Goldman Sachs have no shortage of things to worry about. But two of them share a common nighttime preoccupation.
Business Insider separately asked Meena Lakdawala-Flynn, co-head of Global Private Wealth Management and One Goldman Sachs, and Asahi Pompey, global head of the Office of Corporate Engagement and chair of the Urban Investment Group, what keeps them awake at night.
""I'm always thinking about our people,"" said Lakdawala-Flynn, who has been at the firm for more than 25 years and became a partner in 2014. ""You've built talent, you've invested in talent, they're cultural stewards. To me, it's about retaining people.""
She added that having a ""rotating door"" makes it more difficult to create strong businesses and client solutions. Lakdawala-Flynn manages teams of private wealth advisors, who themselves work with the bank's ultra-high-net-worth clients. As of late last year, Goldman had 39 private wealth management offices around the world.
Pompey, who is nearing two decades at Goldman and became a partner in 2018, also said ""our people.""
""You have the careers of all these individuals in your hands,"" she said. ""Are you doing the very best you can to amplify their talents, give them the opportunities that they need to succeed? I think about that. That keeps me up.""
The firm will, she said, ""ultimately win or lose on the back of the talent that we have and the development of that talent."" Pompey oversees initiatives including 10,000 Small Businesses, 10,000 Women, and One Million Black Women.
Goldman is about to announce its next class of managing directors, who sit one rung below partners in the firm's leadership hierarchy. The bank has come under scrutiny in recent years for an exodus of female leadership and a general lack of women in the most senior positions. Yesterday, CEO David Solomon said Goldman had ""made a bunch of progress, especially in the senior ranks, but candidly not enough, and we continue to be focused on creating opportunities.""
Pompey also said that she still worries about the little things when trying to fall asleep.
""The thought that the more senior you get, you somehow don't sweat the details — I sweat the details about what we're doing, being stewards of the firm's resources, that we're doing it at the highest level for maximum impact, where we should be pivoting or doing things differently,"" she said.

Oracle (ORCL) stock could be a strong contender to capitalize on the current momentum. Why? Because it possesses strong margins, a low-debt capital structure, and strong momentum. Here are some statistics.
While revenue growth is beneficial, this selection focuses on harnessing momentum with quality – a judgment based on margins (indicative of pricing power / robust business model) and capital structure (not excessively debt-laden). Also see, Oracle Stock To $183?
Oracle’s stock skyrocketed by nearly 40% in a single day on September 10, 2025, its biggest one-day jump in over three decades, after the company unveiled a massive $455 billion cloud and AI backlog and announced several large-scale infrastructure contracts tied to artificial intelligence. The rally, which added over $200 billion to Oracle’s market capitalization and briefly pushed it toward the $1 trillion mark, reflected soaring investor confidence in Oracle’s position as a major player in the AI-driven cloud infrastructure space. 
To provide some context, Oracle offers cloud software as a service, specialized cloud solutions, application licenses, license support, an enterprise database, a development language, and middleware services.
But do these figures reveal the complete narrative? Read Buy or Sell ORCL Stock to determine if Oracle remains competitive beneath the surface.
Stock picking often yields disappointing results. High Quality Portfolio transforms insights from individual stocks into a solid market-beating portfolio strategy.
Stocks Like These Can Outperform. Here Is Data
Here is our method for selection: We focus on stocks with a market cap over $2 Billion, high operating and cash flow from operations (CFO) margin, no significant revenue decline in the last 5 years, a low-debt capital structure, and strong momentum as described by our proprietary momentum metric.
Presented below are statistics for stocks that adhere to this selection strategy from 12/31/2016 to 6/30/2025.
But Consider The Risk
Nonetheless, Oracle is not protected from substantial declines. It dropped nearly 77% during the Dot-Com Bubble and fell over 41% throughout the Global Financial Crisis. The Inflation Shock was also detrimental, with a 40% decrease. Even smaller incidents—like the 2018 Correction and the Covid Pandemic—caused declines of approximately 19% and 29%, respectively. Strong fundamentals are essential, but during sell-offs, Oracle can experience severe pullbacks.
The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, boasts a history of comfortably outperforming its benchmark that encompasses all three – the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks provided superior returns with diminished risk compared to the benchmark index; a smoother experience, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics."

EXCLUSIVE: L.A.’s Utopai Studios and global tech firm Stock Farm Road are looking for the next KPop Demon Hunters.

	The pair are planning a joint venture, Utopai Studios East, which will bring more K-content into the U.S and build connections between Korea and Hollywood, using AI expert Utopai’s tech and Stock Farm Road’s infrastructure and cash reserves. 

	Financial terms haven’t been revealed but sources close to the company say the investment will be in the “multibillion-dollar” range. We hear the financing is coming from Stock Farm Road’s investment vehicle, global sovereign and institutional investors, and “industry partners” in film and entertainment.

	Utopai founder and CEO Cecilia Shen will lead the venture, which brings together her Sunnyvale-based company with Stock Farm Road’s founders, Brian Koo and Amin Badr-El-Din. The pact designates Utopai as the exclusive AI tech partner for entertainment for Stock Farm Road, which is reportedly looking to turn Korea into a $35B artificial intelligence data center.




			Watch on Deadline		






	Koo is known as a member of family that controls Korean electronics brand LG, while Badr-El-Din was founder and former Chairman and CEO of the UAE Offsets Group, which gave rise to state-owned wealth fund Mubadala and other major sovereign investment initiatives in the UAE.

	Bolstering Utopai East are a pair of senior hires, former Sony Network Entertainment exec Kevin Chong and ex-CJ America director Richard Lee. 

	Chong is currently Head of Corporate and Business Development at LG Electronics’ North American Innovation Center (LG NOVA) within the Chief Strategy Office, and has been working with startups and venture groups across Silicon Valley on the project. Lee led on international growth initiatives for Parasite company CJ in his former role as director and Head of Open Innovation at CJ America.

	Sources close to the JV say they will see investment in the “multiple billions of dollars,” coming in around the “ten-figure” mark in total. That’s a huge number, but given the wealth and assets of the investors, and the ambition of the venture, it’s the plan.

	










	The plan is to mesh Utopai’s expertise in AI filmmaking workflow with Stock Farm Road’s international infrastructure so that new pathways open between Korea and the U.S., and see more Korean film and TV hit the American market. This will include co-producing film and TV projects, and backing Korean IP on the international stage.

	The partners say Utopai East’s proprietary AI-native workflow system and tech has been built to “collaborate with filmmakers, rather than automate them,” and is “built on the belief that technology should extend human imagination, not replace it.” 

	AI tools are built into steps of the creative process such as scripting, directorial vision and acting performances, with the focus on aiding the human workflow.

	“Most AI video models are built to impress with visuals,” said Shen. “Ours is built to understand storytelling. This partnership with Stock Farm Road allows us to take that principle beyond our own studio, building creative infrastructure where human artistry and production intelligence advance together responsibly and at scale.”

	“This initiative will catalyze new opportunities for storytelling and cultural exchange, positioning SFR as a leader in the digital entertainment revolution,” added Badr-El-Din.

	Shen will serve as the lead founding member of the Stock Farm Road Brain Trust, an advisory board focused on insights into the future of an AI-driven world. Also in the group are Alphabet chair John Hennessy and Neelie Kroes, former European Union Commissioner for Digital and Architect of Europe’s Digital Strategy.

	Koo, who co-chairs Stock Farm Road with Badr-El-Din, said: “Cecilia’s expertise and innovative mindset are perfectly aligned with our vision to revolutionize entertainment through AI. Her leadership in this joint venture signifies our commitment to creating next-generation content that resonates globally and pushes the boundaries of technology and creativity.”

	Stock Farm Road earlier this year announced plans for a $35B AI-powered data center in Korea. The company wants to extend those plans into entertainment, citing data that shows Korean content is watched by more than a third of global viewers, according to Ampere Analysis and that K-Pop Demon Hunters is the second-most globally-demanded original film this year.

 Home Depot (HD) has quietly built a reputation not just as a home improvement giant, but as one of the market’s most consistent wealth creators. While investors often focus on growth stories in tech or energy, the Atlanta-based retailer has been funneling extraordinary amounts of cash back to its shareholders year after year.
Over the past decade, HD stock has returned a remarkable $130 Bil to its shareholders through tangible returns in the form of dividends and buybacks. Let’s examine some figures and see how this payout capacity compares with the leading capital-returning companies in the market.
Interestingly, HD stock has delivered the 14th highest total to shareholders in history.
Why should you care? Because dividends and share repurchases provide direct, tangible returns of capital to shareholders. They also indicate management’s confidence in the financial stability of the company and its ability to produce sustainable cash flows. There are also other stocks that exhibit similar traits. Here is a ranking of the top 10 companies based on total capital returned to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.
Stock prices can experience volatility, but the markets are not exempt either — 2008, 2020. Fluctuation is part of the equation. Discover how Trefis’ Boston-based wealth management partner managed allocations during both instances.
For the complete ranking, visit Buybacks & Dividends Ranking
What do you observe here? The total capital returned to shareholders as a percentage of the current market capitalization seems inversely proportional to growth potential for reinvestments. Companies such as Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) are expanding much more rapidly and predictably compared to others, yet they have returned a lower proportion of their market cap to shareholders.
That’s the flip side of high capital returns. While they are appealing, you must ask yourself: Am I trading off growth and solid fundamentals? Keeping that in mind, let’s analyze some figures for HD. (Refer to Buy or Sell Home Depot Stock for further information)
This overview is useful, but assessing a stock from an investment outlook requires much more detail. That's precisely what Trefis High Quality Portfolio aims to achieve. It is structured to minimize stock-specific risk while offering potential upside.
Home Depot is not immune to significant sell-offs. It declined around 52% during the Dot-Com Bubble and 54% in the Global Financial Crisis. More recent shocks, such as the 2018 correction and the COVID pandemic, also led to declines of 25% and 38%, respectively. Concerns over inflation resulted in roughly a 35% decrease. Strong fundamentals are significant, but these figures illustrate that even robust stocks can face considerable declines when markets turn adverse.
However, the risk extends beyond major market crashes. Stocks can decrease even in bullish markets — consider events like earnings reports, business updates, and changes in outlook. Review HD Dip Buyer Analyses to learn how the stock has rebounded from sharp declines in the past.
The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a proven track record of consistently outperforming its benchmark, which includes all three indices — the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000. What accounts for this? On the whole, HQ Portfolio stocks have achieved better returns with less risk when compared to the benchmark index; a more stable investment experience, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics."

Narayana Health—the Indian hospital chain founded by billionaire cardiac surgeon Devi Shetty—has agreed to acquire Practice Plus Group Hospitals for £189million ($248 million), marking its first entry into the U.K. market.
The Bangalore-based company, through its unit Narayana Hrudayalaya U.K. will acquire all 60,001 shares, representing a 100% stake in Practice Plus Group, at £3,146 apiece, according to a recent stock exchange filing. 
“Like Narayana Health, Practice Plus Group recognized that the majority of patients were struggling to access healthcare, while only a minority could afford costly private healthcare,” Shetty, chairman of Narayana Health said in a statement. “We have both been working to meet the demands of those in between, and to offer a choice of more accessible private healthcare.”
Practice Plus Group is the fourth-largest provider for the U.K.’s public funded National Health Service (NHS), with NHS patients accounting for 93% of its £229-million revenue in the year ended September 2024. The company projects revenue this year to increase to around £250 million. It operates 10 hospitals and surgical centers with a total of 330 beds and 2,500 employees.
Narayana Health operates 18 hospitals across India with over 5,200 beds, along with one hospital in the Cayman Islands that has 169 beds. The company’s revenue rose 12% to 54.8 billion rupees in the year ended March 2025 compared to the previous year. After the deal is completed, Narayana Health projected that it will be among India’s top three healthcare providers by revenue.
With an estimated net worth of $2.6 billion, Shetty  is among the wealthiest in the country. He founded Narayana Health as Narayana Hrudayalaya in the year 2000 and took the company public in 2015. Biopharma billionaire Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw has a small stake in the company."

Cisco Systems (CSCO)  may not grab headlines like the high-flying tech names of today, but its quiet consistency has made it a powerhouse of shareholder returns. While growth has slowed, the company’s cash-generation machine continues to reward investors handsomely.
Over the past decade, CSCO stock has delivered an astonishing $143 Bil back to its shareholders through solid cash in the form of dividends and buybacks. Let’s examine some figures to see how this payout capability compares to the market's leading capital-return companies.
Interestingly, CSCO stock has provided the 12th most significant amount to shareholders in history.
Why is this important? Because dividends and share repurchases signify direct, tangible returns of capital to shareholders. They also indicate management's confidence in the company's financial stability and ability to maintain sustainable cash flows. Additionally, there are other stocks that follow this trend. Here is a list of the top 10 companies ranked by total capital returned to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.
The investment strategies of Trefis’ Boston-based wealth management partner produced positive results during the 2008-09 period when the S&P dropped over 40%. Our partner has integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio within this asset allocation model to deliver enhanced returns with reduced risk relative to the benchmark index; resulting in a smoother experience, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

What stands out? The total capital returned to shareholders as a percentage of the current market cap seems inversely related to growth potential for reinvestments. Stocks like Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) are rapidly growing in a more predictable manner compared to the others, yet they have returned a significantly smaller proportion of their market cap to shareholders.
That’s the downside to high capital returns. Indeed, they can be appealing, but you must consider: Am I sacrificing growth and sound fundamentals? With this perspective, let’s analyze some data for CSCO. (Refer to Buy or Sell Cisco Systems Stock for further details)
Cisco Systems Fundamentals
That’s a decent summary, but assessing a stock from an investment standpoint requires a lot more. This is exactly what Trefis High Quality Portfolio offers. It aims to minimize stock-specific risks while allowing for potential upside.
CSCO Historical Risk
Cisco is not exempt from significant drops. It experienced a loss of around 86% during the Dot-Com crash and 60% in the Global Financial Crisis. Even more recent shocks have been severe — down 37% during the inflation surge, 34% amid Covid, and nearly 25% in the correction of 2018. A strong company, indeed, but history demonstrates that in major sell-offs, even reliable stocks like Cisco face considerable losses.
The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has a proven track record of consistently outperforming its benchmark, which includes all three indices – the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000.

Fortnite 
Sidekicks seemed like a slam dunk for Fortnite. Add customizable pets that follow you around during matches and impress your friends. What could go wrong? Well, given the way they’ve been implemented in the current Simpsons season, a lot, apparently. One dramatic rallying cry within the community is calling for players to boycott the newest microtransaction opportunity over accusations of “greed.”
There are three main issues. The first is that Sidekicksâa banana dog named Peels went live in the battle pass on November 1âcan only be customized once. After selecting things like size, color, and so on, you can’t go back to change them, forcing you to buy a second Sidekick if you want them to look different. Second, opponents can’t see Sidekicks, only your squadmates. And third, upcoming Sidekicks will be very expensive, at least according to alleged leaks. Some suggest prices as high as 2,800 V-Bucks a piece. Not great!
Hey @Fortnite please make the pricing more reasonable and let us edit our pets to whatever we want and for FREE once we own it.

— Fortnite Leaks | Pluto V2 (@FortnitePV2) October 31, 2025

“Why do I care so much about this?” wrote Mabdog420 on the Fortnite subreddit. “Why not just not buy the sidekicks and shut up about it? Because if we let this go unchecked it will ONLY GET WORSE. Epic always tries to implement predatory pricing or practices like reducing xp gains, and every time we’ve had to fight back to stop it.”
Some players in the comments reported being sent a user survey ahead of Sidekicks officially joining the Fortnite shop on November 7. “How do you feel about having to purchase an additional copy of the same sidekick if you want to customize your sidekick with different features?” it asks. Many are putting “Strongly Dislike” and wondering who on god’s green earth would put anything else.

Others have little faith that the broader Fortnite community will be able to resist, citing the addition of cosmetic shoes a year ago that other players can barely see but that enough people are seemingly spending real money to buy anyway. “I still find the shoes a bigger scam than this,” one player wrote. The ongoing trend is making some fans lose hope.
“Like someone who started pretty early in the game it makes me so sad to see what this has become,” another player wrote. “Itâs like Once-ler in the Lorax but a game, to where we have to fight a metaphorical war just to get fair treatment. then having to settle with the plain oatmeal that they give us thatâs just slightly tastier then all the other brands on the market so thatâs why we stay. Itâs just so tiring and such a depressing way for a gaming company to be seen and be ran.”

Every investor is guided by a foundational principle: that a broadly diversified portfolio is the best way to build wealth. It is the conventional wisdom, the first commandment of finance. Diversification is also the path to mediocrity.
The truth is, the very thing designed to protect you—diversification—is actually the largest barrier to achieving outsized wealth.
The empirical truth of the stock market tells a dramatic story. A landmark study by Bessembinder revealed the market’s deepest secret: nearly 97% of stocks underperform simple Treasury bills after costs. Digging deeper, shares of half of all publicly traded companies fail to create any wealth at all.
This means the entire, massive, multi-trillion dollar stock market is a vast ocean of mediocrity, driven by a tiny, precious 3% handful of outlier winners.
The reality is the investment industry has successfully weaponized behavioral biases. Fear of loss and the stress of volatility shove billions of dollars toward the comfort of broad, managed diversification. This is why the Exchange Traded Fund market in the United States alone is valued at over $11.5 trillion.
Diversification is a brilliant defense against catastrophic loss, but it’s the surest path to average performance, or worse. By casting a wide net, you dilute your exposure to the few, rare titans that are generating virtually all the gains. You own the entire desert, not the oasis of winners.
Achieving truly superior gains requires a willingness to defy this comfortable norm. It demands the conviction to search for and aggressively own shares of that 3% subset: the companies winning the most important secular trends of our time.
Consider the birth of cloud computing. When Amazon Web Services publicly launched in 2006, it was the start of a multi-decade, global trend. Our strategy at Markman Capital has been unwavering and highly successful because we recognized this. Nearly two decades later, AWS is stronger than ever, a compounding engine that exemplifies the kind of winning stock Bessembinder identified.
The path to outperformance requires discipline and selectivity. It means overcoming the fear that the financial services ecosystem sells. To beat the market, you must be willing to take calculated, concentrated risks and, most critically, have the fortitude to hold those winners through inevitable downturns.
True wealth growth is not a passive activity; it is a disciplined act of selection and conviction. The key is recognizing that while 97% of the market is noise, the only thing that matters is owning the 3% that drives the signal.

Over the past few years, specifically with the launch of the Pixel 7 series it would appear, Google has been chipping away at Samsung’s US smartphone marketshare. According to a recent study from Counterpoint Research that looked at carrier-specific data, in September of 2022, Google had a 0.1% share of the $600+ market. Fast forward to September of 2025, that share has risen to 6.1% on T-Mobile. On Verizon, it’s even higher.
While Apple hasn’t felt the effect of this growth, Samsung certainly has. Apple’s share in that same timespan grew from 72% to 80%. Apple is doing just fine. Samsung, on the other hand, fell from 26% to only 12%. It appears that whatever marketing Google is doing, people are making the switch in healthy bunches year over year.

Marketing mumbo jumbo aside, I would argue that the phones themselves are simply getting better. Sure, Gemini is cool, but the hardware is right on par with the software now. The Pixel 9 and Pixel 10 lineup are sexy phones, accompanied by great camera systems and plenty of software smarts. Overall, they’re good phones, however you want to break it down.
This marketshare shakeup could be the reason behind Samsung’s reported desire to switch up its lineup. We’ve heard rumblings of a Galaxy S26 Pro, plus there was talks of the Galaxy S26 Edge replacing the Galaxy S26+. That didn’t last long, though.
Keep doing what you’re doing, Google.

78,2025-11-03,"Chevrolet is probably the most popular brand when it comes to crate engines, often being a go-to brand for engine swaps. The Chevy small-block 350 is the most successful crate engine ever made. While they mostly focus on affordable everyday motors, they also make high-performance engines, like the much-loved LS7.
Now, some special engines come with a hefty price tag. Following this trend, an LT4 motor tuned by Late Model Engines, like the one you'd find the C7 Corvette Z06, the Camaro ZL1, and the Cadillac CTS-V, was sold for an astounding $40,250 on Bring a Trailer. For reference, that's not too far off the average car price in the U.S., which currently sits at around $50,000. You could even get a well-equipped Toyota RAV4 Hybrid XSE trim for a little less than $40,000.
In stock form, the 6.2-liter LT4 V8 produces 650 horsepower and 650 lb-ft of torque, but this is no ordinary LT4. LME has fettled with its internals, and as tested, it registers a tire-ripping 821 horsepower and 797 lb-ft of torque on the dyno. LME is a performance engine manufacturer based out of Texas, specializing in high-performance Chevrolet-based V8s, offering all kinds of engine-related tuning. They are known for their CNC-ported cylinder heads for various engines, allowing them to fine-tune airflow and compression ratios for specific applications.
Engines commanding such high prices are usually race-prepped units, built for bulletproof durability while adhering to strict racing stipulations, like GM's LSX crate engine. However, what makes this motor truly special is that it runs on pump gas. Usually, engines producing this kind of power require high-octane racing fuel, but LME has tuned this LT4 to produce 821 horsepower on standard 93-octane pump gas, which is quite rare for an engine not running a bunch of turbos.
Special engines require special construction, and LME has done much more than turn up the boost. For starters, the engine is precision-bored to 4.070 inches. It's also equipped with some of the best components available for LT engines: a Callies forged crankshaft with Texas Speed I-beam connecting rods, Diamond 2K forged pistons, and ARP 2000 bolts.
No custom build is complete without a performance camshaft. LME has used a custom-ground Cam Motion unit with 244/252 duration. It also features Brian Tooley .660 lift valve springs and Johnson 2116LSR tie-bar lifters. LME equipped the LT4 with a GripTec 2.30-inch upper pulley on a ZPE hub and a DSX 9.06-inch lower pulley to manage the added boost. 
The factory supercharger stays in place, but it benefits from new bearings, fresh oil, and a larger 103mm throttle body opening. Fuel is delivered through upgraded fuel injectors obtained from the Fuel Injector Connection. Lastly, it also features a billet timing chain, timing cover, and titanium valve retainers from Late Model Engines. The team also ported the cylinder heads and supercharger to improve airflow efficiency."

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

AMVR makes some of my all-time favorite Meta Quest accessories, and now they're jumping into the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses accessory market too. I got this charger the other day and was pleased to find out that it works with both Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 and Gen 2 smart glasses, and now it's on sale for a few bucks off at Amazon, making it just over $30. 
Why get a charging dock when the glasses already have a charging case? The answer is so that you never run into a situation where both your glasses and the charging case run out of battery. This ingenious little dock makes it simple to drop your glasses and the case on the dock the moment you walk in your front door and then pick them up again from a convenient location on your way out.
Celebrate the launch of the AMVR Ray-Ban Meta charging dock with a 10% off coupon on Amazon! This handy charger will keep your glasses and the charging case fully charged at all times, ensuring you never end up with a dead battery while on the go.
As part of my testing I checked to see how long it would take for both the glasses and the case to charge while on the dock at the same time. I found that the charger is a few minutes faster to hit both 50% and 100% charge for each the glasses and the case. That means if your glasses end up with a dead battery when you walk in the door it only takes 17 minutes to hit a 50% charge. That's just enough to last for quite some time if you find yourself out and about for a few hours and still want to carry your glasses with you.
The front of the dock has a nose piece clip that looks essentially identical to what you'll find inside of the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses charging case. The glasses click nicely into place and a charging LED on the front of the dock lets you know that your glasses are charging by turning from green to red. Once the glasses are all charged up, that same LED will turn green. There's a second LED next to it to show the status of the charging case and each of these LEDs has a handy symbol above it so that you never are guessing which LED goes to which device
Popping the charging case into the dock is just as simple thanks to a clever magnetic USB-C connector that ships in the box. AMVR even includes a second one of these in the box just in case you lose the first one, which is always a possibility given how small these little dongles are. I've used these kinds of magnetic charging docks with my Meta Quest in the past and it's amazing how handy it is to just be able to drop the case on the dock and have it charge. It's like a wireless charging magnetic connector for your phone except in this case it's purpose built for the Ray-Ban Meta charging case.
Well this one does work with all generations of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, it doesn't work with Oakley Meta smart glasses or the Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses. Those cases are not the right size and shape and they simply won't fit on the dock, although they will charge Oakley Meta HSTN glasses if you happen to have a pair of those. Just not the large charging case that comes with those glasses.
There aren't too many accessories for the smart glasses just yet but clever manufacturers like AMVR well no doubt come up with more ideas as we get more of these products. AMVR in particular makes some of my favorite Meta Quest accessories and I have no doubt that they will continue to talk the list of Ray-Ban Meta accessories as time passes.

Meta may have a big head start in the smart glasses field right now, but that doesn’t mean it’s got the form factor figured out. While its Ray-Bans have leaned into AI and computer vision through an onboard camera, other entrants in the field don’t seem convinced that smart glasses need a camera at all. Case in point? Lenovo.
The maker of the ThinkPad just released its first pair of smart glasses, the V1, which come with a micro LED screen and are almost impossibly light. Lenovo says its smart glasses weigh just 38g, which makes them 10 to 14g lighter than the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 and Gen 2 AI glasses and about 30g lighter than the Meta Ray-Ban Display. Though 10g (in the case of Meta’s non-display glasses) may not seem like a big difference, it’s worth remembering that these are worn on your face, so every gram counts. Plus, the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses don’t have a screen.
As I alluded to before, there is a small caveat to that impressive weight, though. Lenovo’s V1 glasses, notably, do not come equipped with a camera, which could be a dealbreaker for some. Anyone looking to use smart glasses to capture video hands-free while biking or playing sports wouldn’t get much use out of the V1. Likewise, anyone interested in the computer vision part of smart glasses (i.e., capabilities powered by Meta AI, which can translate text and answer questions about objects you’re looking at) would be disappointed here.
That being said, a lack of a camera may not be a dealbreaker for everyone. Other companies in the smart glasses space, like Even Realities, have also sacrificed cameras for improvements in weight and to better cater to those concerned about the privacy implications of discreetly recording your surroundings. In the end, smart glasses might be more about the screen than all the other stuff, and on that front, Lenovo is off to a fairly decent start. The V1 claims 2,000 nits of brightness, which wouldn’t make it the brightest display in the world, but it isn’t slouching either (the Meta Ray-Ban Display has a max brightness of 5,000 nits). The display is a monochrome micro LED, like those in many other smart glasses on the market, and can be used in monocular or binocular modes (one or both eyes).
And no cameras doesn’t mean no AI, either. Lenovo is integrating its own voice assistant, which enables real-time translation, voice commands, and voice queries. LikeÂ Rokid glasses, these also include a teleprompter mode that lets you use the glasses’Â display for presentations.
If anything, Lenovo’s V1 is just further proof that makers of smart glasses are still testing the waters regarding what features and hardware consumers find critical, and whether they value weight and form over certain functions. If you’re dying to find out for yourself, Lenovo’s V1 glasses are available for preorder now for about $560 with an official release date of Nov. 9, though the launch is clearly geared toward the Chinese market for now.

          Meta's first pair of smart glasses with a display made me ask a lot of questions, and I'm not sure I like the potential answers.
        

          Smart glassses have a lot to offer, but AI needs to get out of the way.
        

          Can all the smart glasses upstarts survive the impending AR explosion?
        

          Oh, and Google is in on the action, too.
        

          Smart glasses may have a repairability problem.
        

          Alibaba's new smart glasses are undercutting Meta's Ray-Ban Display glasses by a significant margin.

Forbes Staff.
A bump in Amazon's stock price Monday fueled by the news OpenAI had signed a $38 billion cloud computing deal with the retail giant bumped company founder Jeff Bezos’ estimated net worth roughly $10 billion in a single day, adding to the billions he gained following a strong earnings report from Amazon last week. 
Shares of Amazon were up more than 4% on Monday afternoon following news earlier in the day that Amazon Web Services had secured a seven-year OpenAI contract to provide the computing power needed for its artificial intelligence technologies. 
Bezos, who founded Amazon out of his Seattle garage in 1994, holds 8% equity in Amazon and saw his net worth rise $9.8 billion, more than 3.8%, as of Monday afternoon.
Bezos’ wealth jumped $19.4 billion on Friday thanks to a surge that took Amazon shares to a record high after the company reported $180.2 billion in revenues and earnings per share of $1.95, growth that beat Wall Street’s expectations and CEO Andy Jassy attributed largely to Amazon Web Services.

Bezos is worth an estimated $264.1 billion as of around 3:20 p.m. EST on Monday. In addition to his 8% stake in Amazon, he owns the Washington Post and Blue Origin, an aerospace company. 
OpenAI was locked into a contract with Microsoft, its primary investor, that required it to get all of its computing power from the company from 2019 to 2023. When OpenAI outgrew what Microsoft could provide, it was allowed to sign deals with two other cloud companies. That changed last week, when Microsoft and OpenAI renegotiated their contract to allow the AI company to purchase cloud services on the open market. That same restructuring change allowed OpenAI to establish a for-profit arm valued at $500 billion. The deal with Amazon comes on the heels of others with Nvidia, Broadcom, Oracle and Google.  "

Julie Lennox's fascination with tiny homes began after she tore her ACL downhill skiing in 2019.
During her long recovery from knee surgery, she spent many hours rehabbing on a stationary bike while watching a YouTube series called ""Living Big in a Tiny House."" Lennox, 59, was captivated by the tours of postage-stamp-sized homes, and by how creative and cost-effective the lifestyle seemed.
""It made me a little bit obsessed with tiny homes,"" she said. ""It just seemed like a cool way to have a smaller footprint in the world.""
But she didn't think seriously about shrinking her own footprint until 2021, when she and her former partner split up and sold their three-bedroom house in Missoula, Montana.
A surge in demand for housing across the Mountain West had sent home values skyrocketing in Missoula, and Lennox couldn't afford much on the market. So she moved in with her parents on their 15-acre property just outside the city and began planning to build her own tiny home in their backyard.
Lennox, the head of a local private school in Missoula, eventually settled on a prefabricated mobile tiny home built and delivered to her by a Canadian company, Teacup Tiny Homes, in 2022. Unlike a regular tiny home, the structure was built on a trailer chassis and sits permanently on wheels, so it can be towed and relocated to a different piece of land if needed.
The tiny home on wheels, also known as a THOW, has allowed Lennox to significantly reduce her housing costs over the last three years. It's also enabled her to live next door to her parents, whom she cooks dinner for almost every night, while giving her the flexibility to move the home if she ever wants to. She's among a growing number of Americans, including older people who are downsizing, who are choosing this alternative form of housing.
Perhaps the biggest upside of the move has been the cost savings.
Lennox spent 191,000 Canadian dollars, which was about $146,000 at the time, buying the home. She estimates she spent another $15,000 installing a pad for the structure to sit on, building a porch around it, and hooking it up to water, sewer, and electricity. She didn't take out a mortgage; she used the cash from her home sale to cover all of her costs.
These days, her housing costs are limited to utilities and home repairs, the latter of which she estimates she's spent less than $500 on over the last three years.
Because the home is so small, Lennox said she spends only about $600 a year on propane, which she uses for cooking, to heat her home and water, and to power her dryer. She hooked her home up to her parents' electricity, which powers the pump for her well water and keeps the lights on. While her parents cover the electricity bill, Lennox said her costs are quite low. In exchange, Lennox pays the Starlink Internet bill for her parents, her sister, and herself, which is $100 a month.
This brings her average monthly housing costs to less than $200.
But there's been a learning curve associated with tiny living. She's had to adjust to removing and refilling her propane tank regularly — every five or six weeks in the winter — and making sure to leave her taps dripping in the winter to prevent her pipes from freezing.
And her move required a fair amount of downsizing. But Lennox says that, these days, she doesn't miss any of her old stuff. And she's able to store some large things, like her skis and bicycles, in her parents' garage.
She shares her home with her dog, Rizzo, a 10-year-old labradoodle. It's just enough space for the two of them.
""I think if it were more than one person, that would feel a little more challenging,"" she said.
The quarters also feel a bit more cramped when it's cold out. ""The winters can be a little bit harder because it is such a small space, and so I feel a little more closed in,"" Lennox said.
Her living space is larger in the warmer months, as she spends much of her time outside on her porch, surrounded by Ponderosa pines and Douglas-fir trees, with a view of the Blackfoot River.
""Sometimes I feel more like I'm camping than I am living in my house,"" she said.

When people talk about open-concept homes, they rave about how easy they make entertaining or how lovely it is to be able to see their entire living area as they prepare dinner.
They don't mention the fact that all of your dirty dishes are visible when you're hosting a party, that they can make it impossible to read in your dining area when someone else is watching TV on the couch, or that if one item is left out on the counter, it might be distracting to your eye.
Open-concept floor plans were all the rage in home design for a while, becoming a staple on home-improvement shows and on aesthetically pleasing Instagram feeds. However, the style has become less popular in recent years as people instead gravitate toward more distinct spaces that better serve their day-to-day needs.
Business Insider spoke to interior-design experts about why the change is happening and how people can create more distinction in their open spaces.
Professionals in the design world pointed to the fact that open-concept homes aren't always ideal for day-to-day living as the reason behind the shift away from the design style, as became evident when people started working remotely.
""We love that sense of openness and airiness, and yet when we were all stuck in our homes all the time with our significant others, we all kind of had that sense of, 'How do you carve out privacy and a sense of your own space in a home?'"" Heather Goerzen, the director of content and design at Havenly, a company that partners people with interior designers, told Business Insider. 
""All of our homes that became one big open room were suddenly not conducive to living,"" Rachel Stults, the managing editor at Realtor.com, echoed to Business Insider. ""It created a desire to have a defined space, or at least the ability to close one off if you need to.""
Now, many people are craving more definition in their homes, with some going so far as to literally build new rooms to create that sense of separation.
""We have seen people put up more definition if they can by putting up walls or looking for homes that have a closed-off kitchen or a closed-off dining room,"" Stults said.
Dan Mazzarini, the creative director at BHDM Design and an expert in both interior design and home staging, told Business Insider it's particularly important to think about how to break up your open-concept space if you're staging your home for sale, as you want to show potential buyers the multitude of ways they can use the area.
""You might have used your house one way, but ask your broker for their point of view about what people are looking for in this kind of market and in that kind of open-concept space,"" he said. 
If you don't want to move or physically add walls to your home, there are plenty of ways to break up your space using decor accessories or furniture you already have, as the designers told Business Insider. 
When breaking up an open-concept home, you want to visually display that different parts of the space can have different functions, Mazzarini told Business Insider.
""People need to understand how they can use the space,"" he said.
The designers said one easy way to create separate areas within a home was to use the furniture to literally break it up.
For instance, instead of placing your couch against a wall, you can put it in the center of a room to separate it from the dining area, or you can use a console table to act as a barrier that breaks up the living area and the kitchen. 
Goerzen said you could also use rugs to delineate space and show different functions in a room.
""A different corresponding or complementary rug in your living space versus your dining space can kind of anchor those two,"" she said. 
If you want more separation, Goerzen recommended using furniture with more height, such as a bookshelf or even a folding screen, to create privacy within spaces.
Not everyone loves the look of that height when breaking up a space, though, so you might have to go through some trial and error before you find the solution that works for you.
Focus on what you want the different parts of the room to do, and you'll end up with a more thought-out space.

The first time I swiped my EBT card at the grocery store, I resolved to use the self-checkout line so I could be discreet.
We just need milk, I told myself.
But as I perused the aisles, a strange lightness overwhelmed me. For the first time in months, I wasn't clenching my jaw at every purchase that chipped away at our savings.
By the time I reached the registers, my cart was full. Still, I chose the self-checkout line, rationalizing that it wasn't a busy hour. When I went to pay, the screen asked me how many 10-cent grocery bags I needed. I paused for a moment, wondering if I'd have to use a different payment method for the bags. The person manning the check-out stations in case anyone needed help — a kind employee I'd known for years — waved her hand in my direction. ""Oh, honey. EBT users don't have to pay for bags.""
My face flushed. ""Thank you,"" I stammered.
From then on, for a time, the most embarrassing moment of my week became swiping that card and watching ""SNAP benefits"" appear on the cashier's screen, especially when I knew some of the grocers by name.
They never said anything to me, but I think they wanted to. My favorite grocer looked at me one day and asked, ""How are you doing?"" in a concerned voice after he swiped my card. Others offered me sad smiles or reassuring words like, ""Hang in there, Mama.""
I didn't tell them what was going on. Instead, I found myself purposefully choosing a new cashier or a different store just to avoid the stigma of needing assistance.
My husband and I come from hardworking, middle-class families. We've always been careful with money — bills paid on time, no credit card debt, and a small savings account for emergencies.
But then he was laid off in the spring of 2023 when I was 12 weeks postpartum, and I'd just left my part-time job to stay home with our third baby. Our sole income disappeared overnight.
We stretched what we had by cutting costs, skipping extras, and living on inexpensive homemade meals. But our savings didn't last forever.
For seven months, my husband applied to at least one opportunity per day — a total of more than 200. He went through many application portals, pre-screenings, and interviews. We waited weeks between promising panel interviews, only to learn he didn't get a position after coming so close. And he was ghosted — a lot — even by hiring managers who promised to get back to him by a certain date.
I also started looking for a remote job that I could do with an infant at home and took on some side work.
We were doing everything we could. So when a snarky social media post suggested that anyone on SNAP should just download the Indeed app, get a job, and use that to pay for groceries, I winced. If only it were that simple.
We finally admitted we could use some government support. The process was surprisingly thorough and rigorous — they wanted to see bank statements, verify income, and interview us to understand our situation. I spent a frustrating number of hours on the application, including multiple long phone calls.
It made me realize how many misconceptions exist about who qualifies. This wasn't a handout for anyone who asked, but for people genuinely struggling. And right now, we were those people. 
I never thought we'd need SNAP benefits — until we did. Accepting help broke down my pride and taught me that this safety net exists for a reason. And while it was hard for me to admit that we needed that help, especially at the beginning, I'm also grateful for the temporary relief that SNAP benefits provided to my family. 
As soon as we could stand on our two feet again, we did, and I even returned the remaining balance left on our card.
We weren't lazy or looking for a crutch. We just needed a little help while we rebuilt.

Today, in the Real Estate Newsletter: Asking Rents Mostly Unchanged Year-over-year
Brief excerpt: Another monthly update on rents.

Tracking rents is important for understanding the dynamics of the housing market. Slower household formation and increased supply (more multi-family completions) has kept asking rents under pressure.

More recently, immigration policy has become a negative for rentals.

Apartment List: Asking Rent Growth -0.9% Year-over-year ...The national median rent dipped by 0.8% in October, and now stands at $1,381. This was the third consecutive month-over-month decline, as we’re now in the midst of the rental market’s off-season. It’s likely that we’ll continue to see further modest rent declines to close out the year.Realtor.com: 26th Consecutive Month with Year-over-year Decline in RentsSeptember 2025 marks the 26th straight month of year-over-year rent decline for 0-2 bedroom properties since trend data began in 2020. Asking rents dipped by $36, or -2.1%, year over year.There is much more in the article.

87,2025-11-03,"The price of TON$2.0396 dropped 5% in 24 hours to $2.165 as market pressure intensified and Nasdaq reprimanded TON Strategy over a $272.7 million purchase of the token.
The price broke through key support zones on the way down, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model. Trading volumes surged to 5.76 million tokens, nearly 1.5 times the 24-hour average, confirming strong selling conviction.
A brief late-session bounce helped TON recover from its $2.162 low, but resistance near $2.19 capped the rebound. The wider crypto market, as measured via the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index, dropped 3.7% in the last 24 hours.
TON’s underperformance also came amid a reprimand from Nasdaq on one of the largest holders of the token.
TON Strategy (TONX), the largest publicly listed firm building a toncoin treasury, failed to obtain required shareholder approval before issuing stock to finance a large token acquisition, according to an Oct. 28 SEC filing.
The deal, structured as a private investment in public equity (PIPE), used nearly half the proceeds, about $273 million, to purchase toncoin.
Nasdaq flagged the rule violation but stopped short of recommending delisting, citing no apparent intent to evade compliance. Still, the warning adds pressure to TON Strategy’s broader effort to legitimize a public treasury focusing on the cryptocurrency. TON Strategy currently holds 217.5 million tokens.
TON's price action is now being driven largely by technical levels. Support appears to be forming near $2.162, while resistance at $2.19 may continue to cap upside attempts.

Zenfolio has expanded its NextZen platform to help photographers confidently enter the growing volume photography market. With new AI-powered tools and streamlined workflows, studios can now manage large-scale shoots, deliver galleries faster, and offer a professional client experience without added stress.
Photographers looking to grow their business and explore new revenue streams are increasingly turning to volume photography, high-efficiency sessions where hundreds or thousands of individuals are photographed in a short period. Zenfolio’s newly expanded NextZen platform is explicitly designed to meet this demand, offering tools that simplify the most challenging parts of volume photography: organizing, delivering, and managing massive numbers of images without sacrificing quality or personal touch.

Developed over two years with input from working photographers, NextZen introduces innovative features such as QR Code Workflow and Face Finder, powered by Zenfolio’s AI technology. These tools allow photographers to tag, sort, and share galleries in hours rather than weeks. QR Code Workflow ensures that each student, athlete, or participant is automatically linked to their images on picture day, eliminating errors and reducing the manual work that can slow down delivery. Meanwhile, Face Finder lets clients locate themselves in action or team shots using a simple selfie, streamlining the ordering experience while respecting privacy and consent laws.
“Volume photography is one of the fastest-growing segments in our industry, but it comes with unique challenges that can overwhelm even experienced photographers,” says John Loughlin, CEO of Zenfolio. 
“With NextZen’s Volume offering, we enable photographers to capture new revenue streams and expand their businesses without sacrificing quality, efficiency, or client satisfaction.”
Volume photography demands precision, speed, and consistency, whether shooting school picture days, sports teams, dance recitals, or corporate events. Success depends on balancing skill with workflow efficiency, and Zenfolio’s latest expansion reflects a deep understanding of these needs. The company spent years collaborating with photographers and clients to refine workflows, tools, and technology, producing a platform that simplifies organization, improves client communication, and ensures seamless image delivery.

The platform’s all-in-one solution covers every step of a volume photography workflow. Photographers can import rosters, tag participants, deliver organized galleries, and sell products online, all from a single system. Automated tools such as bulk gallery creation and AI-powered Selfie Search reduce repetitive tasks, giving studios more time to focus on capturing quality images while accelerating client delivery.
NextZen also supports growth with lab fulfillment for print and digital products, making it simple for photographers to offer customized prints, framed products, and digital downloads. By combining workflow automation with professional-quality output, Zenfolio promises to enable photographers to scale their business while maintaining a high standard of client experience.



Zenfolio states that privacy and compliance are key priorities for its AI features, and that its Face Finder feature requires customers to log in and provide consent first. Additionally, they can request the deletion of their uploaded photo at any time. 
“Zenfolio does not use or store biometric data beyond what’s required for image search functionality,” Zenfolio says. “Photographers have full control over whether AI based face search is enabled on a gallery. The system also respects location-based privacy laws, such as biometric data restrictions in states like Illinois.”

As artificial intelligence advancements become mainstream, Zenfolio mentions that it is developing a robust roadmap to further enhance volume photography workflows. Future updates will include features for job management, ordering, and client engagement, using AI to reduce repetitive tasks without replacing the creative work of the photographer.
With its combination of advanced AI technology, automated workflows, and professional fulfillment, Zenfolio’s NextZen platform promises to make volume photography approachable for both new and established studios. Photographers can confidently take on high-volume assignments, from schools and sports to events, while increasing revenue and ensuring a seamless, professional experience for every client.
Zenfolio’s NextZen platform is available now, priced at $20 per month (usually $40/month), ProSuite plans include the full suite of professional tools designed to streamline volume-based workflows, expand services, and boost studio efficiency.

93,2025-11-03,"British architect Piers Taylor advocates a radically local approach to contemporary architecture in his book, Learning from the Local. In this roundup, he picks 10 featured projects that embody the idea.
Published with the Royal Institute of British Architects, the book by Invisible Studio founder Taylor encourages the design of more contextual architecture that is responsive to local climate, communities and culture.
It features more than 30 case studies to exemplify this philosophy, including the work by renowned architects Frank Gehry, Glen Murcutt and Diébédo Francis Kéré.
Taylor said that his call for more local architectural design is not a ""romantic plea"" for pre-industrial or vernacular architecture, rather one for ""radically contemporary"" ways of embedding projects into their local context.
""It isn't so much a manifesto, but it is a call to all of us who care about the built environment to move beyond the shallow comfort of imitation and engage with a deeper, messier work,"" Taylor told Dezeen.
""The book has no examples of projects that call themselves vernacular,"" he explained.
According to the architect, the eclectic mix of projects in the book, which vary in style, typology and scale, demonstrates how the ""beauty"" of a project is determined by its connection to its context.
""What this book does is show what buildings can look like if they draw on these ecological, social, cultural and material networks,"" Taylor said.
""What I hope the book does is give people ammunition that it is possible to invent new ways of doing things that are simultaneously rooted in local conditions,"" Taylor added. ""What you need to look at is quite literally the territory and the networks that your project sits within and draw on those things,"" he added.
However, Taylor also highlighted that adopting this more local approach to architecture would require the industry to relinquish some control in the design process.
""What needs to change radically is actually the mindset of architects,"" he said. ""Unless we challenge how buildings are procured and conceived culturally by architects, we will end up with faceless, homogenised infrastructure that is in the pocket of power, money and politics.""
Read on for Taylor's pick of 10 key projects from Learning from the Local:
Gando Primary School by Diébédo Francis Kéré
""Francis Kéré's Gando Primary School in Burkina Faso transforms the most modest resources into architectural intelligence.
""Built with local earth, shaped by community hands and ventilated through a double roof of clay and steel, it demonstrates that climatic logic and social engagement are inseparable. Kéré's process – training local workers, refining traditional techniques – aligns perfectly with Learning from the Local's theme of ecological embeddedness and social authorship.
""The building's elegance lies not in its form but in its collective making, showing that truly sustainable architecture grows from reciprocity, not technology.""

East Quay by Invisible Studio and Ellis Williams Architects 
""In Watchet, Somerset, East Quay shows what happens when architecture is led by community ambition rather than developer vision.
""Conceived by the local social enterprise Onion Collective and designed collaboratively with Invisible Studio and Ellis Williams Architects, it combines artists' studios, workshops, galleries, and accommodation in a building governed and owned by the town.
""The project exemplifies Learning from the Local's emphasis on participation as form – where locality arises from governance, not just geometry. East Quay's eccentric collage of volumes mirrors the diversity of its authorship, proving that belonging can emerge through collective will, civic imagination, and the courage to build differently.""

Reggio School by Andrés Jaque and the Office for Political Innovation
""Designed by Andrés Jaque and the Office for Political Innovation, the Reggio School in Madrid redefines what it means for a building to be local.
""Constructed from a range of local materials, including cork harvested nearby, surplus windows and repurposed components, it embeds itself within the ecological and industrial systems of its region.
""Rather than concealing complexity, the school makes material provenance visible – pipes, ducts, and reused surfaces become part of its aesthetic and its teaching. In the spirit of Learning from the Local, the project turns sustainability into storytelling: the building itself becomes a teacher, showing pupils how matter, waste, and energy circulate through the world.""

House in an Olive Grove by Invisible Studio
""In the terraced Venetian landscape of Corfu, House in an Olive Grove is an act of resistance against the Mediterranean cliché of polished villas and imported style.
""Built without removing a single olive tree, the house is not an object in the landscape but a piece of landscape infrastructure – a simple platform for living, working, and change.
""Its in-situ concrete, textured with reused formwork and with olive stones, records the rhythms of place and the sensibility of local builders. The house offers a different model of cultural sustainability – rooted in material immediacy, and the reciprocity between people, climate, and place.""

Ningbo Museum by Wang Shu
""Wang Shu's Ningbo History Museum redefines regionalism for the contemporary city. Built using thousands of reclaimed bricks and tiles from demolished villages, it weaves fragments of the local past into a monumental civic form.
""The project's layered walls and varied textures evoke the city's rapid transformation while grounding it in continuity. In the language of Learning from the Local, this is architecture as dialogue – between tradition and modernity, handcraft and urban scale.
""It shows that the local can operate not only at the domestic or rural scale but also as a powerful civic gesture of remembrance.""

Sanjaynagar Slum Redevelopment by Community Design Agency
""The Sanjaynagar project replaces informal settlements with permanent housing built through intense community participation.
""Residents co-design their homes, deciding layouts, materials, and shared spaces. The result is architecture that reflects lived experience rather than imposed ideals.
""It exemplifies Learning from the Local's commitment to community authorship and incremental transformation. By embedding empowerment in design and construction, Sanjaynagar turns 'slum clearance' into civic renewal, proving that social justice and architectural intelligence are not opposites but allies.""

Stock Orchard Street by Sarah Wigglesworth and Jeremy Till 
""Designed by Sarah Wigglesworth and Jeremy Till, Stock Orchard Street in London transforms a tight urban site into a living experiment in sustainable design.
""Combining a home and an architectural practice, it uses straw bales, sandbags, timber, and recycled materials – all exposed, celebrated, and imperfect.
""The building embodies the book's theme of ecology as praxis, demonstrating that sustainability is a lived condition, not an aesthetic. By blurring boundaries between domestic and professional, hand-made and high-tech, Stock Orchard Street argues for an architecture of the everyday – inventive, humane, and deeply local.""

 Flying Mud Boat by Terunobu Fujimori
""Japanese architect Terunobu Fujimori's work – treehouses, tea rooms, charred-wood pavilions – celebrates the poetic, eccentric, and local in equal measure.
""His architecture reclaims vernacular traditions through humour and experimentation, showing that the local can be both serious and surreal.
""Using natural materials such as earth, bark, and timber, Fujimori's projects exemplify what Learning from the Local calls identity beyond borders – rooted in place yet liberated from convention. His buildings suggest that learning from the local need not be earnest or nostalgic; it can be mischievous, sensual, and joyfully strange.""
Amateur Studio by Invisible Studio
""Amateur Studio is a self-built research space exploring how architectural knowledge can emerge directly from material engagement.
""Constructed using locally sourced timber and salvaged components, it embodies the book's central argument that architecture is not a product but a process. Built without drawings and refined through improvisation, the project challenges hierarchies between designer and maker, theory and practice.
""It is learning from the local in the most literal sense – using what is at hand, responding to weather, terrain, and resourcefulness. The result is less an aesthetic statement than an ongoing experiment in autonomy, care, and making as thinking.""
Atcost by Clancy Moore Architects
""Atcost reimagines a disused concrete-framed farm building as a contemporary live-work home, turning an anonymous agricultural structure into a model of rural adaptation.
""Rather than erasing its utilitarian past, the project retains the raw frame and inserts lightweight living spaces within it. It demonstrates how rural architecture can evolve without nostalgia, working with existing material cultures rather than against them.
""The transformation foregrounds the book's theme of constraint as opportunity – using the discipline of reuse to generate invention. Atcost belongs to its place not through imitation, but through an ethic of resourcefulness and respect for what already exists.""

Welcome to a new creative space at Yanko Design, where we explore the minds behind the products that shape our world. We are thrilled to introduce our new podcast, Design Mindset, your weekly dive into the philosophies and frameworks that drive modern innovation. Every Friday, host Radhika Seth sits down with leaders, creators, and thinkers who are redefining their industries. In our ninth episode, we explore a fascinating concept: the invisible grid. These are the seamless systems and technologies that, when designed perfectly, fade into the background, allowing pure creativity to flourish without constraint.
Our guest for this exploration is Edward Mao, a product design lead and the head of the integrated design department at Insta360. Edward brings a global perspective to his work, having studied and lived across the US, Sweden, and Schengen. He leads teams that build the very systems millions of creators depend on daily. Insta360 is known for its groundbreaking 360-degree cameras and action cameras, particularly its “invisible selfie stick” technology, which serves as a perfect metaphor for our conversation. The best systems, like the best tools, should empower the user to the point where they are no longer thinking about the tool itself, but only about what they want to create.

What truly separates an innovator from a follower? According to Edward, it transcends simple risk-taking and digs deep into one’s fundamental mindset. An innovator is driven by a desire to establish entirely new rules, to create categories that never existed before, and to set the benchmarks that will define the market for years to come. Their focus is on impact and purpose, a relentless pursuit of a unique vision that pushes the entire industry forward. Edward explains that this path is inherently harder, but the reward is a profound sense of satisfaction that cannot be replicated. As he puts it, “innovating makes you unique… the payoff, you can get the sense of purpose, the sense of satisfaction, right? It’s way bigger than the comfort of staying safe.” It’s a conscious choice to author the next chapter rather than simply editing a page in someone else’s book.
Conversely, the follower’s path is often a strategic one, focused on efficiency and execution. They excel at optimizing proven formulas and competing on established metrics like price and features, a strategy that allows them to catch up quickly and capture market share. However, this approach has a natural limit. Edward notes that many successful creators and companies eventually hit a “growth ceiling,” a point where the old formulas no longer yield the same results. This is the critical juncture where the question shifts from “How can we do this better?” to “What’s next?” This moment of stagnation often becomes the catalyst for a radical shift in thinking, forcing even the most dedicated follower to consider the daunting but necessary leap into the unknown territory of innovation, where the potential for true differentiation lies.

The ultimate goal of great design is to render itself invisible. This is the central philosophy Edward champions, where technology becomes so intuitive and seamless that it dissolves into the background, leaving only the user and their creative vision. The tool ceases to be an object of focus and instead becomes a natural extension of the user’s intent. Insta360’s “invisible selfie stick” is the perfect embodiment of this principle. When a creator uses it, they are not thinking about the pole in their hand or the mechanics of the software erasing it. They are thinking about capturing an impossible, drone-like shot, fully immersed in the act of creation. This is the magic moment Edward strives for, when “the tech basically disappears and the creativity takes over… that’s when you know you have built something truly invisible.” The technology becomes a silent partner, empowering the user without ever demanding their attention.
Achieving this level of invisibility is not a matter of adding more features, but of ruthless simplification and a return to first principles. Instead of asking how to build a better version of an existing product, the innovator asks what the user’s ultimate goal is and what the absolute, unchangeable constraints are. This approach fundamentally reframes the problem, steering the design process away from incremental improvements and toward breakthrough solutions that address the core need. By focusing on the “why” behind the user’s actions, designers can build tools that anticipate needs and remove friction points before they are even noticed. This frees the creator’s mind from the burden of technical problem-solving, allowing them to dedicate all their cognitive energy to what truly matters: storytelling, expression, and bringing their unique vision to life.
Embarking on a path of true innovation is an expensive education, and as Edward suggests, the early struggles are the “tuition” paid for a future advantage that cannot be bought. Pioneering is a slow, arduous process, much like pushing a heavy flywheel. The initial effort is immense, with little visible momentum to show for it. These early phases are filled with setbacks, costly mistakes, and the constant feeling of pushing against inertia. However, this upfront investment in learning, testing, and overcoming unforeseen obstacles builds a deep well of experience-based knowledge. This hard-won wisdom becomes a strategic moat, a defensible asset that late-coming competitors cannot easily replicate. They may be able to copy the final product, but they cannot copy the years of struggle and learning that made it possible.
This pioneering journey is fueled by more than just resilience; it is powered by profound empathy. Edward emphasizes that the most insightful innovators are often their own most demanding users. They relentlessly stress-test their own creations in the messy, unpredictable real world, uncovering failure points and latent needs that would never surface in a controlled lab or a market research report. This hands-on process builds an intuitive understanding of the user experience. Furthermore, this journey requires a pragmatic acceptance of imperfection. The goal is not to launch a flawless product from day one. Instead, the strategy is to release a solid, valuable minimum viable product and then iterate relentlessly with the market. As Edward advises, “perfection comes later iteration by iteration i think it’s less scary that way.” In this model, the community of users becomes a collaborative partner in the design process, their feedback shaping the product’s evolution.
In today’s hyper-competitive market, a single breakthrough product is no longer enough to guarantee long-term success. A brilliant feature can be copied, a clever design can be replicated. True, durable advantage, as Edward argues, comes from building a comprehensive ecosystem around the product. This system of interconnected value is far more difficult for competitors to duplicate. For a company like Insta360, this means the camera itself is just the beginning. The real strength lies in the surrounding ecosystem: the intuitive editing software that simplifies complex workflows, the active user communities that provide support and inspiration, the extensive library of tutorials that flatten the learning curve, and the wide array of accessories that expand the product’s capabilities. This holistic approach creates a sticky, high-friction-to-exit experience that compounds the product’s value over time, turning customers into loyal advocates.
This powerful principle of ecosystem thinking is not just for large corporations; it is equally critical for individual creators striving to build a sustainable career. A viral video or a popular design is fleeting, easily lost in the endless stream of digital content. A career built on an ecosystem, however, is enduring. Edward advises creators to think beyond the next piece of content and instead focus on building systems around their work. This could manifest as developing mentorship programs to nurture emerging talent, creating collaborative workflows with other artists to cross-pollinate audiences, or productizing their expertise through workshops and digital assets. By building a network of value around their core creative output, they transform their work from a series of replaceable artifacts into a resilient, interconnected enterprise that can withstand the unpredictable shifts of trends and algorithms.

The transition from a follower to an innovator can feel like a terrifying leap into the abyss, especially when a proven formula is already paying the bills. The fear of abandoning what works is a powerful deterrent. However, Edward’s advice demystifies this process, transforming the reckless gamble into a series of calculated, manageable steps. The core principle is to de-risk innovation by starting small. Instead of betting the entire farm on an unproven idea, he advocates for experimenting on the periphery with “low-stakes side projects.” This approach allows a creator or a company to explore new technologies, test radical ideas, and build new skills without jeopardizing their main source of income or alienating their core audience. As he simply states, “start small always start small.” It’s a strategy of quiet evolution, building the future in the background while continuing to deliver consistency in the foreground.
To guide this process, Edward offers a practical three-part test to determine if an innovative idea is worth pursuing. First, can the concept be explained in a single, simple sentence? This is a test of clarity and focus, ensuring the idea isn’t convoluted. Second, does it create a unique experience that nothing else currently offers? This validates its potential for true market differentiation. And third, does it address common user complaints? This is the most crucial test, as it confirms that the innovation is solving a real, pre-existing problem, signaling a clear and unmet demand. By using this framework, innovation shifts from being a blind bet to a strategic, evidence-based pursuit. It encourages prototyping, running small user tests, and co-creating with the community, allowing the audience to help guide the direction of progress and ensuring that when you do finally push the boundaries, you bring them along with you.

The 700-piece recreation of the franchise's iconic logo is the ideal centerpiece for your Star Wars collectible display shelves.
By 
    Steven Petite
   on November 2, 2025 at 10:52PM PST
 Lego Brick-Built Star Wars Logo (700 Pieces) 
 $48 (was $60) 
 
Lego's Brick-Built Star Wars Logo is on sale for its lowest price yet at Amazon ahead of the holiday shopping season. The 700-piece display model for adults launched with a budget-friendly $60 MSRP on Star Wars Day, but fans can get it for only $48 for a limited time. It's one of numerous notable Star Wars Lego deals at Amazon and other major retailers in the lead-up to early Black Friday 2025 sales.
 
 
 
The Brick-Built Star Wars Logo accurately depicts the legendary design that dates back to Star Wars: A New Hope's 1977 theatrical release. Exposed studs between the letters add depth and make it clear that this is a Lego set. The rounded edges of the logo are cleverly recreated with a variety of yellow pieces. There's an Easter Egg hidden inside the letter T that pays homage to Episode IV.
The completed 700-piece model measures 5 x 11.5 x 1 inches. If you're looking for a Star Wars model to serve as a centerpiece for your display shelf, it probably doesn't get any more ideal than the series logo constructed from Lego.
The Brick-Built Star Wars Logo launched a few months after the 913-piece Lego Marvel Logo set. The logo series will continue next March with a 678-piece Lego DC Batman Logo. The Marvel Logo comes with five Marvel minifigures that pop out by pressing buttons on the model, and the Batman Logo will include two minifigures. It would've been cool to get minifigures with the Star Wars Logo, but it's the most affordable of the three.

Warren Buffett is finding out just how much he's worth to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders.
The investing icon sent shockwaves through the business world in May when he revealed he would step down as Berkshire's CEO at the end of this year, after nearly six decades in charge.
Berkshire's Class B shares had closed at a record $540 going into the company's annual shareholder meeting. They've plunged 12% to below $480 since Buffett broke the bad news, while the benchmark S&P 500 stock index has risen 20% to record levels of above 6,800 points over the same period.
David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland and longtime Buffett blogger, told Business Insider that the underperformance reflected not just the ""evaporation"" of what's often called the ""Buffett premium"" — the extra value placed on the stock to reflect Buffett's unique contributions — but also the stock getting ahead of itself before the meeting, and the boom in AI stocks such as Nvidia and Microsoft driving the S&P to fresh highs.
Buffett's departure shouldn't be that surprising, given he's now 95 and has been planning a smooth transition for years. However, he has become synonymous with Berkshire to the point where it's hard to imagine the company without him at the helm.
Berkshire was a failing New England textile mill when Buffett acquired it in 1965. Over the next 60 years, he transformed it into one of the world's biggest companies with roughly $400 billion in annual revenue, 400,000 employees, and a $1 trillion market value. Today, Berkshire is the largest shareholder of massive companies such as Coca-Cola and American Express, and fully owns scores of businesses, including Geico, Fruit of the Loom, and the BNSF Railway.
Buffett's chosen successor, who will take the reins as CEO in the new year, is Greg Abel, Berkshire's head of non-insurance operations. Buffett will stay on as chairman, but Abel will take over many of his signature duties, such as writing an annual letter and hosting Berkshire's yearly shareholder gathering.
Berkshire's legendary CEO is leaving at a tricky time for the company. Its third-quarter earnings on Saturday showed a 34% year-on-year surge in operating income to $13.5 billion, fueled by insurance underwriting income nearly tripling to $2.4 billion as well as foreign-currency gains.
But Buffett and his team sold more stocks than they bought, making Berkshire a net seller for a 12th consecutive quarter, and refrained from repurchasing any shares, marking a fifth straight quarter without buybacks. The upshot was Berkshire's cash pile hit yet another record, $358 billion, after subtracting Treasury payables.
The simple reason for Berkshire's cash buildup is that Buffett is a bargain hunter, and bargains are few and far between when stocks are at record highs, private equity firms are driving up the cost of acquisitions, and Berkshire stock is still trading near all-time highs despite its recent slump.
Buffett may be struggling to find compelling purchases, but he's found lots of things to sell. He's now pared two-thirds of Berkshire's biggest stock position, Apple, since 2023.
Berkshire roughly quadrupled its money on paper between 2018 and 2023, as it paid around $36 billion for a roughly 5% stake that was worth over $170 billion by early 2023 as Apple stock boomed.
But if Buffett and his colleagues hadn't sold, their Apple holding would be worth over $240 billion today, or more than six times what they paid. Apple shares have spiked by a third in just the past three months, reaching fresh highs thanks to renewed iPhone and AI optimism.
Berkshire clearly ""left a lot of money on the table,"" Kass said. But it pocketed a large return, and the disposals could still ""prove to be prescient"" if there's an AI bubble and tech stocks crash, he added.
Berkshire has managed to strike a deal during Buffett's final months in charge. In early October, it agreed to acquire OxyChem, Occidental Petroleum's chemicals business, for $9.7 billion in cash. Berkshire is Occidental's largest shareholder with a more than 25% stake.
Darren Pollock, a portfolio manager at Cheviot Value Management, told Business Insider that shareholders love to see Berkshire putting its cash to work. But he said a $10 billion deal is a ""drop in the bucket"" that will barely put a dent in Berkshire's war chest, as the company generates that much cash in a quarter or two.
It's worth noting that cash has been less of a headache for Berkshire since the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates following the pandemic. The company earned over $17 billion of interest, dividend, and other investment income during the first nine months of this year — a big jump from the $7.5 billion it earned over the whole of 2021 when rates were close to zero.
Berkshire's lagging stock price, ballooning cash pile, questionable Apple sales, and a prolonged bargain drought make it a challenging time for Buffett to leave the stage.
But leaving Abel with almost $400 billion in dry powder could be the ultimate gift. Kass told Business Insider that eventually a recession will strike, stocks will tumble, and the trio of Abel and Berkshire's two investment managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, will be ""well positioned to invest Berkshire's ever-growing cash pile at very attractive prices.""
He added that Berkshire's outlook appears ""extremely bright,"" its operating businesses are ""very close to firing on all cylinders,"" and its balance sheet is ""second to none.""
""Greg is the right person at the right time to lead Berkshire forward,"" Kass said.
