The market’s confidence in artificial intelligence may be wavering, and companies with big investments in it seem to be shedding supporters. The Financial Times notes that, over the course of the past week, approximately $1 trillion in stock value has been wiped from several of Silicon Valley’s heaviest hitters, all of which are heavily enmeshed in generative AI. Those companies include Oracle, Meta, Palantir, and Nvidia, the outlet notes. The outlet calls it the worst week for Wall Street since Trumpâs âliberation day.”
The downturn in tech stocks isn’t contained to the industry’s biggest winners. There are also companies like Sweetgreen, the salad company that has tried to position itself as an automation company that serves salads on the side. Indeed, Sweetgreen has tried to dabble in a variety of tech, including AI and robots. However, that dream seems to have died, as the company recently sold off its robotics division to Wonder and its stock has been completely wiped out over the last year.
And then there’s Microsoft, whichâdespite being one of the most powerful and prominent companies in Silicon Valleyâseems to be having one of its biggest losing streaks ever. Bloomberg reported Friday that its stock had slumped 8.6 percent over eight days, a decline that evaporated some $350 billion in market valuation. That’s the company’s worst downturn since 2011, when the company’s stock saw losses for nine days straight, the outlet reports.
At the heart of the stock stumbles, there appears to be a growing anxiety about the AI business, which is massively expensive to operate and doesn’t appear to be paying off in any concrete way. Bloomberg notes that Wall Street may be growing wary of the vast sums of money being poured into AI (Microsoft spent nearly $35 billion in expenditures during its last quarter) while profits remain elusive. Reporting on Microsoft’s stock slump, the outlet notes:
The stock hasnât had a positive session since it reported its quarterly results in late October. While the report featured a number of positives, including better-than-expected growth in its Azure cloudâcomputing business, Wall Street is growing increasingly skeptical toward the huge sums that companies are spending to build out AI infrastructure.
At the same time, the tech slumps may be part of an overall shit-sandwich of an economy, with many available indicators (official economic data isn’t currently available due to the government shutdown) seeming to paint an increasingly dire picture. Indeed, a recent report from career transition services firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed that job losses last month were the worst for October since 2003. Tech led those losses, with Amazon alone shedding some 14,000 jobs, the report showed.
Want more evidence that our economy is currently a dumpster fire? A monthly survey from the University of Michigan has shown that consumer sentiment is currently hitting some of its lowest numbers in the history of the survey. âWith the federal government shutdown dragging on for over a month, consumers are now expressing worries about potential negative consequences for the economy,â Joanne Hsu, the surveyâs director, has said. “This monthâs decline in sentiment was widespread throughout the population, seen across age, income, and political affiliation,” she added.
In other words, we’re in the middle of the “greatest economy” ever. Yes, welcome to the new “Golden Age”, where the jobs are few and far between, everything is expensive, and there’s fear in the air! What a great place to be.

Market musings
Earnings season has been good. Perhaps… too good.
The run-ups in the stock market's favorite tech darlings after earnings last week apparently pushed valuations to a point where investors decided they'd had enough. It's led to a chaotic current week, with two separate valuation-driven sell-offs in a matter of three days.
The institutional class is as split as ever over what the future holds. JPMorgan is recommending investors buy any dips. Billionaire Ray Dalio sees a short-term rally, and then a Fed-driven sell-off. And then there's the overhang of what will happen with President Trump's tariffs, which are facing a prolonged legal battle.
But that only tells part of the story. As retail investing has exploded in popularity, so has the influence of the day-traders populating Reddit and Discord forums. Their behavior can often be a harbinger of what's to come, and the strategy team JPMorgan has conveniently been keeping tabs.
Here are the four main themes that have dominated retail trading over the past week as volatility has raged.
They went on their biggest buying spree in four months, almost entirely in mega-cap tech
But they're not blindly buying market dips
They're getting tired of gold and bitcoin after torrid rallies
They're most excited about these meme stocks
Judging by a ""social interest score"" tracked by JPMorgan, the ""most hyped"" stocks this past week were: Beyond Meat, Nokia, POET Technologies, UiPath, Palantir, Nvidia, Chipotle, and Reddit.
Are you a retail investor that's leaning into these trends, or doing something completely different? Let us know what portfolio moves you've been making at firsttrade@businessinsider.com.
On the heels of another difficult day in the market, console yourself with another example of the value-creating impact of AI deals.
Snap stock surged as much as 18% after announcing a $400 million partnership with Perplexity AI, to incorporate its AI search engine into Snapchat.
It's a good reminder that — even on the toughest of days — AI deals trump all, and can carry a stock to market-beating performance.
Is the gig up for gold? At least as an S&P 500-crushing speculative asset? It appears so.
Following a 20% run up through September and into October, the price of the precious metal has come back down to earth.
The chart above, from JPMorgan, reflects a corresponding shift in sentiment, specifically among retail investors. Note the blue line, which shows that retail buying has plateaued.
Each Friday, I'll discuss and review a piece of markets- or finance-related media: movies, books, TV shows, podcasts, etc.
Today's entry is the movie ""Boiler Room"" (2000).
There are some quotes at the beginning of ""Boiler Room"" — namely ""I just want to get in"" and ""nobody wants to work for it anymore"" — that echo the frivolous, fundamental-lite stock market activity that characterized the meme stock era. Right away, you know this is a movie that's going to deal with a popular evergreen theme: how to get rich quick.
This film is best approached by suspending belief around the illegalities occurring. The schemes are sub-Wolf-of-Wall-Street penny-stock pump and dumps, where the companies don't even exist. It would never happen, at least this flagrantly, but that's not the point. It's all merely a vessel for the movie's top-notch cast of wisecracking early-2000s actors masquerading as stock-brokers.
Vin Diesel executes a pitch-perfect sales call in front of 100 associates, closing the deal to rapt applause. Ben Affleck — the firm's head recruiter — delivers two scintillating motivational monologues to a room full of new hires. Key quote: ""Anybody who tells you that money is the root of all evil, doesn't f**king have any.""
Leading man Giovanni Ribisi excels as a whip-smart, money-hungry youngster who's looking to make the leap from backroom poker games to stock-broking millionaire. And it feels like Jamie Kennedy is acting in a different movie — perhaps channeling his ""Malibu's Most Wanted"" character at some points — but it doesn't matter, he steals every scene he's in.
At one point, the core group of brokers sit around trading extended recitations of the original ""Wall Street."" There's an analogy in there somewhere.
Of course, the movie doesn't take place exclusively within the walls of the Long Island-based JT Marlin (yes, it's that obvious of a play on JPMorgan). The crew ventures into NYC a handful of times to beat up rival brokers from the ""real"" Wall Street, and party at a hotel in celebration of a new (fraudulent) IPO launch.
These are electric and hilarious scenes, and they show that the movie is at its strongest when the core cast is ripping it up, even if a lot of the dialogue is offensive enough to be left in the year 2000.
It's not the best finance movie of all time. But, for my money, it's the most fun. And for that reason it gets a 10/10 rating.
Do you have any ideas about what I should review next? Tell me at firsttrade@businessinsider.com.

2,2025-11-07,"Gemini's intelligence brings hefty research capabilities to users monitoring the ever-changing market.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Enjoy our content? Make sure to set Android Central as a preferred source in Google Search, and find out why you should so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.
This morning (Nov 6), Google Finance announced a major new addition to its platform that those involved with stocks may find fruitful.
It was announced in a Keyword post that Google Finance is receiving Gemini AI assistance via Deep Search. The market is always changing, and Google is trying to give those involved better insight into the changes and how they can be better prepared through AI. It announced that, with Deep Search AI, Google Finance users can ask even more complex questions packed with every minute detail they can think of.
Get specific, and tap the ""Deep Search"" button when you're finished writing your query.
While the AI is attempting to fulfill your query, Google says users will be given a ""research plan,"" so you can understand how things were put together for you. Gemini is said to reach into its reasoning capabilities ""across disparate pieces of information,"" as well as ""issuing up to hundreds of simultaneous searches"" for the user. When dealing with the market, citations are essential, which is why Deep Search will cite its sources once its detailed report is produced.
Deep Search is rolling out to U.S. users ""in the coming weeks,"" and those subscribed to Google AI Pro and Ultra will receive a ""higher limit.""
 



Having the AI help with financial research is one thing, but Google Finance is applying Gemini to market predictions, too.
Google says users can ask the AI about ""future market events"" through supported data from Kalshi and Polymarket. This can be done through Finance's search box for convenience. If you're looking to see how something might grow during the year, Google adds the AI will produce probabilities, using the current available data, alongside how those trends have changed.
Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android
These market predictions are also headed to U.S. users, but Google says it is planning to expand this and Deep Search in Finance to more places. Lastly, the post highlights that the newly revamped Google Finance is arriving in India, the first region to get it outside of the U.S.
Deep Search has been making its rounds across Google's ecosystem, especially since it's so tightly integrated in AI Mode. It originally debuted earlier this year, marking a significant shift for Google's AI and AI Mode. It's become quite prevalent in AI Overviews as a way for users to get more in-depth about certain topics. Deep Search pushes Google's AI to scour even more sources and conduct all that heavy research for you, before spitting out an (ideally) ""comprehensive"" report.

After 31 years at Microsoft, Mike Kostersitz never saw it coming.
In May, his team met with a senior leader about a new product.
""Everybody was happy with the progress,"" said Kostersitz, then a principal product manager lead working on Microsoft's cloud computing platform Azure. ""Everything was peachy.""
The following morning, he noticed a high-priority virtual meeting had been added to his calendar — and it wasn't good news.
""Me and 120 other anonymous faces got told our jobs had been eliminated,"" said the Washington-based 60-year-old. His manager and two of his direct reports were also among the 6,000 employees affected. In July, roughly 9,000 more were laid off. Previously, in January and February, Microsoft had made nearly 2,000 performance-based cuts.
I spoke with seven of the Microsoft workers who lost their jobs over the past 12 months. Microsoft was once known for its ""country club"" culture, but as Ashley Stewart reported for Business Insider earlier this year, leaders worried the company had gone soft, and it ramped up scrutiny on performance.
Inside Business is today's must-read story on what the forces shaping business, tech, and innovation mean for you. Each piece delivers insights to help you make smarter career, money, and life decisions.
A Microsoft spokesperson has said that most of this year's cuts were not performance-based but were intended to reduce management layers and streamline operations. Along with Amazon, Meta, and Google, Microsoft is one of many companies — from Silicon Valley to corporate America — that are fueling the Great Flattening.
The tenure of the ex-Microsofters I spoke to ranged from a few years to more than three decades. Some said any sense of job security they once had was shattered. Several said they were caught off guard by their layoffs, citing factors like long tenure, no documented performance issues, and Microsoft's position as the world's third-most valuable company. They wondered: If job security is dead at Microsoft, will they find it anywhere else?
Kostersitz is one of them. To help with his job search, he said a Microsoft-funded career advisor recommended he ""de-age"" his résumé by erasing work done in the 1980s and '90s. His LinkedIn profile now only shows professional experience since 2003. The advisor also emphasized that today's job market is an endurance test.
""They said it's a game of chicken right now,"" he said. ""The person who has the longer breath and can stick it out longer will get the job.""
Business Insider has heard from dozens of workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers. If you have a story to share, contact this reporter via email at jzinkula@businessinsider.com, via Signal at jzinkula.29, or fill out this quick form.

The experiences of laid-off Microsoft employees are part of a broader shift in corporate America. As Business Insider's Aki Ito has reported, job security was a defining feature of white-collar work during the postwar boom, a period when layoffs and firings were rare. However, globalization — and the overseas competition that accompanied it — gave rise to a new management philosophy focused on cost-cutting, downsizing, and viewing employees as interchangeable.
It's not just about flattening. In cuts this year, companies have cited AI — if not directly for taking jobs, then for creating an environment in which companies can operate with leaner staff. It's what workers have been fearing will happen on a large scale as AI continues to improve and become increasingly omnipresent.
While Microsoft's culture has evolved over the years, some laid-off employees said they believe the recent cuts show the company has entered a new era — one where avoiding layoffs appears to be a lower priority.
The former Microsoft employees, in addition to dozens of other laid-off workers I've spoken with over the past year, told me they are grappling with how to protect their careers and financial well-being after an unexpected chop.
Before Eduardo Noriega was laid off by Microsoft in May, he'd been nervous about his job security since 2009, when the company cut about 5,000 workers.
""When I saw the layoff, I realized that job security isn't real,"" said Noriega, who's in his 50s and lives in Seattle.
After weighing his options, Noriega concluded that his best chance at financial stability was to build a side business he could rely on if he ever lost his job.
By the time he was cut in May, he'd spent nearly a decade building a staffing firm outside work hours — and was earning more from it than from his software engineering job. He said he had been hesitant to quit Microsoft and give up the steady paycheck, but the layoff gave him the push he needed to go all in.
""I never dared to quit,"" he said. ""And then Microsoft presented the layoff, and for me, that was like an exit.""
For other workers across corporate America, the challenge of landing a new role in today's economy has upped the stakes of sudden unemployment.
While layoffs across the broader economy remain low by historical standards, white-collar roles have been particularly vulnerable. At the same time, US businesses are hiring at one of the slowest rates since 2013.
""If you become unemployed, it's become much harder to find a job,"" said Laura Ulrich, director of economic research at the Indeed Hiring Lab. And because hiring was so much stronger in many industries just a few years ago, she said, the shift may feel especially stark.
Ian Carter began working at Microsoft in 2021, and he said the company's layoffs in 2023 and 2024 sent a clear message: His job wasn't safe.
""It felt like it didn't matter if you were a great worker or not,"" said the 33-year-old. ""Everybody was at risk.""
Since being laid off in May from his position as a technical program manager, he has struggled to find a job. He drew on savings for several months to cover expenses and switched to a month-to-month lease on his Redmond, Washington, apartment — crossing his fingers that he'd land something soon. But he never did. In late October, he stored his belongings and moved to Florida to live with his family and save money while continuing his search.
""Rent is expensive,"" he said, ""but rent without income coming in is doubly expensive.""
In May, Joe Friend learned that he and 14 other members of his working group had been laid off.
Friend's tenure at Microsoft spanned more than two decades across three stints, but this was the first time he hadn't left by choice. Friend said he believes there's been a culture shift within Microsoft — one that's left employees with less job security than they once had. Some of his concerns extend beyond Microsoft to Big Tech more broadly — which is why he plans to be highly selective about his next role.
""I think I'd rather earn $50,000 a year doing something I'm excited about,"" said the 62-year-old. ""It doesn't mean I won't jump back into a job, but it certainly won't be Big Tech.""
Deborah Hendersen took a different approach. After 14 years at Microsoft, Hendersen, a user researcher in the company's Xbox division, was one of about 9,000 employees laid off in July.
""It wasn't so much like watching a car wreck,"" said the 45-year-old, who lives in Seattle. ""It was more like you were in the car, knowing it was going to wreck.""
The moment she received a mysterious meeting invite that she suspected would bring bad news, she began laying the groundwork for her future. She shared a message internally and on LinkedIn to tell her network that she'd been laid off and to learn who else had been affected. This led to the creation of a Discord chat of more than a dozen affected colleagues, where people shared job opportunities, helped each other prepare for interviews, vented their frustrations, and celebrated their successes.
Hendersen also turned to her network to find openings and secure referrals. One of the roles recommended to her was a user experience researcher position at Meta. She received a referral and, in late August, a job offer.
Hendersen credited her network — and in particular her laid-off colleagues — for supporting her during this challenging period.
""It's so helpful to have the support of other people who are going through it — both the highs and the lows,"" she said. ""Because everybody gets turned down, gets their hopes up, and is just figuring out how to remain sane in a really challenging time.""

Economists, journalists, and investors won't be waiting by their laptops this morning for a new jobs report.
It's the second month without this data release. The agency isn't releasing most reports or collecting data during the government shutdown, which is the longest one in US history. However, job seekers, economists, and anyone else missing the BLS reports can turn to recent publications from ADP, Indeed, Bank of America, and others to get a sense of how the job market and broader economy are doing.
The analyses showed that October was still a tough month for job seekers. Announced job cuts climbed based on a report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas; demand cooled to a level not seen in years based on job postings on Indeed; and various reports together show a soft job market.
Allison Shrivastava, an economist with the Indeed Hiring Lab, told Business Insider it's lucky that there are a lot of private sector data releases to ""piece together a picture of what's going on in the economy."" However, she added that even those alternative sources often rely on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to calibrate their work, so without it, job-market clarity is muddied.
Here's what recent releases said about October's job market.
Based on ADP payroll data, the US added 42,000 private sector jobs in October after falling in the previous two months. Despite beating the 32,000 consensus, Nela Richardson, the chief economist at ADP, said in the news release that hiring was modest. Most of the net growth came from large companies that have at least 500 employees.
Job growth was mixed by industry. Trade, transportation, and utilities together added 47,000 jobs. Employment dipped in information, manufacturing, professional and business services, and leisure and hospitality.
Bill Adams, the chief economist for Comerica Bank, said in commentary that the federal layoffs — which aren't included in the ADP national employment report — would pretty much cancel out the private employment growth in October. Many government workers aren't working during the government shutdown and are missing pay.
Challenger, Gray & Christmas found that announced job cuts from US-based employers skyrocketed over the month to the highest October total since 2003 — increasing from 54,064 to 153,074 this past October. Last month's gain means over 1 million announced cuts so far this year, more than the roughly 761,000 cuts for the entire previous year.
""Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes,"" Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer, said in the report.
Ernie Tedeschi, a nonresident senior fellow at The Budget Lab at Yale, recently told Business Insider that companies like Amazon, which announced a reduction of 14,000 corporate workers, are likely correcting for overhiring during the pandemic-era and Great Resignation.
Shrivastava told Business Insider the US is in a precarious, not dangerous situation based on the platform's data. Job postings trended downward last month, hitting the lowest point since 2021.
""Things have been kind of eroding slowly,"" Shrivastava said. ""Not a lot of job growth added, still really difficult to break into the labor market, people still really holding onto their jobs.""
It's not just employees sitting still; Shrivastava said employers have mainly been holding onto workers. Despite new cuts making news, BLS data up to August showed US layoff rates have been low for years — the 2021 to 2025 average of 1.0% is a hair below the 2015 to 2019 average of 1.2%.
Shrivastava said a surge in layoffs would ""be kind of the thing that tips the tower over.""
Kory Kantenga, the head of economics for the Americas at LinkedIn, said in a post that October hiring wasn't too far off from September, although it did fall 0.8% and down from the start of the year. The number of job openings per applicant has also been cooling, and dropped 1% over the month. Kantenga said in the post that both supply and demand have dropped.
""The job market has been running slow, it's continuing to run slow,"" Kantenga told Business Insider. ""There just isn't a lot of momentum across the board.""
Kantenga told Business Insider that job seekers need to be open to industries that are still hiring, such as healthcare and construction.
""There are areas where things have actually started to turn around, but they're not yet where they need to be for there to be a lot of opportunities,"" Kantenga said. ""Technology, information, and media is one.""
The Bank of America Institute said there was ""​​no significant further slowdown in the labor market"" last month based on internal data on how many of the bank's customers are getting paychecks.
""While this data does suggest a slowdown in jobs growth has taken place since the summer, it tends to suggest that for now at least, there is no further deceleration,"" the new report said.
Unemployment payments were up from a year ago, but the report said the growth rate cooled slightly from September. Across the board, households had higher pay than a year ago, but higher-income households had the highest rise.
Gusto, a payroll and benefits platform for small businesses, found that the hiring rate and quits rate at those businesses cooled in October. Net hires at small businesses also fell by 5,900, the first drop since January. Average hourly earnings are also up a little bit from a year ago.
""We're witnessing a significant shift in small business hiring patterns,"" Andrew Chamberlain, the principal economist at Gusto, said, adding there's essentially no job growth happening compared to the growth during the post-pandemic recovery.
""The culprits are clear: persistently high borrowing costs that keep business loans at 7-15%, ongoing tariff uncertainty that makes planning nearly impossible, and elevated operating expenses across the board,"" he said.
More rate cuts could help business owners. The Fed cut rates in September and October after holding rates steady throughout 2025. Chamberlain said Gusto expects a rebound ""as the Fed starts to relax interest rates in the coming year.""

Advent calendars turn the December countdown into a daily ritual of surprise and anticipation, and LEGO’s Star Wars version delivers on exactly that with a galaxy far, far away twist. This year’s LEGO Star Wars Advent calendar has dropped to an all-time low of $26 on Amazon, slashed from its original $44 price tag.
The calendar is packed with 24 surprises behind its doors, and turns each day in December into a mini building adventure that brings iconic droids and characters into your home. LEGO clearly wants to move inventory before Advent begins and that urgency creates an opportunity for anyone planning their holiday celebrations.
See at Amazon
Behind each numbered door waits a Star Wars surprise that builds anticipation throughout the month. You get C-3PO and a Holiday Jawa as minifigures and gives kids immediately recognizable characters to play with right out of the gate. Babu Frik makes an appearance as a LEGO figure, bringing the tiny droidsmith from The Rise of Skywalker into your collection. Five droid figures round out the character lineup including R7-A7, BD-72, a Scrap Battle Droid, BB-8 dressed as a snowman for the holidays, and a Super Battle Droid ready for action.
Eight buildable droids across several days keep hands busy with construction challenges. Kids will assemble a Pit Droid, Gonk Droid, and Buzz Droid, each with different building techniques that develop spatial reasoning skills. Holiday versions of a Medical Droid and Mouse Droid add festive touches to familiar Star Wars machinery. B2EMO from the Andor series joins the roster alongside a Treadwell Droid and Probe Droid, giving fans droids across different eras of Star Wars storytelling.
Of course, the calendar is not limited to characters and droids. Mini builds create Babu Frik’s workshop piece by piece, with a workbench, chair, tool rack, and shelves making an appearance as the days progress. It also includes a box of extra parts, crane, and bucket to enhance the workshop setup for kids to play out the busy work of the droidsmith fixing and upgrading mechanical companions. A Jawa buildable vehicle expands play possibilities, and a Christmas tree brings holiday cheer to the Star Wars universe.
With 263 pieces in total, this calendar allows the building experience to be spread out throughout the month rather than overwhelming kids with one huge construction project. Every day, a manageable build is accomplished, which feels rewarding without hours of focus, perfect for children aged 6 and up who are still developing their LEGO skills.

stagnant wages.
A ""boom"" is where regular people, workers, corporations, and the larger society have improving income, a rising standard of living for people, more opportunities and overall better less dangerous working conditions.
Corporate profits going up with declining stagnant wages after inflation, less jobs, and less quality jobs is not a boom. /.. needs to look at the source and see that this is a company talking its own book and using a press release to sell the company's services.

It's the Welch-era GE all over again, but across all companies.
Just like COVID introduced an accelerated market change, so has the introduction of AI. Not because of any real changes in productivity patterns, rather, it just gives an excuse for the snap-back of the market realities. Underperformers are being cut after years of hanging on, not because of AI productivity improvements, just because there's been a hiring boom and years of not much turnover.
AI is bullshit and vastly overrated.
Same for crony capitalism.
AI is bullshit and vastly overrated.Well, it's not really AI in any sense of the honest term; it's not a self aware machine. AI has become a marketing term for servers running a bunch of fancy scripts that produce dialogue that can pass for human speech fairly well. BUT...

AI has problems for sure. Not a month goes by without news of yet another idiot lawyer getting sanctioned because of the hallucinations were presented as fact. However......have you tried coding with AI? I have. I'm 5x more productive than before, and I can solve problems now that I wouldn't have touched before. I still test my code. I still review it. But man, this thing is a game changer. I can see why people are paying big money for it. It absolutely is delivering.

Funny thing, ""underperformers"" have to eat too.
Does Musk need people to buy his cybertruck or was just advertising it enough to boost Tesla stock so that he gets his market cap bonuses?
If trillionaires make all their money from stocks going up and the stock market is independent of the real economy, why not encourage bubbles while printing a strong basic income?
If people don't buy stuff eventually the corporation collapses. The principals can make a profit before then, but repeat this enough times and the whole boat sinks as it happens to too many major employers at once. Hence too big to fail, which is of course the result of failure to enforce antitrust law.
The market, for all its (profoundly inelegant) complexities, remains a crude and essentially blind system, and is – without the sort of drastic amendments liable to cripple the economic efficacy which 
The idea that workers should be paid enough to buy their own companyâ(TM)s products never made sense. Why did you idiot communists keep pushing it? Does Ferrari need all its employees to be able to buy a Ferrari? I pay you $10 to buy my $8 product? What kind of stupidity is that? Where is the logic in that. I lose $2. If profits could be made like that, I could have a bot clicking âoebuyâ on my website.
The billionaire class. Yeah right. That's nothing but mumbo jumbo, as if the billionaires all wanted the same thing. Do you think Elon Musk and George Soros want the same thing?
You seem to lack an understanding of what slavery actually is, and how much better off someone who ""gets paid barely enough to live"" is compared to a slave.
Neither. In arguing that there is a universe of difference between poverty and slavery.
Nobody's forcing anybody. If you're not satisfied with your pay, hold out for more! If the company won't give you more, go find your desired rate of pay somewhere else! If you can't get more money for the job you're willing or able to do because somebody else will do it for cheaper, that's not the company's fault, that's the other guy's fault. Maybe the other guy doesn't need as much to live as you do. Does that make him a slave?

""jobless boom.""
What a mix of negative (jobless) and positive (boom).
Next thing you know they'll say that all those eliminated SNAP benefits (and resulting purchases) are saving money on storage space, refrigeration, gasoline (for transport), labor. All that money saved!
The difference between poetry and rhetoric is being ready to kill yourself instead of your children.  When condemning anyone to death, it is best started with yourself.
I haven't had children and have no plans to do so. You and your children are welcome. I've already done infinitely more to help the world's climate change issue then anyone that had a child.
Infinitely more would be removing yourself from the equation in a carbon negative way. I suggest swallowing seeds and falling into an early grave.

Call me old-fashioned, but if you are not actively looking for a job, you shouldn't get any benefits from the government (including SNAP). People permanently reliant on SNAP are a burden on taxpayers and a contributing factor to inflation (since they consume without producing). To reply to your assertion dir 
--but if you are not actively looking for a job, you shouldn't get any benefits from the government (including SNAP). --
I think we should have temporary benefits for those who hit a rough patch. But I agree that it shouldn't be a continuing, open-ended thing.
Sadly, it then costs additional money to maintain a system to prod recipients to continue their job search.
If you can do your job from home, then an Indian can do your job from India for a fraction of the price. Why even bother hiring America?
Did you see who our President is?
The third solution is a revolution. It’s going to get really crazy when people in the USA realize that there’s not enough food, a couple big Wall Street companies own all the housing, and there are 400 millions guns in private hands.
The most violent (against their own citizens) political leaders in modern history are: Mao Zedong: Communism, Joseph Stalin: Socialism and Pol Pot: Communism. .  Which of these yielded the most peaceful and abundant results without the need to opening themselves to capitalism??
For the typical person, both Russia and China were better places to live after their revolutions than before them.  I am not sure that even the Cambodian revolution wasn't an improvement for the rural peasants who supported it. The Indian revolution likewise, despite the orgy of violence that the partition created. The reality is that real revolutions are usually acts of desperation by people who have nothing to lose and history is usually written by people with a lot to lose. So the damage a revolution's excesses do to those that had something to lose is always emphasized whether its the French Revolution, the Indian partition or Pol Pot. We are a long way from having enough desperate people in the United States to have a violent revolution. I would watch the homeless crisis, the crackdown on immigrants, the defunding of food stamps and medicaid, the growing personal debt and the failing retirement system, rather than AI or global warming, if you are looking for the seeds of revolution. When looking to the future is staring down into a bleak deep cavern, people will be willing to risk violence to change things.

Even with 400 million guns, the citizenry would be no match for the military All the current regime needs to do is make sure that the military doesn't splinter when the revolution starts. This could be done by bifurcating the current military into something like Iran's revolutionary guard, and the rest of the military (The latter would have inferior weaponry, and basically be cannon fodder)
So what if there's a revolution in the future where the regime is going to lose? Well, the  ""evil team"" can handle this 
All the current regime needs to do is make sure that the military doesn't splinter when the revolution starts. Not easy to do if the revolution has popular support and you have a citizen army. One question is to what extent the US military is a volunteer army as opposed to a professional army. But, unlike wars, revolutions aren't won by ""blood and iron"" alone.The country is divided and people are forced to choose sides. Those choices get made for all sorts of different reasons and will be fluid.

The winner will be the side that holds together a core of people that is determined to win and/or has no alternative. Its

Most of those guns are irrelevant, as guns don't kill people by themselves, and a person can only realistically use two at a time, and can only use one at a time well.

Plus, you know, the government has thermal vision, guided munitions, satellite overwatch.And training.  The majority are hunters and sport shooters. About 2/3rds have had basic safety training, and the numbers drop precipitously from there for anything more advanced. Best number I can find is 10-20% have some form of defensive/tactical tactical training.  Less than 5% have had ongoing/professional training. Someone's ability to successfully wield a deer rifle diminishes rapidly when the ""prey"" starts shooting back.

And ammo. Yeah some people have thousands of rounds of ammo. The military has millions of rounds, and enough men to go with them to effectively utilize suppressive fire. If you do get in an old-fashioned firefight with soldiers they can simply outbullet you if for some reason they don't have an armed backpack drone. Which by the way they totally do.
What if we at least try basic income with indexation to fight inflation? What have we got to lose, but outdated economic models?
Your idea has failed miserably on every significant attempt in history - the result is sometimes an initial chimeric short-term fluff-up but always a long term disastrous decline. Far better:
- Tie reward to productivity, not identity. A reasonable minimum wage can help here, although Sweden has none.- Tie welfare to individual need, not identity.  This is the Swedish and U.S. model.

In fact, people making $500,000 got a tax cut over $7,000 and people making the then median income of $50,000 got a $600 tax cut. Like the rest of us, the rich got a tax cut on their first $250,000.

Is there a third solution I'm not seeing or are we just going to descend into a feudal dystopia?

Realistically? Make people farmland owners again, so they always have a job to fall back on (farming). That way, working for a corporation becomes optional. And stop allowing in illegal immigrants, who, being landless by default, will have to be substituted by the landed citizens one way or another.
We can look forward to a modern form of Feudalism incoming, sprinkled with religious and political extremism to keep the plebs focused. No panem, no circenses, just ora e labora and paying taxes to make up for the megacorps losses.
A couple of decades? That's strange. Some how, I was able to afford a condo in San Diego back in 2010 off a retail grocery job. Let that sink in for a minute. A high school drop out job afforded me a condo only 20 minutes from the beach.
For the moment, housing is clearly in a bubble and is still about double from pre-pandemic pricing. It's not sustainable and eventually it will change. Probably with the next recession.

This really isn't a difficult problem to solve.
You pay fast food wages you get fast food quality work in return.
That's a real problem, but it ignores that the labor statistics are manipulated for political ends, so you can't trust them.
It's not at all clear to me that we currently have low unemployment among those who would be seeking jobs if they thought they had a chance.  (Once you've been unemployed for a while I believe they stop counting you.  Admittedly, it's been over a decade since I looked into that.)
The BLS employment stats may have strict definitions that don't match your political tastes, but they are not manipulated. They are, in fact, one of the gold standards for social science statistical data.
It's not at all clear to me that we currently have low unemployment among those who would be seeking jobs if they thought they had a chance. The labor force includes anyone who is employed plus anyone who is actively looking for work. The unemployment rate most often reported in the news is simply the number actively looking divided by the labor force. Why count people as unemployed if they are not looking for work?

Those two numbers don’t tell the story. They don’t tell you if:
- Wages are keeping up with inflation, including housing and health costs.- Jobs are in the public sector or the more productive private sector.- Part time jobs are replacing full.- Cheap imported labor is replacing native.- Folks have stopped looking for work not just because of retirement - but perhaps out of frustration, forced retirement, or government subsidies replacing the need.
You get that the unemployment rate is literally designed to be a falsehood because it stops counting people when they have been unemployed for a while, right? The methodology used for it has no concept of who is looking for work at all, it's based on a fundamentally bogus assumption that people who haven't found any for long enough aren't looking.

1) Growth.  Here you are growing and hiring.  You have figured out how to make money and are doing it as fast as you can.  Even if someone is bad at their job, they already know how to do it - so you simply let them keep it while everyone else is promoted. They have to really screw up to get fired.  Business wise, every decision has to be profitable - but if you got a good product that can be easy to do because you have no real competition.

A lot of people can feel that the economy isn’t doing so hot right now. Unfortunately, due to the government shutdown, we don’t have much in the way of official economic data to give statistical clarity to that feeling. However, more and more, private firms are releasing their economic analysis, and, much of the time, it doesn’t bode well for the American worker.
Now, a new report shows that this October was a particularly brutal month for the U.S. workforceâand it was especially bad for the tech industry. The analysis, from career transition services firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, shows that this past month was the worst in decades. The report states that U.S. employers announced some “153,074 job cuts in October, up 175% from the 55,597 cuts announced in October 2024. It is up 183% from the 54,064 job cuts announced one month prior.”
Yikes, that’s a lot. And the cuts have been especially deep for Silicon Valley:
Technology continues to lead in private-sector job cuts as companies restructure amid AI integration, slower demand, and efficiency pressures. In October, the sector announced 33,281 job cuts, up sharply from 5,639 in September. For the year, Technology firms have announced 141,159 job cuts, up 17% from the 120,470 announced through the same period in 2024.
Yeah, that’s bad. That is not good at all. There’s no real way to spin that as good. âThis is the highest total for October in over 20 years, and the highest total for a single month in the fourth quarter since 2008,” the report states. “Like in 2003, a disruptive technology is changing the landscape.”
âOctoberâs pace of job cutting was much higher than average for the month. Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes,” said Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer for Challenger, Gray & Christmas. “Those laid off now are finding it harder to quickly secure new roles, which could further loosen the labor market.â
We’ve already written about the huge layoffs that impacted the tech industry last monthâincluding some 14,000 people who used to be (but are no longer) employed with Amazon. The exact reason for why tech companies are shedding jobs right now is still up in the air. One narrative attributes the layoffs to the rise of AI, but other commentators have noted that it could be much more mundane economic/business factors that are squeezing the industry like a lack of growth in non-AI sectors and tariff policy eating away at profits while making it difficult to plan for the future.

12,2025-11-07,"The Playstation 3 had a dizzying number of variants from its first launch in 2006 to when they stopped selling the slim models over a decade later in 2017. Of all those, you’ve probably never heard of the water-cooled Playstation 3 Pro, for the simple reason that it did not exist until [Zac] of Zac Builds created it in a video to push the limits of the now-vintage hardware.
This hack isn’t totally unique; you used to be able to buy watercooling kits for the PS3, but like the console itself, those have long since left the market. Of course [Zac] is hacking this Playstation 3 in 2025, so he’s doing it in a very modern way: with 3D scanning and CNC machining.
After very, very carefully removing the heat spreaders from the CPU and GPU to replace the dried out thermal paste, [Zac] scans the main board to design mounts for the dual waterblocks. Those mounts are, of course, 3D printed in carbon fibre reinforced nylon. Since the mount is going to be under pressure and rather warm, he anneals the nylon for 24 hours at 85 degrees. 3D printing also comes into play mount the pump and radiator into a handsome case that nearly looks like something Sony could have put out back in the day. That whole workflow seems normal today, but would have been borderline science-fiction with the console was new. .
Note that this is not a 2007 unit. [Zac] picked the newest PS3 he could that was still hackable–each revision got more efficient as the chips moved to smaller architectures, but Sony did eventually lock down the firmware to prevent overclocking. Which is of course the point here: since the stock hardware leaves a lot on the table in terms of thermal management, [Zac] figured there would be great performance boosts available.
As it happens, [Zac] was right about performance boosts– on GPU limited titles, he’s getting upto 50% higher frame rates. (Which makes sense, given he’s overclocking the GPU by about 50%.) Loading times are also much improved with the inevitable HDD to SSD swap.
The last time we featured a watercooled playstation hack was back in 2011, for a PS3 laptop of all things. The modern workflow makes it much easier. It’s been a few years since we last posted a Playstation 3 hack. Perhaps now, as they age into becoming “retro” we’ll see a revival in that category.
Thanks to [Stephen Walters] for the tip, via Yanko Design, which seems to provide an LLM-assisted (or generated) summary of [Zac]’s video.


I totally understand playing things on the correct hardware, but in 2025, wouldn’t those PS3 only titles (how many?) play better and have better graphics on an emulator? This isn’t a PS1 where the analog output was designed to work with a CRT to try and fake colours, I’m not sure there’s an actual real use case here. (although it’s still very cool)

A billion-dollar diabetes company that's previously refused to write Ozempic prescriptions is now changing its tune — right as the drugs are about to get a lot cheaper.
Omada Health, the chronic care startup that went public in June, said Thursday it would start prescribing GLP-1 medications for obesity. Until now, Omada has stayed out of the GLP-1 prescribing game, leaving those decisions up to patients' primary care providers.
The company's timing was fortuitous. A few hours earlier, President Donald Trump announced a deal to significantly lower the out-of-pocket cost of GLP-1 drugs, in the range of $50 to $350 a month. Currently, a monthly dose can cost over $1,000.
CEO Sean Duffy said during Omada's third-quarter earnings call on Thursday that the company will start offering GLP-1 prescriptions in the first half of 2026. Duffy previously told Business Insider at the time of Omada's June IPO that he wasn't seeing consistent demand from patients to obtain their GLP-1 prescriptions from Omada and that the company was open to prescribing GLP-1s if it saw more member demand.
""We'll let the members speak, so if all of a sudden 10 out of 10 members next year are like, please, Omada, help me here, we may, but that's not our strategy right now,"" he said at the time.
Omada's ultimate decision to prescribe GLP-1s wasn't made according to member demand, however, Duffy told Business Insider on Friday. Instead, Omada received feedback from primary care providers, as well as from its employer customers, that the rapidly changing GLP-1 landscape was becoming too complex a burden for the providers to bear on their own.
""Different types of meds at different price points were the key reason in deciding it's time to describe,"" Duffy said. He added that many employers expect their overall costs to rise following the potential FDA approval of oral versions of GLP-1 drugs. The pills are expected to be much cheaper, but employers assume many more patients will want to take the drugs in that form, raising their total spend, Duffy said.
The Trump administration's Thursday announcement, Duffy said, ""underscores exactly why we're offering prescribing.""
The Trump administration said Thursday it had notched deals with drugmakers Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to get discounts on their GLP-1 drugs for weight loss.
It's the administration's latest effort to offer discounted drugs to Americans on behalf of the federal government, via its TrumpRx program, unveiled in late September.
Through TrumpRx, Wegovy and Zepbound will start around $350 per month for patients not using insurance, officials said. The administration aims to drop the price to $250 within two years. For the first time, Medicare will cover GLP-1 drugs for weight loss, with some qualifying Medicare patients paying just a $50 monthly co-pay for the medications.
Oral versions of the drugs, which are still under development and haven't been approved by the FDA, will be available via TrumpRx at no more than $149 a month after they hit the market.
Omada Health, founded in 2011, has been supporting members on GLP-1s for years. The company will pair its new GLP-1 prescribing program with human and AI coaching to support members before, during, and after taking GLP-1 medications, including to help patients safely taper off their prescriptions.
The company is aiming to keep employers' drug costs in check while helping patients avoid the rebound weight gain that's common after stopping GLP-1s. Employers can choose to opt out of offering GLP-1 prescriptions, Duffy said.
Duffy said Omada will use a third-party telehealth solution to source clinicians to prescribe the GLP-1s. He declined to name the partner Omada plans to work with.
Omada Health had previously been cautious about its AI strategy, too, holding off on releasing consumer-facing AI tools until a few months ago. But Duffy said during the earnings call that Omada plans to double down on GLP-1s and generative AI next year as it enters ""the year of the Gs.""
Omada's third-quarter earnings and revenue beat investor expectations, but the stock had dropped over 7% by midday Friday. Analysts have previously expressed concerns that Omada isn't yet profitable (though the company narrowed its losses to about $3.2 million in the third quarter) and faces an increasingly competitive digital health market as it looks to compete with dozens of online GLP-1 prescribers.
Duffy emphasized that Omada posted a strong quarter and said he's learning to ignore the stock jumps and tumbles.
""Investors who are long say they're not worried about the volatility. I've stopped trying to guess. It's what we signed up for,"" he said.

If you had the “over” on the bet that over 10% of trades on the predictions market Polymarket are inauthentic, go ahead and cash in that ticket. According to a recent study from researchers at Columbia University, as much as one quarter of all trading volume happening on the platform is âartificial trading.â
The researchers looked at three years’ worth of buying and selling activity on Polymarket, which allows people to trade “contracts” related to real-world events based on the probability of a given outcome. What they found was that about 25% of those contracts were “wash trades,” which happens when a person or entity buys and sells the same contract to create fake levels of trading volume that can manipulate the market.
It’s important to note that the researchers don’t accuse Polymarket of participating in these transactions to artificially create apparent interest in an event, but they do suggest that the fact that the platform is using a cryptocurrency stablecoin as its medium of exchange may make these types of transactions easier for traders to execute.
The researchers developed an algorithm that helped to identify accounts that were only engaging with a small subset of other accounts, regularly buying a contract one of those other accounts was selling or vice versa. That revealed networks of traders who appeared to be performing wash trades that artificially created additional volume and interest where there otherwise was none.
There was no shortage of those types of transactions happening. In fact, the researchers flagged nearly 15% of wallets on the platformâa total of 1.26 million of themâthat they believe are participating in these artificial transactions. While 25% of all Polymarket volume can be attributed to these fake trades, per the researchers, levels spiked much higher than that at times. At its peak in December 2024, they estimate that as much as 60% of trading volume was likely attributable to phony orders.
Polymarket did not respond to a request for comment regarding the study’s findings.
While Polymarket may not be actively involved in manipulating trading volume on its platform, it sure does do a lot of work to generate volume via posting bait on social media. On November 4, the day of the New York mayoral election, the company went all in on trying to gin up buyers and sellers willing to bet on the outcome of the race, posting about how Mamdani was listed twice on the ballot (a thing that is true but not malicious, as right wing accounts across social media tried to to suggest) and saying there was a “surge of whales” betting on Andrew Cuomo to win while asking, “Do they know something we don’t?” That’s probably not technically market manipulation, but it is pretty shameless.

Yvette Berman thought she would spend the rest of her career at the IT consulting firm where she worked, as she was gearing up to retire in the next several years. 
But in late 2023, Berman, who's in her 50s, was laid off. It came at an inopportune time for the household: Her husband had been laid off from his role just a few months prior.
She's not feeling optimistic about her job search, partly because of how tough it has been for people around her. She said one long-time job seeker she knows is giving up their search and looking to shift into entrepreneurship. Meanwhile, Berman's husband got contract work after a long job search. Berman has been networking, but has only had a few interviews.
""I thought a year ago the job market was difficult,"" Berman said. ""I think it's even more so now.""
What’s your job search been like? Reach out to these reporters to share your story at mhoff@businessinsider.com and jkaplan@businessinsider.com.
The US job market has changed a lot since Berman and other job seekers who have been out of work for a year or longer started looking. Workers who have jobs are staying put in their roles, job openings are stagnant, and those on the outside — who may have been thrust there by layoffs or downsizing — are finding it increasingly harder to claw their way back in.
A rise in long-term unemployment has been quietly undergirding the shape of the new labor market. Just over a quarter of unemployed workers in August had been out of work and seeking a new job for at least 27 weeks. That's the highest share since February 2022.
For job seekers who have been on the hunt for a while, it's meant a soul-searching process. People have had to switch up their strategies, figure out how to fill in experience gaps, and pick themselves up after not making it through interviews. Longer term, it might mean a hiring market that has to tolerate and embrace résumés with larger holes, while workers pivot to figure out their next acts.
Job hunters told Business Insider that they were struggling to find work because of their age, ghost job openings, and salary expectations, among other factors.
After becoming unemployed in the summer of 2024, Bryce Celotto thought he would have a full-time job by December. However, he's still looking; he briefly worked a part-time job and has done some contract work.
""Job seekers should not have to jump through countless, seemingly endless hoops just for the bare minimum, and that is what the market today is demanding,"" Celotto said.
Celotto said he was told he was overqualified for a few jobs he interviewed for. He also thinks he's having a hard time landing work because ""a lot of times when I get into the room in front of a hiring committee, they don't know what to do with me because they've never seen anybody like me before"" since he's Black, trans, and autistic.
Not all hope is lost for people who have been unemployed for a while. In the low-hire, low-fire job market, people may need to adjust their job search repeatedly. Even broadening to temporary positions could help long-term unemployed Americans fill the time and break an employment gap.
""I know we all want that dream job, but it's important to consider contract work or hybrid roles or adjacent industries,"" Priya Rathod, the workplace trends editor at Indeed, said. ""It's really not settling when you do that. You're getting your foot in the door, you're gaining momentum, you're gaining experience, all things that are really important when the right full-time job comes along.""
Brad White, who started his job search in late 2023 after a contract ended, has done some other contract work and worked unpaid at a job-search startup for a bit, partially because it would add experience to his résumé.
He was a community manager at the startup, where he engaged with people on Discord about their job search, and members shared tips with one another. He was let go from that job, but has a new small Discord community where people can still talk about job seeking.
White has found this helpful during his job search, so he doesn't feel like he's going through the process alone; he recommends other job seekers get involved with communities.
In August, he had an interview for a gig. He said the job wouldn't pay much, but ""enough to pay for a babysitter so I can spend more time trying.""
In addition, the interview was at 3 a.m. due to a time difference, but he added, ""That is what desperation looks like.""
White said he made it through a few rounds of interviews but ultimately didn't get the job.
""It's pretty tough that November will be two years,"" he said, adding it's also hard because he enjoyed his previous work and just wished he could get a new chance.
Natalie Schreffler, the assistant director of graduate career services at the University of Iowa's Tippie College of Business, said that on the employer side, there's been a shift in how longer gaps are perceived.
""The gap used to be this big red flag. People would be so nervous to have a gap on their résumé,"" Schreffler said. Job hunters used to contort themselves and their résumés to make it appear as though they had no gaps, something she said would hurt more than help job seekers. However, those gaps are no longer as significant an issue. ""On the employer side, we're seeing a lot more understanding of the realities in the job market.""
Rathod, the workplace trends editor at Indeed, said long-term job seekers should be proactive about their job gap and include it on their résumé. However, she said people should also add how they have been filling their time professionally, such as getting a certification and upskilling.
Berman, the job seeker in her 50s, has gained two certifications in the past few months to upskill during her job search for chief of staff roles.
For job seekers like Berman, though, it's still a hard road to travel. Her husband's contract is supposed to end soon.
""It's stressful knowing we don't have permanent, full-time employment,"" Berman said.

AI is upending a business that hasn't changed in generations.
Over the past year, a new wave of consulting tech startups has emerged in Silicon Valley. These companies are helping clients manage their data, make better decisions, and optimize their technology, all through the use of AI.
While some on the list are not shy about their ambitions to eventually take a slice of business from the Big Four or the MBB, others are looking to complement the established players' work.
Business Insider asked a handful of investors to identify a few of the most promising startups to watch in this emerging category of consulting tech. Here are four AI-powered consulting startups to watch, according to five investors who are backing them.
Total funding: $136 million
What it does:
PromptQL is an enterprise platform that aims to automate some of the work of a typical consultant, like surfacing insights and generating reports. It helps clients build custom AI analysts by integrating their internal data with the foundation models they already use.
Once deployed, these AI analysts can perform tasks typically handled by data scientists or engineers — and continuously learn and adapt to their environments over time.
PromptQL also offers access to its team of expert engineers, who help companies operate their AI analysts and shape broader AI transformation strategies — at a rate of $900 an hour.
Tanmai Gopal, PromptQL's CEO and founder, told Business Insider that the platform's ""killer feature"" has been its capacity to provide ""AI accuracy at scale without requiring messy data to be prepped or moved elsewhere.""
Why it's good:
""For us, the bet here is simple: there's an overconfidence crisis in AI,"" Gaurav Gupta, partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, told Business Insider. ""We believe 95% of AI companies will fail, and history will show that hallucinations were a major reason why. We think PromptQL is best positioned to solve this for enterprises.""
Total funding: $101 million
What it does:
Founded in 2020 by former Novartis executive Bianca Anghelina, Aily Labs builds an AI-powered ""decision intelligence"" platform designed to help Fortune 500 companies make decisions by consolidating data.
""I experienced firsthand how decisions are slowed down because of siloed data,"" Anghelina said. Traditional corporate decision-making is often delayed by ""processes that take weeks or months"" and ""data owned by different functions"" without ""one source of truth,"" she said.
Aily's ""AI brain"" aims to tackle these challenges by combining off-the-shelf and proprietary large language models, with data, to surface insights and recommendations ""in a matter of minutes rather than weeks,"" she said.
Unlike typical consulting firms, Aily isn't focused on one-off projects, but on embedding ""an always-on AI brain"" into a company's operations, she said.
Why it's good:
""Everyone's capturing information, but the question is: how are we actually using it to drive better decisions and efficiency?"" Pegah Ebrahimi, the cofounder and managing partner at FPV Ventures, which led Aily's latest $80 million funding round, told Business Insider.
Aily is like an ""executive partner that surfaces the top insights and risks relevant to your specific role — whether you're head of supply chain in Brazil or head of sales for North America,"" he added.
Total funding: $58.5 million
What it does:
In the AI era, companies are no longer agonizing about search engine optimization; they're fretting about how to get mentioned in generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT.
GEO, also known as generative engine optimization, is the process of optimizing content to boost its visibility in AI-driven searches.
Profound helps companies manage their geo strategy, including how they're mentioned in generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT. They also advise on how agents interface with a company's website and digital content, and analyze real-time search data to understand how consumers are working with generative AI chatbots.
Why it's good:
Thomson Nguyen, cofounder and managing partner at Saga Ventures — which invested in Profound's Series B round — told Business Insider by email that chief marketing officers at companies once hired brand consultants and marketing consultants to run focus groups to research and understand how their brand ranked among competitors.
Now, Profound offers a way to automate that work, Nguyen said.
Max Altman, another cofounder and managing partner at Saga, told Business Insider by email that ""Profound is the 800 lb. gorilla in the room, and clear category leader.""
Total funding: $6 million
What it does:
Dialogue AI, an AI-powered market research platform, aims to speed up the way companies conduct research — from designing studies and recruiting participants, to conducting interviews.
The company was founded by Benjamin Lo, Justin Hoang, and Hubert Chen — all of whom overlapped at Nextdoor, a social networking platform for neighborhoods.
The aim is to cut the turnaround time of a typical market research study from weeks to just a day, Lo previously told Business Insider.
""Maybe you're a designer or an engineer or a consultant, and you can basically conduct research independently with best practices. I think that's one of our visions — can we almost democratize market research?"" Hoang previously told Business Insider.
Why it's good:
""Market research as we know it is ripe for disruption,"" Faraz Fatemi, partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, which lead Dialogue's seed round, said in a press release announcing its new funding.
""Dialogue understands that teams across an organization, not just researchers, need fast, meaningful insights to do their jobs well. What they've built is both technically impressive and deeply thoughtful: a way to talk to customers at scale, without sacrificing depth or quality.""

Opposite of what Samsung had to do with its 2025 foldables, a new report claims it won't seek to craft its Galaxy Z Trifold in huge quantities.
This possibility was reported by The Elec (Korean), which states that Samsung isn't looking at hundreds of thousands of Trifolds, but rather a number shy of 50,000 (via Android Headlines). Supposedly, Samsung has contacted a supplier for the necessary components, but the purported amount may only be good for ~20,000 to ~30,000 Galaxy Z Trifold units.
The report adds that Samsung's trifold development will likely continue into December, where the publication's source claims ""suppliers are expecting an update.""
However, per its source, suppliers are hesitant to believe that Samsung will make another order for more components to craft more trifolds. Right now, it seems that Samsung is only looking to create an extremely limited number of Galaxy Z Trifolds, but the reason could be due to the market.
The publication adds that Samsung may start low to evaluate the phone's performance before thinking about more. We've heard something similar to this before, and there's likely another reason for the small amount.
 



Just yesterday (Nov 5), we were treated to the best look we've ever gotten of the Galaxy Z Trifold. In a leaked video, Samsung's device was reportedly on full display, revealing its highly anticipated design. It was stated that the unit in question featured a 6.5-inch folded display, which expands to 10 inches when the phone is fully unfolded. However, it seems as though the phone boasts some pretty thick bezels.
Overall, its alleged design very closely mirrors the Galaxy Z Fold 7. This is something we've seen rumored previously, and this video only leans more into that possibility. Speaking of the Fold 7, Samsung was scrambling earlier this year to make more, as consumers flocked toward the newest model.

Samsung was reported to have placed orders to create roughly 260,000 more Fold 7 units in September, a 60,000-unit jump from its original plan.
This is a stark difference between how it saw the Fold 7, and what's been rumored for the Trifold's low 20,000 to 30,000 (alleged) production plan. There are rumors that Samsung might skip the U.S. when it launches its Trifold, and the reason's pretty simple: pricing. There's speculation that the device could reach upwards of $2,500 in the U.S., and a price point like that would surely make consumers furrow their eyebrows.
Android Central's Jerry Hildenbrand also anticipates that there might be some issues with the Trifold, just on the basis that it will be a first-gen model. Hildenbrand also speculates that Samsung might keep the Trifold in Asian markets just as a test, considering the market is a mix of early adopters and simply curious folk.
Some rumors claim Samsung will debut the device late in 2025, though others say 2026 is more likely.

In the fast-emerging market for AI legal tools, a two-horse race is taking shape. Harvey, the OpenAI-backed startup that has become the industry's breakout success, is now facing an ambitious challenger: Stockholm-based Legora, which is pitching law firms a new way to protect and monetize their intellectual property.
Harvey has sprinted to $100 million in annual recurring revenue and an $8 billion valuation, turning the AI-for-law market into a serious money sport.
Legora, fresh off a $150 million funding round, is countering with workspace software that it says enables law firms to collaborate with clients and sell secure, private access to their documents and templates. Legora wants to give firms what they actually want: higher margins.
Fears are growing that corporate legal teams may take on more tasks they once sent to outside counsel. That's because the rise of generative artificial intelligence helps them do more with fewer resources.
Legora's pitch is that software helps law firms provide a better client experience and actually grow revenue. Its latest product, Portal, will enable firms to package their expertise behind a firm-branded workspace that clients can pay to use. Legora says Portal will centralize all legal work, replace email chains, and keep data out of AI training by default.
Max Junestrand, the former pro gamer now running Legora as CEO, came into legal as an outsider and built for speed and usability. Speaking to Business Insider over Zoom last week, he argued the company's edge is in bringing collaboration to legal work.
""Serving lawyers, you need to be extra-client-obsessed because they're used to doing that for their clients,"" Junestrand said. He put its mission this way: ""Our job is to make you win. If you win, we win.""
Legora is riding a tailwind as law firms scramble to test and adopt new tools in response to client demands for efficiency. The Stockholm-born startup closed a Series C funding round last week at a $1.8 billion valuation and says it has grown from 250 to over 400 customers across 40 markets.
Whether corporate legal teams will pay for a metered software portal is the question. Large enterprises are extremely sensitive to how firms handle their data because the same firm they use might also work with their rivals. Legora will have to answer how it handles conflicts when workflows encode firm knowledge.
Junestrand says Legora is up to the challenge. ""It's always been clear that we exist at the mercy of the work that our clients want to deliver,"" he said.
Legora isn't the first to build a law firm client portal. It's a bet that, unlike the legacy file-sharing systems of many legal firms — Thomson Reuters' HighQ, iManage Share, and NetDocuments — Portal moves beyond a glorified Google Drive. Legora bills the product as a monetizable surface for firm intellectual property and agentic workflows that clients can run themselves, while Legora's legal engineers tailor and maintain the setup.
Legora wouldn't say whether firms will charge clients by usage or subscription, or how Legora itself prices the portal. Harvey also partners with law firms to build bespoke software that clients pay to use, and Harvey itself takes a cut of the revenue. Harvey doesn't have a client portal and instead integrates with iManage and Microsoft's Sharepoint.
Legora has tapped firms from Big Law and the Big Four as early design partners. At Linklaters, one of London's elite ""Magic Circle"" law firms, attorney Greg Baker said he tested Portal on common deal scenarios, while MinterEllison CEO Virginia Briggs said the tool has potential to create ""real value for our clients."" Other design partners include Cleary Gottlieb, Goodwin, and Deloitte. General availability is planned for early 2026.

23,2025-11-07,"The standard iPhone 17 — the surprise hit of this year's iPhone series — has been sold out online since launch weekend. The base iPhone 17 didn't sell out as quickly as the iPhone 17 Pro Max, which saw shipping delays on Apple's online store within minutes of the start of preorders, but it went out of stock in the following days. Apple has struggled to meet demand since then. By late October, Apple managed to improve iPhone 17 supply in certain markets, but three models were still sold out in some regions. The first week of November brought additional stock improvements, but the base iPhone 17 remains sold out in the U.S., right alongside the iPhone 17 Pro Max.
BGR has been following iPhone 17 stock updates since preorders began, reporting shipping estimates every Friday. Our checks on November 7 show that the iPhone 17 models are largely available in all the markets we've been following since September 12. As a reminder, we've performed the same inventory checks that Apple's local websites support. We've simulated the iPhone purchase process for each of the four models, looking at all possible color and storage combinations. These checks are based only on the data Apple makes public online. The shipping estimates show up on the iPhone order page according to Apple's internal stock management system, which nobody has access to. Apple's online store doesn't mention how many units are available for a specific market, so the delivery estimates may change throughout the day.
The iPhone Pro and Pro Max models are typically the first to sell out, and Apple often struggles to meet demand in the weeks following a new release. The iPhone 17 Pros have been sold out in many markets over the past few weeks, with Apple catching up to demand only recently. As you'll see below, BGR's November 7 checks show the iPhone 17 Pro is in stock in all the markets we check every Friday, just like the iPhone Air. On that note, the iPhone Air was only briefly sold out, and only in specific markets (Japan and China). What's interesting this week is that the U.S. seems to be the only market where iPhone 17 Pro Max and iPhone 17 supply is significantly constrained:
The iPhone 17 Pro Max will ship to buyers who place an online order on Friday in 1-2 weeks. That's faster than the 256GB iPhone 17 models (all colors), which have a 2-3 week wait time. The 512GB iPhone 17 has a 1-2 week shipping estimate as well. These checks indicate that the $799 iPhone 17 (the 256GB variant) is a strong offer this year. As we explained, the standard iPhone 17 is nearly as capable as the iPhone 17 Pro — a first for Apple."

Gen Zers and millennials are cutting back on dining out, hurting America's biggest fast-casual chains.
Chipotle, Cava, and Sweetgreen reported earnings in the last two weeks, and all three reported the same problem: Diners age 25 to 35 are visiting their stores less frequently as they pinch pennies.
The chains offering what's colloquially called slop bowls became a hit in the US for diners seeking something fresher, more customizable, and healthier than fast food with quick service.
Now, unemployment, lower spending power, and high living costs are dragging down younger customers. Dining out is the first thing they cut back on, according to an October study by TD Cowen.
The customer squeeze adds to the existing list of problems that these chains are facing, including being priced out by fast food chains like McDonald's.
Investors are taking note: Chipotle, Cava, and Sweetgreen's stock all slumped in after-hours trading after their earnings reports. In the last month, Chipotle is down 26%, Cava is down 27%, and Sweetgreen is down 21%.
Andrew Barish, a senior equity research analyst at Jefferies, told Business Insider the solution is more than just slashing prices.
Chipotle's CEO, Scott Boatwright, said on an October 29 earnings call that the 25 to 35 age group is facing financial issues ""including unemployment, increased student loan repayment, and slower real wage growth.""
He said they were patronizing Chipotle less.
""We're not losing them to the competition. We're losing them to grocery and food at home,"" Boatwright said.
""They feel the pinch, we feel the pullback from them as well,"" he added.
Cava's CEO, Brett Schulman, echoed Chipotle's concerns on a Tuesday earnings call.
""We recognize that today's environment is creating real pressures for consumers, especially younger guests who are making more deliberate choices about where they spend.""
Sweetgreen's finance chief, Jamie McConnell, said on a Thursday earnings call that spending from the 25 to 35 age group, which makes up about 30% of the chain's consumer base, was down 15% in the recent quarter.
The group was ""most under pressure,"" McConnell said.
Barish, the Jefferies analyst, said that intense promotions in restaurants, such as Chili's $10.99 ""3 for Me"" meal and McDonald's $8 Big Mac Extra Value meal in September, were squeezing slop bowl chains.
When Business Insider tried meals from Chipotle, Cava, and Sweetgreen in September, they cost $19.01, $28.97, and $29.01, respectively, including drinks and sides.
Jean-Pierre Lacroix, the president of brand strategy firm SLD, told Business Insider in September, ""If I'm going to spend an extra $4 or $5 to go to Chipotle or Cava versus McDonald's, that value still needs to be there — it just needs to be a different type of value.""
""They need to find that balance and provide value while creating something unique that is memorable and shareable,"" Lacroix said in September.
Schulman, Cava's CEO, pushed back during this week's earnings call on criticism that the chain was selling unaffordable meals.
""Well, the reality is you can get a chicken fillet at Cava with all the toppings included — three different spreads, greens, and grains — for $10.65 to our highest price of $12.95 in New York City,"" Schulman said. ""So that's a sub-$13 bowl in the most expensive market, not a $20 lunch.""
Fixing the Gen Z and millennial problem requires more than just lowering prices.
Barish said that the chains need to get consumers excited with menu innovation and good marketing.
""I don't think either Chipotle or Sweetgreen really has that, but Cava is on trend,"" he said, citing Cava's new chicken shawarma option.
He added, ""Value is more than just price; it includes quality, variety, customization, service, and ambience, which fast-casual can deliver when done right.""
A Chipotle spokesperson told Business Insider the chain is exploring ""new and creative ways to emphasize our value proposition.""
The company is looking to improve its execution in stores, innovate its menu, and double down on its rewards program, the spokesperson said.
On an August earnings call, Sweetgreen CEO Jonathan Neman announced a turnaround plan to get customers back in the door, including 25% larger portions of chicken and tofu, recipe upgrades, and $13 salads for members.
Representatives for Cava and Sweetgreen did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

When it comes to earning a living, you might want to be more like Elon.
There are some strategy lessons to be learned from the world's richest man, who just won a pay package worth up to $1 trillion at Tesla — even for those of us whose paychecks come with fewer zeros.Of course, most people can't go work at their rocket company if their promotion or job offer doesn't come through. However, a scaled-down version of some of the methods Musk and the Tesla board used could work for mere mortals.It comes down to knowing your worth, framing a pay agreement as a win-win, and, if you can, treating a compensation discussion as a negotiation, not just a plea for more money, career advisors told Business Insider.
To start, workers need to understand their leverage. In a lackluster job market, you might not feel like you have much to bargain with. Yet if you have an offer from another employer or some other option that would let you walk away, you have latitude, said Alan Stein, CEO of Kadima Careers, which offers coaching for getting six-figure jobs.
""If you understand what your plan B is, then that gives you a lot of power,"" he said.
A viable backup plan — sometimes called a BATNA, or a best alternative to a negotiated agreement — can mean you're asking for something from a position of strength, Stein said.
Your leverage could just be that you're invaluable to your employer. If that's you, then your boss might recognize that things would fall apart if you leave. It's what employers often refer to as ""key person risk,"" said John Gates, founder of Salary Coach, which helps executives negotiate their pay.
""As you get to the point where there's only one of you in a company, that's when the elbow room appears,"" he said.
That's similar to how many, including Tesla's board, appear to view Musk, who has a stable of companies to which he could decamp if he were to leave Tesla. ""He's a unique rainmaker within Tesla,"" Gates said.
On Thursday, Tesla shareholders voted to award Musk $1 trillion in compensation if he meets a series of goals.
The opposite holds true as well: If you're one of many workers doing something similar, Gates said, your bargaining chip is likely going to be smaller.
Even if you are your company's golden goose or you have a shiny new offer from a competitor, it's not necessarily advisable to walk into your boss's office and flaunt it, he said. Most people aren't Musk, after all.
Gates said there is a danger, however, in showing an offer to your employer because it signals that you're poised to leave.
""The average executive would be running a tremendous risk with that approach,"" he said. ""It brings your loyalty into question.""
Gates said that a better way would be to say something like, ""I've had several calls from headhunters or other companies interested in my background. The numbers that they're throwing at me are kind of surprising, but I really like working here."" Then, he said, you can make clear that the offers are becoming a distraction and that you'd like to discuss your compensation.
Musk's new compensation plan is directly tied to numerous milestones, including his ability to boost Tesla's valuation from about $1.5 trillion to $8.5 trillion by 2035 and deliver 20 million vehicles and one million Optimus robots.
Similarly, if you're negotiating a job offer or a pay bump, you can ask to tie some of that to a specific goal. It's a way to align incentives, Gates said, so that ""everybody's making more money together.""
Being able to say, ""I contributed to this,"" or ""I made this happen,"" makes it easier to say, ""This is why I'm worth what I'm asking for,"" said Patrice Lindo, CEO of Career Nomad, a platform that helps professionals navigate career changes.
Your compensation goes beyond your paycheck, and so can the discussions you have with your employer. Like Musk, who has been seeking to get paid through awards in Tesla shares, you can ask for things like company stock, a signing bonus, added vacation time, or even a deferred start date, Lindo said.
By regularly documenting your successes, it's easier to talk about them when it comes time to discuss your pay, she said. Lindo encourages workers to keep notes on their accomplishments — what she calls a ""value tracker"" — so that they can keep score. Then, when it's time to sit down with your boss to go over your performance and pay, you have the evidence you need, Lindo said.
After all, she said, ""Every raise that you get is a referendum on how well you branded your impact.""

Ripple’s Swell 2025 conference in New York may have delivered one of the most defining moments in the digital asset industry’s relationship with Wall Street. The XRP community, in particular, got its long-awaited validation.
During a keynote session, Maxwell Stein of BlackRock’s digital assets team told the audience that “the market is ready for large-scale blockchain adoption” and that infrastructure from Ripple could soon move trillions of dollars on-chain.
Stein praised early industry builders like Ripple for proving blockchain’s real-world utility, not just as a speculative concept but as a functioning layer of financial infrastructure.
“They’ve already tokenized fixed income, bonds, stablecoins… that’s where it started. But this is the rails for trillions in capital flows,” said Stein.
 A BlackRock executive publicly crediting Ripple for helping prove blockchain’s real-world functionality marked a milestone in the narrative XRP holders have championed for years.
For a community that has long argued Ripple’s technology will underpin institutional liquidity, the comment landed like a thunderclap.
For the longest time, the XRP community has clung to the belief that Ripple’s technology will serve as the bridge between traditional finance and the decentralized economy.
Upon Stein’s statement, the XRP supporters across X (Twitter) saw the remark as long-awaited validation from the world’s largest asset manager.
🚨BREAKING: BlackRock Exec at Ripple Swell: “The Market Is Ready — Trillions Are Coming On-Chain” 💥This might’ve been the most electric moment of @Ripple Swell 2025.Maxwell Stein, a representative from @BlackRock, took the stage and straight-up said what everyone’s been… pic.twitter.com/OpuysMrq47
“We’ve seen what early adopters of crypto have done — they’ve shown us what’s possible. And now, the market is ready for broader adoption,” he added.
His statement highlighted a shift in tone from TradFi, that blockchain is no longer an experiment. Rather, it is an emerging standard.
However, the excitement that followed was tempered by legal caution. Australian lawyer and renowned XRP advocate Bill Morgan was among the first to raise questions about Stein’s remarks. He wondered whether they reflected an official BlackRock position or were simply Stein’s personal opinion.
“Very interesting, but… was he speaking in a personal capacity or for BlackRock?” Morgan posted on X.
The question resonated deeply because of what’s at stake. If Stein’s statement signals BlackRock’s strategic confidence in tokenized finance, it could mark one of the clearest indications yet that institutional adoption is imminent.
If personal, it remains a powerful, but unofficial endorsement of Ripple and blockchain’s direction by extension.
In the same event, Nasdaq President and CEO Adena Friedman said the digital asset market is clearly maturing. However, she also acknowledged that regulatory clarity is essential for full-scale institutional participation.
“To get them really engaged in the market, there has to be regulatory clarity,” she emphasized, noting that banks are already experimenting with tokenized bonds and stablecoin frameworks.
Together, the remarks from Stein and Friedman painted a picture of convergence, where TradFi, blockchain, and regulation are aligning.
Ripple’s Swell 2025 conference, once an industry event primarily for crypto insiders, became a stage where some of the most influential voices in global finance signaled readiness for integration.
Despite these developments, along with the network’s growing institutional deals and exploding XRP adoption, the Ripple price remains lull.
In the last 24 hours, the XRP price has been down by over 4%. It was trading for $2.21 as of this writing.

On Thursday, Samourai Wallet co-founder Keonne Rodriguez received a five-year prison sentence after being convicted of charges that his wallet software allowed criminals to launder millions of dollars worth of bitcoin. This was the maximum sentence Rodriguez could receive for the associated charges.
The sentence was handed down just a couple of weeks after Binance co-founder Chengpang âCZâ Zhao was pardoned by President Trump of charges related to money laundering during his time at the crypto exchange.
Judge Cote: His business marketed itself to the criminal world. He literally laundered criminal money. There is no recognition of the human suffering that was facilitated by the defendant. Pending sentence he's been engaged in a project to recover money from hacks
— Inner City Press (@innercitypress) November 6, 2025

According to prosecutors, Samourai Wallet had two features, Ricochet and Whirlpool, that enhanced user privacy and helped criminals launder funds. While many Bitcoin users have claimed Samourai Wallet was nothing more than open-source software, there was some degree of centralization involved at times, and Samourai servers also collected fees despite operating in a non-custodial manner.
Another key point brought up by the prosecution throughout the trial (and when the initial charges were announced) was Samourai Walletâs social media activities, particularly on X, where the use of Samourai Wallet by criminals was promoted.
On top of the five-year prison sentence, Rodriguez also received a $250,000 fine and three years of supervised release. Rodriguezâs fellow co-founder, William Lonergan Hill, is still awaiting sentencing.
According to The Rage, Rodriguez pled guilty to a subsection of the money transmission licensing law related to the knowing transmission of proceeds from illicit activities. This was the same law Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm was convicted of violating earlier this year.
Tornado Cash is a decentralized application (dapp) on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to similarly mix their funds in an effort to gain a higher degree of crypto privacy. As a dapp on the Ethereum blockchain, there was perhaps even less argument for any sort of point of centralization in that case.
Assistant Attorney General Galeotti gave an encouraging but incomplete speech at the AIP summit today. The highlight is a commitment to respect FinCEN guidance on non-custodial software development going forward. Thatâs good to hear. But Coin Center has some questions.
He said,â¦
— Peter Van Valkenburgh (@valkenburgh) August 21, 2025

Notably, the U.S. Treasury Departmentâs Financial Crime Enforcement Network (FinCEN) told prosecutors that Samourai Wallet likely did not qualify as a money services business (MSB) due to its non-custodial structure six months prior to charges being filed against the wallet developers.
Additionally, in August, U.S. Department of Justice Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division Matthew Galeotti indicated new charges would not be brought against developers of crypto software that âis truly decentralized and solely automates peer-to-peer transactions, and where a third-party does not have custody and control over user assets.â
While Trump claimed he would operate as the Crypto President during his second term in office, protections for node operators and developers have still not been enshrined in federal law. Instead, an executive order that discusses protections for non-custodial crypto developers is the only action that has been taken thus far.
The GENIUS Act was passed earlier this year; however, this legislation was focused almost entirely on stablecoins, which the Trump administration views as a way of protecting the dominance of the U.S. dollar throughout the world. A bill associated with structuring the crypto market from a regulatory perspective, known as the Clarity Act, was originally expected to pass before the end of the year, but itâs unclear what will be included in the bill and whether Congress will even be able to get to it amidst the government shutdown and other delays.
Coin Center, which is a crypto advocacy group in Washington, made a blog post this week about the importance of the protections for developers found in the House version of the Clarity Act to remain in the Senate version of the bill as well.
âThese are fundamental and reasonable limitations on who should have an obligation to go get permission before they engage in certain activities relating to digital commodities,â wrote Coin Centerâs Peter Van Valkenburgh. âNobody wants the publishers of mere wallet software to be treated as if they hold the financial assets of those who use their software to hold their own assets (Â§409(6)). Nobody wants the core developers of Bitcoin or Ethereum to have to get permission before they suggest and publish new versions of the protocol code (Â§409(4)).â
It's pretty disturbing that we're watching a fund linked directly to the president accumulate every shitcoin under the sun presumably in preparation to announce extremely favorable policy that will pump his bags, and almost no one in charge is pushing back against the ethics.
— ðððð (@TXMCtrades) January 23, 2025

The question of priorities for the Trump administration must be raised when centralized crypto exchange operators are getting pardoned and SEC cases against peddlers of dubious tokens are being dropped, while at the same time, crypto wallet and app developers are given prison sentences.
If better protections for those who are simply writing or using software are not included in the Clarity Act, it will further solidify Trumpâs role as âThe Shitcoin Presidentâ who is mainly interested in using this technology to further empower himself and his family, whether it be by accepting money from the crypto lobby or profiting off his own familyâs crypto schemes.

For Tesla's board and many investors, CEO Elon Musk and Tesla's success are closely linked. Now that a vote on a record-setting pay package for Musk is settled, the bulls are crowing and the naysayers are alarmed.
On Thursday, 75% of Tesla shareholders voted to approve Musk's proposed $1 trillion CEO pay package, contingent on meeting specific performance metrics over the next decade.
""What we're about to embark upon is not merely a new chapter of the future of Tesla, but a whole new book,"" Musk said on the neon-lit stage after the vote, while an Optimus robot danced behind him.
""Time to pull a LOT of rabbits out of the hat,"" Musk added on X late Thursday night.
Tesla's stock rose 2% after hours following the announcement of the vote.
Here's how analysts and investors reacted to the shareholder approval of Musk's $1 trillion pay package.
Tesla's bulls expressed optimism after the outcome of the vote.
Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, wrote in a note on Friday that there are ""logical reasons"" the vote passed convincingly, given the demanding targets that must first be met.
Musk has to achieve 12 ambitious milestones, including delivering 20 million Tesla cars and one million robots, increasing its market value from $1.4 trillion to $8.5 trillion, and introducing one million Robotaxis into commercial use.
""In this sense there was little to lose for most Tesla holders in approving the deal,"" Mould said. ""If Musk does get the $1 trillion, shareholders will have done very nicely indeed.""
Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said that the vote cements Musk as a ""wartime CEO"" who will lead Tesla through an AI revolution.
""With this pay package now voted positively, keeping Tesla's biggest asset, Musk, as its leader for the foreseeable future, we continue to believe that the AI valuation is getting unlocked,"" he wrote in a note on Thursday.
However, Ives also highlighted that because of the difficult targets agreed on, the $1 trillion pay package is no sure thing.
Gene Munster, a veteran Tesla analyst and managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said that the vote was a win for Tesla investors for two reasons.
""First, it gives Elon the control and financial carrot he wanted, which means he will stay engaged at Tesla,"" he wrote in a blog post on Thursday.
And second: ""Investors sent a message to Elon: we are with you. That means when Tesla has a rough quarter, the stock likely won't get punished as much as expected.""
Investors and an EV watch group said the outcome was a show of poor accountability and reduced independence at the company.
Norges Bank Investment Management, which has a stake of about $11.6 billion in Tesla, voted against the pay package. The manager of the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund said in a rationale about its voting intentions that it was ""concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk- consistent with our views on executive compensation."" The fund declined to comment when contacted by Business Insider on Friday.
SOC Investment Group, an investor consortium that urged stockholders to vote against the pay plan, said Thursday's vote reaffirms the ""deep concerns"" shareholders have about Tesla's corporate governance.
""Musk's outsized influence at Tesla is on full display,"" the group said in a Thursday statement. ""From paid social media campaigns and TV advertisements to hiring a consultant to conduct proxy solicitations, Tesla took extraordinary measures to set up this vote in Musk's favor.""
It added: ""True innovation and growth at the company must be guided by strong governance, independent oversight, and transparent accountability—not by throwing money at the problem and concentrating more power in the hands of a single executive.""
The New York State Comptroller, which holds shares in Tesla through the New York State Common Retirement Fund, wrote that Tesla's governance has drifted away from accountability.
""This is pay for unchecked power, not pay for performance,"" New York state comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said in a statement on Thursday.
""The board has rewarded distraction and entrenched a CEO who answers to no one,"" he added.
Industry watchdog Safe Autonomous Vehicles Everywhere said it was alarmed by the vote's outcome.
""Autonomous vehicles can potentially save lives and be a transformative technology, but only if they're deployed responsibly,"" Shua Sanchez, the national campaign director at SAVE, told Business Insider in a statement.
""This pay plan creates a dangerous financial incentive to rush partially-autonomous vehicles and robotaxis onto public roads before they're proven safe. Nothing in this pay plan incentivizes safety,"" he added.

30,2025-11-07,"A Brazilian hairdresser Larissa Nery, who has been making headlines in India this week after her photograph was splashed over the news in an allegation about alleged election fraud, has told the BBC she initially thought it was all a mistake. Or a prank.
But then her social media blew up and people started tagging her on Instagram.
""At first it was a few random messages. I thought they were mistaking me for someone else,"" she told the BBC. ""Then they sent me the video where my face appeared on a big screen. I thought it was AI or some joke. But then lots of people started messaging at the same time and I realised it was real.""
Nery, who lives in Belo Horizonte, capital city of southeastern Brazil's Minas Gerais state, and has never been to India, says she searched on Google to understand what was going on.
What had happened was the fallout of a press conference by Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday where he accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party BJP and the Election Commission (EC) of committing voter fraud in last year's election in Haryana state. The BJP has denied the allegations. 
Hours after the press conference, in a post on X, the Chief Electoral Officer of Haryana shared a letter they said they had sent to Gandhi in August asking him to sign an oath with the names of ineligible voters ""so that necessary proceedings could be initiated"". They did not respond to the specific allegations he made and did not comment on Nery's case. The BBC has reached out to the poll panel for response.
Gandhi has made a series of accusations of ""vote theft"" against the poll panel since early August.
In his latest claims, he said his team had looked through the Election Commission's voter list data and found that of the approximately 20 million voters, 2.5 million were irregular entries - including duplicates, bulk voters and invalid addresses. He blamed his party's loss in the Haryana election on this alleged manipulation of the voters' list.
To prove his claims, he showed a number of slides on a big screen. One of them showed Gandhi standing in front of a big image of Nery, while another showed a compilation of 22 voters with different names and addresses but all with her photos.
""Who is this lady? How old is she? She votes 22 times in Haryana,"" Gandhi said.
He explained that a single stock photo of a woman, taken by Brazilian photographer Matheus Ferrero, had been used repeatedly across multiple voter entries under different names. He described Nery as a model who had appeared on the voters' list under many names, including Seema, Sweety and Saraswati.
The 29-year-old confirmed to the BBC that it was indeed her in the photograph. ""Yes. It is me. Much younger, but it is me. I am the person in the images."" 
She clarified that she was a hairdresser and not a model and that the photo was taken in March 2017 when she was 21, just outside her home. The photographer, she said, ""thought I was pretty and asked to take photos of me"".
Now years later, all the attention in the past two days from ""people from India, many of them journalists"", has left her scared.
""I became scared. I cannot tell if it is dangerous for me or if speaking about it could harm someone there. I do not know who is right or wrong because I do not know the parties involved,"" she said.
""I did not go to work in the morning because I could not even see messages from my clients. Many journalists were calling me. They found the number of the place where I work. 
""I had to remove the salon name from my profile because they were disturbing my workplace. My boss even spoke to me. Some people treat it like a meme, but it is affecting me professionally.""
Matheus Ferrero, who took Nery's photo, is also overwhelmed by the sudden attention. Until recently, he says India meant only Caminho das Índias - the 2009 Brazilian primetime show - to him.
He's still trying to make sense of the events of the last few days in a country thousands of miles away.
Some people had reached out to him from India a week back, asking him who the woman in the photo was, he told the BBC.
""I didn't reply. I'm not going to give someone's name like that. And I hadn't seen this friend in years,"" he told the BBC. ""I thought it was a scam. I blocked and reported it.""
But since Gandhi's press conference, ""things have exploded"".
""People were calling me on Instagram and Facebook. It was terrible. I deactivated my Instagram to try to understand what was going on. Later I googled it and realised what was happening, but at first I had no idea.""
Ferrero says some websites put his pictures next to the Nery's photo without permission. ""People were making memes, like turning it into a game show joke. It's absurd.""
In 2017, Ferrero was just starting out as a photographer when he invited Nery, who he knew, to come out for a photoshoot. Ferrero said he shared the photos on his Facebook and also posted them on Unsplash - a photo website - with her consent.
""The photo blew up… reached around 57 million views,"" he said.
He has now deleted the link from his Unsplash account but he sent us screenshots taken earlier that showed other photos of Nery from the same shoot.
""I deleted them out of fear, because the photos were being misused. I got scared imagining this happening to other people I photographed. I felt invaded. A lot of random people coming at me. You think 'Did I do something wrong?' But I didn't. The platform was open and I uploaded like millions of others."" He's also now made the original Facebook post with her photos private.
""When you see people entering your Twitter, Facebook, personal Instagram, you panic. The first reaction is to shut everything down and understand later. Some people thought it was funny, like a soap opera, but I felt invaded.""
Neither Ferrero nor Nery have ever been to India and are still trying to understand how something that happened at the other end of the world could turn their lives upside down.
We asked Ferrero if all this helped uncover electoral fraud, would that be positive?
""Yes, I think that would be positive. But I don't really know the details,"" he said.
Nery who has never left the country says: ""This is far from my reality. I do not even follow elections in Brazil, let alone in another country.""

The mechanical keyboard market has split into factions that rarely speak to each other. Gaming boards chase millisecond advantages with features most people will never configure, while design-focused options prioritize clean lines at the expense of functionality. Premium keyboards exist in both categories, but they seldom bridge the gap between looking appropriate in a minimalist workspace and delivering the kind of technical depth that competitive players actually use.
The Lemokey L1 HE addresses this gap with a CNC-milled aluminum chassis that weighs nearly two kilograms and looks deliberate rather than flashy. Available in white with yellow accents, black, or silver, the 75% layout includes macro keys and a programmable roller on the left side that defaults to volume control but accepts custom assignments. The metal construction and clean lines work on desks where aesthetics matter.
Designer: Lemokey (Keychron)







The switches underneath are where things get interesting. Gateron’s double-rail magnetic switches use Hall Effect sensors instead of physical contact points, which sounds technical until you realize what it enables. Every key’s activation point adjusts from feather-light to deliberate across a 3.6mm range. Set your movement keys to hair-trigger sensitivity. Configure typing keys deeper so resting fingers don’t accidentally fire off characters. The keyboard adapts to how you work rather than forcing adaptation the other way.






Press a key partway, and one action triggers. Press deeper, and a different command fires. Deeper still, another. Release at the right depth and a fourth activates. This isn’t theoretical; it changes how certain games and workflows operate once you stop thinking in binary keypresses. Walking versus running becomes pressure instead of separate keys. Multi-key shortcuts collapse into single presses with varying depth. Finger gymnastics get replaced by pressure control.

Switching to analog mode turns the keyboard into something closer to a controller. Racing games suddenly respond to how deeply you press acceleration keys, not just whether they’re pressed at all. The magnetic switches detect these pressure variations smoothly enough that steering feels genuine rather than approximated. People who prefer keyboards over controllers gain functionality that previously required switching input methods entirely.


The web-based configurator runs through any modern browser without installation, working identically across operating systems. Remapping happens quickly. Macros are built through straightforward menus. The keyboard connects wirelessly at 1000Hz polling for gaming or switches between three Bluetooth devices for productivity. Battery lasts long enough that charging becomes a weekly task rather than a daily concern.


Typing produces sounds that feel dampened and substantial rather than hollow or sharp. Multiple foam layers and gasket mounting create that quality, along with stabilizers that keep larger keys smooth. The double-shot PBT keycaps handle daily wear without developing shine, and the metal body prevents any flex during aggressive typing sessions. RGB lighting exists but stays subdued enough not to dominate the aesthetic.

The L1 HE occupies unusual territory between gaming keyboards and professional boards. It delivers rapid trigger modes and analog control alongside a build quality and appearance that work in spaces where RGB unicorn vomit would draw complaints. The programmable roller, magnetic switches, and four-action keys make it technically ambitious, while the design keeps it visually restrained.

NintendoSwitch 2 
The Switch 2’s controversial price tag didn’t stop it from becoming the fastest-selling console at launch ever. Will it stay $450 or break the $500 barrier due to tariffs and inflation? In what should come as some small relief, Nintendo recently signaled that fans don’t have to worry about a price hike in the near future.
“We believe that we’ll be able to maintain the current level of profitability for hardware for the time being unless there are significant changes in external factors, such as a shift in tariff assumptions, or other unexpected events,” Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa told investors in a recent Q&A. “While we are aware that the costs of various materials are rising, we also anticipate some areas where cost reduction may be achieved for Nintendo Switch 2 through ongoing mass production efforts.”
He continued, “Therefore, currently we do not expect the recent rise in material costs to greatly impact profitability. We will continue our efforts to maintain the same level of profitability as we currently have.”
Good news, right?
While fans flooded Nintendo livestream chats with demands that the company lower its prices, $450 ended up being squarely in the middle of what experts had predicted. It was higher than the aggressively low end of $400 and under the worst-case scenario of $500. Some analysts also suspected that the price tag included a cushion to absorb some of the blow from Trump’s tariffs on countries where the console is manufactured, like Vietnam.
As a result, while the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and even the original Switch all received unprecedented price hikes earlier this year, the Switch 2 has remained consistent at its launch price. The other bit of good news is that Nintendo actually manufactured enough stock to make sure just about everyone who wanted one could get one. That’s meant zero haggling with scalpers on reseller sites like eBay and Facebook Marketplace, a refreshing change from the early days of the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S back during the pandemic.
But I also wouldn’t expect the Switch 2 to come down in price until…well, probably ever. We never saw the original Switch get a price drop, and this one is selling even better. Nintendo has said it’s happy to keep manufacturing that earlier console, too, as long as it keeps selling, which it continues to do.

Gaming laptops donât come cheap. Of course, the exact price depends on the specs youâre after, but machines that can handle the latest titles without slowing down often land in the $800 to $1,700 range. If youâve been on the lookout for a solid option without blowing your budget, Amazon is making the upgrade easy.
We just spotted the 16-inch Kaigerr gaming laptop going for $490 on Amazon, after an unbelievable 71% drop, and no, itâs not a glitch. Itâs an early Black Friday deal available to both Prime and non-Prime members. Hurry to grab yourself this powerhouse, as thereâs no telling how long the discount or the stock will last.
See at Amazon
Youâre getting an impressive 16-inch display, which is slightly larger than most standard screens in this range, and pushes brilliant visuals that are both sharp and vivid. The High-Definition IPS screen is bright while also being comfortable on the eyes, so whether youâre pushing some creative boundaries in the morning or streaming at night, you will enjoy an immersive viewing experience throughout. Thereâs also a backlight keyboard that makes it easy to type in dim settings.
Power-wise, it packs a Ryzen 7 5825U processor with 8 cores and 16 threads, clocking up to 4.5GHz. This translates into ultra-fast performance, even with resource-intensive apps. The processor is paired with 16GB of DDR4 RAM and a 512GB NVMe SSD, so youâre getting both speed and sufficient storage right out of the box. These specs should be enough for most users out there initially, but if you ever want more, the laptop supports up to 64GB of RAM and 2TB of SSD expansion.
Graphics are handled by the Radeon Vega 8 integrated GPU, which keeps everything running smoothly. Itâs not really meant for ultra-high-end titles at max settings, but youâll have no problem running popular games like Fortnite or Minecraft.
Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth, plus a bunch of ports like USB 3.2, HDMI, a full-function Type-C, a TF card slot, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. You can connect external displays, add essential peripherals, and more without feeling limited.
All things considered, this gaming laptop delivers a lot of value for under $500. Youâll enjoy fast performance, immersive visuals, massive storage, plus quality graphics, whether youâre playing, working, or streaming. If you have been wanting to treat yourself to a powerful machine, now is a great time to make the move.

Anyone who’s worked with flexible 3D printing filaments knows their limitations; TPU and TPE only go so far, and nothing on the desktop market has matched the heat resistance and elasticity of real silicone. We’ve been stuck making parts that feel rubbery but fail the moment they get too warm or need to seal properly. That’s all changed with the arrival of Prusa’s new XL printhead, developed in collaboration with Filament2. This toolhead uses a pioneering dual-filament system to produce actual, industrial-grade silicone prints, a feat that moves desktop printing into a whole new category of material science.
Instead of extruding a simple thermoplastic, this system feeds two liquid-core filaments into the nozzle, where their outer sheaths are stripped away. The liquid silicone components are then mixed and cured in real time as they are deposited. This is not some rubber-like substitute; it is genuine silicone with all its useful properties, created right on the print bed of a standard Prusa XL. The elegance of containing the entire two-part mixing process within a clean, self-contained filament and toolhead system is a massive engineering win, solving the mess and complexity that has kept liquid printing out of reach for most people until now.
Designer: Prusa







This method completely sidesteps the need for the clumsy pumps and reservoirs seen in previous experimental liquid printers. The genius is in the filament itself. By encasing the two liquid parts in a stable sheath, Filament2 has created something that handles just like a standard spool of PLA. The printhead does the heavy lifting, performing a micro-scale version of what you would do with a two-part epoxy, but with incredible precision. You get the benefits of a reactive polymer without the hazardous mess, which opens up a world of possibilities for creating functional, end-use parts, not just look-alike prototypes.







Think about the immediate applications for this technology. In the automotive world, the ability to print custom, one-off silicone gaskets, seals, and vibration dampeners is a game changer for restoration and prototyping. No more waiting weeks for a custom mold or settling for a close-enough part. For product designers, this means creating truly functional prototypes with soft-touch grips, flexible waterproof seals, and even custom ergonomic components for wearables. Because silicone is skin-safe and can be sterilized, it also opens up possibilities for custom medical models and assistive devices. We are talking about end-use parts, not just look-alike models.


The choice to launch this on the Prusa XL platform is also incredibly clever. The XL’s main selling point is its automatic tool-changing capability, which suddenly makes it the perfect machine for true multi-material fabrication. You could print a rigid nylon housing with one toolhead, then have the printer automatically swap to the silicone head to print integrated waterproof seals and vibration-dampening feet onto the same part in a single, uninterrupted job. This elevates the machine from a multi-color printer to a genuine multi-property manufacturing station. It’s a level of automation and material integration that was previously reserved for machines costing tens of thousands of dollars.

Now, it’s important to keep expectations grounded. This will not be as simple or cheap as printing with standard PLA. The specialized filament from Filament2 will undoubtedly carry a premium price, and I anticipate a learning curve. The process requires incredible precision; any imbalance in the mixing ratio or inconsistency in the liquid cores could lead to failed prints where the silicone doesn’t cure properly. We still need to see long-term reliability data and learn about the maintenance requirements for a printhead that handles what are essentially reactive adhesives. Still, even as a niche application, it pushes the entire industry forward by showing what’s possible when you rethink the entire printing process, from the filament spool to the nozzle tip.

With the holidays quickly approaching, we’re all up to our knees in gift shopping. If you’re looking for some easy corporate sponsored White Elephant gifts or perhaps an extra stocking stuffer to fill up the sock, look for something that everyone and their mother could take advantage of. I’m talking about a portable power bank. Anker has myriad of portable chargers in its product lineup, consisting of all different sizes (both physical and in the storage sense).
As the tech has gotten better, prices have come down so you can get something really reliable for dirt cheap â especially when there is a sale. Right now, Amazon has this travel-ready Anker power bank with a 10,000mAh capacity for 40% off: The Anker PowerCore is normally priced at $29 (which isn’t even all that expensive) and it is now available for just $15.
See at Amazon
Like it says in the name, this Anker PowerCore Slim 10000 power bank holds a total power capacity of 10,000mAh. If you’re not familiar with these units, let’s put it a bit more eloquently. This portable charger can provide an iPhone 17 with two full charges from zero to 100%. Likewise, it can bring a Galaxy S25 to 100% just barely under two times. It can also bring an iPad mini 6 back to full one time.
The Anker power bank is lightweight and slim in design. It can easily fit into any pocket or into any bag you may be traveling with. It measures in at 5.99 inches by 2.81 inches 0.61 inches. It’s got a scratch-resistant exterior, so don’t be afraid to put it in your bag with other stuff. It’s been durability tested to withstand a drop of up to 3.2 feet.
The power bank uses USB-C for both input and output, which makes charging quick and easy for any USB-C device. It comes with the USB-C capable for you to charge both your devices like your phone or tablet as well as to recharge the power bank itself. It also has a micro USB port which can be used for recharging the power bank as an alternative.
The USB-C port supports speeds of up to 15W in either direction. That’s not the fastest charging on the market, but this can still save you in a pinch if you’re in Penn Station, phones about to die, and you still need to figure what address you’re going to and train you’re taking. Afterall, remember. This thing is only $15. For what it can do, it’s an excellent deal at that price point.

Russia's vital oil and gas revenues tumbled 27% in October from a year earlier, data from the Finance Ministry show — a sharp blow to the Kremlin's wartime finances just as new US sanctions tighten the screws on its energy exports.
Moscow collected 888.6 billion rubles, or $10.9 billion, in oil and gas taxes, down from about 1.2 trillion rubles in October 2024, official data published on Thursday show. The steep decline came amid weak crude prices, a stronger ruble, and tightening Western sanctions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Over the first 10 months of 2025, oil and gas revenues totaled 7.5 trillion rubles, down from 9.5 trillion in the same period last year — a drop of more than 2 trillion rubles, or 21%.
That pressure is set to intensify. In late October, the US Treasury Department sanctioned the financial arms of Rosneft and Lukoil, Russia's largest oil companies, which together account for around 3 million barrels per day — nearly half of the country's seaborne oil exports.
Although there were initial concerns that the new restrictions might tighten global supply and push up prices, markets have largely shrugged them off after an initial spike.
US West Texas Intermediate futures are trading around $60 a barrel, while international Brent crude hovers near $64 — both down roughly 15% so far this year amid abundant supply and sluggish demand.
Warren Patterson, the head of commodities strategy at ING, wrote in a Friday note that the lack of oil price impact indicates the market doesn't expect much lost supply.
While Russia has managed to reroute much of its crude through a ""shadow fleet,"" non-Western insurance, and non-dollar payment systems, buyers may still face growing compliance risks under the latest US sanctions.
""The impact is likely to fall more on pricing than availability, with Russia having to offer wider discounts to compensate buyers for higher legal and logistical risk,"" wrote Bridget Payne, the head of energy forecasting at Oxford Economics, in a late October report.
Payne said the added insurance and financing costs amount to a sanctions premium on Russian crude. That premium, she added, will widen its discount to international grades and eat into Moscow's net revenue.
Russia's economy grew 0.6% year-on-year in the third quarter, according to the Economic Development Ministry last week. The economy was down from 1.1% in the second quarter and 1.4% in the first quarter, a sharp slowdown after the wartime boom fueled by massive defense spending and government subsidies.
As President Vladimir Putin's administration faces mounting fiscal strain, Washington — still seeking a diplomatic breakthrough in Ukraine — has signaled it wants to keep energy prices low and inflation in check while tightening sanctions that could drain Moscow's war chest.
But President Donald Trump appears to be growing impatient with the lack of progress.
""Every time I speak to Vladimir, I have good conversations, and then they don't go anywhere,"" Trump said late last month.

What this means: On a weekly basis, Realtor.com reports the year-over-year change in active inventory, new listings and median prices.  On a monthly basis, they report total inventory.  For October, Realtor.com reported active inventory was up 15.3% YoY, but still down 13.2% compared to the 2017 to 2019 same month levels. 
Here is their weekly report: Weekly Housing Trends: Latest Data as of Nov. 1• Active inventory climbed 14.0% year over year

The number of homes active on the market climbed 14.0% year-over-year, marking the two full years (104 weeks) of annual gains in inventory. There were about 1.1 million homes for sale last week, marking the 27th week in a row over the million-listing threshold. Active inventory is growing significantly faster than new listings, an indication that more homes are sitting on the market for longer, and homeowners aren’t eager to sell.
  
• New listings—a measure of sellers putting homes up for sale—fell 3.2% year over year

New listings were down 3.2% last week compared with the same period a year ago, The decline marks a reversal after three weeks of consecutive growth, suggesting that seller momentum is starting to cool heading into November. 
  
• The median listing price was flat year-over-year

The median list price dipped slightly compared to the same week one year ago. Adjusting for home size, price per square foot fell 0.7% year-over-year, dropping for the ninth consecutive week. Price per square foot grew steadily for almost two years, but the weak sales activity has finally caught up and shaken underlying home values despite stable prices.

A Brazilian photographer and a woman he photographed in 2017 have ended up mired in an election fraud conspiracy in India, and it appears to all trace back to a stock photo site. 
As Hindustan Times reports, Rahul Gandhi, an opposition politician in India’s Haryana state, made explosive claims of election fraud this week relating to last year’s elections. Bizarrely, 22 of the alleged fraudulent votes cast last year in Indian elections were cast using an image shot in 2017 of a Brazilian woman, Larissa Nery. 
The man who took Nery’s portrait in 2017, Matheus Ferrero, has been overwhelmed by the news out of India, and has had to delete his online presence altogether because of all the attention, NDTV reports. Ferrero took the photos of Nery as practice, and with her permission, uploaded them online afterwards, including on various free stock photo sites. Ferrero has since removed the portrait from his Unsplash, which is not at all surprising. 
Gandhi, showing the portrait of Nery during a live-streamed press conference shown below, asked how it is possible that this woman voted in last year’s Indian elections 22 times. At the time, Nery’s identity was a mystery. 

There is no record that Nery herself, who is now a professional hairdresser in Brazil, traveled to India to illegally vote in the elections, and the photographer, Ferrero, is equally confused about how they ended up involved in this controversy. 
“They literally raided all my accounts. It was a lot of weird people talking about lot of things,” the photographer told Aos Fatos. 
As Gandhi alleges, Nery’s portrait was used as part of voter records in 10 different electoral sections, which he argues shows that it is a “centralized operation” of electron fraud. 
“Someone inserted this woman in the electoral list on a central level, not at the local level of the section,” Gandhi said while photos of Nery flashed on a screen behind him. Gandhi says that in total, his party, which opposes Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, identified 2.5 million votes that have indications of fraud. 

“They’re using an old picture of mine. It’s a really old photo. I was so young in it, like 18 or 20 years old. They’re using my photo for… I don’t know, some kind of election or voting thing in India. And they’re making me look Indian to scam people or hit each other with it. Look how crazy this is! What a mess I’m in!” Nery told NDTV. 

Amit Malviya, head of Modi’s information technology and social networks unit described the accusations as imaginative on X, formerly Twitter.  
“Now he claims that a Brazilian model voted 22 times in the Indian elections! From ‘vote theft’ to ‘vote carnival,’ Rahul Gandhi turned electoral mathematics into stand-up comedy.” 
In any event, there is no evidence whatsoever that Brazilian photographer Mattheus Ferrero or his 2017 portrait subject, Larissa Nery, had anything to do with alleged election fraud in India, but they have nonetheless been caught up in a whirlwind of chaos halfway across the globe. That is certainly not what someone expects to happen when they publish portraits on a stock photo site like Unsplash.

46,2025-11-07,"More than 16 air traffic control facilities are experiencing shortages Friday.
Officials at the Federal Aviation Administration decided to gradually increase air travel reductions to 10% after the agency's safety team determined it would be the best approach, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told reporters at Reagan National Airport.
It is possible the Department of Transportation may ask airlines to cancel more than 10% of their flights if controllers keep calling out in higher numbers, Duffy told ABC News.
There is an average four hour delay at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Virginia, a 90-minute delay at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport in Arizona and roughly an hour delay at major airports in Chicago, Houston and Austin.
Major airlines said would cancel hundreds of flights on Friday -- out of thousands of daily flights -- as the FAA is set to begin limiting flight capacity at 40 major U.S. airports amid the government shutdown.
Despite nearly 1,000 flights being cancelled on Friday, there are still major delays at airports across the country due to staffing issues in air traffic controller towers and centers.
If the government shutdown continues, more air travel reductions could be on the way, Duffy said in an interview on ABC News Live.
""My hope is that this government shutdown will end soon and we can get back in the business of letting Americans travel,"" Duffy said in the interview.
More than 16 air traffic control facilities across the country are seeing shortages on Friday. Some of these facilities cover airspace in multiple states.
Pilots have reported that air traffic controllers are slower to respond, not using proper terminology and there have been more incidents of planes getting too close together, Duffy warned.
Duffy does say he doesn’t think people should cancel or not book flights for Thanksgiving.
""I want it to be fixed, but also I have to continue to look at data and if this continues, and I have more [air traffic] controllers who decide they can't come to work and control the airspace, but instead have to take a second job, with that you might see 10% would have been a good number, because we might go to 15% or 20%,"" Duffy said during an interview earlier at a Breitbart News event in Washington, D.C.
This could likely cost airlines tens of millions of dollars, Duffy said.
The initial plan called for a 10% reduction starting Friday, but officials chose to gradually increase the reductions for safety, Duffy said.
Loss of separation -- the minimum distance kept between aircrafts to keep them safe -- in the airspace and complaints from pilots about stress from air traffic controllers are among the data points that led to the decision to reduce air travel, Duffy said.
""We've seen more breaches in regard to that loss of separation, we see more incursions on tarmac throughout the country, and we have more complaints from pilots about stress from air traffic controllers, and more complaints about the lack of responsiveness from controllers,"" Duffy said.
""That data is going in the wrong direction, not in the right direction, which made us make the decision we have to actually take additional measures to reduce the pressure in our system,"" Duffy said.
Duffy said the FAA has asked private jets to avoid flying at the 40 airports impacted by the flight reductions, though they are currently not prohibited from flying there. He said private jet companies have been cooperative and are choosing alternate airports to help alleviate the pressure at those airports.
As of 4:10 p.m. ET on Friday, at least 966 flights within, into or out of the United States have been cancelled so far, per FlightAware.
American Airlines said Thursday it will cancel about 220 of its roughly 6,000 departures starting Friday and lasting through this weekend.
United Airlines said in a statement it plans to cancel less than 200 of its more than 5,000 flights each day through the weekend. The airline has listed the flight cancellations on a special website along with other information for travelers.
A company spokesperson told ABC News that about half of customers who had their flights canceled were able to be rebooked within 4 hours of their original departure time.
Delta Airlines said it planned to cancel about 170 daily flights. 
American, United and Delta -- the three largest airlines in the U.S. -- all have said they believe they will be able to accommodate most of the impacted passengers on other flights.
The cancellations are the latest -- and perhaps biggest -- disruption to air travel since the government shutdown began more than a month ago. 
The FAA decided not to cut any international flights as it would be a violation of international agreements with the countries, according to Duffy.
“We have international agreements that we abide by, and because of those international agreements, I'm not going to impact those international flights. And because if I do, what will happen is we have other countries that are waiting to have a breach of those contracts from the US so they can cut down American flights, and then that would have a very long lasting impact on our ability to to to send travelers from the U.S. to those partners that have the agreements,"" Duffy said.
Duffy said he has spoken to President Donald Trump about the flight reduction decision and that the White House is “fully read in” on it. 
“The White House also looks to the safety team to help us make the right decisions to do the best we can to keep people safe. But there's an easy answer. There's an easy answer, open up the government, stop this,"" Duffy said.
Travelers began to be notified of the canceled flights on Thursday.
Caitlin Ladner, in Wisconsin, said she had planned to fly to Raleigh, North Carolina, on a Friday for a trip to surprise her parents with her sister but got a notice about her canceled flight on the United app.
""We've been planning it for a while .... It's pretty upsetting,"" she told ABC News.
Despite an offer to reschedule her flight, she said she decided to cancel it altogether.
""I don't know when all this is going to end,"" she said.
Meanwhile, other travelers across the country on Thursday were bracing for delays -- and trying to make it home before the cancellations started. 
At Reagan National Airport, just outside Washington, D.C., Frederick Ross, from Fort Myers, Florida, told ABC News the current travel headaches have him rethinking his upcoming holiday travel plans.
""It’s a big factor to have to possibly deal with delays and cancellations, and talking about traveling with the whole family, it’s easier to just take a road trip,"" he said.
The FAA said earlier this week it was reducing flight capacity at 40 major airports across the country to alleviate staffing pressures. The reductions this weekend are starting out at 4% but will eventually climb to 10%, federal officials said.
Under an emergency order issued by the FAA on Thursday, airlines are required to reduce operations at the 40 ""high-impact airports"" by 6% by Nov. 11 and by 10% by Nov. 14. Any airline that does not comply will be fined $75,000 per flight over the limit, according to the FAA order.
That announcement came after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said earlier that the FAA would be forced to shut down the airspace in some areas if the shutdown continues into next week, warning of ""mass chaos.""
Staffing shortages among air traffic controllers has been an ongoing concern and there have been scattered flight delays and cancellations over the past several weeks, as the shutdown has stretched on. 
Last weekend, a surge in callouts among air traffic controllers led to strained staffing at multiple airports across the U.S.  -- including in the New York City area where 80% of controllers were absent at one point, the FAA reported. 
Air traffic controllers, who are required to work without pay for the duration of the shutdown, are credited with helping end the most recent shutdown in 2019, when a series of absences delayed flights and heightened pressure on members of Congress.
The precise impact the flight cancellations will have on overall air travel is unclear.
""We're not in the peak of summer, we're not over a holiday period. So we feel confident that we have enough seats in these markets to accommodate all travelers,"" United's chief customer officer, David Kinzelman, told ABC News.
""There will not be chaos over the weekend,"" he said, likening the impact of the reductions to a ""medium-sized storm.""
He added, ""We are going to cancel flights that we think have the least amount of disruption for customers. If you're in a market with only two small regional flights and you cancel one or both of them, that's a huge impact to that market. We want to avoid that. And so what we're doing is really spreading it around the system.""

    The numbers are clear. Even without a federal rebate, owning an electric car costs less over its lifetime than owning a gas-powered vehicle.
  
The federal government's $7,500 discount on electric vehicles has officially ended, which significantly changes the math of EV ownership -- and might make you wonder if it's more economical to buy a gas-powered car now.
This is a fair question, but the sticker price of a car (and the lack of a government rebate) is only one piece of the total cost of vehicle ownership, which also includes fuel costs, maintenance and depreciation.
When you take that all into account, EVs are still usually cheaper to own in the long run, according to auto experts. We did the math to show you how the costs break down, and how you can make an accurate comparison before making your next car purchase.
The sticker price is what most people think about when they compare the prices of different cars. From that perspective, the disappearance of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit puts EVs at a significant disadvantage on upfront costs when compared to gasoline or passive-hybrid cars.
When it comes to upfront costs, we've mapped out the winner, loser and runner-up.
Winner 🏆
Internal combustion engine vehicles
Traditional gasoline cars usually have the lowest sticker price compared to their electrified counterparts. These types of vehicles have long-established supply chains and economies of scale that make them cheaper to manufacture, according to Antuan Goodwin, CNET's EV senior writer.
Runner-up 🥈
Hybrid vehicles
Hybrid-electric vehicles often have a slight premium over pure gas cars due to the dual gas and electric powertrain, but are usually still more affordable than most pure EVs.
Loser 💸
Electric vehicles
Electric cars are typically at the top end for sticker price. ""The battery is going to be the biggest reason that EVs are more expensive,"" Goodwin says. EVs also don't benefit as much from economies of scale. Plus, consumers are still subsidizing the research and development that legacy automakers are doing to design electric cars, according to Amelia Dalgaard, an automotive expert known online as Motorhead Mama.
You can't control gas prices, but you can control how much you spend to fuel up.
This is where you start to see some of the biggest savings between EVs and gasoline-powered vehicles. Here's how the costs shake out:
Winner 🏆
Electric vehicles
The cost of charging an EV depends a lot on your local electricity rates, and on where you charge your vehicle. Charging at home with a Level 2 charger is usually the cheapest way to fuel your EV, while public Level 3 fast-chargers are usually the most expensive. Generally speaking, charging an EV at home is cheaper than fueling a comparable car with gasoline, according to Goodwin and Dalgaard. For that average 11,000 miles per year, at the national average electricity rate, you'd spend $550 on charging.
Runner-up 🥈
Hybrid vehicles
The fuel costs for passive hybrids are usually lower than regular gas cars because they get better overall gas mileage. Some models, like the Toyota Prius, get an average 54 miles per gallon. So while their upfront cost might be higher than a pure gasoline car, hybrids have a much lower cost per mile, and therefore lower refueling costs.
Loser 💸
Internal combustion engine vehicles
Gasoline is usually the more expensive way to fuel a car when compared to an electric battery. ""Electricity has historically been less expensive than gasoline by a significant chunk,"" Goodwin says. The average gasoline car gets 26 miles per gallon, which accounts to a $1,320 annual fuel cost for the average 11,000 miles driven per year.
EVs are also a big winner for lower maintenance costs, which adds a nice bit of savings to their total cost of ownership. Here's how they compare to gasoline cars:
Winner 🏆
Electric vehicles
Whereas gas engines have plenty of things that can break, electric powertrains hardly ever do. ""Typically, it's set it and forget it,"" Goodwin says. (No oil changes, spark plugs or exhaust system here.) That makes EV maintenance costs a lot lower than their gas counterparts. That being said, tires on EVs generally wear faster because the vehicle is heavier. And if you do need to make a significant repair on an EV (say, after a collision), it's generally more expensive because the batteries and technology in an EV are costly to replace.
Runner-up 🥈
Internal combustion engine vehicles
Gasoline cars require a lot more maintenance than electric cars. That's because gasoline engines have a lot more moving parts, and a lot more things that can break, compared to an electric powertrain. Regular oil and fluid changes, plus replacements of brakes and other mechanical parts, can add up to a lot of frequent maintenance costs.
Loser 💸
Hybrid vehicles
Passive hybrid vehicles require basically all of the same maintenance that pure gasoline vehicles do, but maybe less often because the engine runs less of the time. Meanwhile, plug-in hybrids, which have both a full gasoline engine and a hefty electric battery powertrain, are basically the worst of both worlds when it comes to maintenance costs, Dalgaard says.
Insurance is yet another ongoing cost that you just can't avoid -- but different types of cars can mean your policy prices vary wildly.
Insurance costs vary a lot depending on the type of car you own. Here are the general trends for different vehicles:
Winner 🏆
Internal combustion engine vehicles
These usually have the lowest insurance costs, because they're cheaper to replace and repair after collisions.
Runner-up 🥈
Hybrid vehicles
Generally, these cars are more expensive to insure compared to pure gasoline vehicles because they're more expensive to begin with.
Loser 💸
Electric vehicles
These cars are the most expensive to insure because they have the highest sticker price, and because components such as batteries are more expensive to replace, according to Goodwin and Dalgaard.
Depreciation -- or how much your vehicle decreases in value over time -- can have a huge impact on your total cost of ownership. That's because when you go to sell your car, its residual value can make a big difference in how much money you lose in the transaction. 
Here's the breakdown between gasoline and electric cars:
Winner 🏆
Internal combustion engine vehicles
Because gasoline cars have been around for so long, their resale value follows a predictable and well-established depreciation curve. Currently, that usually means gas cars depreciate more slowly than electric cars.
Runner-up 🥈
Hybrid vehicles
These cars have traditionally held their value well due to strong demand and fuel efficiency.
Loser 💸
Electric vehicles
Historically, EVs have experienced higher and faster depreciation than gas vehicles. That's partly because the EV technology improves so quickly (leading to better battery range and faster charging) that older models become undesirable more rapidly (very much like the old iPhone models, Dalgaard says). That said, as the EV market matures, this effect might begin to lessen, Goodwin observes, leading to better resale value for EVs.
I compared the total cost of ownership for the same car in its electric and gas-powered models to highlight the differences.
I did the math with a real example, comparing an electric and gasoline-powered version of the same car: the new 2026 release of the Chevrolet Equinox.

Winner: Electric vehicles 🏆
Loser: Internal combustion engine vehicles 💸
Even without the federal government's $7,500 tax credit, EVs can still have a lower total cost of ownership than internal-combustion engine cars.
""In general, you're going to be better off with an EV,"" Dalgaard says. That's because even though EVs have a higher upfront cost, gasoline cars can have more than double the fuel costs, and significantly higher maintenance costs.
Hybrids, meanwhile, probably have an advantage over ICE vehicles (due to the improved gas mileage), and offer a good middle ground if you're not ready for an EV.
The best choice for you is also going to depend on your driving habits: How much you drive, how long you plan to keep the car and whether you can charge an EV at home, for example.
""Now you have more of an ability to pick a powertrain that works for you,"" Goodwin says of the current vehicle market.
You should run the numbers yourself using local electricity rates, gas prices and driving patterns. It's complicated, but online calculators like this one from the New York Times can help you make the comparison.

November is here, which means we're likely just a few months away from the release of the Galaxy S26 series. Samsung is expected to unveil its newest flagship lineup during an Unpacked announcement event in Q1 2026, and if the latest leaks and rumors are correct, we'll finally get our hands on the phones sometime in March. That's significantly later than Samsung's usual release timeline, but if it means that the S26 will get more time in the oven, then I'm all for it.
While we wait for the Galaxy S26 to drop, many folks are wondering what the release will mean for the Samsung Galaxy S25 lineup. Will the best-selling Android phones get a permanent price drop or will they simply disappear from shelves? Should you wait for the Galaxy S26 lineup or buy a S25 during this month's Black Friday sales? Let's break it all down.
According to the latest rumors, the next Galaxy Unpacked event will be held on February 25th in San Francisco, California. This means that, since new Samsung phones usually hit store shelves about two weeks after their unveiling, we can expect that the Galaxy S26 series will finally be available for purchase around March 12th or 13th.
Along with the Galaxy S26 Plus and S26 Ultra, the base model Galaxy S26 (which might be renamed the Galaxy S26 Pro), is expected to come equipped with a custom Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chipset, some meaningful camera upgrades, and all of the latest AI software tricks.
 



We don't know a lot about the flagship phones yet, so comparing the Galaxy S26 vs Galaxy S25 is a bit tricky, but suffice to say that the S26 devices are expected to be slimmer, faster, and more feature-packed than their predecessors. They're also expected to be a bit more expensive, starting around $899 for the base model and going up to around $1,400 for the S26 Ultra.
Will the improvements justify the price hike? It's tough to say, but it wouldn't be unreasonable for someone to buy the tried-and-tested Samsung Galaxy S25 instead of the newer model, especially if you can get a good price. Speaking of which..
 



So will the Samsung Galaxy S25 get a price drop when the S26 arrives? Not exactly.
Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android
Although it does happen on occasion, it's pretty unusual for flagship phones to get a permanent price decrease when they reach last-gen status. It's more likely that they'll get discounted once their successors are released, but it's just as possible that the S25 will simply run out of stock once the S26 arrives. Think about it this way: how often do you see a discounted Galaxy S24 that isn't refurbished? Sure, it happens (the Google Pixel 9 is 38% off today, for instance), but it's not as common as you might think.
On the bright side, price tracking data indicates that devices tend to get the cheapest right before the next generation arrives. And with Black Friday sales just around the corner, you can fully expect the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25 Ultra to receive some record-smashing discounts in the coming weeks. For a little context, the base model Samsung Galaxy S25 dropped to $699.99 during last month's October Prime Day sale event. With the arrival of the S26 series swiftly approaching, I'd expect Black Friday to knock the phone to the same price or even lower.
In conclusion, if you want to buy a Samsung Galaxy S25 now that the S26 is approaching, I wouldn't wait for the new phones to drop - Black Friday 2025 might be the answer.
 




The flagship sails on
Although its soon to be supplanted by a newer model, the Galaxy S25 continues to be an outstanding flagship phone, packing premium Snapdragon hardware and AI smarts into a sleek, compact frame. 
 




The best of Android (for now)
The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is the base model S25's souped up big sibling, coming complete with a gorgeous 6.9-inch AMOLED display, incredible cameras, and a built-in stylus pen. Just like the base model S25, the upcoming Black Friday sales are expected to knock the S25 Ultra down to its lowest price ever.

51,2025-11-07,"The best Garmin deals around Black Friday are usually on years-old models like the Fenix 7X or Epix Pro. Should you still buy them?

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Garmin watches have a well-earned reputation for longevity. So when you see how expensive new Garmin watches are getting, a years-old Garmin at a steep discount will look mighty tempting. Since Garmin likes to clear out old stock during Black Friday, it's worth deciding now whether a last-gen Garmin watch is right for you, or if newer is better.
I've covered Garmin watch deals for years, and I always have to weigh whether I should recommend deals on models like the Forerunner 55 or 745 that are years out of date and have noticeable flaws, but let you buy into the Garmin ecosystem for $150 instead of $500.
Then you have Garmin's old flagships. Right now, you can get a Fenix 7X Sapphire Solar for $599 ($300 off) or 7X Pro Sapphire Solar for $659 ($340 off). You're spending half as much as a $1,300 Fenix 8 Pro, with flagship-level specs and battery life. But if you're planning to make your watch last for years, can you live without the quality-of-life improvements Garmin has introduced recently?
With up to 37 days or 122 GPS hours with solar, a built-in flashlight, dual-band GPS, offline maps with ClimbPro, a titanium bezel around a 1.4-inch touch display, and daily suggested running or cycling, the Fenix 7X gives you the best that Garmin has to offer — right up until the last year or so of new features. 
Garmin's most recent generation has focused on what I'd call ""mainstream"" upgrades. The Fenix 8 added an AMOLED display, ECG and skin temperature data, and a mic & speaker for calls and commands. Those same features trickled down to cheaper Garmin models, along with the flashlight. Eventually, I'd bet that the Fenix 8 Pro's LTE-M and satellite tools will come to more watches, too.
The question becomes, do you need these? I don't use many of these new features especially often, but I strongly prefer AMOLED to MIP and would have trouble going back. For anyone tempted by smartwatches, you might prefer a much cheaper Vivoactive or Venu to a bulky Fenix 7X that hasn't modernized.
For people who use their old Garmin watch for basic workout tracking and glancing at notifications, though, splurging on a last-gen Fenix deal is smarter, because you're only paying for the fitness perks you'll care about, not the bells and whistles.
 



We also have to discuss Garmin's software gatekeeping. Even if Garmin watch hardware has a reputation for lasting years, they do so as closed-circuit artifacts of their time. At a certain point, Garmin locks off the OS and refuses to add any new features that might disrupt the delicate equilibrium.
Unfortunately, that tends to happen within 1–2 years, even for Garmin's Fenix flagships. There was plenty of controversy when Garmin stopped giving the Fenix 7 series new features after the Fenix 8 launch; now, anyone buying the Fenix 7X today won't get running economy, evening reports, Strength or Triathlon Coaching, a rucking mode, or other new features that've impressed me over the last year.
But that can't be helped! Garmin's strategy is to weaponize FOMO so that you feel tempted to buy the newest model. Then you feel entitled to cutting-edge features, and when they run out, you upgrade again. I guarantee Fenix 8 owners will be complaining about this in 2026, after the Fenix 9 launches.
Maybe buying an older model that's already cut off from feature updates is a good way to make sure you don't pay attention to shiny new Garmin toys, and remain happy with what you have for longer.
 



Today's best Garmin watches are more expensive than ever. Mid-range models like the $550 Venu 4 and Forerunner 570 are impressive, but why buy either of them when you can get an Epix Pro (Gen 2) for $499 ($250 off)? It's a question of whether last year's best features (like offline maps) or 2025's newest upgrades (like doubled AMOLED brightness) are more important to you.
It's an entirely different discussion if you're looking at lower-end Garmin watches. The Venu Sq 2 is frequently one of the cheapest models available during deal events, but it's quite limited in several ways. I'd much rather spend slightly more on a new cheap Garmin like the Vivoactive 6 (currently $50 off on Best Buy) than buy a model that will feel obsolete out of the box.
Otherwise, if you're really tempted by some of the best new Garmin watches, you'll have to be patient. Based on Garmin's typical deals timeline, we probably won't see a Fenix 8 or Forerunner 970 for $300 off until 2027 or 2028.

52,2025-11-07,"It’s been a whole year since BMW teased the prototype of its F 450 GS. At this year’s EICMA, the much-anticipated mini-GS finally made its global debut, and drew plenty of oohs and aahs.
First things first: it retains almost all of the design cues we saw on last year’s prototype. It’s based on the current GS design language, featuring trademark elements like the LED headlight with ""X"" DRL and the unique flyline.
The bike is going to be produced by India’s TVS Motor, the same bikemaker who worked on the brand’s G 310 bikes. That starts with the engine itself – an all-new 420cc parallel-twin motor producing 48 horsepower at 8,750 rpm and peak torque of 32 lb-ft (44 Nm) at 6,750 rpm.
That’s more power than the likes of the Royal Enfield Himalayan 450, which makes 40 hp at 8,000 rpm and peak torque of 30 lb-ft (40.6 Nm) at 5,500 rpm, and the CFMoto Ibex 450, which produces 44 hp at 8,500 rpm and 32.5 lb-ft (44 Nm) of torque at 6,250 rpm.
That’s impressive when you consider that the F 450 GS weighs 393 lb (178 kg), compared to the Himalayan 450’s 432-lb (196-kg), and the Ibex 450’s ~430-lb (195-kg) wet weight. More power-to-weight should directly affect the way the motorcycle feels and rides, regardless of whether you’re on trails pulling that throttle or riding at highway speeds.
That low weight is in part thanks to the tubular steel trellis frame, which is a departure from how BMW has been producing its frames recently. The likes of the bigger R-series and F 800 and F 900 models all employ pressed and welded steel frames – but then again, maybe TVS had more to do with this than BMW.
The F 450 GS rides on a 57.7-inch (1,465.5-mm) wheelbase, with a 19-inch wheel in the front and a 17-inch at the rear. The standard seat height is 33.3 inches (838 mm), while you can also opt for one that’s a tad bit lower at around 32.7 inches (830.5 mm) and one that’s a little bit taller at around 34 inches (863.6 mm). You get a 3.6-gallon (13.6-liter) tank that offers a range of over 200 miles (322 km).
Suspension duties are taken care of by 43-mm adjustable KYB upside-down forks at the front and a KYB monoshock with adjustable preload and compression damping at the back. You get 7.1 inches (180.3 mm) of travel at each end. The braking department sees a four-pot Brembo front caliper on a single 310-mm disc in the front and a ByBre rear caliper on a 240-mm rotor in the back. Both ends come with cornering ABS Pro as standard.
One standout feature is BMW’s new Easy Ride Clutch (ERC), which comes stock on the top-of-the-line GS Trophy trim, the only version slated for the US market. It is similar to Honda’s latest E-Clutch, combined with BMW Gear Shift Assist Pro to eliminate the need for manual clutch lever movement. Unlike Honda’s system, which uses electronics to control clutch engagement, BMW’s ERC uses a centrifugal clutch that disengages automatically when revs fall to idle.
You also get three riding modes – Rain, Road, and Enduro – plus other rider aids like ABS Pro, Dynamic Brake Control, Dynamic Traction Control, and engine drag torque control. The bike also gets all-LED lighting, a USB-C port right in the cockpit, and a 6.5-inch TFT screen for monitoring navigation and riding data, including lean angle.
Other features limited to the US-bound GS Trophy version include blue-and-white paintwork, handguards, adjustable sports suspension, a white-painted frame, and an aluminum engine guard. The bike also gets heated grips, adjustable hand levers, with additional adjustability on the gear changer and rear brake pedal.
BMW is set to offer four different trim options: a Basic trim; an Exclusive trim that would come with off-road foot pegs, hand guards, engine guard, Riding Modes Pro, Shift Assistant Pro , and a clear windshield; Sport trim, which would come with a sport suspension, in addition to everything in the Exclusive trim; and the top-of-the-line GS Trophy trim that includes everything mentioned previously, plus an aluminum engine guard and the Easy Ride Clutch.
Still, BMW’s launch left some questions unanswered. There are no real-world images yet – only AI-generated visuals – and no confirmed pricing or US release date. Rumors suggest American riders may have to wait until 2027, while European sales are set for spring 2026. In the UK, the Trophy edition starts at £7,760 (about US$10,100).
This is an important launch for BMW. The lightweight, sub-500cc adventure bike segment is booming, and there’s no doubt that BMW wants a piece of that pie. However, competition is fierce, with the newly-released Kawasaki KLE 500, Honda NX500, CFMoto Ibex 450, KTM 390 Adventure, and Royal Enfield Himalayan 450 all vying for attention. Sure, BMW’s badge appeal might give it an edge, but whether that prestige translates to its smallest adventure offering remains to be seen.

There’s a tablet for every kind of budget: from the super affordable $100 models to the ultra-premium ones that cost well in excess of $1,000. But if you are not after flashy branding and more concerned about what is under the hood, a solid Android tablet can go a long way-especially when it delivers strong hardware without the luxury price tag. Thatâs exactly what this 10-inch 128GB WiFi Android tablet manages to do: Right now, itâs hitting an all-time low of $71 on Amazon, down from $129, to become the most aggressively priced Android tablet on the market this Black Friday
See at Amazon
And at this budget, too, this tablet does not shy away from power. Running Android 15, it has a 2.0GHz octa-core processor that keeps things fluid through multitasking, light gaming and streaming. Apps load fast, daily scrolling feels responsive, and you will not experience the bloat or random ads that often slow down cheap devices. Moreover, Android 15 gives you tighter privacy controls and smoother system navigation which most of the older or brand-free tablets lack.
What’s more, you get 128GB of internal storage on the tablet and it is expandable up to 1TB via microSD. More impressively, it features 24GB of RAM thanks to virtual memory support atop 4+20GB which gives it enough flexibility to keep multiple apps open without lag or reloads.
The 10.1-inch display seals the deal for everyday content use: It is an HD IPS panel with a resolution of 1280×800, showing bright, accurate colors and wide viewing angles â perfect for watching shows, reading, or online classes. The presence of built-in blue light reduction tech also makes long hours less tiring for your eyes, with an anti-flicker design for smooth visuals. Add in the 8MP rear camera and 5MP front camera and youâve got a setup fit for clear video calls and virtual meetings.
Another nice surprise is the battery life: Thanks to an efficient chip and large-capacity battery, you can get approximately 8 hours of active use, or up to 3 days on standby. Itâs enough time for movie binges, study sessions, or travel entertainment. Moreover, the battery can be filled up in about 90 minutes because of the implemented fast charging with a Type-C port included. And for even more convenience, Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.0 ensure faster and more stable internet.
You could almost forget, given what you get here for less than $75, that this isn’t a device coming from one of the big brands. Thatâs officially the cheapest 10-inch Android 15 tablet with these specs seen yet, and deals like this rarely stick around for long.

54,2025-11-07,"AI is certainly eating up all the memory, but is it bad enough to cancel an NVIDIA SUPER refresh and drive current GPU prices through the roof?

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

NVIDIA's RTX 50-series graphics cards got off to a slow start when they launched in 2025, experiencing supply shortages, spiking prices, and general disbelief in the massive advancements afforded by DLSS 4 and the Multi Frame Generation feature exclusive to the new Blackwell architecture.
While a lot of PC gamers have now been able to get their hands on one of NVIDIA's latest consumer GPUs — prices have been dropping consistently over time to the point where you can sometimes find them for less than MSRP — others have been waiting for a mid-generation RTX 50-series refresh to spend their money.
I'm talking about the SUPER lineup, an upgrade that NVIDIA usually releases about a year after the standard cards are released.
Although NVIDIA hasn't ever officially mentioned a SUPER refresh for its Blackwell GPUs, many have been holding onto their money in the hopes that the new cards will be announced soon.
Those plans might have just been dashed, although this rumor has a good chance of turning out to be false.
[rumor]due to the crazy shortage recently, 3gb gddr7 cant make it to the consumer market for desktop, thus the super series is cancelled.and the current models are expected to be more expensive very soon, because of the increasing cost of 2gb gddr7. pic.twitter.com/yMSMj1MjqJNovember 7, 2025
According to a post from the UNIKO's Hardware X account (via Videocardz), the SUPER refresh is cancelled ""due to the crazy shortage"" of 3GB GDDR7 memory modules.
There is indeed a severe shortage of both NAND and DRAM due to the global AI demand. All of those specialized AI GPUs and their data center support system require the same stuff that goes into our beloved consumer GPUs, creating a bottleneck in the supply chain.
All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.
Whether or not that bottleneck is serious enough to halt an entire mid-generation refresh from the foremost GPU supplier in the world remains to be seen. It's a rumor at best, but it's still causing some panic.
One of the big reasons that many people have been waiting on NVIDIA's RTX 50 SUPER lineup has to do with VRAM, or a lack thereof in the non-SUPER cards.
Because NVIDIA chose to use 2GB GDDR7 modules in the RTX 50-series (except for the desktop RTX 5050 that uses GDDR6), VRAM amounts are considered underwhelming by many.
The RTX 5060, for example, has just 8GB of VRAM, which simply isn't enough in 2025 to handle the massive demands from many modern titles. A move to 3GB GDDR7 modules would, of course, allow NVIDIA to pack more VRAM into its SUPER GPUs.
UNIKO surmises that the DRAM stock is ""probably reserved"" for both RTX 5090 Laptop and RTX Pro 6000 cards, which make a lot more money than the mid-range GPU lineup. The Pro 6000, for example, is currently discounted by $650 at Newegg, bringing the total down to ... $8,345.99.
 



Tacked onto the UNIKO's Hardware post is a warning that current models are also about to get a lot more expensive due to rising costs of 2GB GDDR7 modules.
The global AI buildout really can't get enough memory, and because the business is so much more lucrative than the consumer GPU market, it's not a far stretch to think that NVIDIA would rather put any memory it can get its hands on into AI infrastructure.
Although I can't say for sure whether or not the memory shortage will get bad enough to drive up prices on current NVIDIA GPUs, it's currently not the worst time to consider investing in new hardware.
I purchased the RTX 5070 Ti above MSRP earlier this year, and I haven't regretted my decision. All it took was some testing of Multi Frame Generation in DOOM: The Dark Ages to convince me that the card is the real deal.
Now that many models have returned to MSRP, and with Black Friday/Cyber Monday headed our way in a few short weeks, this might be one of the last chances to get a Blackwell card at a reasonable price.


NVIDIA's SUPER cards are designed to offer superior performance across the board, and with the prospect of more VRAM (an especially touchy subject for the 8GB RTX 5060), they're definitely worth waiting for. That is, if they're ever coming at all.
It's hard to say as we're working with rumors, but it is true that the AI buildout is gobbling up memory like never before. Considering how much more money stands to be made from AI and from NVIDIA's high-end GPUs, it's not hard to see why the supply of RAM for the more affordable consumer cards could dry up.
Yes, as it stands now, you can find several of NVIDIA's RTX 50-series GPUs for less than MSRP. I've included two MSI options above available at Newegg that are on sale with Black Friday price protection enabled.
Some years, the Black Friday GPU deals are lacking. Other years, they're too good to pass up. Your guess is as good as mine, but considering Black Friday is only three weeks away (it officially lands on November 28) and the discounts have already begun at various retailers, it can't hurt to take a look at what's available.

Mark Mobius has a warning for AI investors — and one suggestion for where they could put their money instead.
The legendary fund manager and founder of Mobius Capital Partners said he foresaw a big correction coming for top names in the AI space as valuations soar. A correction could tank the top AI stocks by as much as 40%, he said in an interview with Bloomberg Television published Friday.
""When I look at a correction, I look at 30%, down 30%, 40%,"" Mobius speculated, though he said he believed in the long-term uptrend for the AI. ""That will happen, but it will be short-lived.""
Talk of a stock market correction has grown this week amid a sell-off in the tech sector. 
Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon speculated that the market could drop as much as 20% over the next couple of years. Morgan Stanley's CEO, Ted Pick, said as much as 15% drawdown was possible, adding that pullbacks were healthy for the overall market.
Mobius said he was mainly concerned about high valuations and heavy spending in the AI space. AI investment at some firms is ""probably excessive,"" Mobius added, referring to the billions mega-cap tech firms have earmarked for capex this year.
Investors, like Mobius, have been fretting that some AI companies are valued too highly, especially when monetization plans are unclear.
""We've got to be prepared for a pullback. And you buy the dip,"" Mobius said. ""I'd love to see a pullback of 30%, 40%. I would be in there with both arms and legs. We'd be buying a lot.""
In the meantime, there's one area of the market Mobius thinks could be a promising buy for investors: emerging market stocks.
Emerging markets have outperformed the US market so far this year, Mobius said.
The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF is up 29.7% year-to-date, outpacing the S&P 500's 13.8% gain. 
The index is largely up due to strength in Chinese and Indian stocks, Mobius said. China's economy is ""moving up"" the technology ladder, and India is also developing in the computer hardware space — two things that could help fuel a rotation back to EM assets, he suggested.
He also pointed to tailwinds like the Fed cutting rates, which lowers the value of the US dollar relative to other currencies and can give foreign firms more buying power.
""These two powerhouses will really make emerging markets look very good. Of course, that will swash over into other emerging markets,"" he added.

Points for creativity: Netflix partnered with mental wellness app Calm to create an immersive audio experience inspired by its Oscar-aspiring “Train Dreams.” The collaboration, launching today, represents Netflix’s first venture on the Calm platform and a potential blueprint for how specialty films can cut through the noise by targeting audiences when they’re asleep.
The 20-minute “Sleep Story x Soundscape” hybrid transforms Clint Bentley’s drama into a meditative audio journey, featuring narrator Will Patton alongside the film’s original score and sound design. Adapted from Denis Johnson’s Pulitzer-nominated novella about a railroad laborer in the early 20th century American West, “Train Dreams” explores themes of solitude, loss, and resilience — the kind of contemplative territory where Calm’s 100 million users already spend their time.

The Calm team worked with the film’s sound designer, Lee Salevan, and composer Bryce Dessner, utilizing the film’s sound stems and score cues overlaid with sections of dialogue from Bentley and Greg Kwedar’s script. 

 









The odds are stacked against independent and specialty films capturing audience attention. However, this may represent a new kind of counterprogramming: Rather than shout louder, this collaboration markets while you sleep. 
Calm previously collaborated with superhero franchises like “Venom: The Last Dance” (voiced by Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock and Venom), but this is the first film partnership to create one of its Sleep Stories.
Calm has also previously created Sleep Stories from public-domain classics like “Pride and Prejudice” and “The Wizard of Oz,” and enlisted talent like Walton Goggins and Lin-Manuel Miranda to narrate original Sleep Stories like “The Yard Sale” and “Adventures in Puerto Rico.”
The film stars Joel Edgerton, Felicity Jones, and William H. Macy, with Patton’s narration carrying over to the Calm experience. The distribution strategy extends beyond Calm’s app, with Netflix sharing the soundscape across YouTube, Instagram, and X.

The YouTube TV, Disney content battle continues, and a new report sheds light on how consumers might be feeling as a direct result.
A survey conducted by Drive Research was highlighted by Variety this week, which claims that upwards of 82% of YouTube TV subscribers are fed up and want out if the battle with Disney continues. Now, while this number seems high, the post notes that Drive Research is a market research firm that polled 1,100 U.S. consumers with a YouTube TV subscription.
This 82% are ""likely"" to cancel; however, 24% of those surveyed claim that they have ""already cancelled"" or are at least ""planning to"" at some point.
The fact of the matter is, as noted in the firm's research, people have subscribed to YouTube TV to obtain the content they want to see (channels from Disney). Over half state they did so to view sports on ESPN, like the NFL. Nearly half claim that they've purchased a YouTube TV subscription because ""they value the ability to share the service with household members or use multiple streams,"" per Variety.
YouTube TV reportedly chimed in, as Variety notes, a spokesperson offered comment about Drive Research's survey. YouTube TV throws shade, stating, ""We’re not familiar with this firm and can’t speak to their credibility or methodology."" The spokesperson adds that while it doesn't love ""subscriber churn,"" what's been happening recently has been ""manageable"" and ""does not align with the findings of this survey.""
Advancing the narrative, roughly 30% of Drive Research's findings state that people are already looking to directly subscribe to ESPN Unlimited and Hulu Plus Live TV just to get what they're missing.
 



There is probably a wealth of emotions and takes that can arise from a situation like this, especially from the consumers, but the fact of the matter is that we're stuck in a deadlock. Neither YouTube TV nor Disney has been willing to budge on settling this content battle and restoring content for the consumer. Each side's been pointing fingers at the other, as YouTube TV claims Disney's been ""unnecessarily aggressive and assertive,"" while the other says the opposite's blown things out of proportion.

There was a report earlier this week, right before Election Day, that said Disney approached YouTube TV to restore ABC for one day, just for that crucial moment. However, YouTube TV reportedly declined, instead wanting Disney to allow it to return ABC and ESPN ""indefinitely"" while their talks proceed.
This report from Drive Research on consumer frustration echoes another that says viewers are irritated by the struggle, which hurts them more than anyone else. Not only have events users wait all week for (College Football, NFL, Election Day, weekly shows) come and gone, but users are also left with uncertainty as to how best to proceed. Users on Reddit have started venting about this issue, as they're going to miss out.
Others have stepped up to offer consumers a way out of the blackout, like Hulu and DirecTV. The latter highlights its Genre Packs, which place everything consumers would want (sports, TV, and more) front and center and available.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with 26-year-old David Kobrosky, the founder of Intros AI, from Brooklyn. The following has been edited for length and clarity.
When I went to college in 2017, I already knew I wanted to work in startups and make a difference in the world.
After my freshman year at the University of Michigan, I switched majors from business to computer science, which I felt would be more useful for running an early-stage company.
But in late 2018, at age 19, I dropped out of college for a full-time job. Although I returned to college in late 2019, I dropped out again in late 2020, at the age of 21, to start my company, Intros AI.
Despite being diagnosed with cancer in early 2024 and having six months of chemotherapy, I pushed myself to work on the business. It was acquired in July 2025, setting me up financially after years of hard work.
I don't regret leaving college to pursue my own venture, even though there were trade-offs along the way.
BI's Young Geniuses series spotlights the next generation of founders, innovators, and thinkers who are trying to reshape industries and solve global challenges. See more stories from the series here, or reach out to editor Jess Orwig to share your story.
In 2018, after my freshman year, I started a product management internship at a company called Roll, where I focused on community engagement.
In November 2018, roughly three months after the internship ended, I was offered the opportunity to work full-time for Gary Vaynerchuk, the businessman and social media personality, at his company VaynerX.
I knew I'd have to drop out of college to take this on, and decided it wouldn't be too risky. If things didn't work out, I could always go back to school.
I had a passion for building tools for online communities and connecting people through software. While I worked at VaynerX, I built my own side projects: AI assistants focused on bringing people together.
In late 2019, after working at VaynerX for roughly eight months, I went back to college to gain more technical computer science skills, and worked on my side projects in my free time.
Even back then, I felt AI would play a huge role in how we interact. I experimented with AI assistants that could help you manage existing friendships or meet new people. One assistant, called ""MeetSunday,"" would introduce you to a new person via text, and book a time to meet.
I felt there was a bigger opportunity in this space and wanted to build software that helps communities connect their members. For example, if AI could send a personalized invitation to connect with someone within a big Slack or Facebook group, based on its knowledge of your shared interests and goals.
In late 2020, I dropped out of college again to focus on this idea full-time. I wanted to keep learning at school, but my main concern was timing. COVID had just hit, there was a new market for digital connection, and I was itching to get going with my company.
After eight months of bootstrapping, I began raising money from investors. Siriam Krishnan, who's now a senior White House policy advisor on artificial intelligence, was one of our early backers.
Our seed round started in late 2023. For eight or nine months, I'd been struggling with symptoms like itching, and in early 2024, I was diagnosed with stage four blood cancer.
My diagnosis taught me that time is scarce and I need to act urgently and intentionally. I was still working between 60 and 80 hours a week during my six months of chemotherapy. I felt like I didn't have a choice. We had great investors, and I'd put my whole life into this idea. I wanted to follow through on my commitment.
Prior to my diagnosis, I worked seven days a week, sometimes taking a half-day off. Afterward, I started taking most of my Saturdays off to rest, a habit I've kept.
I was told I was in remission in November 2024. In July 2025, Intros AI was acquired by a software company called Bevy.
We connected with Bevy at a conference in 2023, and by early 2025, we were considering a partnership. Along the way, they suggested acquiring us instead, and we closed a deal after six to seven months of negotiation. 
Today, companies use our product within Bevy to connect their most active customers to each other to create a meaningful space for knowledge-sharing and networking, helping to boost the company's customer retention.
In 2024, I was the CEO of Intros AI and, for that year, paid myself a salary of around $100,000. After the acquisition, I became an AI product manager at Bevy, and I'm now earning a higher base salary than I was, with the opportunity to boost my earnings through bonuses. Financially, it's been a big deal for me, having invested a lot in my company over the years.
I think starting and selling a company sets me up for the future in a way that a more traditional path wouldn't have.
Undoubtedly, I had to make trade-offs. Working long hours seven days a week meant saying no to many meaningful moments in my early 20s, like seeing friends.
But if you're going to make a dent in the world, there will absolutely be trade-offs along the way.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk could receive the largest corporate pay package in history worth as much as $878bn if he meets certain performance targets.
Here is what this means, and how Musk could become history’s first trillionaire.




Musk won a Tesla shareholder vote on Thursday, with more than 75 percent in favour, during the company’s annual general meeting at the electric carmaker’s factory in Austin, Texas.
Under this plan, Musk could be given stock worth $1 trillion over the next decade if he hits certain performance targets. However, he would be required to repay some of this to the company – bringing it down to $878bn.
Musk is already the richest man in the world, worth about $473bn, according to Bloomberg. This payout would take him over the $1-trillion line if he maintains this level of wealth.
Tesla shares jumped by 2 percent in pre-market trading on Friday, but have soared by more than 62 percent in the past six months.
After the announcement, Musk climbed on stage and danced while investors chanted his name.
He expressed triumph, as well as appreciation for the shareholders after the vote tally. “I super appreciate it,” he told the shareholders.
“Fantastic group of shareholders. Hang on to your Tesla stock,” Musk said.
“Other shareholder meetings are like snoozefests, but ours are bangers. I mean, look at this. This is sick,” Musk said.
Musk pledged to start production of a two-seater steering-less robotaxi called a “Cybercab” in April. He also promised to unveil Tesla’s next-generation Roadster electric sports car.
He added that Tesla will need to acquire large-scale chip manufacturing capabilities to support its move into artificial intelligence (AI). For this, the company may consider collaborating with Intel, one of the world’s largest semiconductor companies.
Optimus, unveiled as a prototype by the company in 2022, is designed to be an “autonomous humanoid robot” performing “unsafe, repetitive or boring tasks.”
“What we are about to embark upon is not merely a new chapter of the future of Tesla, but a whole new book,” Musk told a crowd of cheering stakeholders.
In order to get the pay package, Musk needs to meet a series of operational goals.
This includes manufacturing 20 million vehicles over the next decade, and bringing 1 million operational robotaxis to the roads.
He must attract 10 million subscriptions to Tesla’s Full Self-Driving feature on its cars.
He must also generate profits of up to $400bn.
Another condition is that Tesla’s market valuation must continue to rise above its current $1.5 trillion and reach set milestones, which start at $2 trillion.
After that, he must raise the valuation by nine tranches each of $500bn until the market valuation reaches $8.5 trillion by 2035.
The board’s proposal states that Musk would have to “completely transform Tesla and society as we know it” and he would get “zero” unless he meets the “incredibly ambitious” goals.
However, an analysis by the Reuters news agency, which weighed Musk’s performance goals, as well as insights from more than a dozen experts, found that Musk could still be paid more than $50bn by achieving just some of the board’s goals.
The deal also ties Musk to Tesla for the next 10 years.
The proposal was contentious, with some investors opposing it because of its massive scale. However, the Tesla board warned that Musk might leave the company if the vote did not pass.
Board members said the 75 percent vote in favour of the pay deal demonstrated investor confidence in the long-term leadership by Musk, who has ambitions to move further into AI – particularly by making progress with the Optimus robot, which was unveiled in 2022 and is designed to be an “autonomous humanoid robot” performing “unsafe, repetitive or boring tasks”.
Other investors have expressed doubts about the move towards AI, rather than focusing on electric vehicles. In a post on X, analyst Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said: “Let it sink in where Musk’s head is at. His vision of the ‘new book’ starts with Optimus.”
Major investors who opposed the deal included Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services.
Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, which is the Government Pension Fund of Norway, owned 1.14 percent of Tesla as of its half-year filings in June.
Glass Lewis is a California-headquartered corporate governance research and proxy advisory firm, while the Institutional Shareholder Services is a corporate governance and responsible investment solutions with headquarters in Maryland.
Musk will not receive cash or a salary under this pay deal. Instead, he will be awarded up to 423.7 million additional Tesla shares.

NPR's series Cost of Living: The Price We Pay is examining what's driving price increases and how people are coping after years of stubborn inflation. How are higher prices changing the way you live? Fill out this form to share your story with NPR.
Furniture
The price of bedroom furniture rose 11% since February 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The price of living room, kitchen and dining room furniture rose 25%.

Like all industries, furniture makers and sellers are dealing with higher expenses: utilities, insurance, wages. Big cost spikes came during the pandemic, when shoppers raced to buy desks for home offices and patio sets, and shipping costs soared.
But if you ask furniture industry insiders, the first thing they'll reply is that the price of furniture has actually grown slower than overall inflation, which has risen nearly 26% since February 2020. 
Then, the experts will note that prices are down from their peak in 2022. And then — like David Koehler did — they'll deliver the popular adage:
""You could buy a $399 sofa in 1984, and you could still buy a $399 sofa today,"" says Koehler, who runs the Delaware chain Johnny Janosik Furniture.
Of course, not everyone wants a $399 sofa, but the fact that it still exists makes furniture different from other big-ticket items, like cars or appliances.
Setting aside high-end woodwork and heirloom craftsmanship, sellers of mass market furniture feel intense pressure to keep prices down.
""The barriers to entry are very, very low, and the furniture business is incredibly fragmented,"" says Bill McLoughlin, editor in chief of Furniture Today, a trade publication.
Besides, furniture sellers compete not just with second-hand goods, but with any expensive plans you may have, say, for a trip or home repairs.
And the race for cheapest prices has moved a lot of the industry abroad.
""Manufacturing follows low-cost labor. That has been true for 60 years,"" says McLoughlin. ""Because labor is such a large component of the cost of a product.""
American wages tend to be a lot higher than those overseas, on top of the bigger costs of U.S. environmental standards. So even at domestic furniture-making hubs in Mississippi or North Carolina, many components — fabrics, handles and electronics, like the power button for your recliner — still ship from abroad, mainly China.
During his first term, President Trump's tariffs made it pricier to ship furniture from China, so a lot of manufacturing moved out — though not to America, but to Vietnam.
This year, Trump raised tariffs on imports from almost all countries. And he's set new double-digit tariffs specifically for kitchen cabinets, vanities and upholstered furniture.
The furniture giant Ashley Furniture in June raised the price of the majority of its products as a result of tariffs. The Home Furnishings Association, an industry trade group, has warned of cumulative cost increases for both retailers and shoppers.
As importing furniture becomes pricier, American-made furniture may start looking more attractive in comparison. But seller Koehler worries about how shoppers will react.
""The consumer, when we get feedback, they say, 'We would love to buy American,'"" he says. ""But when they vote with their dollars and see, this item is $500 and that item is $1,200, they say, 'I think I can only afford the $500.' So they end up buying an imported item anyway, just because there is such a difference in price.""
Many shoppers find themselves in the same spot as Erin Cummins in Connecticut: watching their spending rise on other, more critical costs, such as health insurance, or car insurance, or groceries.
""Every time we're having company over, I look at that furniture and I'm going, 'I really need to replace that,'"" says Cummins, whose threadbare couches have been well-loved by three dogs and three children. ""I have priced it out a bit, but every time I do, I get sticker shock and walk away.""
Cummins says at this point, the cost of new furniture displeases her more than the state of what she already owns, and her couches — still standing, even if covered by a blanket — feel more stable than her budget.

OpenAI's new web browser, Atlas, has been available for less than two weeks — and only on Apple computers, for now — but it's getting a lot of attention.
That's because it's a new kind of browser in a market dominated by Google Chrome. And it comes from OpenAI, the leader in AI chatbots, at a time when artificial intelligence is starting to give traditional web search a run for its money.
""We think that AI represents a rare, once-a-decade opportunity to re-think what a browser can be about,"" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on a livestream to launch the browser.
Atlas comes with ChatGPT baked in, and while it can navigate the web like traditional browsers, the company says it can do much more. A feature that OpenAI calls ""agentic mode"" can take action, like an agent who can shop for you, make reservations, or buy plane tickets. On that livestream, Altman's colleague demonstrated how it can read an online recipe, figure out how many ingredients are needed for a set of diners, then buy the ingredients online.
OpenAI says it wants to unlock the power of AI, but some analysts see increased risks. The large language models that underpin artificial intelligence require vast quantities of data to improve.
OpenAI has ""kind of reached the limits of what data they can get just by hoovering up all of the content that's visible on the internet without consent,"" said Anil Dash, a tech entrepreneur and writer.
But because Atlas is intertwined with ChatGPT, it absorbs much more user data than an ordinary browser does. The browser can interact with your email, for instance, or Google docs. It can keep so-called ""browser memories"" — details from the sites you've visited — so that OpenAI can better understand you.
""I think a big, big, big part of this is they are hoping to use the people who downloaded this browser as their agents to getting access to even more data,"" Dash said. ""I would not be surprised if there is more information going to them than coming to the user.""
That makes for a privacy trade-off. If you're letting that AI agent shop for your dinner party, it'll need a payment method, and maybe some passwords. It might also need to check your calendars, and personal contacts.
Lena Cohen is a Technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, has data privacy concerns about browsers acting as agents.
""The agentic AI mode takes these risks to a whole new level,"" she said.
Users are potentially handing more control to OpenAI than they might think, she said. ""Once your data is on OpenAI's servers it's hard to know and control what they do with it,"" Cohen added.
NPR reached out to OpenAI with questions related to data and security, and was referred to company statements online and their Atlas demo video. In those, the company says its default is to not use information users pull up on Atlas to train its AI models, but people can opt in.
Cohen flagged another potential risk that experts think could be particularly dangerous with AI browsers like Atlas — nefarious pieces of code hidden in websites called ""prompt injections.""
""Basically, bad actors can hide malicious instructions on a web page, and so when your AI agent visits that page, it could be tricked into executing those instructions,"" she said.
For example, that AI agent browsing for groceries could bump into a prompt injection that says, ""Buy this product, instead of that one."" Or maybe it says, ""Hand over your credit card information.""
OpenAI says this is an unsolved problem, but they're working on training their models to ignore those harmful instructions.
Chirag Shah, a professor with the Information School at the University of Washington, says AI has become a phenomenon at warp speed, with minimal regulation, and there have been consequences. 
""We're in this kind of game where it's a typical mentality of move fast and break. Unfortunately, what's breaking is not just the tool or the technology, but real people,"" he said.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Angus Rittenburg, the 33-year-old CEO of Wynk in New Jersey. It has been edited for length and clarity.
Before becoming a CEO, I worked as a mechanical design engineer at Tesla in Palo Alto, California, from 2015 to 2017. I first did an internship with Tesla, where I developed an innovative battery technology that we ultimately patented. Tesla was my first job out of college.
In Tesla's fast-paced and dynamic environment, I focused on designing the Model 3 battery architecture. I designed a lot of the electrical, mechanical, and thermal components. Otherwise, I was in meetings and coordinating with hundreds of other engineers.
I left Tesla with the goal of starting my own thing, and later, in 2021, I launched Wynk, a THC beverage company, with my cofounders Casey Parzych and Shawn Sheehan.
I took many lessons with me from Tesla — including three that I've carried into starting my own business.
At Tesla, I learned that the right answer is usually simple. The problems we were solving were incredibly complex, with requirements ranging from vehicle performance to crash test safety standards to energy density. 
I learned that any complex problem becomes easier to solve if you break it into parts and find the simplest solution for each one. It took me two years to figure that out at Tesla, but I've carried that knowledge forward ever since.
The first challenge we encountered with Wynk was getting started. When we began, there weren't many THC brands at all in the US, but it was growing quickly in Canada, where it was federally legal. 
In the US, in 2021, you needed a production facility in every single state where you wanted to sell. Then, further complicating it, you needed a cannabis license for each facility. 
We came up with a simple solution. We decided to build one facility, but made it mobile so we could move it from state to state. We designed an entire canning facility on a 53-foot tractor-trailer.
Then, rather than obtaining cannabis licenses ourselves, we partnered with individuals who already had them and brought their production capability to them. We took a complex, challenging situation and made it simple.
Another thing I learned from Tesla was the importance of quality. Tesla has an absolute obsession with quality, meticulously testing every individual part of the vehicle to ensure it meets the highest standards.
When we started Wynk, this was also important to us. I purchased all the lab equipment that cannabis testing facilities typically use, allowing us to perform all necessary quality testing in-house and not solely rely on third-party labs. 
We've done this since day one — performing all of our own internal testing before sending anything to a third party. This ensures that all products coming off the line are flawless and that consumers receive the highest-quality product.
If we tell our consumers that Wynk has five milligrams of THC, we need to ensure it stays consistent throughout its entire shelf life. To achieve this, we invested heavily in testing equipment and personnel early on so that when we formulated the product, it was guaranteed to be stable and accurately dosed.
I'd say the one thing Tesla does better than anybody is that they only hire the best of the best. We've done the same with Wynk. We've hired people with decades of experience in the alcohol space. 
They know the alcohol playbook and how you should market alcohol. Wynk sells through beer, wine, and spirits distributors, as well as alcohol-licensed retail. 
No matter the company, it's always about investing in really good talent who bring new ideas that actually make sense for the industry.
At Tesla, I never had to worry about building teams in HR, finance, legal, recruiting, benefits, and all the other foundational elements required for starting a business. Tesla was well-established, well-staffed, and well-run. When we started Wynk, we had to build it from scratch.
It turns out that startup businesses' hardest problems are often the simple things that every business has already figured out.
Tesla taught me how to solve problems extremely effectively, even under immense pressure, and also how to work within a large set of disparate constraints, including safety, performance, regulations, reliability, crash test standards, design for manufacturing, and more, while delivering an exceptional final product for consumers. 
I wouldn't work for Tesla again — being a founder is too fun. But I am extremely thankful for my time at Tesla and the lessons learned.

Taco Bell just launched a frozen pie that — defying all laws of both chemistry and good taste — is Mountain Dew Baja Blast-flavored. I had to try it myself.
Taco Bell ties the pie's release to ""Friendsgiving,"" which makes sense because the holiday is in the purview of the Bell's target Gen Z demographic — and also because your decidedly not Gen Z Aunt Linda would absolutely murder you if you showed up with a bright green pie to your family's Thanksgiving.
But more on that later. Let's talk pie.
Thursday was the first day the pie was available in stores. I headed over to my local Taco Bell after calling to make sure it was in stock.
There were no promotional signs about the creation except on the big menu screen above the registers. I entered my burrito order on the self-serve kiosk, but couldn't find the pie on the touchscreen menu. I had to go to the register — and sheepishly ask a real human for the pie.
At last, it was mine.
I brought the pie home, since the directions said to thaw it for 30 minutes and cut it with a warm knife. (The pie is $19.99 and is full-sized, meant for sharing. It can't be bought by the slice, and of course, is available only while supplies last, Taco Bell says.)
The pie came with a plastic lid to protect it from smushing in the box, and was shrink-wrapped, lest you mistake it for a pie from your local bakery.
A word about the color of the pie, which is a bright teal, the hue of the iconic '90s ""jazz"" pattern of paper cups.
Certain animal species have evolved to display glaringly bright colors, warning predators of their venomous nature. The poison dart frog, for example.
Evolution has also provided humans with an instinct to avoid certain dangerous foods by eliciting a disgust response. Trypophobia, a fear of things with patterns of holes or spots, is one of these mechanisms, causing us to be repulsed by rotten or unsafe foods.
Every piece of my DNA should have fired off a warning signal when I saw the color of the Baja Blast pie. Eons of evolution, knowledge built from when our great ape ancestors descended from the trees, should have instinctively told me that this is not food — do not put this in your mouth.
But that isn't the Live Más spirit.
I took a bite.
The pie isn't totally unlike a Key-lime pie in theory. The green part is more custardy and creamy, but it has a subtle, citrusy flavor. I can't really describe what ""Mountain Dew Baja Blast"" tastes like — I don't think anyone can — but the flavor wasn't as intense as in the drink. Mixed with the pie crust and the white cream topping, it was well-balanced. Sweet, sure. Slightly unnatural, sure. But … it was good. I finished my whole slice and put the pie back in the freezer, looking forward to having a slice later, after dinner.
So the obvious question is: Why? Why would Taco Bell, which sells fast food, sell a novelty item that's a whole pie to take home? And why make it such a glaring abomination of a flavor?
Here's the short answer: Gen Z loves drinks.
And Taco Bell loves Gen Z customers.
Right now, Taco Bell is doing well among Yum! Brands' portfolio (which includes KFC and Pizza Hut), in part because it's successful with young customers. It's leaned into the value menu; meanwhile, Chipotle is struggling with younger customers who are turning away from its higher prices. (Other fast casual chains like SweetGreen and Cava are also facing challenges.)
""It's clear across its product, marketing, and expansion strategies that Taco Bell is making a concerted effort to win over Gen Z,"" said Michael Della Penna, chief strategy officer at market researcher InMarket.
And a ""Friendsgiving"" — Thanksgiving spent with friends rather than family — is a holiday perfectly suited for 20-somethings living in the big city or at school who aren't flying home. A food product marketed to this holiday in particular is a Gen Z bat signal.
Then there's the Baja Blast tie-in. It's Taco Bell's signature drink, and basing a new product around the beverage makes sense when you consider how Taco Bell wants to lean into the beverage market.
It's launching Live Más Cafes (30 across California and Texas this fall), which feature specialty beverage items like blended iced drinks, directly competing with Starbucks.
""Cafe concepts or innovative desserts provide low-cost ways to connect and enjoy little sweet treats, especially as younger generations cut back on alcohol and navigate economic uncertainty,"" Della Penna told Business Insider.
And young people love a sweet treat drink! Plus, the Baja Blast pie has a dose of irony and nostalgia. It's meme food. This is appealing to young people.
My verdict? The pie is surprisingly tasty and will probably appear at some young people's gatherings as a gag item this fall. But please — do not bring it to real Thanksgiving.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Brendan Pon, 36, an entrepreneur and part-time content creator in Osaka, Japan. It has been edited for length and clarity.
I was born and raised in Toronto. I spent 10 years as a recruiter specializing in senior-level accounting roles. Before that, I was an accountant myself.
My wife and I had a comfortable, predictable life with our two kids, but we wanted something new. They're both under five, and we wanted to make the most of these early years by being present in their lives.
In North America, it feels like you have to prioritize working just to keep up with the cost of living. We felt that moving abroad would allow us to take a step back, work less, and spend more time with our kids.
It made more sense to take the leap sooner rather than later. That way, if it didn't work out, we'd still have time to make money again or adjust our careers.
We moved to Chiang Mai, Thailand, in May 2024. Even though we'd visited before, once we settled in, we realized it wasn't the right fit.
It felt like we were living in an expat bubble, and we struggled to integrate into the local community. It didn't help that the weather was super hot all year round.
That's when we started looking again. Japan had always been on our radar, and with the yen at a low, we began exploring its real estate market. 
We discovered visa options that could make a move possible and decided on Osaka. It had an international airport, good food options, and all the conveniences of Tokyo, but on a more livable scale.
We wanted to be in a family-friendly neighborhood with easy access to parks, grocery stores, and train stations. We also wanted something newly built and move-in ready.
We visited Osaka in November 2024. While we toured a few properties on that trip, none of them ended up being the one we bought, although the experience helped us get a sense of the market.
After returning to Thailand, we found the house we wanted online. We bought a new house remotely, with the help of a real estate agent, for 49.8 million Japanese yen, or about $320,000.
We officially moved to Osaka in July. Our neighborhood is about 98% Japanese. There's a retirement home down the street, but there are also numerous young families living here.
We've gotten to know our Japanese neighbors well, and we hang out with them a lot.
That said, the language barrier has been the hardest part of the move, especially when dealing with paperwork and bureaucracy, but everyone's patience and kindness have helped. I have also started language lessons.
Our son attends a local kindergarten, and our daughter goes to a part-time international nursery.
We don't have a car, so we bike everywhere. After picking up the kids from school, we usually head to the pool or playground.
On weekends, we try to do a lot of bigger things, like taking the train or renting a car for an overnight trip. But we've only been here for a few months, so we're still developing a routine.
We also have a dog, which we brought over from Canada, so we make sure to take him out for walks and help him socialize, too.
Moving to two countries in just over a year showed me how resilient we are.
My daughter is still very young, so she doesn't really know what's going on. But my son, who's turning five, has been really open-minded and adjusted well both times we moved. It helped that we looped him in on all the conversations from the start.
Our kids have adapted easily, and the slower pace has allowed us to be fully present as a family.
We did this whole journey because we wanted to be in control of our lives. Too often, people don't realize there are other paths out there — they just keep doing the same thing their whole lives.
It took financial planning and courage to make this leap, but so far the experience has been rewarding.

YouTube TV isn't budging in its high-profile fight with Disney — and it has leverage beyond its Google backing.
The popular pay-TV service has become an industry titan in its own right and is on track to catch its cable TV rivals in the coming years, analysts say.
Disney's TV networks, like ESPN and ABC, have been gone from the Google-owned TV service for over a week. The Mouse House insists that YouTube isn't properly valuing its channels, while YouTube TV is telling its customers that giving in would lead to higher prices.
Disney and ESPN have made the case that YouTube is being unreasonable and can afford to play hardball in negotiations since it's owned by Google. While Disney is a corporate behemoth, worth $200 billion, it's roughly 17 times smaller than Google-parent Alphabet, which is the fourth-largest company in the world with a $3.4 trillion market value.
But YouTube TV isn't some dinky business that's propped up by a generous tech giant. It's a robust operation that generates lots of cash, even if it's not yet a major needle-mover for Alphabet.
Ric Prentiss of Raymond James wrote in a note that this fight is ""indicative of YouTube TV wielding increased bargaining power.""
YouTube TV has been the fastest-growing major TV provider over the last few years, rising from 2 million subscribers in late 2019 to about 10 million paying customers, while most of its competitors have shrunk.
Google's live TV service is now the third-biggest pay-TV provider behind only cable giants Charter and Comcast, according to analysts at MoffettNathanson. The research firm estimates that YouTube TV will pass those incumbents in the next two years and become the industry leader.
""Given the rapid growth of YouTube TV — especially in the context of the accelerating decline of traditional Pay TV providers — it is quickly becoming a crucial player in the linear TV ecosystem,"" MoffettNathanson's Michael Nathanson wrote earlier this year.
MoffettNathanson estimates that YouTube TV has grown its revenue from less than $1 billion in 2019 to just under $8 billion in 2024, and earlier this year was on pace to hit $9.6 billion in 2025. The firm believes YouTube TV will generate $11.6 billion for Google by the end of 2027.
That growth came despite competition from other ""virtual pay-TV services,"" which brought the traditional pay-TV channel bundle to streaming. The first movers were Fubo and Sling TV, which both launched more than two years before YouTube TV in early 2015. Other competitors, such as Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV Now, now known as DirecTV Stream, arrived a few years later. These services are especially popular with younger audiences who love streaming and sports fans who want to see games in one convenient place.
YouTube TV became by far the biggest and best-known of the bunch. However, like its rivals, it faces existential questions about the future of the pay-TV bundle.
Sports have begun to migrate to stand-alone streaming services — as opposed to streamers like YouTube TV that bundle traditional TV channels — in recent years. Some games now stream exclusively on these services, such as ""Thursday Night Football"" on Amazon's Prime Video or NBA and NFL games on Peacock. That shift has accelerated cord-cutting, which also affects YouTube TV.
Although YouTube TV might not be a make-or-break business for Google and Alphabet, it's not a struggling vanity project. Instead, it's a key part of a strategic vision to own the living room.
It's difficult to see how Disney could afford not to be in business with YouTube TV, now that it has become a top pay-TV provider. Similarly, YouTube and Google can hardly afford to spurn Disney, assuming they're set on being a major player in the TV market.

David Cogginsâ No-Nonsense Guide to Embracing the Holiday Season. The holiday season is approaching, and repeat AoM podcast guest David Coggins has an article on Artful Living on how to embrace the festivities with some grace and style. A few of his suggestions that stood out to me: keep holiday gatherings simple, consumable indulgences like French butter cookies make a solid gift, always write a handwritten thank you note, and use the season to make some bold sartorial choices like wearing tartan pants. This article is classic Coggins: thoughtful without being precious, elegant without being stuffy.
Japanese Rib Knit Beanie. As the temperatures start to fall around here, my morning walks get nippy, and I begin busting out this beanie. Crafted in Japan in a classic fisherman design that never goes out of style. Comes in different colors. Pick up one (or two) for the winter season. They make a great stocking stuffer!
Hemingway vs. Fitzgerald: The Rise and Fall of a Literary Friendship by Scott Donaldson. Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald were a study in opposites; the former was rugged and stoic; the latter delicate and romantic. Yet they had a genius for writing in common and for a time became very close friends; Fitzgerald was the only friend Hemingway ever said he âloved.â Fitzgerald forever idolized Hemingway, but Hemingway grew increasingly contemptuous of Fitzgerald’s self-destructive behavior, and complex dynamics of rivalry and jealousy would eventually unravel their relationship. This book not only traces the rise and fall of their friendship, but also provides plenty of details about their lives and writing, so that it serves as a decent biography of both men as well.
King of the Tenors by Ben Webster. We featured this album in our guide to getting into jazz. And for good reason. Lots of great songs on here. Ben Webster’s version of âTenderlyâ shows what made him special. He’s got a breathy, vocal vibrato at the ends of phrases that feels like itâs coming from his throat, not his sax. “That’s All” is a great song to put on your Thanksgiving playlist. If you think jazz is all frenetic bebop or abstract noodling, this will change your mind. Websterâs tone is warm and lyrical.

Quote of the Week
Let us do our duty in our shop or our kitchen, in the market, the street, the office, the school, the home, just as faithfully as if we stood in the front rank of some great battle, and knew that victory for mankind depended on our bravery, strength, and skill. When we do that, the humblest of us will be serving in that great army which achieves the welfare of the world.

77,2025-11-07,"SanDisk's just released the tiniest 1-TB Type-C drive on the market today. It's like a stubby little dongle that you'd usually use as a wireless receiver for a mouse or game controller, and despite its diminutive size, it actually boasts pretty decent performance.
The SanDisk Extreme Fit USB-C weighs just 1/10th of an ounce (3 g), about the same as one US penny, meaning you can plug it in and just leave it there. You can already get 1-TB thumb drives, but they're the size of regular thumb drives and don't all offer quick read and write speeds. This one uses the USB 3.2 Gen 1 interface, so it can manage read speeds of up to 400 MB/s. It's the smallest one of its kind in the world with this much storage.
While it's not the fastest drive out there, it should be good enough for expanding your photo and video storage when you're working out in the field. And since it's got a Type-C connector, it can plug into Windows and macOS laptops, as well as iPads running iPadOS 15 and up.
I recently bought an M4-powered MacBook Air from 2024, and felt it was really reasonably priced given its battery life, performance, and the longevity you can usually expect from one of these laptops. But I really felt the pinch of the US$200 I had to shell out for just 256 GB more onboard storage.
The Extreme Fit comes in at around half that, for nearly four times the extra storage. Given my more resource-heavy workflows, which involve photo editing, recording music, and some graphic design, I could comfortably get by with a base model MacBook Air and this 1-TB nubbin.
The Extreme Fit comes in a bunch of storage capacities. The 1 TB is listed at $117.99, but you can order it on SanDisk's site for $109.99 at the time of writing. It's also available on Amazon in the US, where it's presently listed a bit higher at $119.99 and is temporarily out of stock at the time of writing.
If you don't need that much space but still want a barely-there drive, you can opt for 64-GB ($14.99), 128-GB ($19.99), 256-GB ($27.99), or 512-GB ($52.99) versions that are all the same size on the outside. Samsung makes a small 400-MB/s Type-C drive too, but that tops out at 512 GB, is a bit larger (about half the length of a regular thumb drive), and costs $20 more.
If you absolutely need faster performance, you'll have to compromise on price and get a normal-sized thumb drive. SanDisk makes those too: its USB 3.2 Gen 2-based Extreme Pro Dual Drive has a USB-A and a USB-C port on either end, and can move files around at up to 1,000 MB/s (read) and 900 MB/s (write); the 1-TB version will cost you $99.99 from SanDisk or Amazon.

78,2025-11-07,"One said she's being ""run out of my country because of healthcare costs.""
Colorado mom Astrid Storey, a thyroid cancer patient with an autoimmune disorder, was recently notified that her monthly premiums under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will jump by nearly $500 in 2026. A naturalized U.S. citizen from Panama, she said she's now contemplating what was once unthinkable: giving up her American dream and moving to a country with universal health care.
Nathan Boye of Orlando, Florida, has diabetes and said he's been informed the monthly premiums for his ACA policy would soar from $28 to more than $700. The married father-of-three said he is now considering foregoing health insurance altogether.
And Doug Butchart, whose wife, Shadene, is living with the neurological disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) said he doesn't know how he's going to pay for her medications. A retired mechanic from Elgin, Illinois, Butchart said he's gotten a notice that the monthly premiums on his wife's ACA policy will climb to $2,000. Combined with an annual deductible of more than $8,000 and $10,000 in out-of-pocket expenses, he said his wife's health care costs will total more than his monthly Social Security check, which they both live on.
An estimated 22 million of the 24 million ACA marketplace enrollees are currently receiving enhanced premium tax credits to lower their monthly premiums, which were part of the original ACA legislation and expanded in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic under the American Rescue Plan. But with the tax credits set to expire at the end of this year, many policyholders are learning the ACA, commonly referred to as Obamacare, will no longer be affordable unless Congress intervenes.
An extension of the tax credits was not included in President Donald Trump's megabill, which was signed into law in July.
The issue has become a political football, prolonging the government shutdown, now the longest in U.S. history.
The majority of Democrats have refused to vote to reopen the government until Republicans agree to extend the ACA subsidies. But GOP leaders say they won't negotiate until a clean funding bill passes and the government reopens.
As both sides blame each other for the shutdown, millions of Americans who bought into the ACA marketplace find themselves caught in the crossfire of the stalemate.
Storey, a graphic designer and owner of a small business in Denver, said she doesn't receive the ACA tax credits. But in a notice from her insurance provider, Blue Cross Blue Shield, which she shared with ABC News, her monthly premiums are set to rise from $1,400 to nearly $1,900.
""I have an autoimmune disease, and I also have thyroid cancer. So, I had very specific needs as to which doctors and which medicines I needed to have covered in this plan,"" Storey said, adding that she has a $2,000 deductible and many out-of-pocket expenses.
Storey, 45, said she purchased her policy through Connect for Health Colorado, her state's ACA portal, and has been working with a broker provided by the insurance carrier to help navigate the added costs.
Storey said her husband, Denis, who has been doing contracting work for her business, has taken a part-time job at a Starbucks to help make ends meet. But Storey said there is a limit to how much more she can pay for health care.
If her premium rises to $2,500 a month, she said that she and her family will sell all their belongings and leave the country. Storey said she also has citizenship in Panama and Spain, the latter of which has universal health care.
""I have a lot of feelings about being run out of my country because of health care costs,"" Storey said. ""The American dream is a disappointment when it comes to health care.""
In a statement to ABC News, Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield said that its ACA plan rates ""reflect the care and costs we expect members to use next year. Like other insurers, we’re seeing higher utilization and more complex care among ACA members -- particularly in emergency room visits, behavioral health and specialty pharmacy. For instance, ACA members use the ER at nearly twice the rate of those with employer-sponsored coverage.""
Boye, from Florida, said he currently pays $28 a month for his ACA plan through Blue Cross Blue Shield, and that 90% of the medications he needs to control his diabetes are covered.
He was notified last month that the monthly premium is set to rise to $733 without financial help, a 2,518% increase.
Boye told ABC News on Thursday that after doing more research and reapplying through the ACA portal, he found a plan that has monthly premiums of $113 a month, contingent on a $620 tax credit.
Boye said he qualified for the ACA tax credits after he was laid off earlier this year as an operations manager for a company that imported medical supplies from China.
""We had to close down because of the tariff. It made it impossible to import,"" Boye said.
While he has picked up part-time work, he said he enrolled at Valencia College in Orlando to finish his degree in business administration.
His wife, he said, has insurance through her job as a teacher's assistant at the University of Central Florida, where she is also studying history. He said their three children, ages 11 to 16, are insured through Medicaid.
Boye said he won't be able to pay the increase in his premiums, and is hoping Congress works out a deal to restore the ACA tax credits.
He said he has until mid-December to reenroll in his plan. But if the tax credits are not restored, Boye said he is contemplating making a radical change.
""I gave up on the idea of having health care,"" Boye said.
Boye said he's already started researching discount drug companies and cash-pay programs on how he can purchase on his own the two primary medications he uses to control diabetes. He showed ABC News an invoice he got in September indicating his insurance covered the $1,669 price of his primary medication, Jardiance.
Boye said his current predicament has left him feeling like a ""tiny fish that does not matter.""
""Realistically, I have no control over any of this,"" he said. ""I'm just a person who has to navigate the waters and find a solution.""
In a statement to ABC News, a spokesperson for Florida Blue said that, next year, there will be ""higher insurance costs for many, and government financial help (premium tax credits) will decrease if the enhanced premium tax credits expire, as they are planned to.""
The organization said it understood members' concerns and is committed to supporting members, but added that premium increases ""are an industry-wide issue, a necessary but concerning response to federal regulatory changes including the scheduled expiration of the enhanced premium tax credits at the end of 2025, as well as the rising cost and utilization of medical care and prescription drugs.""
The Butcharts, from Illinois, traveled to Washington, D.C., this week with members of the Muscular Dystrophy Association to discuss their precarious situation with congressional leaders, including their two Illinois senators, Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, both Democrats.
The 67-year-old Doug Butchart said he wanted to show the lawmakers ""that it's for real, that it's real people that all of this is affecting.""
Butchart said he has received notification, which he shared with ABC News, that the monthly premiums on his wife's ACA policy through Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois will rise from $603.82 to up to $2,000 without the tax credits in 2026. According to the notice he received, even with a tax credit estimated at $738, the monthly premium would be nearly $1,400.
""It's insane,"" Butchart told ABC News.
He said his 58-year-old wife was diagnosed with ALS eight years ago, adding that about 10% of ALS patients survive that long.
Butchart said his wife's main medication, Radicava, costs about $15,000 a month, and another medication costs $4,000 for a three-month supply.
While insurance has covered most of their medical costs, Butchart said his wife's out-of-pocket expenses last year were about $3,000.
He said that without the tax credits, and on top of the increased monthly premiums, his wife will have an $8,000 deductible in 2026, and her out-of-pocket expenses could top $10,000.
""That's a lot of money, way more money than we get in a year,"" said Butchart.
He said he and his wife live off his Social Security income and that she does not qualify for Medicaid or any disability income.
""I don't want to put ourselves in a position where we're in debt. I'm not 20 years old or 30 years old where I can go out and get a second job,"" Butchart said.
In a statement to ABC News, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois said it ""remains steadfast in its commitment to a stable health insurance market with competitive plan choices in the individual market, as we have since the inception of the ACA.""
""The rates for 2026 coverage include both new and current individual ACA-compliant plans and reflects industry-wide changes to the market, including the anticipated expiration of enhanced premium tax credits at the end of 2025. Plans are priced to reflect anticipated health care needs,"" the company said.
But Butchart said the he still doesn't see how the company can ""justify"" such increases in premiums.
“I wish the people who are making decisions and setting the prices were in the same position as we are,"" Butchart said.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on Friday played down the possibility of his company selling its AI chips in China anytime soon, as restrictions have left Nvidia basically wiped out of the Chinese market.
“There are no active discussions,"" Huang said in Taiwan, in remarks reported by Bloomberg. “Currently, we’re not planning to ship anything to China. It’s up to China when they would like Nvidia products to go back to serve the Chinese market. I look forward to them changing their policy, and hopefully we’ll be able to serve the Chinese market again.”
There had been speculation that a new trade deal between the U.S. and China might pave the way for Nvidia to sell its advanced Blackwell AI chips to Chinese companies. But even as the countries struck a trade war truce late last month, President Donald Trump indicated that Nvidia will have to reserve its most advanced chips for U.S. companies and hold them back from China and other countries.
Huang said last month that the company’s China business is now “100% out,” describing a collapse from “95% market share to 0%” as U.S. and Chinese policy slammed the door on the company from both sides. 
“In all of our forecasts, we assume zero for China,” he said at a Citadel Securities event. “If anything happens there — which I hope it will — that will be a bonus.”
At the company's annual developers conference last week in Washington, Huang said China has ""made it very clear that they don’t want Nvidia to be there right now. I hope that will change in the future.”

85,2025-11-07,"The OnePlus 15 arrives globally on November 13, bringing some serious competition to Samsung's flagship.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

 




A battery pack like no other
The OnePlus 15 arrives with Qualcomm's finest processor, a humongous battery, extreme waterproofing, and some of the best cameras. It offers all this in a very unassuming body, making it one of the best flagships you should be considering going into 2026.
 




Still one of the best
The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra needs no introduction. It's one of the best Android flagships in the market and has one of the longest software update commitments. The built-in S Pen stylus is still one of its most unique features which the OnePlus 15 lacks. It is more expensive though, but you get a lot for your money.
In a few months, we'll be witnessing an avalanche of flagship Android phones equipped with the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 SoC. Kicking off the party is OnePlus with the global launch of the OnePlus 15, expected to take place on November 13. Besides sporting the new Qualcomm chip, this new flagship also features a new design for the series, a much larger battery, and the latest software with more AI improvements. This large-screened phone then competes nicely with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, an equally premium flagship.
In the battle for being the best Android smartphone, the Galaxy S25 Ultra already has an edge with the S Pen, more years of OS upgrades, and a brighter display. It's more expensive, though, which is where the OnePlus 15 comes in with equally compelling features but at a lower price. The official global specs of the 15 shouldn't be too different from the recently launched China variant, so let's see what a OnePlus 15 vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra actually looks like when we break it down.
 



The first thing you'll notice about the OnePlus 15 is that the camera bump is no longer circular, but rather a square. Its predecessor's design was quite unique, but the 15 resembles the OnePlus 13s or Oppo's new Find X9 Pro. Neither of these phones is officially sold in the North American market, though, which makes the design of the OnePlus 15 stand out.
For a phone with a massive battery, OnePlus has managed to keep the thickness and weight comparable to the Galaxy S25 Ultra. As before, there's also an IP69 rating for extreme waterproofing.
The OnePlus 15 also features a relatively large display of 6.78 inches. It features an LTPO AMOLED panel with a staggering 165Hz refresh rate and a pixel-dense screen. The resolution is still a bit lower than what Samsung offers with the S25 Ultra, though this shouldn't really matter with regular use. The peak brightness is also lower, reaching a maximum of 1,800 nits. From what we've seen so far, the phone appears to have extremely thin bezels around the display, which enhances immersion when viewing content.
 



The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is physically larger than the OnePlus 15, both in thickness and weight. The more angular edges of the phone also make it more cumbersome to handle, especially for those with smaller hands. The IP rating is only IP68, which isn't as comprehensive as the OnePlus 15 IP rating. You do get the S Pen with it, though, which is handy for jotting down notes or signing documents.
The Galaxy S25 Ultra features a larger 6.9-inch display compared to the OnePlus 15, along with higher brightness of up to 2,600 nits and a denser resolution. One unique feature that's not present on most flagship phones is an anti-reflective coating over the display, which helps reduce glare and reflections significantly.

In terms of ergonomics and display quality, the OnePlus 15 should have an edge over the S25 Ultra. The gentler curves on the 15 should make it easier to live with, and the incredible refresh rate should come in handy when gaming.
 



The OnePlus 15 should be the better phone for gaming. This is not just because it features a faster Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip, but also due to the various software optimizations implemented in OxygenOS 16. The company is introducing a new Hyper Rendering technology, which is said to improve per-frame rendering efficiency by 80%. This, along with other on-chip optimizations, positions the 15 as one of the best smartphones for gaming.
The China variant offers 12GB and 16GB RAM options, as well as storage tiers that range up to 1TB. This could change with the global variant, so we'll have to wait and see what the rest of the world gets.
The OnePlus 15 boasts a massive battery of 7,300mAh, which significantly outperforms the 5,000mAh capacity of the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Charging speeds of the China variant are as follows: 120W wired and 50W wireless. The charging speeds could also differ slightly in the global variant, so we'll know what we're getting soon enough.
The OnePlus 15 will launch in three colors called Infinite Black, Ultra Violet, and Sand Storm. There's no word on the pricing yet till it officially launches on November 13, but expect to start at around $900, like its predecessor.

The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is not even a year old, which means it still has plenty of life left in it. In fact, Samsung plans on supporting it with OS upgrades and security patches for the next seven years. The custom Snapdragon 8 Elite chip in the Ultra is also plenty powerful for gaming and multitasking. In benchmarks and certain AI tasks, the new Gen 5 in the OnePlus 15 may surpass it, but most users should not notice a significant difference in day-to-day usage.
The Galaxy S25 Ultra can be equipped with up to 1TB of storage and features 12GB of RAM across its variants. The 5,000mAh battery might not be as large as the 15's, but it's nothing to scoff at either. In our testing, we were quite happy with the multi-day battery life it offered. Charging speeds are not the quickest either, but it gets the job done. The S25 Ultra is Qi2-ready, which means it can do magnetic wireless charging with the help of the right case.
The S25 Ultra comes in more colors, including some exclusive shades if you buy it via Samsung's website. It still costs over $1,000, though, even with the small price reduction since its debut in January 2025.
 



Over the years, OnePlus' number series has typically had good primary cameras, but their selfie and secondary cameras have either hit or missed the mark, depending on the generation. With the OnePlus 15, the company ditches the Hasselblad branding in favor of its in-house DetailMax Engine. It's still early days, but our initial experience with the OnePlus 15's cameras shows a marked improvement in image quality, compared to its predecessor.
On the back, the 15 sports three 50MP sensors for the main, telephoto, and ultrawide cameras. Selfies are handled by a 32-megapixel camera. We will be testing the cameras further and have the full report in our review, so watch out for that.
 



Samsung didn't make any major changes to the Galaxy S25 Ultra's camera system from its predecessor, except for the ultrawide, which now has a 48MP sensor. Our previous issues with the Ultra series, like shutter lag, have also been reduced quite a bit, although there's room for improvement.
It's still one of the best phones for zoom shots, thanks to the dual telephoto system that allows it to reach a magnification of 100x. Image quality is generally good during the day and at night, and extra features like Expert RAW and Camera Assistant offer a great deal of flexibility for professional and amateur photographers.
 



Personally, we'd pick the new OnePlus 15 for that massive battery, latest Qualcomm chip, and the IP69 waterproofing. With every SoC iteration, we get better performance and power efficiency, which means it's a little less stress on the battery when doing intensive workloads like gaming or AI processing. Considering how on-device AI workloads on phones are only getting stronger with every passing year, it's nice to know you have the hardware that's capable of doing such tasks efficiently.
Long-term software support is something where OnePlus still has a lot of catching up to do, and if you plan to hold on to your purchase for more than four years, you would be better off with the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Seven years of updates is no joke, and that S Pen can be quite handy at times.
If you've made up your mind about spending more than $1,000, then I'd also suggest waiting till January 2026 to see what the Galaxy S26 Ultra offers. It's expected to be much slimmer and lighter while offering the same (and more) features as the current-gen Ultra.
 




The best for power users
If you're a heavy power user who multitasks, plays intense mobile games, travels, maybe even works outdoors, the OnePlus 15 is an option you should consider. It's a premium phone that will likely come in at an affordable price.
 




Still the best for productivity
The Galaxy S25 Ultra will soon be replaced with the S26 Ultra in early 2026, but it's still a great buy if you can find a good deal on it. You're getting great performance, battery life, cameras, and a handy stylus.

86,2025-11-07,"Both Moto G 2026 phones keep things affordable, but only one gives you a little extra bang for your buck. 

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

 




Big features, tiny price
The Moto G 2026 is the company's latest entrant in the budget smartphone market. It features a 6.7-inch HD+ display with a 120Hz refresh rate and is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 6300 chipset. It has dual rear cameras, a 5200mAh battery with 30W fast charging support, and comes in two attractive colors. 
 




Unbeatable value in your pocket
The Moto G Play 2026 starts at an even more impressive price point but retains key features from the Moto G 2026, including the large display and IP52 dust and water resistance. It also has the same 5200mAh battery but offers slightly slower charging and a less capable camera setup.
Despite the hype surrounding flagship smartphones launched in 2025 so far, and some of the upcoming ones too (looking at you, OnePlus 15), a significant market remains for budget Android phones. While there have been new additions to this segment, such as the Nuu B40 5G, which ships with a secondary OLED display on the back that not even flagship Android phones offer, Samsung and Motorola continue to dominate this space.
With Black Friday and the holiday season approaching, more people are looking to upgrade their phones this fall, and just in time, Motorola has introduced the new Moto G 2026 and Moto G Play 2026. Both smartphones continue to follow budget-friendly traits established previously, while incorporating new features to meet the expectations of users in 2025.
If you've been wondering about the key differences between these two Moto G smartphones and which one suits you better, let's see how they compare.
Motorola unveiled the new Moto G smartphones on November 4, 2025. Similar to the previous Moto G series phones, these models target the budget segment for users seeking the best value for their money.
The Moto G 2026 is the pricier of the two, starting at $200 in the U.S. It comes with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. There's no higher storage option, but it's available in two beautiful Pantone colors: Slipstream and Cattleya Orchid. The phone isn't available for purchase right away, with sales in North America beginning on December 11, 2025.
The Moto G Play 2026, on the other hand, is the more affordable of the two and costs just $170. It will be available sooner, starting November 13, 2025, through Motorola's online store, other online retailers, and carrier outlets. The Moto G Play 2026 offers 64GB of onboard storage and, unlike its pricier sibling, comes in only one color: Pantone Tapestry.
 



Motorola has settled into a consistent design language for its budget phones, and the new Moto G models are no exception. Both the Moto G 2026 and Moto G Play 2026 feature a similar design, characterized by a plain back, a slightly raised camera module that blends seamlessly into the rear panel, and the Motorola 'M' dimple in the center.
Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android
Design-wise, both smartphones appear nearly identical and share the same materials, including an eco-leather back and a plastic frame. They even share the same dimensions of 167.15 x 76.40 x 8.44 mm and weight of 202g. Both phones also have the same button placement with volume rocks and a power button on the right side of the phones, and a USB-C port and a headphone jack at the bottom.
 



While the camera module may appear to house a triple-camera setup with a flash, the actual camera hardware differs between the two devices, but more on that later.
Overall, there are a few design differences, except for color options. The Moto G 2026 comes in a vibrant purple hue and a light bluish tone, while the Moto G Play 2026 is available only in a muted blue variant.
Although the design may seem a little plain and uninspiring, Motorola has prioritized practicality by equipping both phones with an IP52 dust and water resistance rating. While it's no match for the IP68 rating found on modern flagships, it's still reassuring to know your phone can handle light rain and splashes.
 



Moving to the front, both phones are similar here, too. Both Moto G models feature a 6.7-inch LCD display with HD+ resolution and up to a 120Hz refresh rate. The screens reach up to 1,000 nits of peak brightness, which, while not extreme, should ensure good outdoor visibility.
For protection, Motorola has used Gorilla Glass 3, which, although not as tough as the Gorilla Glass Victus 2 used in many modern high-end phones, is reasonable for the price.
 



Moto G smartphones have never been known for top-tier processors, and the same applies here. Both the Moto G 2026 and Moto G Play 2026 ship with the MediaTek Dimensity 6300 chipset. For those unaware, the Dimensity 6300 is an octa-core processor featuring two Cortex-A76 cores clocked at 2.4 GHz and six Cortex-A55 cores at 2 GHz. The chipset is manufactured by TSMC using a 6nm process and is approximately a year old at this point. Graphics are handled by the Mali-G57 MP2 GPU.
It's not a high-end chipset that will blow you away, but it should handle daily tasks just fine. What's good, however, is that it brings 5G support to the Moto G Play series for the first time.
Motorola has used this chipset before in the Moto G Power 2025, and if things remain similar on the software side, performance should not ""be as big of an issue as one might think,"" in the words of our own Derrek Lee.
Speaking of software, both the Moto G 2026 and Moto G Play 2026 come with Android 16 pre-installed. Motorola includes familiar features like Moto Secure, Family Space, and Gestures, while also including some AI tools such as Google Gemini and Circle to Search.
Motorola is promising two OS upgrades and three years of security updates for the devices, which should arrive simultaneously since both phones share nearly identical hardware.

In terms of other internals, both models offer 4GB of RAM, which is expandable up to 12GB via the RAM Boost software feature. The main difference lies in storage: the extra $30 for the Moto G 2026 gets you 128GB of internal storage, while the Moto G Play comes with just 64GB. Both phones support microSD expansion up to 1TB, which should be plenty for most of your apps, photos, games, and videos.
When it comes to battery life and charging, both models feature a 5,200mAh cell, with Motorola claiming up to two days on a single charge.
The difference is in charging speed: the Moto G 2026 supports 30W USB-C fast charging, while the Moto G Play caps at 18W. This could result in noticeable differences in real-world use, but we'll need more testing to confirm. Neither phone supports wireless charging.
 



Moving on to the camera setup, this is one of the main differences between the two Moto G models. The pricier Moto G 2026 features a dual-camera system with a 50MP primary sensor (f/1.8 aperture, PDAF) paired with a 2MP macro sensor (f/2.5 aperture).
On the Moto G Play 2026, you only get a single 32MP rear sensor with an f/2.2 aperture, though it thankfully includes PDAF. The difference extends to the front cameras as well, as the Moto G 2026 sports a 32MP selfie shooter while the Moto G Play offers just an 8MP sensor.
Motorola promises ""stunning results with minimal effort"" from both phones, thanks to new AI enhancements, but we'll need to test both devices further to see how they perform in real-world conditions.
 



All things considered, the new Moto G 2026 and Moto G Play 2026 are more alike than different. However, Motorola has introduced small but meaningful differences that make a noticeable impact in daily use.
The Moto G 2026 is designed for users seeking a higher level of polish and versatility in the budget segment, featuring slightly faster charging speeds, increased internal storage, and improved front and rear cameras. Meanwhile, the Moto G Play 2026 keeps things simple and affordable while still delivering a similar experience with the same battery and processor at a lower price.
Ultimately, if you're tight on budget, the Moto G Play 2026 will cover all your needs, but if you can stretch a little, the extra features on the Moto G 2026 make it worth the price difference.
 




Budget smartphone done right
For $200, the Moto G 2026 offers excellent features for the price. You get a fast and capable processor, a large OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, and Motorola's promise of all-day battery life with fast charging that rivals what you find on flagship phones today.
 




Affordable without compromise
For those seeking a simple, no-nonsense affordable phone, the Moto G Play 2026 delivers more than enough. It has the same processor, battery, and display as its pricier sibling, along with a capable rear camera and the same IP52 dust and water resistance.

89,2025-11-07,"Indian Railways goods train tracking, Indian Railways AI technology: Indian Railways is planning to install Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based technology to enhance the safety of freight trains. The move also aims at addressing the operational challenges in detecting unlocked or tampered doors in moving freight stock, which pose significant safety and security concerns.
This new AI-based Locking Monitoring System ‘DRISHTI’ will reduce the traditionally manual checks which are not only time-consuming but also impractical for long-haul rakes under dynamic conditions. The prototype system has already been developed and has been under successful trial for the past ten months approximately on selected wagons.
This new technology is being developed through a collaborative initiative between the Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) and Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati Technology Innovation and Development Foundation (IITG TIDF).
It identified the need for an intelligent, real-time monitoring solution that could autonomously detect and alert for anomalies in door locking mechanisms, especially during transit, using advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms.
The AI-based surveillance and locking condition monitoring system – DRISHTI is expected to bring greater transparency, visibility and technological assurance to freight security system.
“Such a system can provide real-time status updates on door lock conditions, detect abnormal events or tampering during transit and issue automated data-driven alerts without affecting normal train operations. By integrating advanced analytics and imaging technology, the system aims to strengthen wagon sealing integrity, enhance reliability and minimize human intervention,” says NFR.
It further added that the system integrates AI-powered cameras and sensors mounted on strategic points to capture and analyse door positions and locking conditions in real time.
“Preliminary results have shown encouraging accuracy levels, validating the potential of this indigenous innovation. Further refinements and scalability plans are underway for wider application across the NFR network to strengthen rolling stock safety and operational reliability,” it said.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

The Market Correction quest in Arc Raiders sounds incredibly simple. You just need to find a cache at Marano Station, a relatively small area in Buried City. How hard could that be? Well, quite hard, as chances are you weren't searching for something that looks like a bin half-buried in sand.
The good news is that Marano Station is one of the best loot spots, though you wouldn't guess it based on how quiet and unassuming the area is. So while you're picking up the Marano Station cache to complete Market Correction, why not loot a few things too?
You can find the cache behind a small metal building at the north end of Marano Station in Buried City, by the car park. It basically looks like two trash cans tied together, which isn't quite what you'd expect a cache to look like, but it is easy to spot once you know.
Once you've found the cache, simply interact with it to investigate and sabotage it to complete the Market Correction quest. You don't need to extract with an item or anything like that, so don't worry about escaping alive. Given how quiet Marano Station is, the chances of you getting ganked are slim anyway.
While you're here, it's worth checking out a great loot spot nearby. Just turn around and head up to the station itself, where you'll find a barred door. Break it open, and you will find up to four containers that oddly always have at least one purple item in them.

Expedia shares surged more than 18% Friday after the Seattle-based travel tech firm reported a blowout third quarter, fueled by double-digit growth in bookings, rising revenue and profits as CEO Ariane Gorin touted AI-driven gains and steady travel demand.
Expedia’s stock traded 18% higher shortly after opening and was at around 17% at 2 p.m. Friday following its third quarter earnings, the company’s strongest earnings in more than two years.
On Thursday, Expedia reported $4.4 billion in third-quarter revenues up from $4.1 billion, a 9% increase year-on-year, along with 12% growth in gross bookings to $30.7 billion from $27.5 billion over the same period last year.
Expedia also posted a 40% surge in net income year-on-year, while diluted earnings per share climbed 45% to $7.33 from $5.04.
Its adjusted EBITDA margin grew to 32.9%, its highest in over two years.
Expedia executives said the latest results beat expectations, fueled by higher travel demand, artificial intelligence and tighter cost control, with the fastest growth in Asia by above 20%, while CFO Scott Schenkel said higher U.S. demand and marketing efficiency lifted profitability. CEO Ariane Gorin said AI is now integrated into Expedia’s core products to enhance search, summarize reviews, and customer service. Gorin also pointed to partnerships with Google, OpenAI, and Perplexity that are gradually strengthening Expedia’s position in agentic travel search. Both Hotels.com and Vrbo, brands under the Expedia Group, returned to year-over-year growth."
93,2025-11-07,"A Brazilian hairdresser Larissa Nery, who has been making headlines in India this week after her photograph was splashed over the news in an allegation about alleged election fraud, has told the BBC she initially thought it was all a mistake. Or a prank.
But then her social media blew up and people started tagging her on Instagram.
""At first it was a few random messages. I thought they were mistaking me for someone else,"" she told the BBC. ""Then they sent me the video where my face appeared on a big screen. I thought it was AI or some joke. But then lots of people started messaging at the same time and I realised it was real.""
Nery, who lives in Belo Horizonte, capital city of southeastern Brazil's Minas Gerais state, and has never been to India, says she searched on Google to understand what was going on.
What had happened was the fallout of a press conference by Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday where he accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party BJP and the Election Commission (EC) of committing voter fraud in last year's election in Haryana state. The BJP has denied the allegations. 
Hours after the press conference, in a post on X, the Chief Electoral Officer of Haryana shared a letter they said they had sent to Gandhi in August asking him to sign an oath with the names of ineligible voters ""so that necessary proceedings could be initiated"". They did not respond to the specific allegations he made and did not comment on Nery's case. The BBC has reached out to the poll panel for response.
Gandhi has made a series of accusations of ""vote theft"" against the poll panel since early August.
In his latest claims, he said his team had looked through the Election Commission's voter list data and found that of the approximately 20 million voters, 2.5 million were irregular entries - including duplicates, bulk voters and invalid addresses. He blamed his party's loss in the Haryana election on this alleged manipulation of the voters' list.
To prove his claims, he showed a number of slides on a big screen. One of them showed Gandhi standing in front of a big image of Nery, while another showed a compilation of 22 voters with different names and addresses but all with her photos.
""Who is this lady? How old is she? She votes 22 times in Haryana,"" Gandhi said.
He explained that a single stock photo of a woman, taken by Brazilian photographer Matheus Ferrero, had been used repeatedly across multiple voter entries under different names. He described Nery as a model who had appeared on the voters' list under many names, including Seema, Sweety and Saraswati.
The 29-year-old confirmed to the BBC that it was indeed her in the photograph. ""Yes. It is me. Much younger, but it is me. I am the person in the images."" 
She clarified that she was a hairdresser and not a model and that the photo was taken in March 2017 when she was 21, just outside her home. The photographer, she said, ""thought I was pretty and asked to take photos of me"".
Now years later, all the attention in the past two days from ""people from India, many of them journalists"", has left her scared.
""I became scared. I cannot tell if it is dangerous for me or if speaking about it could harm someone there. I do not know who is right or wrong because I do not know the parties involved,"" she said.
""I did not go to work in the morning because I could not even see messages from my clients. Many journalists were calling me. They found the number of the place where I work. 
""I had to remove the salon name from my profile because they were disturbing my workplace. My boss even spoke to me. Some people treat it like a meme, but it is affecting me professionally.""
Matheus Ferrero, who took Nery's photo, is also overwhelmed by the sudden attention. Until recently, he says India meant only Caminho das Índias - the 2009 Brazilian primetime show - to him.
He's still trying to make sense of the events of the last few days in a country thousands of miles away.
Some people had reached out to him from India a week back, asking him who the woman in the photo was, he told the BBC.
""I didn't reply. I'm not going to give someone's name like that. And I hadn't seen this friend in years,"" he told the BBC. ""I thought it was a scam. I blocked and reported it.""
But since Gandhi's press conference, ""things have exploded"".
""People were calling me on Instagram and Facebook. It was terrible. I deactivated my Instagram to try to understand what was going on. Later I googled it and realised what was happening, but at first I had no idea.""
Ferrero says some websites put his pictures next to the Nery's photo without permission. ""People were making memes, like turning it into a game show joke. It's absurd.""
In 2017, Ferrero was just starting out as a photographer when he invited Nery, who he knew, to come out for a photoshoot. Ferrero said he shared the photos on his Facebook and also posted them on Unsplash - a photo website - with her consent.
""The photo blew up… reached around 57 million views,"" he said.
He has now deleted the link from his Unsplash account but he sent us screenshots taken earlier that showed other photos of Nery from the same shoot.
""I deleted them out of fear, because the photos were being misused. I got scared imagining this happening to other people I photographed. I felt invaded. A lot of random people coming at me. You think 'Did I do something wrong?' But I didn't. The platform was open and I uploaded like millions of others."" He's also now made the original Facebook post with her photos private.
""When you see people entering your Twitter, Facebook, personal Instagram, you panic. The first reaction is to shut everything down and understand later. Some people thought it was funny, like a soap opera, but I felt invaded.""
Neither Ferrero nor Nery have ever been to India and are still trying to understand how something that happened at the other end of the world could turn their lives upside down.
We asked Ferrero if all this helped uncover electoral fraud, would that be positive?
""Yes, I think that would be positive. But I don't really know the details,"" he said.
Nery who has never left the country says: ""This is far from my reality. I do not even follow elections in Brazil, let alone in another country.""

Tesla shares declined more than 3% on Friday, cutting CEO Elon Musk’s fortune by $10 billion after the automaker voted to approve a compensation plan that could award the world’s richest person $1 trillion over the next decade—a move derided by some analysts and shareholders. 
Shares of Tesla fell 3.6% to around $429.70 as of Friday afternoon, continuing a two-day losing streak after the stock fell 3.5% on Thursday in the lead-up to Tesla’s shareholder vote.
More than 75% of Tesla shareholders voted Thursday in favor of the payment package for Musk, following opposition from some of the automaker’s largest equity holders.
The compensation deal awards Musk more than 423 million additional shares, raising his equity to roughly 25%, if Tesla achieves several goals over the next decade, some of which include Tesla’s market capitalization increasing to $8.5 trillion and Tesla selling 12 million more cars, among others.
Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, told Reuters the $1 trillion deal is “outrageous” and Tesla’s milestone goals are “Everest-sized,” but noted Musk would earn “nothing unless he creates staggering value” and “pulls off the unimaginable.”
AJ Bell’s investment director Russ Mould wrote Friday there are “logical reasons” the shareholder vote passed, given the lofty goals set for Tesla, while WedBush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote there was “little to lose” for most shareholders in approving the deal, which Ives said solidified Musk as a “wartime CEO.”
Some shareholders opposed the vote: New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, who oversees Tesla shares held by the city’s pension, accused Tesla’s “crony board” of awarding the “ransom Musk wanted and now shareholders are on the hook for an indefensible compensation package.”
Musk remains the world’s wealthiest person with a net worth estimated at $481.4 billion, following a drop of $10 billion (2%) on Tesla’s stock decline. He became the first person to be worth $500 billion and, before that, $400 billion earlier this year, as Tesla’s stock surge has propelled him further ahead of No. 2 Larry Ellison ($289.7 billion), whose net worth briefly approached Musk’s fortune after Oracle’s meteoric rise in September. Other losses were recorded among the world’s richest people, including Ellison, whose net worth fell $9.1 billion, in addition to declines for No. 3 Jeff Bezos (down $2 billion), No. 4 Larry Page ($5.6 billion), No. 5 Sergey Brin ($5.2 billion) and No. 6 Mark Zuckerberg ($2.6 billion)."

	UK network ITV has confirmed it is in talks with Comcast over a shock £1.6B ($2.1B) sale of its Media & Entertainment business.

News of the potential deal emerged out of the blue overnight, with Comcast hoping to add the main ITV network, its suite of linear channels and the ITVX streaming business to its roster. Comcast bought UK pay-TV giant Sky in 2018 for around £30B.

	In a statement to the stock exchange this morning, ITV said it “notes the recent press speculation and confirms that it is in preliminary discussions regarding a possible sale of its M&E business to Sky for an enterprise value of £1.6B.  

	










	“There can be no certainty as to the terms upon which any potential sale may be agreed or whether any transaction will take place. A further announcement will be made in due course if appropriate.”

	A deal would form a hugely powerful UK broadcasting business, as Comcast already owns Sky and a suite of production companies, such as Day of the Jackal maker Carnival through NBCUniversal. Notably, the statement points to Sky as the buyer, not its parent.

	We understand Comcast isn’t the only major U.S. studio to have explored a deal for ITV’s broadcasting arm, which yesterday warned it was seeking to make additional cost savings of £35M at the M&E business amid a “softening” British economy. The TV advertising downturn has hurt all of Europe’s major commercial broadcasters and most have looked to new revenue streams to hold up their value. 

	ITV’s production and sales wing, ITV Studios, which makes and sells the likes of Love Island and Line of Duty around the world, has been the subject of its own takeover talk, with the likes of All3Media parent RedBird IMI and Banijay among those known to have kicked the tyres. 

	It has therefore come as a surprise that it is in fact the channels business that appears closer to sale. ITV rival Channel 5 is already owned by a U.S. behemoth, Paramount-Skydance, although rumors over a sale of Channel 5 in the Skydance regime abound. Its other rival, Channel 4, has a completely different ownership structure. 

	










	Revenue in the networks biz fell by 5% to £1.44B over the first nine months of this year, according to yesterday’s trading update.

	Any deal would need to worm its way through the competition regulator. Media analyst Ian Whittaker told the BBC that a combination of Sky and ITV would mean the pair had “70% plus” of the UK TV advertising market, which he said “in normal circumstances” would be rejected by regulators because of the dominance it would give them. But Peter Bazalgette, a former ITV chairman, called on regulators to be flexible given that ITV is now taking on the likes of Google and Meta in the video advertising space.

	ITV’s notoriously sticky share price shot up by 18% to 80p per share this morning, its highest figure for several weeks. This had been steadily declining since September. The network’s share price has been the subject of constant discussion over the years and any sale would unlock some value for disgruntled shareholders.

Bitcoin hovered around $101,000 as the Friday trading day began in Hong Kong, as on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant warned that market conditions have turned “extremely bearish.”
In its latest weekly report, CryptoQuant said Bitcoin’s drop under the 365-day moving average of $102,000 marked the loss of a key technical and psychological support that previously defined the bottom of this bull cycle. The firm’s Bull Score Index — a composite measure of market strength — has fallen to zero for the first time since June 2022, a signal last seen before the previous bear market.
CryptoQuant added that traders’ on-chain realized price bands now point to potential downside targets near $72,000 if BTC fails to recover above $100,000 soon.
It also identified the $91,000 region, based on Metcalfe’s network valuation model, as the next structural support level. “Failure to reclaim the 365-day moving average quickly could trigger a much larger correction,” the firm said.
The report follows weeks of weakening fundamentals, including falling inflows, reduced network activity, and a flattening of key on-chain valuation metrics. CryptoQuant analysts said the setup now resembles late 2021, when a similar break below the long-term average confirmed the start of a prolonged drawdown.
Still, this view is not universal.
In a report from earlier this week titled “Defending $100K,” Glassnode wrote that the market remains “cautious, oversold, but not yet deeply capitulated,” with 71% of supply still in profit and unrealized losses contained to just 3.1% of market cap.
While long-term holders are selling and ETF outflows continue, Glassnode says the current phase is a mid-cycle correction rather than the start of a bear market.
BTC: Bitcoin slipped as low as $100,420 overnight before recovering slightly to trade around $101,000 in Asia hours, extending a weeklong decline that’s wiped nearly 7% from its value.
ETH: Ether fell to an intraday low of $3,285 before edging back to $3,310 in early Asia trading, down about 2% on the day and roughly 13% over the past week.
Gold: Gold rebounded toward the $4,000 level on Wednesday, rising as much as 1.5% to $3,989.53 an ounce as investors sought safety amid a global equities sell-off, even as strong U.S. jobs data tempered expectations for further Fed rate cuts.
Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets opened lower Friday, tracking Wall Street’s tech-led sell-off as AI stocks like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Palantir slumped, while investors awaited China’s trade data expected to show weaker exports and imports.
