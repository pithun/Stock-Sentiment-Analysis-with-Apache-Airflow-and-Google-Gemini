We've tested a ton of backpacking water filters. I like some better than others; like WIRED reviewer Scott Gilbertson, I found the MSR AutoFlow XL gravity filter ($130) to be a game-changer when backcountry camping with my family. It made filtering large quantities of water for cooking and refilling water bottles so much easier than our normal routine of sitting on a rock hand pumping the MSR Guardian ($253, $137 off) for an hour.
I also took the Grayl GeoPress ($80, $20 off) on a trip to the Philippines because it's fast and filters into its own water bottle to pour into cups for doing things like brushing your teeth. However, for whatever reason, the LifeStraw personal water filter has an absolute chokehold on WIRED readers. This weekend, it's again $10 off.

This isn't the best water filter, and it isn't even the best LifeStraw. In my opinion, that would be the light, convenient squeeze bag, the LifeStraw Peak Series ($32), which you can use to scoop up water so you're not, like, actually putting your face down into a puddle. I also like the LifeStraw Go Series ($34, $16 off). I use the Grayl now, but for years I carried a LifeStraw Go bottle when my family travels to places like the American South, where my kids refuse to drink tap water.
I get it, though. The very first LifeStraw is cheap, light, and perfect for sticking in an emergency kit. I do have one now, thanks to you guys, and I keep it in my backpack when I'm hiking with my kids, even when I'm also carrying water bottles. It sucks to be thirsty! Check out our video on how to use it below. And yes, my pants were cold and wet for the rest of the day.

Bose surprised shoppers who thought Black Friday deals were over by dropping the price of its QuietComfort noise cancelling headphones to an all-time low on Cyber Monday, and this makes it much easier to choose between Sony, Sonos or Apple models. These headphones are now $199 on Amazon, down from their usual price of $349 which is a record-breaking 43% discount that makes premium noise cancellation available at a mid-tier price.
See at Amazon
Bose designed these headphones with cutting-edge noise-canceling technology that uses both active electronic canceling and passive physical isolation from the over-ear design, and it makes a quiet bubble even in loud places like airplane cabins or busy coffee shops. The system listens to background noise thousands of times per second and makes sound waves that are exactly opposite to the noise coming in, so it cancels it out before it reaches your ears.
Aware mode changes things up by using external microphones to send sounds from the outside world into your ears: This lets you hear announcements, conversations or traffic without taking off your headphones. You can talk to people while wearing the headphones in this transparency mode, but voices sound a little different than when you hear them directly. You can also switch between modes with the push of a button, so you can do it right away when a flight attendant comes up to you or when you need to cross the street safely.
The audio quality has the warm, bass-heavy sound that Bose fans loveÂ with deep lows that make kick drums and basslines sound heavier without drowning out vocals or high-frequency details. You can change the bass, mid-range and treble levels in the Bose Music app to fit your preferences or make up for how you hear things. This changes the sound profile from bass-heavy to balanced or treble-focused, depending on what you like.
The soft memory foam and synthetic protein leather that make up the plush over-ear cushions feel good against your skin and make a good seal without putting too much pressure on your head. The padded headband spreads the weight evenly across the top of your head and stop the pressure points that make you uncomfortable after wearing them for hours at a time. These headphones are comfortable enough for long flights or full workdays without making your ears tired or giving you headaches.
With noise cancellation on, the battery can last up to 24 hours on a single charge which means you can go for days without needing to charge it again, even on long international flights. With USB-C quick charging, you can listen for 2.5 hours after just 15 minutes of charging, which is great if you forget to charge it overnight. When Bluetooth isn’t available or the battery runs out, the included audio cable with an inline microphone turns these into wired headphones.
Right now, you can get these QuietComfort headphones for $199 instead of $349, which is $150 less than the usual price for noise-canceling technology. You’re getting Bose’s best ANC performance, a battery life of 24 hours, comfortable all-day wear, and better sound quality for less than what Sony’s WH-1000XM4 usually costs on sale.

The first handbag Sarah Davis ever sold was a Louis Vuitton red Epi bucket bag. As a law student looking to make money, she'd bought it at a DC thrift store in 1999 for $250 and flipped it on eBay. She used the proceeds to buy two more and do the same.
While she ditched eBay and outsourced procurement, she's essentially doing the same thing 25 years later as the founder of Fashionphile, a secondhand luxury platform. Over the past 25 years, the company said it has sold 2 million accessories — including several Louis Vuitton red Epi bucket bags.
The company expects to sell more than $500 million worth of products this year and is profitable, it said.
Fashionphile's rise has coincided with a surge in the luxury resale market.
The secondhand fashion and luxury market is expected to grow two to three times as fast as the firsthand luxury market over the next two years and reach $317 billion globally by 2027, according to a November report from McKinsey.
Affordability and accessibility are driving the growth.
""There was a day that there were two real, in my opinion, entry points to luxury,"" Davis said: Coach and counterfeits. ""Now they don't have to do either. They can come straight to us.""
As secondhand becomes second nature, consumers are shopping with resale in mind.
Luxury watches, jewelry, and bags — all of which Fashionphile sells — are popular investment pieces, the McKinsey report said. They tend to hold their value and can sell for more on the secondhand market than they do on the primary one.
Davis buys into the model. One of her favorite bags is a mini Chanel flap bag that she's had for more than a decade. She bought it used, of course, and plans to resell it soon, only because her new phone can't fit.
""I could sell it for thousands more, even in the shape it's in,"" Davis said.
As the ultimate handbag reseller, Davis shared three tips for shopping and selling handbags on the secondhand luxury market.
If you're looking for resale value, stick to signature styles.
Fashionphile's No. 1 selling bag this year is the Louis Vuitton Speedy. The Chanel Double Flap and Hermès Evelyne are also hits.
""We sell, every day, dozens of the classics,"" Davis said. ""They get on the site; they move very quickly.""
These bags are never on sale, and their prices increase every year. That means if you wait it out long enough — and treat your bag well enough — there will be a payday.
""You take that Louis Vuitton bag, keep it for a few years, you will be able to sell it for more than you bought it for,"" she said. ""It's kind of like buying a house; you sell that, get more money, build your way up to your Birkin.""
Like classic styles, classic colors hold their value the best.
""Black is always a go,"" Davis said.
Brown — ranging from taupe to caramel to chocolate — is Fashionphile's second most popular color.
Unlike other colors, which can trend in and out, these neutral tones are timeless, which means you can resell an item in one of these hues next year or in 10 years.
Getting the best deal, whether or not you're planning to resell, takes work, Davis said.
""There are so many bargains to be had — 70%, 80% off retail — if you're willing to do the search,"" she said.
Fashionphile has tens of thousands of items available at any given moment. Most users, she said, won't go through them all, focusing instead on new arrivals or the most popular styles.
Some of the best deals are on items that are a slight variation of the classic. A navy Chanel bag will sell for less than a black one, for example, and a more obscure shape Louis Vuitton will sell for less than a Speedy.
""There are some funky little styles, and you take a little bit of color, you're going to get an incredible deal,"" she said.

Dyson still sells older models like the V8 that launched nearly a decade ago, but if you want cleaning power that really removes embedded dirt from carpets, you need something more recent with stronger suction and better brush technology. The newest Gen5 models cost around $1,000 which feels excessive for a vacuum regardless of how good it performs so finding middle ground makes sense for most households.
The Dyson V11 Origin hits that sweet spot with powerful suction and modern features without the premium flagship pricing and Amazon just dropped it to $399 for Cyber Monday weekend, down from the usual $629. This marks a record low for post-Black Friday clearance and offers 37% off one of Dyson’s most capable cordless vacuums.
See at Amazon
The Dyson V11 has 185 air watts of suction power which is 60% more than earlier V-series models, and it has enough power to pull dirt that is stuck in carpet fibers that other cordless vacuums leave behind. The motorbar cleaner head has a motorized brush bar with anti-tangle technology that actively removes hair that has gotten stuck in it while you clean. This means you won’t have to cut hair off the roller every few days which is a pain, and it is very important if you have pets or long hair in the house because regular brush bars turn into useless tangles of hair after a week of use.
You can choose between three power modes to control the balance between suction strength and runtime. Auto mode automatically changes the power level based on the type of floor and the amount of dirt, giving you the best cleaning while using the least amount of battery power for everyday tasks. By lowering suction, Eco mode can extend runtime by up to 60 minutes which is great for quick touch-ups or cleaning big areas with light dirt. When you have to clean up a lot of tracked-in mud or pet accidents, boost mode gives you the most suction for about five minutes. The LCD screen shows the current power mode, how much time is left until the battery runs out (down to the second), maintenance alerts when the filters need to be cleaned and blockage alerts when something blocks the system.
The hair screw tool has a conical brush bar that is made to spiral long hair and pet hair into the collection bin without getting tangled: It makes it very useful for cleaning upholstery, stairs, and car interiors where pet hair gets stuck deep down. The crevice tool can get into tight spaces between cushions and along baseboards. The mini soft dusting brush, on the other hand, is great for cleaning delicate surfaces like lampshades and keyboards. In just a few seconds, you can also switch to handheld mode by taking off the wand.
Advanced whole-machine filtration catches 99.99% of particles as small as 0.3 microns and keeps allergens, dust mites, and pet dander inside the sealed system instead of letting them back into the air. People with allergies will benefit greatly from this HEPA-level filtration because the air that comes out is cleaner than the air in most homes. The bagless design lets you empty the bin with just one button press which ejects dirt without you having to touch it.
The lithium-ion battery keeps the suction strong as it drains, unlike older nickel-based batteries which lose power slowly over time. The docking station that hangs on the wall charges the vacuum and keeps the tools that come with it close at hand so everything is organized and ready for quick cleanups. And it takes about 4.5 hours to charge from empty to fullÂ and you can still take the battery out if you want to buy a spare for long cleaning sessions.
Instead of paying $629 for the V11 Origin, you can get it for $399 and it saves you $230 on a vacuum that usually stays at a high price because it is Dyson’s best-selling model between entry-level and flagship levels. This is your last chance to get premium Dyson performance before stock runs out and prices go back up.

8,2025-11-30,"A man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after four people were injured in a town centre.
The attack, which took place on Railway Street, Altrincham, at about 03:20 GMT, saw a 21-year-old man suffer wounds to his chest, Greater Manchester Police said. He was taken to hospital where he is in a serious but stable condition.
Another man in his 20s had ""life-changing"" injuries to his face, the force said, while a 51-year old man and a woman, 52, also received minor injuries.
A 24-year-old man, from Partington, has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and assault. He remains in custody for questioning.
Det Ch Insp Matthew Dixon said the attack was an ""isolated"" incident, adding: ""We are appealing to anyone in the area to come forward who may have witnessed an altercation on Railway Street, before a white male in his 20s ran down the street towards Altrincham Interchange.
""We appreciate the concern that communities may feel during an incident of this nature.""
He said police would remain in the town centre to conduct inquiries and thanked businesses for their cooperation.

10,2025-11-30,"Finding a good car on the cheap these days is like the proverbial needle in a haystack. There's no shortage of cars on the market — used and new — but the price tags can be well north of the average consumer's budget. Inflation is also casting a shadow over spending; the economic climate is forcing prospective car owners to recalibrate the definition of affordability.
Maintenance and repair costs are on the rise, auto insurance is through the roof in some states, and, generally speaking, cars are more expensive to drive off a dealer's lot than ever before. The average new car burned a $50,080 hole in buyers' pockets in September — up from $48,000 in 2023 and far above pre-pandemic levels. For these reasons, more American drivers have turned to the used car market to get a better bang for their buck.
Even with this development, the average used car costs just over $31,000, and they aren't getting cheaper. So, the question is, are there still good cars out there at bargain prices? If SUVs tickle your fancy, you're in luck. We're exploring five of the best SUVs on sale for less than $30,000 as listed in JD Power's ""Best SUVs Under $30K"" as of October 20, 2025. We also provide helpful information and insight about each vehicle.
Buicks are known for their pocket-friendly and reliable nature, and that hasn't changed even with rising MSRPs across the board. That's particularly surprising in the case of the 2025 Buick Envista. Sporty-looking SUVs don't usually sell cheaply, but the base trim of the Envista starts at around $25,000, and the priciest comes in at just under 30 grand.
It's natural to wonder what the catch is with such low prices, and in the Envista's case, you shouldn't judge a book by its cover. While its aesthetic may subconsciously lead you to draw performance parallels to the likes of Lexus, that's where the sportiness ends. It's powered by a 1.2-liter three-cylinder engine that makes 137 hp. That translates to a 0-60mph time of 9.3 seconds — a mark that won't impress anyone looking for a racing thrill.
There's a noticeable delay when you step on the gas, so maneuvers like overtaking can feel far more calculated than necessary. However, what the Buick Envista lacks in speed and performance, it makes up for in comfort. The interior material feel isn't going to turn any heads, but it doesn't feel cheap despite the smattering of black plastics.
In terms of human fit, it doesn't compromise headroom, although the roofline slants low. The cabin is on the roomy side, and the only notable discomfort is the lack of adjustability for its seatbelt – things can get a little restrictive for drivers.
Built as Chevrolet's competitive entry into the subcompact crossover market, the TrailBlazer's main selling point, besides its accessible price point, is its firepower. The TrailBlazer sports a 155-hp engine and has an AWD option. That opens up more room for sporty drivers to play around, and there's some potential for off-roading too. However, the relaxed acceleration can be a minor drawback in this regard, as going from 0-60 mph takes a leisurely 8.7 seconds. Its handling also leaves a bit to be desired, but the steering is firm, and it runs comfortably at both cruising and highway speeds.
Where the TrailBlazer really shines is in its styling, especially that of the interior. The seating is slightly elevated; you'd expect this sort of ride height in larger SUVs, but it eases entry for drivers of all heights — you won't have to contort your body if you're on the taller side. The legroom is ample at the rear, and like the Buick Envista, the slanted roofline doesn't eat too much headroom.
The cargo space is Chevrolet's trump card. There are 25.3 cubic feet for hauling with the seats up, which expands to well over 50 by folding the rear seats. The TrailBlazer's base model goes for an MSRP of $24,495. SlashGear reviewed the 2025 Chevrolet TrailBlazer favorably and owners gave broadly positive feedback, too.
The second Buick on this list, the 2025 Encore GX, plays in the subcompact SUV field. That category has multiple big brand players like Audi and BMW, so the Encore GX's base price point of $27,335 should put it on the map for buyers with a tight budget. However, a discount alone wouldn't be enough to convince consumers shopping in this car genre; it's the subtle brushes with luxury that count.
That's where the Encore GX puts in most of its perk points — interior styling, amenities, and overall design. The level of its detailing may not rival an upper echelon brand for luxury, but its mostly leather lining more than holds its own compared to the mainstream competition. However, performance and fuel economy are modest. The base model's 1.2-liter engine delivers 137 hp, and the optional 1.3-liter produces 155. The latter figure may sound adequate, but 0-60 takes 8.8 seconds, although the Encore GX feels springier than the distinctly average mark suggests.
In terms of fuel economy, one would expect the engines to sip fuel, considering their lack of firepower. However, the front-wheel-drive models post metrics of 30 mpg combined, while AWD falls to 27, although you could eke out more mileage by using AWD mode only where you need the traction.
The 2025 Subaru Crosstrek came with more powerful engines in every trim except the base model, which uses a 2.0-liter engine producing 152 ponies. All other versions of the Crosstrek feature the 2.5-liter, 182 hp pulse that's more up the alley of drivers who prefer to rev their engines to full power once in a while — on paper, at least. In reality, 0-60 mph acceleration takes the base trim over 9 seconds, which is rather sleepy in any interpretation. The 182 hp version fares slightly better at 7.9.
That additional horsepower means the Crosstrek can go off-road in addition to city runs and highway trips. It also features 8.7 inches of ground clearance (up to 9.3 inches in the Wilderness trim) that bolsters its ascent and descent capabilities.
While the performance features are worth a second look, if you're big on comfort and expressive detailing, the Subaru Crosstrek may take some getting used to. The design is utilitarian; lower-level trims use cloth cushioning for their seats, and the infotainment system has a dated look to its menus. Subaru tends to keep things simple in the tech department, and the Crosstek isn't deviating from that aesthetic — despite the slow response times from the car system. The Subaru Crosstrek base model has an MSRP of $27,980.
Compared to all other vehicles on this list, the Chevrolet Trax has the lowest entry MSRP. It's the cheapest model Chevrolet produces; the base model starts at $21,895, and the price scales to only $25,895 with all options loaded. Within this pocket-friendly range, it's expected that the Chevrolet Trax will have been engineered with quite a few compromises.
The first of those compromises is the engine, which is a turbocharged inline-three producing a modest 137 hp that hits 60 in 8.8 seconds. There's just enough power to avoid lethargy during a town cruise, but you'll need to put the pedal to the metal for mundane overtaking on the highway. SlashGear has covered a handful of the most important drawbacks, including its lack of an AWD option. 
However, the Trax compensates for a lack of firepower with features and cargo design. Although the exterior makes the Trax look small, the long wheelbase provides substantial space. This means there's more legroom for passengers and increased cargo space. 
The major selling point, besides price, is the SUV's features. Heated front seats, basic driver aids like automatic high-beams, and cruise control in the higher-end models add to riding comfort. Although it lacks an in-built navigation system, the Trax's multiple driving assist features should suffice for most needs. "

Mod parent funny and file it in the set of sets that do not contain themselves.
It is not ""others platforms we have identified"", it is ""unknown"". It can be BSD, but it can also be a bot, someone running anti-fingerprinting extensions, a mobile browser in desktop mode, some embedded system, etc... Anything that doesn't match their rules. There is probably a higher proportion of Linux users than Windows or Apple users in there because Linux users are more likely to have a weird setup, but I wouldn't count on it.
I know we're a smaller chunk of the pie, but I do actively run FreeBSD on a number of desktops, workstations, and laptops here at home, of both the x86/AMD64 and ARM/Aarch64 variety. Because FreeBSD lives in the world that Linux did a while back, a fuckton of us fake our user agents because shit ass web devs STILL put hard checks into their code that says ""your OS isn't supported on our site, therefor you cannot browse it"" even though the OS makes fuck all difference inside of a web browser.
And isn't Apple based on BSD these days?
If by ""these days"" you mean ""for the last 20 years"", then it is.
Correct. User Agent set to ""flip off"" or similar.
>""If we are adding in FreeBSD, Android etc, might as well also add in MacOS.  They are all quite similar from a user point of view and all based off one or the other NIXes""
Not really.  It isn't free, much of it isn't open, doesn't use X11 or Wayland, doesn't use any of the Linux desktop environments, and it really only runs on Apple hardware.  Very different in many ways from Linux or BSD.
Although I think that throwing ""unknown"" and ""BSD"" into the Linux count is not valid.

desktop devices?
There's always been a clear distinction between mobile and desktop computing.Just counting all mobile Linux usage as desktop all of a sudden to make you feel better about it doesn't actually change the real numbers.The fact remains that on /desktop/ devices--that is computers that sit on a /desk/ using a mouse and keyboard as input Linux still lags very far behind Windows and even Apple. Counting laptops among that probably lowers the Linux number even more.
Mobile devices can arguably be counted among embedded devices--specialty devices that have tightly curated operating systems and software environments--and here Linux has a very strong presence.
Hand-held phones you put in your pocket typically aren't desktop devices, but many VoIP desk phones used in businesses are.  Some may even run Linux (I haven't checked).
Not all desktop devices use a mouse or keyboard.
That said, the total number of desktop phones running Linux is probably small enough to be considered noise, at least for now.  But in a few years, who knows?
My tablet is usually used on my desktop. But a laptop is clearly not designed for a desktop, hence the name.My favorite desktop device is a pad of paper and pencil. I even have a pencil sharpener to go with it on my desktop.
I distinctly remember people recommending use of a tablet with external keyboard as a substitute for entry-level subnotebook computers when the latter were discontinued in fourth quarter 2012 [slashdot.org]. This despite that major tablets ship with operating systems locked down not to run the sort of lightweight software development environments that could run on the desktop operating system of a netbook.
Lots of people use phones as their ""desktop.""
Technically, phones and tablets are not desktops, or laptops, but lots of people use phones, or tablets, as their primary, or only, computer device.
I'm using Instapaper on my Kobo.
Via a Firefox plugin, naturally. No cross device downloading service needs to be a core component of a browser.
These stats are collected by checking the OS through the browser.Quite a few browsers out there spoof the OS to Windows for compatibility reasons.
That alone is causing the Linux numbers to be massively under represented.
Yep. I had to do that manually a while ago because some crappy websites simply could not deal. I guess browsers do that by default now.

Of fake Linux on the desktop statistics.
From self-checkouts running Linux...Yes, but TFA was a bout Linux desktop systems. I assume that means your typical laptop/deskside computers, not phones, tablets, embedded systems, or rack-mounted datacenter gear.I spend most of my time in a WSL environment on my Windows laptop. I wonder how that would count.

It's not very feasible to try and count Linux use, linuxcounter.org
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/... [wikipedia.org]
The project closed because people stopped, there's a way forward with game compatibility via proton. Most of the web is usable now. Is it worth debating now as there's good parity between them and moving is simple enough.
But if you think about Linux as an OS (what some would call GNU/Linux), you cannot include Android and ChromeOS on that list, sorry. So yeah, it's 3.5% + some of that 4.2% in the unknown, but no idea how much.
On the other hand, if your realize the GNU userspace is also on Mac, and the xBSDs, the numbers go up.
A flat percentage is really not the way to go for this. Sadly, it is the limit of what most people ""understand"".
Both use BSD (style) utilities. The BSDs because they are BSDs why should they use GNU (but you can optionally install it, of course) and Mac because Apple doesn't want their OS to be tainted by GPL to be sure they won't be obliged to share sources of any component they do not want to open source.Using GPL is the guarantee that Apple and Google keep their fingers off your software.
Apple has a handful of GPL programs and publishes their modifications. Bash being the most obvious example.ref: https://opensource.apple.com/r... [apple.com]
Didn't they change to zsh to avoid GPLv3 bash?
I mean services like statscounter typically derive their statistics from Javascript run from ad- or tracking-servers. It is somewhat more likely that Linux (or BSD) users have something like noscript or an aggressive ad-blocker installed.Then of course there is the point that many, if not most, Windows installations never load a webpage from the Internet. There is a huge chunk of people who use Windows for specialized applications without Internet access. It's a legacy platform.
Yeah, and Android is also ""Linux"" which makes is the most popular OS in the world.
Very fat sarcasm aside, Android is not Linux (aside from a forked, heavily patched, frozen version of the Linux kernel), ChromeOS is not Linux (it's an atomically (!) updated immutable (!) Linux kernel based OS distributed by Google), and SteamOS is also not Linux (see ChromeOS above), if we are talking about Linux distros containing

  * upstream kernel with minimal changes
 * glibc and other usual libraries

Indeed. Funny how people with weakly justified views often have to add cheap manipulation tricks.
Very fat sarcasm aside, Android is not Linux (aside from a forked, heavily patched, frozen version of the Linux kernel),
Android is (below that stupid UI) very much linux underneath, as any dev who has spent time hacking various android devices can tell you. (and not some social media/stackexchange opinion bot recycling safe pieces of ""common wisdom"" for likes).

Android is using the same ""linux"" technologies as any typical desktop, server or embedded implementation of linux (selinux, namespaces, dm-verity, etc).
Yeah, Android also uses glibc, systemd, xorg/wayland-something, and linux packages. Oh wait, it doesn't. There's almost nothing from the average Linux distro in Android aside from the built-in kernel features that you mentioned. Nice try though.


Oh, and it also uses the unmodified mainline kernel. Oh wait, again it doesn't. It uses its own heavily modified 
Well, we've found the Stallman zealot.  lol
Another nice insult and, sorry to break it to you, but I couldn't care less about Stallman.

Let's just focus on PC usage, leaving out Android phones and tablets, as well as Chromebooks.


If we count users as in people behind the browsers, then just for me, there's a count of about 10. Meaning 10 browsers running just for one user, me. There's a Firefox instance on my primary desktop at home (VNC session in a headless server, to be exact) and a second one in a different accou

If ifs and buts were candy and nuts then Linux would be on every desktop.
Android is basically Linux, not Desktop or full GNU/Linux but it is Linux, alright. So is ChromeOS and whatever the F aluminum is.
And with SteamOS / bazzite / etc and Proton, things are indeed looking very bright for people to make the switch - when the alternative is something horribly disgusting like win11.
Linux worked generally great on the desktop for many, many years, but with rock solid gaming support it finally filled the last gap.
I mean if you're going to count mobile, why not count any use frontend use of backend servers as well.   After all, slashdot.org is running on Linux, so you're using it now on a desktop or mobile.    We don't do this because the argument gets absurd.
Desktop generally counts desktop and laptop type computers and most of them aren't running Linux, they're running WIndows, MacOS, ChromeOS and some kind of Linux (or ""Unknown"", I suppose).   You could count ChromeOS into Linux but that still doesn't beat out Win 
... In the sense of ""a Linux-using vegan who went to Yale didn't know how to start her conversations...""
There are a lot of Linux users that don't hang out in the same bars as you. It's just like being gay, not everyone is out there and active in the community.
I see more people randomly have a Linux laptop than I saw in the past. Or people I learn are using a Linux at home. So I think there is more than I realize.But I don't think that adds up to 11% in any way. 1 in 10 would mean it's essentially everywhere. I don't see it everywhere.
This is the site that inexplicably listed Windows 11 market share dropping by some 15 million people in one month (given percentages), which resulted in applause from Slashdotters, only for the following month to add some 16million back to the market share.
The site isn't a reliable judgement of any system. There's no reason to assume Unknown = Linux, when the reality is Unknown can mean anything, including Linux and MacOS which the site constantly miscategorises.
It's a rubbish site for anything other than t 
Or, it could just be users using anonymity-hardened browsers that set User Agent to random jibberish.
Setting aside that phones and tablets are not ""desktops,"" the author counts Android and iOS as ""Linux on the desktop"" and trots out a 72% market share number. But I don't think that those who long for the Year of the Linux Desktop, would find it fulfilling that their long-sought goal was achieved not by a free, open source Linux distro, but rather, by one or more commercial, for-profit distros.
My left monitor displays my gaming laptop running Windows 11, which is easily travels with me.  My right monitor displays my desktop/media server running Linux Mint.  My go-to laptop from the couch or walking out the door is an M1 MacBook Air.  I'm excited to see Proton ported to it, since I do a lot of gaming on a Steam Deck, which also gets docked to my TV.

Oracle has definitely gone downhill for a long time. They should have been sticking to what they really were good at - databases and tools for accessing them.
The downward slope started somewhere around version 8.1 when they decided to add Java to the database.
I talked to a DB expert at a really large bank about 15 years ago. Apparently, at that time Oracle was already not ""good"" at databases.
My experience was like 30 years ago, that's how long ago that they were decent.
Of course any database requires a good DBA and good SQL programmers for optimal results regardless of who has made the database.
Indeed. Also shows that giants die slowly, unfortunately.
Just look at IBM, they are still alive. I think that they survives by providing services to banks and some of the Fortune 500 companies.
Microsoft shows all the signs of going the same path. Same with VMware.
Well, IBM was basically a zombie 10 years ago. Something will have to  stake them to put them out of their misery. Fully agree on Microsoft. Their stuff is only getting worse at this time and was pretty bad before. And their cloud got hacked several times now and had really, really bad vulnerabilities were nobody knows whether they were attacked or not (which makes things worse). They clearly do not have what it takes to survive with the increased need for IT security we have today.
I think this will turn out to be one giant lawsuit that, even if oracle wins, they'd still have already bet (and lost) the family farm. Blood from a rock.
Maybe. But above of some level of fail and delusion you do not get access to the good layers anymore. Just look at Trump.
but Oracle has become buggy and with major behavior changes between minor versions, both in SQL and in configuration, an utter trainwreck my employer had to fight with 12C and beyond
They were only ""decent"" then because everyone else sucked at getting a stable db.  I tested 4 db in about 1990 and the other 3 worked badly.  Oracle's install script had some poor assumptions but once worked around worked as a db.  One of the DB got installed and kept getting ""internal errors"" and support says reinstall will probably fix it, so given we were evaluating it for 50+ installs that lack of understanding was unacceptable.
And unlike banks that fail and take others money with them, Oracle failing s

I thought that what Oracle was really good at was trapping customers into oppressive contracts and using legal action to extract money.
Should have failed 30 years ago.
Absolutely horrific database, and worse company.
And that's before you get to the Tiny Orange Mushroom sucking CEO.
If the AI-idiots at Oracle overdid it and Oracle dies, there is at least one good outcome from the current AI craze.
Isn't Oracle's major involvement in AI just being cloud provider for place to run it?  The actual AI companies would just move elsewhere, Oracle is 3% of that market.
I wonder if this is a flag that the AI bubble is primed and ready for something small to pop it. Curious if CDSs on other tech giants have similar behavior.
Daughter of Julie Hotdog and Andrew Hoagie.
I'm not that knowledgeable about database stuff, though I did, in a previous life, work as a contractor at one time or another for Oracle, Informix, and Sybase.  (I did backend stuff, meat and potatoes C programming, not database stuff with SQL or anything like that.)  I was there when Informix kind of bit the dust and developers were leaving in droves for Oracle.  (Sigh, Informix was a good place to work too, but then they got a CEO who screwed things up.  Enough digression.)

Tether’s USDT, the dominant dollar-pegged stablecoin with nearly $185 billion in circulation, just took a hit from traditional finance rating powerhouse S&P Global, as it downgraded its assessment of USDTâs ability to maintain its peg from 4 to 5, which is the weakest score on its associated scale.
S&P originally rolled out its stablecoin rating framework in 2023 to gauge risks like liquidity, governance, and asset backing in the emerging sector. According to their recent report on USDT, Tether’s reserves have shifted toward more volatile holdings over the past year. These perceived riskier assets, such as bitcoin, gold, secured loans, and corporate bonds, now make up 24% of the reserve mix, up from 17% in 2024.
One of S&Pâs sharpest criticisms in its downgrade of USDT lies in its growing reliance on bitcoin in particular as a reserve asset, now comprising 5.6% of the backing, which is well above the 3.9% reserve buffer Tether itself flagged in its latest quarterly report (PDF). According to S&P, this exposure amplifies risks tied to bitcoin’s notorious volatility.
S&P also sees serious issues regarding transparency at Tether, as the stablecoin issuerâs attestations offer little more than high-level snapshots, with zero granularity on who holds these assets, how they’re custodied, or what counterparties lurk in the shadows.
That said, Tetherâs reserves still lean heavily on short-term U.S. Treasuries and cash equivalents, accounting for 75% of the reserves. Despite the alleged red flags from S&P, USDT has held its $1 peg through many of crypto’s wild rides over the years, notably handling billions in redemptions without a hitch during the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.
A Tether spokesperson told Reuters the company “strongly disagrees” with S&P’s assessment, which uses an outdated model that ignores USDT’s track record and role as vital infrastructure in emerging markets.
Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino went further on X, framing the downgrade as a badge of honor: Tether “wears S&Pâs loathing with pride,” thriving as an “overcapitalized” outsider to a flawed legacy system. âThe classical rating models built for legacy financial institutions, historically led private and institutional investors to invest their wealth into companies that despite being attributed investment grade ratings collapsed,â Ardoino added.
In another post, Ardoino pointed to Tetherâs latest attestation announcement, where the company also claimed an excess reserve buffer approaching $30 billion; however, this is not explicitly part of USDTâs current reserves.
In another post, Ardoino referenced S&Pâs failures during the 2008 financial crisis, which were portrayed by a blind woman in the associated film The Big Short. S&P paid a $1.375 billion settlement in a related case with the U.S. Department of Justice regarding allegations that the ratings agency had defrauded investors with its ratings of financial products in the lead up to the housing crisis. Notably, Bitcoin itself was originally launched in January 2009, almost as a direct response to the collapse of trust involved in the financial crisis.
S&P be likehttps://t.co/gGBOPhrVFX
— Paolo Ardoino ð¤ (@paoloardoino) November 27, 2025

Just weeks before scrutinizing Tether, S&P also slapped a speculative ‘B-‘ issuer credit rating on bitcoin treasury company Strategy, highlighting the firm’s $80 billion-plus bitcoin hoard as a vulnerability that could cripple debt payments amid market plunges. The agency’s outlook stays stable for now, but it flags Strategy’s negative cash flow and bitcoin concentration as red flags, much like the volatility risks baked into USDT’s reserves.
While S&P sees issues with Tether and Strategy using bitcoin as a reserve asset, many other well-known institutions, such as the Harvard University Endowment and the state of Texas, are buying the crypto asset to hold for the long term and find it to be useful as an apolitical, digital store of value.
It should also be noted that S&P is largely focused on stablecoin issuersâ ability to redeem tokens for dollars in their assessments, so an asset like USDT where the issuer is operating more like a bank issuing its own private currency doesnât necessarily fit the mold perfectly. In other words, USDT may be viewed negatively by many in the traditional financial system because it is operating on a new standard built on bitcoin rather than the traditional, dollar-based system.

20,2025-11-30,"Thieves have stolen €90,000 (£79,000; $104,000) worth of snails from a farm in northern France that supplies gourmet restaurants.
L'Escargot Des Grands Crus in Bouzy, near Reims, said it had been robbed of its entire stock of fresh and frozen snails - a ""real blow"" ahead of the holiday season.
The thieves broke into the farm overnight into Monday, cutting a border fence before breaking into farm buildings, but a complaint was only filed with police later in the week, news site Franceinfo reported.
Officers are now on the trail, while the farm is trying to restock to meet the end-of-year demand from customers.
Edible snails - or escargots - are a French delicacy, usually cooked in garlic butter or wine before being extracted from their shell.
Producers in France see a rise in sales around December, as people shell out to have the treat during Christmas and New Year's Day celebrations.
""This is definitely not the kind of post we thought we'd write as the holidays approach,"" L'Escargot Des Grands Crus wrote in a statement announcing the theft on Thursday.
It went on to describe the incident as ""a shock, an incomprehension, and a real blow to the entire team"", adding: ""We are trying our best to replenish our stocks to satisfy you for the holidays.""
The farm has supplied restaurants including the Michelin-starred Les Crayères in Reims, as well as delicatessens and private clients, Franceinfo reports.
Photos of the farm following the theft show shelves and fridges nearly completely cleared of snail products.
""A whole section of finished products was stolen from the store, and raw material stock from my laboratory,"" Jean-Mathieu Dauvergne, the farm's manager, told the news site.
It was my end-of-year stock... We had just the right amount to get through the holidays without any worries.""
The pair are in the care of a reptile specialist looking to be rehomed.
The Desmoulin’s whorl snail is a protected species in the UK and lives in wetland.
Researchers in Cuba and the UK are working together to reveal the biological secrets of the beautiful but endangered Polymita snail. 
The owner of the niche restaurant supply business applied to turn the building into a holiday let.
""It makes me really happy that they won't end up boiling in a pot,"" the 18-year-old says.

When I saw a British newspaper warning that rich Americans were ""invading"" the Cotswolds, I had to see for myself if the headlines matched reality.
In late October, I made the 90-minute train journey from London to the quaint collection of towns and villages in the English countryside, as I've done many times for family holidays and weekend escapes.
I didn't find an ""invasion,"" but it was clear the Cotswolds is changing — and fast. This sense didn't just come from the American-sounding accents I heard on the streets, but from conversations with the people I met.
Long associated with Barbour jackets and tweed-clad royals, nowadays if the Cotswolds were a party, its guestlist would rival the Met Gala's.
Last year, Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi bought a $20 million estate here. Tom Cruise, as well as Jay-Z and Beyoncé, are rumored to be next. Recent visitors include Taylor Swift, Kourtney Kardashian, Bill Gates, and Vice President JD Vance — along with the rich and powerful who keep a low profile.
The Cotswolds was already a hotspot for the wealthy before Americans took serious interest. Its existing luxury amenities are part of its appeal, helping to create a cycle of upmarket offerings attracting more and more affluent visitors.
In 2023, the upscale American home furnishings brand RH opened shop on the grounds of a 17th-century country estate, and last year the Cotswolds added Estelle Manor to its roster of members' clubs, which also includes Soho House.
Meanwhile, Americans are among the ultra-wealthy snapping up heritage homes, a considerable number of which are on the market for upwards of $10 million.
This series looks at how the Cotswolds has transformed into a playground for America's rich and famous, earning it the nickname ""The Hamptons of England.""

Save $500 on the DJI Mavic 4 Pro, the best drone available, now at its lowest-ever price for Black Friday.
If you're looking for Cyber Monday deals this Black Friday weekend, you'll want to consider this one. In our DJI Mavic 4 Pro review, we praised it for its amazing camera movements, its fast and smooth flight and its impressive features, among many other things. It has three cameras and can capture footage in up to 6K and images with 100MP resolution. We're not sure how long this deal will last for, so if you're serious about drones and discounts, you'll have to act quickly.
Get the lowest-ever price on the DJI Mavic 4 Pro, a drone that has three cameras, can take 6K video and 100MP images. It's also stacked with useful features and is well built to deliver quick and smooth flight.
Alex is an E-commerce Writer for Space.com, which means that he has spent four and a half years hunting deals and writing about the ones worth getting. In his time, he has extensively covered drones and drone deals and is particularly impressed by the level of discount on offer here.
The DJI Mavic 4 Pro is packed full of useful features and great technology. It has advanced obstacle avoidance, return to home, impressive car tracking, a top speed of over 60mph and is resistant to winds up to 26.8 mph. The video transmission feed is massive at over 18 miles and you can fully rotate the camera while flying to deliver high-quality footage. It is a heavier drone, weighing 2.34 lbs / 1,063 g, so you'll have to register it to comply with local drone laws, but its foldable design makes it easy to transport.
We're into the Sunday of Black Friday weekend, which means Cyber Monday is upon us. This is unquestionably one of the best deals out there purely because it's the lowest price seen on a drone of this quality. You'll have to act soon if you want this saving though, as there's never a guarantee of stock or how long this deal will be live for.
Key features: Three cameras, 6K video, 100MP stills, 60mph-plus top speed, Return to Home, subject tracking, wind resistance, omnidirectional obstacle avoidance, more.
Product launched: May 2025
Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!
Price history: Before today's deal, this drone consistently retailed for around $2699, meaning that the $500 discount is genuine and this is good value.
Price comparison: Amazon: $2199 | Walmart: $3997 | Best Buy: $2999
Reviews consensus: Rated as the best drone on the market, it's by far the best Mavic drone ever made and takes drone technology to new heights. The image quality is fantastic and the flight performance is impressive.

Black Friday may have been two days ago, but almost all the best bargains are still going strong today. Across the web, you'll find people recommending devices they've never actually used at prices that aren't really discounted. WIRED’s list of the best Black Friday deals is not like that. Everything on this list has been hands-on tested by a member of our Reviews team and is recommended as worth the money at full price. But you won't pay full price, as all these items are also actually cheaper than you'll find them the rest of the year.
Updated November 30, 10:30 am ET: We've added new deals on fitness trackers and gear, hair tools, air purifiers, smart bird feeders, and pet accessories, and ensured accuracy of current pricing.

Dell (Core Ultra 5)
For $500, this Dell Windows laptop is actually good. The resolution is 2560 by 1600, with decent color accuracy and brightness. The battery life is downright impressive. And the touchpad, which is an area where many budget laptops compromise, actually feels smooth and responsive. This is something no other Windows laptop can pull off. The only catch is that it’s a Doorbuster-style sale on Dell's own site, meaning once they sell out at this price, this discount will disappear. —Luke Larsen

The M4 MacBook Air came out in early 2024, and it’s remained the best laptop you can buy. The price has slowly dropped, too. It’s now down to $749, and when you compare this directly with the quality of similarly priced laptops, you’ll see why it’s still at the top of my list. The display quality and resolution is top-notch, while the performance and battery life remain best in class. Now, you might be wondering if you should wait for the M5 MacBook Air instead of pulling the trigger on this deal. If the rumors are true, we’re still at least a few months out from the M5 MacBook Air, making this M4 still worthy of a purchase at this price. —Luke Larsen

I know a lot of people use headphones or earbuds at work, but it's your home office, there's still nothing like a solid pair of desk speakers to amplify your work-from-home setup. These Audioengine computer speakers rarely go on sale, so now’s a great time to pick up a pair. They’re our favorite computer speakers, with robust sound, and they won’t take up much room on a desk.

The $200 range used to buy you a crappy, 1080p monitor with terrible colors. But today, it can afford you a beautiful 4K monitor with a 120-Hz refresh rate and a fully-adjustable stand. It's IPS, but it has decent color coverage and accuracy, with a max brightness of 355 nits. Just be warned: it doesn't have built-in USB ports and the stand doesn't have enough height adjustment to be used as a vertical monitor. But for basic, at-home use, you won't find another monitor with the complete package that the Dell 27 Plus 4K has. —Luke Larsen

This is the Wi-Fi 7 router I recommend for most people in our best Wi-Fi routers guide because it’s easy to set up and will cover homes and apartments up to around 2,000 square feet with fast and reliable connectivity. It’s only dual-band, so you do miss out on the 6-GHz band, but you get all the other advantages of Wi-Fi 7. It also has a generous array of ports and comes with free security software and parental controls. Support for VPN service, separate IoT or guest networks, and Ai Mesh rounds out an excellent device. —Simon Hill

The current model of iPad (A16) has dropped below the $300 price we typically see on sales.

Google’s brand-new Pixel 10 is one of the best Android phones on the market right now. It’s rare to find a phone at this price, especially on sale, with a triple-camera system that includes a 5X optical zoom sensor so you won’t have trouble capturing sharp photos of birds up in the tree, your kid earning their diploma, or your favorite artist onstage. Not to mention this is one of the first flagship Android phones with Qi2 magnets, meaning, like Apple’s iPhones, you can magnetically attach the phone to wireless chargers and docks for speedy charging (and attach various fun magnetic accessories). Best of all is Google’s smart software; yes, there’s a lot of generative AI creep that isn’t super useful, but tools like Call Screen can filter out spam calls, and Now Playing automatically tells you what song is playing at the coffee shop without you having to lift a finger. Read our Best Pixel Phones guide for more details. —Julian Chokkattu

This is my favorite charger, and I’ve been using it for all my gadgets for several years. Nomad’s 65-watt charger is incredibly slim, and it can fit in the tiniest pouches of a bag or purse. It comes with two USB-C ports. When both are in use, you get 45 watts out of the left port and 20 out of the right. If one device is plugged in, the 65 watts of power is more than enough for tablets and phones, and should be sufficient for a MacBook Air or Windows laptop (unless it’s a high-powered machine). —Julian Chokkattu

After testing many, many Apple 3-in-1 wireless chargers, this is the one that claimed a permanent place on my bedside table.

The iPhone pad also tilts and holds your iPhone vertically or horizontally, with support for StandBy mode. It can fast-charge capable iPhone and Apple Watch models and charge any AirPods with a wireless charging case.

One of the best digital notebooks you can get is the reMarkable 2. It’s my favorite budget option, which might seem weird since it’s not necessarily the cheapest option (it’s the same price as the Kindle Scribe) it’s the best for the features and the available accessories like a keyboard folio at the price point, and it is a lower price point than you’ll find for the rest of reMarkable’s lineup or competitors like Supernote. You can get bundles (you’ll need to choose both a marker and folio) of the reMarkable 2 for $70 right now, letting you add on your favorite folio or upgrade the marker without paying as much as you usually would.

The main feature that this extremely well-priced robot vacuum has is that at 4- and 3.5-liter capacities, the clean/dirty water tanks are just ginormous. You won't have to switch them out too often. It also has an extendable arm for cleaning hard-to-reach places and a decent 11,000 Pa of suction.—Adrienne So

The debut of Dyson’s first tabletop-sized air purifier was just announced in September; it’s finally here, and we’ve tried it. Its claim to fame is that it uses electrostatic filtration, which incorporates electrically charged plates to attract dust, pollen, dander, and other allergens. In our guide to the Best Air Purifiers, WIRED contributor Lisa Wood Shapiro notes this means the filter can last up to five years, as opposed to six to 12 months like a typical HEPA. She thought it was a little loud, measuring twice the advertised decibels on its highest setting, but is otherwise a great option for smaller areas like bedrooms. —Kat Merck

It also boasts reliable AI recognition for people and pets, a direct Wi-Fi connection, and a siren to scare intruders away. The Arlo app is swift to load, boasts the best notifications, and supports two-factor authentication, so you can log in with your fingerprint or face, phone permitting. The catch is a pricey subscription (Arlo Secure costs $8 per month for one camera or $13 per month for unlimited cameras) that’s required for subject recognition, smart alerts, and cloud storage. —Simon Hill

Canopy is the best filtered shower wand I’ve tested, a tri-layer filter my tests showed to reduce the total chlorine levels in my water to undetectable levels out of the box, and maintain most of this effectiveness for a couple months before a refill. Filter replacement is easy, meaning you’re likely to actually do it, and Canopy’s filter replacements don’t cost as much as some competitors. The upfront price is usually more of a barrier, but half off is a very good discount. —Matthew Korfhage

This is the best price you’ll find all year for our all-around favorite smart bird feeder. It may not be the fanciest model, but it’s user-friendly and reliable. You can enjoy it without a subscription (though for the AI identification and image/video storage, you’ll want to spring for the extra $5 a month), and the app makes it easy to save and share great captures of birds. Note that Birdfy only works with 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, and the base model comes without a solar panel. I don’t mind this, as Birdfy’s panel has to be mounted separately, and it’s hard to do this when the feeder is installed on a pole, which is what I recommend. —Kat Merck

The systems do take a fair amount of maintenance, but as a busy, full-time working parent, it’s nothing I haven’t been able to handle. If you’ve been curious about these, all Gardyn systems are now 20 percent off for Black Friday, netting you $180 off a Home or $111 off a Studio. If you don’t mind the older, original studio, that’s on an even deeper discount for just $337.

The Breville Joule—the same oven, but with a handy autopilot feature— is on almost the same sale, and it’s $400. Both are the cheapest they’ve been this year.

If you already own an Apple Watch, I generally do not advocate upgrading to the latest model, given they’re all pretty iterative. I do think that this year’s Series 11 is worth getting because, for the first time ever, it really does have a full 24 hours of battery life. It's on sale for $369 right now. But last year’s Series 10 (Apple’s 10th anniversary watch) has the same S10 chip as the latest watches. It also has the same slim case, large screen, and is compatible with watchOS 26 (with an Apple Intelligence-enabled iPhone), so you can still enjoy the Liquid Glass design, Workout Buddy, and flick away Smart Stack with your wrist. —Adrienne So

Here it is; the one, the only, the legend—the original air styler that spawned a hundred imitators. I tested it for the first time this year for my guide to the Best Hair Straighteners. I had heard that it wasn’t a one-stop shop for 3a curly hair and above, and as you can see from my picture above, it’s not. I still needed to use a traditional flat iron afterward, especially on the top of my head. But the Dyson engineering and quality are evident in every small detail, from the Hyperdymium motor—same as in Dyson’s vacuum cleaners—to the glass bead thermistors that regulate the tool’s temperature. I can see how it would be life-changing for those with wavy or just generally easier-to-straighten hair. The Airstrait doesn’t go on sale all that often, so if it was on your Christmas shopping list, now is the time. —Kat Merck

Frankly, it’s a contender for my favorite grooming set overall in part because of the ridiculously good performance on the foil shaver attachment (Philips kills it on foil shavers in general). The metal body offers admirable heft and durability, and the battery will run a ridiculous five hours without needing a charge—months’ worth of shaves. What a beast. It’s a third off an already good price. —Matthew Korfhage

In the six-piece set, you’ll receive five rectangular-shaped cubes and a handy shoe bag.

Black Friday Retailers To Watch
Amazon: For better or worse, Amazon has changed the game when it comes to shopping—if you want it, Amazon probably sells it. In the tradition of Amazon Prime Day, Amazon is rolling out major discounts for Black Friday and Cyber Monday on everything from bedding to home office gear to TVs to air fryers. This is a good time to save on the brand’s own hardware, like Kindles and Blink security cameras, some of which are 50% off.
Walmart: The Arkansas-based big box store has lots of tech deals like the gray colorway of Beats Solo4 for $79 ($50 off) plus the home and garden deals you'd expect like a Blackstone griddle for $157 ($67 off).
REI: Outdoor co-op REI is a favorite among hikers, campers, and general outdoor enthusiasts. REI’s cyber week sale starts November 29, with rotating deals on a myriad of WIRED-tested products, though you will find their deals live now, notably not called “Black Friday.”
Home Depot: Home improvement projects and general home upkeep can get costly quick. Home Depot has Black Friday discounts for virtually everything you need for the home, including Christmas trees and smart home appliances.
Branch: We love Branch’s home office furniture, including some WIRED-tested favorite office chairs. Everything is 20 percent off for Black Friday, so now’s a great time to upgrade.
Helix: We love Helix mattresses—if you’re going to be spending a third of your life on something, it better be good. Upgrade your sleep for less with Helix’s Black Friday sale, with 25 percent off sitewide.
Target: Target has everything from groceries to flat screens to celebrity-endorsed beauty products. In addition to regular Black Friday sales, Target has price match guarantee and doorbuster clearance items.
Best Buy: In addition to major discounts for Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Best Buy rolls out new doorbusters every Friday, slashing prices on everything from refrigerators to MacBooks. We’ve rounded up the best Best Buy deals we’ve seen so far, including the latest Apple MacBook Pro (M5) for $1,349 ($250 off) and Google Pixel 10 for $599 ($200 off).
Dyson: Making everything from blow dryers to vacuums to air purifiers, we at WIRED are generally huge fans of this well-made, long-lasting (but often pricey) tech, made a lot more affordable with Black Friday sales.
Lowe’s: In addition to Black Friday sales, Lowe’s has rotating daily deals on home improvement essentials, upgraded appliances, and outdoor tools like grills and lawnmowers.
Atlas: At WIRED, we love caffeine, and subscription services. So we go bonkers for this coffee club subscription, and now you can get a free bag of beans for Black Friday.
Sephora: Not only does Sephora have a dizzying amount of cosmetics, it also carries some of our favorite WIRED-tested hair straighteners, blow dry brushes, and LED devices.

The Logitech MX Master 3S is one of the most comfortable and ergonomic wireless mice on the market. It features a sculpted design that makes using it for prolonged periods easy, programmable shortcut buttons, and a scroll wheel on the side for advanced functionality!
In our review, we called the MX Master 3S ""an incredible productivity-focused wireless mouse."" It has 7 programmable buttons, all of which can be customized with the dedicated Logi app that you can download online.
It also has a smart shift electromagnetic scroll wheel, which lets you change whether the scroll wheel itself is rigid or free flowing. The mouse will try to automatically switch between the two modes based on how much force you actuate the scroll wheel with, which is pretty neat.
The buttons themselves are very tactile, but are also super quiet. Logitech says this was one big focus for them when they were designing the mouse, ensuring it's as quiet as possible when in use.
The mouse can also connect to up to three devices, one of which is achieved with the included 2.4Ghz wireless adapter. It also supports Bluetooth connectivity, or you can use it wired by plugging in a USB-C cable.
While Logitech did just unveil the MX Master 4, that doesn't make the MX Master 3S any less of a good mouse. It's still one of the best, and now much more affordable thanks to this Cyber Monday deal.
The Logitech MX Master 3S is a professional grade wireless mouse designed for ergonomic comfort and productivity. It's an incredibly customizable mouse that's comfortable to use.

Before joining Google, Adrienne Lofton, Google's global vice president of marketing for Pixel and other devices, confessed to being a ""lifelong"" iPhone user.
Now, while the search giant's Pixel phone has a long way to catch up to Apple's iPhone, Lofton says it may stand a chance of becoming the AI device.
In October, I interviewed Lofton, who was really understanding when I reached for my iPhone to take notes during our chat. She talked about how her team uses Google AI products to shave months off the company's marketing strategy and how she thinks about positioning AI capabilities to consumers.
We also talked about new products like the Friend pendant, how ready the market is for AI, and what convinced her to make the switch to Pixel.
This Q&A has been edited for clarity and length.
Business Insider: Can you speak to Google's marketing considerations for presenting its AI tools against the backdrop of organizations questioning the costs and productivity gains from using AI?
Adrienne Lofton: On the consumer side, one of the things we talk about from a Gemini perspective is the fact that it is easily integrated into our Google Suite, which we think is our biggest differentiator.
We always lean into the ability to supercharge productivity as well as creativity, and being able to do that 10-fold if you compare it to the competitors in the marketplace, because we have an integrated stack.
So, you can use Gemini in Gmail, in Photos, and all the apps you already know and love, and the other piece that we talk a lot about for the consumer is that Gemini is just a more intuitive product that's easier to use.
Every competitor right now is screaming generative AI from the mountaintops. If you look at consumer data, not enterprise data, 50% of consumers are adopting, while 50% remain quite skeptical.
What we continue to push on is making sure there's a clear consumer benefit that you can see and trial exactly what it can do for you.
Given all the innovation happening within Pixel, from its camera to Gemini integrations, what do you make of new AI-first devices like the Friend pendant, which offer a new form-function beyond a phone, laptop, or tablet? Or the yet-to-come ""family of devices"" OpenAI has mentioned?
A consumer wants to communicate, and so I do think there's something interesting about our industry leaping 10 steps ahead of where our consumer is. In all of the research that we're seeing, back to that 50% adopting, 50% rejecting is because, in some ways, the industry is forcing AI into consumers' hands.
With Pixel, we're running on a Google stack; it is our tensor chip that enables our software and our AI to perform better and faster. But that is not how we're telling the story, and consumers are not yet asking any brand for it.
What we want to do is stay at the forefront to ensure that customers know, for example, if they're using Camera Coach, that it is actually powered by our Gemini model. All Camera Coach does for you is help you take a better shot. So, we're not overindexing on the AI story of what powers Camera Coach, but we are making sure consumers know that our technology allows you to do things easier, faster, and better.
We also know that people are buying devices for these top five reasons: hardware, form factor, brand, price, and the operating system. If we don't overdeliver on those particular specs that's driving the buy, then AI will be meaningless.
So it's what's inside that counts!
Exactly! And it's been an interesting education with the consumer, because if you start to look at their recall, what comes back for Google Pixel, every time is, ""man, that camera's cool.""
But, inside that camera is Auto Best Take, which allows you to add someone else to a photo and even crop that person into the photo. That's Gemini-powered. We're not talking about the power of Gemini; we're talking about everybody deserves to be in the photo; you don't just have to take a selfie.
The way we think about hardware, software, and AI as a stack is critically important. Not necessarily leading with an AI conversation, but what it does for you.
How are you fighting to keep exploring big non-AI ideas when Google is so focused on AI?
With the devices team, it is a very interesting proposition that we offer as the only hardware division inside Google, which is a software-first company.
Within Google Pixel, and I would include FitBit in that as well as our home devices, we remind ourselves that the reason for being for our products in today's consumer mindset is the hardware, the software, battery life, and the basic fundamentals of what it takes to drive a best-in-class device.
It takes about a year to make a phone, and that phone is going to hit a shelf no matter what, and so we harness the right AI features and stories that we want to bring into our devices. It's quite a magical process, but making sure that we never forget that these things are two parts equally important, versus software and AI always leading, you've got to have beautiful hardware. You cannot miss a beat.
To go in a different direction, the race to secure top talent is reaching new heights; you've seen the multimillion-dollar pay packages. What is most important when recruiting for AI talent?
What you're seeing from Google is we're getting the best talent in the world bar none across every subfunctional area of expertise, whether we're talking engineers, product management, product marketing, all the way through to creativity, And first of all, before the AI race, the qualifications that it takes to get into Google, the bar is extreemly high, so that has not changed.
In marketing, we seek curious, AI-first thinkers. By AI-first, I mean the way of making has completely broken itself and rebuilt itself overnight.
You would write a brief on paper, you would storyboard an idea and a concept, and you would then go shoot a mock to make sure it actually works. Right now, if you have a thought of a brief, you could put that into Gemini Live. It will triangulate that brief with the insights we're seeing in the social sphere, what we're hearing from YouTube, and what we're seeing from our insights team.
I always write a brief, and I ask, ""What would a cynical consumer say?"" and it tells me a story that I might not have thought about. What's interesting about the kind of talent we need is that it has to be a curious talent that isn't afraid of AI, but instead harnesses it to create better outputs and outcomes for the organization.
We're using Veo 3, our own product, to shoot every concept before we go to market. We literally have shaved 15 weeks off the go-to-market process because we know how to harness our own Google tools. But we have people on our side of the fence that actually want to lean in, and you know, there's a lot of trial, there's a lot of error, a lot of teaching the model on how we want to think about the world.
However, this is a once-in-a-generation moment where we are shaping the future tools.
What else should people know about your team at Pixel?
The Google Pixel team is extremely bullish and excited to bring our new products to market.
Whether it's through creativity, products like Nano Banana — that broke the App Store because it's been so well-received — all the way through to everyday productivity tools, we're seeing our consumers lean in and understand how to harness our devices in ways they cannot with our competitors.
As I always tell our team, as a challenger, we are the underdog in this game, but it's the best place to be in order to punch above our weight, show consumers what's possible.
It's not lost on me that I'm taking notes on this interview on an iPhone, but maybe next time it will be a Pixel!
It's OK! If it had been a Pixel, it would have intuitively picked up what was coming next. It's funny; before I came to Google, I was a lifetime Apple user. Marketers normally are.
When you come in and then switch OSs over to Pixel, you first notice the camera and the video quality. You're also a content creator, so you will want a Pixel.
That whole agentic space we're headed into is always best done on a premium Android device, and most specifically, I'd say within a Pixel.

28,2025-11-30,"The updated specs of the M5 iPad Pro may point toward a major new feature for Apple's next-generation Studio Display expected in early 2026.
Apple's latest ‌iPad Pro‌ debuted last month and contains one display-related change that stands out: it can now drive external monitors at up to 120Hz with Adaptive Sync. The feature should deliver lower latency, smoother motion, and fewer visual artifacts during workflows such as gaming and video editing, with Adaptive Sync further minimizing latency for rapid-response tasks.
This is the first time an iPad has supported 120Hz output to an external monitor and the timing aligns closely with Apple's development of a next-generation Studio Display. Although Macs have long supported 120Hz external displays, Apple has yet to ship a standalone monitor with a refresh rate above 60Hz, and they are fairly unusual in the market as a whole.
Rumors from multiple sources suggest Apple is preparing a significant Studio Display update for early 2026. Earlier this year, MacRumors found references in Apple code to a new external monitor codenamed J427, which will include the A19 Pro chip. 
Display industry analyst Ross Young has said Apple is developing a 27-inch monitor with mini-LED backlighting. Mini-LED technology would improve brightness, contrast, and color performance compared to the current 27-inch 5K LCD panel.
It would also bring the monitor in line with the MacBook Pro, which has touted mini-LED technology since 2021. In combination with a potential ProMotion 120Hz refresh rate on the Studio Display, this would bring it fully into line with the ‌MacBook Pro‌.
Bloomberg's Mark Gurman says Apple plans to release a next-generation Studio Display or equivalent replacement external monitor as soon as early next year alongside new Macs with the M5 chip.
Apple launched the Studio Display in March 2022 alongside the Mac Studio. It features a 5K LCD display, 60Hz refresh rate, 600 nits of brightness, built-in camera and speakers with Center Stage and Spatial Audio support, the A13 Bionic chip, ""Hey Siri"" commands, one Thunderbolt 3 port, and three USB-C ports. Pricing in the U.S. starts at $1,599.
The combination of new 120Hz external display support on the M5 ‌iPad Pro‌ and the increasing likelihood of a major Studio Display refresh early next year adds weight to the idea that Apple is preparing a higher refresh rate for its upcoming monitor, but it remains speculation for now.

When it comes to finding different deals to share, you'll rarely see me recommend a Chromebook for under $150. This is because those sub-$150 Chromebook deals just aren't worth it. But, I'm breaking my personal rule after seeing that Lenovo's Slim 3 Chromebook is just $119, a savings of $200.
In fact, I'd even go so far as to say that this is the only time you should really buy the Slim 3 Chromebook. It usually fluctuates in pricing whenever it's not Black Friday, Cyber Monday, or Prime Day, but I've never seen this Chromebook for this cheap.
Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 Chromebook: $319 $119 at Best Buy
As long as you temper your expectations, and understand what this Chromebook is capable of, this might just be the best Cyber Monday deal of them all. It's not often that you find a good Chromebook on sale for under $150, but that's exactly what we have with the Slim 3 Chromebook.
Price check: Lenovo - $119 | Walmart - $178
✅Recommended if: You're in the market for a cheap laptop or tablet to do some lightweight tasks, and don't care about a convertible design or touchscreen.
❌Skip this deal if: You're on the lookout for a cheap Chromebook, but need something with a bit more power or one that at least includes a touchscreen.
So what makes this such a compelling deal? The answer is simple, really: it's just a well-rounded machine. This is the case with many of Lenovo's other Chromebooks, regardless of how cheap, or expensive, they can get.
With the Slim 3 in particular, you're getting a 14-inch display with a 1920 x 1080 resolution which makes for a nice and crisp screen. While this model in particular doesn't feature a touchscreen, that's not really a bother since you can't flip the screen back and use it as a tablet anyways.
As for performance, we have the MediaTek Kompanio 520 at the helm, paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of eMMC storage. This is usually the point where I would tell you to stay away, but Lenovo found magic in a bottle here. No, you won't be able to have a slew of app windows and Chrome tabs open at the same time, but it's great for lighter browsing.
What seals the deal for me is the battery life. Lenovo rates the Slim 3 Chromebook to last for more than 13 hours, and that's even with a 1080p display. A lot of times, I'll see a cheap Chromebook rated to last that long, only to find out that it's using a 720p screen, which isn't exactly ideal.

30,2025-11-30,"Get the right phone this Cyber Monday.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

It's safe to say that 2025 has been a good year for phone launches. I had over 75 phones delivered this year, and whether it's the tri-folding Huawei Mate XT, the incredibly-thin OPPO Find N5 or Honor Magic V5, the vibrant iPhone 17 Pro (I got the orange one), or the Find X8 Ultra with its outstanding cameras, there have been plenty of standouts this year.
Most flagships started using silicon batteries, leading to devices like the Find X9 Pro and its 7,500mAh battery, and Vivo outdid itself with the cameras on the X300 Pro. While these phones are limited to select global regions, there's a decent selection of phones to consider if you're in North America.
Google got its act together this year with the Pixel 10 Pro XL, delivering a flagship that excels in all areas. The Pixel 9a, meanwhile, is the best budget phone around. And if you need an all-rounder that gets everything right, the OnePlus 13 is still my go-to recommendation. With Black Friday in the past and Cyber Monday set to roll out, now is the best time to buy a phone if you're looking to do so.
The Pixel 9a is all the phone you need if you just want a budget device with great cameras. It is great to hold and use, the software is the best you'll see in this segment, and it will get more updates than any other budget phone. At $349, there just isn't any other phone that's as good. 
I like the OnePlus 13 more than the OnePlus 15, and that's why I'm recommending it. The phone is still plenty fast, and if anything, it's showing no signs of slowing down. It has amazing battery life, terrific cameras with Hasselblad tuning (the OnePlus 15 doesn't have this), and at $699, it costs a lot less than its Samsung rivals. 
The Pixel 10 Pro XL is one of my favorite phones of 2025. While Samsung also did a good job this year, Google rectified long-standing issues with the Pixel 10 Pro XL, making it a better choice. The cameras are outstanding, the software is a delight to use, and the phone is faster than its predecessors — a big deal in its own right. If you're using an older Pixel or Galaxy phone and want a true flagship, I'd suggest getting the Pixel 10 Pro XL right now. 
I don't say this every year, the sale is particularly relevant if you're in the market for a phone but haven't one yet. With phone prices going up next year, this is the best time to get a new phone while they're still relatively affordable, and there are decent deals to be had. The Pixel 9a is now selling at just $349, and honestly, it's a terrific choice if you just need a reliable phone. It nails the basics, has a great in-hand feel, and the rear design is pretty great thanks to a camera module that sits flush with the body. The cameras are the best in this category, you get a clean software with fast updates, and there isn't much missing on this phone.
If you've used a Samsung phone and are considering switching over to another manufacturer, I highly recommend the OnePlus 13, which is now down to $699. It's significantly more affordable than the Galaxy S25 models, but you still get amazing cameras, better battery life than any Samsung phone, and a level of fluidity that One UI can't come close to.
And if you're ready to embrace AI features and want a phone that does the best job in this area, you should get the Pixel 10 Pro XL. The phone usually costs $1,199, but Google has a $300 discount right now, bringing it down to $899. That's still quite a lot of cash, but the Pixel 10 Pro XL is the best Google phone yet, and having used every single Pixel in the last decade, I'm confident in recommending the device.

31,2025-11-30,"A one-of-a-kind design and great sound? Say less!

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Nothing's wireless earbuds haven't always impressed me, but the brand's wireless over-hear headphones are arguably the best-value options on the market. I already told you about the $79 deal for the CMF Headphone Pro — which is somehow still live on Amazon after Black Friday. However, if you want to pay a bit more for a pair of headphones with way better sound and ANC, you should be looking at the Nothing Headphone 1.
I thought the Nothing Headphone 1's $299 price point was aggressive when the headphones first came out. They're good enough to rival headphones like the Sonos Ace, Sony WH-1000XM6, Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2, and AirPods Max, while being considerable cheaper. That's why it's shocking that Nothing cut an extra $60 off Headphone 1 for Cyber Monday, bringing the headphones down to just $239 if you move fast.
Nothing blew into the over-ear headphone scene with Headphone 1, a wireless ANC offering with audio tuning from KEF. It'll last up to 80 hours with ANC off, and has an eight-band EQ in the Nothing X companion app for audio personalization. Plus, it features Nothing's stunning transparent design. 
Price comparison: Walmart - $239 | Nothing - $239
✅Recommended if: you want a stylish pair of over-ear headphones that stand out; you like a bass-heavy sound profile with a great EQ; you want tactile buttons for simple control.
❌Skip this deal if: the 3.5mm jack requires battery power for analog connection; sound might need some tuning out of the box.
Every good pair of headphones offers great sound, but there's something special about the Nothing Headphone 1. Surprisingly, it's not that the out-of-the-box sound signature is excellent. My colleague Harish loves it, but I'd slightly prefer a more balanced profile. That leads to the best part about the Headphone 1 — they're incredibly easy to personalize with a detailed eight-band EQ in the Nothing X app.
You can quickly pick a few preset EQ options to immediately change the sound, or adjust each of the eight EQ bands separately with precise control. I can turn the ""more treble"" preset on to instantly make the Headphone 1 sound exactly how I want, with balance between the lows and highs.
The entire experience is backed by a custom 40mm dynamic driver enclosed with 8.9mm of polyurethane to limit distortion.
Then, there are the Headphone 1's intangibles and design, which you can appreciate regardless of whether you're deep in the Nothing ecosystem. You get comfortable, soft ear cushions, an aluminum shell, and a clear plastic covering that reveals a crafted transparent design. If you have a Nothing phone already, it'll match like no other.
 



The Nothing Headphone 1 feels comfortable and light, although its official 329-gram weight is technically on the heavier side. It goes to show how well-distributed the weight is across the headband and pads. Additionally, there is support for hi-res audio codecs like LDAC and 35-hour battery life with ANC on.
Throw it all together, and Headphone 1 are a steal even at full price. When you consider the extra $60 discount for Cyber Monday? These are the best midrange headphones you can find, sitting between the cheaper CMF Headphone Pro and the more expensive Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2.

The fanciful, futuristic dream of an AI era has been powered by present-day energy all along. Increasingly, though, it looks like itâs going to be powered by yesterdayâs energy too, by which I mean coal, an energy source with climate change externalities comparable to other combustible fuel, but with deadly effects on the local environment.
Now, according to a Politico report, itself drawn from a report by the think tank Frontier Group, utilitiesâ plans to retire 30 coal-burning units have now been delayed in order to supply energy to data centers.
As EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin wrote in a Fox News op-ed (also quoted by Politico), âTo meet growing demand from domestic manufacturing and the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence data centers, Americaâs coal-powered powerplants must remain in operation.â
Throughout most of the Obama era and the first two Trump yearsâthe span from 2010 to the beginning of 2019âannouncements from US energy companies heralded the coming shutdowns of 546 coal generating units. That means 102 gigawatts, a decommissioning project the size of (by my math) New York City in the summer ten times over.
As Grist pointed out all the way back in 2012, coalâs decline appeared to have little to do with environmental restrictions. It was âprimarily due to changing market conditions, not environmental rule revisions, which have trended towards more lenient requirements and schedules.â
Similarly, market conditions today are bringing it back. Look out, lungs.
A report on the National Institutes of Health website (somehow itâs still up) notes that âbetween 1999 and 2020, 460,000 deaths would not have occurred in the absence of emission from the coal power plants.â
Obama did, for the record, eventually impose emissions limits target coal, and the first Trump Administration set out to annihilate them during Trumpâs first year on office. That effort succeeded in 2019. In his second administration, Trump has seemingly set out to increase not only the ubiquity of coal, but its potential deadliness, by further chipping away at what safeguards there are. Politico says almost 70 power plants are being allowed to simply not comply to 2027 mercury-and-soot limitations from the EPA while the EPA crafts new, more lenient laws.
And as Gizmodo noted earlier this year, Trump has praised âbeautiful, clean coalâ while dismantling workplace protections for miners. Unions have sued the administration for pausing long-sought silica dust regulationsârules the Department of Labor estimated would save 1,000 lives.
So, of course, Trump will give himself credit as the savior of the coal industry. Trump didn’t invent AI demand, but you have to admit, he’s certainly sweetening market conditions for the shareholders who extract, profit from coalâall while workers and bystanders pay the price, sometimes with their lives.

Meena Lakdawala-Flynn knew what it meant to perform under pressure years before becoming a partner at one of the country's top banks.
Lakdawala-Flynn, cohead of Global Private Wealth Management and One Goldman Sachs, started doing gymnastics when she was two years old. By the time she was eight, Lakdawala-Flynn said she was exercising between 30 and 40 hours a week, and dead-set on going to the Olympics.
Yet even though Olympic glory wasn't in Lakdawala-Flynn's future — ""I grew four inches, I put on 20 pounds, and I wasn't good enough,"" she told Business Insider — the years in the gym still echo in her work on Wall Street.
""The moment I stepped foot on that trading floor, the same competitive juices that I had in gymnastics came out in something else,"" she said of her first finance internship at an investment boutique. In her years rising at Goldman, Lakdawala-Flynn said she has relied on the work ethic, grit, perseverance, and need to perform that she mastered during her time as a gymnast. Even though gymnastics is an individual sport, competing on a team in college influenced her ability to form key relationships at Goldman.
""Gymnastics is won in millimeter-level details under pressure, so is working in finance,"" Lakdawala-Flynn told Business Insider in an email. She said the same is true of her job: the small, precise changes she makes to models, risk assessments, and client meetings can lead to big advantages.
Athletes have become an important talent and recruiting pool for Goldman Sachs, which hired a former NFL star in 2018 and promoted him to managing director in 2022. Business Insider previously spoke to three former D-1 college athletes who work at Goldman about how their experiences have helped them stand out and get ahead.
""It is a way to differentiate yourself,"" Jacqueline Arthur, Goldman's head of human capital management, previously told Business Insider about why athletes are compelling applicants. ""These qualities are not just transferable but powerful and directly applicable to the dynamic environment of financial services.""
Those qualities don't just have to come from sports, though.
Lakdawala-Flynn said that being seriously devoted to any craft can teach the same teamwork and dedication common among many successful people.
""If you have that amount of passion, curiosity, and dedication, and you rise to become one of the best, it's the same skill sets, whether it's an athlete or not an athlete,"" she said.
Landing a job at Goldman isn't easy, especially for Gen Zers who are trying to differentiate themselves in a challenging job market. The firm received more than 360,000 applicants for its 2025 summer internship program, and accepted less than 1% of hopefuls.

Real estate professionals and industry experts are keeping a close eye on a few key markets heading into 2026, which means you should too.
Consulting firm PwC, in partnership with the Urban Land Institute (ULI), released its Emerging Trends in Real Estate report for 2026, highlighted by its ranking of the top markets to watch. The rankings are based on a survey of more than 1,000 industry experts who rated markets based on their investment and development prospects.
Though the Sun Belt has often been billed as an up-and-coming region boasting a mostly affordable cost of living; this list highlights the Northeast as a region with upsides going into 2026.
""There are four Northeast markets in the top 10,"" PwC partner Andrew Alperstein told Business Insider. ""It's really a story around New York City and some of the back to office and back to living in the city that we've seen, and the accessibility of places like Brooklyn and Jersey City — which, for the millennial younger crowd, is a little bit more affordable, still proximate to New York City, and has a good amenity base.""
Jersey City, New Jersey, experienced the largest positive jump among the top 10 markets, rising 17 spots from the previous year, capitalizing on its proximity to Manhattan. People returning to the office need places to eat, places to shop, and most importantly, places to live. Jersey City invested $177.4 million in the first half of 2025, and 65% of that investment volume went toward apartments, according to data from CBRE Research and MSCI.
While some Southern markets like Austin have seen major growth in recent years, they've since cooled off due to a lack of economic diversity, according to Alperstein. Only two Texas markets cracked the top 10, and only three made the top 25.
""There was almost a little bit of an exuberance around Austin with a lot of the focus on technology, and it's probably a little bit too technology centric, relative to somewhere like Dallas or Miami that has more diversification in employment and in their employment growth,"" he said.
The cities that are thriving going into 2026 are ones that can offer affordability, a healthy job market, and amenities without too many sacrifices.
Below are PwC and ULI's markets to watch for 2026.

The Xbox wireless controller works with a lot more than just Xbox consoles and it connects easily to Windows PCs, Android phones, iOS devices, Fire TV Sticks, smart TVs and VR headsets using Bluetooth or Xbox Wireless technology. This universal compatibility gets rid of the hassle of having to switch between controllers for different platforms and now you can use one controller across all of your gaming systems.
The good news is that Amazon still has some stock left over from Black Friday so they’re offering an unbeatable Cyber Monday deal that drops the price of this 2025 carbon black model from $64 to $39. That’s almost 40% off Microsoft’s famous controller and all color options are on sale, though some are already selling out quickly.
See at Amazon
Microsoft changed the shape of the controller so that the surfaces are sculpted to fit naturally in your hands: This makes it easier to play for long periods of time without getting tired. The textured grip now covers the triggers, bumpers, and back case and it gives your fingers better grip when things get intense and your palms get sweaty.
The hybrid D-pad combines the accuracy of a traditional directional pad with the smoothness of a disc design. This makes it just as good for fighting games that need precise quarter-circle motions as it is for platformers that need quick changes in direction. With two AA batteries, the battery life can last up to 40 hours and it means you can game for weeks without having to change the batteries, depending on how often you play.
The Share button is right below the Xbox logo so you can take screenshots or record gameplay clips right away without having to go through menus or stop what you’re doing: You can easily share great moments from PC games, mobile games, or console games with this feature on all of your connected devices. You won’t forget about the button like you do with similar features on other controllers because it feels natural where it is.
Wireless connectivity works with both the Xbox Wireless protocol for Xbox consoles with very low latency and standard Bluetooth for everything else and it also pairs devices seamlessly and remembers multiple devices at once. Once you’ve paired your Xbox Series X and Android phone, switching between them is as easy as pressing a button. You can also plug any wired headset into the 3.5mm headphone jack and it will send game audio and chat through your headphones and let you control the volume if your headset supports it.
The controller works perfectly with all Xbox consoles including the Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and also with Windows 10 or 11 PCs. The wireless protocol is optimized for streaming, so Xbox Game Pass Ultimate cloud gaming feels responsive. The controller works with Fire TV devices for couch gaming through Amazon’s Luna service or emulators. It also turns smart TVs into casual gaming platforms and even works with VR headsets that support gamepad input for games that don’t require motion control.
The controller comes with two AA batteries but you can replace them with rechargeable batteries or buy Microsoft’s Play and Charge Kit separately to add built-in rechargeable capability. The Xbox Accessories app sends out firmware updates every so often and these updates add new features and make things work better with other devices, or improve performance based on what users say.
Getting this controller for $39 instead of $64 is a great deal because hardware like this usually stays expensive all year because there is always a high demand for it. You’re getting here Microsoft’s newest controller, which has better ergonomics, a 40-hour battery life, works with all devices, and lets you customize the mapping for less than many third-party options that don’t have as many features.

The DualSense Edge controller from Sony is rarely on sale because competitive gamers and PlayStation fans who want pro-level customization always want it. The price finally went down to $169 on Black Friday which is less than the usual $199 but Amazon is going even lower for Cyber Monday, bringing it down to $159. If you waited until Black Friday to see if the deal would get better, your patience has paid off with this new record low that makes upgrading to pro controller features much cheaper than it was just a few days ago.
See at Amazon
Sony made the DualSense Edge with replaceable stick modules to fix the most common problem with modern controllers: worn potentiometers inside the thumbstick assemblies that cause analog stick drift. If you use the controller for months or years and it starts to drift, you can just replace the module instead of the whole $200 controller and this modular method saves money in the long run and keeps your investment working like new.
What’s more, the two back buttons can be attached to either backplate and give you a total of four extra inputs that you can program to act like any other button on the controller. This placement lets you keep your thumbs on the analog sticks during important times instead of moving them to the face buttons and it gives you an edge in shooters where jumping or crouching while keeping aim control makes the difference between winning and losing.
You can set how far the L2 and R2 triggers travel before registering a full press with adjustable trigger stops. There are three preset distances that cover everything from hair-trigger sensitivity to full range motion. The shortest setting is best for fast-paced FPS games because it lets you fire weapons with very little finger movement, which cuts down on reaction time by milliseconds that are important in competitive play.
You can completely change the functions of any button on the PS5 by going to the accessory settings: You can also turn off certain buttons if you keep accidentally pressing them. You can change crouch from circle to a back button, jump from L1 to L2, or make your own layouts that work with how you remember how to play on other platforms. The controller saves these settings to three different profiles that are stored in the hardware: You can switch between them right away by holding down the profile button and picking the one you want. This means you can have a profile that works best for Call of Duty, one that works best for Fortnite, and one that works best for racing games without having to change settings every time you switch games.
The braided USB cable that comes with the controller has a connector housing that keeps it in place so you won’t accidentally disconnect it while you’re playing wired. This also means you won’t have to deal with the annoyance of losing connection in the middle of a match because the cable wiggled loose. The carrying case protects the controller and holds all the extra parts, like spare stick caps, back button sets, and the connector housing.
The battery life is a little shorter than the standard DualSense because of the extra hardware for customization features: It usually lasts 5â7 hours of active play while the base model lasts 8-12 hours.
Grabbing the DualSense Edge for $159 instead of $199 saves you $40 on professional controller features that typically command premium pricing across the gaming industry. With the Cyber Monday pricing ending soon, this record low represents your best opportunity to upgrade your PS5 gaming experience before stock clears.

A powerful and unusual wave of global capital is rushing into US markets. Foreign investors are buying American equities at a record pace, Treasury demand is reshuffling at a structural level, and domestic inflows are accelerating into year-end.
At the same time, US consumer debt has hit its highest level in history. For crypto and equity investors, the scale and direction of these flows signal a major shift in risk appetite and global macro positioning.
Private investors outside the US purchased $646.8 billion in US equities in the 12 months ending September 2025, according to data cited by Yardeni Research.
JUST IN: 🇺🇸 Private investors outside U.S. purchased record $646.8 billion of U.S. equities in the 12 months ending in September 2025 – Yardeni Research. pic.twitter.com/9dPxGJoS3g
This marks the highest level on record, surpassing the 2021 peak by 66%, with flows doubling since January.
The buying is not limited to US equities. Foreign private-investor purchases of US Treasuries totalled $492.7 billion in the same period. Rolling 12-month non-US buying of Treasuries has remained above $400 billion for four consecutive years, reflecting persistent global demand for dollar-denominated safety.
“Everyone wants US assets,” analysts at the Kobeissi Letter remarked.
The composition of foreign Treasury holders is shifting in ways not seen in decades:
These shifts suggest a long-term repositioning of sovereign and private capital, a trend with direct implications for interest rates, liquidity, and market volatility.
Something unusual is happening in the US Treasury market:China’s Treasury holdings as a % of all foreign holdings is down to 7.6%, the lowest in 23 years.This percentage has declined -20 points over the last 14 years.As a result, China now ranks as the world’s 3rd-largest… pic.twitter.com/JWJ4bbhbsy
US investors have poured an extraordinary $900 billion into equity funds since November 2024, according to JPMorgan data, with half of that total, $450 billion, arriving in just the last five months.
Fixed-income funds added another $400 billion, while all other asset classes combined attracted only $100 billion.
Inflows into US equities have exceeded those into all other asset classes combined, reinforcing the strength of the bid for US risk assets.
While institutional and foreign investors are ramping up their exposure, US households are under growing financial pressure. Total US credit-card debt climbed to $1.233 trillion in Q3 2025, the highest level ever recorded.

This divergence between market optimism and consumer strain raises questions about sustainability, earnings resilience, and the timing of potential policy shifts.
JP Morgan expects the S&P 500 to reach 8,000 next year, a view reinforced by powerful seasonal tailwinds. This projection comes as markets anticipate the bank’s “everything rally” forecast shared just over a week ago.
S&P 500 could hit 8,000 next year says JP Morgan 🥳📈🤑🫂 pic.twitter.com/l8zYgPAtWS
December has historically been the strongest month for US stocks, with the S&P 500 rising 73% of the time since 1928 and delivering an average return of +1.28%.
For both crypto and equity markets, the surge in capital flows toward the US signals rising confidence in American assets, or a lack of attractive alternatives abroad.
Investors will watch to see whether these inflows accelerate in 2026, how Treasury demand shifts as global holdings rebalance, and whether record consumer debt becomes a drag on macroeconomic momentum.
With liquidity building and seasonality strengthening, both traditional markets and digital assets are entering a potentially decisive phase.

Emily Reynolds runs a PR company, and with that responsibility comes the pressure to look young, she tells me.
She's 44 but often passes as younger, and that's by design. Reynolds has tried Botox, filler, laser facials, hydrofacials, and invests in expensive skincare products. She has a Peloton and does intense workouts a la Barry's Bootcamp. She's walking the precarious line, she tells me, between looking mature enough to show she's an experienced professional who can run and mentor a team, and young enough to be relevant.
Even as she thinks critically about beauty standards imposed on women, Reynolds worries what would happen to her business and professional reputation if she abandoned her rituals and routines — and what's going to happen as she continues to age. ""How long will I be quote-unquote publicly perceived as attractive?"" Reynolds says. ""And when I'm not, what happens to me professionally? That's the thing I think about daily.""
While talking about looks in the corporate world remains taboo, years of research show attractive people tend to gain more trust than their plainer-looking counterparts, and that pretty and thin people tend to land jobs and advance up the career ladder to earn more money than others. Now, thanks to filters, Facetune, modern shapewear, high-end gyms, and a revolution in skincare products, corporate workers can be their own glam teams. GLP-1s lure people with a seemingly simpler path to thinness than diet fads and Weight Watchers menu items. And because conventional beauty has never been more accessible, the expectation that the average worker attains it has perhaps never been higher.
These beauty secret regimens aren't secrets — no longer treatments just for those with pretty people jobs like modeling and acting, but touted by regular people with 9 to 5s all over TikTok, where office workers sit before the camera and show themselves doing multi-step skincare routines and complex makeup and morning routines. You, too, can have a perfect, poreless face like the people on your Instagram feed, if you're willing to invest.
And in a precarious job market notoriously frosty to older workers, what better to justify that investment than thinking being hot can advance your career?
The rise of remote work let workers trade pinching shoes and tailored pants for slippers and sweats worn out of frame, but it also forced desk workers' faces in front of unforgiving cameras daily.
That meant confronting a mirror of their own image and imperfections while trying to focus on meetings. A study published in the Aesthetic Surgery Journal in 2021 found that more than one-third of participants in Australia started to negatively judge parts of their appearance after spending more time on video calls during the height of the pandemic. A survey of dermatologists published in 2021 in International Journal of Women's Dermatology found that more than half of practitioners reported an increase in cosmetic consultations, with more than 80% of patients citing concerns with their appearance on video calls. Data from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) shows that cosmetic surgery procedures increased by 19% from 2019 to 2022, and have continued to climb at a slower rate since.
Beyond COVID, age-old ageism and workplace pressure also drive people toward cosmetic procedures, C. Bob Basu, president of ASPS, tells me in an email. ""Many patients tell us they want to look 'less tired,' 'more energetic,' or 'more alert' — especially in leadership roles, client-facing environments, or fast-paced industries where confidence and presence matter,"" Basu says. These people often focus on their faces and necks, engaging in procedures that lessen under-eye bags, lift eyelids, or lead to sharper jaw lines, Basu says. While the workplace is ""rarely the sole driver"" behind a cosmetic procedure, he says do weigh it in their choice, and that many patients cite watching themselves on video calls as the inciting incident.
Alanna Barry, a 30-year-old working in public relations, says that after staring at herself on screen for months, she became fixated on her teeth. Sometimes, when she smiled, the light in the room would hit them in a way she felt accented their imperfections. She's looking to pay out of pocket for Invisalign to get the smile she wants — to feel more confident herself, and so that energy comes off when speaking to clients. But she also feels that having a perfect smile could make her more memorable. ""My confidence is just completely shot,"" Barry tells me. ""I do feel like there's a stigma that if you present yourself a certain way and you're more polished or you have less flaws that are visible, you tend to get better opportunities than someone who's maybe not looking their very best.""
LinkedIn has made looks a part of even the job seeking process by showing recruiters your face for roles that, in theory, shouldn't rely on looks at all. Now there are several companies offering ways to use real photos combined with to generate well-lit, flawless AI professional headshots — a glowing professional image previously only in reach for those who could pay photographers with good equipment and good lighting. With AI initially evaluating so many profiles for jobs it's become fitting for more to rely on AI to boost their online persona.
But with the mass adoption of AI as an image editor, people might start looking the same. AI editing ""tries to neutralize literally everything, and in that homogenization, what we get is a loss of individuality, and a loss of cultural diversity,"" says Gretchen Andrew, an artist who uses AI and oil painting in her pieces that comment on the highly filtered beauty standards. Bill Cava, who runs AI consulting firm Generative Labs, tells me he experimented with an AI version of himself. It created a more polished look — smoother skin, no gray hairs. But he says he learned from his clients' reactions that showing up deeply human and authentic was the better move. ""I was like, 'hey, that looks wonderful,'"" Cava tells me about seeing the AI version of himself. ""But my clients were like: ""No, please don't do that.'"" He realized that ""it seems to violate the trust"" he had with people.
Similar to minor dental work, it's some of the least invasive, low-lift cosmetic procedures that are growing in popularity. The ASPS says lip augmentation procedures have increased steadily year-over-year, growing from 1.38 million in 2022 to 1.45 million in 2024. The number of people using injectables like Botox has nearly doubled between 2019 and 2024, from just over 5 million to nearly 10 million. The global beauty industry, currently valued at $450 billion, is expected to reach a $590 billion valuation by 2030, according to a 2025 analysis from McKinsey, with skincare making up some 40% of the market.
Even people who oppose the role looks play in the workplace find themselves drawn to manipulating their image. Maureen Wiley Clough, who hosts the podcast ""It Gets Late Early"" about ageism in white-collar America, tells me she got Botox for the first time after watching herself on a screen and obsessing over lines on her face she hadn't noticed much before. She quit Botox about a year ago, after she became worried about possible long-term effects. Wiley Clough is an advocate for breaking down age-based barriers in the workforce, yet still found herself judging lines on her face. ""Aging is something that you think happens to other people,"" she says. ""I wasn't ready for it.""
The workplace benefits of pretty aren't just a perception — there's data to show more attractive workers earn more. A study published in 2023 that found attractive MBA holders earn 2.4% more than other MBA graduates, and that the prettiest people can earn $5,500 more annually. The study used machine learning models trained to evaluate the attractiveness, and found that the benefit of good looks persists throughout a career, not just for young interviewees. ""It's not that they are only benefiting right in the beginning, in the quick interview with their MBA program, but the benefit actually persists five years, 10 years, into their career as well,"" Nikhil Malik, a marketing professor at the University of Southern California and lead author of the study, tells me. Another surprising finding: ""It matters as much for men as it does for women.""
High-powered men in tech are increasingly getting facelifts. Men now make up 7% of plastic surgery patients, according to ASPS. ""While certainly less controversial or stigmatized thanks to social media and other trends, men's pursuit of cosmetic surgery may be a way to get a leg up in an uncertain economy,"" the society's 2024 report says. ""An increasingly competitive job market may be fueling renewed interest for men in aesthetic health because it offers an opportunity for men to improve their confidence.""
The boom in GLP-1 use for weight loss (some 12% of Americans say they are currently using the drugs, according to health research firm KFF) has only furthered perceptions that people can and should be thin, says Ally Duvall, senior program development lead at Equip, a startup focused on eating disorder treatment. The Society for Human Resource Management surveyed about 1,000 human resource professionals in 2023 and found that about a quarter said obese employees are more likely to be perceived as unmotivated and lazy than slimmer workers. And fear of missing out on your job due to your size is realistic — weight-based discrimination is legal in much of the US. While workplaces celebrate diversity of race, sexuality, or religion, they rarely touch on body size. Duvall says weight stigma may seem justified at work, because some people inaccurately link thinness with health.
""If you aren't doing things about it, then you're morally wrong, or you're a bad person, or you're not taking your life seriously, or you're not doing the things that you should in order to achieve this most successful life out there,"" Duvall says people may think about larger workers to justify their bias.
Work isn't the sole motivator for many who want to control their appearance. Reynolds tells me it's not just for her PR firm — wants to look good and feel good for herself. She's confident about her abilities, and proud of the hard work she did to get to a place of expertise. Despite her accomplishments, it feels like her work could slip away. ""Now, I have to reverse age to stay here,"" Reynolds tells me. ""Why is the window so short to be professionally relevant?""
Ageism, weight stigma, and pretty privilege are some of the hardest biases to dismantle; doing so requires unraveling the conscious and subconscious ways we've come to value and interpret beauty over a lifetime, and also confronting aging and mortality without fear. We're typically our own harshest critics, but there's enough evidence to wonder if others are critiquing our looks alongside our resumes, too.
""If people think that they can get further in their career by throwing some Botox in their forehead, they're going to keep doing it,"" says Wiley Clough. ""The sad part is, in many ways, I think they're probably not wrong.""

Black Friday may be officially over, but gaming deals haven't completely vanished yet. (A lot of the best tech deals are still available, too.) This year's discounts have been especially strong across the board, with big price cuts on PlayStation and Nintendo Switch hardware, games and accessories — and PC gamers haven't been left out either. We're still seeing some standout post-Black-Friday gaming laptop deals, with savings as high as 28% on popular lines from Asus ROG, Acer Nitro and Alienware.
A quick dose of realism, though: If your upgrade plans involve adding more RAM, recent memory price jumps could complicate things. That’s exactly why the remaining deals feel even more urgent: You’re locking in solid specs now, before component prices drift higher. Bottom line: Grab what’s still in stock while you can. Once we move past Cyber Monday, the best gaming discounts are usually the first to disappear.
Amazon
Just because you're into gaming doesn't mean you need to drop thousands on a laptop. Acer's Nitro V lineup includes several models with varying screen sizes and computing power starting at under $600, so you can find one that fits both your needs and your budget. This one has an upgraded i7 processor, an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050 GPU, 1TB SSD, 16GB of RAM and is currently sitting at its lowest price ever.
Amazon
This laptop is absolute overkill if all you're doing is checking email — but if you want a machine that can crush modern games, this is the one. It's not the lightest out there at nearly 6 pounds and the design isn't exactly what I'd call understated, but under the hood, it's all power: an i7 processor, an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060, 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. The 1920x1200 165Hz display is icing on the cake — sharp, smooth and a standout at this price.
Amazon
Yes, this older Nitro V model revs down the specs a bit — but pairs that with a dip in the pricetag, too. It’s still a formidable gaming competitor, with a dedicated NVIDIA graphics card, half a terabyte of SSD storage and a nearly 16-inch screen.
Amazon
Now we’re talking: With an Intel Core i7, newish RTX 5060 GPU and 16GB of RAM paired with a full terabyte of SSD storage, this Alienware Aurora has room to grow with your future gaming needs — and at just under $1,100, it’s priced right, too.
Note that some (but not all!) of these deals are available at Amazon. If you have Amazon Prime, you'll get free shipping, of course. Not yet a member? No problem. You can sign up for your free 30-day trial here. (And by the way, those without Prime still get free shipping on orders of $35 or more.)

44,2025-11-30,"The Temora Flyers described the pilot's death as a ""tragic loss""
Charlotte Phillipp is a Weekend Writer-Reporter at PEOPLE. She has been working at PEOPLE since 2024, and was previously an entertainment reporter at The Messenger.
7NEWS Australia/Youtube
 A pilot in Australia has died after his plane was involved in a mid-air collision with another plane.

 According to a statement from police in New South Wales, emergency services were first called to the site of the crash near Napperfield Airfield, a private airport located in the Sydney suburb of Wedderburn, at around 12:15 p.m. local time on Sunday, Nov. 30.

 Two small planes collided in mid-air, before one of the aircraft crashed into a rural area.

 ""Responding emergency services located the body of the pilot, believed to be the sole occupant of the aircraft,"" police said. ""The other plane landed safely at the airfield, and the pilot was uninjured.""

 9News and the Daily Mail reported that the deceased has been identified as Eddie Seve, an aerobatic pilot.

 Seve, who founded the Freedom Formation Display Team — Australia's largest civilian formation team, according to the organization's social media pages — was flying in a four-plane formation when he collided with another aircraft, the Daily Mail reported.Flight radar data obtained by the outlets showed that Seve's amateur-built Van's Aircraft RV-7 plane left the airport just after 11:40 a.m. and travelled east.

 The aircraft briefly flew over the ocean and turned back toward the airport before it crashed into the other plane, which was also an RV-7 — a two-seater, single-engine plane.

 A witness who spoke with The Daily Telegraph said that while Seve's plane was severely damaged in the crash, the other aircraft ""only lost a wheel.""

 ""The other plane got chopped with the prop, and then the fuselage parted, and it came down,"" the witness said, recalling how the planes had been flying closer together before impact. ""It sounded like someone landed on my hangar — it was so loud.""

 ""They were doing formation, they were so close together,"" he added. ""One guy pulled away first, and the other guy followed, and then it happened.""

 The second airplane landed safely back at the airport, and its pilot was unharmed.

 According to The Daily Telegraph, Seve, from Sydney's Hills District, was a highly respected and experienced pilot and recently flew with his aerobatic group at the Gold Coast Airshow.

 The Temora Flyers released a statement soon after the incident, sharing that it was acknowledging ""the tragic loss of a pilot involved in an aircraft accident earlier today.""

 ""The pilot who passed was a highly respected member of the formation team and a strong supporter of youth in aviation. Their contribution to inspiring young people and promoting safe, professional flying will not be forgotten,"" the organization wrote on Facebook.

 ""Temora Flyers Inc. extends our heartfelt condolences to the pilot's family, friends, and all who are grieving during this difficult time,"" the statement continued.

 Police noted that the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) has opened an investigation into the incident.

 “Investigators will also interview the other pilots involved in the formation flight, as well as other witnesses and involved parties,” the ATSB told 7News.

Have you ever wondered why manhole covers are round instead of square? Or who invented the steamroller? Or why giant steel coils are transported on their sides instead of flat?
Sure, you can do a simple Google search to find out. But what you really might need is a video set to an AI-generated song that sounds like Taylor Swift if she went through a messy breakup with construction equipment.
A post shared by Learning with Lyrics! (@learningwithlyrics)
This is Learning with Lyrics, which has an Instagram account with 900,000 followers and a TikTok account with 548,000 followers. I kept coming across these videos, so I did some investigating: I was surprised to find that a 21-year-old marketing major at California State University in Long Beach was behind the account.
It's an illustration of what someone with an idea and access to off-the-shelf AI tools can make these days. It's pretty fascinating.
""I've always been someone who's curious about stuff,"" Cashen Tomlinson told me about his inspiration for starting the channels, which launched in September. Tomlinson said he loved videos about how things were made, and came up with the idea to make some of his own, setting them to songs.
A post shared by Learning with Lyrics! (@learningwithlyrics)
Tomlinson comes up with the ideas for the subjects of the videos: like how vending machines detect fake coins, how Post-it Notes work, or what causes airplane contrails. Then, he gets to work — with AI at his side.
""I use AI to generate a detailed research brief on the topic at hand, then I personally verify everything to ensure my facts are 100% correct,"" he said.
Then, that's where the catchy songs come in. He instructs Google's Gemini to create a rough draft of the lyrics. ""The real work during the lyrics creation is the polish, where I rewrite all the hooks, simplify or reword complex terms, reduce wordiness and increase clarity, ensure the outro is memorable, etc.,"" he said.
Tomlinson then uses the AI music generator tool Suno to produce a song — often the same melody for different videos, with the sound of an AI-generated female vocalist.
For the visuals, he uses a mix of stock footage, his own custom animations, and video clips he generates with AI tools like Veo or Sora.
And yes, the girl in the profile image for the @LearningwithLyrics social accounts is also AI-generated.
i’m so very anti AI but her songs are getting GOOD #ai #comedy #fyp #learningwithlyrics
Tomlinson told me it usually takes him two or three hours to make the song, and about 5 hours total for each video. So far, he says he's made a few thousand dollars through the TikTok creator rewards program, which was thrilling for a college kid.
While it may seem, at first glance, that these videos are aimed at children, Tomlinson says his main audience is 25-to 35-year-olds.
The comment sections show a devotion to the catchy songs. Some samples: ""This is my favorite Taylor Swift song"" (of course, it's not her), and ""How do I download this to my phone and listen to it on repeat forever?""
I watched one video about steel coils #learnwithlyrics #steelcoil #icecreamsandwich 
It's hard to describe exactly what's so fun about these videos. Sure, they're catchy, and ""How it's made"" videos have always had an appeal. But there's something about the AI voice that takes it to a level where you can't totally tell if it's ironic or not.
Tomlinson doesn't think of this as brainrot, however. ""I think the reason you might call it [brainrot] is because it's so captivating and you can't really look away from it,"" he said. ""But I think it's kind of good that these videos are something you can't look away from, because it's something that's actually teaching you something interesting.""

	Two veteran producers, Singapore’s Leonard Lai and Vietnam’s Hang Trinh, are spearheading the launch of a $3M investment venture, Triple Green CineCapital (TGC), to finance and produce commercially-driven features for the fast-growing Southeast Asian market. 

	The launch is being announced today at JAFF Market, which is running alongside the Jogja-NETPAC Asian Film Festival (JAFF). 

	TGC is targeting to raise $3M by 2029 through an investment structure “designed for transparency, high returns, and streamlined participation for global investors”. The founders said the move was driven by the demographics in Southeast Asia, which has one of the world’s youngest media-consuming populations and a growing appetite for local-language theatrical hits.

	“Southeast Asia is the third most populous region in Asia, making it one of the most high-potential film markets in the world,” said Lai, adding that the company’s strategy includes investments in film production, acquisition and distribution, sponsorship and “regional incentive optimisation”.




			Watch on Deadline		






	Lai has previously produced 21 feature films including multiple titles from Singapore’s highest-grossing franchise, Ah Boys To Men, which collectively generated more than $40M in box office revenue. Five of his titles rank among the top ten box office films in Singapore.

	Working across distribution and international sales, Hang Trinh’s Skyline Media has handled around 500 releases across cinema and digital platforms in Vietnam, as well as overseas distribution of more than 80 Vietnamese films in over 32 territories. Her investment portfolio has delivered returns of up to 40% with titles released across Asia, North America, Australia and Europe. 

	“Vietnam is growing fast, but it is also a tricky market for international investors,” said Hang Trinh.

	The TGC founders said their model promises a “simplified, investor-friendly process built around quarterly project tracking, shareholder voting, structured deal transparency, and regular financial reporting”. 

	










	The venture will target high-performing regional genres including commercial action, thriller, horror, family drama, romantic comedy, animation and adaptations – formats that are consistently driving strong returns across film markets in Southeast Asia.

Roborock makes a lot more than just the high-end flagship $1000+ models that get a lot of attention in tech reviews and forums for fans. The brand makes cheaper models that still have important features like self-emptying docks and these are some of the best value options on the robot vacuum market.
For instance, the Q7 M5+ has 10,000Pa of suction, two brushes that don’t tangle, LiDAR navigation and a base that empties itself and holds up to seven weeks of debris – and it costs a lot less than some flagship models. The good news is that Amazon has just cut the price of this combo to $219 for Cyber Monday, down from its usual price of $359 and this is the lowest price ever.
See at Amazon
The RockDock Plus base station automatically empties the robot’s dustbin into a sealed bag that holds about seven to nine weeks’ worth of dirt, pet hairÂ and other debris, depending on how big your home is and how messy it is. Because of that extra space, you can basically forget about taking care of your vacuum for almost two months.
Instead of emptying dustbins after every cleaning session, you can just check in every so often to change bags. The sealed bag system keeps allergens and fine dust particles from getting into the air when you empty it by hand and it makes it perfect for homes with allergies or sensitivities. When the bag is full, you can quickly lift it up and put it back down again without making dust clouds or having to touch the dirt that has built up.
The 10,000Pa HyperForce suction picks up everything from fine dust on hardwood floors to pet hair that has been stuck in carpets without needing to go over the same area more than once: That level of suction is comparable to models that cost twice as much, and it works well on all types of floors. Roborock made the dual anti-tangle system with JawScrapers’ main brush technology which stops hair from getting stuck in the roller and it also has a side brush that won’t get tangled even when cleaning up long human hair or shedding from double-coated dogs.
PreciSense LiDAR navigation makes precise floor plans of your home and shows where rooms and furniture are so that you can clean them more quickly. Unlike older models, this vacuum doesn’t bump around your space at random and instead, it follows planned paths that make sure it covers everything without going over the same area more than once. You can also use the Roborock app to set no-go zones so that the vacuum doesn’t go near pet food bowls, delicate rugs, or places with cables. Virtual walls make boundaries without needing to put up physical barriers.
This combination vacuum and mop can pick up both dry and sticky messes in one pass: It automatically switches between modes based on the type of floor and your preferences. With three adjustable water flow settings, you can choose how much water to use when mopping. For example, you can use light moisture on sealed hardwood or heavier flow on tile and laminate that can handle more water.
The vacuum works just as well on carpets as it does on hard floors because it automatically adjusts the suction power when it detects rugs or carpets and lowers it on hard surfaces to save battery life. The edge cleaning works well because the side brush can get into corners and along baseboards where dirt builds up. The design is small enough to fit under furniture and around chair legsÂ which lets it get to places that upright vacuums can’t.
For $219, you can get the Roborock Q7 M5+ with its self-emptying dock and it is a great deal because similar systems from iRobot or Shark usually cost between $400 and $600. Here you can get a robot vacuum system that makes it easy to keep your floors clean every day.

Can everyone dial it down a little with the enthusiasm for humanoid robots that canât even do anything useful yet? Youâre scaring the Chinese economy.
On Thursday, three Bloomberg reporters based in Beijing reported on an usual government announcement from Chinaâs economic central planning department, the National Development and Reform Commission (it has no U.S. equivalent, so donât even ask): the commission had noticed a pattern of dozens upon dozens of Chinese firms pushing out humanoid robots that do essentially nothing, and do it in pretty much the same way.
Agency spokeswoman Li Chao, Bloomberg said, expressed worry that this wave of robots was in danger of steering smart people away from actual, valuable research.
China seems to be noticing what youâve probably already noticed: news stories about flashy Chinese robots walking really far, competing in games, and insufficient hype about Chinaâs incomparably vast army of factory worker robots.
Chinaâs version of this trend apparently kicked off when the country watched an admittedly kickass dance performance by a squadron of Unitree bots at the 2025 Spring Festival Gala, a Chinese New Year broadcast that happens to be the single most watched TV event in the world.
Per Bloombergâs quoting of Li, âFrontier industries have long grappled with the challenge of balancing the speed of growth against the risk of bubblesâan issue now confronting the humanoid robot sector as well.â It amounts to a not-so-veiled announcement that the state thinks youâre potentially jeopardizing stability if youâre making these things in China.
Bike-sharing apps formed an economic bubble in China, for instance. There were dozens of apps that all did the same thing. Then that bubble disastrously popped, creating embarrassing photo spreads of bike graveyards, serving forever as examples of economic speculation gone mad.
And China is famous for tossing its tech billionaires behind barsâeach arrest serving as a potential object lesson to any humanoid robot company CEO thinking about flouting what the Chinese government now says it wants to see: fewer robo-firms.
Bloomberg summarized what Li said the remarkable next steps would be: the government will on one hand expand R&D, and build national infrastructure for testing and training robots, efforts apparently aimed at injecting some much-needed variety into the sector. But It will also apparently create formal rules for entering and exiting the robot market, apparently to tamp down uncreative knock-offs.
So the Chinese robots aren’t going away. But if your product is in the video below, maybe you should consider yourself on notice.

54,2025-11-30,"“The crew then had the biggest guys on the plane sit next to her just in case she got physical,” said a witness, who shared a clip from her perspective on TikTok
Getty
 A viral TikTok shows an upset traveler cursing at a flight attendant after boarding a plane that allegedly sat on the tarmac for more than an hour.

 TikTok user @haleyrose99, a fellow passenger on the flight at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, shared the video on Nov. 10 — and it has since accumulated nearly 500,000 views as of Nov. 30.

 ""This woman went absolutely nuts and we had to return back to the gate to remove her,"" she wrote in the caption. 

 The video began with two cooperative passengers quietly being escorted from their seats and down the aisle. The third woman in the row then stood up and a flight attendant blocked her from leaving the area. 

 ""I’m getting up. I’m allowed to stand up. When you keep us on the tarmac for an hour, I’m allowed to stand up,” the woman said to the flight attendant, before continuing her response with curse words. “Really not a problem for me to want to f------ stand. F------ c----.""

Getty
 The traveler was shown looking to the side and seeing the person recording her from another row. She stared at the camera for a moment, and then looked away and shook her head. 

 Newark International Airport did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment on Nov. 30.

 The TikToker also shared an update to explain what else happened.

 She said the plane was headed to Charleston, S.C., on Nov. 9, describing the incident as ""truly one of the wildest traveling experiences I’ve ever had.""

 She claimed the flight was delayed for three hours, and then after boarding, the plane was held on the tarmac for about an hour and a half. The passengers were then allegedly told that the plane was ""number 30 in line and we have another hour and a half wait.""

 ""So at this point, everyone’s just over it. You can feel the collective exhaustion. And then this woman just loses it and starts screaming the c-word over and over and over again. And everyone goes silent,"" she said. 

 The TikTok user said another woman tried to calm the upset traveler down, but it did not work. The upset passenger ""started spiraling"" when the two women next to her were moved out of the row, according to the TikToker.

 ""The crew then had the biggest guys on the plane sit next to her just in case she got physical. And once we returned to the gate, she was escorted off. She put her sunglasses on and started going, ‘Thank god,’ ” she recalled. 

 ""The flight attendants were actually angels. Everybody stayed calm,"" she added.

 According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, there are many reasons for flight delays, such as bad weather and mechanical issues. Delays considered controllable by the airline include maintenance or crew problems, cabin cleaning, baggage loading and fueling.

 A pilot told PEOPLE in November that passengers getting up when a plane gets delayed at a gate can cause even more delays, even if they’re just going to the bathroom.
""When that happens, we're up in the front trying to get clearance to push back to start getting things going,"" Republic Airways pilot Rob Donnelly said. ""But whenever a passenger gets up to use the bathroom, we are not supposed to move the plane.""

MicroStrategy CEO Phong Le has, for the first time, acknowledged that the company could sell its 649,870 BTC holdings under specific crisis conditions. 
This marks a significant shift from Chairman Michael Saylor’s long-standing “never sell” philosophy and signals a new chapter for the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder.
MicroStrategy has confirmed a scenario almost no one thought possible: the potential to sell Bitcoin, its core treasury asset. Speaking on What Bitcoin Did, CEO Phong Le outlined the precise trigger that would force a Bitcoin sale:
JUST IN: Strategy CEO Phong Le says $BTC would only be sold if the company’s stock falls below net asset value and funding options disappear, calling it a financial decision. pic.twitter.com/YpgEIeF3qe
Le clarified that the board has not planned near-term sales, but confirmed that this option “is in the toolkit” if financial conditions deteriorate.
This is the first explicit acknowledgement, after years of Michael Saylor’s absolutist claim that “we will never sell Bitcoin.” It shows that MicroStrategy does, in fact, have a kill-switch tied directly to liquidity pressure.
mNAV compares MicroStrategy’s market value to the value of its Bitcoin holdings. When mNAV drops below 1, the company becomes worth less than the Bitcoin it owns.
Several analysts, including AB Kuai Dong and Larry Lanzilli, note that the company is now facing a new constraint. The mNAV premium that powered its Bitcoin-accumulation flywheel has nearly vanished for the first time since early 2024. 
As of November 30, mNAV hovers near 0.95x, edging uncomfortably close to the 0.9x “danger zone.”
If mNAV falls below 0.9x, MicroStrategy could be pushed toward BTC-funded dividend obligations. Under extreme conditions the firm would be compelled to sell portions of its treasury to maintain shareholder value.
🧵 MicroStrategy CEO Phong Le just confirmed on What Bitcoin Did (Nov 29, 2025):😯 “If MSTR stock trades <1x mNAV AND we can’t raise fresh capital → we would sell portions of our #Bitcoin as a last-resort move.”🤔 He called it “mathematically justified” to protect Bitcoin…
The pressure stems from $750–$800 million in annual preferred share dividend payments, issued during MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin expansion. 
Previously, the company used new equity issuances to cover these costs. With the stock down more than 60% from its highs and market skepticism rising, that avenue is narrowing.
According to Astryx Research, MicroStrategy has effectively transformed into a “leveraged Bitcoin ETF with a software company attached.” That structure works when BTC rises, but amplifies stress when liquidity tightens or volatility spikes.
Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin Strategy: Genius or Hidden Risk?@saylor and MicroStrategy have done something no public company in history has ever done:They turned their balance sheet into a leveraged Bitcoin ETF with a software company attached — and it has paid off massively.… pic.twitter.com/KfAMJYWB7y
SEC filings have long warned about liquidity risk during a deep Bitcoin drawdown. While the firm maintains that it faces no forced liquidation risk due to its convertible debt structure, the CEO’s latest comments confirm a mathematically defined trigger for voluntary sales.
If $BTC drops to our $74K average cost basis, we still have 5.9x assets to convertible debt, which we refer to as the BTC Rating of our debt. At $25K BTC, it would be 2.0x.
MicroStrategy is the largest corporate BTC holder in the world. Its “HODL forever” stance has been a symbolic pillar of the institutional Bitcoin thesis. Acknowledging a sell condition, even if distant, shifts that narrative toward realism:
Investors will watch Monday’s updates closely as analysts track whether mNAV stabilizes or continues slipping toward 0.9x. 
Any further weakness in BTC or MSTR stock could intensify scrutiny of MicroStrategy’s balance sheet strategy heading into 2026.

Just about everything is becoming more expensive these days, and car repairs are no exception. If you’re in the market for a new vehicle, it’s crucial to weigh the costs of potential future repairs before making a purchase, especially if you intend to drive the car after it reaches 100,000 miles.
Be Aware: I’m a Car Expert: — 3 Luxury Cars That Cost More To Fix Than They’re Worth
Check Out: 6 Safe Accounts Proven To Grow Your Money Up To 13x Faster
Even the most well-maintained car will need repairs eventually, but some models are far pricier to fix than others. We’ve done the homework for you and put together a list of cars with the most expensive repairs after the 100,000-mile mark.
Estimated cost for maintenance and repairs in first 10 years of service: $20,136
Range Rovers have a reputation as high-performance vehicles, so they may not need repairs as frequently as other vehicles, but when they do, the repairs can be costly.
The main factor behind why repairs are expensive is the price of the vehicle parts. Land Rover manufactures its Range Rovers with high-quality parts and advanced technology, which naturally carry a higher price tag. Not to mention, as your Range Rover surpasses 100,000 miles and gets older, replacement parts become harder to find, which drives prices up even higher.
“The Range Rover tends to have problems with major systems after the first 100,000 miles,” said Melanie Musson, auto industry expert with AutoInsurance.org. “The timing chain may need to be replaced which will cost over $5,000. The air suspension often fails after 100,000 miles, and will cost a couple of thousand dollars to repair.”

Estimated cost for maintenance and repairs in first 10 years of service: $12,685
Mercedes S-Class vehicles are built to last, so when you spend over $100,000 to buy one, you can expect to drive it over the 100,000-mile mark. Like the Range Rover, though, a well-manufactured vehicle is not cheap to fix. Expect to pay thousands of dollars when you eventually need to repair things like the sunroof motor, air conditioning expansion valves or water pumps.
“The S Class is an expensive vehicle to maintain, especially as it ages,” said Musson. “It requires specialty repairs with parts that cost a lot of money. German-made vehicles tend to have some good qualities that owners find attractive, but some of those benefits end up causing problems. For example, the vehicle’s advanced safety features often start to glitch after 100,000 miles. Even routine oil changes cost more than average.”
Estimated cost for maintenance and repairs in first 10 years of service: $20,000
The Porsche Macan is ranked high on the list of luxury SUVs to own, but it does come with expensive repairs.
Many owners complain about transmission issues, which carry an estimated $2,000 price tag to fix, and transfer case failures, which are even more expensive to replace. Carbon buildup in the engine of the Macan is another major concern, especially for those with over 100,000 miles.
It’s safe to say that if you’re planning on driving your Macan for an extended number of miles, be prepared to pay for it.
Estimated cost for maintenance and repairs in first 10 years of service: $19,514
Having a BMW on our list likely doesn’t come as a surprise. The BMW X5 may be another high-performing luxury SUV, but just like the other vehicles on the list, its repairs do not come cheap. Expect to pay above-average prices for new tires, brake repairs and technology issues.
Estimated cost for maintenance and repairs in first 10 years of service: $13,351
The final vehicle on our list with notoriously expensive repair costs after 100,000 miles is the Audi Q8. It’s another luxury SUV known for its high performance, but it still may have issues over time. Owners can expect to spend thousands of dollars on repairs to fix engine issues, transmission problems and technology glitches.

63,2025-11-30,"I've rounded up reliable microSD cards in various sizes to give your Steam Deck the space it deserves for your favorite games.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

The entry-level Steam Deck recently went on sale for the first time in Black Friday history. However, this model only features a minuscule internal SSD of 256GB, which is simply not enough to contain the vast majority of games these days.
So, we have rounded up the best Cyber Monday discounted microSD cards to give your newly minted entry-level Steam Deck the storage it needs to store and play the best PC games out there.
Sunday, Nov. 30 @ 1:00 PM ET: Checked store links and added backlinks to a Docking Station for Steam Cyber Monday discount round-up — Alexander Cope, Contributor.
Upgrade your Steam Deck with 1TB of extra storage space and ensure your games load faster with 180MB/s reading speeds.
This is the second-best option for upgrading Steam Deck storage space while keeping your budget mostly intact. It features 512GB of storage and modest read/write speeds up to 160MB/s.
The 2TB SanDisk Extreme is one of the most premium UHS-I microSDs out there. It's designed to provide maximum storage space while offering exceptionally high read speeds of 240MB/s and write speeds of 140MB/s.
While the 512GB SanDisk Ultra has slightly lower read/write speeds of 150MB/s compared to the 5126GB Samsung Evo Select's read/write speeds of 160MB/s, the former microSD can serve as a good backup option should the latter microSD run out of stock.
This is the 256GB edition of the SanDisk Extreme microSD that maintains a good fraction of the 2TB edition's reading speeds at 190MB/s, at a budget-friendly price.
If some of these microSDs run out of stock on Amazon, or you prefer shopping at other retailers, here are some alternative discounts sold elsewhere.
We also have a collection of essential Steam Deck accessories on sale and a round-up of discounted Docking Stations to complement the Steam Deck for you to peruse through.

UHS-1 means Ultra-High Speed, and it's a classification for microSD memory cards with a base transfer speed of 104MB/s. While their transfer speeds aren't as high as the more modern UHS-II microSDs, UHS-1 microSDs are easier to find, and the Steam Deck only supports the capabilities of UHS-1 cards.
UHS-II microSDs are backwards compatible with Steam Deck, but their base 312MB/s transfer speeds will be downgraded to UHS-I's base transfer speed levels of 104MB/s.
MicroSDs are often cheaper than internal SSDs, and they're easier to install onto a Steam Deck. This is because you only need to insert a microSD into a Steam Deck's microSD card slot to activate it. 
Whereas with internal SSDs, you need to take the Steam Deck apart to replace it, and if you're not skilled with manually messing with electronics, you can risk breaking it.
Black Friday started on Friday, November 28, 2025, but retailers have been hosting discount sales early since the start of November and will continue to do so until December 1, 2025.
Cyber Monday is set to start on Monday, December 1, 2025, where electronic-focused products will be discounted for the day. However, retailers like Amazon have already begun switching from making Black Friday-themed bargains to Cyber Monday-themed ones that may extend days beyond December 1, 2025.

Some questions to consider as we approach a new year for the stock market:
What will the worst drawdown look like? Going back to 1928, the average peak-to-trough drawdown in a given calendar year is -16%.
That’s higher than it seems, right?
Drawdowns were worse than average in 2025 (-18.9%), 2022 (-25.4%) and 2020 (-33.9%). Peak-to-trough drawdowns were better than average in 2024 (-8.5%), 2023 (-10.3%) and 2021 (-5.2%).
Will 2026 look better or worse than that historical drawdown profile?
My guess is most investors assume 2026 will see losses of more than 16% at some point because of all the AI stuff.
We shall see.
How average will the returns be? Returns in a given year are rarely close to the long-term averages.
The typical year isn’t a return of 8-10% but rather a wide range of big gains or big losses:
The average up year tends to see stocks rise by 20% or so.
In fact, the S&P 500 has finished the year up 20% or more in roughly 4 out of every 10 years.
The average down year tends to see stocks fall by double-digits.
The 2020s are a perfect example of this wide range of returns. Here they are in order: +18%, +29%, -18%, +26%, +25% and +17% (so far).
What’s more likely — the long-term average (+10%) or the short-term average (+21% or -13%)?
And which short-term average — up or down?
Will the stock market finish the year down? Since 2020, the S&P 500 is up 5 out of 6 years.1
Since 2009, it’s up 15 out of the past 17 years.
Since 2000, the ratio of gains to losses is 20 to 6.
That’s pretty close to the long-term average over the past 100 years which is gains roughly 3 out of every 4 years.
Most of the time the stock market goes up. Yay!
Sometimes it goes down. Boo!
I guess these outcomes depend on your investment stance and human capital.
It’s important to recognize that historical relationships are not set in stone. There’s no guarantee past return profiles will remain in the future. That’s what gives the stock market a risk premium.
No one knows!
I believe this uncertainty is one of the reasons the stock market has a risk premium in the first place.
The stock market could experience huge gains again in 2026, or it could see enormous losses.
It’s also possible the market will go through a big drawdown on the way to big gains by the end of the year.
That’s normal too!
My financial ethos is based on the idea that you should build an investment plan that can withstand both the good times and the bad, the good years and the bad, the uptrends and the downtrends.
I don’t know what’s going to happen in 2026.
My best guess is that there will be some volatility, whether the market finishes up or down.

65,2025-11-30,"So many rooftop tents on the market weigh well over 100 lb (45 kg), with the heaviest pushing 300 lb (135 kg). The all-new Weekend from Danish camping goods company Groenberg shatters that mold and weighs in at a fraction of those figures. And for a limited time, it also prices in at a fraction of the competition, running closer to traditional ground tent pricing. Could this be the attainable, easy-to-use rooftop tent the market has been begging for? 
Rooftop tents (RTTs) offer a number of advantages over ground tents – a flat, cushioned sleeping surface up off the cold, rocky ground, a burlier construction than the average three-season ground tent, and faster, simpler setup at the campsite. 
For many campers, however, their rising four-figure prices, coupled with difficult mounting/demounting, completely obliterate any overall edge or value proposition compared to a regular tent. And that's before getting into other disadvantages like poor, fuel economy-dropping aerodynamics and a large, heavy storage footprint in the off-season. 
Mostly, though, it's that price. Are an RTT's advantages really worth 20+ times what a good, solid ground tent costs? Many outdoor enthusiasts continue to reply with a firm ""No,"" especially as prices are more regularly exceeding $5,000. 
Founded in 2016, Groenberg aims to couple distinctive individuality with traditional Scandinavian ""hygge"" in its lineup of camping products. While some of its older RTT models include a twist on conventional design, the all-new Weekend series really breaks from market norms. 
The entry level Weekend tent weighs in as little as 27.6 lb (12 kg), not including the ladder. Usually we prefer to list RTT weights with the ladder included, because it's both a necessary part of the package and one that folds away and stores all together with the rest of the tent atop the roof. But the Weekend is designed to pack and carry in a duffel bag, meaning the ladder carries separately and never needs to ride on the roof.
That said, the ladder adds an extra 12.1 lb (5.5 kg) to increase total carry weight to 39.7 lb (18 kg). The larger, roomier Weekend Comfort weighs in at 31 lb (14 kg) for just the tent and 43 lb (19.5 kg) with the ladder. Both figures are well lower than the 55-lb (25-kg) GentleTent Roof. The 25-lb (11.3 kg) C6 Outdoor Rev tent is actually a little lighter than the base Weekend tent but relies on a platform roof rack to essentially serve as its base panel – when packaged with its own panel, weight leaps to 73 lb (33 kg) total. 
All that lightness translates to convenience and a couple advantages most rooftop tents can't compete with. Instead of requiring multiple people to lift the tent and someone to secure it to the roof bars or platform rack via multiple bolt-on brackets, the Weekend tents set up on the ground like a cross between an inflatable and a pole-pitched ground tent. One person can simply inflate the TPU floor with the included hand pump and secure the collapsible aluminum pole set to the external hooks to pitch the fabric body. Then he or she can lift it up and onto the roof, with or without help from a second person. 
That inflatable TPU base saves serious weight over the hard platforms underpinning the vast majority of rooftop tents while providing a solid base to attach to the vehicle roof bars via the integrated lockable buckle straps, no tools required. It also allows the tent to pack down to a size of 31 x 19 x 16 in (75 x 48 x 40 cm) for storage and transport. 
In fact, the tent is not meant to remain mounted to the vehicle roof when driving, removing and packing away as easily as it set up. Of course, those who'd prefer to use their vehicle space for other cargo and passengers can pack the Weekend in a duffel bag and strap it to the roof, much like they might do with other luggage or cargo. 
In addition to saving weight by eliminating the hard floor, Groenberg furthers savings with a polyester ripstop construction that appears more similar to ground tents than to the heavy-duty poly/cotton canvas often featured in RTT construction. 
Inside, the Weekend offers a sleeping area of 87 x 51 in (220 x 130 cm) and a 47-in (120-cm) peak height that extends across much of the tent's length thanks to the dual-hoop frame. Vents at the front and rear ends provide airflow, even when campers batten the outer fabric down for rainy or windy conditions. 
The Weekend Comfort offers the same interior volume and sleeping area but comes with added features like rain canopies over the entries and two ""sky-view"" roof panels that can even open up so users can stand up for a better look at their surroundings. 
Both the Comfort and standard Weekend tents come with a telescopic ladder that extends to 7.5 feet (2.3 m) in length and compacts to 2.3 feet (70 cm), a hand pump, a repair kit, and an instruction manual. 
Groenberg is raising money on Kickstarter to see its Weekend RTT vision through to reality. It's slashed planned retail pricing in half for campaign pledge levels that start at €499 (approx. US$580) for the standard Weekend and €599 ($700) for the Weekend Comfort. Prices do not include shipping, which runs €20 to the EU, €50 to China and €110 to other parts of the world. Groenberg hopes to begin deliveries in February.

70,2025-11-30,"The most common valuation yardstick is the mNAV. It compares a company's enterprise value (EV) — which is a firm's market cap plus debt minus any cash — to the market value of its bitcoin holdings. This provides investors with a means to evaluate the extent to which the market assigns a premium or discount to its treasury.
The metric is now widely followed. Strategy publishes its own mNAV on its investor site, while third-party dashboards such as BitcoinTreasuries.net track various mNAV figures across multiple firms.
While the EV-based calculation simplifies the calculation of the metric, the ratio can shift significantly depending on how analysts treat debt, cash, and potential share dilution. This is why the industry now tracks multiple variants, including mNAV Basic, mNAV Diluted, and mNAV EV, each taking into account the shares and corporate structures of a company. 
However, for simplicity, sticking with the usual EV-based approach, a reading above 1.0 implies the market is putting a premium on the company's BTC treasury holdings, while a reading below 1.0 suggests a discount — potentially a red flag or an opportunity, depending on the investor's outlook.
For example, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net, as of Nov. 30, Strategy’s reported values were: mNAV Basic at 0.856, mNAV Diluted at 0.954 and mNAV EV is 1.105. These essentially mean that equity investors may be paying slightly less than $1 per dollar of BTC on a diluted basis, while the broader market, including debt holders, still values the firm above its BTC holdings.
Because mNAV is a dimensionless ratio, it allows comparisons across firms regardless of treasury size or share count. It also reflects broader market sentiment about whether investors trust the firm's overall strategy.
mNAV has real implications for capital markets activity. A firm trading above 1.0 can raise equity or debt at favorable terms and buy more bitcoin, effectively increasing its exposure. When mNAV drops, that playbook becomes harder or more dilutive.
Because of that feedback loop, mNAV influences how companies approach financing — and how investors assess the viability of bitcoin-first business models.
Due to the metric containing several assumptions made by analysts and investors, according to NYDIG Research, it may not be what it's been made out to be. 
In a June 2025 blog post, Greg Cipolaro, the global head of research at NYDIG, offered a sharp critique of mNAV as it’s commonly used. He argued the metric is “woefully deficient” for failing to reflect key balance sheet risks — especially assumptions about convertible notes.
Many analysts, Cipolaro noted, treat these convertibles as if they’re guaranteed to convert into equity. But if market triggers aren’t met, the notes might have to be repaid in cash, creating a refinancing risk that mNAV fails to capture.
Cipolaro also flagged that mNAV often ignores the value of the operating company (opco), which could be a source of hidden risk or upside. Instead of scrapping the metric, he suggested refining it to incorporate more robust modeling of capital structure and opco valuation.
Regardless of the criticism, mNAV remains the most widely cited metric for comparing bitcoin treasury stocks; however, critiques like Cipolaro’s suggest it may need an upgrade. Investors are increasingly calling for more transparency and standardization — especially as more firms adopt bitcoin-forward treasury strategies.
With bitcoin treasuries growing in number and complexity, the question is no longer just “what’s the multiple?” but “what’s actually in it?”

Cyber Monday deals are already live, which means I've been scouring the web to find the best deals you should take advantage of if you're in the market for a new PC right now. Frankly, I don't think we're going to find a more insane deal than this: 76% off HP's ProBook 4 G1i making it over $3,059 off while stocks last!
Sunday, November 30th, at 2:51 PM ET: Price has been reduced further from $1,139 to $989.00, which is now 76% off its (arguably inflated) original price of $4,048. - Daniel Rubino, Editor-in-Chief

The HP ProBook 4 G1i is one of HP's most powerful laptops on the market, with 32GB RAM (upgradable), the top-of-the-line Intel Core Ultra 7 255H, and an NVIDIA RTX 3050 GPU. It has a 16-inch 1080p display, and fingerprint reader to boot. It's a monster of a machine!
So, what's so special about the HP ProBook 4 G1i that makes it usually worth $4,000? Well, it's one of HP's top of the line professional grade laptops. It's usually designed for business use, featuring a large 16-inch 1080p display, paired with a full-sized keyboard and trackpad, complete with a number pad. It also comes with Windows 11 Pro instead of Home.
On the inside, it's powered by an Intel Core Ultra 7 255H, which is Intel's latest laptop chips, paired with 32GB DDR5 RAM and 1TB SSD storage, which will be more than enough for most people. This model also comes with dedicated graphics in the form of an NVIDIA RTX 3050 GPU, which is great for light gaming or creative work.
That Intel Core Ultra 7 has 16 cores and 16 threads, making it a powerhouse of a chip that will handle pretty much any task you throw at it. The best bit? It has two SODIMM slots, which means you can upgrade the 32GB RAM with your own sticks down the line, futureproofing it even further.
It also comes with all the ports, including a full-sized HDMI 2.1 port, two USB-A, two USB-C, a headphone jack, and an Ethernet port. It also has a fingerprint reader for quick logging in with Windows Hello.
Frankly, this laptop is now one I'd generally consider, given its usual price tag, but when it's just $989, it's suddenly very recommendable, given how much power and performance you're getting. Plus, you can tell everyone your laptop costs $4,000, even though you didn't have to pay that!

This is HP's top of the line professional grade laptop. It's designed for professionals who are conducting important business, data, or creative work, and is designed to be durable with a large display and plenty of power under the hood.
The ProBook 4 G1i packs an Intel Core Ultra 7 255H (16 cores, 16 threads), 32GB DDR5 RAM, 1TB SSD, and an NVIDIA RTX 3050 GPU. It’s essentially a workstation disguised as a laptop. It's also aimed at enterprise, which typically pays more upfront for longer-term support instead of consumers, though there is no reason why a consumer can't benefit from this laptop or deal.
Yes. It has two SODIMM slots, so you can swap or expand beyond the included 32GB, making it more future‑proof.
Light gaming, yes. The RTX 3050 GPU isn’t top‑tier, but it’s solid for casual play and creative workloads like video editing. A few years ago, the 3050 was your standard mid-range gaming GPU, so it should still be solid in 2025.
Professionals who need serious horsepower (developers, creatives, analysts) but don’t want to pay workstation prices. With this Cyber Monday deal, it’s suddenly accessible to everyday buyers.
Honestly, no. At $4,000, it’s overkill for most. But at $989, it’s a rare chance to snag workstation‑level specs at consumer pricing.

72,2025-11-30,"The company claims to have doubled rendering performance and had demos running at ICCAD 2025.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

A Chinese vendor has shown what it calls the only mass-produced Imagination DXD-architecture graphics card currently on the market. The unveiling took place at the recent ICCAD 2025 in Chengdu.
In a statement published on its website, Xiang Di Xian said the new card more than doubles the overall rendering performance of its predecessor, and ran a series of large-scale 3D graphics workloads throughout the event. The company also demonstrated digital-twin applications and next-generation techniques such as ray tracing and super-resolution.
This is one of the first public demonstrations of Imagination’s DXD architecture in production hardware. DXD is the company’s high-performance GPU IP aimed at desktops and cloud-gaming infrastructure. It introduces native DirectX support to Imagination’s roadmap and offers Feature Level 11_0 compliance, Vulkan, and OpenGL support, and a decentralized multicore design.
Imagination advertises 2.3 TFLOPS and 72 GTexel/s per core, along with a reported 2.25x uplift in per-core performance over its BXT family. Its multicore layout is intended to scale into higher-end products aimed at PCs, workstations, and cloud-gaming deployments.
While the company did not publish specifications for the GPU card and did not assign a model name in its announcement, it emphasized that the design is already in mass production. The ability to run complex 3D visualization workloads smoothly formed the core of its demonstration.
Imagination’s public documentation describes DXD as a raster-first architecture, while the closely related DXT mobile IP integrates hardware ray tracing. Xiang Di Xian highlighted ray tracing in its written announcement, but the company has not yet clarified whether it is using a customized configuration of DXD, integrating additional blocks, or adopting an extended version of the IP tailored for its market.
Although the announcement did not provide numerical performance data beyond the “more than double” claim, the focus on digital-twin workloads and 3D simulation aligns with Imagination’s own positioning. DXD includes virtualization features such as the HyperLane multi-context system, which allows multiple isolated workloads to run on a single GPU.

With no independent testing or shipping products outside China, many questions remain about software support and real-world performance. Its appearance at ICCAD, however, marks the first time a DXD-based graphics card has been publicly demonstrated, setting the stage for a clearer look once further details emerge.

When I moved out of my apartment in Brooklyn, New York, and into a house in a suburb on Long Island, I thought it was for the long haul.
Then COVID-19 hit.
Like many others during the pandemic, my husband and I took the time to consider our priorities. For us, that meant leaving our large commuter town outside New York City — and all of its expenses and conveniences — for a small, rural town in the Catskill Mountains, about three hours north.
We've always loved the Catskills for its outdoor activities, breathtaking landscapes, and quieter way of life. So, in January 2021, we sold our home on Long Island, New York, and relocated.
The town we left behind had a population of 25,000 people, thousands of homes, busy roadways, a town center with restaurants, bars, and businesses, and a train line that took us straight to Manhattan within 40 minutes. 
Our new town has a population closer to 1,600, excluding the deer, groundhogs, and bears.
There have been no regrets, but over the past almost five years, there have been a few surprises. Here are 12 things that surprised me after we moved.
Long Island's traffic is infamous. When living there, I would automatically factor in an additional 30 minutes when driving anywhere. And everyone knows driving is the worst way to get across New York City.
So, when I moved here, it was truly novel to me that I could enter an address into Google Maps, and it would actually take me that long to get there. I am never stuck in traffic, and I never have to factor in extra time.
Instead, our traffic concerns are a little different. Heavy snow makes traveling by car more precarious, although the snowplows are usually out in force when the first snowflake falls. Driving up the mountain when it's ringed with fog also requires me to take things a little slow.
Additionally, I need to be much more aware of wildlife on the roads and the dangers we present to each other.
Anyone who's tried to mail anything in New York City knows they have to set aside an hour and a good deal of patience for a visit to the post office.
Now, I just walk across the street and straight to the counter, where I'm met with warm smiles and quick service. I'm out within minutes.
Some processes are just much easier when you're contending with fewer people, and I'll never take that for granted.
In New York City or Long Island, my doctor was always an hour behind. By the time I was finally seen, I'd waited so long I felt forgotten—and the visit itself felt like it lasted only seconds.
On the other hand, my first medical-care experience here was like I'd seen in the movies — a scenario I'd previously dismissed as fiction. I was seen at my scheduled appointment time, and the doctor sat with me, looked me in the eyes, and discussed my concerns at length. Being treated with respect and patience by a doctor left me taken aback.
I've since had a child here, and the exceptional care continued throughout my pregnancy. The night I gave birth to my son, only one other child was born in the hospital, meaning there were multiple staff available in what felt like a stress-free environment.
That's not to say that simply practicing medicine here makes you an exemplary doctor, or that stellar doctors don't exist in the city. However, in my experience, the overwhelming demands of the city's population have had a detrimental impact on my care.
When we left Brooklyn for Long Island, we were drawn to the fact that our new suburban town was populated with people our age. But when we actually moved there, not knowing anyone, it was surprisingly hard to make friends. 
But here in the Catskills, we've been more successful. It's smaller, so we see the same people everywhere: in the coffee shops, on the trails, and at the farmers' markets. We meet new people and discover they know people we know, and it all just feels connected.
It's also far less transient than somewhere like New York City. People who live here might have done so for generations, and others have moved here with intention. It means people seem more willing to invest time in their neighbors and in the broader community because this is where they plan to stay.
Additionally, with its long, snowy winters and limited convenience, this lifestyle may not be suitable for everyone. So if you meet someone who lives here too, you know you already have some things in common.
While some people might not find this surprising, others might think it's a small-town myth. 
However, in my experience, everyone says hello to everyone, even if you don't know them or have never seen them before. I've become friends with many other residents this way.
It also means I can always tell when someone is visiting from out of town because they don't even try to make eye contact.
What I find particularly surprising about these interactions is that I love them. One of the things I enjoyed about living in New York City was the anonymity it afforded me. So I thought I would hate people recognizing me or knowing about my life, but the truth is, I love the sense of community and small shows of kindness.
Living in New York City means you can get anything practically any time of the day: Bodegas are still open in the early hours of the morning, bars don't close until late, and public transportation keeps ticking around the clock.
None of that is true here. We barely have public transportation — don't even think about getting an Uber — and it's almost an hour's drive from my house to the train station. The nearest supermarket is a 30-minute journey down the mountain, and I travel an hour to big-box stores to stock up on items like diapers.
I'm sure this aspect of living here would frustrate some people, but I don't mind it. There are a lot of positives to having less convenience. I turn errands into day trips. I plan meals better. I don't drink alcohol because I need to drive everywhere. I pass epic scenery just to get groceries. And I've gotten through a lot of audiobooks.
One factor behind our decision to move was the cost. For example. Now, our property taxes are a fraction of the cost — around a fifth of what they were on Long Island — despite having a larger property. Because of that, I naively thought everything would be cheaper here.
Still, with all the extra driving, I'm paying much more for gas and car maintenance. Our heating bills are about four times what they were on Long Island. Groceries in local stores can be more expensive because of the limited options and because they have to travel up the mountain. If we're having any service done at our home — getting a lock fixed, for example — we're often charged extra for the distance the technician has to travel.
Then, we also have expenses we didn't incur in Long Island or the city, such as paying to have our driveway plowed in the winter and paying for trash pickup.
Plus, with people like me moving here from cities, everything is becoming more expensive for residents who've lived here much longer. We're driving up property prices and causing a housing crisis for the locals and seasonal workers. 
So, while our area was perhaps once considered a cheaper option and affordable for many families, that isn't the case in reality now.
One reason our taxes are lower is because they don't cover services I've previously taken for granted, such as trash pickup. (Due to bears, we can't leave trash in cans overnight anyway.) Instead, residents take their trash to a local waste station, paying a couple of dollars per bag to dump it. Recycling is also available for free.
By comparison, our homes in New York City and its suburbs had robust sanitation departments that many people probably don't think twice about.
Access to other services can also be limited. We live close enough to our town's main street that we have access to fiber internet, and we're connected to the town's water mains. However, other residents rely on satellite internet, well water, and septic tanks, which require additional maintenance.
I grew up in the countryside, but still, I wasn't familiar with many of the wild animals I now regularly see here, such as porcupines, wild turkeys, skunks, snakes, hummingbirds, turkey vultures, and bears.
My favorites are the chunky groundhogs that waddle about town, and I've become overly invested in a family living in our backyard. The male groundhog has two families — one under the shed and one in the woods — and runs between the two. 
Who needs Netflix when you have this level of drama right in your backyard?
In winter, even the quickest errand in town requires pulling my microspikes over my boots to prevent slipping on the roads or sidewalks.
With temperatures hovering around 20 degrees Fahrenheit — and as low as -1 degree Fahrenheit — throughout the winter, I also wear two outer layers: a padded jacket underneath a larger coat. We've also invested in snowshoes for cross-country hikes after a heavy snowfall.
In summer, the weather is dry and hot, and the paths are dusty. I now look at the white sneakers, heeled shoes, and tailored coats in my closet with incredulity, wondering how I ever wore them.
While people are definitely stylish here, there's far less pressure — or expectation — to dress a particular way. Events are less formal; everyone understands we dress for practical purposes, not fashion.
New York City's pollution prevents much stargazing, and I spent so little time outside in the suburbs that I never noticed the stars there, either.
However, the night sky here is clear and breathtaking, and the view is uninterrupted by buildings, allowing you to appreciate the vastness.
In New York City, there were two seasons: bitterly cold, wet days, or sweaty, swelteringly hot days. Plus, I was rarely around nature, so I never noticed the seasons like I do now.
Here, every season is distinct. My first fall felt like I was experiencing fall for the first time. I'd never seen such vibrant colors for such a prolonged period.
Our winter is more extreme than in the city — we get multiple snowstorms each season, and the icicles are taller than me — and it lasts longer, too. But summer is gentler. It's hot but not unbearable, and none of it needs to be spent inside a subway car.
Other millennials who fled big cities during the pandemic have expressed regret over their decisions, but that has not been my experience.
I will never take it for granted that I wake up to views of towering mountains every day or have access to epic hikes just five minutes away. I love the seasons, the services, the people, and the stillness.
When I lived in the city and suburbs, I yearned to return to the countryside, and now that it has happened, I have no regrets.

“EU weighs Plan B for Ukraine as Belgium raises bar to unblock reparations loan”
The EU, especially Ursula, really want to get their hands on those frozen Russian assets. It’s like they plan to skim off a few billion for themselves before sending on the rest to the Ukraine or something. But for Belgium this is a problem. That Russian money is still parked in Belgium’s Euroclear. Now Euroclear is reckoned to have some €40.7 trillion in assets under their custody. Think about that. You are are talking about over US$47 trillion held there. And the EU wants Belgium to hand over that $300 billion to Zelensky of all people who is currently mired in a corruption scandal. If they did that then Belgium would be burning Euroclear down to the ground – and the Belgium economy with it – as all those assets would fly off to other continents. And to add insult to injury, none of the EU members will put themselves on the hook for that money by sharing the risk. Frankly Belgium should tell Ursula and the EU where to go and what they can do when they get there.
Trouble is you just can’t find an honest Nazi anywhere nowadays.
Those two tubs look like they would be perfect for a Money Laundry Room.
I can see why the amethyst tub has gold plated legs. It’s a weight versus strength of materials issue.
I once had the very nervous “honour” of installing a solid gold taps set on a guest bathroom hand sink in the Miami condo of a member of the House of Saud. The sink itself was carved from a single piece of orange onyx in the shape of a tulip. The walls and floor of the half bath room were three quarter thick 12″ X 12″ sheets of the same orange onyx. Gold, at least when nearly pure, (the items were mixed with something else for hardness,) is very, very soft. Almost anything will scratch it. Installing those taps was a minor technical challenge. Strap wrenches and brand new crescent wrenches were the order of the day. Oh, and remove anything that could scratch a surface from your person. Items like wrist watches, rings, zippers, etc. Now lay down towels all around the scene of the action.
Stay safe, with style.
That amethyst tub is nice to look at. I would have used bronze for the base frame and feet because it develops a nice patina. I can’t imagine gold plated surfaces age well in a humid bathroom environment.
Funny you should mention that.
I rented for 14 years a Brooklyn apartment from a guy who did plating, mostly gold, for top line aerospace devices.
Years before I moved in he plated the American Standard fixture set for the shower & bath and they looked exactly the same the day we moved out as they did when we moved in. Gold doesn’t really weather, it only scratches.
Thanks, I would not have expected that.
Gold doesn’t oxidize.  That’s why it’s great for electronic connections, and stays shiny forever so it looks pretty.
Otherwise it’s pretty useless.
Very low resistivity too.
Damn man, I can imagine how nervous you would have been. You would have been like a sniper where they draw in a breath, exhale it all out, and then get to work.
A number of those “most expensive” artifacts have been presented in this very site, and each time I felt disbelief in view of all the display of gawdiness, kitsch, or tastelessness (depending on the case). 
A curved amethyst bathtub on gold-plated antique-imitating legs? Is this a prop to represent Neron’s bathroom in a remake of “Quo vadis?”
Aren’t there any comparable objects out there, perhaps ruinously luxurious, but at least exhibiting refinement, elegance, beauty…?
If the tub were hand-carved by well-treated and well-paid craftsmen, it might be OK. What are the ultra-wealthy going to do with their money (perhaps fund more of these for public baths)? And what will all the sentient tool-users do with their time when everything is automated?
Re. the Sheiks place in North Miami; Dad asked the Lebanese factotum who was overseeing the project something to the effect of, where does he come off spending so much? The Lebanese didn’t hesitate a second, and replied: “What would you do with seven million dollars income, a week?” Dad stood there and picked his jaw up off of the floor, just like the Coyote in a Roadrunner cartoon. The opulence hidden away in that apartment was amazing.
“Trump declares airspace above Venezuela is to be closed entirely as he ramps up lethal strikes”
People are complaining that Trump has no legal authority to close the airspace of another country with an implied threat to shoot down passenger airliners. But little do people know that in the US Constitution, which makes Trump the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, there is obscure clause which the Founding Fathers put in which also makes him the head of the Venezuela National Institute of Civil Aviation thus giving him legal power.
Of course if Trump does launch an aerial attack on Venezuela, not having so many civil airliners above will make it much easier for Venezuelan aerial defense systems to target any US aircraft. But Trump has to act fast. This US Rep from Florida says she knows that Venezuela is sending uranium to Hamas. Oh, and they have about 1$ trillion worth of oil.
I believe that upon closer inspection, it turns out that the Executive Offices’ “delegated authority” over Parts South derives from the Monrovia Doctrine.
Be Ye of good cheer.
Zelensky declares renaming of Ukraine to Venezuela, in order to get the no-fly zone that he wanted so much. :)
::chortle::
Flight Radar 24 reveals Colombian planes are avoiding Venezuelan airspace (not sure if they always did – its a fairly minor re-route for them, but planes are still flying into and out of Caracas and other coastal cities. Its a handful, but then again, Venezuela is under heavy sanctions.
Just another tarbaby for Trump to tackle in his quest for the Nobel Piss Prize.
My guess is that the airspace ban is a blunt instrument to force Maduro to abdicate and seek asylum somewhere. UAE, or tbd?
I’m really starting to feel that this whole business is like a bad TV show that’s gone into syndication, and is endlessly repeating on late night TV:
Does Trump think George W. Bush lied about Iraq?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiw0ILaXJf0
I guess I’m the early bird today.
Concerning the BBC article on Card Fraud, I noticed this from the London small business owner who takes on the problem directly himself: “… the card machine providers and banks don’t seem to be doing anything.” There it is in black and white. These companies are glad to take the business fees from all concerned, but when it comes to a hard problem, dump the problem in the laps of the victims.
Secondly, I can see this phenomenon as an expression of my favourite Alchemist’s Creed: “As above, so below.” When an ‘ordinary’ person sees the high and mighty getting away with crime with impunity, the idea of emulating their “betters” seems only natural. Gresham’s Law at work in social and financial relations.
Again, stay safe. Those at the “top” are. We deserve no less.
I hate to think ill of my city, but I was reminded of what I consider to be a dark period here in NYC.
I realize that in many ways he is also a megalomaniac like Trump, but it is amazing to me how failed and illogical policies attributed to Giuliani have become the standard for so much of American life.
We have nationalized the “broken windows” prosecution strategy which really boiled down to heavy handed enforcement of “quality of life” crimes which were really about brutal beat downs and civil liberty of coping strategies of the have nots while ignoring or even encouraging financial criminality of the richest. It was a preview of life to come. It was the same with the Giuliani Doctrine where diplomacy was rejected for being the 800 lb gorilla in every room was really about keeping a small group of people wealthy and powerful without any recognition of common good. 
So many symptoms of this infection.
This isn’t at all a new phenomenon – it’s being going on for decades.  The cardholder calls in a chargeback and the credit card companies immediately yank the funds from the merchant and make them spend time contesting it if they want their money back.  My experience in contesting chargebacks has been that the card companies spend about 15 seconds reviewing the merchant’s argument and then rule in the cardholder’s favor.  American Express recently made it even harder to recover funds from these scams.  You can escalate things, talk to a rep, show them that you are a legit merchant doing business with AMEX for decades, show signed contracts and proof that a chargeback was fraudulent, but if you deviated from ever changing  AMEX approved procedures in your contestation, they will take the scammer’s word over yours every time.  And they make fees on both ends of the transaction to boot.
Quite the little racket they have going.  It’s beyond me why some enterprising lawyer hasn’t brought a class action lawsuit against these companies for knowingly profiting off fraudulent transactions.  Everything is a grift.
I heard an interview on I think JavaScript Jabber two or three years ago with a senior Stripe engineer, which provides a kind of API layer for processing credit cards, and he relayed that thieves would donate small amounts of money to charities with stolen cards to confirm that they work, and later the card holder charge backs would nuke charities and small businesses from orbit. Collateral damage, so to speak.
It would really upset me if the CC scammers changed their targets to the Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee for the test payments…
“Google trends for Washington DC and Tel Aviv expose another CIA/Mossad assassination”, this concerns the shooting of two National Guard members in DC. Apparently, online searches of the shooter’s name before the shooting took place. Hard not to conclude that the shooting had sponsors.
Then there is this:
“You might think this is just conspiracy theory nonsense and there is nothing to see here. Well, you are kind’a right because Google has erased most of the search data!”
So Google erased evidence of searches relative to the perpetrator peaking in the DC and Israel one day before the attack. 
Indeed. This is absolutely normal.
This reminds me that in the vast majority of attacks by Al Qaeda and ISIS since and including the 11th September 2001 (including in the USA, the UK, Belgium, France, Spain, Austria…), intelligence and security services in the USA, Europe, and elsewhere were perfectly aware that the perpetrators were dangerous terrorists, had placed them under surveillance, had compiled quite incriminating dossiers on them, had been explicitly warned by third parties (including other intelligence services and police) that those persons were planning attacks, knew that in some cases arrest warrants had been issued — and, oddly enough, did strictly nothing to prevent the tragedies.
Well, some people managed to get those stock shorting orders in to profit from the misery of the 9/11 victims, so not merely resting on their, uh, laurels. /:
Indeed.  And remember it was the Russians who warned about the Tsarnaev brothers responsible for the Boston Marathon bombings.
And remember all those “terrorist” attacks the FBI claimed to have thwarted under St. Robert Mueller’s leadership in the early 2000s, which turned out to be entrapment by the FBI.  They’d approach some unstable young men who had no intention of committing any crimes, and wind them up until they touched some weapon the FBI provided and then bust them.  I remember one such article from before the Boston Marathon bombing where the FBI tried to get someone to use a pressure cooker bomb in an attack, but their patsy wouldn’t go for it, preferring to use a flaming bag of poo on the doorstep as their weapon of choice.  Not long after, the Tsarnaevs did use a pressure cooker bomb in their attack.  What a coincidence!  And then after the attack,  a Tsarnaev associate died mysteriously at the hands of the FBI.
I apologize for the lack of a link regarding the flaming bag of poo story.  For some odd reason, I was never able to find the article again after the Boston Marathon attacks.  Imagine that.

This mirrors the reporting I read about Google trends before the Charlie Kirk shooting. Spikes in searches for the Losee Center, George Zinn, Timpanogos Regional Hospital, and Tyler Robinson, and more; emanating from D.C. as well as Israel…also scrubbed after the shooting.
But the US is the City on the Hill, the light of the world! Unpossible as Charlie Pierce puts it. Easy enough to call lines of bread crumbs coincidental and scoff at your childish conspiracy theory. Then there is hiding in plain sight and saying, “Who? Me?” … you have to be joking. I would never do a thing like that.”

“How Worried Should America Be About China’s Submarine Fleet?”
I liked the way that they end this article-
‘Combined, these new capabilities transform the PLAN’s submarine arm from a coastal force into a centerpiece of A2/AD strategy, complicating US operations in the region significantly.’
In this case, the ‘region’ that they are talking about is China’s coastline. The author is wondering how China got such a good force but it is not hard to work out. For decades now western countries have used China’s coastline as a naval parade ground so China decided to develop a force that would push them far away from there and out into the blue Pacific. Any country would have done the same and even Yemen has done this. At least this guy wasn’t shouting about a Submarine Gap.
US freedom of navigation operations (FONO) occur at the pleasure of the PLA Navy!  They probably look at the operations and gather data on emissions etc.
Integrating surface and submarine operations (including sophisticated undersea surveillance networks), supported by land based long range anti ship operations the PRC would establish a kill zone more than 1000 km from PRC coast.  That would include ocean space around Japan and Korea.
What kind and weight of operations could US execute to make it safe to operate outside PRC littorals?
Possible RAND’s pulled PRC paper was deficient in highlighting PRC capabilities.  Too beak for consumption in the pentagon?
Probably not so much the Pentagon but the Neocons like Lindsay Graham. They are always pushing against China, even after things blow up in their faces like with the refined rare earths fiasco. It’s like a ratchet which always goes one way and can never be wound back.
It blows up in “our faces, not “their faces”.
Getting “their faces” into the blast radius or their bodies into the ratchet is the whole trick now.
Until we sort that, well, this is what we get.
Worry about Chinese submarines? Why? I can do. nothing about them
Re. “How Worried Should America Be About China’s Submarine Fleet?,” the US has far more serious things to consider vis a vis China.
The FT has one of its ‘The Big Read’ pieces on —
Is China winning the innovation race?
Once the world’s factory, Beijing’s relentless focus on R&D means the country has become the world’s laboratory
https://www.ft.com/content/3eccd40e-5ec0-43e8-a521-3b87e29e323b
https://archive.ph/2hmfX
Short answer, from the FT, is yes. Setting aside its capitalist priors, it’s a decent factual piece of journalistic analysis such as you almost never get from the likes of the NYT, the Guardian, and all the other mainstream rags. And that’s because it’s written for people who actually need to know in order to form decisions. Which is confirmed by the 90 percent of commenters below the line who concur, and add information in some instances. I especially liked this comment —
‘Anyone, with functioning eyes and ears has concluded about 24 months ago that China is now the global technology and innovation superpower by wide margin. My own Overton Window firmly moved to this last December.
‘However propagandists at FT were talking about debt and real estate of China. Those are not untrue but not relevant anymore.
‘I pay my FT subscription only to understand what propaganda is MI6 driving. Otherwise from Mumbai it’s difficult to understand mind of MI6.
‘From this article, it’s clear now they have accepted superiority of China. Now the messaging for the crowd has began.’
In short, when the US has lost MI6 and the City….
My short, lazy read of history goes like this:
Empires, most empires anyway are built first on trade, then on a military to protect the trade routes and enforce trade rules.  The ancient Phoenicians, Egyptians, Greeks, Romans fit this pattern, I think.  The modern empires of UK and US, too.  (Yes, I’m leaving out colonialism here.)
So what did the West do to preserve its premier trading status?  Why, they sent their manufacturing capacity to other countries to save on labor costs and break unions.
Stock market soared.  The West sold the family silver and declared itself rich. Riiiight….. Bunch’a shortsighted idiots.
Now those other countries are making things to trade that the West used to make. And those other countries are increasing military capacity to protect their trade routes. When exactly did Western “leaders” stop reading history.  When did they assume that Francis Fukuyama’s 1992 book (coinciding with Clinton’s presidency) “The End of History and the Last Man Standing” was correct and the final word on the matter going forward?  Did they all assume “this time it will be different”?  Or that the future of the country didn’t matter because “I’ll be gone, you’ll be gone”, and we’ll get rich in the meantime?  Or were they simply clever and amoral?
/ end rant
Thanks for this comment.
The Phoenicians never had an empire.  You had city states that occasionally were very powerful economically.  They mostly competed with each other and had ever-changing alliances with true imperial powers outside their immediate geographical area.  Their military focus was predominantly defensive.
Carthage, originally founded by Tyrians, was another question.
Thanks.
I like your comment but a better analogy for the family silver would involve a golden goose. The West didn’t sell the golden goose. They gave it away.
Sorry to nitpick.
Adding to my above comment, this scene from the old move The Hunt for Red October comes to mind.  For those who haven’t seen the movie, it’s about a cat-and-mouse search for the enemy sub (US vs old Soviet) and the underwater dual that follows.  The Soviet sub captain locks torpedo target on the US sub and fires, thinking the shot is a sure kill of the US sub.  It’s not.
“You arrogant ass. You’ve killed us!”

“The week Europe realised it stands alone against Russian expansionism”
In which the Euronumpties turn themselves and the political economy of their nations into pretzels over “the Russian threat.”
Wait until their citizens discover that the whole thing is an empty charade. The Russians aren’t coming — there’s nothing in Europe that they either need nor want.
That article was quite the tour de force. Starting with the observations of famed historian Kaja Kallas, the author lays out the whole list of fear-mongering lies about the expansionist intentions of predator Putin, demonstrated by the entirety of Russian history, and the duplicity of the Trump administration that would sell-out the Civilized World to the Evil Rooskies. The author, Patrick Wintour (brother of Anna Wintour apparently), is the “Diplomatic editor” of the Guardian. He clearly knows his “diplomacy” when he sees it.
It is really hard to believe that this Oxford educated “journalist” from a distinguished family could actually believe the statements that are asserted in this piece of propaganda. But as I read this I kept thinking of that famous and oft-cited Chomsky statement to the BBC’s Andrew Marr when the latter denied he was “self-censoring” for propaganda purposes: “I’m sure you believe everything you’re saying. What I’m saying is that if you believed something different you wouldn’t be sitting where you are sitting.”
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2EPgix5_5w
I guess this is how you get to be Diplomatic Editor of the Guardian.
I only got two paragraphs into it, didn’t have the stomach then a friend showed up, but I was struck by how very close the headline and deck got to saying “The week Europe noticed that NATO is finished”.
Kaja Kallas claims RU/USSR has invaded 19 states on 33 occasions since 1900.  I have not seen her list, so here’s my suggestion (in alphabetical order):
Afghanistan, Austria, Bulgaria, China, Czechoslovakia, Estonia, Finland, Georgia, Germany, Hungary, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia
That’s 17, of which 13 were invaded during WW2 (and there’s quite a difference between rolling into eastern Poland in 1939 vs rolling into Berlin and Vienna in 1945, but I won’t quibble).  Leaving 4:
Afghanistan:  it was a hideously complicated situation back in 1979 and not just a simple invasion out of the blue, but I’ll give Kaja that one.
Georgia:  technically, the other guys shot first.  And the original deployment of RU peacekeepers there back in 1992 raised no hackles with the collective west.  I dunno.  
Moldova:  the inhabitants of Transnistria seem rather keen on being governed from Moscow, not that Kaja and the EU care about self-determination.  And that ‘invasion’ took place in 1991 when it was still part of the USSR, so technically it wasn’t an invasion.  I dunno.
Ukraine:  even messier than Afghanistan, but I’ll give Kaja that one too.
I cannot ID the other 2 countries Kaja has on her list.  Suggestions are welcome!
During WWII: 
Korea (to boot out the Japanese on the way to Japan);
Iran (joint invasion with Great Britain to ensure a path for the Land-Lease to the USSR).
Nice catch, missed those two!  I was thinking maybe Norway (the Red Army crossed over the border towards the end of WW2) or Mongolia (the border clashes with Japan in 1939), but both of those are really stretches (even by Kaja’s low standards).
How about a list for the US?
Post WW II occupation.  Soviet troops entered Korea from China after the Japanese surrender.  They supported Kim, ancestor of the current Kim now in Pyongyang.  The Soviets armed up the Koreans in their occupation zone.
A part of Kim’s new forces had fought the Japanese and Chiang’s Chinese in the north of China during WW II.
The zones were agreed with the US whose troops of US 8th Army occupied the area of the south where US install a Park who was educated and lived in USA while Korea was occupied by the Japanese.  US troops occupied Korea in June 1950, as opposed to very few Soviet troops in the north zone.
From Autumn, 1950, Mao supported Kim henceforth as much or more than Stalin.
That said Kajas’ simplistic list is propaganda.
Ottoman Empire in WWI.  Kars.
@Maxwell Johnston at 12:14 pm
Larry Johnson has a post on this. He lists countries invaded by Russia/Soviet Union and the reasons and then the times Russia/Soviet Union have been invaded.
Need I add that what Kaja Kallas says is nonsense.

“SpaceX’s Starship FL launch site will witness scenes once reserved for sci-fi films”
I wonder if they will build a backup pad or two in case something goes wrong like an explosion? In contrast. I was watching a video about Chinese Tekonauts the other day and something interesting came up. About two or three weeks ago a micrometeorite damaged the return vehicle attached to the Chinese space station. The video went into some length into how rapidly they adapted so that 16 days later they could send up another vehicle to the station, deliver the new crew and bring back those aboard. But what really made it possible was this. The Chinese will have a rocket ready to go on scheduled missions. But nearby they have a rocket ready to go as an emergency back up in a 5 or 16 day window. Logical and practical.
Meanwhile, remember those two Boeing astronauts stuck on the ISS for a coupla months when their delivery vehicle suffered multiple failures? Elon Musk was on Joe Rogan the other day and he said that the Biden admin decided to let those two astronauts stay stuck there until the elections were over. And I believe him.
You may have seen the story linked here that said the Russian launchpad for cargo ships to the ISS has been damaged and may be out of service for two years. Here’s a link on it
https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/11/russian-launch-pad-incident-raises-concerns-about-future-of-space-station/
Why loss of Russian participation matters
Not only does this cargo vehicle bring supplies to the Russian segment of the station, it is used as a primary means to reboost the space station’s altitude. It also services the Russian thruster attitude control system which works alongside the US control moment gyroscopes to maintain the station’s attitude and orientation. Notably, the Russian control system “desaturates” the US gyroscopes by removing their excess angular momentum.
Our public network has done several shows lately on the ISS. In one they discuss how loss of orientation could cause the whole thing to fail.

There is also that quote from The Great Gatsby-
‘They were careless people, Don and Melania – they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.’
Seems apt.
I have always considered that Tom and Daisy quote the “money line” from Gatsby. It applies to quite a gaggle her on Gatsby’s 100th anniversary.
Agree too on that Tom and Daisy quote being the “money line.” It’s the one part of that novel I remember the most.
re: “the energy emerging from this video is insane”
As is the very loud noise.  As a regular rider of the subway, I’d like to not have impromptu drum sessions on the platforms where I am stuck waiting for a train.  There used to be some nitwit who would play a trumpet in the subway car on the N/R line.   Like the drummers, he was not terribly talented, and my life was not changed for the better after hearing his ‘artistry’.  No wonder everybody uses Uber to get around town.
San Francisco had its own energetic street musicians around Union Square and elsewhere. They kindly lulled hotel guests to sleep and encouraged aerobic sidewalk maneuvers, even in the pre-poop map days. /s
As a former drummer, I do find people banging away in drum circles to be extremely annoying.  A favorite story from the Occupy protests – there were a few people who may not have been the most politically motivated who took advantage of the local encampment to have a temporary home.  There was one younger man who was a little rough around the edges and may have had a criminal record who was one of those who slept in the park.  He apparently did not like hippies with no talent as percussionists either.  When a group of them starting in at the crack of dawn before he was ready to wake up, he emerged from his tent, grabbed a hammer, and smashed it right though one of the drums.  Unfortunately, despite his righteous action, he was then arrested and removed from the encampment, but at least he was able to get that valuable message across first, and lighten the din.
That being said, that guy in the middle in the video is an extremely talented drummer.  I watched it twice.

Great New Republic takedown of our oh so corrupt president.
While lines began forming at food pantries around the country, Trump’s Great Gatsby party was a cavalcade of the mummified hangers-on of 2025, not the bright young things of 1925. The thrill of the hunt, with Epstein chasing a lineup of models, was replaced with the procession of the nouveau MAGA royalty kissing the king’s ring. Washington plastic surgeons, who have worked on Trump-orbit clients, have dubbed their look “that Mar-a-Lago face.” One D.C. doctor told Axios that constant Botox and cosmetic alterations create a syndrome of “filler blindness,” where in a world of similarly over-treated changelings, “you lose sight of anatomic normalcy.” 
At January’s Capitol Rotunda swearing in the background was a sea of Botox with Mrs. Vance seemingly the only normal person on hand. Gatsby of course was a work of fiction as were the Hunger Games films whose unsubtle satire of a ruling class out of control seems increasingly real. Those of us who once thought there might be some hope in Trump are feeling increasingly foolish. TDS folks may have hated him for all the wrong reasons but he seems determined to prove them right.

https://www.compactmag.com/article/the-great-feminization/
Is this the tripiest tripe that ever triped?  It’s circulating in parts of Reddit that should know better.  And is compactmag.com a stealth RWNJ outlet?  The Wikipedia article about it sounds sort of benign.  I’m clueless about this stuff.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_(American_magazine)
Tripe is delicious, if the cook knows what they’re doing.  Calling something tripe without at least hinting at what is objectionable is just an old guy yelling ‘get off my lawn’.  Can’t even tell if you’re objecting to – is the article too ‘woke’?  or not woke enough for your taste?   The article gives a fair amount of heft to both sides of the argument, in my reading.   My biggest complaint was that the author focused on L. Summers getting cancelled for bell curve musings instead of destroying the economy, which would have been more just.
You’re right about Summers destroying the economy being the real scandal. His resignation as Harvard President is often cited in accounts of the Epstein resignation, but the wrong reason is often adduced.
Almost all accounts of Summers’ resignation as Harvard President cite his comments about women in science, but it is worth remembering that the proximal cause of his resignation was the bitter attacks and questioning he got at a February 2006 meeting with faculty.  When Summers economist protege Andrei Shleifer lost a Federal False Claims Act suit against him, Summers protected Shleifer’s job at Harvard and cost Harvard $28 million in damages and penalties  as a result of Shelifer and his wife’s peculations during their time setting up Russian securities markets under a Federal contract with Harvard. Summers told the faculty meeting he didn’t know nuthin. The article that touched off the questioning is here.
Summers has big prestige as an economist, and  — obviously — as an academic patron, but his mismanagement of the Harvard endowment, and his role advocating the most disastrous policy failures of the last thirty years suggests you don’t want him handling your money.
I enjoyed the Compact ‘Great Feminization’ article quite a bit- and think its
author made a pretty good case.
I found it interesting that all these feminized fields, they’re all the arena of the PMC. Is the issue with feminization or just a peculiar strain most particular to PMC class women?
I have no idea, but all the areas and fields mentioned, from HR, to colleges, to law, are all professionalized, credentialed fields.
Or maybe women are all the same in large groups, credentialed or not, irrespective of class affinity?
I thought it was an interesting argument to equate a biracial person not wanting to meet up with someone known to be a bigot as some sort of toxic feminization making its way into the industry of journalism. The article was basically an essay on why men act rational and women act irrational. A lot of these arguments scream hysteria to me, but maybe that’s just me being feminized and based on vibes instead of rationality.
Was it? The point was made about intra-group conflict versus inter-group conflict. I didn’t get the sense that the behavior was irrational within context.
A serious problem is that I do not see the author providing any evidence to back up their statements. Looks like a rant to me.
Be careful of the people that come along with their own twist on the subject and say “Nothing a good war wouldn’t solve.”

As is typical, misses the fact that if you’re on the apps, and you’re not a top 10% guy, you aren’t really getting any matches. So the outcome is not really a surprise here
A survey conducted by the Kinsey Institute in partnership with the sexual wellness brand Lovehoney found that one in four gen Z adults aged 18 to 24 have not had partnered sex yet. Break that down by gender, and you will find that one in three gen Z men reported never having partnered sex, compared with only one in five gen Z women. (Kinsey Institute + Lovehoney, 2022)
You could say that gen Z men are grappling with a great “relationship recession” too, based on their likelihood of being single. (Pew Research Center, 2023)

b.  to provide a bargaining chip in negotiations w RU; i.e., if you don’t soften your terms, we can shut down your oil shipments via the Black Sea
c.  to demonstrate UKR’s potential usefulness as an anti-RU bulwark going forward, especially if it retains a Black Sea coastline
To which I would add a fourth (and perhaps the most likely):  just for the sheer nihilistic fun of it (especially while Zelensky and Yermak are out of town, leaving the too-clever-by-half Budanov unsupervised).  As we approach the end game in this conflict, we can expect more such wild attempts at escalation.
A likely result of these attacks (aside from whacking a vessel or two in transit to Odessa) will be to convince the Kremlin that post-war rump UKR must be landlocked (with Odessa and Nikolaev becoming RU-controlled ports). 
Upon hearing about this stunt, my first reaction was that it might be an unfortunate accident (stray mines).  I could not believe that UKR would do something so stupid and self-defeating, but once again I was wrong.
Like you said, the Ukraine keeps on giving Russia reasons to take the Russian city of Odessa and leave the Ukraine a land-locked country. Those attacks have also caused this-
‘A major crude hub on Russia’s Black Sea coast that handles around 80% of Kazakhstan’s oil exports has suspended operations after a mooring at its terminal near Novorossiysk was heavily damaged in an attack, its operator, the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), said on Saturday.
The consortium, whose shareholders include major energy companies from Russia, the United States, Kazakhstan and several Western European countries, described the incident as an attack on infrastructure serving the interests of multiple states. “No sanctions or restrictions have ever been imposed on the CPC, reflecting the company’s recognized role in safeguarding the interests of its Western shareholders,” the statement said.’
https://www.rt.com/news/628675-drone-strike-halt-black-sea-oil-terminal-operations/
The Ukrainians are going off the reservation then. That or they are following orders.
Trump: Anything Signed by Biden’s Autopen Is Revoked – Townhall
“With Biden, he goes a step further—was the man even cogent enough to know what was being discussed for signature?”
“Joe Biden was not involved in the Autopen process and, if he says he was, he will be brought up on charges of perjury.”
Since this story has been presented again, I guess a lawyer can fill in the blanks…
Would Biden be considered cogent enough to be brought up perjury charges because he could say he was involved?
If that happened, would the administration have to prove he’s cogent enough for perjury charges in the present, but not cogent in the past?
I think Trump should be encouraged to wear his crown at ceremonial occasions, such as SOTU to emphasize that his authority comes from Gawd and not the consent of the Governed.
Divine Providence…
He should wear it upside down.
That would make it a Crown of Thorns and encourage, shall we say, inappropriate self-images in the continually declining mind of our Divine Fearless Leader.
I was thinking more of a dunce cap, but maybe you have a point.

India Is a Rising Power, but Its Capital Is a Lethal Gas Chamber (NY Times via archive.ph)
New Delhi wakes up to toxic smog and goes to sleep in the same harmful conditions.
In the hours between, the 30 million residents of India’s capital region trudge along with chronic headaches and itchy eyes, symptoms of this rising superpower’s failure to provide its people with a most basic need: breathable air.
Experts at the nation’s top research hospital call the air “severe and life-threatening.” The level of toxic pollutants — from cars, factories and crop-waste burning by farmers — has been as many as 20 times above recommended levels for safe breathing.
Gotta be bad combined with Climate and an ongoing Pandemic.

80,2025-11-30,"In case you missed it, Microsoft caused some outcry a little while ago after it announced that it would     increase the cost of the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription plan by 50%. People quickly learned that if you didn't purchase your Xbox Game Pass Ultimate through Microsoft and instead purchased gift cards at stores, you could still pick them up at the old price, something that     GameStop even advertised it would do.    
Well, now that the Cyber Monday deals are here, you can save even more money by purchasing the gift cards at the old price and at a discount. And if that sounds good to you, you'll be pleased to know that you can snag six months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for a cool $95.
Over on Newegg, the store is selling two 3-month Xbox Game Pass Ultimate codes for $95. The ""usual"" price for these is $120, but comparing it to that doesn't quite get across the main reason why this deal is so good.
The price Newegg lists on its page is the old price for six months of subscription. If you were to sub for six months via Microsoft's methods, you'll get the new, increased price of $180. So, while this deal is technically $25 off, it's more like $85 off if you use what it should cost.
The store has a purchase limit of 20, so if you want, you can stock up on 10 years' worth of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate codes. However, it's probably a better idea to grab a year or two if you see yourself using the service for a while. However, do note that the codes are emailed to you, and they'll only work on US accounts.
Xbox Game Pass Ultimate gives you access to over 100 games on Xbox and PC, including access to cloud gaming so you can play on the Surface Pro 9.
Other than the fact that you're buying the codes for far less than what they should be, the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is kind of like the Netflix of the gaming world. It lets you play a catalog of games at no extra cost, with new titles getting added all the time. It also unlocks Xbox Cloud Gaming, which lets you stream games on the cloud; perfect for playing modern-day games on your phone, for instance."
81,2025-11-30,"We've all heard the saying, ""It's better to drive a slow car fast than a fast car slow."" This highly modified Fiat 126 is the ultimate evolution of that philosophy. While its extensive upgrades do improve performance and make you feel like you're driving a rally car, it's still dog slow. That means you can get all the sensations and thrills of driving fast on public roads at something resembling the speed limit.
As Tom Woodward tells Twin Engine Corsa, he was looking for a Mazda Miata, which is always the answer and one of the ultimate slow cars to drive fast. Instead, he found a ""baby sick yellow"" Fiat 126 with pink wheels for sale. He recognized it from a local pub parking lot, where it had been sitting for years. Woodward ""made him an offer I didn't really want to pay,"" which the owner accepted, so now it was his.
Woodward's Instagram account for the project shows much of the story. In addition to the usual rust repair, he tackled many of the standard tasks associated with restoring an old car, such as fabricating massive aluminum fender flares and having a full roll cage installed by a friend who worked for a little company called Prodrive. You might have heard of them. The interior also gained a custom aluminum dashboard, transmission tunnel, and even door cards that look amazing. Woodward runs a little shop called Woodward Motors Fabrication Co. Its Facebook page has more pictures of Porsches than Fiats, which says something about the quality of his work.
At the heart of this build is this 740 cc inline-3 engine from a BMW K75 motorcycle, replacing the stock Fiat two-cylinder. An inline-4 wouldn't fit in the tiny engine bay, but the K75 engine is basically a K100 with one cylinder chopped off, making it a perfect fit. Its 75 horsepower didn't hurt, either, more than twice as much as the original Fiat unit, which certainly didn't rev to 10,000 RPM, either. Woodward still wants a little bit more power and has already acquired a tiny Garrett turbo to add to the mix. A little bit goes a long way in a car that weighs only about 1,100 pounds.
One of the advantages of a motorcycle engine swap is that it's an easy way to get a sequential transmission. Woodward completely ignored this, opting instead for a six-speed sequential transmission used for Fiat 126 and 500 race cars. He fabricated an adapter plate to put the two pieces together. Another friend completely rewired the car, using an ECU Masters computer to run the engine and add a digital dashboard. Tiny 13-inch Superlite wheels are a big upgrade from the original 10-inch units, making room for tiny four-piston brake calipers in the front and two-piston calipers in the rear.
This is all fun to talk about from an engineering perspective, but how the car drives down the road is what matters most. The video is well worth watching, mainly because at least half of it is pure engine sounds from that BMW triple. It looks, sounds, and drives like a race car, but it feels like you're going 100 mph when you're only going 40. Woodward hasn't taken the Fiat to a track day because he knows he'd be a rolling roadblock for other traffic, but his Instagram shows he has taken it drag racing at least once. I imagine it feels like a scene from ""The Fast and the Furious,"" where it takes three minutes of movie time to complete a ""ten-second"" quarter mile. Driving slow can be fun in itself, especially in a car that still feels fast."

I read Ann Rand’s novel, the Fountain Head, in High School and loved it.  I had intended to go on and read the book she wrote after that, Atlas Shrugged, but just never got around to it.  However, I never stopped thinking that the title was just so perfect.  It’s so evocative. Two words that encapsulated so much and presented such a clear image in the mind’s eye. 
A giant colossus stands with the world held steady on his tremendous shoulders.  Beads of sweat on his face.  The strain in his body palpable.  Then, without warning, the strain becomes too much.  He shrugs, and the stability of the world he balanced on his shoulders is forever shattered.
The Start of Our Tale
In 1993 I joined Hewlett-Packard as a financial analyst working for Corporate Financial Reporting.  Four years later I was on my 3rd role at HP working for HP’s General Counsel (Chief Lawyer) in the capacity of Senior Director responsible for IT and Finance Operations of HP’s Legal Department.  At that time HP’s Legal Department included some 300 individuals and spent about $50M in outside counsel fees.  It was essentially a mid-sized law firm inside a large company.
The event in this story, I believe represents the start of the HP’s slide from greatness.  A fall that resulted in multiple spinouts and splits over the course of a decade and a half.  I further believe that this decline was not inevitable and first and foremost stems from what can only be termed a crisis of confidence. 
HP as Colossus
When I joined HP there were three major business groups.  The Test and Measurement business was the oldest part of HP. It went back to the founding of the company in the 1930’s.  HP’s first product was an audio oscillator and one of their first customers was Walt Disney. Disney would go on to use these oscillators to test audio equipment in the 12 specially equipped theaters that were to show Fantasia in 1940.
In 1966 HP entered the computer segment and this became the 2nd major business line that made up the company.  The last major business that made up HP was printing and imaging.  They produced both laser and ink jet printers.  Most people at the time knew of HP because of their calculators, computers or their printers.  Few knew it anymore as a leading test and measurement company though it still was.
In the early 90’s, HP was a Fortune 25 company.  It had been around for nearly three quarters of a century and it had been able to adapt and thrive despite continuous technological change.  Though not equal, revenues were nicely distributed across the three major business segments, and all were solid, growing businesses. 
HP’s revenues had been growing in double digits for several years before I joined and would continue to do so for several years after I joined.  For a Fortune 25 company, this kind of multi-year double digit growth in revenue and earnings was not a common occurrence. 
The company was thought of as one of the best run companies in America.  There had even developed a bit of mythology over its management practices.  Dubbed the “HP Way”, HP’s management practices were held out by the business community as an exemplar of what a great company culture should look like. 
For my part, on balance, I thought it lived it up to its reputation in those days of being an extremely progressive company.  It was ahead of the most other companies in both how it managed its people and how it executed business operations.
Creeping Doubts
Around 1997, when I was working for the General Counsel, HP engaged a major global consulting firm in a multi-year project to help them think about the question: “What happens to very large companies that have experienced significant growth for multiple successive years?”  This is an oversimplification of the scope of the engagement, but I believe that it was the fundamental question that weighed heavily on the minds of senior executives of the company at that time.
Among many findings and recommendations, at the highest level, was an assessment that the decade long trend of double-digit growth was unlikely to continue.  The consulting firm recommended that the company begin to plan for much slower growth in the future. 
At one level this finding wasn’t surprising.  Looking back over history it made sense that most companies which had experienced a similar situation, were unable to sustain extraordinary levels of growth.   However, I believe the way that HP’s senior executives internalized these findings sowed the seeds for a two-decade long slide. 
Changing Behavior / Changing Culture
When I first joined HP in the early 90’s as part of Corporate Financial Reporting, I got to see up close how aggressively HP’s business leaders pushed back against expense and investment guidance’s issued by the companies CFO.  Especially when they believed that following that guidance would undercut their ability to achieve their business objectives.
It was clear to me that these business unit leaders felt strongly that they had net positive investment opportunities in front of them, so they were willing to fight hard to ensure that they had the resources to pursue those opportunities.  There was an extremely healthy back and forth between HP’s business General Managers and HP’s CFO. 
After the report was issued, it felt to me like HP’s business leaders had lost their will to fight.  They appeared to have fully embraced the idea that the future held slower growth.  That shift in thinking had deep and profound effects on how the company operated.  Rather than continuing to be obsessed with how to win in the market, increasingly the focus became how not to lose. 
The behavior I saw is similar to what you sometimes see in sporting events.  A team has a comfortable lead and then rather than continuing to play the way that got them that lead they start to play not lose.  You often see the team that was behind roar back, taking advantage of their opponent’s newfound caution.
A Very Different HP
HP finished the 90’s with big and momentous changes.  Changes that I believe have their roots in a change from “let’s win” thinking to “let’s not lose” thinking.  HP spun out Test and Measurement as Agilent Technologies in 1999.  In the early 2000’s Agilent was rocked by layoffs as it faced a significant downturn in the Telecom marketplace.  Perhaps it would have fared better had it been part of a larger organization, more able to weather the storm.
Lew Platt retired from HP right after the Agilent spinout and was succeeded by Carly Fiorina as CEO.  While Platt “retired’ from HP he didn’t retire from being a CEO.  He went on to run Kendal Jackson winery for a year and then Boeing several years later.  Perhaps after spinning out Test and Measurement, the part of the company where Platt had spent so much of his career, HP no longer felt like home.
Carly Fiorina succeeded Lew as HP’s CEO.  Fiorina, a veteran of Bell Labs and Lucent, didn’t gel well with the more laid-back HP culture.  The HP / Compaq merger, a combination that Carly fiercely championed, was like bringing together oil and water. At best, the Compaq merger could be characterized as an unnecessary distraction.  At worst it generated tens of thousands of layoffs and severely damaged trust between the rank and file and HP’s leadership.
Carly was in turn succeeded by Mark Hurd.  Hurd severely cut back investment on R&D, a trend that had started while Carly was CEO.   After Mark was unceremoniously fired for misconduct, the debacle of Autonomy under CEO Leo Apotheker rocked HP.  Finally, in 2015, PC and printer business units separated from the server and enterprise services business units to form HP and HPE respectively.
One Key Takeaway
There is no way to tell whether HP would have been better off or worse of had executives continued to have a more positive business outlook in the late 90’s.  The end of the 90’s and the early 2000s were incredibly chaotic as the dotcom bubble expanded rapidly and then just as rapidly deflated.  At the turn of the century, the pace of change took a dramatic upturn, and it has done nothing but continue to accelerate since then.
In thinking about those times and how HP fared it’s important to keep in mind that “HP shrugged” its shoulders, not because it was hit by external market forces but because it had let self-doubt enter into its psyche.  It may have gone on to stumble in the future irrespective of what it believed or didn’t believe but that’s not what happened.  HP initiated the stumble by doubting its ability to continue to be as successful as it had been during the past decade long period.
Looking back on this time, I feel that there is at least one key takeaway irrespective of what happened to the business.  That takeaway is simply this:  if you think you will not succeed then you pretty much guarantee that you won’t.  If you think that you will succeed, the odds may still be against you, but at least you have a chance. 
Playing to win versus playing not to lose will also have a positive effect on the employee morale of those that have to deliver on the mission of the organization.  That better morale will almost certainly translate into a more motivated work force – which in turn should further increase your chances of success.
 David – thanks for sharing this. It was a great walk down memory lane, and your observations definitely resonate with my own experiences at HP.

PagerDuty just reported earnings, and the numbers tell a sobering story.  The Captain Obvious lesson and reminder: Growth Remains King.  Even if you are profitable.
You just have to grow.  And for now at least — PagerDuty just isn’t growing anymore.
Here’s where they are today:
And yet the stock is down 75%+ from its 2021 highs. Down nearly 50% from its IPO price of $38.25 back in 2019.

Profitable isn’t enough. You have to grow.
PagerDuty has built something real. Almost $500M in ARR. Over 15,000 paying customers. One-third of the Fortune 500. Customers like Cisco, Zoom, Fox, Shopify, and the NYSE. A 28.5% non-GAAP operating margin. Nearly $550M in cash on the balance sheet. 83%+ gross margins.
This is a real business. A profitable business. A business that serves mission-critical use cases — when systems go down at 2am, PagerDuty is the one waking up the right engineer.
And the market values it at 2x ARR.
Meanwhile, companies still growing 30%+ trade at 10-15x ARR or more or higher.  That’s a 5-7x difference in multiple.
The lesson: A dollar of ARR growing 30%+ is worth 5-7x more than a dollar of ARR growing 4%.

PagerDuty was once a rocketship. At IPO in 2019, they had 139% NRR — truly elite expansion. In 2022, it was still 124-126%. Customers were landing and expanding aggressively.
Today? 100% NRR.
That single metric tells the whole story. At 100% NRR:
Here’s what the metrics trajectory looks like:

When your NRR drops from 130%+ to 100%, your growth engine fundamentally breaks. You go from a flywheel to a treadmill.
PagerDuty has had roughly 15,000-16,000 paid customers for three years. Essentially flat.
Yes, they’ve grown the number of $100K+ customers from 825 to 867. That’s good! But it’s only 5% growth. And the overall customer base isn’t expanding.
When your customer count goes flat, it means one of two things:
Either way, it signals that finding new customers has gotten very, very hard.

Here’s what founders sometimes miss: Profitability is necessary but not sufficient.
PagerDuty made all the “right” moves for the 2022-2024 efficiency era:
The market shrugged.
Why? Because investors aren’t just buying today’s profits — they’re buying future cash flows. And if your ARR is only growing 4%, your future cash flows are capped.
The valuation math:
The premium multiples go to companies that can compound. 20%+ growth with strong unit economics gets 8-12x ARR. 30%+ gets you 12-18x. 40%+ and you’re looking at 20x+.
PagerDuty’s 4% growth puts them in a different category entirely.

In July 2025, Reuters reported that PagerDuty is exploring a sale with Qatalyst Partners. This is actually the second time they’ve explored selling — a similar effort in late 2023 didn’t produce an acceptable offer.
This tells you everything about where the board’s head is at:
The good news? At 2-3x ARR, PagerDuty is actually cheap for what it is. A strategic buyer who could cut costs further, or bundle it with other products, might pay 3-4x+ ARR. That’s a 30-50% premium from here.
But for a company that once traded at 15-20x ARR? That’s a painful outcome for long-term shareholders.
Here’s what makes PagerDuty’s situation even harder: the competitive landscape has fundamentally shifted against them.
Attack from Above: The Platform Giants Are Bundling
The biggest threat isn’t another startup — it’s the observability platforms bundling incident management into their offerings.
In June 2024, Datadog launched Datadog On-Call, bringing paging and incident management directly into their observability platform. Their pitch is devastating for PagerDuty: why switch between tools when you can have monitoring AND on-call in one platform with shared context?
As one analyst noted, Datadog’s On-Call “could directly challenge PagerDuty and Atlassian Opsgenie” by reducing context switching for IT ops teams.
ServiceNow is another threat — they generate more than 20x PagerDuty’s revenue and are expected to grow at 21% CAGR. For large enterprises already in the ServiceNow ecosystem for ITSM, adding incident management is a checkbox, not a new vendor decision.
Cisco acquired Splunk. Atlassian has OpsGenie. The platform consolidation trend is real, and standalone point solutions like PagerDuty are caught in the squeeze.
Attack from Below: Hungry Startups Eating Their Lunch
Meanwhile, a new wave of Slack-native incident management startups has emerged:
These startups are purpose-built for modern engineering teams. They’re Slack-native (where engineers actually live), more affordable, and laser-focused on the incident response workflow. As one industry survey noted, “PagerDuty and OpsGenie remain the most-used solutions, but young startups like incident.io, Rootly, and FireHydrant are challenging them.”
The startups explicitly position against PagerDuty’s complexity and cost. Rootly’s marketing literally says “Migrate from PagerDuty faster than you can write fair pricing.”
The Market Has Changed
When PagerDuty went public in 2019, they were the clear category leader with 139% NRR. The “incident management” category was theirs.
But the market fragmented:
PagerDuty tried to expand into AIOps, automation, and business operations to grow the TAM. But as one analyst observed, they “operate in a crowded market filled with bigger competitors like Cisco’s Splunk and ServiceNow.”
The result? A category leader that’s being squeezed from above by bundlers and from below by insurgents — while the core market matures.
PagerDuty pioneered on-call incident management. They defined the category. And they won it.
But here’s the problem: Categories have natural sizes.
The “core” incident management market isn’t infinite. Most companies that need sophisticated on-call rotation and alerting already have a solution. PagerDuty got most of the big ones.
They tried to expand the TAM with:
But these adjacencies haven’t moved the needle enough. The $36B TAM they cite in investor decks isn’t converting to $36B of real demand for PagerDuty specifically.
When you dominate a category but the category stops growing, you have three options:
1. NRR is destiny. When NRR drops below 110%, alarm bells should go off. Below 100%, you’re in serious trouble. Monitor this metric religiously.
2. Customer count growth matters. Flat customer counts for 3 years isn’t a plateau — it’s a warning sign that your market may be saturated or your GTM motion is broken.
3. Profitability buys you time, not valuation. Getting to profitability is essential for survival. But don’t expect the market to reward efficiency alone. You still need growth.
4. Category size is a ceiling. If you’re dominating a $500M category, you’re going to be a ~$500M ARR company. Expanding the category is possible but brutally hard.
5. The “rule of 40” isn’t a multiple accelerator at low growth. 4% growth + 28% margins = 32, which is below 40. But even if it were above 40, a 4% grower trades very differently than a 30% grower with similar efficiency.
PagerDuty built a great product. They serve real customers with real pain. They’re profitable and have a fortress balance sheet.
And the market values them at 2-3x ARR because growth has stalled.
This is the new reality of B2B and SaaS. Profitability is table stakes now. Efficiency is expected. What commands premium multiples is durable growth.
If you can’t grow, you can still build a great business. But you won’t build a great stock. And you may end up selling for far less than you once dreamed.
Profitable is not enough. You have to grow.
Digging into PagerDuty’s Q3 FY26 investor presentation reveals a few more fascinating data points:
1. The Quarter-by-Quarter NRR Collapse is Stark
The presentation shows the sequential decline in painful detail:
Five straight quarters of decline. That’s not noise — that’s a trend. And it’s not bottoming out; it’s hitting the floor.
2. They Slashed Sales & Marketing from 53% to 30% of Revenue
This is the real story behind the margin expansion. In FY20, PagerDuty spent 53% of revenue on sales and marketing. Today? Just 30%.
That’s 23 percentage points cut from GTM investment. Yes, it helped margins. But it also helps explain why growth collapsed. You can’t cut your way to growth.
3. R&D Spend Dropped from 26% to 16%
Similarly, R&D went from 26% of revenue in FY20 to just 16% today. When you’re being attacked by nimble startups and platform giants, cutting R&D by 10 points feels dangerous.
PagerDuty is leaner, but is it still innovating fast enough?
4. They Claim a $50B TAM with Only ~1% Penetration
The investor deck cites 87 million potential users across developers (30M), infrastructure ops (23M), customer service (28M), and SecOps (6M) — and claims only ~1% penetration.
If true, that’s massive upside. But if you’re only penetrating 1% of a $50B market after 15 years and you’re growing 5%… something doesn’t add up. Either the TAM is overstated or the go-to-market isn’t working.
5. They’ve Tried to Buy Growth — Rundeck (2020), Catalytic (2022), Jeli (2023)
The innovation timeline reveals a string of acquisitions: Rundeck for automation in 2020, Catalytic for no-code workflows in 2022, and Jeli for post-incident learning in 2023.
These were bets on expanding beyond core incident management. But three years later, growth is still stalling. Acquisitions alone can’t fix a slowing core business — they have to be integrated and monetized. The jury is still out.

85,2025-11-30,"ByHannah Abraham,
Contributor.
For years the Japanese domestic film market has been dominated by anime movies, and for good reason. However, a new contender has recently emerged from the unlikeliest of backgrounds; Kokuho — not a thrilling spy caper or a fluffy romance as one would expect, but a three-hour period drama about classical theater form kabuki.
Kokuho, directed by Lee Sang-il and distributed by Toho, earned 17.37 billion yen ($111 million) as of November 25, according to the distributor. This surpasses the 17.35 billion yen record held by Bayside Shakedown 2 since 2003. The film drew 12.31 million admissions after 172 days in theaters following its June 6 release.
Based on Shuichi Yoshida’s novel of the same name, the film runs two hours and 55 minutes and follows the rivalry between two kabuki actors over five decades. Ryo Yoshizawa and Ryusei Yokohama star as onnagata performers (male actors specializing in female roles) with Ken Watanabe in a supporting role.
The record applies specifically to domestic Japanese live-action films. Kokuho ranks 11th overall in Japan's box office history across all categories. Demon Slayer: Mugen Train holds the overall domestic record at 40.75 billion yen, more than double Kokuho's gross. Foreign live-action films including Titanic and Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone also exceed its earnings.
The 22-year gap since the previous live-action record reflects Japan's animated film dominance. Of the country's top ten highest-grossing films domestically, seven are animated. Japan's film market ranks third globally, but live-action Japanese productions rarely approach the figures that anime features routinely achieve.
Japan selected Kokuho as its official submission for Best International Feature at the 98th Academy Awards. The film premiered in the Directors' Fortnight section at Cannes Film Festival in May before its domestic release, giving it the festival pedigree that often supports Oscar campaigns.
However, the international feature category is competitive. This year's contenders include Cannes Palme d'Or winner It Was Just an Accident and Grand Prix winner Sentimental Value, among others. GKIDS acquired North American distribution rights and held qualifying runs in Los Angeles and New York in November, with a planned wider theatrical release in early 2026.
Japan has seen recent Oscar success: Godzilla Minus One won Best Visual Effects in 2024, and Hayao Miyazaki's The Boy and the Heron won Best Animated Feature the same year. Whether Kokuho can secure a nomination remains uncertain, though its domestic performance and Cannes screening provide visibility.
The film's success has had measurable effects on kabuki theater attendance. Kabukiza Theatre in Tokyo reported approximately 10,000 first-time visitors between July and October, representing a nearly 30 percent increase in new audiences compared to the previous year, according to venue organizers. Yoshida's source novel has sold 2 million copies, according to the publisher.
The production required extensive preparation, with lead actor training in kabuki performance taking approximately 18 months. The film depicts both backstage preparation and onstage performance, requiring authenticity in movement, voice, and traditional theater protocols.
The film's commercial trajectory differs from typical blockbuster patterns. Rather than front-loaded opening weekend earnings, Kokuho accumulated revenue over nearly six months, suggesting sustained audience interest. This pattern aligns with prestige films that build momentum through critical reception rather than marketing saturation.
The film’s subject matter—kabuki theater with its centuries-old traditions—and its runtime exceeding typical commercial length typically limit box office potential. That it found an audience of over 12 million admissions (per the Hollywood Reporter) indicates appetite for culturally specific storytelling, even if it doesn't challenge anime's market dominance.
Director Lee Sang-il previously directed Hula Girls (2006) and Villain (2010), the latter also based on a Yoshida novel. Aniplex, which is backed by Sony, and Myriagon Studio produced Kokuho. The film screened at the Toronto International Film Festival in September alongside its Cannes premiere."

The maelstrom that is Cyber Monday is upon us. The biggest sales event of the year lasts almost a whole month these days, and is one of the best times to snag a deal or five. One of the most popular items on shoppers' lists if you're a Nintendo Switch 2 owner is a new microSD Express card.
This 512GB SanDisk microSD Express card is only $89.24 at Amazon, a 15% price cut from its $104.99 list price and a new low on Amazon.
You can also pick up the slightly cheaper Samsung P9 512GB microSD Express for just $74.99, a 25% reduction from its $99.99 price.
Finally, we also have a wonderful deal on a 256 GB Samsung card for only $39.
In comparison to the Nintendo Switch 2's launch, there is now plenty of stock of these microSD cards, with Samsung's P9 Express only releasing onto the market fairly recently. With these sales and the festive holidays on the near horizon, this is a great opportunity to snap one of these cards up early as a stocking filler.
SanDisk's microSD card can deliver impressive read speeds of up to 880MB/s and write speeds of up to 650MB/s, with a sustained write speed of 220MB/s. The new microSD Express cards are required for the Nintendo Switch 2 console, due to the much faster transfer speeds over standard microSDXC cards. This allows games to install, load, and stream data much faster, for a better gameplay and user experience.
With double the internal storage capacity of the Nintendo Switch 2 games console, this microSD Express card from SanDisk can add 512GB of extra storage for installing your game library.  This microSD card can deliver read speeds of up to 880MB/s and write speeds of up to 650MB/s, with a sustained write speed of 220MB/s.
Although these tiny SD cards pale in size to an M.2 SSD (2280), the P9 Express and SanDisk cards leverage the NVMe protocol using a PCIe 3.0 x1 interface. That enables maximum sequential read speeds of up to 880 MB/s, with random read/write endurance rated at 65,000 IOPS and 52,000 IOPS, respectively, to contend with the best microSD Express cards.
Give your Switch 2 the storage boost it needs. With fast speeds and respectable endurance, the P9 Express from Samsung is one of the best microSD Express cards you can get.
This may be a smaller card at 256GB, but it's a steal at a mere $39. Grab it fast before it's gone!
MicroSD Express cards have roughly 4x the performance of a standard UHS-I card, an essential requirement for use in Nintendo's latest console. Speed is king when loading large textures and other assets. This fast, SSD-like storage is perfect for the Switch 2, but would not be as useful for the likes of the Steam Deck, where the card would only operate at standard microSD speeds.

88,2025-11-30,"Richard Simmons' estate is looking to make a deal because the late fitness icon's longtime Hollywood Hills home just got a major price cut ... TMZ has learned.
According to property records obtained by TMZ, Simmons' estate knocked a hefty $410k off the original asking price on Saturday. The house first hit the market in June for $7 million, but now the property can be yours for a slightly more reasonable $5,889,999.
And there's plenty of real estate to justify the nearly $6 million price tag. As we previously reported ... the 4-bedroom, 5-bathroom stunner features just over 4,000 square feet of living space on a half-acre lot. The pad includes a rare circular swimming pool and a dedicated pool house.
The home boasts a 4-room, 2-level primary suite complete with a dressing room, oversized bath, and an upper-level equipped gym. There's also a secondary guest suite and a separate upstairs den.
Simmons lived on the property for decades before his sudden death last July. We broke the news ... the beloved fitness star was found unresponsive in the home by his longtime housekeeper, Teresa Reveles.

Technology in automobiles has dramatically improved over the last decade or so. You have the ability to be treated with a whole host of convenience features that make the driving experience far more comfortable and fun, rather than just being tethered to terrestrial radio. The driving experience can be personalized to your preferences. These technology improvements have also resulted in improved safety features and better efficiency as well. All that being said, sometimes the most appealing feature you can find in a vehicle is the ability to just plug in something to your car, using it as a power source.
People have been able to do this for a long time with the plug for the cigarette lighter, but lately, we have seen a massive rise in the number of USB plugs in vehicles, with the most recent of them being USB-C plugs. It's a real treat to see one USB-C plug in your center console, but things get even better when there are multiple around the vehicle, including being accessible by the rear seats. There are a surprising number of different devices that you can plug into these USB-C ports. 
While some of them are incredibly obvious to most people, there are a number of surprising ways these ports can be utilized as well. Here, we are going to look at five different ways you can use your car's USB-C ports. These are going to be categories and not specific products, as a list of USB-C products for cars would be unwieldy and far too long. The products that could be mentioned will most likely fall into one of the five categories.
We begin with what is probably the most obvious use for a car's USB-C ports, and that is for charging a variety of electronic devices. USB-C products have been in production for about a decade at the time of writing this, but it is really in the last few years when that USB format really took over from the USB-A style that preceded it. You will typically find USB-C connections for most smartphones, whether they be iPhones, Androids, or something else, and being able to plug your smartphone into your car is a major benefit. Gone are the days of worrying that your smartphone's battery is going to die while you are out and about. Of course, you can plug in more than just smartphones for charging, too. You may have a tablet that needs charging.
This is where having USB-C ports all around the car be a massive help. That way, you and your friends or family can charge all of their devices simultaneously, and considering every person's dependency on these kinds of devices nowadays, everyone is keeping a close eye on their device's battery. Some vehicles are going to be able to charge your devices faster than others, but getting any kind of charge for them on your commute is better than not getting any at all. There are certain items you should avoid plugging into your car's USB-C port, such as laptops, as they simply require too much power, but if the device you need charged is rather small, you should be in good shape.
Apple CarPlay and Android Auto have been enormously helpful in improving the driving experience. You can easily play your music, play podcasts, make phone calls, use a navigation app, send text messages, and more without ever having to look down at your smartphone. Not only is it easy to use, but it improves how safe you are when driving, as you aren't constantly looking down at your phone and taking your eyes off of the road. While a lot of vehicles have connectivity through Wi-Fi for you to set up Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, that isn't the case with every car.
Some vehicles require you to hardwire your smartphone into your car for it to work. It is here where you can use the USB-C port in your center console or on your dashboard. You would plug in your smartphone just as you would if you were charging the device, but this also lets you pair it with your vehicle for one of the two hands-free play features. If your car lets you wirelessly pair your smartphone, you can most likely also still use the USB-C connection instead if you prefer, as this method will also charge your phone at the same time.
If you are dead set on wireless, but your car doesn't support it, there are also adapters you can buy that can plug into your car's USB-C port. These dongles can wirelessly connect your smartphone to your vehicle and let you use these features just as if you had a brand-new vehicle. Plus, there are many great adapters out there to choose from.
One gadget that more and more people have been considering to be a must-have for their vehicle is a dash cam. These are cameras that you can mount on your front windshield, and while that may seem like an odd piece of equipment at first, there are a lot of benefits to having a dash cam. For example, if you are in an accident, being able to capture the whole incident can give you a more accurate view on who exactly is to blame for the collision. You can also use it as a monitoring camera for when you are away from your car, capturing any wrongdoing that may be done around it. If you are going to have a dash cam, that camera is going to need power to operate, and this is where the USB-C port comes into play.
Dash cams have typically been powered by plugging the power cord into your car's cigarette lighter. But as USB-C becomes a more popular connection, more dash cams are hitting the market that let you connect to your vehicle that way. If your car is running, this connection will continuously power the camera without issue. However, if your car is turned off, your dash cam will need to have a parking mode enabled for this USB-C hardwire connection to still power the camera. Having this kind of connection also lets you easily switch from connecting to your car's USB-C port to an external power brick if you don't want to use your car's battery while it's off.
So many vehicles run on incredibly complicated software and firmware nowadays. Because they are so complicated, they often require periodic updates, just as you would do for your smartphone, laptop, or any other piece of tech in your life. For some vehicles, they are able to conveniently update these things over the air through Wi-Fi, but not every vehicle has the ability to do that. If that's the case, how else are you supposed to update your vehicle's firmware? Well, you have to do it yourself, and it can be done with the car's USB-C port.
If there is a new piece of software or firmware that your vehicle needs to be up-to-date, you can download it onto your computer. Once you have done that, you can plug in a USB-C drive into your computer and transfer that update to the removable drive. Then, head on over to your vehicle, and plug in that drive to the car's USB-C port. From there, you should be able to easily update whatever needs updating in your vehicle. This may be a bit of a laborious and annoying process, but it is very important business that needs to be attended to if you want to make sure that everything in your vehicle is operating as it should be.
All of the ways you can use your car's USB-C ports are fairly intuitive and address things that, so many people, require for their driving experiences. However, there are other fun ways that these ports can be of use to people that you maybe didn't think of. One of them is to provide power for LED lightning inside your vehicle. 
If you have been in an Uber or a Lyft in the past few years, you have perhaps come in contact with a driver who has transformed the inside of their vehicle into something incredibly colorful and bright. This is typically done with LED lights, be they individual bulbs or light strips. There are several ways you can get these kinds of lights in your car, and one of them is to purchase lights that operate by plugging them into a USB-C port.
If you want to give your vehicle a whole new color palette or simply add some accent lighting in certain parts of your car's interior, there are LED light strips that have a USB-C plug on the end of them, and if you plug them into your car, they light up. These LED lights can connect with your smartphone, so you can change the color to whatever you wish it to be or adjust the brightness to best fit your needs. Some even connect to music, so the lights can change color and pulsate to the rhythm of the song. While so many of the uses for a car's USB-C port are functional, sometimes it can be used for just a bit of fun too."
90,2025-11-30," Strategy CEO Phong Le says Bitcoin would only be sold if the company’s stock falls below net asset value and funding options disappear, calling it a financial decision. 
Strategy would consider selling Bitcoin only if its stock falls below net asset value and the company loses access to fresh capital, CEO Phong Le said in a recent interview.
Le told the What Bitcoin Did show that if Strategy’s multiple to net asset value (mNAV) were to slip under one and financing options dry up, unloading Bitcoin becomes “mathematically” justified to protect what he calls “Bitcoin yield per share.” 
However, he noted that the move would be a last resort, not a policy shift. “I would not want to be the company that sells Bitcoin,” he said, adding that financial discipline has to override emotion when markets turn hostile.
Strategy’s model hinges on raising capital when its shares trade at a premium to NAV and using that money to buy Bitcoin (BTC), increasing BTC held per share. When that premium disappears, Le said, selling a portion of holdings to meet obligations can be acceptable to shareholders if issuing new equity would be more dilutive.

The warning comes as investors scrutinize the company’s expanding fixed payments tied to a suite of preferred shares introduced this year. Le put annual obligations near $750 million to $800 million as recent issues mature. His plan is to fund those payouts first through equity raised at a premium to mNAV. 
“The more we pay the dividends out of all of our instruments every quarter, that's seasoning the market to realize that even in a bare market, we're going to pay these dividends. When we do that, they start to price up,” he said. 
Beyond balance-sheet mechanics, Le defended the long-term thesis on Bitcoin as a scarce, non-sovereign asset with global appeal. “It’s non-sovereign, has a limited supply… people in Australia, the US, Ukraine, Turkey, Argentina, Vietnam and South Korea — everyone likes Bitcoin,” he added. 
Related: Strategy unveils new credit gauge to calm debt fears after Bitcoin crash
Last week, Strategy launched a new “BTC Credit” dashboard to reassure investors after Bitcoin’s latest drop and a sell-off in digital-asset treasury stocks. The company, the largest corporate holder of BTC, says it has enough dividend coverage for decades, even if Bitcoin’s price stays flat.
Strategy claims its debt remains well-covered if BTC falls to its average purchase price of about $74,000, and still manageable even at $25,000.

91,2025-11-30,"Phillips 66 has lagged behind the Nasdaq Composite over the past year, but analysts remain optimistic about the stock’s prospects."
92,2025-11-30,"Belkin’s always been a top accessory maker when it comes to MagSafe and Qi2 products for iPhone users, and these accessories are no different. For Cyber Monday, Belkin is offering some pretty compelling discounts on some of its leading charging accessories. I’ll be sharing my impressions here.
Update 11/30: Added 10K Battery Bank and 4-port 108W GaN charger
First of all, it’s worth noting that these products are Qi2, and not Qi2.2. That means if you have an iPhone 16 or 17 model, this won’t be the fastest charging tech you can get. Granted, Qi2 accessories are more affordable than Qi2.2 ones, so there is a benefit there. You can check out my hands-on of Anker’s Qi2.2 and ESR’s Qi2.2 charging stands if that interests you.
Belkin’s 3-in-1 charging stand is a classic on the market, and for Cyber Monday, you can grab it for just $77 – around 30% off!
Its included non-removable charging cable is braided, which is a nice touch, there’s a 36W charging brick in the box.
As for the fit and finish, it isn’t too large, so if you have a tiny desk – you don’t have to worry about the footprint being too large. The MagSafe charging ring for the iPhone can also rotate, so if you need to adjust your iPhone a bit, that’s an option. It also comes with a nice silicone finish, rather than a glossy plastic. It looks quite nice.
For $77, it’s priced pretty affordably for a Qi2 3-in-1, and would make a great gift if this is what you’re after. It’s available in black and white.
If you’re after a larger than usual MagSafe power bank, Belkin’s 8K BoostCharge power bank could be a good choice for you. For Cyber Monday, you can grab one for 30% off at just $55.
Unlike a lot of options, this power bank comes with a kickstand. That’s rather nifty if you’re someone who wants to watch a YouTube video or whatnot while recharging your phone on the go. It also has LED charging indicators, and Belkin quotes up to 28 hours of battery life. The BoostCharge 8K comes with a USB-C charging cable in the box as well.
Since it’s 8K, it’s a bit thicker than usual, but it certainly isn’t overwhelming. You can pick it up in black or white.
In a lot of ways, this Belkin 3-in-1 charging pad is similar to AirPower in premise. Obviously, you don’t have universal placement, but you do get 3 devices charging at once on a flat wireless charging pad you can place on your desk.
It’s rather low profile, and the Apple Watch charger attaches via a separate USB-C connection. This has a dual benefit, since you can detach the Apple Watch charger to connect to a USB-C power brick or a MacBook for discrete charging without a lengthy cable in the middle. Also, if you don’t own an Apple Watch, you can plug in an additional cable for charging another device.
For Cyber Monday, you can purchase the 3-in-1 version for $65. If you’re not an Apple Watch user or would prefer a simple 2-in-1, you can save a bit and get it for just $38. It’s available in black or white.
This is a bit more niche of a product, but if you’re someone who wants a foldable MagSafe charging stand, this could be a neat product. For Cyber Monday, you can fetch one for just $25 – half off the typical price.
At that price, it comes with a USB-C charging brick and cable for that price, and just like everything else, supports 15W MagSafe charging.
If you’re someone who frequents coffee shops, works hybrid in office, or would otherwise like to have a convenient MagSafe charging stand you can easily fold up and throw into your bag – this is a great offering from Belkin.
Unlike everything else here, this isn’t a MagSafe accessory, though it’s still a nice pick. This is a 10,000mAh battery bank, offering an integrated USB-C cable in a rather slim package. I’d say it’s only slightly larger than a credit card in footprint.
It has LED charge status lights, charges with USB-C, and outputs up to 20W to fast charge your iPhone.
If you’re interested in Belkin’s 10K Power Bank, you can grab one for just $15 for Cyber Monday.
This one breaks the norm a bit, but if you just want one all-encompassing charger rather than dealing with 4 different charge bricks at your night stand, this could be a solution for you.
It offers 2 USB-C ports with up to 96W max. When you have two cables plugged in, it splits 65W and 30W respectively. The two USB-A ports can output up to 12W shared.
Personally, I’m not too huge of a fan of the fact that it has two USB-A ports, but I suppose if you have the right cables it can be alright for charging an Apple Watch or an older iPad.
If this 4 port 108W charger interests you, you can pick it up for 40% off for Cyber Monday.
The best Cyber Monday discounts for Apple products:

Bitcoin digital asset treasury (DAT) companies have been making headlines in recent weeks, and often for the wrong reasons.
A sharp decline in crypto markets and over 40% slump (as of Nov. 27) in the share price of the world's largest corporate holder of bitcoin, Strategy (MSTR), this year, has led some to question the sustainability of these companies.
Strategy’s steep underperformance relative to bitcoin (down about 2% this year) in recent months may be due to looming index-inclusion risk rather than crypto-market dynamics, according to Wall Street bank JPMorgan. However, the downturn in the share price of MSTR and other bitcoin DATs still raises the question: Is the bitcoin digital asset treasury model broken? 
According to Elliot Chun, managing partner at investment bank Architect Partners, it's the opposite. 
""This is the most exciting period for BTC DATs yet because in real time, we are seeing and will see which DATs will be able to successfully maneuver and communicate through this first 'macro' price move lower,"" Chun said in an interview with CoinDesk.
""We are still so early, as an industry, we haven't even properly categorized the DAT category yet, so it's impossible to say if the model is broken,"" he added.
Chun breaks the bitcoin DAT landscape into four broad groups now unfolding in real time. 
“Pure play"" DATs which direct nearly all corporate resources toward maximizing a bitcoin-denominated outcome, often BTC per share. “Producing"" DATs that actually generate bitcoin through operations like mining. “Hybrid"" DATs that treat the crypto as a primary pillar but still run non-BTC initiatives, and “participating"" DATs that simply hold the digital asset on their balance sheet and leverage it as a capital markets tool. 
As these categories experiment publicly, failures are inevitable, but according to Chun, that’s standard for any emerging corporate or capital-markets model.
What all bitcoin DATs must ultimately solve, Chun notes, is revenue: how to generate yield or cash flow, whether denominated in BTC or otherwise. And not all will make it. 
He expects that within five years, half of today’s pure play, producing and hybrid DATs will disappear through failure, delisting, mergers or acquisitions. 
About 35% will survive without outperforming, 10% will beat major market indices like the S&P 500, and the top 5% could challenge the Magnificent Seven’s decade-long run, returning more than 700% between 2025 and 2034, Chun said.
Can these companies withstand a true downturn? It depends on how one defines 'severe.' If the recent pullback counts, Chun expects most DATs to make it through. The real test will be deeper macro stress, where operational clarity, treasury discipline and a credible plan will separate survivors from targets.
So what comes next for this industry? Just like any other industry that rises in breakneck speed during a bull run and starts to crumble during a downturn, it's consolidation.
The firms blending TradFi discipline with bitcoin-native understanding will craft messages that resonate with investors and position themselves to raise and deploy capital effectively. And those that can’t, will be acquired, often by other DATs, Chun said.
Over the longer term, he expects the strongest performers to become acquisition targets for the world’s largest public companies as the bitcoin price marches toward $1 million and corporate treasuries increasingly view BTC as a strategic, rather than speculative, asset.

Finally, Google’s project to merge ChromeOS and Android into a next-gen PC platform has a name (or at least a codename) — Aluminium OS. I’m cautiously excited about the prospects of my favourite mobile OS on bigger screens, though we won’t see it in consumers’ hands until sometime in 2026, and there’s still a lot we don’t know.
Building a great modern laptop OS isn’t easy. Google will need to get the UI right, ensure excellent driver and peripheral support, make software easy to find and install (including tools outside its ecosystem), and work with reliable hardware partners. That’s a lengthy checklist — and we won’t know how well it’s been met until products hit the shelves.
But we do know a little bit about what the company has in mind for its next PC project — Google describes Aluminium OS as “built with artificial intelligence at the core.” Specifically, Google plans to bring its Gemini models, assistant capabilities, Android apps, and developer community into the PC domain. We’ve seen how well many Android apps work in a desktop environment, so many of the foundations are well underway, even if results vary with some apps.
If you like what Google has been doing with its latest Pixel smartphones, it sounds like you’ll be a fan of what’s in store for Aluminium OS. But the laptop market is already a well-established space; is there really any hope that Android for PCs can stand out? I think the timing is about as good as it’s ever going to get for Google to try to break out of its ChromeOS niche and into mainstream computing. Here’s why.
Regardless of how you feel about the seemingly unstoppable AI hype train, this is the way the wind is currently blowing. But so far, no one has nailed the formula in a way that’s super compelling for the PC market. Apple Intelligence is slowly replicating Google’s earlier AI feature set with new tools like “visual intelligence,” but it’s undoubtedly not racing to be an AI-first OS.
Microsoft’s Windows is in the midst of a more meaningful transition to an “agentic OS” platform, combining chatbots with context-aware assistance and file integration. From my experience with Snapdragon X and Copilot PCs, the benefits are still underwhelming — yes, even with Recall reinstated. The latest and upcoming Windows 11 updates intend to offer even deeper integration, but that’s a longer-term project, putting it on a path roughly parallel to Aluminium OS, where Google’s AI lead could give it a leg up over the world’s most popular laptop operating systems.
For starters, Google has already quickly integrated Gemini into Google Workspace, improving competitiveness with Microsoft 365 for home and some enterprise customers. Google has plenty of other Android AI features already lined up and ready to go, which could quickly find a home in the laptop space; Photos’ Magic Editor, Live Transcriptions for video calls, and Pixel Recorder-style audio summarization would be very competitive with, if not better than, what’s already found in the PC space. Furthermore, Gemini Nano works offline, giving Aluminium OS laptops the potential added advantage of having some of its better AI features available offline as well.
Even without knowing what Aluminium OS will look like, the sheer range of Android apps — alongside Google’s software suite, AI tools, and potentially Linux support — could make it an appealing option for home and educational laptops. Linux apps are already installable on ChromeOS and via the Linux Terminal for Android, but the setup could use further polish. However, it’ll have a far tougher time convincing enterprise customers to abandon Windows or creative industries to leap over to Mac, so I’m certainly not expecting anything close to an overnight switch.
If Aluminium OS goes beyond the basics, such as introducing phone-to-PC synchronization features akin to Apple’s Handoff or deeper cross-device continuity — shared clipboard, synced notifications, or seamless app handoff — then Google might be onto something much bigger. But that’s purely speculative; we’ve seen no plans for either of these wishlist features.
Hardware matters too, of course, and Arm-based laptops have gained traction in recent years for their potent combination of performance and energy efficiency. Apple’s M-series chips perhaps occupy the lion’s share of consumer consciousness, but Snapdragon X laptops offer similar benefits for Windows users. Google has partnered with Qualcomm on this joint project to bring Android to PCs, leveraging Snapdragon’s connectivity smarts and the benefits of an Arm-based architecture for improved battery life.
All of this hinges on the right price. Google appears to plan multiple tiers — “AL Entry,” “AL Mass Premium,” and “AL Premium” — covering laptops, tablets, mini-PCs, and more. If it can get a range of products out the door quickly, it’ll have a much better chance of appealing to mainstream consumers.
The bottom line is that I see a small window of opportunity for someone to shake up the laptop market a bit. Apple made progress with its shift away from Intel, but it lacks the AI leadership to push the envelope in a completely different direction. Microsoft has tried a similar approach but hasn’t quite nailed the software side of things either. Perhaps Google and Aluminium will be able to do just enough differently, and hopefully better than the competition, to squeeze through the narrow window to challenge the big two. I’m certainly not convinced the execution will be flawless (when are first-gen products ever that great). Still, I can certainly see the potential, and the timing is probably as good as it will ever be to break the laptop duopoly.
The counterargument here is that very few of us really care that much about AI, and that might make Aluminium OS a hard sell if that’s all it has going for it. While we’ll occasionally dabble in lighthearted edits and email spruce-ups, many are rightly far more sceptical about letting these tools screenshot desktops or pry into our DMs. Even fewer of us are willing to pay for the privilege of using AI, a significant challenge for anyone trying to base a product line on it — especially a brand-new venture entering competitive territory.
The fact of the matter is that AI hype primarily circulates around the same individuals and institutions in the upper echelons of the tech industry. General consumers are undoubtedly aware of it (how can they possibly avoid it these days), but convincing anyone to rip up the tools and platforms they’re familiar with will take more than repeating the same two-letter buzzword. What people really care about are price, ease of use, and brands they trust. Still, Microsoft executive Mustafa Suleyman has publicly expressed surprise that some view AI as underwhelming, and Google may be blinded by its own hype as well.
Many of us are content living outside the AI bubble and will probably continue doing so unless something undeniably game-changing comes along. On the other hand, enthusiasts (the very people who are likely to be Aluminium’s early adopters) are increasingly exasperated as Windows crams Copilot into every conceivable nook and cranny. Plenty share a similar sentiment about Google’s recent Gemini infestation in its cloud products. Understandably, power users don’t want pointless features that get in the way of the task at hand; they want tools that feel like real progress, and AI has probably scored more misses than hits in that regard.
Another round of promises about an “agentic” AI OS is likely to spark more eye rolls than excitement. Aluminium OS’s biggest challenge will be to convince us it’s not just another spin of the AI roulette wheel. It has to stand on its own as a capable, reliable laptop OS, with meaningful innovations that actually improve the way we work. Delivering that won’t be easy — but if Google gets it right, the payoff could be real.

Highly Tuned Athletes list on Everyday Market and Big W Market where cashbacks are currently up to $100, but they haven't dropped the price on the market places yet (only on their own website).
This model has the AMOLED screen, but is not the latest model which is the 570.  Long battery life, it's a watch for runners/fitness with some smartwatch features.  It has button control and touchscreen (which can be deactivated).
It is still cheaper to buy from amazon.co.jp or amazon.com, though if the right cashback deal comes up you can probably close to match the price for local stock.
Happy running!
