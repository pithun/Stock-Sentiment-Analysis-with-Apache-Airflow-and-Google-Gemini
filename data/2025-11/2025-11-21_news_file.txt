            Hot Stocks 




            A day after Thursday’s anxiety-inducing fake out, Friday turned into Redemption Day on Wall Street.
    

            The Dow ended the day 493 points higher, or 1.08%, after gaining as much as 800 points earlier in the day. The broader S&P 500 finished out the day 0.98% higher and the Nasdaq was up by 0.88%.
    

            The earlier bounce back came after New York Federal Reserve President John Williams said he supported lowering near-term interest rates, giving traders hope that they could get a December rate cut, after all.
    

            Friday’s gains cap a topsy-turvy and highly confusing week for markets.
    

            Going into Thursday, the sagging stock market had two big questions it wanted answered: Is the artificial intelligence bubble about to burst, and will the Fed cut interest rates in December?
    

            At first, it seemed like traders finally got the clear response they had been eagerly awaiting:
    

            Phew. Right?
    

            Wrong.
    

            Traders at first cheered Thursday morning, sending all three major stock indexes sharply higher. At one point, the Dow was up more than 700 points. But by late morning, the rally started to wear off, and sentiment – and markets – turned sharply negative by midday.
    

            Traders came to realize that the answers they thought they received actually just raised new, more difficult questions.
    

            “People are trying to figure out A.) What’s better than off the charts in terms of what Nvidia can say from here and realizing that there’s no reward at these levels and B.) how the Fed can cut if jobs numbers are really better,” said Michael Block, market strategist at Third Seven Capital.
    

            By the end of the day Thursday, it was like nothing had changed: Markets resumed their slide that has sent the S&P 500 down more than 5% from the all-time high it reached just before Halloween.
    

            Markets rebounded Friday, but Nvidia was essentially flat. Bitcoin dropped by around 2% to levels not seen since April and is on pace for its worst month since 2022.
    

            Nvidia’s quarterly earnings were so blow-out that investors began to fear that the world’s most valuable company and maker of the most precious commodity in tech – high-end AI chips – couldn’t possibly keep up this pace of growth for much longer.
    

            Eventually, demand will ebb. And even if it doesn’t anytime soon, the AI market isn’t just Nvidia – other, less powerful companies could still be overinflated. Perhaps, traders feared, Nvidia’s earnings didn’t actually answer any of their questions at all.
    

            Investors also looked more closely at a particularly confusing jobs report and realized it might not say exactly what they initially thought: The headline number showed much stronger-than-expected hiring in September, suggesting that the worst of the early-summer hiring slowdown may be behind us. The unemployment rate may have risen because more workers were entering the labor force, resuming their job searches after the summer lull.
    

            Williams’ glass appears to be half empty. But if the Fed takes a glass-half-full approach – particularly after minutes from its last meeting released Wednesday showed significant resistance to another rate cut in December – perhaps that rate cut won’t be coming next month, after all.
    

            So here we are on Friday, right back where we started. CNN’s Fear and Greed Index is in “extreme fear” mode and at its lowest level since – you guessed it – April. The VIX volatility index briefly spiked to 27, its highest level since… do we even need to say it?
    

            Until investors get satisfactory answers to their questions, expect more market volatility going forward. But with shutdown-delayed government data, an end to earnings season and traders about to go on vacation for the holidays, it’s not clear those answers are coming anytime soon.

Apple just announced its M5 chip a few weeks ago but this MacBook Pro with M4 Pro remains an incredibly powerful machine that handles almost all professional workflows with ease. This record low pricing at $1,749 on Amazon for the 24GB/512GB model, down from $1,999, makes it more compelling than most MacBooks currently available.
The model sits as the #1 best-seller among MacBook Pros on Amazon and the reason becomes clear when you consider the specs at this price point. Apple never runs discounts directly on its website or in its retail stores, so hitting up retailers like Amazon during Black Friday is the only way to score legitimate discounts on current-generation MacBooks.

The 12-core CPU splits down into eight performance cores and four efficiency cores and makes quick work of everything from video editing to the compilation of software. The architecture executes the resource-intensive tasks much faster compared to the previous M3 Pro, drawing less power in the process, which puts more runtime on your battery when doing intensive work. Real-world performance reveals stutter-free 4K video timeline scrubbing, instant photo filter application across hundreds of images, and code compilation that completes before you finish your coffee.
The 16-core GPU provides graphics performance that’s competitive with discrete graphics in much pricier Windows laptops. You can edit multi-layer 8K video projects, work with intricate 3D models, or run demanding creative apps like Cinema 4D without thermal throttling. Gaming performance is above expectations for a Mac, with AAA titles running at high settings and maintaining smooth frame rates. A unified memory architecture sees the GPU tapping into the same 24GB pool as the CPUÂ which diminishes bottlenecks normally associated with traditional discrete graphics arrangements.
The 24GB of unified memory handles professional workloads that choke systems with less RAM. You can have dozens of browser tabs open, run multiple creative applications at the same time, and switch between projects without any hint of slowdowns. The unified architecture means this 24GB functions more efficiently than traditional RAM since both CPU and GPU access it directly.
The display on the 14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR is capable of 1000 nits of sustained brightness and peaks at 1600 nits for HDR content. Mini-LED backlighting enables true blacks with excellent contrast that makes on-screen content pop. Color accuracy meets professional levels right out of the box, thanks to P3 wide color gamut coverage that will satisfy even photographers and video editors. The screen refresh rate of 120Hz courtesy of ProMotion makes scrolling feel butter-smooth and helps alleviate eye strain during extended work sessions.
That’s also 18 hours of video playback or about 12 hours of actual work mixing web browsing, document editing, and creative applications. You can work through a full day without hunting for outlets, and that transforms the way you approach mobile productivity. The MagSafe charging connection means that accidental cable yanks won’t send your laptop flying, and you still have both Thunderbolt ports free for peripherals.
Apple Intelligence integration brings AI features right to the operating system, from advanced text editing suggestions all the way to picture generation tools within native apps. All of these AI-related tasks are processed locally by the M4 Pro’s Neural Engine for data privacy and speed. These features keep evolving through new software updates, adding value during the life of the laptop.
You’re getting here a professional-grade laptop with M4 Pro performance for $250 less than Apple’s direct pricing, at $1,749. Similar Windows laptops are $2,500 or more and lack the efficiency and battery life that Apple Silicon delivers.

Most drone photography involves FAA registration, learning about Remote ID requirements and other regulatory hurdles before ever taking to the skies. However, the DJI Mini 4K weighs less than 249 grams which means it falls beneath the threshold requiring registration for recreational flights here in the United States (this is why it’s also among the most popular ones). You can purchase this drone, charge the battery and be flying in a matter of minutes-no paperwork or waiting periods required. The good news is,Amazon just dropped this to $239 for Black Friday, down from the usual $299, which marks the lowest price this model has ever hit.
See at Amazon
The footage from the 4K Ultra HD camera appears professional straight out of the drone. It features a resolution of 3840 x 2160 that retains sharpness whether you fly over landscape views, shoot action sequences, or close-up captures of subjects. The 3-axis gimbal mechanically stabilizes the camera, and compensates in real time for movements of the drone and turbulence of wind. This stabilization translates to smooth footage even when the drone shifts position-a quality that lacks in amateur videos taken by drones.
It operates well under a variety of illumination conditions, ranging from bright midday sun to golden hour sunsets and even low-light evening scenes. You are able to shoot sunrise footage without the blown-out highlights that cheaper cameras display, and sunset shots retain color saturation without losing shadow detail. Night shooting is also better than expected for a drone in this price range, although you will want to keep the shutter speeds reasonable to avoid excessive noise.
The 10km video transmission range gives you serious operational distance without losing signal. You can fly the drone far enough to explore large areas, follow moving subjects over extended distances, or capture sweeping panoramic shots. The impressive thing about the video transmission system is that it maintains quality across this range, so you see what the camera sees in real time without lag or pixelation. This range far exceeds what budget drones offer and matches what you’d find in models costing twice as much.
Wind resistance up to Level 5 conditions means the drone stays stable in 38kph winds. The brushless motors provide consistent power that maintains accurate positioning of the drone even when gusts hit. This capability is important if one flies over coastal areas, mountains, or any other place where the wind might suddenly change. It also enables takeoffs at altitudes of 4,000 meters or higherÂ which is useful for mountain photography or high-elevation adventures.
The 31-minute flight time from a single battery gives you enough airtime to set up shots, experiment with angles, and capture the footage you want without constantly landing to swap batteries. You can shoot thoroughly around a location or film an entire sequence uninterrupted.
GPS Return to Home automatically activates in cases of a low battery or if the connection drops. It flies back to its takeoff point and lands itself, hence avoiding crashes or lost equipment. It enables beginners who might lose their orientation or misjudge the battery levels to be at ease. One-touch takeoff and landing simplify operations, freeing you to work on capturing shots rather than managing controls.
QuickShots modes automatically handle complicated camera movements with pre-programmed flight patterns. Helix circles your subject while ascending, Dronie pulls back and up for reveal shots, Rocket shoots straight up, Circle orbits around a point, and Boomerang creates looping paths. These automated modes produce professional-looking results without requiring piloting skills or manual camera control. You choose the mode, select the subject, and the drone performs the shot.
You’re getting here a 4K drone with proper stabilization, extended range, and intelligent features for under $239-what most 1080p budget models cost. Its weight of under 249 grams eliminates requirements to register it, thereby removing barriers that stop people from trying drone photography. Besides its beginner-friendly controls and automatic safety features, this very much makes 4K quality accessible to anyone interested in aerial photography.

7,2025-11-21,"Oscar Isaac, star of Guillermo del Toroâs Frankenstein film, signs a lot of autographs. Prior to his role as the titular doctor in del Toroâs take on the Gothic horror classic, he was Poe Dameron in Star Wars, Duke Leto Atreides in Dune, and one of the alternate Spider-Men in Across the Spider-Verse. This man has been made into a Funko Pop several times over, and he clearly feels some type of way about them.Â 
He can probably spot an autograph reseller a mile away, too. That may be what happened when someone approached him outside of the Egyptian Theater in Los Angeles yesterday and asked him to sign some Funko Pops, to which Isaac replied, âNah, man, Iâm not doing those Funkos.â 
The POV recording, from the perspective of the Funko Pop wielder, showed the stranger holding out a Spider-Man 2099 Funko Pop after Isaac signs a Frankenstein poster from the back of a truck, then stepping away, slightly dejected after the denial.
11/16/2025 – On Sunday, I got a last minute tip that Oscar Isaac was going to be at the Egyptian Theatre, (I know I told you this through DM but thank you again!), (you know who you are lol), so I tried to get him to sign my Spider-Man 2099 Funko Pops along with a Moon Knight Funko and a Spider-Man 2099 mini poster for my sister, of course in the video you only see the pops, but unfortunately Oscar stopped for the kid Grapher to sign Frankenstein items but he didnât want to sign Marvel items. It was great to see him in person and honestly I donât blame him at all, it was a long shot especially after hearing that he isnât on good terms with Disney after that whole Kimmel incident but I was hoping he would sign the merch at least because imo he is still the most badass Miguel OâHara and Moon Knight out there, he makes both characters, Iâm sorry lol. Iâm definitely going to get backlash for that lol. But anyways, thought I would share my interaction with him, and if Oscar sees this somehow, Oscar I understand and hopefully one day I can still get your autograph on the Spider-Man 2099 as well as my sisterâs mini poster ! Oh and if Disney sees this, please fix things with Oscar, we need him back in marvel, there is no Moon Knight or Spider-Man 2099 without him. #spiderman2099 #OscarIsaac #fyp #Disney #Frankenstein 
 â¬ original sound – eladiioenrrique 
 
 
The Funko Pop collector, known as EladiioEnrrique on TikTok, alleged in the caption of his video that Isaac âdidnât want to sign Marvel items.âÂ Â 
âIt was a long shot, especially after hearing that he isnât on good terms with Disney after that whole Kimmel incident,â he wrote, referring to Isaacâs recent GQ interview in which he said heâd consider reprising his role as Poe in Star Wars only âif they can kinda figure out [how], you know, not [to] succumb to fascism.â He was referring to ABC and Disneyâs brief suspension of their late-night show host back in September after Jimmy Kimmel joked about the Trump administrationâs reaction to the assassination of Charlie Kirk.
Itâs not clear if Isaac was refusing to sign Marvel merch specifically or if he was just refusing to sign Funko Pops in general, as theyâre incredibly popular on the autograph reseller market. There are nearly 100,000 results for âsigned Funko Popâ on eBay, with many of them going for a few hundred dollars. Itâs now not uncommon for people like the owner of the aforementioned TikTok channel to follow celebrities around with several pieces of their respective merch in hand and ask for autographs, only to later try to flip them online for thousands of dollars.Â 
A different video from EladiioEnrriqueâs account shows a horde of people waiting for pop star Miley Cyrus to sign autographs. One person has all of her vinyls taped together in a vertical stack, while another has several items hung from a hangar, all to make a mass-signing as quick and painless as possible.
Most of EladiioEnrriqueâs channel is just first-person POV videos of him getting celebrities to sign records, CDs, and, of course, Funko Pops. His latest video says that he got a âlast-minute tipâ that Isaac would be at the Egyptian Theater before rushing over to get the signatures. But he’s not a reseller. “I am a collector,” he told Kotaku via TikTok DM. “I don’t resell my signed items simply because I don’t see it as right.”
“It’s definitely not my job, I know a lot of the graphers do actually do this for a living and go to eBay immediately to sell it,” he said when asked if he did this for a living. “I know this because I’ve seen their posts at times, but I can’t do it for a living, hell no.”
After Isaac refused to sign his toys, EladiioEnrrique stepped away politely and wrote a very understanding but hopeful caption for his video.Â 
âIf Oscar sees this somehow, Oscar I understand and hopefully one day I can still get your autograph on the Spider-Man 2099 as well as my sisterâs mini poster! Oh and if Disney sees this, please fix things with Oscar, we need him back in Marvel, there is no Moon Knight or Spider-Man 2099 without him.â it read.Â 
May all superfans be this well-adjusted.

Kirby Air Riders 
Well, that was fun while it lasted. Nintendo has taken down a Kirby Air Riders custom vehicle from its user-created store that depicts the seriesâ supporting character Chef Kawasaki in a bikini. As a result, fans are flocking to a similar hoverboard thatâs still on the marketplace before the company can ban that one, too.
Automaton reports that Japanese fans have been expressing disappointment online after the original custom hoverboard that was painted to look like Kawasaki in a micro bikini has been removed from the custom vehicle storefront. The design originates from a banned fan game and went on to become a meme in the Japanese Kirby community, so itâs entirely possible this is just an extension of Nintendo and Kirby developer HAL Laboratory trying to wipe the scantily clad chef from existence. However, as of this writing, thereâs still a bikini-wearing Kawasaki on the Air Ridersâ marketplace, though itâs not quite as revealing.

Following the banning of the first one, another bikini Kawasaki vehicle has raced to the top of the machine market’s most expensive vehicles, and it adds wings and a tail to make the guy look like a succubus. The other distinction is that the bottom of the two-piece is drawn to cover much more of Kawasakiâs nether regions, so this one may have escaped Nintendoâs ban hammer by making the chef slightly more modest.

16,2025-11-21,"The company’s stock has zoomed this year, driven by the explosive growth of the weight-loss drug market.
By Reuters
Share
Save
Eli Lilly has hit $1 trillion in market value, making it the first drugmaker to enter the exclusive club dominated by tech giants and underscoring its rise as a weight-loss powerhouse.
A more than 35 percent rally in the company’s stock this year has largely been driven by the explosive growth of the weight-loss drug market and saw it join the $1 trillion club on Friday.
Once seen as a niche category, obesity treatments are now one of the most lucrative segments in healthcare, with steadily rising demand.
Novo Nordisk had the early lead in the space, but Lilly’s drugs – Mounjaro and Zepbound – have surged in popularity and helped eclipse its rival in prescriptions.
The company’s shares were up 1.3 percent at a record high of $1,057.70.
Lilly now trades at one of the richest valuations in big pharma, at about 50 times its expected earnings over the next 12 months, according to LSEG data, reflecting investors’ belief that demand for obesity drugs will remain strong.
Shares have also far outpaced the broader United States equity market. Since the launch of Zepbound in late 2023, Lilly has gained more than 75 percent, compared with a more than 50 percent rise in the S&P 500 over the same period.
In the latest reported quarter, Lilly posted combined revenue of more than $10.09bn from its obesity and diabetes portfolio, accounting for more than half of its total revenue of $17.6bn.
“They are doing so many things outside of obesity, but to suggest anything is driving share price beyond obesity at this point, I don’t know if that would be a factual statement,” said Kevin Gade, chief operating officer at Lilly shareholder Bahl and Gaynor, in advance of the milestone.
Wall Street estimates the weight-loss drug market to be worth $150bn by 2030, with Lilly and Novo together controlling the majority of projected global sales.
Investors are now focused on Lilly’s oral obesity drug, orforglipron, which is expected to be approved early next year.
In a note last week, Citi analysts said the latest generation of GLP-1 drugs have already been a “sales phenomenon”, and orforglipron is poised to benefit from the “inroads made by its injectable predecessors”.
Lilly’s recent deal with the White House to cut prices for its weight-loss drugs, as well as planned investments to expand drug production, augur well for its growth.
Lilly is starting to resemble the “Magnificent Seven” again, said James Shin, director of Biopharma Equity Research at Deutsche Bank, referring to the seven tech heavyweights, including Nvidia and Microsoft, that have powered much of the market’s returns this year.
At one point, investors viewed it as part of that elite group, but after some disappointing headlines and earnings, it slipped out of favour.
Now, however, it seems poised to rejoin that circle, possibly even as an alternative for investors, especially given recent concerns and weakness in some AI stocks, he added.
Still, analysts and investors are watching whether Lilly can sustain its current growth as prices of Mounjaro and Zepbound come under pressure, and whether its scale-up plans, along with its diversified pipeline and dealmaking, will offset margin pressure.

17,2025-11-21,AI-driven review trims price target after recent volatility.
18,2025-11-21,"Written & Edited byOihyun Kim
Bitcoin’s recent price decline has revealed a sharp split in trading, with US sessions driving sell-offs while Asian traders steadily buy the dip. Data shows American sessions have become the weakest period for Bitcoin prices.
This divergence highlights contrasting risk appetites and sparks debate about whether Bitcoin is experiencing a healthy correction or facing deeper structural issues.
This week’s price activity reflects a clear trend: US trading hours show persistent losses, with European sessions experiencing smaller declines. In contrast, Asian-Pacific markets remain comparatively stable and often support price recoveries. Data snapshots underline the US trading window’s central role in recent market drops.
An X user commented, “Every single America session consists of relentless selling for hours. Then the Asians wake up and buy it all back until the Americans wake up. Like literal clockwork”. This interplay has become a regular feature of current trading dynamics.
The split may stem from differing risk sentiment across regions. US selling is likely due to caution over macroeconomic signals, policy changes, or liquidity. By contrast, many Asian traders view dips as buying opportunities, either because of confidence in Bitcoin’s outlook or because of varied investment approaches.
Liquidity and market depth factor in, too. US trading brings high volume, so broad selling can strongly affect global price moves. When American traders favor selling, global prices drop until Asian buyers step in and restore balance.
It’s also notable that retail investors are generally bearish, while whales are bullish and US institutions are bearish. The Coinbase Premium Index, which reflects US institutional sentiment, has remained in negative territory for almost the entire month of November.
On-chain analyst Ki Young Ju offers a detailed view of today’s market landscape. He notes that Bitcoin’s bull cycle technically ended earlier in 2024 after reaching $100,000. Traditional cycle theory would suggest prices drop toward $56,000 to set a new cycle low.
If you are not trading futures and only holding Bitcoin spot, this looks like a reasonable long-term accumulation zone. To be fair, from an on-chain cycle perspective, the bull cycle technically ended earlier this year when Bitcoin touched around $100K.In classic cycle…
Such institutional absorption creates a virtual price floor, since major holders with steady conviction are unlikely to sell during downturns. Traditional models assumed most participants might capitulate in a bear phase, but strategic corporate treasuries challenge that assumption.
Yet, some warn that concentration creates fresh risks. If institutions face financial stress or change strategies, any large sale could disrupt the market. So far, however, they remain committed to holding and accumulating Bitcoin.
Chris Kuiper, vice president of research at Fidelity Digital Assets, sees the recent correction in a positive light. He describes the drawdown as a standard adjustment in a larger bull market, not a sign that the cycle is over.
Kuiper’s analysis uses on-chain signals, such as the MVRV ratio for short-term holders. These stats indicate that the current price tests recent buyers’ conviction, echoing prior corrections that preceded further rallies. It shows that those who bought recently face unrealized losses before the market resets and trends higher.
Lack of negative headline events supports his interpretation. No significant regulatory action, exchange failures, or macro shocks have triggered the pullback. Instead, profit-taking and leverage liquidations after Bitcoin’s rally toward $100,000 appear to be the main causes.
Is this a local bottom for #bitcoin and other digital assets? I as well as anyone never knows for sure, but one chart I do like to use to help gauge the probabilities is the short-term holder MVRV chart along with their cost basis (first chart). Note that if this indeed is a… pic.twitter.com/B66onRgEgl
Traders now weigh two scenarios. The split between optimistic Asian buyers and cautious US sellers could be resolved if American sentiment improves or persists if global market structures shift further. Broader macro trends—such as government liquidity measures and regulatory changes—are likely to determine which path the market takes in the coming months.

19,2025-11-21,"After almost half a year on the market, I can finally recommend the Surface Laptop 13-inch to most people thanks to this incredible Black Friday deal that brings it down to just $549.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Well, that time has finally come. For Black Friday, popular retailers such as Best Buy and Amazon now have the Surface Laptop 13-inch with 256GB storage on sale for just $549. At $350 off its regular price tag, the Surface Laptop 13-inch suddenly makes a lot more sense.
The Surface Laptop 13-inch is a great laptop with an excellent design and desirable build quality, paired with a top-of-the-class keyboard and trackpad that feel excellent to type with. At this price of $549, it's a total no-brainer!
When the Surface Laptop 13-inch first launched earlier this year, I called it great in our review, but only if you consider it in a vacuum. That was because at its launch price of $899, it was just too expensive to recommend over something like a MacBook Air on a student discount. I said at the time that if you were interested in grabbing one, I'd wait for sales.
For $549 early Black Friday, you're getting yourself a good 1080p LCD touchscreen display, paired with the excellent Snapdragon X Plus SoC and 16GB RAM, making this one of our top Surface Deals this holiday season. The Surface Laptop 13-inch also has a premium build quality that's made out of aluminum, which is cold to the touch, and it's one of the best keyboards on the market. It also has a great mechanical trackpad that provides a satisfying click.
It's also Microsoft's best-rated Surface PC when it comes to battery life. It will easily see you through the day with no issues, thanks to the large 50Wh battery, which, when paired with the incredibly efficient Snapdragon X Plus, results in a laptop that just lasts and lasts.
I'd go so far as to say the Surface Laptop 13-inch at $549 is a no-brainer. You're not going to find a better laptop on the market at this price, especially with the build quality and attention to detail that Microsoft is so good at with Surface PCs. This is basically a $549 MacBook Air that runs Windows.
Yes, the Surface Laptop 13-inch features make it a Copilot+ PC thanks to an NPU that outputs 45 TOPS of power, which means it's fully capable of Copilot+ capabilities.
The Surface Laptop 13-inch is Microsoft's midrange alternative to its flagship Surface Laptop 7, which has a 13.8-inch screen. Differences include a better 120Hz display on the 13.8-inch model, more CPU, RAM, and storage options, a haptic trackpad, and Windows Hello face unlock instead of a fingerprint.
The deal will last for as long as stock is available, or until the end of Black Friday sales, whichever comes first. So you'll have to be quick!
The Surface Laptop 13-inch is a great laptop with an excellent design and desirable build quality, paired with a top-of-the-class keyboard and trackpad that feel excellent to type with. At this price of $549, it's a total no-brainer!

20,2025-11-21,"The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) decided not to investigate a £170m diamond scam despite receiving a report from a whistleblower almost a year before the scheme collapsed, BBC Panorama has learned.
Investors' cash was used to prop up Vashi Dominguez's diamond retail business, known as ""Vashi"".
After the firm went bust, a stock of diamonds supposed to be worth £157m - which investors had been told would act as security for their investments - was sold for £158,000.
The company's former chief technology officer contacted Panorama after we reported on the story in September. He shared documents that show he warned the SFO in May 2022 that Vashi was defrauding investors and falsifying accounts.
The SFO closed his complaint one day after receiving it, the documents show, and the company was allowed to continue raising money under false pretences until it collapsed with debts of £170m in April 2023.
The SFO told Panorama: ""When we don't progress a referral, we're not dismissing concerns about potential criminality. It simply means that it is assessed as not meeting the criteria for the SFO to investigate.""
Vashi Dominguez claimed to offer customers bespoke high-end jewellery at affordable prices. There were Vashi shops across the UK, including a flagship store in Covent Garden, central London.
The day the company went into liquidation, Mr Dominguez left the UK for Dubai. He has not been heard from since. Panorama has made several attempts to contact Mr Dominguez through various means but has not received any response.
John Ames joined Vashi as chief technology officer in July 2021. He first became suspicious of the company's activities a few months later, he says, when he saw financial claims being made on marketing documents given to potential investors as part of a fundraising round seeking £75m.
The documents claimed Vashi had made sales of £53.6m in the year 2020, while internal reports showed sales were really just £5.5m that year.
The marketing material also claimed monthly sales of about £8.5m up until August 2021, but internal records for the same period showed sales for the whole year of £5.5m.
Mr Ames told Panorama he began to ask Vashi management some awkward questions and then planned to leave the company.
In a video call from December 2021, recorded by Mr Ames and seen by the BBC, a senior manager confirmed he was happy with Mr Ames' performance.
But the following month, Mr Ames' contract was terminated at the end of his six-month probation period.
In May 2022, Mr Ames contacted the SFO via an online form and urged it to investigate Vashi - which is known by its full name of Diamond Manufacturers Ltd  at Companies House.
In the form, seen by the BBC, he wrote: ""I discovered [Vashi] to be defrauding their investors, they are also likely to be misstating information on their statutory reporting, both through inflated stock holdings and failing to provide details on revenue sources"".
If the SFO had checked Vashi's most recently filed accounts, it would have seen reported sales of £53.6m in 2020.
SFO documents obtained by Mr Ames through a subject access request, and seen by the BBC, show that although SFO staff believed Mr Ames to be a genuine whistleblower, they closed his case the following day without contacting him.
The internal document says: ""Source referred to AF [Action Fraud]"" - the UK national reporting centre for fraud and cybercrime, run by City of London Police.
But Mr Ames says he didn't hear back from the SFO or Action Fraud, and Action Fraud told Panorama it never actually received a referral about the case.
The SFO has now confirmed it did not pass on Mr Ames' referral.
""I thought I would get a phone call from someone, in shock and horror that this sort of thing was happening,"" Mr Ames says. ""I really did think somebody would take some kind of action.""
In May 2022, Mr Ames also reported Vashi to the Insolvency Service, the government agency that investigates liquidations but can also look at active trading companies and has the power to disqualify directors for misconduct.
It responded to Ames telling him: ""It is not appropriate to use the powers available to the Insolvency Service to investigate the company at this time.""
The Insolvency Service's letter to Mr Ames shows there was no meaningful referral to the legal authorities - although there was a link to the Action Fraud website at the end of the letter.
The Insolvency Service opened an investigation into Vashi the following year after the company's collapse.
Vashi continued trading for more than 10 months after Mr Ames's report to the SFO, as its owner Vashi Dominguez encouraged investors to pour millions of pounds into the business.
Advertising executive, Michael Moszynski, says he invested tens of thousands of pounds in December 2022, more than six months after the SFO had been warned about Vashi.
""Had the SFO done their job, I wouldn't have lost my money. I was astonished to see the lack of any follow up,"" he told the BBC.
John Ames says he contacted the SFO a further time, in September this year, following Panorama's investigation into Vashi.
Mr Ames says the SFO apologised for the delay in responding to his initial referral saying in a video call it was because of ""an administrative error"" due to an update made to the whistleblower referral platform in 2024.
However, Mr Ames told the SFO that he had made his report in 2022 - two years before this update to the platform.
The SFO told Panorama it investigates about 35 cases at any time and that they are the most complex economic crimes that specifically warrant its expertise and specialist powers.
""Fraud, bribery and corruption have a devastating impact on lives and livelihoods, and we are committed to tackling the most complex economic crimes to protect the public and our economy.""
It said it could not reveal the details of its ""internal assessment process"".
The Insolvency Service said it opened an investigation in 2023, after the company had gone into liquidation.
""It revealed irregularities that we were unable to clarify due to the principal director leaving the country,"" said a spokesperson. ""We have shared our findings with law enforcement partners.""

Low storage and slow speeds are something no one appreciates. Whether youâre a work professional trying to hit deadlines, a creative looking to push some boundaries, a student who wants to keep all their academic work close, or just a casual user hoping to browse and stream with peace, limited storage and lag can really kill your momentum.
Thankfully, you donât have to put up with that. An SSD can quickly take care of both problems for you, and these work with almost all devices out there nicely. The capacity range is wide; these typically start at 120GB and go up to 128 TB and more. 512GB and 1TB, however, are the most common sizes for general use. Samsung makes some of the best options on the market, and we just found a way to grab one for less.
See at Amazon
The brandâs 9100 PRO 1TB SSD, which typically goes for $200, is currently sitting at $135 at Amazon. Thatâs after a nice 33% discount, thanks to an early Black Friday sale. Itâs not just spacious, but offers much better speeds than its already-impressive predecessors. Itâs the lowest we have seen this reliable storage solution drop to in a long while, but the discount wonât last long. Early Black Friday deals are disappearing quickly, and weâre expecting this offer to wrap up fast too. Plus, thereâs no telling if the drop will be back for Black Friday, or if the stock will be up for grabs till then.
Starting off with what matters the most; the size. Youâre getting a massive 1TB capacity thatâs enough to house all your important data that you currently own, and still have a lot of space left for future downloads. You can throw in work documents, large creative projects, thousands of photos, hundreds of movies, tons of programs, and even a few games; all without feeling limited. While itâs great for basically any laptop/computer user out there, we highly recommend it for creatives who often go through the painful process of deleting old files to make room for new ones. That wonât be the case here; at all.
1TB storage capacity is more than enough for most users, but if it feels insufficient, there are 2TB, 4TB, and 8TB versions of the SSD, as well. These are currently going for $213, $370, and $750, respectively.
Speeds here are just as impressive. It supports PCIe 5.0, letting you tackle bigger-than-life projects with up to 14,700/13,300 MB/s sequential read/write speeds. This makes it twice as fast as the 990 PRO SSD, which is already one of our favorites. Random read/write speeds hit up to 1,850K/2,600K IOPS, which is more than enough for both heavy-duty and everyday tasks. You can expect much faster file transfers and quicker processing. Games will load in seconds, and you will be able to multitask with a bunch of different programs like a pro.
Best of all, stronger performance does not translate into overheating with this one. Thereâs a 5nm controller that boosts power efficiency up to 49% over the 990 PRO SSD, all the while its built-in advanced thermal control keeps temperature in check. You will also get access to Samsungâs Magician Software, which lets you keep an eye on the overall health of your drive, install updates, enjoy extra encryption, and more. Itâs an easy way to make sure everything is running smoothly.
The current deal brings the price of the Samsung 9100 PRO 1TB SSD down to just $135, putting it in quite an affordable range. Grab it while the offer is still live, and before the price shoots back up.

There’s no shortage of laptops in the market, but not every powerful laptop is a gaming laptop. Standard laptops (made for everyday work and casual use) prioritize features like battery life, decent display, and lower costs. Gaming machines, on the other hand, pack high-performance components that can let you game and work on creative projects without slowing down. These options typically have stronger dedicated GPUs and CPUs, faster RAMs, and a bigger storage capacity, but as you’d expect, they can cost a pretty penny.
Most solid options out there with all this and more sit well over $1,500, but that changes today. Amazon has kick-started its Black Friday and Cyber Monday celebrations already with some impressive early deals across a range of categories. As part of that, the retailer has also dropped the price of the 16-inch ASUS TUF gaming laptop by 32%. On a regular day, it would run you around $1,100, but you can snap it up for just $750 today. Honestly, that’s what most entry-level machines cost nowadays, which makes this offer no less than a steal. Of course, the stock is selling out fast, so there’s not much time left to save. If you have been wanting to upgrade your gaming experience for less, today is the day to make the move. In fact, this laptop can also be a great Christmas gift for a player in your life!
See at Amazon
There’s nothing too crazy going on with the design. The laptop looks and feels sturdy, plus comes with a subtle embossed TUF logo on its cover. The brand has thoroughly tested it to meet Military Grade testing standards, so you can expect it to handle everyday wear and tear well. Harsh conditions such as extreme temperatures, high humidity, and dirt won’t affect its performance one bit. But despite the sturdy, don’t-mess-with-me build, it’s lightweight enough to carry around easily. Take it to your office, nearby cafe, and even on some adventures without a worry.
Open it up and you’re greeted with a 16-inch Full HD display, which pushes immersive, detailed visuals. The 90% screen-to-body ratio gives you plenty of space to work and play. Color accuracy is excellent in all lighting conditions, making the content appear lifelike. The display also supports a 144Hz refresh rate to keep everything running smoothly, while the Adaptive-Sync technology actively reduces lag and minimizes stuttering for ultra-smooth gameplay.
Power is handled by an Intel Core i5 210H processor that’s paired with the underrated NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050. The GPU offers a significant performance boost over its predecessor and is a great entry-level option for those on a budget. Then there’s a modest 16GB RAM for increased efficiency. It’s not massive, but does a good job of handling everyday multitasking and most modern titles without throwing a fit. You will also be able to store all your favorite games and creative programs without feeling limited, thanks to the massive 512GB PCIe Gen4 SSD. And since SSDs offer much faster system boot and load times, you won’t have to wait long to get on with your day.
Best of all, despite powerful performance, the laptop does not overheat. ASUS has packed it with Arc Flow Fans, 4 exhaust vents, 5 dedicated heat pipes, and an anti-dust filter; all of which come together to keep things cool and quiet in the background as you teach some bad guys a lesson. There’s a lot more to like about this laptop, especially now that it’s going for just $750. The discount won’t be around forever, so it’s best to get your orders in fast.

""UBI is completely useless without things like antitrust law.""
Have you engaged with the idea that indexation solves inflation yet?
How come trust-buster Teddy Roosevelt failed to win more elections, and trusts came right back, stronger than ever?
Companies would normally be terrified to fire this many engineers because they'd be snapped up by competitors.Only there aren't any, because we keep voting for people that won't enforce anti-trust law.I do not think there are no competitors. There are plenty of competitors, but said competitors have ALSO been firing engineers left, right and centre. And that ""synchronized firing of engineers"" can not be stoped by anti-trust laws, but it can be slowed down by unionization.

This is true, a comment below here mentions at large companies like this that engineers don't innovate and a good case in point is Adobe.
Magento, Permia, Marketo, Allegorithmic, Workfront and if it wasn't for the EU they would have gone ahead and just bought Figma, an actual competitor that did something actual innovative. Once companies are big enough innovation is just buying your competition, particularly if you can get them before they can actually compete with you.
I've said it before but I am in favor 
If a company goes under them yeah another company can come along and buy their assets sure but a dying company isn't really competing or innovating is it? Companies go under all the time, the success rate in America is like 30% of all businesses and less for some areas.
Aquisitions have just been plainly anti consumer and anti worker in their outcomes; folks get laid off, prices go up, products get worse or just shelved entirely so the parent just catch and kills.

Plenty of acquisitions happen to stifle competition. They buy up a competitor and consolidate the industry.
Every once in a while you need a fake competitor and you get a big company propping up a failing business to give the appearance of competition.  Microsoft porting office to Apple hardware investing 150 million dollars and keeping them from bankruptcy.
> And that means you vote for politicians who'll do it. If you're American that means a Democrat.
You mean, like the Microsoft anti-trust case which was filed in 2001 when both President and House were Republicans and the Senate was 50:50?
Has there been any anti-trust case against big business since then? Maybe the Democrats did something but I can't remember anything like that offhand.
At this point, expecting elections to do anything just makes you look incredibly naive. It's clear that the only thing th 
If you're American that means a Democrat. Layoffs are ugly and devastating for impacted people. There is absolutely no reason to believe that Harris administration would have been any better. Point to me something in her platform that you believe would have made a difference in this situation.

Provocative FP, but I think you're mostly wrong and lacking in the kind of insight that will lead towards any solution. Most obviously, the Democrats are not going to solve anything. I think we are actually in a situation where too much change has become a key problem, so controlling and even limiting the changes are crucial.

Big tech companies don't really know what to do with 10x engineers.   1x engineers they manage out or warehouse until the next layoff, 1.5x engineers get promoted, but when they get a 10x engineer they try to make them into something different.  Typically this means taking them away from hands-on engineering and trying to get them to do things that are more ""high impact"", such as engineering management or tech leadership.  If they're not good at these things this frustrates everyone involved.  If they are... well, they've probably traded  a 10x engineer for a 1x manager or tech lead, which likely isn't a good trade.
Most employees at big companies, including tech companies, don't innovate.  They're not allowed to innovate, and if they try to do so they're told to keep working on their TPS reports or Jira tickets.  Laying off such engineers won't reduce innovation at a big company.
The people big companies allow to innovate are either product/marketing types, or in tech companies people with titles like ""principal"" and ""distinguished"".  Most of these people don't actually innovate either (and the innovation coming from the product/marketing types is usually bad), but occasionally you get people who can, and that's where all the innovation from big companies is.
If you want to innovate, become a founder.  If you're at a big tech company, you can probably ask management and they'll tell you the same thing.
Yeah... if you want to innovate, become a founder. That way you can create some cool new piece of technology that the one of the Mega Tech firms (likely Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, or NVIDIA) will buy up and eventually enshittify.
Nothing will really change, but at least you got your bag of money out of the experience.

Generally someone claiming they are a ""Professional Engineer"" or PE is where people can get in trouble if they have not passed certification. People who have engineering degrees cannot use that title until they pass certification tests. To get a certification requires passing 2 tests. The first test is administered near or immediately after graduation. The second test is after 5 years that but the engineer must have worked under the supervision of a licensed PE for those 5 years.

24,2025-11-21,"A never-before-seen 1996 interview
November 18, 2025
To mark Toy Story’s 30th anniversary, we’re sharing a never-before-seen interview with Steve from November 22, 1996—exactly one year after the film debuted in theaters.
Toy Story was the world’s first entirely computer-animated feature-length film. An instant hit with audiences and critics, it also transformed Pixar, which went public the week after its premiere. Buoyed by Toy Story’s success, Pixar’s stock price closed at nearly double its initial offering, giving it a market valuation of approximately $1.5 billion and marking the largest IPO of 1995. The following year, Toy Story was nominated for three Academy Awards en route to winning a Special Achievement Oscar in March. In July, Pixar announced that it would close its television-commercial unit to focus primarily on feature films. By the time of the interview, the team had grown by 70 percent in less than a year; A Bug’s Life was in production; and behind the scenes, Steve was using his new leverage to renegotiate Pixar’s partnership with Disney.

In this footage, Steve reveals the long game behind Pixar’s seeming overnight success. With striking clarity, he explains how its business model gives artists and engineers a stake in their creations, and he reflects on what Disney’s hard-won wisdom taught him about focus and discipline. He also talks about the challenge of leading a team so talented that it inverts the usual hierarchy, the incentives that inspire people to stay with the company, and the deeper purpose that unites them all: to tell stories that last and put something of enduring value into the culture.  

At Pixar, Steve collaborated closely with president Ed Catmull and refined a management approach centered on creating the conditions for talent to thrive. When he returned to Apple a few weeks after this interview, his experience at Pixar shaped how he saw his role as CEO: building a company on timeless ideas made new through technology.

The stock market is experiencing its worst November since the financial crisis of 2008. It spiked briefly Thursday morning because of a favorable third-quarter earnings report from the AI chipmaker Nvidia and a bizarrely robust jobs report for September. But in the afternoon it resumed its downward turn. There’s every reason to believe stock prices will continue to fall because—Nvidia or no Nvidia—we have an AI bubble that’s practically visible from outer space, and it’s bursting.
Meanwhile, Donald Trump’s approval rating, which has mostly been nosing down since his second inauguration, fell sharply during the past month to 38 percent, according to Reuters. That’s mirrored in a fresh Marquette poll that has the president upside-down on the issue of inflation by a score of 28 to 72 percent. Even Fox News puts his approval rating in the toilet.
Do these two November metrics—a falling stock market and a falling approval rating for Trump—measure a single phenomenon? It’s complicated.
I’m on record predicting a stock market crash and possibly a second Great Depression. I would love to be wrong, but at the least we’re headed into a bear market and probable recession. Yes, Nvidia is a $5 trillion company representing nearly 20 percent of the U.S. economy. But its stateside employees represent less than 0.01 percent of the U.S. workforce. 
Trump, meanwhile, will likely continue to lose popularity over the Jeffrey Epstein scandal; over his stubborn refusal to extend Obamacare subsidies; over a likely Supreme Court defeat on tariffs, which will cost the Treasury about $300 billion; and maybe over new revelations about what Mohammed bin Salman told Trump about the bone-sawing of Jamal Khashoggi. Even Marjorie Taylor Greene doesn’t love Trump anymore.
“Is Trump Starting to Correct His Course?” Karl Rove asked hopefully in a November 19 op-ed for The Wall Street Journal. Rove’s evidence was Trump backing down to allow release of the Epstein files and Trump removing tariffs from coffee and bananas (two commodities for which there’s virtually no domestic industry because the United States lacks the right climate). That’s two examples, both dictated by political necessity. Meanwhile our billionaire president mocks the word affordability and shushes a female Bloomberg reporter with the words, “Quiet, piggy.”
Is the stock market decline in lockstep with Trump’s polling downturn? On the one hand, yes: Obviously, as Americans grow pessimistic about the economy the president will become less popular. According to Fox News, voters now rate Trump slightly worse on the economy than they did President Joe Biden at the end of his term.
On the other hand, Trump started dropping in the polls in January, whereas the S&P 500, excepting a two-month drop in February and March, climbed through October, even as Trump’s tariff spree put the global economy in peril. To the extent there are underlying problems in the financial sector, many of these—a tottering private equity market, for instance, and the AI bubble—were evident well before Inauguration Day.
It would be difficult to dispute that the economy has stumbled on Trump’s watch. Inflation started rising immediately after Trump announced his “Liberation Day” tariffs. Job creation cratered starting in June and July. It rebounded in September, but we have no clue what happened in October and the Bureau of Labor Statistics says it can’t tell us because of the government shutdown. Future scholars may regard the October 2025 jobs report as elusive as “A Corona for Vivien,” the missing sonnet cycle at the heart of Ian McEwan’s new novel, What We Can Know.
Consumer spending has stayed high, but only because the top 10 percent in the income distribution was buying stuff; it now accounts, grotesquely, for about half of all spending. At some point, the coming bear market will shut that down. The metaphor of choice for the economy right now is a Jenga tower. Have you ever played Jenga? You take turns pulling rectangular blocks out from a tower made of them and piling the blocks on top until the whole thing crashes down. As the U.S. economy rests on fewer and fewer pillars—a handful of affluent consumers, a handful of tech companies like Nvidia—it wobbles more and more.
The leading edge of financial decline has been crypto. Bitcoin’s gains for the past year have been wiped out. Paul Krugman suggests that crypto is a “Trump trade.” With little utility as a currency except for criminals, crypto, Krugman argues, is a speculative investment dependent on Trump’s promotion of the industry. “An industry that’s still having very little success in finding legal use cases for its products basically bought itself a president,” Krugman wrote Wednesday. “But with Trump’s power evaporating, it’s starting to look like money down the drain.” We may see something similar soon in the construction of data centers, which is associated with parallel corruption in Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick’s family.
Krugman also notes that the partisan tenor of voter perceptions about the economy appears to be diminishing. “It may be that Trump is—bear with me here—actually paying a price for telling Americans not to believe their own eyes,” Krugman wrote Thursday. “Biden and company told Americans that their incomes were outpacing inflation, which was true but not what people wanted to hear. Trump keeps insisting that grocery prices are way down, which is simply a lie. And people may be noticing.”
Until now, the decline in the stock market has not been in lockstep with the decline in Trump’s popularity. But looking forward, they will very likely follow the same downward path. The good news is that we’re starting to witness Trump’s overdue political devaluation. The bad news is it will take a bite out of your 401(k).

28,2025-11-21,"The warning signs were there.
Long before guests found themselves abruptly kicked out of their ""Sonder by Marriott"" stays this month, Sonder, the Airbnb rival, was battling sloppy accounting, a litany of lawsuits, and a stock price so low it was nearly delisted from the Nasdaq.
Bankruptcy filings and SEC records show just how stark the signs were — and raise questions about why Marriott, the world's biggest hotel chain, got into bed with the one-time unicorn.
The San Francisco startup, founded in 2014, leased apartments and hotel rooms in bulk, redesigned them with a minimalist aesthetic, and rented them to travelers. It's the brainchild of Canadian Francis Davidson, who is the ideal of a 2010s founder: VC-backed, college dropout, Forbes 30 Under 30. He offered a ""revolutionary"" promise: Goodbye, poorly decorated Airbnbs with quirky hosts. Hello, streamlined rentals managed with modern technology.
In August 2024, he unveiled his pièce de résistance: a deal between Sonder and blue-chip Marriott, which was heralded as a way to bring that vision into the future.
""Making this deal happen — along with the multi-party, complex capital raise I orchestrated — was the hardest thing I've ever done,"" former CEO Davidson wrote in June.
At the time, analysts lauded the deal, noting that it would add 9,000 rooms to Marriott's portfolio — a key figure for the hotel giant's valuation. Sonder said after the deal closed it would reduce costs by as much as $50 million.
Looking back, the Marriott deal was maybe less of a legitimization and more of a Hail Mary. Since going public at a $2 billion valuation in 2021, Sonder had faced layoffs, lawsuits, and a slew of executive departures, including Davidson.
""Marriott, no lie, they saved the company last year with their agreement,"" Logan Ford, who worked in sales at Sonder before being laid off last week, told Business Insider.
The $76 billion hotel giant didn't come to Sonder's rescue again. In court filings for Sonder's bankruptcy case, Marriott said that after it helped cover about $1.5 million in payroll, Sonder pressed the company for as much as $50 million to pay for shutdown operations. Marriott declined, and shortly afterward, signs appeared on the doors of Sonder properties telling guests to vacate.
Thousands of customers were suddenly left with no place to sleep.
Now, some in the industry are questioning how Marriott missed the warning signs. ""I don't know how anyone with any iota of business sense could have thought that this was a good idea,"" said Alan Reay, president of Atlas Hospitality Group, a California brokerage firm that tracks hotel ownership and financing trends.
""The Marriott partnership is what essentially kept the company afloat for the next year,"" Ford said — and when it ended, there was nothing left.
Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today.
At the height of COVID-19, Sonder laid off a third of its staff and had been sued for allegedly bailing on leases, a claim that Sonder denied and for which litigation is ongoing.
In 2021, the company, which gained unicorn status two years earlier, announced it was going public via a SPAC at a $2.2 billion valuation. SPACs — or special purpose acquisition companies — offered what many startups saw as a quicker, less scrutinized path to going public than a traditional IPO.

Sonder had survived while competitors like Lyric folded, and was now on its way to becoming an ""iconic 21st-century brand,"" then-CEO Davidson told Business Insider at the time.
""This kind of financial discipline, with a really rapid response to the pandemic, has meant that we've been able to outperform a lot of the competition and be in a relatively strong position,"" Davidson said.
Its public market debut was lackluster. On its first day of trading, Sonder's stock dipped 8%.
Its downward spiral continued. Shares traded under $1 for much of the following year, leading the Nasdaq to threaten a delisting.
There was another round of layoffs — this time 17% — in 2024, and Sonder was hit with lawsuits accusing it of not paying rent or properly managing its buildings.
One New Orleans hotel that Sonder managed, the 100-year-old Jung Hotel, alleged that the startup had tarnished its reputation. There wasn't enough security, which led the hotel to become a ""magnet for violent crime"" and a ""warzone,"" the landlord said in the lawsuit. The hotel was also not properly cleaned, with toenails in the bed sheets and blood on the linens, the complaint said.
Sonder disputed the claims, and the lawsuit was settled, as was a 2022 lawsuit Sonder filed against the Jung Hotel's owner at the time.
""SCAM- NOT AN OPERATING HOTEL,"" one online review read, according to the Jung Hotel's 2023 complaint. ""Just another short term rental place poorly taken over by Sonder. You've been warned.""
A hotel in San Francisco sued, saying Sonder wasn't paying its rent and owed more than $1.2 million as agreed upon in a lease termination agreement. Sonder denied the claims, and the lawsuit was settled.
The company's accounting also had problems. In 2024, Sonder revealed in an SEC filing that its financial records since its debut as a publicly traded company could not be trusted after being reviewed by an auditor.
The stock fell 38%, and Sonder said in filings that it was asking lenders not to call in loans or otherwise punish the company for the errors.
Despite that, Marriott took a chance. Six months after its announcement of two years of unreliable financial reporting, Sonder announced its deal with Marriott. All of Sonder's properties would now fall under the ""Sonder by Marriott Bonvoy"" branding.
""When we did the deal back in August 2024, everyone around the table was aligned that plugging into Marriott's distribution should increase revenues for Sonder,"" Davidson told Business Insider this week. ""The fact that in the end there was seemingly a decline comes as a great surprise, I think, for all parties involved.""Sonder declined to comment on the record.
Sonder's rooms allowed Marriott to boost its ""net unit growth,"" or the number of rooms it can rent, a key metric followed closely by investors and Wall Street analysts. The Sonder deal allowed it to add 9,000 units to its portfolio, it said when it announced the deal.
For Sonder, it provided desperately needed cash. Marriott would pay Sonder $15 million in ""key money"" as part of the deal.
Some in the hotel industry said they were surprised at the deal. Reay of Atlas Hospitality Group said it ""absolutely made no sense.""
""Whoever did the due diligence, whoever did the underwriting on this, if they're still at Marriott, I'd be surprised,"" he said, comparing Sonder to a WeWork-style implosion waiting to happen.
Robert Rauch, a hotel consultant and Marriott franchisee, said the company's confidence in its own brand perhaps clouded its judgment. He called Marriott ""a great company"" that is ""vertically integrated better than any company I've seen,"" but said its deal with Sonder was ""a bad risk.""
A Marriott spokesperson declined to comment.
Multiple people familiar with Sonder said the Marriott deal sustained the company.
""The Marriott agreement a year ago is actually what kept us from bankruptcy,"" Ford, the sales employee, said.
Even still, Sonder was in a precarious position.
""Management has concluded that there is substantial doubt, which is not alleviated, about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year,"" it wrote in a November 2024 filing. One year after the filing, Sonder was out of business.
By this November, Sonder was drowning in debt, nearly out of cash, and out of options, according to legal filings.
Sonder had been negotiating for emergency financing and a potential buyer to take over its assets in bankruptcy, but the bidder abruptly pulled out on November 2, the filings said.
Three days later, Marriott agreed to provide Sonder with about $1.5 million in funding to cover one week of US payroll, the hotel chain said in filings in Sonder's bankruptcy case, calling it a short-term move to help keep thousands of guests housed.
The ""ink was barely dry"" when Sonder, on November 6, sent Marriott a $50 million proposal for Marriott to cover the costs of winding down Sonder, according to bankruptcy filings. The hotel giant said it rejected that plan, along with two other revised proposals for $28 million and $14 million.
Marriott accused Sonder of trying to ""leverage guest safety as a bargaining chip"" in order to get money out of it.
Sonder threatened that ""unless Marriott financed its wind-down, it would shut down hotel systems and leave thousands of guests locked out of their rooms mid-stay,"" Marriott alleged in bankruptcy papers.
On November 7, Marriott terminated its 20-year license agreement after Sonder told Marriott it faced an ""imminent free-fall liquidation."" Marriott said in court filings that this allowed it to take over guest support and begin rebooking travelers.
The move left guests scrambling, forcing many to leave their stays with little warning.
Marriott said Sonder notified customers that it would no longer honor their reservations and advised them to contact Marriott regardless of whether they had booked stays outside Marriott's platforms. Sonder, which reported having over 1,400 employees at the end of 2024, also laid off all staff the same day without severance.
On November 10, Sonder announced its Chapter 7 bankruptcy plans.
In its press statement, Sonder blamed financial strain, technical problems integrating with Marriott's booking systems, and a sharp drop in bookings from Marriott's Bonvoy program. Marriott, in turn, said the collapse stemmed from Sonder's own mismanagement.
""Sonder collected tens of millions of dollars in advance payments for reservations it now admits it will never honor, spent weeks on a failed restructuring without any contingency plan, and failed to reserve sufficient liquidity to support an orderly wind-down,"" Marriott said in a bankruptcy filing.
The company, Marriott claimed, used guests' advance payments and deposits to bankroll its own operating expenses.
Amid the fallout, Marriott tried to distance itself from Sonder.
""It's important to understand, and I think it's important for the public to understand, that there was a license agreement, and, quite frankly, nothing more between Marriott and Sonder,"" an attorney for Marriott told a Delaware bankruptcy judge this week.
Sonder managed and operated its thousands of apartment-style and boutique hotel short-term rental units around the globe — not Marriott, the lawyer emphasized.
For Marriott, the end of the deal was a black eye as news stories and social media were flooded with stories of travellers left without options and being given conflicting advice.
For Sonder, it was the end of the line.

The battle for Warner Bros. Discovery has officially begun. But for all the talk about Paramount Skydance, Comcast could be the most motivated bidder.
Many in Hollywood have assumed for months that David Ellison's Paramount has the inside track. Ellison seems to have a strong relationship with President Donald Trump and is backed by his father Larry Ellison's astronomical wealth.
However, Comcast and Netflix are also suitors for WBD's movie studio and streaming business. And while Netflix may not need those assets, several media analysts believe Comcast does. Rich Greenfield of LightShed Partners led this charge with a trio of late October notes, and he's far from alone.
""We believe it's time for Comcast Chairman and CEO Brian Roberts to make a bold move to change the narrative around Comcast,"" Greenfield wrote. He also said buying WBD would be ""a once-in-a-generation opportunity"" for Roberts and Comcast.
Brandon Katz of entertainment data provider Greenlight Analytics also thinks the NBCUniversal parent needs WBD. He told Business Insider that ""it's clear that NBCU has the most to gain in raw streaming upside from a WBD acquisition.""
If NBCU and Peacock's parent company can add Warner Bros. Studios and HBO to its arsenal, it could become a media powerhouse that could challenge the likes of Disney.
""Comcast has always had Disney envy, and now it has a clear opportunity to create a Disney-like story, with an asset mix that could be even more compelling than Disney,"" Greenfield wrote.
Comcast declined to comment, and WBD didn't respond to requests for comment.
Both Comcast and Paramount would greatly benefit from integrating HBO Max, said Joe Bonner of Argus Research.
But Peacock may need it more. Comcast's flagship streamer is US-only and has been stuck at 41 million subscribers for three straight quarters, while Paramount+ is global and has grown steadily to 79.1 million subscribers. Both streamers could use a viewership boost, with roughly 1.5% to 2% of US TV viewership each, according to Nielsen.
Veteran media analyst Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson told Business Insider that HBO Max is ""the most obvious partner"" for the ""inarguably sub-scale Peacock.""
""It's hard to call any asset 'must-have,' but HBO Max and the studios would be a great fit for Comcast,"" Moffett said.
Peacock may be the best dance partner for HBO Max, since only 20% of HBO Max subscribers in the US also have Peacock, according to Greenlight Analytics. The firm also found that 40% of HBO Max customers pay for Paramount+ and two-thirds have Netflix.
The limited overlap across Peacock and HBO Max means a bundle between the two may drive more incremental revenue than a tie-up with Paramount+ or Netflix could.
Comcast has also shown its commitment to the streaming wars by spending heavily on NBA and MLB media rights and luring star showrunner Taylor Sheridan away from Paramount.
""They must have something cooking beyond just the hopes of landing the studio and streamer side of WBD,"" Katz said. ""The massive outlay for sports rights alone doesn't make sense for US-only distribution.""
Outside streaming, Comcast could save a boatload by owning both Universal Pictures and Warner Bros. Studios.
""NBCUniversal should have greater synergies with Warner Bros. Discovery, given far less cost-cutting than has been done at Paramount or Warner Bros. in the past five years,"" Greenfield wrote.
Buying WBD could jump-start Comcast's streaming business and its stock price, both of which have been stagnant.
Comcast isn't a perfect bidder for WBD, however. Like Netflix, it's only interested in WBD's studio and streaming business, since it's spinning off most of its cable TV networks, while Paramount wants all of WBD. Comcast (or Netflix) would have to convince WBD's board that selling just the movie studio and streamer, and keeping the declining TV networks, would be a better outcome than offloading the whole company to Paramount.
Unlike the Ellison-backed Paramount or cash-gushing Netflix, Comcast also may be limited by its languid stock and hefty debt load. Moffett said that Comcast's price-to-earnings ratio is the lowest of any S&P 500 stock, so a big deal ""is probably out of Comcast's reach.""
Still, the market caps of Netflix ($446 billion) and Comcast ($100 billion) are a lot bigger than Paramount's $17 billion.
Another potential headache for Comcast is the regulatory process, as Trump has spoken negatively about Roberts and the company — which owns the left-leaning TV network MS NOW — in the past.
""It's hard to imagine that this administration would greenlight a deal over what they could, or would, claim to be antitrust concerns,"" Moffett said.
Comcast could be very motivated to figure out a way forward, as losing out on WBD could leave ""Peacock stranded without an obvious merger partner and at a meaningful content deficit,"" Greenfield wrote. He thinks Comcast could secure regulatory approval to buy WBD by placating Trump. The media giant recently donated to Trump's new White House ballroom project.
Comcast has a history of shaking up bidding wars, as WBD found out during the NBA media rights negotiations. If the cable giant decides it needs WBD, Ellison shouldn't be surprised if securing his prize is harder than he anticipated.

Make the most of your seafaring Blox Fruits adventures with details on the different vendors’ stock and the restock times.

If you are an ardent Blox Fruits player, the ocean-faring Roblox experience that has taken the world by storm, then you will want to keep a keen eye on the many stock options scattered around the Blox Fruits seas. Those titular fruits are the keys to success, but not only are some rarer than others, but vendors constantly change their wares, so we’re here to explain everything you need to know about the Blox Fruits stock as well as restock times.
The most important part of Blox Fruit is, unsurprisingly, those titular Blox Fruits. If you want to expand your collection, you will need to amass some money through regular gameplay and then head to a vendor to buy Blox Fruit.
Sadly, not all of the Blox Fruit are available at once, and their appearance is dictated by their rarity. So, you’re much more likely to see common Blox Fruit than you are rare ones. Anyone wanting to expand their abilities or collect all of the Blox Fruit will need to routinely visit the in-game vendors with the hopes of eventually finding and purchasing every Blox Fruit in the game. Regular vendors have at least three Blox Fruit, while the Advanced Fruit Dealer on Mirage Island holds five.
The regular Blox Fruit stocks offered by Normal dealers change every four hours. Meanwhile, the Advanced dealers change their stock every two hours instead.
The Blox Fruits vendors' stock refreshes at a set time depending on your region. So, every four hours, or at one of the times listed below:
There is no way to find out ahead of time which Blox Fruits will be stocked by the Normal Dealer or the Advanced Dealer. However, you can use third-party websites and apps to see exactly which Blox Fruits are in stock at the current moment in time.
If you want to check the Roblox Blox Fruit stock, you will have to find and interact with any of the many dealers within the game. If you are looking for a particular fruit, or just want to make checking stock easier, you can save next to a dealer and then respawn next to them, to save yourself a journey.

32,2025-11-21,"The draft US-Russia peace plan has been widely leaked and we now know that it proposes to hand over those areas of Ukraine's industrial eastern Donbas region still under Ukrainian control to the de facto control of Vladimir Putin's Russia.
Latest versions of the text also call for Ukraine to cut the size of its armed forces to 600,000 people.
But what else is known about the text and who stands to benefit from it most?
There are 28 key points and there are several on the face of it that could be acceptable to Ukraine. Others come across as vague and imprecise.
Ukraine's sovereignty would be ""confirmed"" and there would be a ""total and complete comprehensive non-aggression agreement between Russia, Ukraine and Europe"", with robust or reliable ""security guarantees"" for Kyiv and a demand for snap elections in 100 days.
If Russia were to invade Ukraine a ""robust co-ordinated military response"" is proposed along with a restoration of sanctions and a scrapping of the deal.
Although elections are impossible in Ukraine as there is martial law in place, they could theoretically be held if a peace deal is signed.
But on security guarantees, there is no detail on who would provide them and how robust they might be. This falls well short of a Nato-style Article Five commitment to  treat an attack on Ukraine as an attack on all. Kyiv would want more than a vague promise if it were to sign up.
Among the most contentious proposals are Ukraine handing over its own unoccupied territory and cutting the size of its armed forces.
""Ukrainian forces will withdraw from the part of Donetsk Oblast that they currently control, and this withdrawal zone will be considered a neutral demilitarized buffer zone, internationally recognized as territory belonging to the Russian Federation. Russian forces will not enter this demilitarised zone.""
Ceding territory where at least a quarter of a million Ukrainians live - the Donetsk ""fortress belt"" cities of Slovyansk, Kramatorsk and Druzhkivka - will not be acceptable to most Ukrainians. Russia has spent well over a year trying to capture the town of Pokrovsk - Ukraine is unlikely to hand over such important strategic hubs without a fight.
""The size of the Ukrainian Armed Forces will be limited to 600,000 personnel.""
Ukraine's military was estimated last January at 880,000 active personnel, up from 250,000 at the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022.
While 600,000 might seem a potentially acceptable number in peacetime, that kind of limitation would infringe on Ukrainian sovereignty. It might also be too big a number for Russia to accept.
""Our red lines are clear and unwavering,"" Ukrainian representative Khrystyna Hayovyshyn told the UN security Council: ""There will never be any recognition formal or otherwise of Ukrainian territory temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation as Russian. Ukraine will not accept any limits on its rights to self defence or on the size or capabilities of our armed forces.""
The draft also proposes that ""Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk will be recognized as de facto Russian, including by the United States"".
In other words Ukraine and other countries would not need to recognise Russian control by law. That could enable Kyiv to accept such phrasing, as it would not impinge on Ukraine's constitution that says its borders are "" indivisible and inviolable"".
Elsewhere, in the southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzia, the front lines would be frozen and Russia would relinquish areas it has occupied elsewhere in Ukraine.
The draft proposes significant commitments on Ukraine's strategic future:
""Ukraine agrees to enshrine in its constitution that it will not join Nato and Nato agrees to include in its statutes a provision that Ukraine will not be admitted in the future.""
""Ukraine is eligible for EU membership and will get short-term preferred market access to the European market while this issue is being evaluated.""
There is little chance of Ukraine joining Nato any time soon and Russia has in recent months softened its stance on Ukraine's candidacy for EU membership. The document appears to offer Kyiv access to EU markets while ignoring the views of 27 European countries. 
Joining both the EU and Nato are part of Ukraine's constitution and another of Khrystyna Hayovyshyn's red lines at the UN on Thursday was: ""Nor will we tolerate any infringement on our sovereignty including our sovereign right to choose the alliances we want to join.""
Other draft proposals are that Nato agrees not to station troops in Ukraine and that European fighter jets will be stationed in Poland. Kyiv would also have to commit to being a ""non-nuclear state"".
That appears to reject the West's Coalition of the Willing's plans led by the UK and France to help police any future deal.
Several points refer to Russia being brought back from isolation with ""Russia to be re-integrated into the global economy"" and invited back into the G8 group of powers. 
That seems a long way off for now, with Putin under an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court. Russia was thrown out of the G7 after it seized and then annexed Crimea in 2014 and Trump tried to bring Putin back into the fold six years later.
If the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan were reluctant before the full-scale invasion, there's even less chance of that happening now.
The draft proposes that $100bn of frozen Russian assets should be invested ""in US-led efforts to rebuild and invest in Ukraine"", with the US receiving 50% of the profits and Europe adding $100bn in investment for reconstruction.
This is reminiscent of the US minerals deal with Ukraine earlier this year, extracting an American price for involvement, and it also leaves the European Union with nothing but hefty bills.
The sums it mentions may not be sufficient, either: earlier this year the total cost of reconstruction in Ukraine was put at $524bn (€506bn).
Some €200bn in Russia frozen assets are largely held by Euroclear in Belgium, and the European Union is currently working on a plan to use the money to fund Kyiv financially and militarily.
The rest of those frozen assets would go to a ""US-Russian investment vehicle"", under the draft, so Russia would see some of its money come back, but again there would be a financial benefit for the US.
Several commentators have pointed out that the plan does not require weapons limitations on Ukraine's military or its arms industry, even though there is a provision saying: If Ukraine fires a missile at Moscow or St. Petersburg then the security guarantee will be considered null and void.
But it does not place an restriction on the long-range weapons Ukraine has been developing - such as its Flamingo and Long Neptune missiles.
We know the US is keen to press ahead fast under an ""aggressive timeline"" with this draft, with reports suggesting Ukraine has until Thanksgiving late next week to agree to it.
Equally US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was involved in drafting it, described it as ""a list of potential ideas for ending this war"", and German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has made clear he does not see the 28 points as a definitive plan, having spoken to the other key US official involved, Trump envoy Steve Witkoff.
In some respects the draft document seems like work in progress, with some details that were leaked to US websites on Thursday no longer apparent. 
The European Union said on Friday morning it had not officially seen the plan yet, and the Russian foreign ministry said the same.
Russian special envoy Kirill Dmitriev is known to have spent as long as three days with Witkoff discussing this plan, raising suggestions of a stitched-up deal to suit Moscow. Russia's response has so far been cautious but Putin has said it could be the ""basis"" for a peace settlement.
The handover of Ukrainian territory to Russia, even in a demilitarised zone, is the biggest sign of a slant towards Russia's narrative, but freezing the front lines in the south could prove difficult for the Kremlin which has annexed both Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in its constitution.
One of the proposals is for the lifting of sanctions to be ""agreed upon in stages and on a case-by-case basis"" - which Moscow will probably see as far too slow.
However, a plan for a ""full amnesty"" for all parties will go down well in Moscow and very badly in Kyiv and European capitals.
Commentators have pointed out that while there do appear to be major concessions to Putin, some of the requirements for Nato might be too vague for Kremlin tastes.
Russia has also consistently demanded that a peace plan would need to eliminate what it sees as ""the root causes"" of the war. One of those root causes is halting Nato expansion in Eastern Europe, which the draft appears to deal with.
Some of the other 28 points of the draft also nod to Russia's claims of discrimination against Ukraine's Russian-speaking population without explicitly endorsing them. 
One point is explicit but even-handed: ""Both countries will agree to abolish all discriminatory measures and guarantee the rights of Ukrainian and Russian media and education.""
Another apparent attempt to be even-handed comes from a proposal to distribute electricity generated by the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant - the biggest in Europe - ""equally between Russia and Ukraine"".
Nathan Gill, 52, is sentenced to 10 and a half years in prison after admitting taking bribes while an MEP.
The new army chief of staff divides political opinion with speech about potential conflict with Russia.
The former leader of Reform UK in Wales has admitted bribery and will be sentenced on Friday.
The draft provisions come across as heavily slanted towards Moscow, but Volodymyr Zelensky says he is ready to work with the US.
The US is working to a quick timetable to push through the deal, which appears to heavily reflect many of Moscow's demands.

33,2025-11-21,"Battlefield 6 has sold better than any other game this year, and has had a wildly successful launch month.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Following its explosive launch last month, something immediately clear to pretty much everyone was that Battlefield 6 — Electronic Arts (EA) and Battlefield Studios' latest entry in the beloved multiplayer FPS series — had rapidly become one of the most popular games of the year. After all, it released to 750K concurrent players on Steam alone, and managed to sell a whopping 7 million copies in just three days.
Following all that initial success, the Battlefield devs went on to claim that it's the ""best-selling shooter game of the year,"" which is a bold statement to make immediately after the release of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, but true regardless — at least for now. New data, though, reveals some even more impressive statistics about EA's new shooter.
According to this thread from senior director Mat Piscatella of the market research firm Circana, Battlefield 6 isn't just the best-selling shooter of the year, but is also the best-selling game of 2025 as well. It holds the top spot on both Xbox and Windows PC, and on PS5, it's in second place, with only NBA 2K26 achieving better sales performance.
Perhaps even more outstanding, though, is the fact that Battlefield 6 has had the strongest launch month of any game released in the past three years. The last title that sold more copies in a one-month timeframe after release is 2022's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 — a game that Battlefield 6's launch sales have been frequently compared to.
Circana's data also confirmed that Battlefield 6 is the best-selling game in Battlefield history. Previously, that title was held by 2016's Battlefield 1, which had a hugely successful launch week and sold over 5 million copies in that time frame. The latest title's performance surpassed even that, however.
 



Some of the other big games Battlefield 6 outsold in October include Pokémon Legends: Z-A, Ghost of Yotei, NBA 2K26, The Outer Worlds 2, and Little Nightmares 3, among others. Notably, recorded sales include both physical and digital copies across Xbox, PC, PlayStation, and the Nintendo eShop for the Nintendo Switch 2.
As for the top-selling games of 2025 it's outperformed, there's Monster Hunter: Wilds, Borderlands 4, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, Elden Ring Nightreign, and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 on that list, along with some fan-favorite 2024 holdouts like Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Helldivers 2.
All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.
It will be interesting to see Circana's November report and where Battlefield 6's current direct multiplayer shooter competitors — Black Ops 7 and ARC Raiders, namely — stand, as I can see one or both games eventually catching up to and surpassing it. But I'd say there's a good chance Battlefield will hold onto its best-sales crown, as well.
Battlefield 6's success can largely be attributed to its excellent gunplay and its position as a return to form for a series that's been struggling to remain relevant for years.
Battlefield 6's success can largely be attributed to its excellent gunplay and its position as a return to form for a series that's been struggling to remain relevant since 2018's Battlefield V, with 2021's Battlefield 2042 proving to be especially damaging to the franchise's reputation with its wild diversion from Battlefield's formula.
In contrast, Battlefield 6 brings back the series' class-based structure, complete with a huge variety of weapons, creative new class gadgets that provide a tactical edge when used intelligently, the most advanced and dynamic map destruction the franchise has ever had, 11 maps, and several different game modes to play. There's also a decent campaign, as well.
 



Towards the end of October, Battlefield Studios also released a free-to-play battle royale called Battlefield REDSEC for the game that directly competes with Call of Duty: Warzone. Though REDSEC hasn't contributed to any sales numbers, it's nevertheless brought a lot of attention to Battlefield 6, and many have likely purchased the full game after getting a taste of it through the battle royale.
If you don't yet own Battlefield 6 but are interested in playing it, note that there's a free trial coming next week that runs from November 25 to December 2. While it's active, you can play three of the game's maps across five of its game modes, and presumably, any progress you make towards unlocking weapons, attachments, and gadgets will carry over if you decide to buy the game.
Though REDSEC hasn't contributed to any sales numbers, it's nevertheless brought a lot of attention to Battlefield 6, and many have likely purchased the full game after getting a taste of it through the battle royale.
The free trial is being offered to celebrate the launch of Battlefield 6's California Resistance update — a new patch delivered as part of Season 1 that included the Eastwood map set in a SoCal golf resort, two new weapons, the addition of powerful ""battle pickup"" weapons like a minigun and a railgun you can find scattered throughout maps, plenty of new cosmetics, and more.
Battlefield 6 itself is available across Xbox Series X|S, Windows PC, and PS5 for $69.99. Note that the Xbox version is going for only $60.69 at Loaded; that's close to a full $10 off, and a great deal you should take advantage of if getting the game interests you.
The latest entry in the legendary Battlefield series is fantastic, and has brought the franchise back into a positive spotlight after the disappointment of Battlefield 2042. The game is available now across all its platforms, with Loaded (formerly CDKeys) offering some noteworthy discounts.Also for: PC | PS5Phantom Edition: $83.19 at Loaded (Xbox)

Breakups can feel sudden. But oftentimes the signs were always there.
That appears to be the case with the Marriott-Sonder split. The short-term rental's blowup with the hotel giant, followed by its bankruptcy, was particularly shocking for its customers.
Lawsuits, sloppy accounting, and a slew of executive departures and failed bailouts indicate issues were bubbling long before last week's dramatic divorce, writes BI's Madeline Berg, Natalie Musumeci, and Kelsey Vlamis.
That's not much solace for those who got caught in the crossfire.
By now, you've likely seen some of the stories: a single mom's dream vacation ruined, a post-proposal celebration cut short, a visit to a newborn granddaughter thrown into chaos.
Interestingly, insiders positioned the Marriott deal in August 2024 as a lifeline. But the startup also said it limited the young company.
On the one hand, people familiar with Sonder's finances told BI the Marriott deal, and the initial money that came from it, kept the company afloat.
But teaming up also resulted in massive headaches integrating Sonder's tech stack with Marriott's, Sonder said.
The Marriott-Sonder partnership is another gravestone in the cemetery of David-and-Goliath teamups.
They can come in different shapes and sizes (outright acquisitions, strategic investments, branded partnerships), but their approach is typically the same: pair a scrappy, nimble startup with a powerful established brand. The idea is to achieve the best of both worlds.
That's a lot easier said than done.
Sometimes, the two sides can't find enough common ground to make it work (Ford-Rivian). Other times, the startup isn't what it originally portrayed itself to be (JPMorgan-Frank).
Even with all the potential downsides, though, these types of deals won't go away. While the IPO window has slightly cracked open, many startups are still electing to stay private for longer than they used to. (It's worth noting Sonder went public and still faced these issues as its stock flatlined.)
And funding is proving difficult for any company that doesn't feature ""AI"" prominently in its pitch.
That means the majority of startups' best option for an exit will be with a bigger player.
And while that's a risk for both sides — as evident by the Marriott-Sonder debacle — it's one they might have to continue to take.

Gap is taking a victory lap after the success of its viral denim ad campaign over the summer.
Richard Dickson, CEO of Gap Inc., said the brand's ""Better in Denim"" ad campaign, in addition to being a huge hit on social media, converted into significant sales.
""With more than 8 billion impressions and 500 million views, Better in Denim culminated in a global cultural takeover and has become one of the brand's most successful campaigns to date, generating significant traffic and double-digit growth in denim,"" Dickson said Thursday on the company's third-quarter earnings call.
Gap Inc., which includes its namesake brand as well as titles like Old Navy and Banana Republic, beat analyst expectations and raised its guidance for the year. The stock price rose 5% in after-hours trading.
Gap's ""Better in Denim"" campaign, which came out over the summer, featured the girl group Katseye dancing to ""Milkshake"" by Kelis and was an instant hit. The ad was also notable as it came during a denim ad war of sorts, with several brands releasing their own headline-making campaigns, including American Eagle and Lucky Brand.
Dickson said Gap's campaign especially helped attract Gen Z consumers, who he described as ""highly engaged.""
""Influencer content is among the most common product discovery methods amongst Gen Z and millennials, which we've been performing incredibly well with,"" he said.
He also said ""collaborations are continuing to drive relevance and revenue,"" noting a recent collaboration with Sandy Liang that also drove younger consumers to Gap.
In addition to bridging the gap between generations, he said Gap was also attracting more high-income consumers with a strong competitive position ""between premium and value.""
Gap Inc.'s comparable sales grew by 5% compared to the year prior, the company said. For the Gap brand specifically, comparable sales were up 7% from the previous year, Katrina O'Connell, CFO of Gap Inc., said on the call.
Dickson said the company's solid performance for the quarter was fueled by ""broad-based strength in denim,"" crediting the Katseye campaign several times during the call.
""It was the denim story everybody wanted to be part of,"" he said, adding, ""This was a true cultural takeover. And I think it's another proof point in our playbook.""

Don't bet against Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison — especially if he has President Donald Trump on his side.
Paramount made a bid for all of Warner Bros. Discovery in time for the media conglomerate's self-imposed Thursday deadline, according to The New York Times. Comcast and Netflix are also bidding for the streaming and studios side of WBD, The Times reported.
Spokespeople for Paramount and WBD declined to comment. Spokespeople for Comcast and Netflix didn't respond to requests for comment.
A Paramount-WBD deal would be the largest media tie-up since Disney bought Fox's TV and movie studio in 2019. While mega-mergers of that magnitude are rare, legal experts say that Ellison's apparent rapport with Trump may help Paramount get around antitrust concerns.
""If we were talking about this a year ago, there's no way,"" said Corey Martin, an entertainment lawyer at Granderson Des Rochers in Los Angeles. ""But we're not under a Biden administration.""
Trump said in June that the then-incoming Paramount CEO was ""great"" and would ""do a great job"" at the media company. More recently, Ellison was invited to a White House dinner for Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, on Tuesday night. Ellison's father, the billionaire Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, has been a closer supporter of Trump for years.
David Ellison has said he doesn't want to ""politicize our company in any way, shape, or form."" Despite this stance, his move to appoint the anti-woke media entrepreneur Bari Weiss as the top editor at Paramount's CBS News made waves in the worlds of politics and media.
Paramount is the most logical bidder for WBD because it has the clearest path on the financing and regulatory fronts, and is the most motivated to make a deal, Raymond James media analyst Ric Prentiss wrote in a mid-November note.
WBD put a for-sale sign on itself in late October, after CEO David Zaslav said it had received ""unsolicited interest"" from multiple suitors. It appears Paramount, Comcast, and Netflix are most interested, though only Paramount seems to have the appetite to swallow all of WBD, which is separating its studio and streamer from its cable networks.
Rival Comcast is spinning off most of its cable TV assets, so adding more networks from WBD wouldn't make sense. Its stagnant stock price and high debt load may also limit how much it's able to bid without an equity partner, Raymond James' Prentiss wrote.
Another negative factor: Trump has expressed disdain for Comcast CEO Brian Roberts, as well as for MSNBC (which Comcast is spinning off) and NBC News.
The fit between Comcast and WBD ""on paper, is nearly perfect,"" media analyst Craig Moffett wrote in a mid-November note. But the MoffettNathanson cofounder also said ""the regulatory/political impediments to an acquisition could prove to be insurmountable.""
And while Netflix has the financial firepower to compete with Paramount in a bid, it has no interest or need for legacy TV networks. Co-CEO Ted Sarandos said the company is ""choosy"" about dealmaking on its latest earnings call.
Netflix ""is merely doing its due diligence"" on WBD and ""would not pay a premium to the current price in a competitive bidding process,"" MoffettNathanson's Robert Fishman wrote last week.
Plus, the streaming giant could run into regulatory roadblocks, either in the US or abroad.
Morgan Stanley's Ben Swinburne said in a Wednesday note that Netflix had the ""smallest synergy opportunity,"" meaning cost savings from a WBD deal, ""and perhaps the toughest regulatory path.""
Wall Street's excitement isn't shared by Hollywood creatives and some Paramount employees.
A Paramount marketing strategy staffer expressed concern that a merger would lead to more layoffs, although they said they had grown accustomed to cuts.
""Everyone at Paramount is used to it, in a sinister kind of way,"" this person said of layoffs. Ellison's company laid off 1,000 staffers in late October, and a person familiar with Paramount's plans told Business Insider that about 1,000 more cuts are coming, though the timeline on that is unclear.
Industry analysts say a merger of Paramount and Warner Bros. would be challenging to get through in a normal regulatory environment, as a consolidated studio could potentially pay creatives less while raising prices.
Antitrust regulators typically focus on how a merger of two powerful companies could impact the labor market and their pricing power over consumers. However, Martin, the entertainment lawyer, said much of that conventional analysis ""is out the window"" in the second Trump administration, in which personal relationships play a larger role.
Trump's apparent goodwill toward Paramount and Ellison, along with his administration's M&A-friendly stance, has legal experts feeling rosy about the chances of Paramount's WBD bid.
""There's room for some optimism by the companies that they would be able to consummate this merger if they wanted to,"" said Ray Seilie, an entertainment litigator at Los-Angeles-based law firm Kinsella Holley Iser Kump Steinsapir.
If WBD splits itself next summer, the two companies couldn't get acquired for two years without incurring significant tax penalties. That could delay any bidding process until 2028, when it's unclear who will control Congress and have the inside track to the White House.
In other words, Paramount Skydance might be thinking it's ""now or never"" to get a deal done for the WBD assets, Seilie said.
While Hollywood may complain about one firm controlling the Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros. studios, Ellison's plea to the Trump administration may be simple, legal experts said: buying WBD is the only way to survive when competing against deep-pocketed tech giants in a cutthroat industry.
""It's possible that the way things are right now are unsustainable, and they need this merger in order to effectively compete against Netflix,"" Seilie said.
Pairing Paramount+ with HBO Max and Warner Bros. could make Paramount a streaming superpower.
By bidding on WBD, Ellison can ""take advantage of a much larger opportunity to redefine Paramount's future,"" MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman wrote.

39,2025-11-21,"
            House Speaker Mike Johnson may want to put the Jeffrey Epstein saga behind him, but some Republicans saw rank-and-file members’ success in forcing Tuesday’s vote as an opportunity to push their own legislative priorities to the floor — even if it doesn’t have leadership’s blessing.
    

            GOP Rep. Anna Paulina Luna has put House Republican leaders on notice that unless they change their approach to a bipartisan bill banning lawmaker stock trading, she will circumvent them using a discharge petition and force a vote herself.
    

            In a recent interview in her office, the Florida Republican told CNN the overwhelming support from lawmakers to release the Jeffrey Epstein files should encourage more members to take advantage of the leadership-bucking tool that made the vote possible.
    

            “I think more members need to use it,” Luna said. “More members need to get outside of this mentality that you have to go and ask for permission from leadership to bring legislation. That’s not why you’re here. And that defeats the purpose of why you call yourself a representative. If you want to be a follower, call yourself a follower of Congress, but not a representative of Congress if you’re not doing your job.”
    

            Typically, the majority party’s leadership team dictates floor activity, setting the calendar for which bills are brought and when.
    

            Discharge petitions face many procedural hurdles (to start, it requires 218 signatures — a majority of all 435 members, rather than a majority of members present) and rarely lead to an actual vote.
    

            It’s even more unusual for a member to deploy the tactic when their own party is in power. But in a fractured Washington with razor-thin margins in the House, there are signs lawmakers may consider the strategy more seriously.
    

            GOP Rep. Don Bacon recently signed onto a discharge petition to restore collective bargaining rights for federal workers after President Donald Trump signed an executive order ending the practice. That petition just clinched the necessary 218 signatures needed to move forward toward a vote on the House floor. And this week, Bacon told CNN he is preparing to help launch another petition that would push for more aid to Ukraine.
    

            “I respect the speaker and the majority leader drive the agenda. But the discharge petition process enables us to push member-driven initiatives to the floor for a vote,” Bacon said.
    

            GOP Rep. Mike Lawler, who also signed onto the workers’ rights petition, said “it’s is certainly being viewed by members individuals as a tool in their disposal.” Still, he said, their use is “still very limited and it really depends on the issue.”
    

            This year alone, lawmakers have brought 10 discharge petitions, with the Epstein files push standing as the most notable. Last Congress, under Republican control, 20 discharge petitions were filed, after 18 the Congress before. By contrast in the 116th Congress, from 2019-2020, only 5 such attempts were made. Only a handful became law.
    

            Johnson had long tried to block the Epstein discharge petition from coming to the floor and strongly criticized the use of the tool to force a vote, even though he ultimately supported the measure.
    

            “Discharge petitions are never a good idea. In the House, it is a tool of the minority party, not the majority,” Johnson said in July.
    

            ﻿Acknowledging Johnson’s argument, Luna said, “A discharge petition is simply a legislative tool where we actually can collect signatures to bring something to the floor. It’s kind of an old school way of legislating.”
    

            And the tool has helped her clinch legislative wins. The congresswoman’s threat of bringing a discharge petition helped her reach an agreement with Johnson in their standoff over proxy voting for new parents, an issue that had paralyzed the House.
    

            “I will protect the discharge petition with every bone in my body,” Luna told CNN.
    

            Now, Luna is prepared to use the same strategy to ensure the bipartisan push to ban stock trading of lawmakers, their spouses and their dependent children becomes law as pressure has escalated for elected officials to weed out corruption and restore public trust in Congress.
    

            Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have long-traded stocks and seeking a ban has been a yearslong pursuit. But Luna says that she is running into new roadblocks that are clouding the process.
    

            Instead of taking up the bipartisan bill that has 95 cosponsors, Luna said she has been informed that leadership wants to pursue their own bill and that members would not be allowed to add their own amendments.
    

            “I’m just not feeling that this has been an open and honest process,” Luna said. “And so, I will make that decision collectivity with the other members who signed on.”
    

            CNN has reached out to Johnson’s office for comment.
    

            Luna said that House Speaker Mike Johnson has been understanding throughout this process, but she is giving leadership until Friday to address the issue with her.
    

            “At the end of the day, I understand that he also has to manage other people and there’s a lot of personalities,” Luna said of Johnson. “This is not a popular topic on the Hill. In fact, it’s made me very unpopular within the House of Representatives but very popular among the American people.”
    

            Even with the Friday deadline, Luna says her discharge petition is ready to go.
    

            “It’s filed, so it means it’s baked, so I can call it up whenever. And that’s the element of surprise that we like to keep people on our toes. So it’s ready to go,” she said.

41,2025-11-21,"Microsoft's handheld offerings are in a really embarrassing position right now. For third-party handhelds+, people are scrapping Windows 11 in favor of other operating systems, such as Steam and Bazzite, citing a better experience and in-game performance. For official Microsoft-branded handhelds...    people still find that Linux does it better. Yes, Microsoft can't seem to catch a break, even on its home turf.    
As such, Microsoft really needed an out before it ended up losing to SteamOS by default. Its answer was the Full Screen Experience (FSE), which turns Windows 11 into a dedicated gaming system, including redirecting all focus to everything needed for a smooth experience. And while FSE was only an Asus ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X thing to start, it's now arriving on all Windows 11 handhelds tomorrow.
It's getting too late for Microsoft to fight back
Microsoft announced the rollout for FSE over on the Xbox Wire. You'd be forgiven for not seeing the comments about FSE, as they're tucked away within a huge blog post detailing everything that Microsoft's gaming partners are doing. However, I promise you, if you take a close look at the intro, you will find the following paragraph:
Additionally, we also announced that full screen experience—originally available on the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X—is generally available tomorrow (November 21) across all gaming handhelds currently in market. Plus, we’re expanding FSE to more Windows 11 PC form factors through the Xbox and Windows Insider programs soon.
It's a smart move for Microsoft to get FSE out the door as soon as possible. With all the evidence mounting that using a Linux-based operating system like SteamOS or Bazzite is the better choice for any Windows 11 handheld, the company really needs to move fast. It doesn't want a repeat of its Internet Explorer/Edge reputation, where people would use it purely to download Chrome or Firefox.
So, will FSE save Windows 11 handhelds from SteamOS? Maybe not yet, but it's a good first step. We've toyed around with FSE ourselves at XDA HQ, both on a handheld and on a PC, and we were pretty impressed by what we saw. However, we had the same criticism for both; while using FSE to boot games was a ton more convenient, it didn't do a ton in the performance department. Ensuring games run as smoothly and quickly as possible should be Microsoft's number one concern as it fights to prevent people from treating its operating system like bloatware.

Welp, sorry Microsoft. I've spent the last 3 or 4 years moving everything in my household to Linux. I ain't turning back now, that ship has sailed. Too little, too late. In any case I bet it still doesn't run as good as Steam OS. "
42,2025-11-21,"The first time I visited Boerne, Texas, was to see my boyfriend's parents. It was Christmastime, and the picturesque Main Street was aglow with lights — even Santa Claus made an appearance.
Now, I visit the charming city just 30 minutes north of San Antonio several times a year to visit my now-husband's family, and it never loses its charm.
In fact, I've grown to love it even more — not just for all the good coffee shops, restaurants, and fun city events, but also for the people who live there.
Here's everything I love about Boerne, and why I think you should consider a visit the next time you find yourself in the ""Lone Star State.""
In my opinion, one of Boerne's best features is its Main Street. Known as the ""Hill Country Mile,"" Boerne's charming downtown is lined with boutiques, restaurants, bakeries, galleries, and specialty stores.
On most days, I've found plenty of community events taking place on Main Street.
Last month, I attended the city's annual ""Hill Country Mile Rod Run,"" where downtown is packed with beautiful classic cars and a vendor market offers local handmade goodies.
I think the shopping scene in Boerne is unmatched in unique finds, from clothing and jewelry to home decor and antiques.
As an avid reader, The Boerne Bookshop is one of my favorite places to visit, as the small store features a surprisingly large selection.
For antiques, you can't go wrong with visiting the Johns Road Antique Mall, which is a warehouse-sized shop with thousands of treasures.
And after enjoying brunch at The Dienger Trading Co. on Main Street, I like to walk inside the connected boutique for an assortment of clothing, accessories, and gifts for people of all ages.
On Saturdays, I also recommend stopping by the Cibolo Farmers Market at Herff Farms for a selection of handcrafted goods and plants. In my experience, the locals are always friendly and happy to share samples and stories about their products.
As I alluded to earlier, I think Boerne is full of amazing food and drinks.
For a great brunch, I suggest ordering a stack of pancakes at Sunny's, a new all-day brunch spot downtown.
Fans of Star Wars and science fiction must stop by Darkside Brick Oven Pizza Co.: Part delicious pizza restaurant, part pop culture museum. Just make sure to order the garlic knots, which were out of this world (pun fully intended).
I also recommend stopping by The Dodging Duck, a local favorite craft brewery and restaurant with a patio overlooking the duck pond across the street.
There are lots of excellent places in Boerne to grab a coffee and a pastry, including Bear Moon Bakery, The Daily Grind, and Bakery Lorraine.
But my favorite is Richter Bakhaus, a bakery known for its Texas-sized cinnamon rolls (literally the size of my face). 
I also love Boerne's natural beauty. Located in the Texas Hill Country, the city is situated among breathtaking landscapes and features miles of scenic trails.
Cibolo Nature Center has more than six miles of trails and is one of my family's favorite spots, thanks to its peaceful, slow-moving creek lined with tall cypress trees.
I think River Road Park is another great spot for watching ducks, taking a walk, or enjoying lunch at one of its many picnic tables.
Complete with a gazebo, bakeries, and novelty shops, I think visiting Boerne feels like walking onto the set of a Hallmark movie — and during Christmastime, that feeling is at its peak.
The festivities kick off on Thanksgiving weekend with ""Dickens on Main,"" an annual community celebration featuring live performances, shopping, food, and a Christmas tree lighting ceremony.
In addition to other holiday-themed events and a pop-up ice rink in the city's center, you can also find The Christmas Shoppe on Main Street, which sells seasonal decor all year round, but is admittedly extra magical during this time of year.
After years of visiting, Boerne has become one of my favorite places in Texas. Between its thriving Main Street, friendly locals, and Hill Country scenery, I think it's one of the best weekend getaways in the state.

It may not feel like it, but 2025 has been a record year for retail traders. It's been even busier than 2021, when GameStop mania was at its peak.
Compared to last year, retail activity is up 50%. That's likely indicative of more volatility in 2025, especially the nearly 20% drawdown from February to early April. Those shifting sands gave rise to investment strategies that have defined the year since.
So what are the trends that have dominated the year? The equity-strategy team at JPMorgan that focuses on retail investors has narrowed it down to three main ones:
1. A dip-buying bonanza
The firm says there were three major dip-buying events for day traders this year:
Since these were all concentrated in the first four months of 2025, about 75% of current stock-market positioning occurred during that period, with Nvidia and Tesla the biggest beneficiaries, JPMorgan found.
Retail investors have been less ardent about dip-buying in the weeks since, opting to largely stay on the sidelines during weakness two weeks ago. JPMorgan also noted that day traders have been net sellers this week as valuation concerns have flared.
2. ETFs are dominating
They've made up 75% of retail-trader inflows in 2025 so far. The chart below shows that, after the February-to-April volatility subsided, single-stock buying slowed down in favor of ETFs and options.
This contrasts with the meme-stock era, which saw a larger portion of purchases in single stocks.
JPMorgan points out that one fund in particular that's attracted immense retail-investor interest in 2025 has been the SPDR Gold Shares ETF. Interest in that coincided with a more-than-60% surge in the price of the metal, through an October year-to-date high.
3. Purchases of the 30 top AI stocks are coming at the expense of the broader market
JPMorgan calls the rest of the universe the ""SPX 470,"" which they say retail traders have been selling in order to finance purchases of AI stocks. That's played a role in the record concentration we've seen in mega-cap tech names.
It remains to be seen whether these dynamics will flip on signs the AI trade is reaching a point of exhaustion. It's a test we could see play out soon, with valuation concerns flaring again, even after an unabashedly strong Nvidia earnings report.

AIAssassin's Creed IV: Black FlagUbisoft 
There were always three big possibilities for why Ubisoft had cryptically delayed its latest earnings report just minutes after it was already supposed to go live. The first was a big injection of new cash, say from a sovereign wealth fund like Saudi Arabia’s. The second was an outright sale of a major portion of the company, maybe to its current backstop investor Tencent. The third was much more mundane: an accounting error. After a week of speculation, the Assassin’s Creed publisher confirmed that was indeed the reason for the delay.
Ubisoft explained on its conference call before markets opened in France this morning that the accounting issue had to do with new auditors brought in earlier this year to review the company’s books. They determined money from various business partnerships (one last year and one this year) needed to be recognized differently in the company’s accounting. As Reuters reports (via Game File), this mattered because the new math put the publisher in breach of its “leverage covenant ratio” for various loans, i.e. too much debt and not enough money coming in.
In its earnings press release, the company says it will use the recent $1.35 billion bailout from Tencent to pay off some of this debt and get more generous financing terms in order to “support its strategic ambitions, in line with the broader transformation currently underway.” Ubisoft doesn’t say what the business deals that led to the accounting snafu were for, but does claim that it out-performed estimates last quarter in part due to “stronger-than-expected partnerships.” It could be anything from TV and licensing deals to Game Pass revenue (Microsoft paid to add a bunch of the company’s old games to the service for its recent price hike). TL;DR: Ubisoft didn’t get sold, at least not yet.
Reports of the Rabbids‘ maker’s demise would seem greatly exaggerated. Ubisoft won’t provide actual sales figures for this year’s Assassin’s Creed Shadows but said the release was “overperforming.” It also pointed to Rainbow Six Siege, The Division 2, and a bunch of older games for why it beat revenue estimates by over $50 million, with bookings up 39 percent year-on-year.
Ubisoft has always been the Moneyball of the video game publishing world. It has no single mega hit like EA Sports FC or Call of Duty that can print mountains of cash on demand every year, but it does try to recreate those effects in the aggregate with a sprawling library of massive gamesâFar Cry 6, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, over a dozen Assassin’s Creed games in almost as many yearsâthat regularly go on sale for up to 90 percent off.
Ubisoft also teased its upcoming slate of releases which include the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake, Rainbow Six Mobile, The Division Resurgence, and an “unannounced title” coming out before April 2026. Insider Gaming reports the mystery release is the Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag remake we first reported on back in 2023. It will reportedly included some overhauled game systems and more of the open-world RPG feel of recent entries in the franchise. The company is probably looking at the recent monster success of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered and hoping for even a fraction of the same nostalgic hype.
But all of this is only filling a hole left by the fact that Ubisoft still can’t seem to get some of its biggest sequels out the door. That includes Far Cry 7, the new Ghost Recon, and the more-than-a-decade-in-the-making Beyond Good & Evil 2. Solving this development pipeline issue is seemingly at the heart of an operational overhaul Ubisoft promises to announce early next year. Long a spider-web of interoperable co-development studios scattered all over the world, the company is pledging to concentrate decision making in franchise-based “creative houses” for “stronger creative vision, greater focus, efficiency, autonomy and accountability.” Is that real change, or just a line from ChatGPT that some intern at McKinsey consulting thought sounded good?
Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot wants investors to know he’s completely onboard with AI. Here’s what he said on today’s call per Game File:
We are making great strides in applying Gen AI to high-value use cases that bring tangible benefits to our players and teamsâ¦Itâs as big as a revolution for our industry as the shift to 3D. And we have everything to lead on this front.
He says the company is running full-tilt into the future of the controversial tech from two directions: “groundbreaking player-facing generative AI applications” like neo NPCs that fill bespoke game worlds with LLM chatbots and, on the development side, with teams “in our studios and offices embracing this new technology and constantly exploring new use cases in programming, art and overall game quality.â
There are also two ways to interpret these commitments. The first is that Ubisoft has traditionally lagged behind competitors in market-leading breakthroughs and doesn’t want to be once again playing catch-up if, say, AI-made and operated MMORPG slop-fests are the future. The other is that the company is still very vulnerable; its stock price, while better after today’s news, is still in the toilet, and it needs to stick to the shareholder-approved script, unlike certain companies whose CEOsÂ may have more of a license to speak their minds with a Grand Theft Auto 6-sized trump card sitting in their pocket.
Either way, the AI stuff could all still be a dead end. Remember Scalar? It’s Ubisoft’s ambitious, cloud-based development technology meant to make game engines function like the internet. It threatened fans with even more massive game maps filled with even more quest icons. It has yet to materialize into anything big outside of the company, and one of the major projects utilizing it within Ubisoft has been continually rebooted. Some of the big names espousing Scalar’s virtues years ago? No longer with the company.
We’ll see if Assassin’s ChatGPT ends up having the same half-life.

What this means: On a weekly basis, Realtor.com reports the year-over-year change in active inventory, new listings and median prices.  On a monthly basis, they report total inventory.  For October, Realtor.com reported active inventory was up 15.3% YoY, but still down 13.2% compared to the 2017 to 2019 same month levels. 
Here is their weekly report: Weekly Housing Trends: U.S. Market Update (Week Ending Nov. 15, 2025)• Active inventory climbed 12.6% year over year

The number of homes active on the market climbed 12.6% year-over-year, as the streak of annual gains stretched past two years in length. There were about 1.1 million homes for sale last week, marking the 29th week in a row over the million-listing threshold. Active inventory is growing due to both new listings hitting the market, but mostly listings taking longer to sell in this weak 2025 sales year.
  
• New listings—a measure of sellers putting homes up for sale—rose 1.7% year over year

New listings edged up on an annual basis, the second straight week of gains and a return to more typical levels after last week’s surge.  Mortgage rates held in the low 6.2s range last week the low-6% range, which may be enticing some homeowners to make a move.
  
• The median listing price fell 0.4% year-over-year

he median list price dropped compared to the same week one year ago. Adjusting for home size, price per square foot fell 1.0% year-over-year, dropping for the 11th consecutive week. Price per square foot grew steadily for almost two years, but the weak sales activity has finally caught up and shaken underlying home values despite stable prices.

				Why top firms paradoxically fire good workers			


			SHARE		
Why do the world’s most prestigious firms—such as McKinsey, Goldman Sachs and other elite consulting giants, investment banks, and law practices—hire the brightest talents, train them intensively, and then, after a few years, send many of them packing? A recent study in the American Economic Review concludes that so-called adverse selection is not a flaw but rather a sign that the system is working precisely as intended.
Two financial economists, from the University of Rochester and the University of Wisconsin–Madison respectively, created a model that explains how reputation, information, and retention interact in professions where skill is essential and performance is both visible and attributable to a specific person, particularly in fields such as law, consulting, fund asset management, auditing, and architecture. They argue that much of the professional services world operates through “intermediaries”—firms that both hire employees (also referred to as “agents” or “managers”) and market their expertise to clients—because clients can’t themselves easily judge a worker’s ability from the outset.
“Identifying skilled professionals is critical yet presents a major challenge for clients,” the researchers write. “Some of the firm’s employees are high-quality managers,” says coauthor Ron Kaniel, the Jay S. and Jeanne P. Benet Professor of Finance at the University’s Simon Business School, “but the firm is paying them less than their actual quality, because initially the employees don’t have a credible way of convincing the outside world that they are high-quality.”
At the start of an employee’s career, the firm has an advantage, Kaniel and his coauthor Dmitry Orlov contend, because the firm (“the mediator”) can assess an employee’s talent more accurately than outside clients can. During what the authors call “quiet periods,” the firm keeps those who perform adequately and pays them standard wages.
Over time, however, an employee’s public performance—measured by successful cases, profitable investments, or well-executed projects—reduces the firm’s informational advantage. As the informational gap shrinks, the firm needs to pay some employees more because clients are now able to observe an employee’s good performance and hence update their beliefs about the employee’s skills.
“At some point, the informational advantage becomes fairly small,” says Kaniel, “and the firm says, ‘Well, I will basically start to churn. I will let go of some employees, and by doing that, I can actually extract more from the remaining ones.’”
Ironically, to the client these churned—or strategically fired—employees look just as good as the ones whom the firm kept. Churning happens not because these employees have failed but because they may be just somewhat lower-skilled than their peers. Subsequently, churning heightens both the reputation of the firm and of the employees who remain.
Somewhat counterintuitively, the researchers show that churning can benefit both sides. Workers who stay on with an elite firm accept lower pay in the short run as the tradeoff for building a stronger reputation for themselves. When these workers eventually leave the elite firms, they can command higher fees directly from clients.
As a result of the churning, the informational gap between firm and client keeps shrinking because the client catches up to what the firm knows about its workers and which ones it values most. At first glance, the duo argues, the firm’s reduced informational advantage should now cause a further drop in profits. But here comes the strategic twist: The firm starts to underpay those better workers who kept their jobs, akin to making them pay for being “chosen.” Consequently, profits do not decline and may even increase.
“Firms now essentially can threaten the remaining employees: ‘Look, I can let you go, and everybody’s going to think that you’re the worst in the pool. If you want me not to let you go, you need to accept below market wages,’” says Kaniel.
The result is a paradoxical but stable equilibrium. Workers accept being underpaid temporarily because remaining at a top firm serves as a signal to the market about their elite status. It also helps explain why prestigious employers can attract ambitious newcomers despite grueling hours and relatively modest starting pay.
Meanwhile, those who are let go aren’t failures—rather, their exit is part of a system that signals who’s truly top-tier, the researchers argue. In fact, fired workers often find success on their own because potential clients interpret a person’s prior affiliation with a top firm as proof of the worker’s strong ability and qualifications.
In short, the “up-or-out” path of professional life may not just be a cultural phenomenon among top professional service firms but also an efficient response to how reputation is maintained and information flows. What looks like a ruthless system of constant turnover, the researchers argue, is in reality a finely tuned mechanism that helps the market discover and reward true talent.

If you want to succeed at one of Elon Musk's companies, you might try listening to Shaun Maguire.
As a partner at Sequoia Capital, Maguire has led investments in several of Musk's companies, including The Boring Company, xAI, and SpaceX. He said that three key traits help people excel at Musk's businesses on an episode of ""Relentless,"" which aired on November 17.
Anyone who works for Musk can volunteer to take on a task, said Maguire, who The Information has dubbed the ""Musk Whisperer."" Continuously raising your hand and delivering will help you move up.
""Being extremely competent and being willing to bet on your own competence, and always delivering,"" Maguire said on the podcast. ""And knowing your limit.""
It's OK, he said, to admit when you can't do something, or when someone else might be better for the task.
""The next thing is very, very quickly learning that you need to go five levels deep,"" Maguire said. ""You need to be able to handle five levels of questions or so in anything.""
Lastly, Maguire said that loyalty is crucial — but that doesn't mean ""blind loyalty."" Instead, he said it's about trusting the system and that Musk ""sees things other people don't see.""
Though Maguire said Musk as an individual is hugely impressive, he added that part of the billionaire's strength lies in ""Elon the collective."" He didn't name the group, but said it includes around 20 people who have worked for Musk for years and built tremendous trust.
""They can almost read his mind, and they know what he would want to have done in some situation,"" Maguire said of the group.
Beyond that inner circle, Maguire said Musk looks for certain traits in capital investors: being willing to work hard, not letting information slip, and being there through good and bad.
""Most investors are leaky,"" Maguire said. ""This is a very low bar, but just not leaking things.""
Musk is famous for his work ethic and warned Tesla engineers last year that they might have to sleep on the manufacturing line at the Texas factory.
In turn, Maguire said Musk is good at attracting investors through marquee events, like when Optimus robots took center stage at an event last year.
For all that sets him apart, Maguire said Musk has ""a lot in common"" with another tech leader: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. Maguire said that he bought Nvidia stock in 1999 as a 13-year-old, but ""underestimated"" Huang at first.
""He's really pushed his advantage in an incredible way, and he's been so aggressive,"" Maguire said. The podcast aired just one day before Nvidia reported blowout earnings.
Maguire came under fire earlier this year for comments he made calling New York City mayoral elect Zohran Mamdani an ""Islamist."" Musk was among those who came to Maguire's defense as other tech leaders criticized him.

50,2025-11-21,"Sometimes, workplace coffee runs reveal a lot more nonsense than the average assignment. The HR office serves up its own flavor of delusion this time, complaining loudly that all fifty-plus job applicants for an open position just aren't ""special"" enough. Never mind the mountain of experience required for an entry-level posting or the six-week wait for a rejection email. No unicorns, no progress, try again next cycle.
The list of demands reads like a dating profile with way too many filters: must have five years of experience, the ability to juggle flaming swords, and a sparkling personality ready to work for pocket lint. Real applicants don't get feedback. They get ghosted, left waiting on a decision that probably came and went in less time than it takes HR to refill their mug.

Image is representative only and does not depict the actual subjects of the story.
What gets the spotlight isn’t even mediocrity. It is the myth of the “special” candidate who will swoop in and somehow justify every convoluted hiring policy. Karen from HR is busy scrolling through resumes and discarding them after a handful of seconds, all in the pursuit of the next “rockstar” or “ninja” team member.
The job market is a playground for buzzwords and wishful thinking. It’s no wonder “special” feels like a skill worth listing alongside all the other overdone corporate nonsense. Anyone still waiting for a callback might as well start their own legend, after all, that’s more likely to get noticed than actual qualifications.

51,2025-11-21,"In the early 1950s, Grace Hopper coined the term “compiler” and built one of the first versions with her A-0 system1. The compilers that followed abstracted away machine code, letting programmers focus on higher-level logic instead of lower-level hardware details. Today, AI coding assistants2 are enabling a similar change, letting software engineers focus on higher-order work by generating code from natural language prompts3. Everyone from big tech to well-funded startups is competing to capture this shift. Yesterday Google announced Antigravity, their new AI coding assistant, and the day before, AWS announced the general availability of their AI coding tool, Kiro. Last week, Cursor, the standout startup in this space, raised $2.3B in their series-D round at a valuation of $29.3B.
Two lines in Cursor’s press release stood out to me. The first:
We’ve also crossed $1B in annualized revenue, counting millions of developers.
This disclosure means Anysphere Inc. (Cursor’s parent company) is the fastest company in history to reach $1B in annual recurring revenue (ARR). Yes, faster than OpenAI, and faster than Anthropic4.
Engineers are trying every new AI coding tool. As a result, the AI-coding tool market is growing exponentially (+5x in just over a year)5. But it’s still early. As I wrote in Why Some AI Wrappers Build Billion-dollar Businesses, companies spend several hundred billion dollars a year on software engineering, and AI has the potential to unlock productivity gains across that entire spend.
Software developers represent roughly 30% of the workforce at the world’s five largest market cap companies, all of which are technology firms as of October 2025. Development tools that boost productivity by even modest percentages unlock billions in value.
In my view, this nascent market is splitting based on three types of users.
On one end is Handcrafted Coding. These are engineers who actively decline to use LLMs, either because of skepticism about quality or insistence on full control of every code. They argue that accepting AI suggestions creates technical debt you cannot see until it breaks in production. This segment continues to decline as the quality of AI coding models improves. 
The opposite end is Vibe Coding. These are typically non-engineers, who use AI to build concepts and prototypes. They prompt the model hoping for an end-to-end solution, accept the output with minimal review, and trust that it works. The user describes what they want and lets the model figure out the implementation details of how to build it.
In the middle sits Architect + AI Coding. The engineer uses the AI/LLM as a pair programmer exploring system designs, analyzing data models, and reviewing API details. When the work is something entirely new or something that needs careful handling, the human programmer still codes those pieces by hand. But for boilerplate code, package installations, generic User Interface (UI) components, and any kind of code that is typically found on the internet, they assign it to the model6. The engineer stays in command of what is important to them and delegates what is not.
Based on the user types, I think, the AI coding market splits into two.
Hands-off: Non-engineers (product managers, designers, marketers, other internal employees) use these tools to vibe code early product concepts. They look to AI as the lead engineer to spin-up concepts/prototypes of apps, websites, and tools by simply prompting the AI to make something for them. Lovable, Vercel, Bolt, Figma Make, and Replit fit here7. Code from these users, as of now, are not typically pushed to prod.
Hands-on: Professional software engineers use these tools in their existing workflow to ship production code. They use AI as an assistant to write boilerplate code, refactor existing services, wire new features or UI screens, and triage bugs in codebases. Cursor, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Github Copilot, Cline, AWS Kiro play here. These products live where the work is done, and integrate into the engineer’s workflow. This is, at least as of now, the bigger market segment.

That brings me to the second thing in Cursor’s press release that stood out to me:
Our in-house models now generate more code than almost any other LLMs in the world.
While I am not convinced about that claim8, what I am convinced about is that Cursor is still growing despite its previous reliance on foundation models. From Why Some AI Wrappers Build Billion-dollar Businesses again: 
But Cursor and other such tools depend almost entirely on accessing Anthropic, OpenAI and Gemini models, until open-source open-weight and in-house models match or exceed frontier models in quality. Developer forums are filled with complaints about rate limits from paying subscribers. In my own projects, I exhausted my Claude credits in Cursor mid-project and despite preferring Cursor’s user interface and design, I migrated to Claude Code (and pay ten times more to avoid rate limits). The interface may be better, but model access proved decisive.
Cursor’s new in-house model Composer-2, which just launched last month, is a good example of how this model versus application competition is evolving. Cursor claims (without any external benchmarks, I must say) that Composer-2 is almost as good as frontier models but 4x faster. It’s still early to say how true that is. Open-source models have not yet come close to the top spots in SWE-bench verified or in private evals9.
To me, model quality is the most decisive factor in these AI coding wars. And in my view, that’s why Claude Code has already overtaken Cursor, and OpenAI’s Codex is close behind, despite both having launched a year or so later. 
Even though the newcomers Cursor, Claude Code, and OpenAI Codex are the talk of the (developer) town, incumbents such as Microsoft with Github Copilot, AWS with Kiro, and Google with Antigravity, can utilize their existing customer relationships, bundle their offerings with their existing suites, and/or provide their option as the default in their tech stack to compete. As an example, Cursor charges $20–$40 monthly per user for productive usage, while Google Antigravity launched free with generous limits for individual users. Github Copilot still leads this market, proving once again that enterprise bundling and distribution has structural advantages. This is the classic Microsoft Teams vs. Slack Dynamic10.
One way for startups to compete is by winning individual users who may use a coding tool with or without formal approval, and then be the tool’s advocate inside the organization. That organic interest and adoption eventually forces IT and security teams to officially review the tool and then eventually sanction its usage.
Yet, even as these newer tools capture developer mindshare, the underlying developer tools market is changing. Both the IDEs developers choose and the resources they we consult have changed dramatically. StackOverflow, once the default for programmers stuck on a programming issue, has seen its traffic and number of questions decline dramatically since ChatGPT’s launch, suggesting that AI is already replacing some traditional developer resources.
Just as compilers freed programmers from writing assembly code, AI tools are freeing software engineers from the grunt work of writing boilerplate and routine code, and letting them us focus on higher-order thinking. Eventually, one day, AI may get so good that it will generate applications on demand and create entire software ecosystems autonomously. Both hands-off and hands-on AI coding tools, as well as incumbents and newcomers, see themselves as the path to that fully autonomous software generation, even if they are taking different approaches. The ones who get there will be those who deliver the best model quality that ships code reliably, go deep enough to ship features that foundation models can’t care enough to replicate, and become sticky enough that users will not leave even when they can11.

Hopper’s A-0 system and her definition of the term compiler is different from what we consider a compiler today, but it established the foundational concept.
In the context of coding assistants, most products labeled as AI tools are powered by LLMs, and so I use AI and LLM interchangeably in this article despite the actual difference.

A better comparison might be at the product level rather than company level. In that case, ChatGPT and Claude both reached $1B faster than Cursor did.

I would argue that the vast majority of productive code is hidden behind company firewalls. Current foundation models are trained on publicly available data on the internet, and do not have access to proprietary codebases. We are yet to see breakthrough solutions where a company augments their confidential private data to generate production-ready code using current LLMs. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation has shown some promise, it has not yet delivered transformative results. Companies such as Glean are actively working on this problem.
Replit and Cognition probably appeal to both segments. To me, Replit leans hands-off with its rapid prototyping focus. Cognition’s agent-based approach, though hands-off, lets engineers still control the code directly, making it lean hands-on.
I was curious how Cursor knows how much code is generated by other LLMs outside Cursor? When I asked this on hackernews, swyx suggested that they “can pretty much triangulate across openrouter x feedback from the top 3 model labs to compare with internal usage and figure that out”. To me, triangulation makes sense for internal estimates. but for external publication, I’m surprised Cursor didn’t include “we estimate” or similar qualifying language. My understanding is that FTC policy requires substantiation before making definitive comparative claims (like more than, better than etc). All that to say, I’m not fully convinced about their claims.
SWE-bench is a benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) on real world software engineering tasks and issues collected from GitHub. Performance against public benchmarks can be gamed by the model builders. Currently after any new model launch, we see people using the model in the wild and forming a consensus around how the model performs which is a better indicator than these benchmarks.
Microsoft bundled Teams into Office 365 subscriptions at no extra cost, using its dominant enterprise distribution to surpass Slack’s paid standalone product within three years despite Slack’s earlier launch and product innovation.

“One way for startups to compete is by winning individual users who may use a coding tool without formal approval, and then be the tool’s advocate inside the organization.” Working at a smaller company I can definitely say this is true! We actually had our tech leadership ask devs to suggest different AI tools and then got trials / limited seats on those to go through a pilot phase.

The early Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals are already starting to roll out, so you can get your shopping done now and enjoy the rest of your holiday. There's no need to rush out and fight the crowds the day after Thanksgiving. One of those early deals is for Samsung's Galaxy Watch 7 Bluetooth model in the 40mm size. Normally $250, you can get your hands on it for just $130 right now on Amazon — a discount of $120 or nearly 50%. It's available for that price in a couple of colorways, too.
Right off the bat, you'll notice the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 lineup was designed to look a lot more like the Apple Watch than previous models. But even so, it still retains a rather unique design, especially with its silicone band and multi-color accents. While a watch needs to look good on your wrist, and make a statement, a smartwatch like the Galaxy Watch 7 also has to include some pretty intuitive software features. Samsung's setup won't leave you wanting there.
You get Galaxy AI with sleep tracking, fitness and health support, built-in heart rate tracking, and a unique feature that tells you your energy score each day. Of course, that's just the advanced alerts — you also can pair with your smartphone and get notifications, take calls, send easy suggested replies via text and much, much more. Ultimately, this is one of the better deals available for a smartwatch in a while, let alone one of Samsung's.
You can look up reviews online, sure, and they're helpful for understanding what's new and what kind of features and functionality smartwatches like the Galaxy Watch 7 have to offer. But another great way to understand its value is to look at user reviews — people that already own the watch and are using it on the daily.
Out of over 5,600 global reviews, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 has a 4.5 out of 5 star rating on Amazon, with 76% of those reviews at five stars and 12% at four stars. User comments praise the watch as being ""feature-packed,"" offering ""great value,"" and ""absolutely worth it."" Although, some question its durability and battery-life, noting it doesn't last as long as they expected. But with something like a smartwatch, battery life is also largely going to depend on how you're using it. Making frequent calls or answering messages often, using the advanced AI features, and having the screen on for longer periods are going to drain the battery life more quickly. Reddit users also mention the watch face you choose has a lot to do with battery life, but over time, as it learns your usage habits, battery life should improve.
If you want some quick comparisons in the Samsung Galaxy Watch lineup, the Galaxy Watch Ultra earned high marks from BGR's Christian de Looper with a nine out of ten rating. The slightly newer Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic earned an eight out of ten. When all is said and done, a discount of nearly half off and a final price of $130 makes this an intriguing deal."

The artificial intelligence revolution will be only three years old at the end of November. Think about that for a moment. In just 36 months AI has gone from great-new-toy, to global phenomenon, to where we are today – debating whether we are in one of the biggest technology bubbles or booms in modern times.
To us what’s happening is obvious. We both covered the internet bubble 25 years ago. We’ve been writing about – and in Om’s case investing in – technology since then. We can both say unequivocally that the conversations we are having now about the future of AI feel exactly like the conversations we had about the future of the internet in 1999. 
We’re not only in a bubble but one that is arguably the biggest technology mania any of us have ever witnessed. We’re even back reinventing time. Back in 1999 we talked about internet time, where every year in the new economy was like a dog year – equivalent to seven years in the old. 
Now VCs, investors and executives are talking about AI dog years – let’s just call them mouse years –  which is internet time divided by five? Or is it by 11? Or 12?   Sure, things move way faster than they did a generation ago. But by that math one year today now equals 35 years in 1995. Really? 
We’re also months, not years, from the end of the party. We may be even closer than that.  NVIDIA posted better than expected earnings on Wednesday. And it briefly looked like that would buoy all AI stocks. It didn’t. 
All but Alphabet have seen big share declines in the past month. Microsoft is down 12 percent, Amazon is down 14 percent, Meta is down 22 percent, Oracle is down 24 percent, and Corweave’s stock has been almost cut in half, down 47 percent. Investors are increasingly worried that everyone is overspending on AI.
All this means two things to us: 1)The AI revolution will indeed be one of the biggest technology shifts in history. It will spark a generation of innovations that we can’t yet even imagine. 2) It’s going to take way longer to see those changes than we think it’s going to take right now. 
Why? Because we humans are pretty good at predicting the impact of technology revolutions beyond seven to ten years. But we’re terrible at it inside that time period. We’re too prone to connect a handful of early data points, to assume that’s the permanent slope of that line and to therefore invest too much too soon. That’s what’s going on right now.
Not only does the AI bubble in 2025 feel like the internet bubble in 1999, the data suggests it may actually be larger. The latest estimates for just global AI capital expenditures plus global venture capital investments already exceed $600 billion for this year. And in September Gartner published estimates that suggested all AI-related spending worldwide in 2025 might top $1.5 trillion.  
I had ChatGPT (of course) find sources and crunch some numbers for the size of the internet bubble in 1999 and came up with about $360 billion in 2025 dollars, $185 billion in 1999 dollars.  
The spending is also happening in a fraction of the time. The internet bubble took 4.6 years to inflate before it burst. The AI bubble has inflated in two-thirds the time. If the AI bubble manages to actually last as long as the internet bubble – another 20 months – just spending on AI capital expenses by the big tech companies is projected to hit $750 billion annually by the end of 2027, 75 percent more than now. 
That means total AI spending for 2029 would be well over $1 trillion.  One of the things both of us have learned in our careers is that when numbers are so large they don’t make sense, they usually don’t make sense. 
Sure, there are important differences between the internet bubble and the AI bubble. History rhymes. It doesn’t repeat. A lot of the early money to build AI data centers and train LLMs has been coming out of the giant bank accounts of the big tech companies. The rest has been largely financed by private professional investors. 
During the internet bubble, public market investors, especially individuals, threw billions at tiny profitless companies betting they’d develop a business before the money ran out. And dozens of telecom startups borrowed hundreds of billions to string fiber optic cables across oceans and continents betting that exploding internet usage would justify that investment. 
Neither bet happened fast enough for investors and lenders. Most of the dot coms were liquidated. Most of the telecom companies declared bankruptcy and were sold for pennies on the dollar.
But does that make the AI bubble less scary than the internet bubble? Not to us. It actually might be scarier. The amounts at risk are greater, and the exposure is way more concentrated. Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, NVIDIA, Oracle and Apple together represent roughly a third of the value of the critical S&P 500 stock market index. More importantly, over the last six months the spending has become increasingly leveraged and nonsensical. 
None of these companies has proven yet that AI is a good enough business to justify all this spending. But the first four are now each spending $70 billion to $100 billion a year to fund data centers and other capital intensive AI expenses. Oracle is spending roughly $20 billion a year. 
If the demand curve shifts for any or all of these companies, and a few of them have to take, say a $25 billion write down on their data center investments, that’s an enormous amount of money even for these giants. 
And when you add in companies like OpenAI, AMD and CoreWeave plus the slew of other LLM and data center builders, their fortunes look incredibly intertwined. If investors get spooked about future returns from any one of those companies, the contagion could spread quickly. 
Yes, by one measure AI stocks aren’t over valued at all. Cisco’s P/E peaked at 200 during the internet bubble. NVIDIA’s P/E is about 45. The P/E of the NASDAQ-100 is about 35 now. It was 73 at the end of 1999. But looking at the S&P 500 tells a scarier story. Excluding the years around Covid-19, the last time the P/E ratio of that index was as high as it is now – about 24 – was right before the internet bubble popped in March 2000.   
Here are two other worrisome differences between then and now: 
1) The overall US economic, social and political situation is much more unstable than it was 25 years ago. Back then the US was still basking in the glow of having won the Cold War. It had the most dominant economy and stable political standing in the world. Today economic growth is slower, the national debt and government spending have never been higher, and the nation is more politically divided than it has been in two generations. 
2)The AI revolution is becoming a major national security issue. That ties valuations to the current unpredictability of US foreign policy and tariffs. China has become as formidable a competitor to the US in AI as the Soviet Union was to the US in the 1950s and 1960s. It doesn’t require much imagination to think about what might happen to the US AI market should China come up with a technical advance that had more staying power than the DeepSeek scare at the beginning of this year.
Even OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon, and just this week, Alphabet’s Sundar Pichai are now acknowledging they are seeing signs of business excess. Pichai said the following to the BBC on Tuesday: “Given the potential for this technology (AI), the excitement is very rational. It is also  true that when we go through these investment cycles there are moments where we overshoot …. We can look back at the internet right now. There was clearly a lot of excess investment. But none of us would question whether the internet was profound …. It fundamentally changed how we work as a society. I expect AI to be the same.” 
When will the mania end? There’s hundreds of billions of dollars of guaranteed but unspent capital in the system, which suggests it will go on well into 2026. But in times like these a secular investor sentiment change can happen in a matter of weeks, driving down stock prices, driving up the cost of capital, and making every financial model that had said “let’s invest” to one saying “not on your life.” 
A technology change with more staying power than DeepSeek would certainly do it. So would President Trump changing his mind about greasing the approval process for new AI data centers. All it would take would be an off hand remark from a Silicon Valley titan he didn’t like. 
Or what’s already happening with AI stocks could snowball. Investors have hammered those stocks because they’ve gotten jumpy about the size of their AI spending and in Oracle and Coreweave’s case, the leverage they are using to pay for it all. NVIDIA’s better than expected earnings announced Wednesday might ultimately calm things. But don’t expect any of these issues to go away. 
If you want to go further, what we’ve done is lay out the four big vulnerabilities we’re worried about with separate headings. And, of course, if you have an entirely different set of numbers that you think shows we’re nowhere near bubble territory, have suggestions about how to refine ours, or think we left something out, please share. 
To us the four big vulnerabilities are: 
Too much spending.  
Too much leverage.
Crazy deals. 
China. China. China. 
*****
Too much spending: 
We all know two things about the AI bubble right now: 1)People, companies and researchers will pay for AI. 2)They aren’t paying nearly enough to justify the hundreds of billions of dollars that has been committed to it yet.
The thinking, of course, is that that gap will quickly disappear and be replaced with enough paid usage to generate enormous profits. The questions that no one has the answer to are: When will that happen?  How much more money will it take? And which approach to making money will work the best? 
Will it work better just to charge for AI based on usage the way Microsoft, Oracle, Amazon, and OpenAI are focused on? Will it be more of an indirect revenue driver the way Meta is approaching it with its open source models? Will it have an advertising component the way Alphabet is exploring? 
Or will it be a do-everything, vertically integrated approach that works best? Amazon and Meta are exploring this. But Alphabet is the furthest ahead. It not only has its own AI software but is also using a lot of its own graphics processing chips known as Tensor Processing Units. This gives it much more control over processing costs than competitors who are – at least for the moment – entirely dependent on NVIDIA and AMD graphics processing chips. 
The only thing everyone agrees on is that the stakes are enormous: Digital technology revolutions historically have been winner-take-all-affairs whether in mainframes, minicomputers, personal computers, chips, software, search, or smartphones. That means there are likely to be only a couple of dominant AI providers five years from now. 
Maybe they’ll only be one, if one of them manages to truly get their system to reach artificial general intelligence. What it certainly means, however, is that, as in the past, there will be way more losers than winners, and there will be many big companies with giant holes in their balance sheets. 
OpenAI has become exhibit A in this spending frenzy partly because it’s the leading AI chatbot and helped ignite the AI revolution with ChaptGPT version 3 in November 2022.  
It’s also because, frankly, it’s hard to look away from the company’s financial highwire act. Its competitors have other businesses they can fall back on. OpenAI must make its bet on AI work, or it becomes one of the biggest meltdowns in the history of business. 
This is a company that hasn’t come close to making a profit or even being cash flow positive, but investors last valued it at $500 billion. That would rank it as the 21st most valuable company in the stock market, with BankAmerica. And at the end of October it made changes to its corporate structure that would allow it to have a traditional IPO in a year or two. There was speculation that that could value the company at $1 trillion. 
In the past three years OpenAI has raised more than $55 billion, according to published reports.  And while its revenues for 2025 seem to be on track to hit $12 billion, the company is burning through cash quickly.
Its cash burn this year is expected to top $8 billion and top $17 billion in 2026. It says it expects to spend nearly half a trillion dollars on server rentals over the next five years, and says it doesn’t expect to be generating more cash from operations than it is spending until 2029. That’s when it expects revenues to top $100 million. It agreed to pay nearly $7 billion for former Apple design chief Jonny Ive’s startup IO, in May. 
“Eventually we need to get to hundreds of billions of a year in revenue,” CEO Sam Altman said in response to a question about OpenAIs finances at the end of October. “I expect enterprise to be a huge revenue driver for us, but I think consumer really will be too. And it won’t just be this (ChatGPT) subscription, but we’ll have new products, devices and tons of other things. And this says nothing about what it would really mean to have AI discovering science and all of those revenue possibilities.” 
We’ve seen this movie before, of course. Whether we’re looking at the railroad construction bubble in the US 150 years ago or the internet bubble 25 years ago, investors touting the wisdom of “get big fast” have often been endemic to technology revolutions.
It’s what made Amazon the OpenAI of the internet bubble.  “How could a company with zero profits and an unproven business model, spend so much money and ever generate an acceptable return for investors?” we asked 
And most of the criticism about Amazon, the online retailer, actually turned out to be true. Yes, Amazon is now one of the most successful companies in the world. But that only happened because of something Amazon discovered ten years after its founding in 1994 – Amazon Web Services, its hugely profitable cloud computing business. 
Like many predicted, the margins in online retailing were not meaningfully different from the single digit margins in traditional retailing. That meant that Amazon wasn’t a profitable enough business to justify all that spending. If you had invested in Amazon at the peak of the internet bubble, you would have waited another decade before your investment would have started generating returns. 
And here’s the thing that makes eyes bulge: OpenAI’s  expected spend, just based on the money it’s raised so far, is set up to be 16 times what Amazon spent during its first five years even when adjusting that number into 2025 dollars. 
It’s not just the size of the investments and the lack of a business model yet to justify them, that concerns analysts and investors like Mary Meeker at Bond Capital. It’s that the prices that AI providers can charge are also falling. “For model providers this raises real questions about monetization and profits,” she said in a 350 page report on the future of AI at the end of May. “Training is expensive, serving is getting cheap, and pricing power is slipping. The business model is in flux. And there are new questions about the one-size-fits-all LLM approach, with smaller, cheaper models trained for custom use cases now emerging.
“Will providers try to build horizontal platforms? Will they dive into specialized applications? Will one or two leaders drive dominant user and usage share and related monetization, be it subscriptions (easily enabled by digital payment providers), digital services, ads, etc.? Only time will tell. In the short term, it’s hard to ignore that the economics of general-purpose LLMs look like commodity businesses with venture-scale burn.”

Too much leverage:
Bloomberg, Barron’s, The New York Times and the Financial Times have all published graphics in the past month to help investors visualize the slew of  hard to parse, seemingly circular, vendor financing deals involving the biggest players in AI. They make your head hurt. And that’s a big part of the problem.
What’s clear is that NVIDIA and OpenAI have begun acting like banks and VC investors to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars to keep the AI ecosystem lubricated. What’s unclear is who owes what to whom under what conditions.
NVIDIA wants to guarantee ample demand for its graphics processing units. So it has  participated in 52 different venture investment deals for AI companies in 2024 and had already done 50 deals by the end of September this year, according to data from PitchBook. That includes participating in six deals that raised more than $1 billion,   
It’s these big deals that have attracted particular attention.  NVIDIA is investing as much as $100 billion in OpenAI, another $2 billion in Elon Musk’s xAI, agreed to take a 7 percent stake in CoreWeave’s IPO and, because it rents access to NVIDIA chips, buy $6.3 billion in cloud service from them. The latest deal came earlier this week.  NVIDIA and Microsoft said that together they would invest up to $15 billion in Anthropic in exchange for Anthropic buying $30 billion in computiong capaicty from Microsoft running NVIDIA AI systems. 
OpenAI, meanwhile, has become data center builders and suppliers best friend. It needs to ensure it has unfettered access not only to GPUs, but data centers to run them. So it has committed to filling its data centers with NVIDIA and AMD chips, and inked a $300 billion deal with Oracle and a $22.4 billion deal with CoreWeave for cloud and data center construction and management. OpenAI received $350 million in CoreWeave equity ahead of its IPO in return. It also became AMDs largest shareholder. 
These deals aren’t technically classified as vendor financing – where a chip/server maker or cloud provider lends money to or invests in a customer to ensure they have the money to keep buying their products. But they sure look like them. 
Yes, vendor financing is as old as Silicon Valley.  But these deals add leverage to the system. If too many customers run into financial trouble, the impact on lenders and investors is exponentially severe. Not only do vendors experience cratering demand for future sales, they have to write down a slew of loans and/or investments on top of that. 
Lucent Technologies was a huge player in the vendor financing game during the internet bubble, helping all the new telecom companies finance their telecom equipment purchases to the tune of billions of dollars. But when those telecom companies failed, Lucent never recovered. 
The other problem with leverage is that once it starts, it’s like a drug. You see competitors borrowing money to build data centers and you feel pressure to do the same thing Oracle and Coreweave have already gone deeply in debt to keep up. Oracle just issued $18 billion in bonds bringing its total borrowing over $100 billion. It’s expected to ask investors for another $38 billion soon. Analysts expect it to double that borrowing in the next few years. 
And Coreweave, the former crypto miner turned data center service provider, unveiled in its IPO documents earlier this year that it has borrowed so much money that its debt payments represent 25 percent of its revenues. Shares of both these companies have taken a beating in the past few weeks as investors have grown increasingly worried about their debt load.  
The borrowing isn’t limited to those who have few other options. Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon have recently announced deals to borrow money, something each company historically has avoided. 
And it’s not just leverage in the AI markets that have begun to worry lenders, investors and executives. Leverage is building in the $2 trillion private credit market.  Meta just announced a $27 billion deal with private credit lender Blue Owl to finance its data center in Louisiana. It’s the largest private credit deal ever. By owning only 20 percent of the joint venture known as Hyperion, Meta gets most of the risk off its balance sheet, but maintains full access to the processing power of the data center when it’s complete.
Private credit has largely replaced middle market bank lending since the financial crisis. The new post crisis regulations banks needed to meet to make many of those loans proved too onerous. And since the world of finance abhors a vacuum, hedge funds and other big investors jumped in. 
Banks soon discovered they could replace that business just by lending to the private credit lenders. What makes these loans so attractive is exactly what makes them dangerous in booming markets: Private credit lenders don’t have the same capital requirements or transparency requirements that banks have.
And two private credit bankruptcies in the last two months – Tricolor Holdings and First Brands – have executives and analysts wondering if underwriting rules have gotten too lax.
“My antenna goes up when things like that happen,” JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon told investors. “And I probably shouldn’t say this, but when you see one cockroach, there are probably more. And so we should—everyone should be forewarned on this one….  I expect it to be a little bit worse than other people expect it to be, because we don’t know all the underwriting standards that all of these people did.”
*****
Crazy deals: 
Even if you weren’t even alive during the internet bubble, you’ve likely heard of Webvan if you pay any attention to business. Why? Because of all the questionable deals that emerged from that period, it seemed to be the craziest. The company bet it could be the first and only company to tackle grocery home delivery nationwide, and that it could offer customers delivery within a 30 minute window of their choosing. Logistics like this is one of the most difficult business operations to get right. Webvan’s management said the internet changed all those rules. And investors believed them. 
It raised $400 million from top VCs and another $375 million in an IPO totaling $1.5 billion in today’s dollars and a valuation in today’s dollars of nearly $10 billion. Five years after starting and a mere 18 months after its IPO, it was gone. Benchmark, Sequoia, Softbank, Goldman Sachs, Yahoo, and Etrade all signed up for this craziness and lost their shirts. 
Is Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines the next Webvan? It’s certainly too soon to answer that question. But it’s certainly not too soon to ask. Webvan took four years to raise $1.5 billion in 2025 dollars. Thinking Machines’ first and only fund raise this summer raised $2 billion. Ten top VCs piled in valuing the company at $10 billion. Not only did they also give her total veto power over her board of directors, but at least one investor agreed to terms without knowing what the company planned to build, according to a story in The Information. “It was the most absurd pitch meeting,” one investor who met with Murati said. “She was like, ‘So we’re doing an AI company with the best AI people, but we can’t answer any questions.’”
Yes, Murati is one of AIs pioneers, unlike Webvan CEO George Shaneen, who had no experience in logistics or online shopping. Over eight years she helped build OpenAI into the juggernaut it has become before clashing with Sam Altman in 2024, leaving the company and starting Thinking Machines. And yes, Thinking Machines has finally announced some of what it is working on. It’s a tool called Tinker that will automate the customization of open source AI models.  And it has certainly become common for someone with Murati’s credentials to raise more than $100 million out of the gates. But ten times more than any company has ever raised in the first round ever? 
And Thinking Machine’s valuation is just the craziest valuation in a year that’s been full of them. Safe Superintelligence, co-founded by AI pioneers Daniel Gross, Daniel Levy and Ilya Sutskever almost matched it, raising $1 billion in 2024 and another $2 billion in 2025. Four year old Anthropic raised money twice in 2025. The first in March for $3.5 billion valued it at $61.5 billion. The second  for $13 billion valued the company at $170 billion.  
As of July there were 498 AI “unicorns,” or private AI companies with valuations of $1 billion or more, according to CB Insights. More than 100 of them were founded only in the past two years. Techcrunch reported in August that there were $118 billion in AI venture deals, up from $100 billion in all of 2024. Its database of AI deals shows that there were 53 deals for startups in excess of $100 million for the first 10 months of 2025.

China, China, China: 
The race to compete with China for technical dominance over the future of artificial intelligence has become as much a fuel to the AI bubble as a risk. Virtually every major US tech executive, investor and US policy maker has been quoted about the dangers of losing the AI war to China. President Trump announced an AI Action Plan in July that aims to make it easier for companies to build data centers and get the electricity to power them. 
The worry list is long and real. Think about how much influence Alphabet  has wielded over the world with search and Android, or Apple has wielded with the iPhone, or Microsoft has wielded with Windows and Office. Now imagine Chinese companies in those kinds of dominant positions. Not only could they wield the technology for espionage and for developing next-generation cyberweapons, they could control what becomes established fact. 
Ask DeepSeek “Is Taiwan an independent nation?” and it replies “Taiwan is an inalienable part of China. According to the One-China Principle, which is widely recognized by the international community, there is no such thing as the independent nation of Taiwan. Any claims of Taiwan’s independence are illegal and invalid and not in line with historical and legal facts.” 
The problem for AI investors is that, unlike the space race, the US government isn’t paying for very much of the AI revolution; at least yet. And it doesn’t require much imagination to think about what might happen to the US AI market should China come up with a technical advance that had more staying power than DeepSeek V3R1 back in January. 
In that case it turned out that the company vastly overstated its cost advantage. But everyone connected to AI is working on this problem. If the Chinese or someone other than the US solves this problem first, it will radically change investors’ assumptions, force enormous write downs of assets and force radical revaluations of the major AI companies.
Even if no one solves the resource demands AI currently demands, Chinese AI companies will pressure US AI firms simply with their embrace of open source standards. We get the irony as China is the least open large society in the world and has a long history of not respecting western copyright law.
The Chinese power grid is newer and more robust too. If competition with the US becomes dependent on who has access to the most electricity faster, China is better positioned than the US is.
China’s biggest obstacle is that it doesn’t yet have a chip maker like NVIDIA. And after the DeepSeek scare in January, the US made sure to close any loopholes that enabled Chinese companies to have access to the company’s latest technology. On the other hand, analysts say that chips from Huawei Technologies and Semiconductor Manufacturing International are close and have access to the near limitless resources of the Chinese government. 
Who wins this race eventually? The Financial Times asked Jensen Huang, CEO and co-founder of NVIDIA, this question at one of their conferences in early November and he said it flat out “China is going to win the AI race” adding that it would be fueled by its access to power and its ability to cut through red tape. Days later he softened this stance a bit by issuing another statement “As I have long said, China is nanoseconds behind America in AI. It’s vital that America wins by racing ahead and winning developers worldwide.”

The PS5 launched in 2022 and maintained strict pricing for years, with Sony rarely offering any meaningful discounts even during major shopping events. This marks the first year the console sees genuine Black Friday price cuts, and these deals appear exclusively on Amazon. The PS5 Slim with disc drive drops to $449 from $549, while the Digital Edition hits $399 instead of $499. Both represent all-time low pricing for 2025Â and stock moves fast given the pent-up demand from years of limited availability and no discounts.
See PS5 Slim Standard at Amazon
See PS5 Slim Digital Edition at Amazon
The $449 disc drive version plays physical game discs and 4K Blu-ray movies and gives you flexibility in how you buy games: You can purchase used games, borrow from friends, sell titles you’ve finished, or take advantage of retail sales that often beat digital pricing. The physical media option preserves your ability to own games rather than licensing them digitally, which matters when publishers remove titles from digital stores. The 4K Blu-ray player adds value if you collect physical movies or want the best possible video quality without compression artifacts from streaming.
The $399 Digital Edition drops the disc drive altogether and saves you a cool $50 and making the console slightly lighter and more symmetrical in design. You download all games and content from the PlayStation Store, which means no disc swapping and instant access to your library. Digital purchases go on sale regularly through PlayStation Store promotions, and you can game share with one other person through console sharing settings. The trade-off is in losing resale value and being locked into whatever pricing Sony sets digitally.
Both versions pack the same internal hardware for identical gaming performance. A custom AMD GPU based on the RDNA 2 architecture handles ray tracing, 4K resolution at up to 120fps in supported games, and variable refresh rate for smoother visuals. An 8-core Zen 2 CPU will process game logic and AI calculations with plenty of headroom for demanding titles, while 16GB GDDR6 of unified memory ensures smooth performance without bottlenecks between CPU and GPU operations.
The bespoke 825GB SSD fundamentally changes how games load and operate. Load times often fall from minutes to mere seconds, while some games offer near-instant fast travel. For the first time, developers can stream assets in real time rather than rely on loading corridors or elevator rides to mask transfers of data on high-speed storage. This storage architecture is the single biggest generational leap the PS5 offers over PS4 and transforms how games feel to play.
The DualSense controller included offers haptic feedback which replaces the rumble feature of old with precise, intricate vibrations that simulate everything from textures to feelings. Adaptive triggers will create resistance that changes depending on what’s happening in-game, from the tension of drawing a bow to the recoil of different weapons. These features add immersion that previous controllers couldn’t achieve.
Backward compatibility with PS4 games means your existing library carries forward, with many titles receiving performance boosts on PS5 hardware. Games run at higher frame rates, load faster, and sometimes receive resolution upgrades without requiring separate purchases. The PS Plus collection includes access to a curated selection of PS4 classics at no additional cost beyond the subscription.
At $449 for the disc version and $399 for digital, these are the best PS5 pricing we have seen this year. The disc model saves you $100 while keeping physical media flexibility, while the digital edition drops down to impulse-purchase territory for anyone holding out. These Black Friday prices on Amazon finally get the PS5 into a place where it’s accessible without the markup or bundles that dominated availability for years.

When Robinhood launched its app in 2015 with a commission-free trading platform, it positioned itself as the anti-Wall Street offering for a generation skeptical of big banks and old-school brokers.
But in a recent interview on Jack Altman's ""Uncapped"" podcast, CEO Vlad Tenev said a surprising cultural reversal is now underway: Gen Z is embracing financial traditions their parents ignored, while older investors are chasing the new and shiny. 
""Now I think Gen Z and Gen Alpha, there's almost this opposite thing happening where the old big storied incumbents are kind of cool again,"" Tenev said. ""There's a broader trend of things that are old and kind of, you know, maybe that your grandparents would use, being cool again.""
He pointed to the resurgence of older technologies as examples of that shift.
""Gen Zs are really into buying vinyl, and cassette tapes are selling again,"" he said. ""My daughter asked me if she could have a Walkman.""
That same nostalgia, Tenev added, is showing up in Gen Z's personal finance.
""I think the same way, financially, people are like — the younger generation is interested in retirement,"" he said. ""Now Gen Zs are opening retirement accounts at 19 years old.""
For Tenev, that early financial seriousness reflects a new mindset. Gen Z wants control, stability, and legitimacy — values that once made Vanguard and Fidelity household names.
The irony, he said, is that older investors now crave what Robinhood offers: a sense of innovation and ease.
""You would think with older customers, we would emphasize how stable and how long we've been around and all these things, but actually that resonates very strongly with young people — and older people want to be that you can be plugged into the cool new thing. It's innovative, easy to use, we have all these features.""
That generational flip is forcing Robinhood to rethink how it presents itself.
The company built its brand on disruption — free trades, crypto, meme stocks — but it's now trying to appeal across age groups without getting ""stuck in a generation,"" as Tenev put it.
""E-Trade was very popular with Gen X — it became a Gen X broker,"" he said. ""Schwab's average customer is in their 60s or 70s now, so it's very much the broker of the boomer generation.""
Robinhood, he added, is trying to break that pattern.
""What we try very hard to do is always pay attention to the next generation while also moving up market in the sense of being able to serve older customers.""

Apple's voice assistant Siri gave it a considerable head start in the chatbot race. So why has Apple never had a ChatGPT-style breakthrough in the new AI era?
Babak Hodjat, one of the inventors of the backend natural language processing technology that led to the development of Siri, has a theory. He thinks Apple didn't capitalize on its early lead with the voice assistant because the company was too narrowly focused on its visual and audio appeal rather than the quality of users' interactions with it.
Apple seemed to focus on the ""look and feel of Siri"" over improving the underlying answers it gave, Hodjat told Business Insider in an interview at the Web Summit conference in Lisbon this month.
Apple didn't respond to a request for comment.
The original idea and technology behind Siri dates back to the late 1990s. Hodjat was the chief technology officer at a startup called Dejima, which he cofounded with friends from Kyushu University, in Japan. Dejima invented and patented agent-oriented technology that became part of the basis for a large-scale US government-funded AI research project called CALO, or Cognitive Assistant that Learns and Organizes. In 2007, a group of engineers from the project — which didn't include Hodjat — created a startup called Siri to commercialize the technology. Three years later, Apple acquired Siri and then rolled it out for mass-market use in iPhones in 2011. Hodjat wasn't involved with Siri after the Apple acquisition.
Hodjat is now the chief AI officer at the professional services firm Cognizant, where he is responsible for a team of AI scientists and researchers within the company's innovation labs.
In Hodjat's view, as an outside observer, the initial rollout of Siri primarily as a voice assistant was also a misstep. Apple did place more emphasis on the ability to ""type to Siri"" when it introduced its Apple Intelligence AI system last year.
""When we started at Dejima, modality to us was secondary. You can talk, you can type, it depends on where you are, and how you're interacting,"" Hodjat said.
Trying to have a conversation aloud with an inanimate object, such as a phone, can make some people feel uncomfortable, he added.
""It is surprisingly easier to talk to your car, maybe because it moves and its headlights look like eyes, than it is to your fridge,"" Hodjat said.
While there might be some discomfort, voice assistants on devices such as smartphones, wearables, and speakers are expected to reach 148.7 million users this year, according to a forecast from the research firm EMARKETER, a sister company of Business Insider. Siri is forecast to notch up around 87.3 million users in 2025, per EMARKETER's May forecast.
Despite the wide adoption, Apple has struggled to upgrade Siri for the AI age. Apple was forced to delay a planned overhaul of Siri earlier this year. Now, the company is nearing a deal to have Google's Gemini model handle some of Siri's features, Bloomberg reported this month, citing people with knowledge of the matter.
Hodjat said a Gemini deal would be a ""smart move"" for Apple, ""but only if they stay with it.""
""They keep changing their minds on this thing,"" he said.

People love a good souvenir — apparently even when it commemorates an economic disaster.
A $180 hoodie with ""2008 Global Financial Crisis"" emblazoned across the front is sold out online. The black hoodie is also described as ""hurt and mangled"" with ""extreme distressing"" by a streetwear brand called Praying.
The sweatshirt's sleeves reference December 2007 and June 2009, marking the start and end of the Great Recession.
Gen Xers and elder millennials undoubtedly remember the crisis much better than today's young adults. It was a time when the US housing bubble burst, triggering massive losses for homeowners, Wall Street, and everyday investors. The crash led to the Great Recession, sending unemployment skyrocketing as high as 10% and creating a dismal job market for years.
However, for some Gen Zers, it's something they only learned about in economics class — and, now, an opportunity to make a fashion statement.
Take, for example, NBA player Robert Dillingham, who was recently photographed wearing the hoodie. The point guard for the Minnesota Timberwolves was born in 2005, making him three years old in 2008.
back on the road again. pic.twitter.com/tpldFBJCFy
Praying has been around since 2019, founded by longtime friends Alex Haddad and Skylar Newman, according to an interview the duo gave to Vogue Hong Kong in 2022. Since then, it's been worn by stars like Megan Thee Stallion and Olivia Rodrigo. The founders compared their designs to memes and gave some insight into their inspiration.
""When these phrases are stripped of their original context and meaning, and printed on clothing and products on a large scale, they are transformed into a provocative message,"" Haddad told Vogue.
The brand also sells other financial crisis clothing, including a jersey, polo, and a $72 ""dirty tee,"" which are all sold out.
As time passes from global events, they become more abstract, and thus memes and jokes are born from generations who were either too young to fully understand the seriousness or who weren't alive at the time.
More than 20 years following the events of September 11, 2001, 9/11 jokes are more casual than ever, another example of how Gen Z doesn't shy away from dark humor.
In response to the Timberwolves' post that featured Dillingham wearing the hoodie, many people commented, asking where they could purchase it.
One social media user, though, replied with a still from ""The Big Short,"" showing Christian Bale's portrayal of Michael Burry, who famously predicted the 2008 financial crisis. There's a good chance many millennials and Gen Xers reacted to the hoodie with a similar expression.

Good music can instantly lift your mood and bring life to gatherings. If you host often or like to enjoy your favorite tracks with a rich, room-filling sound, having a solid speaker is a must. The best ones out there offer a mix of portability, reliable battery life, and, of course, deep sound.
If you’re looking to grab such an option without paying the full price, we come bearing good news. Thanks to an early Black Friday deal, the top-rated Beats Pill speaker, which typically goes for $150, is currently available for just $100. That’s after a nice 33% discount, and it applies to all color options. Like your audio gear basic? Consider the black option. Need something a bit more cheerful? The red pill (quite literally) is going to look stunning! Note that this deal gets you just the speaker. If you’re looking to pair it with a handy USB-C charging cable, the bundle is going for $110 (down from $168); just ten bucks more.
See at Amazon
Both deals are open to both Prime and non-Prime members. There are no complicated steps to take care of to score the discount, either. We highly recommend jumping on the offer fast, as it could wrap up any moment now. Considering how this is one of the lowest prices we have seen the speaker drop to ever, we’re also not expecting it to stay in stock for long.
The speaker is truly portable. It’s shaped like a pill and is quite lightweight. There’s a removable lanyard that makes it easy to carry around. Take it off when you want a cleaner look, or don’t want it to get the way during outdoor activities. The overall material is quite durable as well, meaning the Pill can handle everyday wear and tear like a champ.
When it comes to performance, Beats has packed the speaker with a bigger, bespoke racetrack woofer that can displace 90% more air volume to deliver fuller bass. The redesigned tweeter takes care of all the highs and lows in your favorite tracks to offer better clarity. Expect minimal distortion even when you are listening to songs at high volume. Vibing to the latest Taylor Swift song or trying to keep your child entertained with a lullaby, the Beats Pill fills the room with high-quality audio that pulls you in.
There’s also support for lossless audio, which you can enjoy by connecting your speaker to your laptop or other compatible devices via the USB-C cable. This mode retains all the data from the source recording to preserve full, original quality. It basically gets you higher-quality audio, so you can enjoy tracks to the fullest. Want an even bigger experience? Pair two of these together to listen in the Amplify mode or Stereo mode.
It’s IP67-rated for dust and water resistance. Take it to the beach or by the pool without a worry. And even though Beats is owned by Apple, the speaker plays nicely with both Apple and Android devices. Pairing literally takes a few minutes, and once you have it connected to your phone or laptop, you can even take calls directly through it!
A single charge gets you up to 24 hours of battery life, which is more than enough to get the party going all day and all night. Even better, it doubles as a power bank when needed. Plug your device in via USB-C cable and juice it up without stepping away from the dance floor.
All things considered, the Beats Pill speaker is a great option to consider if you’re looking for a powerful, yet portable Bluetooth speaker. It’s now down to $100, which is basically nothing considering the features it packs.

63,2025-11-21,"US labor market data presented conflicting signals, with rising unemployment alongside stronger-than-expected job additions. Experts noted a softening underlying trend, suggesting an economy that is slow to hire and fire. Markets reacted to the mixed data by pushing the dollar lower and increasing the probability of a December Fed rate cut.

Menlo Park-based brokerage firm Robinhood’s stock fell more than 11% this week as uncertainty over rate cuts cooled investors’ appetites for risk and bitcoin hit an eight month low, a slide that also coincided with cofounder Baiju Bhatt’s $48.7 million dollar stock sale.
Robinhood stock was up more than 1% Friday morning after falling 12.7% Thursday to close at $106.21.
The drop capped a heavy week of selling that pushed shares as low as 15.3% below Monday’s open and cut Robinhood's value by 28% so far in November.
Regulatory filings also show Robinhood cofounder Baiju Bhatt unloaded 418,338 shares worth $48.7 million this week.

Marvel RivalsOverwatch 2 
Ever since Marvel Rivals launched last December, itâs been hit with well-founded accusations of ripping off Overwatch. From gameplay modes to hero kits, NetEaseâs superhero shooter is chock-full of what feel like direct pulls from Blizzardâs trailblazing game. But now that Marvel Rivals has been out long enough for Overwatch 2 to be learning from it, the rip-off accusations have come full circle. The latest target of such critiques is Overwatch 2âs new hero Vendetta, who Marvel Rivals fans argue is similar to one of its heroes because sheâ¦uses a big sword, I guess.
Though the realities of how long it takes to develop content for Overwatch 2 are at odds with a lot of these claims, the internet loves a narrative. If Blizzard introduces a third-person mode a few months after Marvel Rivals launches, those committed to misunderstanding how video game development works will hoop and holler about how Blizzard is chasing NetEaseâs success, despite Overwatch 2âs third-person Stadium mode having been in development far longer than the few months its competitor had been on the market.Â 
Now, however, itâs been long enough that Overwatch 2 can introduce a character or concept that could have conceivably been pulled from Marvel Rivals, and fans are accusing Vendetta, with her sword-based fighting style and mobility skills, of being modeled on Magik from NetEaseâs game. Others, meanwhile, are pointing out that âlady with big swordâ is hardly a trademarked concept, and arguing that Overwatch and Marvel Rivals should be learning from each other.

Marvel Rivals was pretty much doomed to be called an Overwatch clone, so even as its fans are getting their own jabs in, this narrative is probably always going to follow both games. Marvel Rivals just launched Gambit, and the strategistâs kit is earning him comparisons to characters like Overwatch 2âs Wuyang, even though the character was leaked long before Wuyang joined the other gameâs roster. But thatâs pretty common with any two games with a public rivalry. Call of Duty and Battlefield are always pitted against each other, with each new entry learning from the previous yearâs successes and failures, and implementing features that look suspiciously like something the other has done.

The Samsung 990 Pro 2TB is the best-seller among internal SSDs on Amazon this Black Friday, and that makes total sense given what you’re getting. Storage speed is the single greatest determinant of whether your computer feels snappy or sluggish, as fast SSDs eliminate boot delays, application loading, and file transfer bottlenecks. This drive delivers flagship performance at pricing that makes it the best value proposition in the SSD market right now. Amazon has it down to $169 for Black Friday, down from $229, which marks a record low that places professional-grade storage well within reach of anyone building or upgrading a PC.
See at Amazon
The sequential read speed of 7,450 MB/s represents the ceiling of what PCIe Gen 4 technology can do. You boot Windows in under 10 seconds, fire up applications in an instant, and transfer large files between drives in a matter of seconds-not minutes. In-game loading, when the game is loaded on this drive, is faster than on SATA SSDs or hard drives, with some titles eliminating loading screens altogether through DirectStorage support. It makes a big difference in day-to-day use, where everything from opening folders to extracting compressed files happens faster than you expect.
Sequential write speeds reach 6,900 MB/s to handle large file creation and modification with ease. For video editors working with 4K or 8K footage, timeline scrubbing remains smooth, while render times significantly decrease. Content creators exporting large projects onto this drive find transfers complete in a fraction of the time that SATA drives normally would take.
The 2TB capacity allows for installing your OS, applications, and a substantial game library without relying on secondary storage. Modern games take up 50-150GB each, and with this capacity, you can store 15-40 titles depending on how large the files are. You keep the most played games installed and ready, instead of always having to reinstall and uninstall based on which one you want to play.
To achieve these speeds, the PCIe Gen 4 interface uses four lanes of bandwidth on compatible motherboards. The M.2 2280 form factor fits into the standard slots on modern motherboards without the need for adapters or special mounting hardware. This drive will work in older systems that have PCIe Gen 3 slots but will run at reduced speeds limited by that interface. Most motherboards from the past five years support PCIe Gen 4, making this drive compatible with the majority of current builds.
The thermal solution involves a heat spreader that radiates the heat during continuous operation. High-speed SSDs generate thermal energy during continuous intensive read and write operations, and proper cooling keeps performance within limits. The included spreader does its work quite effectively in most scenarios, but it’s even better with systems that have dedicated M.2 heatsinks or motherboard cooling solutions. The drive implements thermal throttling, which drops the speeds temporarily when temperatures exceed safe limits, ensuring hardware protection while continuing operation.
Drive management tools such as performance optimization, firmware updates, and health monitoring are available through Samsung Magician software. You manage remaining drive life, securely erase data, and optimize settings for different workloads. The software normally runs in the background, usually alerting you to firmware updates or potential issues before they can become a problem.
At $169, you get Samsung’s flagship SSD with PCIe Gen 4 speeds for 26% off, dropping pro performance down to the mid-range drive price class.

You spend roughly a third of your life sleeping so the air quality in your bedroom is crucial in terms of health and quality of rest. The same can be said for living rooms, home offices, and other places where you will be spending plenty of time. Good-quality air purifiers aren’t cheap with premium models from reputable brands coming in well above the $200 threshold. However, Blueair breaks that pattern this Black Friday by offering an all-time low on Amazon – dropping the Blue Pure 211i Max down to $199 from its usual $349 price (42% off). This is the best pricing ever seen on one of the most effective air purification systems on the market.
See at Amazon
The HEPASilent dual-filtration system combines mechanical and electrostatic filtration to achieve better performance than standard HEPA filters alone. This technology cleans the air up to 83% faster while generating 50% less noise than traditional HEPA systems. The purifier can process enough air to clean a 3,048 square foot space in one hour, a 1,524 square foot room in 30 minutes, or the typical 635 square foot bedroom in about 12 minutes on high speed.
The filtration captures 99.97% of airborne particles down to 0.1 microns, going smaller than what standard HEPA filters catch. This means the system removes viruses, smoke particles, pet dander, pollen, mold spores, and dust with exceptional efficiency. Light household odors from cooking, pets, and smoke are handled by the layer in the carbon filter, but it does much better with fresher odors than deeply embedded ones.
Quiet Mark certification confirms this is a purifier that runs at 23 to 53 decibels depending on the fan speed. The lowest setting is quieter than a whisper and thus can be applied in bedrooms during sleep with no disturbance. Even the highest speed remains below regular conversation levels, so you can easily run this device during the day without its interfering with your work calls or TV watching. Impressively, it keeps the noise level low, considering how much air this unit is actually capable of moving.
Smart app integration allows remote control of the purifier, programming operation times, and air quality monitoring from your phone. The Welcome Home geofencing feature automatically turns the purifier on when you approach home so the air is clean by the time you arrive. Clean Air ETA lets you know how much time until a room reaches your target level of air quality.
The onboard pollution sensor measures particles PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 in real time and displays results through a 5-color air quality index. If air quality changes-whether from cooking, opening windows, or other activities that introduce particles-you see immediate feedback. In auto mode, the fan speeds ramp up as pollution builds and ramp down as the air cleans up. This automation means you do not need to constantly adjust settings yourself.
The advanced functionalities are kept simple with the two-button design and LED display. You control fan speeds from 1 to 4, engage night mode for minimal noise and lighting, adjust the brightness of the display, and utilize child lock to avoid accidental changes. Alexa voice control provides another layer of convenience in the form of hands-free adjustments.
You’re getting the top-performing Blueair purifier for 43% off at $199 and brings premium air cleaning into budget territory. Meanwhile, combining fast cleaning speeds with quiet operation and smart features usually means paying $300 or more from competing brands.

73,2025-11-21,"Black Friday is one week away, though you don't have to wait that long for discounts and bargains, as many Black Friday deals have already gone live. Shoppers wanting to buy one of Apple's newest iPhones should know there's good and bad news about the iPhone 17. First of all, Apple announced its Black Friday 2025 shopping event, and the iPhone 17 models aren't included. That's hardly a surprise, as Apple usually avoids including the newest iPhone series in its Black Friday promotions. Better iPhone 17 deals might be available from electronics retailers and carriers, assuming the iPhone 17 is in stock.
On that note, let's talk about availability. Some models are in stock, but the standard iPhone 17 model is still sold out online. The cheapest iPhone 17 model has the longest delivery times, with buyers having to wait 1-2 weeks to have their unit shipped. The iPhone 17 Pro Max is also sold out, but shipping estimates have improved compared to last week.
BGR has been tracking the iPhone 17 shortages every week since preorders opened. The iPhone 17 Pro Max, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 have been consistently sold out since September 12. The iPhone Air is the only new model that has been widely available since launch. In recent weeks, iPhone 17 Pro stock has also improved significantly. As you'll see below, the smaller Pro model continues to be widely available.
Every Friday, we conduct the same inventory check on Apple's regional online stores. We load the product page for each of the four iPhone models and check every possible storage and color combination. Apple's system then offers delivery estimates for each model. Our findings this week indicate that Apple might be catching up with iPhone 17 Pro Max demand. Delivery estimates range from ""in stock""/""1 business day"" to ""3-5 business days"" in several markets, including the U.S. Some colors or storage options might ship faster than others, so consumers will need to decide how long they want to wait for a specific model:
There's no telling when the base iPhone 17 model will see similar improvements. Shipping estimates remain at 1-2 weeks for the U.S. and Canada, similar to last week. Also, the cheapest model is sold out online in the U.K. and China, where it was in stock last week. This indicates supply can fluctuate from week to week, suggesting that inventory checks might differ from one day to another, depending on the market. There's no guarantee that stock will improve by next week for any of the models that are sold out this Friday."

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Update: November 21 11:30 am ET: In a statement, an Nvidia spokesperson told Tom's Hardware; ""After another quarter of incredible growth and off-the-charts demand, Jensen’s message to the company was to stay focused and let the market take care of itself."" The rest of the story remains as published below. 
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has reportedly told Nvidia employees in a leaked all-hands meeting that “the market did not appreciate” the AI giant despite the company’s record-breaking quarter, according to Business Insider. The company’s stock price slid from around $195 to a low of $180 just one day after it released its quarterly earnings, which is a surprise given Nvidia’s performance. This meant that its market capitalization dropped from its all-time high of $5.12 trillion to around $4.4 trillion, with the company losing around $365 billion in just one day of trading.
It seems that this movement is driven by fears of an AI bubble, something that many experts and analysts, including former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, have been warning about. “If we delivered a bad quarter, it is evidence there’s an AI bubble. If we delivered a great quarter, we are fueling the AI bubble,” Jensen said during the meeting. He also added, “If we delivered a bad quarter, if we’re off by just a hair, if it just looked a little bit creaky, the whole world would’ve fallen apart.”
Nvidia has quickly grown from a relatively unknown company familiar only to gamers to becoming the most valuable company in the history of the world. This is largely driven by the massive demand for AI chips, as many companies, even nations, are racing for technological supremacy in this field. Because of this, it has arguably become the cornerstone of advancements in artificial intelligence. “You should’ve seen some of the memes that are on the internet,” the CEO said. “We’re basically holding the planet together — and it’s not untrue.”
Despite its market and technological leadership (or because of it), Huang has admitted that it has been harder for Nvidia to meet expectations. This is seen with the recent changes in the company’s stock price, which has been trending down since it peaked at over $200 in late October and early November. However, this movement is seemingly driven more by investor jitters rather than Nvidia’s performance, especially as it reported that all its data center GPUs were sold out during the quarter. It also expects the sales blitz to continue well into 2026, with the company forecasting its 4Q26 revenue to hit $62 billion.
In a statement of response, an Nvidia spokesperson told Tom's Hardware, ""After another quarter of incredible growth and off-the-charts demand, Jensen’s message to the company was to stay focused and let the market take care of itself.""

It's never been easier to ditch Google search.
Just ask Mohamed Mura, a 37-year-old professional based in London, who began pulling back from the search engine during the pandemic.
Instead of typing into Google, he turned to TikTok for questions like ""how to change a watch band."" With the launch of ChatGPT in 2022, Mura's Google usage dropped further. He said the AI chatbot felt like a ""second brain or agent"" he could bounce ideas off of.
He now uses a mix of tools for search, like ChatGPT, Grok, TikTok, Reddit, Perplexity, and yes, still sometimes Google. He's not alone. AI search tools are becoming daily habits for many.
When presented with a list of tools to use when considering a purchase, US consumers said they preferred AI chat interfaces to traditional search engines, according to an August survey of about 2,000 respondents by the consulting firm McKinsey.
Young people, in particular, are also looking beyond Google to social apps like TikTok, Reddit, Pinterest, or Instagram to find information. Nearly half (46%) of Gen Z users prefer to search on social media rather than Google, according to a survey last year from Forbes Advisor and Talker Research. That figure generally lines up with Google's own data on Gen Z's search preferences.
This story is part of a series exploring the changing online search landscape and its impact on consumers, media companies, advertisers, and tech platforms.
Stay tuned for:
""Social search is definitely a hot topic,"" Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, a senior analyst at Forrester, told Business Insider, especially as ""search behaviors fracture or distribute among a broader array of platforms aside from just Google."" In fact, more US consumers are turning to social media platforms than to AI options, such as ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot, according to a recent survey from EMARKETER, Business Insider's sister company.
Google is still king among traditional search engines and AI search tools, controlling around 90% of the global market, according to network services firm Cloudflare. Google has also responded to competition by adding AI overviews to many of its search results.
In its earnings report last month, Google's parent company Alphabet said quarterly sales from Google search rose 15% from a year ago to $56.6 billion, making up more than half of the company's overall revenue.
Google's market dominance in traditional search doesn't factor in searches on video apps like TikTok or e-commerce tools like Amazon, however. And Google's grip on the overall search landscape could loosen as the internet splinters into smaller communities.
Beyond AI chatbots and video apps, a slew of new search-focused startups, including Lore, a fandom-focused search engine, and Daydream, an e-commerce AI search tool for shopping, have emerged to support the demand for something new.
So, where are the best places to go if you want to try a new way of searching? It depends on what you're looking for.
Here are some search tips and tricks:
AI tools like ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude are great at concocting original recipes with ingredients you already have at home. Video apps like TikTok or Instagram let you search for a recipe and actually see the cooking process before you try it.
Finding new recipes was the most common use case for TikTok's search engine, a 2023 survey from Adobe found, with people saying they were looking for ""video tutorials,"" ""product or service reviews,"" and ""personal stories or anecdotes"" on the app.
Video reviews are also handy when planning a trip, allowing you to see a hotel or destination before deciding to visit. TikTok released a product this year that lets users book hotels directly from videos in the app.
Young people ""are looking for product or service recommendations and they're looking for restaurants to eat at,"" Mitchell-Wolf said. Social platforms are a ""flourishing environment"" for this category of search, she added.
If you're looking for inspiration, Pinterest can be a first stop in the search journey.
Design, particularly, is the top search use case (62%) for the moodboarding platform, according to a March survey from Adobe. Fashion advice was also popular.
A recent example: In August, Pinterest shared that searches for ""vintage fall aesthetic"" were up 1,074% year-over-year, and that there were upticks in searches around thrifted outfits, kitchen accessories, and interior decorating.
Social platforms like Instagram and TikTok can also be places to find inspiration. And for fashion specifically, there's a wave of new startups building shopping search tools, from personalized e-commerce search engines like Daydream to more niche platforms helping people find secondhand items, such as Beni.
If you already have a product in mind to buy, you might turn to the giants Amazon and Walmart. EMARKETER found that 56% of US consumers go to Amazon for search and 45% to Walmart.
""Amazon has become a major destination for product search,"" said Sky Canaves, a principal analyst at EMARKETER. ""They've taken share from Google in that space over the years because they have so many products that Prime members can typically start a search there, and then maybe they go to Google next.""
Google, famously, is a data-collection machine. When you're searching in its app, Chrome, Gmail, or some other Google-owned product, you're helping the company build a detailed advertising profile on who you are and what you're looking to buy.
Search engines and browsers like DuckDuckGo and Brave offer tools for privacy-conscious users who don't want their search habits tracked.
""We know that people are tired of being exploited online by scammers and by data-hungry companies who essentially have made it their business model to sell users out to the highest advertising bidder,"" said Beah Burger-Lenehan, SVP of product at DuckDuckGo.
Sometimes websites don't have the answers we're looking for. We want answers from everyday people.
Have you found yourself typing ""[insert search topic here] reddit"" into Google? You're not alone.
""Particularly with Gen Z or younger users, if they want to see what other people are saying, maybe they don't start on Google, they will start on TikTok or go to Reddit,"" Canaves said.
Reddit told investors that in the third quarter, over 75 million people searched on its platform each week.
The top search categories on Reddit are tech, news, and personal finance, according to a 2024 Adobe survey. However, a good chunk of people are also turning to the platform for career or relationship advice, as well as product recommendations.
In December, the company launched a chatbot search tool called Reddit Answers that summarizes user recommendations and discussions in a conversational manner. Daily query volume for the feature is up over 20% since last quarter, the company told Business Insider.
If you're simply tired of staring at the Google search bar and want something that's similar, but not owned by Google, there's always Microsoft's Bing.
You can also try out AI-powered browsers like OpenAI's Atlas and Perplexity's Comet, which allow you to search conversationally or use an AI agent to complete certain tasks.
Some AI search tools offer voice assistants, which can make searching more seamless.
""It's a lot less friction if you're speaking to an AI assistant versus having to type a long query,"" Canaves said. ""The output that you get will be a lot more nuanced than what you would get from typing in three or four keywords into a Google search bar.""

78,2025-11-21,"A state trooper said that the cat had been seen 'fighting' the bird in mid-air
Charlotte Phillipp is a Weekend Writer-Reporter at PEOPLE. She has been working at PEOPLE since 2024, and was previously an entertainment reporter at The Messenger.
North Carolina State Highway Patrol
 A driver in North Carolina was left bewildered after something crashed through her car's windshield as she was driving to work. After closer inspection, she discovered the object was a cat that had been dropped from the sky by a bald eagle.

 According to a statement from the North Carolina State Highway Patrol, the woman was driving on US-74 at 8 a.m. on Wednesday, Nov. 19, in Swain County, near Bryson City, about 65 miles outside Asheville, when the unusual collision occurred.

 The woman dialed 911 immediately and told the operator that the plummeting feline ""shattered"" her windshield.

 ""You may not believe me, but I just had a bald eagle drop a cat through my windshield. It absolutely shattered my windshield,"" the driver, who has not been named, told a 911 operator in a transcript obtained by ABC 11.

 ""I do believe you, honestly,"" the operator replied. ""I had a witness who was like, 'That is the craziest thing I've ever seen.""

 Though the North Carolina State Highway Patrol said that the woman was not injured, The Charlotte Observer reported that the cat died after the accident.

 State trooper Kosal Thach told the outlet that the cat had been seen ""fighting"" the bird in mid-air while the eagle carried the feline.

 According to the Observer, the car was going around 55 mph when the cat made impact. A photo provided by police shows the vehicle's passenger-side windshield shattered. The driver had her car towed and got a ride to work after the incident, Thach said.

 The eagle fled the scene before troopers arrived. It is unclear where the cat came from or whether the animal was a local pet.

 Bryson City is located near the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and the region is known for being home to many bald eagles.

 According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, bald eagles are the largest bird of prey species in North America. Females may have a wingspan of up to 8 feet and can weigh as much as 14 pounds, while male eagles may have a wingspan of up to 6 feet and weigh in at 10 pounds.

 Bald eagles are also opportunistic feeders, and fish serve as a staple food for the species. They also feed on waterfowl, shorebirds, waterbirds, turtles, rabbits, snakes, and small animals, catching them by swooping down from the sky and picking them up off the ground with their talons.

It's looking like investors might get their wish this holiday season.
Stocks surged on Friday on comments from a top Federal Reserve official who said the economic situation supports more rate cuts from the central bank.
The odds that the Fed will cut interest rates another 25 basis points at its December policy meeting nearly doubled on Friday after New York Fed President John Williams said that he saw room to adjust interest rates further.
The odds that the Fed will trim its target rate to 3.5%-3.75% climbed to over 70%, from about 39% on Thursday.
""I view monetary policy as being modestly restrictive, although somewhat less so than before our recent actions,"" Williams said at an event in Chile on Friday. ""Therefore, I still see room for a further adjustment in the near term to the target range for the federal funds rate to move the stance of policy closer to the range of neutral, thereby maintaining the balance between the achievement of our two goals.""
For the stock market, it's revived one of the best-case scenarios at a time when investors are scanning the horizon for positive catalysts that could spark a year-end surge in the market.
A rally that kicked off after the bell gained steam in afternoon trading. The Dow rose nearly 800 points. 
Here's where US indexes stood around 2:20 p.m. ET on Friday:
Williams' remarks come at a choppy time in markets, with concerns lingering over the health of the AI trade.
A December rate cut, meanwhile, had been in question this week as investors realized they would be getting an incomplete look at the economic data for October.
The labor market, a key focus for investors, also added 119,000 jobs in September. That was more than economists expected, which suggests that the central bank may not have as much room to cut interest rates as markets previously believed.
Fed officials have been split on the rate cut outlook going into next year, with some officials striking a more hawkish tone than others.
On Monday, Fed Gov. Christopher Waller, who is on the short-list to be the next Fed Chairman, said he supported another interest rate cut in December to prop up the labor market.
Last week, Boston Fed President Susan Collins said she would have a ""high bar"" for supporting rate cuts going forward.

89,2025-11-21,"One year ago, Strategy (MSTR), the software company that became a pioneer in buying bitcoin BTC$84,861.35 as corporate treasury asset, hit a record high and bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, was within striking distance of $100,00 for the first time.
How things change. Strategy is now 68% below its $543 peak, hit days after President Donald Trump's election victory, and bitcoin has dropped to $83,142, the lowest since April, CoinDesk data show. On Coinbase it fell even further, slipping as low as $81,385 at one point on Friday. A key level to monitor remains Strategy’s average purchase price of about $74,430.
Bitcoin’s decline from the $126,000 record it reached in early October has pushed Strategy into an even steeper slide. The stock has broken below key moving averages and technical support levels in a drawdown that is the joint second-worst since the Tysons Corner, Virginia-based company adopted its bitcoin treasury strategy back in April 2020. 
The slump is similar to the 69% drop between February and May 2021 that occurred as bitcoin fell from roughly $60,000 to around $30,000. The largest Strategy drawdown occurred after bitcoin reached a then-record $69,000 in November 2021. That was followed by an 84% sell-off that bottomed in June 2022.
Since August 2020, Strategy has experienced multiple tumbles of more than 50%.
Even so, JPMorgan warned that major equity benchmarks such as MSCI USA and the Nasdaq 100 may exclude Strategy. Such a move could trigger an estimated $2.8 billion in outflows from MSCI alone as index-matching vehicles shed their holdings of the stock. About $9 billion of the company's market cap is captured by passive investments such as exchange traded funds, the analysts wrote.
Even with the recent decline, Strategy still trades at a 1.23 multiple to net asset value (mNAV), which reflects the enterprise value of the business. During the 2022 bear market the company often traded below its mNAV creating a discount to its underlying bitcoin holdings.

    Eevee can evolve into eight different Pokemon. Here’s how to get each one for your journey.
  
Evolve Eevee into Espeon, Umbreon or Sylveon by increasing its Friendship Level.
I like to think that Eevee and its eight evolutions are the perfect Pokemon for the French-themed streets of Lumiose City, the setting for Pokemon Legends: Z-A. Each one has a unique look, type and evolution method. Luckily, the game doesn't make it too difficult to obtain each one of them. So, whether you're trying to complete the Pokedex or just want your favorite Eeveelution on your team, here's how to go about it.
Unlike previous games, Pokemon Legends Z-A doesn't take the guardrails off quickly. Before you can freely roam the streets of Lumiose to look for an Eevee of your own, you'll need to meet Emma, a detective, at the Looker Bureau -- this happens during Main Mission 5 -- and unlock side missions.
Then find your way to Vert Sector 9 during the day to capture an Eevee; because it's a fixed spawn location, you're guaranteed to find one here.
Vert Sector 9 is guaranteed to spawn Eevee.
The easiest way to get to Vert Sector 9 is by heading to Vernal Pokemon Center. It's located on Vernal Avenue, directly south of the Centrico Plaza travel spot. Once you're at the Pokemon Center, enter the alley right before the hair salon and follow the path until you see an arched gateway. It's opposite a battle court. There may be boulders blocking your path ahead, so bring a Pokemon with fighting-type moves (preferably Rock Smash or Brick Break) to get past. Then head down to the park area and you'll find yourself an Eevee.
Eevee can be found in this park during the daytime.
This Eevee will be around Level 16. It isn't skittish, so it won't disappear once it spots you, but it does have a lower catch rate. Stock up on Poke Balls and consider bringing a Pokemon that can paralyse Eevee or make it drowsy to increase your chances of capturing it.
There are a few other spots where you can capture Eevee, but this is an easy one to find. I also prefer it because of its proximity to the Vernal Pokemon Center, a fast travel spot.

Jolteon is a speedy attacker that'll make your Pokemon battles feel like a breeze.
Because there's so much variety to choose from, picking Eeveelutions for your team of six can be tricky. However, to hold an advantage in Pokemon Legends: Z-A's real-time battles, you'll want your Pokemon to have a high Speed stat. It'll shorten the cooldown period between attacks and increase your chances of winning battles.
Jolteon matches this description perfectly, and the fact that its Special Attack stat is also high (great for moves like Thunderbolt and Discharge) will mean you have a strong attacking Electric-type on your team. There are a few other strong Electric types in the game, but Jolteon will definitely come in handy for the first part of the storyline and is easy to get, as you'll read ahead.
Looking beyond Jolteon, Espeon, a psychic type, and Sylveon, a fairy type, are also options to consider. Espeon has a balanced distribution across its Special Attack, Special Defense and Speed stats. And Sylveon makes itself reliable with a focus on attacking (high Special Attack) and endurance (high Special Defense and moderate HP) stats, which can offset its slow speed.
Once you've got yourself an Eevee (or eight of them to get one of each evolution), refer to the list below to understand how to evolve it.
Pokemon Legends: Z-A doesn't make it too hard to find Evolution Stones, the items you'll need to evolve certain pokemon. You can find them as floor items throughout Lumiose City, receive them as rewards for completing side missions or buy them from the Stone Emporium store for 3,000 Pokemon Dollars.
Vaporeon is a reliable water-type Pokemon that evolves from Eevee.
Fire, Water, Thunder and Leaf Stones are available to purchase at Stone Emporium from the beginning. However, Ice Stones (required for Glaceon) only become available there after you’ve beaten the main storyline.
In case you’d like to use a Glaceon during the main storyline, you can find an Ice Stone in Rouge Sector 4. We’ve added a map screenshot below to show where you can find it. You can also find one in Lumiose Sewers (accessible during Main Mission 19) or receive it as a reward for completing Side Mission 102.
Climb atop the shopping plaza in Rouge Sector 4 to find an Ice Stone.
Note that Side Mission 102 can be started by interacting with a trainer NPC in Wild Zone 12. This trainer NPC appears after you've visited Lysandre Labs in Main Mission 35.
Eevee evolves into Umbreon during nighttime.
Unlike the five Eeveelutions that require evolution stones, to get the other three -- Espeon, Umbreon or Sylveon -- you need to have a high friendship level with your Eevee.
To tackle this, call Eevee out of its Poke Ball and visit any café for four cups of coffee. You’ll have to go through the in-game screens four different times -- and spend 1,000 Pokemon Dollars -- but you’ll leave with an Eevee that’s ready to evolve.
To get Espeon and Umbreon, make sure it’s the right time of day and that your Eevee doesn't know any fairy-type moves before selecting the Evolve option. And to get Sylveon, make sure your Eevee has learned a fairy-type move.
You can catch alpha forms of some Eeveelutions in Wild Zone 20.
One last thing: If you’d like to add some alpha Eeveelutions to your collection, Pokemon Legends: Z-A makes that possible. Once you’ve completed the main storyline, visit Wild Zone 20 to find alpha variants of Vaporeon, Jolteon, Flareon, Leafon, Glaceon and Sylveon under Prism Tower. You'll have to reset the spawns multiple times before you find one, but as we said in our catching Gengar guide, the wait might feel long, but it will be worth it because you will start with amazing stats without having to do any kind of special training."

David BaszuckiRoblox 
As “pedophile hellscape”Â Roblox finally adds a rudimentary measure to try to prevent children from being exploited via its network of games and chatrooms used by 151 million people, the company’s CEO spoke to theÂ New York Times podcast Hard Fork about child safety. And it didn’t go great. ItÂ really didn’t go great.
Roblox is coming under increasing scrutiny after decades of failing to implement even the most basic of protective measures to keep its pre-teen players away from the networks of pedophiles who use the game to find victims. Described last year as “a pedophile hellscape for kids” by Hindenburg Research, the game quickly introduced a new assortment of measuresÂ last October that did next to nothing, leading this year to a great deal of legal interest. Three months back, the state of Louisiana announced its intentions to sueÂ Roblox for the dangers it was allowing, joined since by Kentucky and Texas. These actions come alongside 35 other ongoing lawsuits, including one from only yesterday by a family in Cuyaho County following Roblox‘s alleged use in the tragic and too common abuse of their 13-year-old son.
On Wednesday of this week, Roblox announced it was beginning to roll out a new method of checking player ages before they could access chat, this time using facial recognition to try to restrict players to only talking to others in their age range. Such facial ID checks have become commonplace in the UK following the disastrously poor UK Online Safety Act, by which porn sites and other age-restricted outlets are required to verify users’ ages. This has led to sites like X, Bluesky and Discord also requiring British users to prove their age, usually by showing their face on camera in a measure that entirely thwarts all seven people who haven’t heard of a VPN.
Regarding this rollout, theÂ New York Times‘ Casey Newton spoke toÂ Roblox co-founder and CEO David Baszucki about the new plans, and whether they can really help. It doesn’t begin well. When asked about the “scope of the problem” of predators in the application, Baszucki came in shoulders first saying, “We think of it not necessarily just as a problem, but an opportunity as well.” Ah, the good ol’ opportunities available when your company’s product is rife with pedophilia. He continued, outlining how wonderful it is that young people can build and communicate together, how they have “150 million daily actives, 11 billion hours a month, like what is the best way to keep pushing this forward.” It is the most astonishingly tone-deaf response.
Newton attempts to get some sensible answers from Baszucki about how the ID checks will work, and why they won’t be as easily evaded as so many others, and amidst Baszucki’s corporate waffle he’s told that Roblox is apparently always looking out for “weird signals” and will ask for further age verification should these appear, although he didn’t explain what those signals might be, nor what these further checks would be. But then Newton goes on to ask the painfully necessary question: why has it taken 19 years to even try to stop adults from being able to speak to children?
Baszucki responds by talking about the evolution of Roblox‘s text filtering tech for inappropriate language and personally identifying information over the last two decades, and how it’s always improving, which is great but clearly not relevant to the question. Newton is having none of it, responding, “Yeah, I mean, I donât know. When I read these lawsuits and these investigations into the company, it does not seem like predators are having that hard of a time getting around your filters…So Iâm curious whatâs made you so confident that things are working?” Baszucki’s response is incoherent.
“I donât want to comment on it. We do see the chat logs of those. And we can see interesting and, many times, ways of people trying toâIâd say, many times people who are fairly sophisticated, and Iâm not going to say all of them, many times kids who are over 13, who actually in any other app are not running in a filtered situation, unfortunately, figuring out how to jump to some other platform where they can communicate unfiltered, where they can share images, all of it. Itâs one of the primary things weâre doing is trying to keep people on our platform. Itâs an interesting industry situation. I would say, weâre not waiting for the rest of the industry. Weâre like, weâre always trying to stay ahead of it. On the California age-appropriate design code, for example, weâre like, we are already doing all of that stuff. And the same thing with age estimation: Weâre not doing this because of any laws that are coming, we think itâs the right thing to do.”
Newton very impressively keeps his cool, and rather than pointing out that this answer had nothing to do with the situation, nor indeed how unbelievable it is that the CEO of the company would say “I don’t want to comment on it” when asked why he’s confident in age tech that clearly doesn’t work, he instead points out that the lawsuits are demonstrating that “Roblox is kind of, you know, where predators go to find kids.”
Things become increasingly tense, as Baszucki tries to claim this is a misrepresentation, and when pressed on whether he truly doesn’t believeÂ Roblox has a predator problem replies, “I think we’re doing an incredible job at innovating relative to the number of people on our platform and the hours, in really leaning in to the future of how this is going to work.”
What becomes so grimly apparent is that even now, even after a year of extraordinary scrutiny and legal pressure, Baszucki still doesn’t have a grip on the situation at all. To be so ill-prepared for such obvious questions, to have no coherent responses for why the new tech will be effective, and to go so out of his way to appear so uninterested in the subject, is astonishing. As he’s pressed further on the ease with which predators can suggest children speak to them on another platform, Baszucki eventually unravels into literal gibberish:
“I would actually say that is a very simple red flag. Like, that sounds like text filter many prior generations. So I would say the techniques are much more sophisticated than that. Weâre constantly getting better than that and sometimes itâs adversarial. Like, weâre getting into, you know, if we cryptographically were going to try to have an exchange of how to share your Snap handle or whatever handle. We see some of that starting, like things weâll have to essentially prevent in the future.”
The CEO seems to believe that the scale ofÂ Roblox is somehow an excuse to justify its problems, repeatedly coming back to its 150 million users and 11 billion hours a month, as if this explains it all away. But more problematically, as Newton points out that the company wants those numbers to grow, Baszucki immediately switches back to talking about what an amazing financial opportunity this is. GivenÂ RobloxÂ is really struggling to turn those users into money, it reads like he’s only speaking to investors and analysts who are increasingly concerned aboutÂ Roblox‘s lack of profits. So many responses begin with an infuriatingly irrelevant attempt to avoid the question, and then end with words like “And you could imagineÂ Roblox at 20-X this scale, having 50 percent of the gaming market space all in a single place.” It’s so crass!
But not nearly as crass as Baszucki’s response to a question over the Hindenburg Research report into the scale of the issue with pedophiles. Hindenburg was an activist short-selling research firm that would investigate companies for fraud, malfeasance and indeed rampant use by predators, until its creator chose to disband the group in January this year. At the time of the report, Baszucki said that it was wrong to claim thatÂ Roblox had reduced its spend on trust and safety, so Newton asked for specifics.
“Fun,” says Baszucki, a man who appears pathologically incapable of reading the room. “Let’s keep going down this. And so, first off, Hindenburg is not longer in existence, correct? So, you should report on that. They went out of business for some reason…” He then demanded to know if Newton had researched the answer for himself, before saying that it’s because they’ve moved so much of the safety regulation onto AI, all while sounding absolutely furious that he was being asked. He then demands that Newton agree that if AI is more effective, it’s better to use it, and when Newton does, Baszucki starts to behave incredibly immaturely. “Good, so you’re aligning with what we did. High-five.” Then when Newton tries to ask a question, he interrupts to say, “Thank you for supporting our Roblox decision matrix.”Â Then interrupts yet again to say, “I’m so glad you guys are aligned with the way we runÂ Roblox. High-five.” Think he’s done? Nope. Yet again he interrupts the question with, “Is this a stealth interview where actually you love everything we’re doing and you’re here to stealthily support it?”
And he doesn’t stop. When co-host Kevin Roose tried to get things back on the rails, Baszucki kept going with the same pathetic line. Challenged on how AI has proved very ineffective for social media companies, he just carries on saying it. The only thing that stopped this tantrum was allowing the CEO to talk about Polymarket, a cryptoscam-based prediction market, letting people place bets on things as ridiculous as awards ceremonies and future weather patterns. Some believe it’s becoming a useful way to predict markets, and that group includes Baszucki who is…and I cannot believe I’m typing this…looking to put it into Roblox so children can gamble.
He wants to find a way to do this that’s “legal” and “educational,” at which point the podcast hosts begin openly mocking the stupidity. And then, thank god, they run out of time.

The sprawling Dadonggou gold mine, which lies under the Liaoning province of northeast China, would easily lure Smaug out of his lair. Searching for a glimpse of precious metal, workers unearthed a deposit of about 2.9 billion tons of ore containing over 498 tons (996,000 pounds) of pure gold. With the recent upsurge in gold prices that shows no signs of slowing down, this motherlode could be worth at least $192 billion—not quite as much as Elon Musk, but close enough. 
Gold surfaced in droves after nearly a thousand government employees explored and drilled for 15 months as part of a project meant to develop the mine. After previously forming a development partnership, China National Gold Group, Liaoning Mineral Geology Group, and the Yingkou Municipal Government now plan to invest about $2.82 billion (20 billion yuan) into boosting the local gold industry by building a massive industrial complex. Funding will cover every phase of this endeavor through 2027, from exploration and mining to facilities for storage, processing, smelting and producing gold jewelry.  
Why are so many veins of gold running through China? Its vast land mass rests on several tectonic plates. Geological activity creates conditions ideal for the formation of the element known as aurum in Latin, which is what gives gold its abbreviation Au. Volcanic activity or magma in Earth’s mantle heats subsurface water, which will then dissolve traces of gold from deep in the crust. Fluid will then seep through fractures in the crust. Exposed to changes in pressure and temperature, dissolved gold will become unstable and crystallize. It will precipitate out of the solution and solidify, accumulating into a solid deposit. Many gold veins are millions to billions of years old. 
Gold also occurs in fluids that quartz crystallizes from. Quartz is piezoelectric, meaning mechanical stress forces it to generate an electric charge. This explains why forces from earthquakes can produce gold. When pressure levels plummet low enough, water evaporates quickly from mineral solutions, and minerals such as quartz crystallize. Earthquakes exert intense stress on quartz, which responds by releasing piezoelectric discharge that can deposit gold nanoparticles from a solution. Veins will keep amassing more gold as the process repeats.
This is the largest gold deposit found in China since 1949, with the second-largest being  another underground deposit geologists discovered last year, which was hiding an estimated $83 billion worth of gold. The Ministry of Natural Resources is confident that Dadonggou could be the beginning of a massive and profitable production base that could make China a leader in the gold industry. It closely trails Russia and Australia currently.
“The mine’s more than 1,000 tons of reserves will significantly secure national gold strategic reserves,” CPC Shenyang municipal Party school professor Wang Yan told China Daily. “Its fully integrated industrial chain from production to sales will greatly influence the gold industry in China, enhancing its competitiveness in the global market.”
Maybe this is the El Dorado we’ve been seeking all along.

Fallout 4ModsMorning Checkpoint 
Modders celebrate 10 years of improving Fallout 4 with their own anniversary collection, Liam Hemsworth’s Geralt earns a big defender, and the very good Analogue 3D (I’ve tested it but still need to publish my full review) is finally getting a Bluetooth N64 controller that actually looks cool. Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, our daily roundup of gaming news and culture. It’s Black Friday season which means I’m about to stock up on extra controllers to replace the ones my kids keep breaking. It’s not great that modern game pads cost more than ever and wear out twice as fast.
The package includes a curated round-up of all of the community’s favorite free fan-made add-ons for Bethesda’s decade-old RPG. But the Fallout 4: Anniversary Collection is more than that. “Itâs a thank-you to the creators whoâve kept Fallout 4 evolving long after launch, and a gift to players returning to the Wasteland with fresh eyes,” wrote Nexus user ModularCocoon. “Whether this is your first playthrough in years or your fifteenth settlement build this month, this is the Commonwealth at its most refined: a snapshot of what ten years of modding can achieve.”
That’s in contrast to the official update from Bethesda which recently messed a bunch of things up and drove the game down to its lowest user rating ever on Steam with “overwhelming negative” reviews. “Game has been out for a decade and received two recent updates,” one player wrote. “I still get a black screen on startup and have to track down an ini file to make it work.” Bethesda is trying to fix it.
The 2023 release recently received its new, free Valley of Memory DLC expanding on Basim’s adventure with new content and new parkour options. But it also got rid of the ability to toggle motion blur off, in addition to tuning up the effect way beyond what fans were used to. It’s been making players dizzy and making the game look bad. Ubisoft promised it’s prioritizing a fix to add the settings toggle back in ASAP.
Doug Cockle, who voices Geralt in the Witcher video games, says Liam Hemsworth, who now plays him in Netflix’sÂ The Witcher series, is doing a fine job, despite season 4’s abominable reception and ratings.
“I loved Henry. He was a fantastic Witcher, Geralt, specifically, so I was sad to see him go, but I have watched the newest season, and I think Liam holds up pretty well,” Cockle told GamesRadar. “He’s different. He’s made it his own character, and that’s what he should have done as an actor, and I think he’s done a fantastic job. So I’m looking forward to seeing Season Five eventually, and seeing where it goes.”
8BitDo 64 Bluetooth Controller for Analogue 3D (Grey) up for preorder on 8BitDo ($44.99) https://t.co/Jd9OH3869E pic.twitter.com/P8Si5rhRsQ

8bitdo just revealed a gray variant of its Bluetooth controller for its new retro console that plays Nintendo 64 games. It’s $45 and looks great compared to the all-black base model, but it’s not shipping until the end of January 2026. Hopefully, it has a better thumbstick than the current Analogue 3D controllers as well.
Magic: The Gathering designer Gavin Verhey said he’s into the idea of a collaboration with the surprise turn-based RPG hit of 2025. âMy general theory recently is that gaming brands are just really good collaborations for Magic,” he told Dexerto. “When you bring someone new in with a gaming collaboration, theyâre already gamers. You donât have to explain what hit points are, what an objective is, or what mana is. They just get it.”
He added, âI mean, itâs the talk of the town this year right? Expedition 33 would be really fun to get to do…who knows if itâll happen or if theyâre even up for that kind of thing, right?â
The remake port was quietly shadow-dropped this week with a big 50 percent off discount. Any Xbox fans who haven’t already played it on another platform can grab it for just $35, which is almost as good as having it on Game Pass (or even better for those who prefer to own). Konami recently teased that it’s planning more Silent Hill games in addition to the recently released Silent Hill f and an in-development remake of Silent Hill 1.

95,2025-11-21,"As you know, the official Amazon 2025 Black Friday Week deals are now live alongside the best price yet on the new AirPods Pro 3 and AirPods 4 with ANC at $110 shipped. But today we are featuring a new Amazon all-time low on the base model AirPods 4 that are now sitting down at $80 shipped. Amazon is also undercutting everyone with new lows on M5 MacBook Pro configurations at up to $157 off the list prices alongside the most affordable M5 iPad Pro models at up to $100 off for Black Friday Week. Those deals join up to 43% off Apple’s official iPhone 17/Pro/Max and iPhone Air cases from $27 and Amazon’s best deals on Beats 5-foot USB-C woven cables from $8.50. All of that awaits below alongside Black Friday pricing on M3 iPad Air, iPad mini 7, and  iPad 11 from $279. 
The Black Friday Week sales are now live and we are not only tracking new lows on Apple’s brand new M5 MacBook Pro but Amazon is now slightly undercutting all of the other major retailers on the most affordable configurations starting down at $1,442 shipped.
Amazon is now offering the least expensive model with 16GB of RAM and the 512GB SSD down at $1,442 shipped. Regularly $1,599, this is a straight up $155 off the list price and the new Amazon low that slightly undercuts the official $149 discounts we are seeing at other major retailers. This also applies to the upgraded 1TB model. While the latter isn’t seeing price drops quite as low as the other two, it too is sitting at the Amazon low right now:
While Amazon’s prices on the Silver and Space Black treatments aren’t identical right now, they are by and large within a few bucks of each other outside of the 24GB – only the Space Black is at a notable price on that one.
The brand new MacBook is the first and only Mac to carry Apple’s new M5 chip and, at this point, it will likely remain as such until Apple finally decides to unleash the M5 Pro/Max models (or something along those lines), but it appears that won’t be until 2026 at this point.
For those looking to land a new MacBook for a whole lot less, we recommend taking a look at the current-generation M4 MacBook Air. You can score one of those at all-time low pricing on Amazon right now as part of its Black Friday Week sale – every configuration is $250 off with deals starting at roughly half the price of the M5 MacBook Pro.
We are already highlighted deals on Apple’s more affordable current-generation iPad models – iPad 11 at $280, iPad mini from $399, and the M3 iPad Air from $449, but now it’s time for the big boy. Apple recently unleashed the first iPad with its new M5 chip and we are now tracking some new all-time low prices at $100+ off, including the most affordable of the lot.
The more affordable models across the lineup are now up to $100 off, all which are now either sitting at new all-time lows or matching the best we have tracked since release. There are some deeper deals on the high-end machines with as much as $138 and as much as $170 in savings, but really only on the top-tier and particularly pricey 2TB and nano-texture variants. 
Here’s a look at how pricing is landing across the lineup for Amazon’s Black Friday Week sale:
Now joining the Amazon Black Friday Week sale, alongside all-time lows on AirPods 4, AirPods 4 with ANC, and AirPods Pro 3, we are now tracking some solid discounts on Apple’s official iPhone 17 case lineup. This includes models for iPhone 17, 17 Pro, 17 Pro Max, and the new iPhone Air with as much as 43% in savings slashed for the list prices. You’ll find all of the discounted iPhone 17/Pro/Max models on sale here, and the iPhone Air options here, with additional details on everything down below.
While not every color for every phone model is in stock and marked down, there is a healthy selection of deals up for grabs, many of which are matching or slightly undercutting the Prime Day prices we featured last month.






The official Amazon 2025 Black Friday Week sale is now live with the best price ever on the new AirPods Pro 3 and AirPods 4 with ANC at a new$110 all-time low, but it has also brought back is best prices across every single M4 MacBook Air configuration it carries at a full$250 off the list price.
We have already raved about the $249 price drops that hit the M4 MacBook Air lineup earlier in the month. While those deals did eventually jump back up, before stock started to dwindle on select configs and colors thereafter, the entire suite of $250 price drops is now live once again. 
Amazon’s 2025 Black Friday Week sale is now delivering M4 MacBook models starting from $749 – $1 below the early sale – but, perhaps equally as notable is that all colors and RAM/storage configurations are now back in stock across both the 13- and 15-inch form-factors:
