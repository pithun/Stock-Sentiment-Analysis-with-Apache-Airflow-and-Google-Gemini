Warren Buffett plans to keep writing a yearly letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders — but it'll be in November, not May.
The famed investor, 95, rocked the business world this spring by announcing he would step down as CEO at the end of this year. In a letter published Monday, he said that he would cease writing Berkshire's annual report and ""talking endlessly"" at Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting, but he's only ""sort of"" going quiet.
""I will continue talking to you and my children about Berkshire via my annual Thanksgiving message,"" he wrote, adding that he appreciates his shareholders' generosity and enjoys staying in touch with them.
Buffett also hailed his planned successor, Greg Abel. ""I can't think of a CEO, a management consultant, an academic, a member of government — you name it — that I would select over Greg to handle your savings and mine,"" he wrote.
The outgoing Berkshire boss, who's worth around $150 billion, said he would ""step up"" the pace at which he's disbursing his fortune to the foundations of his three children — Susie, Howard, and Peter.
As his children are now in their late 60s and early 70s, Buffett wrote, he wants to boost the chances that they can distribute ""what will essentially be my entire estate"" before they need to be replaced by alternate trustees.
""My children are now at their prime in respect to experience and wisdom but have yet to enter old age,"" he said. ""That 'honeymoon' period will not last forever.""
However, Buffett said he planned to retain a ""significant amount"" of his Berkshire stock until his shareholders ""develop the comfort with Greg that Charlie [Munger] and I long enjoyed,"" but added that he didn't expect that process to take long.
In his letter, Buffett said he was grateful to have lived into his mid-90s, given he ""nearly died"" as a child in 1938, when he had to have an emergency appendectomy, and his life was saved by doctors on two other occasions.
The billionaire also reflected on how lucky he's been and how unfair life can be.
""Dynastic inheritors have achieved lifetime financial independence the moment they emerged from the womb, while others have arrived, facing a hell-hole,"" he wrote, adding that if he were born in some other parts of the world, he ""would likely have had a miserable life and my sisters would have had one even worse.""
Buffett said that Lady Luck has been good to him over the years, but ""she has better things to do than work with those in their 90s,"" whereas Father Time ""now finds me more interesting as I age.""
The nonagenarian said that he feels good, continues to work at Berkshire's headquarters five days a week, and still contributes to the company.
""Occasionally, I get a useful idea or am approached with an offer we might not otherwise have received,"" he wrote. ""Because of Berkshire's size and because of market levels, ideas are few — but not zero.""
Much of Buffett's latest missive served as a love letter to his hometown of Omaha. He reflected on the lives of several close friends and business associates, including his late right-hand man, Munger, and former Coca-Cola president Don Keough, and how Omaha played a role in all of their lives.
Buffett also struck a measured but positive tone on Berkshire's prospects, although ""our size takes its toll."" He said that Berkshire has ""less chance of a devastating disaster"" and a ""more shareholder-conscious management and board"" than virtually any other company he's come across.
After warning that Berkshire's stock price will occasionally plunge 50%, as it has done three times during his time in charge, Buffett wrote: ""Don't despair; America will come back and so will Berkshire shares.""
The so-called Oracle of Omaha also offered some life advice, encouraging readers to learn from their mistakes, ""get the right heroes,"" and live lives deserving of the obituaries they desire.
""When you help someone in any of thousands of ways, you help the world,"" he wrote. ""Kindness is costless but also priceless.""
Buffett signed off by wishing a happy Thanksgiving to his readers — ""even the jerks"" — and reminding his shareholders to ""thank America"" for the opportunities it has provided, even though it can be ""capricious and sometimes venal in distributing its rewards.""
Buffett embraced his new Thanksgiving tradition for a third consecutive year. Expressing his admiration for his three children's philanthropic work, he gifted Berkshire stock to their foundations.
The investor said that on Monday, he converted 1,800 of his Class A shares into 2.7 million Class B shares, worth about $1.35 billion. He pledged to distribute 1.5 million of those shares to the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation — named after his late wife — and 400,000 shares to each of his kids' foundations: the Sherwood Foundation, the Howard G. Buffett Foundation, and NoVo Foundation.
Buffett has given away close to 60% of his Berkshire shares since pledging to give 99% of them to good causes in 2006.
The legendary stock picker has charged his three kids with distributing his Berkshire shares, which make up 99.5% of his wealth, to worthy causes once he's gone.
Abel, Berkshire's head of non-insurance operations, is set to succeed Buffett as CEO in the new year with Buffett staying on as chairman.
Berkshire was a failing textile mill when Buffett acquired it in 1965. He has spent the past 60 years transforming it into one of the world's largest companies with roughly $400 billion in annual revenue, 400,000 employees, and a $1 trillion market value.
Berkshire owns scores of businesses, including Geico, See's Candies, and the BNSF Railway, and ranks as one of the largest shareholders of huge companies such as Apple, Bank of America, and Coca-Cola.
Buffett has also delivered outsize returns to his shareholders. Berkshire stock rose 5,500,000% between 1965 and 2024, trouncing the S&P 500's 39,000% gain during that period, the company's latest annual report shows.
News of Buffett's impending departure has weighed on Berkshire stock: it has climbed 10% this year, trailing the S&P's 16% gain. That may have been a factor in Buffett reassuring shareholders in his latest letter that he intends to hang on to a big chunk of his shares until Abel wins them over.
Buffett, perhaps the world's foremost bargain hunter, has balked at high prices for stocks and companies in recent years. Berkshire's third-quarter earnings this month showed it was a net seller of stocks for a 12th straight quarter, and refrained from buying back any Berkshire shares for a fifth consecutive quarter.
The lack of spending contributed to its cash pile hitting yet another record, $358 billion, after subtracting Treasury payables.

8,2025-11-10,"Just $55 for the best Amazon Fire tablet on the market, the HD 8.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Cheap tablets can mostly be found year-round, though it doesn't hurt that Black Friday sales are approaching. As such, Amazon has chopped 45% off the Fire HD 8 tablet for its early Black Friday sale, meaning the discounted price point is set at just $55.
It's worth noting that the Fire HD 8 is our favorite Amazon tablet there is, featuring a perfectly mid-sized 8-inch IPS display, easy access to Alexa, and a wide range of streaming services and apps, as well as an improved design from previous generations. It's a great pick for use as a device with which to work on the go, as well as one used at home by the whole household as a smart home device control interface.
This particular deal is for the 32GB storage configuration and for the version of the tablet that features lockscreen ads. It is available for all three of the tablet's color options, including Black, Emerald, and Hibiscus. If you need more storage or you don't want lockscreen ads, you can pay more to upgrade, though it's also worth noting that it comes with a microSD port for expandable storage of up to 1TB.
Amazon Fire HD 8: $99.99 $54.99 for Amazon's early Black Friday sale
✅Recommended if: you're looking for an especially affordable tablet that still offers decent performance levels and user-friendliness; you like having a tablet with a screen of around 8 inches; you'd prefer a tablet that also comes with built-in speakers and a 3.5mm headphone jack.
❌Skip this deal if: you'd rather upgrade to a Fire tablet with a larger screen or premium-level performance; you have a budget to spend more than $55 and you would consider switching from the HD 8 to the HD 8 Plus; you'd prefer to go with a different brand than Amazon's in-house lineup.
In our opinion, the Fire HD 8 is one of the best cheap tablets around, especially due to its super low price tag (and even more so with this deal), its up to 13 hours of battery life, and its ease-of-use as an Alexa and smart home device. Like most tablets, you can also access a wide range of apps, including a number of music, TV, and movie streaming services, along with some games and other applications, still. We also think the size of the 8-inch display is perfect, falling between Amazon's HD 10 and the HD 7 Kids tablets.

9,2025-11-10,"Apple product retailer B&H is listing all HomePod mini models as discontinued, and no longer offering them for sale. Some other retailers are also listing the HomePod mini as out of stock or on backorder, which suggests that an update isn't too far off.
Adorama lists the ‌HomePod mini‌ as backordered, and select colors are out of stock at Target. Walmart doesn't have any stock that's not from resellers, Staples has no HomePod minis available online, and at least one color is sold out from Verizon. The Midnight color option is unavailable for shipping from Best Buy, though other colors are in stock. Apple is still selling all colors of the speaker, with options available for both immediate shipping and pick up.
Apple is rumored to be working on a new version of the ‌HomePod mini‌, and Bloomberg said it could come as soon as this month. It's possible that the waning stock at third-party retailers is a sign that we'll get a new version of the ‌HomePod mini‌ before the end of 2025.
Apple held an event in September and did a series of product releases in October, casting some doubt that a new model is still on the immediate horizon.
The next ‌HomePod mini‌ is expected to have an upgraded S-series chip inside and Apple's N1 networking chip, but there are no design changes rumored except for refreshed color options.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Patrick Montgomery, a former Army Ranger and the founder of KC Cattle Company, an American wagyu farm. It has been edited for length and clarity.
I thought I'd spend my whole life in Special Operations as part of the First Ranger Battalion — but when life had other plans and I left the Army in 2014, I certainly didn't expect to become a wagyu rancher.
I went back to school at the University of Missouri, planning to become a large-animal veterinarian. I loved the hands-on work, the adrenaline of working with farm animals, and a career where I could stay connected to the outdoors.
But when I started running the numbers for opening up my own clinic — six figures of student debt for a $60,000 salary — it just didn't add up. Around that time, I was also taking entrepreneurship classes. I found myself drawn just as much to balance sheets and business models as I was to anatomy charts, and began thinking of building something of my own.
In 2016, after a job interview left me feeling like I'd be selling my soul to a defense contractor, I called my wife and told her I was either going to start a company or return to the military. She didn't miss a beat and asked me what kind of company we'd be starting.
That's how KC Cattle Company was born — an idea rooted in my twin passions for animals and business, even though I had almost zero ranching experience.
I spent the next few years making what I called ""tuition payments at the school of hard knocks"" while I figured things out the hard way. I interned at vet clinics, worked on research farms, and learned from anyone who would let me tag along.
Eventually, I bought 420 acres of land about 45 minutes northwest of Kansas City and started raising a few dozen head of cattle. Now we run about 200 animals on the ranch, with partnerships across the country, many of them with fellow veterans.
At the time, I didn't know much about wagyu beyond that it was premium beef with an incredible marbling score. The Japanese use a grading scale from 1 to 12, where US ""prime"" beef barely hits a 4. Our average wagyu now ranks around 7, with some cuts scoring as high as 10. It's beef that genuinely melts in your mouth.
Wagyu cattle are expensive to buy, feed, and raise. They take longer to mature and yield less beef than other breeds. Still, I believed that if we were going to charge a premium, we had to produce the best beef in the country — and treat our animals right along the way.
A happy cow makes better beef. That's something you can see in the way they behave. When our cattle are lying down and chewing their cud, it's a sign they're content and healthy.
We don't use cattle prods or horses to move them — anything that adds stress hurts both the animal and the final product. Our approach isn't as rigid as Japan's, but it's far superior to most traditional American practices. The result is high-quality beef raised ethically, with respect for the animal and the environment.
By 2018, I'd shifted our focus from restaurant sales to e-commerce. I thought online retail might help us reach more customers, but we struggled to stand out — until one day, everything changed.
When ""Food & Wine"" named our wagyu hot dog the best in the world in 2019, we went from shipping 20 orders a week to 12,000 overnight. We were completely overwhelmed. The next day, I remember thinking, ""Okay, now we have to figure out how to keep up.""
Then the pandemic hit. When major meatpackers shut down and grocery store shelves emptied, our small operation suddenly became a lifeline for people looking to buy high-quality beef directly from the source. KC Cattle Company exploded in popularity, and for two years, business was booming.
When the pandemic subsided — and inflation hit — everything shifted again. Feed prices spiked. Fuel costs climbed. Consumers began to pull back on premium purchases.
For a while, it felt like we went from being a pandemic success story to fighting just to survive. But that's where my Ranger mindset kicked in: You don't quit — you adapt.
Out of that pressure came my second company, Valor Provisions. I realized America's food system was fragile, and small farmers were being squeezed by geography, logistics, and a lack of marketing power. Valor Provisions connects those producers — from veteran-owned pork farms to Montana cattle ranches — to customers nationwide at prices that compete with grocery stores. It's about building resilience in our domestic food supply.
When I started KC Cattle Company, wagyu beef felt like a niche market. It's now projected to surpass $3.5 billion by 2026. Demand for premium, traceable, and ethically raised beef is skyrocketing — and we're right in the middle of that surge.
We've also leaned into what KC Cattle Company does best: premium wagyu for special occasions, corporate gifts, and loyal customers who value the story behind their food.
Meanwhile, Valor Provisions is growing fast, helping American producers capture their share of this expanding market.
In the military, 1% of Americans serve to protect the other 99%. In agriculture, it's the same — about 1% of the population produces food for everyone else. That sense of service drives everything I do.
To me, food security is a matter of national security. If we can't feed our own people, everything else becomes irrelevant.
I never set out to become a rancher or run a wagyu company. But I did set out to build something that mattered: to support veterans, strengthen American agriculture, and prove that passion and perseverance can make up for inexperience.

Much of the American economy is currently being propped up (some may argue artificially) by the massive amount of investment being made into AI projects, largely by hyperscalers. Few firms have made a bigger public to-do about their AI spending than Meta, whose CEO very publicly committed to pouring billions of dollars into AI infrastructure in front of the President of the United States.
So why, of all of the “Magnificent 7” Big Tech stocks that seem to have achieved “line only goes up” status, has Metaâarguably the hyperest of the hyperscalersâseen most of its stock gains for the year wiped out in recent days?
At least part of the answer may lie in the company’s Superintelligence Lab, which has undergone expensive change after expensive change since Meta’s pseudo-acquisition of Scale AI in June. The $14 billion investment that brought Scale’s CEO, Alexandr Wang, under Meta’s umbrella was followed by the company handing out multi-million dollar contracts to bring in top talent. The company’s deals for the world’s best AI researchers reportedly included giving out $100 million per year paydays and multi-year commitments that would get recipients over a quarter of the way to billionaire status.
The plan seemed to be to get all the talent in-house and figure out the rest later. But the figuring it out part has yet to happen. The company launched its Superintelligence Lab, separate from its previous AI efforts, in June. In August, it broke its lab into four separate teams. In October, it cut around 600 people who were working in those teams, sparing its primary “superintelligence” effort while downsizing everything else AI-related. As all that was happening, some of Meta’s big hires were reportedly already looking for the door and were handed promotions to keep them in the fold rather than letting them walk.
And all ofÂ that happened seemingly in response to the fact that the latest version of the company’s large language model, Llama 4 Behemoth, was underperforming expectations and had its release delayed. It’s not Meta’s only AI product to underwhelm.
The company released Vibes, a feed filled with AI slop, before OpenAI’s massive Sora 2 app flooded the internet with AI-generated videos, but it’s yet to garner even a fraction of the hype. Last month, TechCrunch reported that Meta’s AI app hit 2.7 million daily active users after the introduction of Vibes, which is available in the Meta AI app. That’s not nothing, but the standalone Sora 2 app got more than one million downloads in less than a week, and ChatGPT has more than 800 million active weekly users, per OpenAI.
That performance would underwhelm for just about any consumer-facing app, but it’s particularly bad for a company that has massive reach and an install base like Meta. Its attempts to capitalize on its user base of several billion people have not been well-received. Shortly after the launch of the Meta AI app, it was revealed that user prompts were publicly visible to others. The company tried to show off its capabilities on Instagram by creating wholly fabricated profiles in what felt like an effort to seemingly trick people into engaging with AI. Investigations into Meta’s chatbot applications found that it would have sexually explicit conversations with minors, and in an effort to ramp up engagement, the company reportedly lowered guardrails around what its chatbots could say.
Despite all that, Meta’s engagement traps have yet to catch anywhere close to as many users as it would prefer. According to the latest edition of venture capital firm Andreesen Horowitz’s “Top 100 Gen AI Consumer Apps,” which came out in August, Meta AI barely cracked the top 50 of most used web apps, ranking 46th, and failed to make the top 50 for mobile apps.
There’s an irony to the fact that Meta is probably the company best equipped to monetize its AI projects, and it simply can’t seem to do it. OpenAI has basically zero infrastructure in place to cash in on its huge user base outside of selling subscriptions, and all of its ideas are just things Meta already dominates, like targeted advertising.
Unfortunately for Meta, it seems investors simply may not trust the company’s capabilities to crack the code and turn its AI tools into anything other than money-sucking black holes. The company has committed more than $600 billion into building out its AI infrastructure over the next few yearsâa promise seemingly made to please Donald Trumpâwhich has typically been viewed by the market as a positive indicator. But it doesn’t seem to have the benefit of the doubt that firms like OpenAI get when it comes to actually making those endeavors profitable.
That’s a bit of self-inflicted harm by Zuckerberg, who publicly said misspending billions isn’t a big deal. âIf we end up misspending a couple of hundred billion dollars, I think that that is going to be very unfortunate, obviously,â Zuckerberg said on the Access podcast. âBut what Iâd say is I actually think the risk is higher on the other side.” There’s also his history of going all in on projects that don’t pay off. The company went so all in on the idea of the “metaverse” that it changed its name, and yet it has reportedly lost nearly $100 billion chasing a virtual reality dream that was basically dead on arrival.
Meanwhile, the company’s money-making businesses are under scrutiny, too. Earlier this month, Reuters got hold of internal documents from the company that showed it projected as much as 10% of its revenue was coming from advertisements for scams and banned goods.
Monetizing scams probably wouldn’t be the worst business model in the world when it comes to AI, given the amount of bullshit it can generate at scale. But it’s also not exactly the thing that investors want to hear is a major source of revenue on earnings calls.

Marriott and Sonder have broken up, and guests are bearing the brunt of the fallout.
Hotel operator Marriott International signed a licensing agreement with short-term rental company Sonder in August 2024. On Sunday, Marriott announced that the agreement had been terminated due to ""Sonder's default."" The change canceled guests' current reservations and stopped future bookings.
On Monday, Sonder announced it was filing for bankruptcy and would liquidate its US business. The company also said it would ""initiate insolvency proceedings"" in other countries where it operates.
""We are devastated to reach a point where a liquidation is the only viable path forward,"" Janice Sears, Sonder's interim CEO, said in a press release, citing substantial delays in the Marriott partnership.
Marriott guests who had booked accommodations at Sonder properties said they were blindsided by Marriott's announcement on Sunday.
Tim Schaefer, a blogger from New York, told Business Insider he had booked two separate Sonder apartments in New York City for a total of 10 days. But he received cancellation emails from Sonder and Marriott about an hour before his check-in on Sunday.
He said he spoke with Marriott's help desk for an hour, asking for help booking another hotel for himself and his spouse at the same price, but was kept on hold.
""We have a high loyalty status — Platinum Elite — with them. We are not happy,"" Schaefer said.
David Klingbeil, an NYU course instructor who studies luxury and marketing, said that he was halfway through his two-week stay at Sonder Flatiron in New York when he received an email on Sunday afternoon telling him he had to vacate the hotel by 8 a.m. on Monday.
""I didn't believe it when I saw the email, I had to check that this wasn't a phishing attempt or something. Then I saw the articles and posts on X,"" Klingbeil told Business Insider.
Klingbeil said he had to book another hotel at a much higher price.
He said he was a Marriott Bonvoy Gold Elite member and had spent $15,000 with the hotel group this year.
""If I don't see a strong reaction from them, I believe I will never choose Marriott again,"" he said.
The company said online that customers who had booked a Sonder property through Marriott's channels would get a full refund. It added that customers with future reservations would receive an email about the ""potential to rebook at another Marriott Bonvoy property.""
Sonder's stock is down about 87% in the past year, to a $6.8 million market cap. Founded in 2014, the company went public in 2021 through a special-purpose acquisition company. The company had 9,400 live units in its portfolio as of March, according to its earnings report for the first quarter of 2025.
Representatives for Marriott and Sonder did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

Apple unveiled its latest Watch Series 11 in September this year, and while weâre not expecting discounts on the new version anytime soon, you can grab the previous generation model, which still packs a serious punch for less right now.
Currently, Amazon has the Apple Watch Series 10 (GPS, 42mm) with a Jet Black Aluminum Case and Black Sport Band going for $280, which is 30% off its original price. Several other color options are discounted too, but this Jet Black version is currently the lowest-priced one available. This watch covers all the essentials, and Apple also throws in three months of Apple Fitness+ to get you started on your journey. If youâve been holding out for a deal on an efficient Apple smartwatch, now is the time to make a move.
See at Amazon
The Series 10 comes with a 30% larger screen area compared to older models, but itâs also lighter and thinner, which makes it easy to wear the entire day. It measures all the ways you move with the Activity Rings, and lets you track a range of workouts while also providing advanced metrics. Those into water sports will appreciate the built-in depth and water temperature sensors, along with 50m water resistance. Take it to the pool or dive deep in the ocean without a worry.
Health-wise, you get access to the ECG app, Blood Oxygen monitoring, high and low heart rate alerts, and Cycle Tracking with ovulation estimates. It can even monitor how well you rest at night, as well as detect sleep apnea with the Vitals app. Youâll also enjoy key safety features like Fall Detection, Crash Detection, and Emergency SOS, which can be a lifesaver in unfortunate circumstances.
When you have it connected to your phone, you wonât need to pull your iPhone out to check notifications, control music, or take calls. The watch lets you do all of that and more right from your wrist. Even better, you can unlock your MacBook, plus get directions to your iPhone with Precision Finding if it ever gets misplaced.
Battery life is just as strong, and you can expect the watch to hit 80% in just 30 minutes when itâs running low. On most days, the Apple Watch Series 10 would set you back about $400, but this deal knocks a solid chunk off the price. You can treat yourself to one for less than $300 if you act fast.

A senior researcher from China's AI firm DeepSeek made a rare public appearance on Friday, where he warned about the technology's long-term risks.
AI could eliminate most jobs in the next 10 to 20 years, said Chen Deli during a panel discussion at the World Internet Conference in Wuzhen.
""During this period, societal structures will also be greatly challenged,"" he said.
""Tech companies should play the role of guardians of humanity, at the very least, protecting human safety, then helping to reshape societal order,"" he added.
DeepSeek has kept a low profile since making headlines earlier this year. The CEO of the Hangzhou-based startup, Liang Wenfeng, has not appeared in public since a televised meeting with China's leader Xi Jinping in February.
On Friday, Chen shared the stage with executives from five other companies collectively known as China's ""six little dragons"" of AI — a group that includes Alibaba Cloud and Unitree.
Chen said the short-term impact of AI would likely be positive. He dubbed this the ""honeymoon phase,"" when AI cannot independently complete tasks, and people can use AI to boost their productivity.
But over time, the risks could outweigh the rewards. Chen predicted that in the next five to 10 years, AI systems will become increasingly capable, and the workforce as a whole will have to contend with job cuts.
""During this period, tech companies should serve as whistleblowers, warning society of potential risks,"" he said.
Since its breakout earlier this year, DeepSeek has become a symbol of China's technological ambitions and a point of national pride amid intensifying US-China tensions over the AI race.
Founded in 2023, DeepSeek jolted the AI industry and the US stock market with its low-cost reasoning model, R1, unveiled in January. The company said its R1 model can match top competitors, such as ChatGPT's o1, at a fraction of the cost.
OpenAI wrote in a letter to the US government in March that while America still leads in AI, ""DeepSeek shows that our lead is not wide and is narrowing.""
In August, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman unveiled GPT-oss, a family of large language models with ""open weights."" Analysts told Business Insider in an August report that the move was likely influenced by the growing success of open-sourced Chinese models, including those from DeepSeek.
Ray Wang, the research director for semiconductors and emerging technology at Futurum Group, told Business Insider in August that OpenAI's GPT-oss models ""narrowed the gap"" with China, citing their ""competitive performance benchmarks and sizes against their Chinese counterparts.""
If the US fails to keep pace in open-source AI, Chinese models could garner more traction and become the default foundation for applications and research globally, Wang said.

AI might soon pop up at a grocery store near you — specifically, in your shopping cart.
Instacart is aiming to roll out Cart Assistant, an AI agent that can help shoppers make decisions about what to buy when they start shopping, Instacart CEO Chris Rogers said during the company's earnings call on Monday. Instacart is adding the AI tool to the websites it runs for retailers, as well as some of its Caper smart shopping carts.
Sprouts Farmers Market plans to add the tech to Caper carts at its stores, Instacart said last week. The delivery service has been expanding the use of its smart carts since acquiring Caper AI, the company that manufactures them, in 2021. The carts automatically scan items as customers place them in the cart and contain screens that allow users to keep a tally of their spending, pull coupons, and pay for their purchases.
Agentic AI is set to join that list of functions, Rogers said. Imagine going to the store to buy food for a party with 10 people, for instance, and asking Cart Assistant what to buy within your budget, Rogers said during the company's third-quarter earnings call on Monday.
The AI agent could also assist customers mid-shop, including by making sure that nothing a customer has selected contains an unwanted ingredient, he said.
""At the end of the shop, you could say, 'Check my entire basket for any gluten,'"" Rogers said on the call.
Cart Assistant is one of the AI-based services that Instacart said last week it plans to offer to retailers. Others include using AI to track which items are out of stock at a store or analyzing product data to make better shopping suggestions for customers.
While Instacart continues to build its delivery service, which relies on gig-worker shoppers to buy items at stores and deliver them to customers, it's also expanding its business-to-business operations by selling technology to grocery stores.
Since its founding in 2012, Instacart has accumulated data at many different retailers about what people buy — exactly the kind of information that can be useful for training AI models, Rogers said.
""We have incredible data from our $1.5 billion orders to date,"" Rogers said. ""We have a rich catalog of 17 million unique items. We understand people's preferences.""
Other retailers are also figuring out how AI might change the shopping experience.
Last month, Walmart and OpenAI struck a partnership that aims to enable users to order items from the big-box retailer directly through ChatGPT.

to sell its chatbot as a life coach for everyone.
Just fuck off already
Back in my day we called 'em shills.
Time to update yourself: now they're called Influenza`s.
 
... push a message to young consumers that might be summed up as: Our AI assistant is as cool as ChatGPT
Given that Microsoft isn't cool at all, and has no clue what 'cool' even is, I think it's gonna be a long uphill slog to failure. I don't think even the most popular influencers are capable of selling folks on the concept of anything Microsoft being even cool-adjacent.
Given that Microsoft isn't cool at all, and has no clue what 'cool' even is, I think it's gonna be a long uphill slog to failure. This, exactly.The most immediate thing about being cool is that nothing that is forced, is cool. Copilot existing, with some cool demos and higher thresholds on the free version, could possibly gain some opt-in usage. Copilot being forced everywhere means that people are going to associate it with something intrusive, and no amount of marketing is going to undo that.ChatGPT didn't force anything onto people's desktops or into their spreadsheets, they didn't run TV commercials and they didn't give sponsorships to 101 Youtube personalities...they existed, and they improved the service, and word-of-mouth was all they needed.If Microsoft wants their level of adoption, they need to stop pushing...but the problem is that nobody will accept a slow ascent, so they need the accidental, unwanted usage to show the 'growth' being demanded by the MBAs.One day they'll figure it out...probably the day after they have a fire sale on nVidia GPUs that have sat dormant for months.

I strongly agree. Copilot might be fantastic, but I'm not even willing to give it a chance because they keep on trying to foist it upon me. Unless someone tells me that using it cures cancer, I'd rather use one of the many alternatives.
This feels like MS trying to force people to use IE all over again.
People want helpful AI that doesn't hallucinate, code crap code, tell you to eat glue or commit suicide.
Copilot bogs a pc down as it spies on your work looking for opportunity to be a Clippy or Microsoft Bob.
Cool as warm ice cream.
""it has struggled to crack the consumer market"" - No kidding? Perhaps it's the fact that Microsoft views its consumers as money bags to be squeezed. Or perhaps the anti-consumer bullshit baked into Windows. Resorting to astroturfing to push useless crap is right up Microsoft's alley. People caught on years ago that Microsoft offerings generally suck. I'm skeptical that 150 million use this crap monthly. Probably due to default installs and what-not.
Given that Copilot uses ChatGPT tech and then has additional features from MS folks should try it rather than immediately discount it.I try all the LLMs and each has their pro and cons. Copilot actually is quite good and given its price (for now) is free, no reason to not use it if it works for the specific task youre working on.
Built into the latest Visual Studio.
If you have a good product, people will use it.  If you have a shit product, then having a Matt Damon peddle it will only expose how shitty it is to even more people.
If you have a good product, organic growth will happen and you'll create brand loyalty.
Oh wait... This is Microsoft.  Never mind.

In a tough market, applying to jobs can bring an instant sense of relief.
The problem is, it often doesn't bring much else.
Rather than applying to job after job, you'd be better off having five conversations a week with people at companies where you might want to work. That's the advice of Alan Stein, CEO of Kadima Careers, which offers job seekers coaching on how to get six-figure roles.
Following his ""five chats"" rule doesn't mean asking each person for a job, he told Business Insider.
""Go in there with an intent to learn about them,"" he said.
The conversations a week are a way of ""leveraging your relationships"" and building others, Stein said.
Maintaining and adding to your network is important because it can be hard to stand out in a sluggish labor market. Someone on the inside might be able to put in a good word for you with a recruiter or hiring manager — or even just let you know when a posting might be about to open up.
That matters because it's often better to make contact with key players before a job gets posted. And when a role does appear, applying early can sometimes give you a better shot at landing an interview.
Any edge can help in a market where it's hard to draw notice simply by applying.
Aaron Cleavinger, a managing partner at Murdoch Mason Executive Search Group, said that job seekers he speaks to often devote 80% to 90% of their time to applying for jobs. Yet, he estimates that those efforts only result in an interview about 3% of the time.
That's why he encourages people to rejigger how they divvy up their days.
""If your return is 3%, then spend 3% of your time applying to jobs,"" Cleavinger said.
Having conversations each week isn't just important when you're in the job market. If you're still employed — maybe you're hugging your job — there's less pressure, and building ties can be a lighter lift.
""The time to start networking is when you don't need something from someone else,"" Cleavinger said.
If you have a job, having one or two conversations a week with people about their work can be invaluable in cultivating relationships, he told Business Insider.
Cleavinger said it's best when networking is rooted in ""genuine curiosity"" about people with whom you have real relationships. It might be people you've worked with, though it's not limited solely to former coworkers. Your network might include vendors or consultants you've worked with. It can also just be people you know, but who are willing to give you the time.
""You talk to the people who are your champions and who love you, and then ask them who else they'd recommend,"" Cleavinger said.
If you're reaching out to someone you know, set something up by saying something like, ""I'd love to just catch up,"" he said.
Viewing the conversation this way, Cleavinger said, can also prevent you from feeling like you need to slip in a ham-handed job ask at the end of a call. There's also no need to request that the person let you know if they hear anything about a role.
""If they have a positive view of you after the conversation, they're going to think of you anyway,"" he said.
Cleavinger said that instead of asking for a job, inquire about other people you should connect with who might be willing to have similar conversations.
""It's expanding the size of your listening audience, because recency is going to remind them that you're amazing,"" he said.
Stein, who previously worked in Big Tech at firms including Facebook, Google, and Salesforce, said he recently followed his own guidance on networking by meeting with a high-level executive in Silicon Valley.
Stein said conversations like these are a chance to build a genuine connection. The exec ended up giving him some ""fantastic advice,"" including guidance on how Stein could use his experience in tech to differentiate his company's offerings.
Another perk of networking? Human-to-human interactions are also often far more enjoyable than submitting applications.
""It's more fruitful,"" he said. ""And you make a friend or two sometimes.""

By John Power

Stocks from the United States to Japan have risen sharply amid hopes that an end to the longest US government shutdown in history is imminent.
US lawmakers on Sunday moved to end a five-week impasse over government funding, a boost for investors unnerved by signs of growing weakness in the US economy and the sky-high evaluations of firms involved in artificial intelligence.
After a group of centrist Democrats broke with party leaders to join Republicans, the US Senate voted 60-40 to advance a bill that would fund government operations through the end of January.
The funding package still needs to win final approval in the Senate and then pass the US House of Representatives, after which it would go to US President Donald Trump for his signature – a process expected to take days.
Stock markets in the Asia Pacific made large gains on Monday, while futures in the US also rose in advance of stock exchanges reopening.
South Korea’s benchmark KOSPI led the gains, rising about 3 percent as of 4pm local time (07:00 GMT).
Japan’s Nikkei 225 and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng also rose sharply, advancing about 1.3 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively.
Taiwan’s Taiex rose about 0.8 percent, while Australia’s ASX 200 gained about 0.75 percent.
Futures for the US’s benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq-100, which are traded outside of regular market hours, were up about 0.75 and 1.3 percent, respectively.
The reprieve comes as investors are concerned that AI-linked stocks may be wildly overvalued and that Trump’s sweeping tariffs could be doing more damage to the US economy than has been captured in headline data so far.
Nvidia, whose graphics processing units are integral to the development of AI, last month became the first company in history to reach a market valuation of $5 trillion, a day after tech giant Apple surpassed $4 trillion in market value.
While the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ official jobs report has been suspended since August due to the government shutdown, several other analyses have pointed to a rise in layoffs in October.
Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an executive outplacement firm, said in a report last week that layoffs surged 183 percent last month, making it the worst October for jobs since 2003.
A separate analysis by Revelio Labs, a workforce analytics company, estimated that the economy shed 9,100 jobs during the month.

38,2025-11-10,"If you’re in the market for a HomePod mini, it may pay off to hold on for just a little longer, as a refresh looks increasingly imminent. Here’s why.
For the past few months, there’s been no shortage of rumors about an upcoming HomePod mini refresh. Still, the original HomePod mini lingers on.
However, as spotted by MacRumors, B&H, one of Apple’s major retail partners in the professional audio and video gear market, now lists the HomePod mini as discontinued.
In addition to B&H’s “discontinued” listing, multiple colors of the HomePod mini are currently unavailable at several major retailers, including Target and Walmart. Even in Apple Stores, pickup options are very limited, with multiple colors available only at flagship locations.
The current HomePod mini, which is actually the original HomePod mini, was released in 2020, with new colors joining the lineup in 2021, with no internal hardware changes or upgrades.
Since then, there have been multiple rumors about updates, with Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reporting the following as recently as last September:
“Apple’s other current smart home accessory — its smart speaker — is set to get a new chip to also support the new Siri and Apple Intelligence features. It’s also due to get an updated wireless chip, a new ultra-wide band chip and improved audio quality. Apple has also tested new colors, including red.”
Gurman also reported recently that Apple was gearing up for an Apple Store refresh on Wednesday, November 12, which could be related to the holiday season.
However, with the increasingly constrained inventory and now B&H flat-out listing it as discontinued, you might do well to wait just a bit longer in case you’re in the market for a new HomePod mini.
Do you think the HomePod mini will get an update in the coming days? Let us know in the comments.

The internet is awash in skepticism about the supposed looming oil glut as commentators note that, despite the IEA’s implied inventory build of 800 million barrels this year and 1200 million barrels next year, most of that has not shown up in the data. The figure below shows the implied inventory build calculated using the IEA’s global supply minus global demand and assuming OPEC production remains constant from June 2025 to end 2026. The implication is of a massive glut and inventory build, already putting pressure on prices. 
Source:  Supply minus demand from IEA Oil Market Report; OPEC production assumed flat from June 2025.
Responses to this have included trashing the IEA as either incompetent or dishonest and some are also arguing that the failure of inventories to grow implies a much tighter market now and in the coming months than the IEA is forecasting. Certainly, the IEA has often underestimated demand outside of the IEA member countries, where data ranges from lagged to poor; if that is the case now, the market balance is much less threatening that projected. 
Some of the criticisms are off-base. The IEA’s forecasts are biased in the sense that they are produced by humans and humans are biased. The same can be true of market reports from both the EIA and OPEC and the punditosphere. And while there might be institutional biases, these are not straightforward: the IEA has often warned of coming price spikes, yet now we have the IEA forecast implying an exceptionally weak market, as if their bias was somehow reversed. 
Without doubt, inventories are not behaving as they should. The figure below shows inventory changes compared to the implied balance (which is supply minus demand). The numbers for 2024 appear reasonably well matched, with the inventory changes close to what would be expected. That changes this year, when there should have been an enormous inventory build, about 500 million barrels of 1.5 mb/d in the first half, versus ‘observed’ inventory builds of only 0.5 mb/d. 
Source: IEA Oil Market Report; Industry and government stocks for OECD countries. 
So where’s the missing oil?  Inventories outside the IEA countries are not included in the data above and, given that half of oil consumption is outside the OECD, it would be expected that inventory builds in the OECD, shown in the figure above, would only be about half of the total. More important, the IEA reports that from April to August this year, Chinese inventories grew by 110 million barrels, or over 700 tb/d. (The EIA estimated the number at 900 tb/d from January to August. Expanding strategic oil stocks in China support crude oil prices - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) This easily explains the discrepancy without needing to assume demand is 1 mb/d underestimated. It might be, but then the inventory picture would look much tighter than the current data shows.
In terms of the market going forward, then, the level of confidence in the IEA’s projected market balance should be that much greater. And even if demand estimates are off by 1 mb/d or so, the market surplus still looks to be over 2 mb/d for 2026. If one assumed that half of that oil went into OECD inventories, as shown in the figure below, then it is hard to avoid expectations that the market will be under significant pressure in the months ahead. 
Data from IEA. Forecast from July 2025 based on assumption that half of difference between supply and demand in IEA forecast goes into OECD commercial inventories. 
The nature of this year’s inventory build, apparently heavily concentrated in Chinese government inventories, is important because behavior varies enormously between government and commercial inventory holders. Commercial inventory holders will sometimes increase their stocks if they expect prices to go up and sell them off if they think future prices will be lower, which exacerbates the price cycle. For their part, government inventory holders tend to buy and hold as a hedge against future supply disruptions and without regard for market developments.
China’s government stock-buying has three potential motivations: their desired inventory levels are determined by imports which had been increasing; the possibility that Russian oil supplies will be affected by sanctions leads them to add to holdings as a hedge; and the possibility that the government fears some political dispute will lead to efforts to embargo their oil purchases. The last could reflect either Chinese government plans to take some aggressive actions that it fears will trigger an embargo or simply an assessment that U.S. policies are so unpredictable that an increased hedge against a possible embargo is needed. 
Chinese decision making regarding the desired level of oil stocks is obviously not transparent; changes are observed but with a lag, but what drives them to buy or not is unknown. Since we don’t know either precisely why the government has been adding to its strategic stocks or what  their target level is, the future purchases (or sales) cannot be predicted. The very real possibility that purchases might abruptly cease means the market balance could shift quickly and severely. 
If the global economy is strong over the coming year and sanctions against Iran, Russia and Venezuela are tightened, then the market balance could prove to be much tighter than the IEA projection. A surplus of 2 mb/d is quite possible as an annual average, but the first half could still see an inventory build around that amount even in a bullish price scenario. That wouldn’t be too difficult for markets to accommodate—assuming China continues to buy 1 mb/d for its strategic stocks. But cessation of those purchases by China would threaten to turn an inventory surge into a flood and OPEC+ will have to step in again to prevent a price collapse. "

Black Friday 2025NintendoSwitchSwitch 2 
I guess it’s that time of year again already. Nintendo just announced its sales for Black Friday 2025 and they are…not that impressive. Unsurprisingly, the Switch 2 remains full price. But there’s also no discounted Switch bundle in sight, and the slate of Switch games that are on sale for up to $30 off aren’t exactly the cream of the crop.
Let’s start with which deals the Nintendo Black Friday 2025 sale does include. First, Samsung MicroSD Express Cards for Switch 2 will be $20 off at select stores starting November 30. Second, a handful of Zelda and Street Fighter 6 amiibo will be $10 off. Finally, here are the Nintendo games that will be discounted starting November 23:
Most of these are either B-tier releases or came out quite a while ago. There’s no The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild or Tears of the Kingdom, and Mario Kart is MIA as well. Other retailers might run their own discounts on physical Nintendo games, but it seems pretty clear the company is treating much of its back catalog as functionally brand-new releases for potential new Switch 2 owners this holiday.
While Walmart, Target, and other retailers could still do their own deals, it’s disappointing that Nintendo seems to have retired the Switch bundles that it had been hauling out every Christmas for the last couple years. There’s no Mario Kart 8 Deluxe bundle for the OG Switch or Switch OLED, and no returning Switch Lite sale. Combined with the price increases over the summer, the older hardware will actually be more expensive this holiday than last.
The lack of any special Switch 2 deals from Nintendo isn’t surprising at all. In fact, the $500 Mario Kart World bundle the console launched with was essentially already that, giving you the hardware and game for $30 below the regular MSRP. I guess fans should just be thankful that Nintendo hasn’t raised the price of the Switch 2 yet and has plenty of stock for the end of 2025. The company said it doesn’t foresee any more price hikes in the immediate future, unless another unexpected trade war erupts.

The Samsung Galaxy S26 series might not be as delayed as previously thought. Moreover, a new leak has revealed that pricing for the Galaxy S26 series might be higher, along with some details about the chipset used in the flagship.
With the Galaxy S25 series almost a year behind us, leaks about the Galaxy S26 lineup are starting to pick up pace. We learned earlier that late in the Galaxy S26 development cycle, Samsung replaced the Galaxy S26 Edge with the Galaxy S26 Plus, leading to rumored delays. However, a new leak now suggests the Galaxy S26 series might not be as delayed as expected.
Korean outlet ChosunBiz (via @Jukanlosreve on X) reports that Samsung is targeting a late January launch for the Galaxy S26 series, with market availability by mid-February. According to the report, Samsung has resolved the delay caused by the lineup reorganization and is once again planning a launch in the first month of 2026.
A source close to the publication revealed that as the ""hardware verification period lengthened"" due to the Edge-to-Plus replacement, ""the launch was almost delayed, but this issue has been resolved, making a February launch possible.""
 



The report also notes that Samsung might again use a mix of Exynos and Qualcomm chipsets for the Galaxy S26 series. The Galaxy S26 Ultra will reportedly use the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chipset worldwide, while the Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus will feature the Exynos 2600 in most regions.
This, however, might mean that the Galaxy S26 Ultra will cost slightly more than the Galaxy S25 Ultra. A recent report indicated that pricing for the Galaxy S26 lineup could rise due to higher costs of internal components like SoC and RAM chips. Today's leak adds further weight to the claim, adding that if the S26 Ultra exclusively uses the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 worldwide, a ""price increase will be inevitable.""
Another noteworthy detail about the Galaxy S26 Ultra (via @UniverseIce on X) is that its front-facing camera might increase in size. The leaker says this will be the ""biggest hole ever used on any Ultra model"" to date, though the reason isn't yet known. It's unclear if this is due to a larger sensor, but it appears the selfie camera will be slightly bigger than usual on the Galaxy S26 Ultra.

That said, not all is set in stone yet, as the Galaxy S26 series is still a few months away. A lot could change before its launch next year, though we're finally starting to see how the lineup might take shape.

Your everyday laptop should be powerful enough to handle your multitasking needs during the day and support some light gaming or streaming at night. Basically, it should be a machine that doesnât slow you down.
Most mid-range laptops on the market range from $1,000 to $1,500, and thatâs without many premium features. But thatâs not the case today. Thanks to Amazonâs early Black Friday deals, you can snag the 16-inch Lenovo ThinkPad E16 Gen 3 for just $850, after a steep 67% off its original list price. Itâs also a top-rated pick on Amazon, but since thereâs no telling how long the discount will last, you might want to hurry to grab it. Big discounts like this donât usually stick around long, so itâs worth jumping on while it lasts.

 Pokemon TCG: Mega Charizard X ex Ultra-Premium Collection 
 $211.41 (was $250) | Releases November 14 
 
Amazon has restocked preorders for the Pokemon Trading Card Game's new Charizard-themed Ultra-Premium Collection. Part of this week's Mega Evolution: Phantasmal Flames launch lineup, Mega Charizard X ex Ultra-Premium Collection is available to preorder for $211.41 (was $250) at Amazon. The collection has sold out and popped back up multiple times over the past few days--it sold out and then came back while I was writing this--so if the listing says $300, we'd highly recommend checking again soon.
Amazon is also taking preorders for the Phantasmal Flames Elite Trainer Box and the new Mega Battle Deck. All three Pokemon TCG products launch this Friday, November 14.
The Mega Charizard-themed Ultra-Premium Collection comes with multiple promo cards, 18 Booster Packs, and a bunch of accessories, including a stylish Charizard X ex playmat and deck box. Here's the full list of what's in the box:
The 18 Booster Packs are from a mix of expansion sets, including Phantasmal Flames, Mega Evolution, Destined Rivals, Journey Together, and more.

In addition to this week's launches, Pokemon Trading Card Game collectors can secure last week's big release from Amazon. The new Pokemon TCG Mega Lucario ex Figure Collection in stock for $49.69 (was $70). The Mega Evolution-themed Lucario box set launched November 7. It comes with a Lucario figure with a built-in terrain display stand, two Mega Lucario ex promo cards, and five booster packs.

Mega Evolution - Phantasmal Flames launches this Friday, November 14. Like most Pokemon TCG releases this year, Phantasmal Flames is proving difficult to find in stock ahead of launch. As usual, prices are all over the place, too. At the time of writing, only three products from the lineup were in stock: the Mega Charizard X ex Ultra-Premium Collection, Elite Trainer Box, and Mega Battle Deck. Amazon had the Phantasmal Flames Booster Display Box in stock November 9.
If you preorder the Mega Battle Deck from Amazon, you'll get a Gengar ex or Diancie ex 60-card deck as well as a playmat, deck box, strategy sheet, damage counters, and a metallic coin.
Nearly all of the Phantasmal Flames products in the list below release this Friday. The only exception is the Build & Battle Box, which launches December 5.

 $80 (was $100)

It's worth noting Amazon also has multiple products from the Mega Evolution base set right now. The prices have dropped recently, too. The Mega Evolution Elite Trainer Box was selling for around $100 a few weeks ago, but now it's available for $80. You can get the Booster Bundle with six card packs for $55--five bucks lower than Amazon's price last month. Amazon also has the Booster Blister 3-Pack for $29.89. The Mega Latias ex Box was in stock recently for $41, but now it's only available via resellers.
If you're looking for more Pokemon Trading Card Game products ahead of the holidays, the list below collects all of the in-stock items at Amazon. We only included products that are sold and shipped by Amazon, and we excluded the Mega Evolution and Phantasmal Flames products mentioned above. Notable in-stock bundles and collections include the Pokemon TCG Holiday Calendar 2025 for $73 and Pokemon Battle Academy 2024 for $13.69. The popular Infernape V Box is back in stock for $65 after being sold out for months.
One notable omission from the list is Blaziken ex & Volcanion ex Premium Collection, Amazon's Holiday 2025 exclusive. It was restocked on October 19 but quickly sold out, and we haven't seen it return. You can, however, purchase Amazon's Holiday 2024 Paradox Fury Premium Collection. It ships from Amazon's UK warehouses for free.

57,2025-11-10,"The woman shared on Reddit that she feels guilty for not trusting him 
Getty
 A woman discovered that her boyfriend had a secret phone — but he wasn't using it for what she thought.

 Now, the 28-year-old turned to Reddit for advice about how to handle the situation, as she feels guilty for snooping. In her post, she explained that her boyfriend turned his photo off every night before bed, which she found odd.

 ""No texts, no notifications, just total silence. I joked about him having a burner for cheating, and he laughed it off, until one night he forgot to lock his car,"" she wrote. ""I opened the glove compartment and found a second phone, but it wasn’t for what I thought.""

 The woman said the phone was filled with photos of his late dad, who had died two years prior. It also contained voice recordings and messages that her boyfriend wrote but never sent.

Getty
 ""He told me he uses it to 'talk' to him when he feels lost, like he’s still there. I don’t know why, but it broke me,"" she wrote. ""All this time I thought I was losing him to someone else, but he was just trying not to lose his father.""

 ""Now I feel guilty for ever doubting him, and somehow even more in love,"" she ended.

 The comments in the post were split between those who wanted to show care to the boyfriend and those who were skeptical of the woman's behavior.

 ""That’s so heartbreaking and touching. I hope this lets you work with him to open up about his loss,"" one person wrote.

 ""That’s some real emotional depth right there. Like, men who process grief like that?? Rare species. protect him at all costs,"" another person wrote.

 Still, people in the comments were disappointed that the woman broke his trust by going through his things.

 ""Everyone’s talking about how adorable the guy is and simultaneously, completely ignoring the absolute toxic behavior from you. Is going through your partner’s car and phone (because of nothing more than your own insecurities) while they sleep really acceptable?"" one person questioned.

 ""He's good, you're the problem and should seek help for your trust issues,"" another person put bluntly.

58,2025-11-10,"Questions abound about who qualifies and whether enough funds are available.
President Donald Trump over the weekend vowed to provide each American a $2,000 dividend to be distributed from what he said was tariff revenue.
""A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone,” the president wrote on social media Sunday, in part.
Within hours, however, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent cast doubt on the plan, saying the payout could merely refer to tax savings enshrined by Trump's signature domestic spending measure.
A tariff dividend may come ""in lots of forms,"" Bessent told ABC News' ""This Week"" on Sunday, adding that he had not spoken with Trump about the proposal.
The idea of a potential tariff dividend -- reminiscent of pandemic-era stimulus checks -- has raised questions about who would qualify and what to make of the Trump administration’s mixed signals about the proposal. Some economists questioned whether the dividend is achievable with available tariff funds.
Here's what to know about the proposed $2,000 tariff dividends.
What is a dividend?
The term ""dividend"" typically describes a payout to individual shareholders, funded by a company's profits.
In this case, the concept functions in a similar fashion, indicating payouts to Americans that are funded by tax raised by Trump's far-reaching tariffs.
The proposal mirrors the three stimulus checks mailed to Americans during the pandemic, two of which were authorized by Trump. Those three payments totaled as much as $3,200 per tax filer, as well as $2,500 per child, according to the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, a watchdog established by Congress.
What did Trump say about a potential $2,000 tariff dividend?
Trump announced the policy proposal in a brief message on social media on Sunday morning, focused on tariff-related tax revenue.
""People that are against Tariffs are FOOLS! We are now the Richest, Most Respected Country In the World, With Almost No Inflation, and A Record Stock Market Price. 401k's are Highest EVER,"" the president wrote. ""A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone.""
The message did not specify who would qualify for the payout or how the policy would operate.
Who would qualify for the $2,000 dividend?
It is not clear who would qualify for the payout, though Trump said the measure would exclude ""high income people.""
The pandemic-era stimulus checks enacted by Trump were made available to individuals bringing in as much as $75,000 per year and couples earning up to $150,000. Beyond those benchmarks, higher earners were eligible for smaller payments.
Last year, median U.S. household income was $83,730, the Census Bureau found.
Did Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent cast doubt on the dividend checks?
Hours after Trump's announcement, Bessent appeared to throw cold water on the likelihood of tariff-related dividend checks.
On Sunday, Bessent suggested the $2,000 savings may instead be rooted in tax cuts previously enshrined by Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill legislation, which he signed into law on July 4.
""It could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president's agenda. No tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, deductibility on auto loans. Those are substantial deductions that are being financed in the tax bill,"" Bessent told ABC News' ""This Week"" Sunday.
""The real goal of tariffs is to rebalance trade and make it more fair,"" Bessent added.
The dueling remarks from Trump and Bessent come days after the Supreme Court heard arguments about whether a president has the constitutional authority to unilaterally levy tariffs. Arguing on behalf of the Trump administration, Solicitor General John Sauer downplayed the revenue-raising component of the policy, saying the tariffs do not encroach upon the taxing power afforded to Congress under the Constitution.
""The fact that [the tariffs] raise revenue is only incidental,"" Sauer told the justices.
Has the U.S. raised enough tariff revenue to fund $2,000 checks?
If Trump were to make the dividend payments available to anyone earning $100,000 or less, the policy would reach about 150 million Americans, amounting to roughly $300 billion in dividends, Erica York, a policy expert at the Tax Foundation, said in a post on X.
As of Sept. 30, the federal government had generated $195 billion in tariff-related revenue, according to the Treasury Department.
By that math, the estimated $300 billion cost of the dividend check proposal would far exceed the amount of currently available tariff revenue.
When factoring in only revenue generated by Trump's new levies and deducting some negative budgetary impact from those policies, York estimated net tariff revenues of only $90 billion, falling even shorter of the $300 billion required.
Moreover, depending on how the Supreme Court may rule regarding Trump's legal authority to levy tariffs, the White House may be forced to return tens of billions of dollars in revenue to importers who paid the tax, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found.
In theory, however, the Trump administration could promise to pay the dividend from anticipated tariff revenue. The Treasury Department has forecast $3 trillion in tariff revenue over the next decade. Should the Trump administration choose that route, the dividend payments would add to the federal debt, which currently stands at over $38 trillion, according to the Treasury Department.

Join and Mending are both woven polyester upholstery fabrics that feature soft, natural colours and patterns designed to reflect the imperfect charm of human handiwork.
Mending is inspired by the act of stitching, combining a subtle grid pattern with patch-like shapes, while Join features soft-edged offset stripes, creating a look that is rhythmic and balanced but subdued.
""As designers, we have been huge fans of Nanimarquina [but] their dedication to craftsmanship and celebration of material is perhaps not always paramount in commercial materials,"" said Designtex VP of Design Catherine Stowell.
""This collaboration gave us the challenge of being able to translate those high-level craft cues into Join and Mending.""
She explained that her team had worked to capture Nanimarquina's material sensibility by using performance yarns and embedding imperfections into the weaving process.
""The word that defines this collection for me is 'sincero', not just sincere, but deeply honest,"" added Nanimarquina founder Nani Marquina. ""You can feel that in the materials, the process, and the intention.""

YouTube TV is offering subscribers a rebate as its fight with Disney drags on — with a few caveats.
The Google-owned TV service said Sunday that it's offering customers a $20 bill credit, partially reimbursing them for the sports and shows they've missed on Disney's networks, like ESPN, in the last 11 days. This rebate takes off about a quarter of YouTube TV's $83 a month price tag.
""We know it's been disappointing to lose Disney content, and we want you to know we deeply appreciate your patience,"" YouTube TV said in an email to subscribers about the $20 bill credit. YouTube added that it's ""been working in good faith"" to reach a fair deal with Disney, which has argued that the tech giant is using its market power to drive down the rate it's paying.
There are two key catches with YouTube TV's rebate: it's not automatically applied, and the opt-in bill credit counts toward a customer's next month, not this month.
To receive the partial refund, YouTube TV customers must click this link, which directs them to the updates tab on the YouTube TV website or app. Subscribers can then click a blue button that says ""claim credit"" to get the $20 rebate applied to their next billing month.
A Google spokesperson said that YouTube TV subscribers will receive the rebate link via email in the coming days. While this is a simple two-step process that takes less than 30 seconds, it's still more effort than an automatic credit. (If subscribers are billed through a third-party service like Google Play, the credit will be applied automatically, YouTube TV's website says.)
The other caveat is that this $20 bill credit applies to a YouTube TV subscriber's next month, instead of their current statement. That means customers must stick around for another month to get the rebate — and that those who've already left the service won't be partially refunded.
""You must have an active YouTube TV Base subscription to be eligible for this credit,"" YouTube TV's website says. That means those whose subscriptions are paused or canceled must unpause or uncancel them to receive this bill credit.
This rebate comes in part from the money that YouTube and Google are saving while they're not paying Disney for access to its channels. And by making most current subscribers opt in to the bill credit, YouTube will avoid paying out the rebate to subscribers who missed the memo.
Now that YouTube TV subscribers have received the credit, the next big question is when the stalemate with Disney ends. A look at past carriage disputes suggests it could linger for at least a few more days, if ""Monday Night Football"" isn't enough of a catalyst to get a deal done.

The world's top YouTuber, MrBeast, is beefing up his team, adding four new executives since September to drive up brand deals, recruit more creatives, and expand his production work.
Among the new hires are:
Wieseneck is joining Beast Industries from the Snapchat-maker Snap, where he worked on creator business deals. Calabrese previously headed up media and entertainment sales at TikTok.
The march of new hires with big media pedigrees reflects the MrBeast team's ambition to build a Disney-style entertainment colossus. The company, which raised money earlier this year at a $5 billion valuation, has been pushing to turn its media properties profitable. Staffing up in areas like brand partnerships could help it hit its goals more quickly.
Luring professionals away from traditional media and tech has likely become easier as the tech job market dips and some jobs in Hollywood disappear.
MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, is the most followed YouTuber, having transformed a single YouTube channel into a full-blown media empire with over 400 million subscribers, an Amazon Prime Video show, and about $224 million in 2024 media revenue, according to a leaked investor deck from early 2025 viewed by Business Insider.
The MrBeast team now operates in a variety of business lines outside media, including its chocolate brand Feastables. The company is also exploring other ventures like fintech, according to a recent US trademark filing and investor materials.
Many of MrBeast's roughly 450 employees work out of his headquarters in Greenville, North Carolina, though some, like staff at Feastables, work elsewhere. For some hires, Donaldson starts with a 90-day probationary period to screen for culture fit, known internally as a ""vibe check.""
Beast Industries CEO Jeffrey Housenbold, who joined the team last year, has been on a push this year to professionalize the company and cut down on spending.
""My goal is to make everything we do profitable,"" Housenbold told Business Insider in August. ""In the past, it was just about ideas and the quality of the content. I'm moving the organization to produce great content that is also on time and on budget.""
Kendal, Wieseneck, and Calabrese did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for MrBeast declined to comment.

Clues Emerge in the Mystery of Peru's ""Band of Holes""
Researchers from the University of Sydney have found new evidence that could finally explain one of the Andes' most puzzling archaeological sites. Monte Sierpe (translated as ""serpent mountain"" and often called the ""Band of Holes"") lies in Peru's Pisco Valley and features more than 5,000 carefully aligned circular depressions carved into the desert hills.
This unusual formation has fascinated and mystified both scientists and the public for decades.
Lead author Dr. Jacob Bongers, a digital archaeologist at the University of Sydney, asked, ""Why would ancient peoples make over 5,000 holes in the foothills of southern Peru? Were they gardens? Did they capture water? Did they have an agricultural function? We don't know why they are here, but we have produced some promising new data that yield important clues and support novel theories about the site's use.""
Using advanced drone technology, his team mapped the site and found numerical patterns in the layout that suggest deliberate design rather than random placement.
The researchers were astonished to discover that the layout of Monte Sierpe mirrors the structure of an Inca khipu (a knotted-string device used for recording information) found in the same valley.
""This is an extraordinary discovery that expands understandings about the origins and diversity of Indigenous accounting practices within and beyond the Andes,"" said Dr. Bongers.
Ancient Plants Reveal Trade and Transport Clues
Soil samples from the holes revealed traces of maize (corn), one of the Andes' most essential crops, along with reeds that were traditionally used for weaving baskets. These findings show that ancient people placed plant materials into the holes, possibly using woven containers for transport.
""This is very intriguing,"" Dr. Bongers said. ""Perhaps this was a pre-Inca marketplace, like a flea market. We know the pre-Hispanic population here was around 100,000 people. Perhaps mobile traders (seafaring merchants and llama caravans), specialists (farmers and fisherfolk), and others were coming together at the site to exchange local goods such as corn and cotton. Fundamentally, I view these holes as a type of social technology that brought people together, and later became a large-scale accounting system under the Inca Empire.
""There are still many more questions -- why is this monument only seen here and not all over the Andes? Was Monte Sierpe a sort of 'landscape khipu'? -- but we are getting closer to understanding this mysterious site. It is very exciting.""
The team's findings were published on November 10 in the journal Antiquity.
Stretching for about 1.5 kilometers across the Pisco Valley in southern Peru, Monte Sierpe consists of roughly 5,200 uniform holes, each 1-2 meters wide and 0.5-1 meter deep, arranged in rows and divided into distinct sections.
The site first gained widespread attention in 1933 when aerial photos appeared in National Geographic, but its true purpose has remained uncertain ever since.
""Hypotheses regarding Monte Sierpe's purpose range from defense, storage, and accounting to water collection, fog capture and gardening, yet the true function of the site remains unclear,"" said Dr. Bongers.
Drones and Soil Analysis Offer New Clues
To better understand this enigmatic feature of Peru's landscape, Dr. Bongers and an international research team combined drone-based aerial photography with microbotanical analysis of sediments collected from the holes. These complementary approaches revealed new details about how the site was organized and used, both at a fine scale and across the broader landscape.
Together, the data support a new interpretation of Monte Sierpe as an Indigenous center for barter and exchange that may have evolved into an accounting system under Inca rule.
Monte Sierpe's location adds weight to this idea. It sits between two Inca administrative centers and near a crossroads of pre-Hispanic roads. The area occupies a transitional ecological zone (chaupiyunga) between the Andes highlands and the lower coastal plain, an ideal meeting ground for trade between regions.
These findings suggest that the pre-Inca Chincha Kingdom may have built Monte Sierpe for organized barter and trading, and that the Inca later repurposed it for accounting and tribute collection.
""This research contributes an important Andean case study on how past communities modified landscapes to bring people together and promote interaction,"" said Dr. Bongers.
International Collaboration and Technological Innovation
Dr. Jacob Bongers specializes in drone-based archaeological mapping and is the Tom Austen Brown Postdoctoral Research Associate in Archaeology at the University of Sydney. He is also a core member of the Vere Gordon Childe Centre (VGCC), which unites experts across disciplines to study humanity through time. In addition, he is a Visiting Research Fellow at the Australian Museum Research Institute.
Professor Kirsten McKenzie, Director of the VGCC, praised his work: ""We are all hugely proud of his achievement. Monte Sierpe is a high-profile site that attracts a lot of popular commentary online, including misinformation that threatens to overshadow Indigenous knowledge bases and community ownership over history and heritage.
""Dr. Bongers' team brought to light an incredible example of Indigenous accounting and exchange through interdisciplinary research and diverse expertise, highlighting how cutting-edge technologies and analyses lead to a completely novel understanding of Andean communities in the past.""
Professor Charles Stanish, senior co-author from the University of South Florida, noted that despite its fame, Monte Sierpe had seen little professional archaeological study since its discovery in the 1930s and limited surveys in the 1970s. ""The site is isolated and not threatened by development. As a result, there has not been a sense of urgency,"" he explained.
That changed with the advent of drone imaging. ""With the recent availability of drone technology, archaeologists detected mathematical patterning in the layout of the holes. This is a spectacular find. Combined with discoveries in the Cañete Valley 75 kilometers north of Inca storage sites with precisely aligned products on the ground in carefully drawn squares, interest in the Band of Holes skyrocketed.""
Professor Stanish added that the site has long drawn public fascination, but reliable data was scarce. ""The site has always been very prominent in the pseudoarcheology world with rampant speculation and mischaracterization of the data on the ground. One of the benefits of scientific work is the debunking of unsubstantiated claims that in many ways deprive Indigenous peoples' rightful ownership of their past.""
Mapping the Andes' Hidden Patterns
Before drone surveys, it was nearly impossible to grasp the site's structure from ground level or even from nearby hills because of the persistent coastal haze. ""Until drone technology, the site of Monte Sierpe/Band of Holes was extremely difficult to map on the surface. One simply cannot get an accurate impression of the structured nature of the hole segments, even from the top of the mountain behind due to the permanent haze in the area,"" said Stanish.
He added, ""Furthermore, there were very few artifacts on the ground making it difficult to determine a date for the site. Once we had precision, low-altitude images it was immediately clear that this site was profoundly important and had to be scientifically studied.""
""Now that we have established that this site was for storage and redistribution, our University of South Florida team will conduct additional work to determine the range and origins of the various plants, particularly the medicinal ones,"" Professor Stanish said. ""With every identification of a new plant type, the Band of Holes becomes more intriguing.""
The research received support from a Franklin Research Grant, the University of South Florida Office of the Dean, and the Cotsen Institute of Archaeology at the University of California, Los Angeles. The team also thanked the Peruvian Ministry of Culture for its research permit (000318-2024-DCIA-DGPA-VMPCIC/MC). Open access funding was provided by the University of Sydney.

Tesla shares up 2.1% pre-market trading Monday after Cybertruck chief Siddhant Awasthi announced his departure, coming just days after shareholders approved Elon Musk’s record $1 trillion compensation package. 
Tesla opened up 2.35% Monday and climbed to 4.1% by 11:30 am after Cybertruck chief Siddhant Awasthi announced Sunday on X that he’s leaving the company.
Critics have slammed the Cybertruck as one of the auto industry’s biggest misfires, citing eight recalls in its first 13 months, poor build quality and a polarizing appearance.
Tesla sold 5,385 Cybertrucks in the third quarter, down 62.6% from 14,416 a year earlier, according to Cox Automotive.
Year to date, sales have dropped 38% to 16,097 vehicles from 25,974 a year ago, per the report.
The 6,600-pound truck sold fewer than 40,000 units in 2024, 84% less than Musk’s 250,000-unit goals.
When Musk unveiled the Cybertruck in 2019, he promised a revolutionary pickup that would upend the auto industry. Instead, the truck has become emblematic of Tesla’s growing troubles. The stainless-steel construction, intended to cut costs by eliminating the need for a costly paint shop,  proved both expensive and difficult to manufacture, leading to production delays and recurring panel defects, according to a person familiar with the development process who who spoke to Forbes. Industry analyst Glen Mercer estimates Tesla spent around $900 million developing the truck. At over 6,600 pounds the Cybertruck has found little traction outside the U.S., where its bulk and pedestrian-safety standards limit sales."

Coinbase has announced the upcoming launch of a new token sales platform that will allow U.S. retail investors to participate in initial coin offerings (ICOs) for the first time since the token sale hysteria of 2017 and 2018, which eventually ended in disaster for many crypto speculators. The move to launch this platform comes just a few weeks after Coinbase acquiredÂ the investment platform Echo for $375 million.
ICOs were all the rage in 2017, as the then-relatively-new blockchain platform Ethereum appeared to have found its first major use case. While there are a few projects from this era of crypto that are still around, the hysteria around ICOs eventually turned into marketing-focused teams collecting investment from others, with not much more to show for plans than a whitepaper (if that).
The large amount of outright fraud occurring in the space at the time led to a regulatory backlash from the Biden administration, and Kim Kardashian, Floyd Mayweather, and other celebrities were eventually charged with SEC violations regarding their promotion of dubious crypto tokens.
While the ICO market has been dormant in the United States since that time, there is now a push to bring back this type of activity under the crypto-friendly Trump administration via platforms like the new token offering facility provided by Coinbase.
Much of the fraud that was able to proliferate during the 2017 to 2018 ICO bubble came down to the lack of traditional investment standards being followed. To prevent that sort of environment from developing again, Coinbase says it will require projects to meet certain requirements to launch token sales and also use an algorithm to try to put newly-issued tokens in the hands of users who are in it for the long haul.
For example, the platform is intended to promote a wide distribution of the initial tokens and will punish token investors who tend to simply dump their allocations on the market as quickly as possible. Additionally, token issuers will be blocked from selling their allocations for at least six months, and the teams behind the projects will need to follow a disclosure policy regarding tokenomics and other attributes of the project related to credibility and trust.
Coinbase previously attempted to operate under its own token listing standards, but the SECâs view under chairman Gary Gensler at the time was basically that everything but bitcoin was a security. This eventually led to an SEC enforcement action against Coinbase, which has since been dropped.
They do, that's a known thing
— Larry Cermak (@lawmaster) December 7, 2020

Whether Coinbase can operate as a credible, neutral authority on new token sales is up to the discretion of its users. However, it should be noted that the crypto exchange previously took tokens from various projects for its Coinbase Earn project, where its users were provided with free tokens in exchange for reading about the associated projects. Put differently, Coinbase was provided with funds from token projects that were then provided to users as an incentive to sign up in exchange for creating promotional content about those same tokens.
Congress is also expected to pass its own standards and form of regulatory clarity to the crypto market in the form of the Clarity Act. That said, the odds of that passage occurring this year have dropped from a high of 87% to 21% since July, according to prediction market Polymarket.
This latest move from Coinbase is yet another example of the lines between crypto and traditional finance becoming increasingly blurred. Under this new structure, ICOs look more like initial public offerings (IPOs) with Coinbase acting as a gatekeeper of sorts in terms of which projects get the stamp of approval.
So, we now have a centralized financial institution operating an initial investment platform built on U.S. dollar-based rails (the platform uses the Coinbase-partnered USDC stablecoin from Circle) for projects that are increasingly looking more like traditional fintech than anything truly decentralized or operating outside of the traditional financial system.
It seems the crypto sector has moved far away from the original ideology Satoshi Nakamoto had when creating Bitcoin, as he pointed to âall the trust that’s required to make it workâ as the source of the problems with traditional finance that he intended to solve.

67,2025-11-10,"""A family based in north London seeks an extraordinary and experienced tutor to support their youngest child on his first steps to becoming an English gentleman.""
When reading this advert, you would be forgiven for skimming over the words ""first steps"", as a turn of phrase. 
But, it could be the most significant part of this unique job advert, as it seeks to find a tutor for a one-year-old.
Hundreds of applications have now been submitted since the anonymous family published their request for the £180k-a-year tutor, who has to be ""someone very special"". 
Over the last few weeks, the advert has gained attention across the media, with many questioning why?
Adam Caller, CEO and founder of Tutors International, which is assisting the family in their search, said despite initial scepticism, he found the idea ""far sighted"", and ""progressive"".
When he met the family, he said they appreciated the unusual nature of their request, and how young their son is. 
However, they explained that they ""didn't want to wait any longer"" to get a tutor, as they had waited until their older child was five, and by that stage ""cultural bias had already set in"". 
But what does the family mean by ""cultural bias""? 
It's ""everything"", Adam replied. ""The way you eat, the way you speak."" 
He said the older sibling had picked ""really subtle, non-verbal cues"" from the family, and had adopted their cultural ways. The family told Adam they did not want history to repeat itself with their new baby. 
The plan: To bring in a British tutor, who must speak with received pronunciation, to influence the baby right from the beginning. 
""A lot of the learning at the beginning here is kind of osmotic,"" said Adam. 
It's via this osmosis that the family are hoping the child will pick up the British traits they wish to instil. 
Adam said the tutor had to be somebody who went to ""the right kinds of schools - the same kinds of schools as the family aspire to send their son to"".
""The tutor just has to be the right kind of person, they'll be doing things they don't even know they're doing, just naturally,"" he said. 
The family told Adam the successful candidate should ideally also have knowledge of or interest in horse-riding, skiing, the arts and music so as to influence the child in a broad spectrum of interests.
More than that though, he said the family wanted the tutor to enrol the child on a range of classes so the child would be ""pony-riding and picking up an instrument by the time they are around three years old"". 
In the family's minds, helping their son become a ""British gentleman"" will lead to success and open doors. 
""For all the rights and wrongs of that, because it's definitely a class statement,"" he adds. 
But, despite all this tutelage in ""Britishness"", could the child pick up so-called cultural bias from the international family he lives with anyway?
""Yes"", said Adam. ""The family know this may not work, but they've just taken the view of, 'let's give it a go and let's go as early as we can', because the cost of it is not relevant,"" he said. 
There are some in the tutoring industry who share those concerns.
Peter Cui, CEO and founder of Blue Education, which also offers private tutors, wrote in a blog that ""the process of becoming bicultural, or indeed, becoming oneself, is something that must be lived into, not engineered"".
Peter wrote that he had moved from China to the UK at the age of seven, and had been raised knowing and living both cultures. He went on to study at Cambridge University. 
""The idea that one individual can serve as a living vessel of Britishness, someone who can somehow transplant the qualities of a British gentleman on to a one-year-old child, strikes me as idealistic and unrealistic,"" he wrote.
""In my experience, having a quintessentially British tutor from infancy will not automatically produce the outcome they desire.
""I never had such a figure, and yet I have been fortunate enough to live many of the experiences they aspire for their son.""
He added: ""The truth is, cultural identity cannot be imposed from the outside; it must be chosen, and it must come from within.""
Of course, Britishness is something Adam hopes can be taught - and sold. 
""I think the fact that the world holds us in this regard is something that we should be cherishing and taking advantage of at the same time,"" he said.
""I don't think that, as British people, we should be embarrassed by this,"" Adam said.
""I think we should be proud of it.""
The market for buying Britishness isn't just helping Adam's tutoring business, it's given rise to businesses such as Laura Windsor's Etiquette Academy. 
Laura, like other ""etiquette experts"", can teach people - for a fee - how to take afternoon tea, dress and hold a conversation, ""like a British person"".
""Society has become so diluted and unrestrained, people now want to go back to the way it was,"" she said. 
The demand for etiquette training is mainly from international clients who wish to be able to interact at business meetings and functions, she said. 
But she also teaches groups of children too. Why?
""Because being a polite gentleman or gentlewoman is all about first impressions,"" she said. 
""Being polite means you respect other people, you make them feel comfortable and important. When you make people feel important, you're liked, and that opens doors to incredible opportunities.""
She says she teaches people how it's ""all in the details"": ""It's about opening doors, and saying 'please' and 'thank you', and thinking about the other person.""
Laura's students are never usually as young as one, but starting that young is something the etiquette expert says can have benefits.
""Starting at one, they will grow up being a gentleman, and therefore it's not a question of 'tweaking', it's who they are.
""Whereas nowadays, people need to be tweaked a little bit, to be a little bit more aware of what they do,"" she said. 
Raising his children to be classically British - with all the etiquette trimmings - is not the priority for Daniel (not his real name). 
""Far from leaning into English, British values, we wanted the total opposite. We are trying to go away from the UK system and the straitjacket of that,"" he said.
Daniel is currently employing one of Adam's super-tutors to work with his three children around their school hours. 
Next year the tutor will accompany the whole family as they move abroad for work. 
For Daniel and his wife, it's about teaching emotional intelligence, and preparing their children for a world influenced by artificial intelligence. Neither believes this is possible without an external tutor.
The current British school system ""isn't fit for purpose"", he said, adding that one private school in London, Latymer Upper School, has now dropped most of the GCSE examination system and instead uses its own in-house system which involves more group work activities and project-based learning.
""If GCSEs aren't going to be recognised everywhere - and are not the gold standard - maybe we would be better leaning into a tutor where we get so much more out of it,"" Daniel said.
""Right here, right now, in the UK school system, if I look at the quality of teacher my kids would get at a private school versus these tutors, it's an absolute joke - there is a real discrepancy,"" he said. 
He added that he recognised hiring a high-end tutor was for ""those in a lucky financial situation"", but explained that since private school fees increased following the addition of VAT in January, he felt the cost of the private tutor had become comparable for three children. 
""My kids could have one-20th of a very average person's attention in school, or they could have one-third of an absolutely exceptional person - it's an absolute no-brainer.""

From roughly the end of the US Civil War until the late 1950s, the United Kingdom was one of the biggest shipbuilders in the world. By the 1890s, UK shipbuilders were delivering 80% of worldwide shipping tonnage, and though the country only briefly maintained this market-dominating level of output— on the eve of World War I, its share of the market had fallen to 60% — it nonetheless remained one of the world’s largest shipbuilders for the next several decades.
Following the end of WWII, UK shipbuilding appeared ascendant. The shipbuilding industries of most other countries had been devastated by the war (or were, like Japan, prevented from building new ships), and in the immediate years after the war the UK built more ship tonnage than the rest of the world combined.
But this success was short-lived. The UK ultimately proved unable to respond to competitors who entered the market with new, large shipyards which employed novel methods of shipbuilding developed by the US during WWII. The UK fell from producing 57% of world tonnage in 1947 to just 17% a decade later. By the 1970s their output was below 5% of world total, and by the 1990s it was less than 1%. In 2023, the UK produced no commercial ships at all.
Ultimately, UK shipbuilding was undone by the very thing that had made it successful: it developed a production system that heavily leveraged skilled labor, and minimized the need for expensive infrastructure or management overheads. For a time, this system had allowed UK shipbuilders to produce ships more cheaply and efficiently than almost anywhere else. But as the nature of the shipping market, and of ships themselves, changed, the UK proved unable to change its industry in response, and it steadily lost ground to international competitors.
For much of recent history, the Netherlands boasted the largest and most successful shipbuilding industry. Between 1500 and 1670, Dutch shipping had grown by a factor of 10, and by the end of the 17th century the Dutch merchant fleet, made up of mostly Dutch-made ships, was larger than the commercial fleets of England, France, Spain, Portugal, and what is now Germany combined. Dutch shipbuilding was “technologically the most advanced in Europe,” and Dutch shipbuilders could build ships 40-50% cheaper than English ones.
Over the course of the 18th century, however, the Dutch advantage was gradually eroded by “a failure to keep pace with advances in European sailing ship design and an inherent conservatism within the industry.” But while it briefly looked like the UK would come to dominate shipbuilding in the early 19th century, the mantle instead passed to the United States. By the middle of the 19th century, thanks in part to the easy availability of ship-quality lumber, the US could build wooden ships for 20 to 25% less than in the UK, and “the very existence of the British industry was under threat”.
But as wooden sailing ships gave way to iron and steel steamships over the course of the 19th century, the UK reclaimed its advantage. By the 1850s, the UK was building iron ships more cheaply than wood ships, and while it took decades for iron, steel and steam to displace wood and sail — sail remained a better option than steam for very long voyages until the 1880s — Britain’s access to cheap coal, cheap iron (and later cheap steel), and cheap skilled labor (compared to the US) allowed it to dominate the transformed shipbuilding industry. By 1900, UK shipbuilding productivity was substantially higher than in the US, and even further ahead of other countries. The UK had become the “shipyard of the world” on the back of its inexpensive production.
The structure of the UK’s shipbuilding industry reflected the conditions it operated under. Building iron and steel ships obviously required machinery and infrastructure — machine tools, cranes, slipways (sloped areas of ground the ship would slide down upon completion) — but wherever possible, British yards still eschewed expensive machinery or infrastructure in favor of skilled labor. British yards in the late 19th and early 20th century have been described as “under-equipped in relation to those of her competitors”: for instance, while the most advanced foreign yards had large, mechanically operated cranes that could be moved from berth to berth, most British yards “retained their fixed cranes, manually operated derricks, and push-carts on rails”. Because of the notoriously cyclical shipbuilding industry, which often had “seven fat years followed by seven lean years”, using labor-intensive production methods let shipbuilders easily scale up and down their operations depending on demand: workers could be hired when they were needed, and quickly fired when weren’t. A capital intensive production operation, by contrast, couldn’t easily reduce its overheads during a downturn: one extremely large, modern, and expensive British shipyard at Dalmuir was forced to close in 1929 due to difficulty servicing its overheads when demand for new ships fell.
British shipbuilders’ production operations were in large part oriented to meet the needs of British shipowners, who made up the majority of their customers. Shipyards (and their owners) developed close relationships with shipowners, who would purchase from the same yards repeatedly; as a result, shipyards did little in the way of marketing their services. Ships in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were “expensive, custom-made commodities built in close consultation with the owner”. Frequent changes during the building process by the owner were common, and standardization was limited to non-existent. With limited ability to take advantage of economies of scale, shipyards were small and numerous, and while yards tended to specialize in certain types of ships, labor-intensive production methods made it comparatively easy for yards to adapt to producing different types of ships depending on the market.
In addition to minimizing infrastructure overheads, British shipyards had low management overheads; much of the work was performed by skilled labor organized into “squads,” groups of tradesmen which could organize work without needing much in the way of specific instructions. As a result, British shipyards employed comparatively few supervisors, and did little in the way of production planning.
Because shipyard workers had little in the way of job security, the British shipbuilding industry became strongly unionized. Iron shipbuilding was done by a group of 15 different unions — riveters, boilermakers, plumbers, and so on — and there were very strict rules about which unions were allowed to do which tasks. This arrangement had its advantages — unions oversaw much of the training and apprenticeship of new workers, and allowed the work to be done with comparatively little management overhead. But it also had drawbacks: the union’s (rational) lack of trust in the shipbuilders, who they correctly viewed as considering their workers disposable, resulted in fierce opposition to changes in the nature of ship production, and made introducing method improvements fraught.
The first cracks in British shipbuilding hegemony began to appear after World War I. Immediately following the war, the world saw a huge increase in demand for ships: in 1919, worldwide ship production was 7.1 million gross tons, up more than double the pre-war peak of 3.3 million tons in 1913. Initially much of this output was American (thanks to the continuation of the wartime shipbuilding program past the end of the war), but as this program ended the UK was once again dominant: by 1924 the UK was producing 60% of the world’s ship tonnage.
But the competitive landscape of the shipbuilding industry was changing. Worldwide shipyard capacity after the war was roughly double what it had been before it. Other countries were eager to give support to their local shipbuilding industries, and foreign shipyards were catching up to British levels of productivity.
Ships and the methods for producing them were also changing. New shipyard layouts and new production techniques such as welding were being experimented with, and new types of ships such as diesel-powered ships and tankers — kinds of ships British shipowners and shipbuilders seemed less interested in building — were increasingly in demand. When the booming shipbuilding market entered a downturn in the 1920s — worldwide ship output dropped from over 7 million gross tons in 1919 to 2.2 million in 1924 — the competitive pressure on British shipbuilders began to mount. In 1925 the British shipbuilding community was shocked when Furness Withy, a British shipping company, ordered several ships from Germany, citing lower costs and faster delivery times. The news was surprising enough that a British shipbuilding trade association called an emergency conference on the problem of foreign competition:
The employers reviewed the history of foreign competition and conceded that whilst before the war foreign competition had presented a threat, ‘the margin of difference then was sufficiently limited’ to prevent a successful challenge to our premier position and certainly such a catastrophe as an important British order going abroad’. The margin of difference, however, now favoured continental builders and there was every prospect of more British orders going abroad and fewer foreign orders coming to the UK.
What’s more, the postwar boom in shipbuilding had created a huge glut in ships and shipbuilding capacity. In the early 1920s British shipbuilding had a third more capacity than it did before the war, only to be faced with demand less than half of what it was in 1914. By 1933, worldwide seaborne trade was down 6% from 1913, but the tonnage of merchant ship capacity was up by 49%, greatly reducing demand for new ships.
British shipbuilding was further hamstrung by the Washington Naval Treaty, which was signed in 1922 and then extended by the London Naval Treaty in 1930. The treaty, signed by the UK, the US, France, Italy and Japan, attempted to prevent a naval arms race by limiting naval vessel construction for each signatory. What had been a robust British program of naval expansion was suddenly halted. Following the treaty, British naval shipbuilding fell by over 90%.
The lack of shipbuilding, increased pressure from foreign competition, and the global decline in new ship orders wreaked havoc on the British shipbuilding industry in the 1920s and 30s, to the benefit of its competitors. The UK’s fraction of worldwide ship tonnage produced declined from 60% in 1924 to 50% by the end of the 1920s, to less than 40% by the mid-1930s. Over the same period, Germany, Sweden, and Japan’s combined share rose from 12% to 36%. Numerous British shipbuilding firms ceased operations, and shipbuilding unemployment rose from 5.5% in 1920 to over 40% in 1929. In the first 9 months of 1930, only one in five of British shipbuilders received any orders at all.
To help address the problem of excess shipyard capacity, British shipbuilders banded together to form the National Shipbuilders Security (NSS) company, which was funded to “assist the shipbuilding industry by the purchase of redundant and/or obsolete shipyards and dismantling and disposal of their contents.”. By 1938, over 216 ship berths had been demolished. The NSS also made efforts to try to improve productivity and improve the competitive position of British shipyards compared to foreign yards, though it’s not clear if this had much impact: by 1938, foreign orderbooks appeared far fuller than British ones, and the industry was palpably worried about the threat of foreign competition. It wasn’t until the Royal Navy began a period of rearmament in the late 1930s in anticipation of war that fortunes began to improve for the UK shipbuilders.
Following the end of WWII, fortunes initially looked bright for the British shipbuilding industry. German and European shipbuilding capacity had been devastated by the war, the US was dismantling its enormous wartime shipbuilding machine, and Japan was forced to cease ship production. In the immediate years following the war, the UK was once again producing more ship tonnage than the rest of the world combined.
But the issues of foreign competition that had increasingly threatened the UK’s dominance prior to WW2 had only retreated temporarily. What’s more, during the war, developments had taken place that would threaten the skilled labor-intensive production model that British shipbuilders relied on. To win the Battle of the Atlantic and overcome destruction to their fleet caused by German U-boats, the US had used welded, prefabricated construction to rapidly build enormous numbers of simple cargo ships: Liberty ships, Victory ships, and T-2 Tankers. In the 1950s, those methods of ship construction were brought to Japan, where they continued to be refined.
British shipbuilders could have taken advantage of these methods as well. They had seen firsthand the huge number of Liberty ships American shipyards were producing (the Liberty ship was, after all, originally a British design), and had made use of welded, prefabricated construction themselves to build vessels during wartime. But British shipbuilders perceived adopting these radically different production methods as risky. It would require enormous capital expenditure, and British shipbuilders had only survived the brutal 1930s thanks to their comparatively light overheads and labor-intensive methods. Dramatic changes to production methods would also require changes to the very strict demarcation system of its unionized labor force, which the unions, naturally distrustful of shipyard operators, were sure to resist. And while the US had successfully built thousands of ships very rapidly during the war, it had come at a cost: the US cargo ships, using modern methods, were more expensive to build than similar British ships. Though some British shipbuilders recognized the potential of welding and prefabrication, they weren’t clearly worth reorganizing the entire industry around.
And beyond their rational reluctance, British shipbuilders were simply not predisposed towards adopting radical innovations. Many of them (along with many British shipowners) were suspicious of welding, partly due to natural conservatism and partly due to several high-profile failures where welded ships cracked in two. (As late as 1954, British shipbuilders noted that “owners do not want a welded box, they expect plenty of riveting.”) British shipbuilders similarly proved somewhat reluctant to enter the world of tanker and diesel-powered ship construction, which were becoming an increasingly large fraction of ship construction. They also seemed to always have an excuse for not making large, new capital investments: when the yards were busy, such investments were disruptive and made it difficult to get on with the business of building ships, and when they weren’t, there was no funding available to do so. Shipbuilders were often small, family-run businesses, sometimes by descendants of the original founders, and they were generally happy to simply carry on business as they always had. And broader ownership did not foster innovation either, with firms distributing their profits as dividends rather than reinvesting them in the business, driving the stock prices of shipbuilders up more than any other manufacturing industry.
Moreover, British shipyards tended to be cramped, with little room for expansion, and British shipbuilders were fearful that any postwar boom in shipbuilding would (once again) be followed by a bust, requiring retrenchment and making investment in expanding facilities unwise. (One British shipbuilder predicted that “it will be a case of last in, first out, and that Britain’s policy of modernising her shipyards without any great expansion of their capacity will pay dividends in her future competition.”)
Thus, even as the world shipbuilding market boomed in the 1950s, UK shipbuilding output stayed roughly constant. Between 1947 and 1957, UK ship output rose by 18%, while worldwide output comparatively rose by over 300%. Countries like Germany, Sweden, and Japan picked up the slack. The UK lost its position as the world’s biggest shipbuilder by tonnage to Japan in 1956. By the end of the 1950s, Germany and Sweden had passed the UK in ship tonnage built for export and by the end of the 1960s they were outproducing the UK in overall ship tonnage. Between 1950 and 1975, one of the largest shipbuilding booms in history, the UK was the only major shipbuilding country to not increase its output at all.
As other countries expanded their output, adopted modern production methods, and built new, efficient shipyards, British shipbuilders found themselves increasingly uncompetitive. Their costs were higher than those of foreign shipbuilders, and their delivery times were longer. Shipbuilding had traditionally been done on a “cost plus” basis, where owners were charged some percentage above costs incurred when building the ship, but owners were increasingly requiring fixed price bidding. British shipbuilders, with their comparative lack of production planning and managerial control, struggled to adapt to the new reality. British shipowners, traditionally the primary customer of British shipyards, were increasingly buying their ships abroad, citing the UK’s high costs and long delivery times.
Investigations into potential problems in the shipbuilding industry started shortly into the post-war era. In 1948, following a British shipowner cancelling several orders with British yards due to “costs and delivery times,” the government stepped in to conduct analyses of the shipbuilding industry. One, produced by the Labour Party’s research arm, argued that “that new methods of construction, utilising welding and prefabrication, required a complete reconstruction of the yards, and that this could be best achieved via Government finance and assistance…It seems inevitable that a prosperous shipbuilding industry will require heavy expenditure and it is very doubtful whether the industry is willing and or able to undertake this.” The other, produced by the Shipbuilding Costs Committee (staffed largely by industry leaders), was a “’a very non-controversial report,’ which provided ‘no useful recommendations on which action could be taken.’” In light of the industry’s full postwar order books, the government opted not to take any action.
In the mid-1950s, the government examined the practices of British naval shipbuilding, and concluded that “there was a need for a wholesale modernisation of the shipyards in terms of layouts, plant and equipment particularly to increase the use of prefabrication.”
The return on capital employed and investment rates were criticised as poor and British costs were felt to be comparatively high in international terms. Restrictive practices were noted, but more worryingly there was a shortage of skilled labour in the industry, which was responsible for the British single-shift system, with consequently expensive overtime, compared with the double-shift system which was normal on the Continent and in Japan.
A 1957 report from the Working Party on the Transport of Oil From the Middle East similarly noted that the industry had been “sluggish in responding to the opportunities from expansion” and criticized its lack of investment (though it did note that some shipyards had begun some degree of modernization).
As the booming shipbuilding market turned at the end of the 1950s, these investigations grew more frequent and more worried. A 1959 Treasury report concluded the industry “is not competitive. It has not modernised its production methods and organisation so quickly or so thoroughly as its competitors. Its labour relations are poor, and its management, while improving, is not as good as it might be.” It was further “pessimistic over delivery dates and prices and concluded that the prospects of the industry becoming competitive could not be rated very high.”
This report was followed in 1960 by a Department of Scientific and Industrial Research report on the shipbuilding industry, which declared that the industry’s R&D efforts had been “woeful”:
…production control in the industry was primitive, the total effort devoted to research and development was insufficient, and almost no organised research had been applied to production and management problems with a view to improving the productivity of capital and labour and reducing costs.1
That same year, the head of the UK’s Shipbuilding Advisory Committee staged a high-profile resignation, stating that the excuses of the industry to avoid investigating its problems were “so frustrating that to continue serving the industry as chairman would be fruitless.” In response to the resignation, in 1961, the Advisory Committee released a report on the shipbuilding industry. However, other than arguing that credit facilities (lending to shipowners to make purchasing ships easier) should be expanded, the report gave few strong recommendations.
The Shipbuilding Advisory Committee report was followed by another government-commissioned report on why British shipowners were buying from foreign yards; the report concluded that the major reasons were “price; price and delivery date; price and credit facilities; guaranteed delivery dates; and the reluctance of British builders to install foreign-built engines.”
As the industry continued to struggle in the 1960s, the reports piled up even higher. A 1962 report on productivity commissioned by the British Ship Research Association noted “the underdeveloped nature of managerial hierarchies in the industry as a serious weakness and recommended a more systematic approach to production control”. A report by the British Ship Exports Association on the Norwegian market (traditionally one of Britain’s strongest ship export markets) noted that “Norwegian customers... have voiced a series of complaints, the principal of which. .. is that in addition to regarding us as unreliable over delivery, many are now saying that we cannot be trusted to honour contracts.” The author of the report noted that:
…every reported speech by a British shipbuilder in the Norwegian press usually comprised a list of excuses for poor performance, ranging from official and unofficial stoppages, shortages of labour, failings on the part of subcontractors, modernisation schemes not producing the anticipated results, to recently completed contracts having entailed substantial losses. The impression thus gained by the Norwegians, according to Holt, was of an industry where the shipbuilders had no control or responsibility over problems, and worse, had no ideas as to how to address the problems. (since 1918 147).
Accordingly, the UK’s share of Norwegian shipbuilding, its largest export market, fell from 48% in 1951 to 2.8% in 1965.
As reports documenting the UK’s shipbuilding troubles accumulated, things continued to look worse and worse for the shipbuilders. The market for ocean liners, once a major source of demand for British shipbuilders, was being threatened by the rise of commercial air travel. Transatlantic travel by air surpassed transatlantic ocean travel in 1957, and the ascendance of commercial jetliners further eroded the market. By 1969, passengers crossing the Atlantic by plane outnumbered maritime passengers 24 to 1. And the explosion of global trade in the 1950s and 60s was met not just with more ships, but with larger ships (such as Very Large Crude Carriers for transporting oil) which were cheaper to build and operate. The simple Liberty ship built in huge numbers by the US during the war was about 10,000 tons deadweight, but by the end of the 1950s Japan was building ships in excess of 100,000 tons deadweight.
Likewise, by the end of the 1960s Japanese shipyards were building drydocks with 400,000 tons capacity. By comparison, British shipyards, which had been built in an era of much smaller ships, had trouble accommodating these huge ships, in part due to lack of space for expansion. (Some space-constrained British yards attempted to get around their space constraints by building large ships in two halves, which were then stitched together in the water.) And as ships got larger, prefabricated construction methods got more advanced, utilizing massive gantry cranes to assemble ships out of huge pre-built blocks. Advances in prefabrication continued to drive down costs in the shipyards that implemented them. Between 1958 and 1964, the labor hours required to build a given amount of tonnage in a Japanese shipyard fell by 60%, and the amount of steel fell by 36%. Over the same period the UK’s share of global shipbuilding fell from 15% to 8%.
Throughout this period, major advances in ship technology were increasingly happened outside the UK. A history of UK shipbuilding noted that 13 of 15 major ship innovations introduced between 1800 and 1950 were first widely adopted in Britain. But of 14 major innovations introduced between 1950 and 1980, only three were first widely adopted in Britain.
Neither the government nor the British shipbuilding industry seemed willing to take bold steps to try to improve its fortunes. The Board of Trade stated in 1960 that there was little point to government intervention “until the prospects of the industry are very patently bad”. Despite the numerous government reports pointing out the various industry deficiencies, by 1963 the only government action that had been taken was the aforementioned expansion of credit facilities to shipowners. British shipbuilders remained convinced that a decline in the market was just around the corner and that the expensive shipyards of their competitors would become millstones. And despite the shipbuilding market shifting towards larger, more standardized ships sold at fixed prices, UK builders tried to stick with their tried-and-true strategy of ships tailor-built to the needs of British shipowners. But as British shipowners, who themselves made up an increasingly small fraction of global shipping (the UK’s share of global shipping tonnage fell from 45% in 1900 to 16% in 1960), increasingly took their business to foreign shipyards, British shipbuilders found that “the protective skin that tradition and convention gave to the home market has been split beyond repair”. By 1962, the bankruptcy of many UK shipbuilders had finally become “an alarming reality rather than an impending possibility”.
It wasn’t until after the 1964 elections, with a new Labour government, that more serious actions to rescue the shipbuilding industry began to be taken (possibly because the “vast majority of shipbuilding yards lay within Labour parliamentary seats”). In early 1965, a British group led by the Minister of Trade visited several Japanese shipyards, which were found to have lower costs, shorter delivery times, and higher productivity than British yards. Following this visit, the government instigated yet another investigation into the British shipbuilding industry. The resulting report (known as the Geddes report, after Reay Geddes, the head of the committee that produced it), enumerated a long list of problems of UK shipbuilders, including high costs (20% more than competitors on average), long delivery times, late deliveries, out of date infrastructure, poor labor relations, and poor management. Moreover, even at prices 20% higher than their competitors, British shipyards struggled to be profitable, with the report noting that “many of the orders now in hand will not be remunerative to cover costs”.
British shipyards’ traditional production methods, which demanded little in the way of management, meant that yards had few supervisors. The supervisors they did have had often worked their way up from the shop floor and had never received any business or management training. As a result, production planning and estimates of labor required were poor. While this may have been acceptable when vessels were custom-produced on a cost-plus basis, it made yards ill-equipped for a market where fixed-cost pricing was the norm. A history of British shipbuilding noted that “in an increasingly competitive industry British shipyards did not successfully perform the financial management tasks—marketing, budgeting and procurement--necessary to build vessels profitably.”
The Geddes report also noted that labor relations were abysmal, and strict adherence to labor demarcation rules (which themselves varied extensively from yard to yard) greatly hampered productivity. The labor demarcation problem was so severe that in some yards it literally took three different workers to change a lightbulb:
…a laborer (member of the Transport and General Workers Union) [to] carry the ladder to site, a rigger (member of the Amalgamated Society of Boilermakers, Shipwrights, Blacksmiths and Structural Workers Union) [to] erect it and place it in the proper position, and an electrician (member of the Electrical Trades Union) [to] actually remove the old bulb and screw in the new one. Production was often halted while waiting for a member of the appropriate union to arrive to perform the job reserved by agreement for them. (sunset 96)
The Geddes committee further argued that none of these issues could be fixed at the scale contemporary shipbuilders were operating at, and that a prerequisite for rescuing the industry was grouping existing shipbuilders together to give them the scale needed to be internationally competitive. The report recommended consolidation, and for a comparatively small amount of government financing (37.5 million pounds in grants and loans, and another 30 million in credit guarantees) to be awarded over the next four years to shipbuilders that consolidated and met a strict set of performance targets.
In 1967, the Shipbuilding Inquiry Act implementing the Geddes Report’s recommendations, was passed, and over the next several years, 27 major British shipbuilders were consolidated into 12 groups (though some of these “groups” were groups of just one). As shipyards consolidated, government financing began to flow: between 1967 and 1972 almost 160 million pounds (much more than had been recommended by the Geddes Report) were provided by the government to various shipbuilders, and the shipping board made recommendations for over a billion pounds worth of bank loan guarantees for British shipowners purchasing in British yards.
None of this helped stem the decline. By 1971, the government-backed British shipyards had achieved “no gains in competitiveness, no improvement in turnover, falling profitability and cash resources [that were] becoming rapidly inadequate.” Late deliveries continued to dog the shipbuilders: from 1967 to 1971 nearly 40% of British ships were 1 month late, and nearly 10% were six months late. With fixed-cost contracts, stiff penalties for late deliveries, and rapid inflation (over 20% from 1967 to 1971), late deliveries drastically eroded profitability, and much of the government funding actually went to writing off shipbuilders’ losses. Between 1967 and 1972 three major shipbuilders — Upper Clyde Shipbuilders (a post-Geddes amalgamation of several smaller builders), Cammell Laird, and Harland and Wolff (the company that built the Titanic, once the largest shipbuilder in the world) — were rescued from bankruptcy and became owned “wholly or in part by the British government”. In the early 1970s, the shipbuilding industry performed “even below the Geddes ‘worst case scenario”.
The industry’s failure to improve seems to be partly due to a lack of urgency on the shipbuilders part. A combination of factors (British pound devaluation, unexpectedly high enthusiasm for the credit offerings for British shipowners, the Suez canal closing) created enough demand for British ships in the late 1960s that the orderbooks swelled. While these orders were a small fraction of worldwide orders, the rise in demand was sufficient to dampen the urgency for reforming shipbuilding practices. In 1972, yet another report on the British shipbuilding industry (this one produced by Booz-Allen Hamilton), was released. It found that nearly every problem listed in the Geddes report had gotten worse:
This review of the U.K. shipbuilding industry is pessimistic about the general background situation, and critical of the industry in many areas. U.K. yards generally are under-capitalized and poorly managed; the industry has a poor reputation amongst its customers, particularly for delivery and labour relations; overseas competition has moved more rapidly to modernize and re-equip its facilities and is now better placed to face the forecast surplus of capacity which will exist for the remainder of the 1970’s
Even companies that had invested in the infrastructure they needed to compete in the modern shipbuilding world found themselves struggling. Harland and Wolff, for instance, had been “reconfigured in the 1960s to build tankers of up to 1 million deadweight tons”:
…it should have thrived during the 1967-73 large tanker boom. Instead, due to the typical British shipbuilding problems of high costs, low productivity, poor labor relations, and late delivery, it lost money even with a full order book.
The problem of money-losing contracts became so severe that some British shipbuilders found themselves paying owners to cancel contracts they were unable to build profitably.
With seemingly no way of returning the industry to commercial profitability, and already operating struggling shipbuilders directly, the government moved to full nationalization. In 1974, a Labour government was elected with promises to nationalize the industry, which eventually took place in 1977. The Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act of 1977 created a new company, British Shipbuilders, encompassing 97% of Britain’s commercial shipbuilding capacity.2
But even nationalization did nothing to rescue the industry. After peaking in 1975, the worldwide shipbuilding market collapsed in the wake of the 1973 energy crisis. The shipbuilding industries in countries like Japan became desperate for new orders, and recent, subsidized entrants like South Korea, Taiwan and Brazil were hungry as well. In the face of such fierce competition, the new British Shipbuilders company wilted. Despite taking virtually any order that it could get, even at loss-making prices, the UK’s shipbuilding industry continued its inexorable decline. Between 1975 and 1985, the UK’s shipbuilding output declined by nearly 90%, and its share of the world market fell from 3.6% to less than 1%. British Shipbuilders began re-privatization in 1983 with the passage of the British Shipbuilders Act, and over the next several years most of those newly privatized yards would close. In 2024, the UK produced just 0.01% of the commercial ship tonnage built worldwide that year. In 2022 and 2023, the percentage was 0.
In his book on the decline of the British shipbuilding industry, Edward Lorenz argues that while British shipbuilders precipitated their own decline, their decisions were essentially rational, the product of the constraints that they were operating under at the time. A production system based heavily on leveraging skilled, union-trained labor, minimizing the need for expensive infrastructure or equipment and with a minimum of management overheads helped keep British costs low; the labor force could be scaled up and down depending on demand, and workers could easily move from yard to yard as the work required. This production system worked reasonably well for decades, and only truly began to unravel after WWII, when the shipbuilding market transformed technologically and transactionally, and began demanding much larger vessels, made from welded, block-construction, sold under fixed price contracts.
While British shipbuilders could have responded by enthusiastically embracing the new methods, they had learned from a lifetime of doing business in a wildly fluctuating market that investments in expensive new shipbuilding infrastructure or high-overhead production methods were risky. Their strategy of rapidly scaling their labor force depending on day-to-day needs had bred a deep distrust between management and labor, and created a strict demarcation system that was difficult to dislodge. Decades of urban development in port cities had made physical expansion of shipyards difficult. Uncertainty about whether transformation was truly needed, and the certainty of costly disruptions should they try, resulted in British shipbuilders sticking with their existing production methods as the rest of the world passed them by.
Moreover, globally the economic pressure to shift shipbuilding towards locations with lower labor costs was immense. Sweden modernized its operations far more effectively than the UK, and was one of the most efficient, capable shipbuilding countries in the world in the post-war era, but this didn’t stop the Swedish shipbuilding industry from being hollowed out in the face of competition from Asian producers. Similarly, Japan’s skill in shipbuilding hasn’t stopped it from losing ground to China in recent years.
There’s a telling bit in a book about the nationalized British Shipbuilders company called “Crossing the Bar”. At an international shipbuilders conference in London in 1983, a UK shipbuilder asked a Korean delegate why they were keeping their prices so low. The delegate responded that they weren’t worried about UK or European competition, or even Japanese competition: they were worried about China. Several decades on, Korea is now losing ground in the shipbuilding market to China too. So, it’s not clear if a much more vigorous British shipbuilding industry would have been all that much more successful in resisting its ultimate decline.
Nevertheless, the lack of motivation (rational or otherwise) of British shipbuilders to modernize their operations certainly did not help. Perhaps they would have ultimately lost out to low-cost Korean and Japanese builders anyway, but had they shared Japan’s “burning zeal” to make their industry competitive, they might have kept the wind in their sails longer.
The DSIR report was initially leaked to the media, and the final published version was stripped of much of its more trenchant criticism.
Harland and Wolff, despite then being owned by the British government, was left as an independent entity due to political concerns regarding Northern Ireland.
Your story describes strikingly well the downfall of Baldwin Locomotive Works.  They, too, worked in an industry prone to the whiplash effect, and adapted with a capital-light system that relied on skilled labor in precarious employment.  Their products had almost no standardization (and thus no interchangeability), compensated for via close relationships with local customers (Baldwin's biggest orders came from the PRR across town).  And farly failures with experimental diesel prime movers meant they rejected the locomotives of the future until it was too late.   
Thanks a lot - well prepared report with the interesting details

    We talked to experts and did the math across the different vehicle costs over 15 years to see which one is the cheapest in the long run. The answer might surprise you. 

  
The federal government's $7,500 discount on electric vehicles has officially ended, which significantly changes the math of EV ownership. It might make you wonder: Is it more economical to buy a gas-powered car now?
This is a fair question, but the sticker price of a car (and the lack of a government rebate) is only one piece of the total cost of vehicle ownership, which also includes fuel costs, maintenance and depreciation.
When you take that all into account, EVs are still usually cheaper to own in the long run, according to auto experts. We did the math to show you how the costs break down, and how you can make an accurate comparison before making your next car purchase.
The sticker price is what most people think about when they compare the prices of different cars. From that perspective, the disappearance of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit puts EVs at a significant disadvantage on upfront costs when compared to gasoline or passive-hybrid cars.
When it comes to upfront costs, we've mapped out the winner, loser and runner-up.
Winner 🏆
Internal combustion engine vehicles
Traditional gasoline cars usually have the lowest sticker price compared to their electrified counterparts. These types of vehicles have long-established supply chains and economies of scale that make them cheaper to manufacture, according to Antuan Goodwin, CNET's EV senior writer.
Runner-up 🥈
Hybrid vehicles
Hybrid-electric vehicles often have a slight premium over pure gas cars due to the dual gas and electric powertrain, but are usually still more affordable than most pure EVs.
Loser 💸
Electric vehicles
Electric cars are typically at the top end for sticker price. ""The battery is going to be the biggest reason that EVs are more expensive,"" Goodwin says. EVs also don't benefit as much from economies of scale. Plus, consumers are still subsidizing the research and development that legacy automakers are doing to design electric cars, according to Amelia Dalgaard, an automotive expert known online as Motorhead Mama.
You can't control gas prices, but you can control how much you spend to fuel up.
This is where you start to see some of the biggest savings between EVs and gasoline-powered vehicles. Here's how the costs shake out:
Winner 🏆
Electric vehicles
The cost of charging an EV depends a lot on your local electricity rates, and on where you charge your vehicle. Charging at home with a Level 2 charger is usually the cheapest way to fuel your EV, while public Level 3 fast-chargers are usually the most expensive. Generally speaking, charging an EV at home is cheaper than fueling a comparable car with gasoline, according to Goodwin and Dalgaard. For that average 11,000 miles per year, at the national average electricity rate, you'd spend $550 on charging.
Runner-up 🥈
Hybrid vehicles
The fuel costs for passive hybrids are usually lower than regular gas cars because they get better overall gas mileage. Some models, like the Toyota Prius, get an average 54 miles per gallon. So while their upfront cost might be higher than a pure gasoline car, hybrids have a much lower cost per mile, and therefore lower refueling costs.
Loser 💸
Internal combustion engine vehicles
Gasoline is usually the more expensive way to fuel a car when compared to an electric battery. ""Electricity has historically been less expensive than gasoline by a significant chunk,"" Goodwin says. The average gasoline car gets 26 miles per gallon, which accounts to a $1,320 annual fuel cost for the average 11,000 miles driven per year.
EVs are also a big winner for lower maintenance costs, which adds a nice bit of savings to their total cost of ownership. Here's how they compare to gasoline cars:
Winner 🏆
Electric vehicles
Whereas gas engines have plenty of things that can break, electric powertrains hardly ever do. ""Typically, it's set it and forget it,"" Goodwin says. (No oil changes, spark plugs or exhaust system here.) That makes EV maintenance costs a lot lower than their gas counterparts. That being said, tires on EVs generally wear faster because the vehicle is heavier. And if you do need to make a significant repair on an EV (say, after a collision), it's generally more expensive because the batteries and technology in an EV are costly to replace.
Runner-up 🥈
Internal combustion engine vehicles
Gasoline cars require a lot more maintenance than electric cars. That's because gasoline engines have a lot more moving parts, and a lot more things that can break, compared to an electric powertrain. Regular oil and fluid changes, plus replacements of brakes and other mechanical parts, can add up to a lot of frequent maintenance costs.
Loser 💸
Hybrid vehicles
Passive hybrid vehicles require basically all of the same maintenance that pure gasoline vehicles do, but maybe less often because the engine runs less of the time. Meanwhile, plug-in hybrids, which have both a full gasoline engine and a hefty electric battery powertrain, are basically the worst of both worlds when it comes to maintenance costs, Dalgaard says.
Insurance is yet another ongoing cost that you just can't avoid -- but different types of cars can mean your policy prices vary wildly.
Insurance costs vary a lot depending on the type of car you own. Here are the general trends for different vehicles:
Winner 🏆
Internal combustion engine vehicles
These usually have the lowest insurance costs, because they're cheaper to replace and repair after collisions.
Runner-up 🥈
Hybrid vehicles
Generally, these cars are more expensive to insure compared to pure gasoline vehicles because they're more expensive to begin with.
Loser 💸
Electric vehicles
These cars are the most expensive to insure because they have the highest sticker price, and because components such as batteries are more expensive to replace, according to Goodwin and Dalgaard.
Depreciation -- or how much your vehicle decreases in value over time -- can have a huge impact on your total cost of ownership. That's because when you go to sell your car, its residual value can make a big difference in how much money you lose in the transaction. 
Here's the breakdown between gasoline and electric cars:
Winner 🏆
Internal combustion engine vehicles
Because gasoline cars have been around for so long, their resale value follows a predictable and well-established depreciation curve. Currently, that usually means gas cars depreciate more slowly than electric cars.
Runner-up 🥈
Hybrid vehicles
These cars have traditionally held their value well due to strong demand and fuel efficiency.
Loser 💸
Electric vehicles
Historically, EVs have experienced higher and faster depreciation than gas vehicles. That's partly because the EV technology improves so quickly (leading to better battery range and faster charging) that older models become undesirable more rapidly (very much like the old iPhone models, Dalgaard says). That said, as the EV market matures, this effect might begin to lessen, Goodwin observes, leading to better resale value for EVs.
I compared the total cost of ownership for the same car in its electric and gas-powered models to highlight the differences.
I did the math with a real example, comparing an electric and gasoline-powered version of the same car: the new 2026 release of the Chevrolet Equinox.
Auto type
Electric vehicles
Gas-powered vehicles
Brand/model/year

$30,495

$43,088
Cost over 10 years
$49,744
$56,994
Cost over 15 years
$57,420
$72,345
Winner: Electric vehicles 🏆
Loser: Internal combustion engine vehicles 💸
Even without the federal government's $7,500 tax credit, EVs can still have a lower total cost of ownership than internal-combustion engine cars.
""In general, you're going to be better off with an EV,"" Dalgaard says. That's because even though EVs have a higher upfront cost, gasoline cars can have more than double the fuel costs, and significantly higher maintenance costs.
Hybrids, meanwhile, probably have an advantage over vehicles with internal combustion engines (due to the improved gas mileage), and offer a good middle ground if you're not ready for an EV.
The best choice for you is also going to depend on your driving habits: How much you drive, how long you plan to keep the car and whether you can charge an EV at home, for example.
""Now you have more of an ability to pick a powertrain that works for you,"" Goodwin says of the current vehicle market.
You should run the numbers yourself using local electricity rates, gas prices and driving patterns. It's complicated, but online calculators like this one from the New York Times can help you make the comparison.

CollectiblesFunko Pop 
Last week, the Funko Pop company hit investors with a dramatic disclosure. “There is substantial doubt about the Companyâs ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months,” it revealed in its latest quarterly earnings report. This is the company warning that it’s at increasing risk of defaulting on its loans. How much is that? Roughly $241 million. I don’t think the banks will accept payment in the form of One Piece Funko Pops.
The company revealed that it amended its credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank back in July in an effort to waive certain requirements and buy time in order to refinance its debt under more manageable terms. That sounds reasonable and the company is certainly spinning this situation as business as usual, but it’s also saying, in no uncertain terms, that there’s a decent chance it won’t be able to pay out everyone it owes by the end of the next 12 months unless something big changes.
“I want to reiterate the sense of urgency and opportunity around our Make Culture Pop strategy, executing across the intersection of culture, creativity, and commerce,” Josh Simon, who just joined as CEO in September after five years at Netflix, said during the latest earnings call. “In the short term, Iâm looking to maintain the momentum [the chief financial officer] discussed.”
He continued, “Over the long term, whatâs most exciting to me, and I hope is equally exciting to our investors, are the multiple opportunities to transform the company for substantial growth. We have a strategic advantage from building this company over the last 27 years, and we intend to leverage that legacy and relationship with our community of fans to take advantage of the huge opportunity in the increasingly global world of entertainment and pop culture fandom.”
Who doesn’t love “multiple opportunities to transform the company for substantial growth”?
But the numbers are bad. Funko Pop lost $1 million last quarter, a harsh drop from the over $8 million in profit it made a year ago. Why is the collectible company tumbling off a cliff? You might think it has something to do with losing certain big licenses to competitors or flooding the market with way more junk than even the most die-hard fans are willing to absorb, but the biggest kiss of death came back in the spring in the form of President Trump’s trade war. Tariffs hit sales of cheap toys manufactured overseas hard.
The company claims that’s all in the past, however, and the new CEO is touting a big anticipated boost from the upcoming releases of Stranger Things‘ final seasonÂ and Wicked: For Good. He was also very proud of Funko’s recent Dodgers Championship Five Pack, which he attributed to the company’s new “quick strike” team that can essentially take any major pop culture event in the world and merchandize it at warp speed.
By far my favorite secret Funko strategy to not go bankrupt is its new Bitty line of mini-figures. That’s right. The company’s brilliant maneuver in its time of distress is just making Funkos smaller and combining them with loot boxes. “We are also planning new innovative retail experiences, such as selling Bitty Pop products through vending machines with a surprise or mystery element to the purchase experience,” the executive team said during the call last week. Inspired!
Will Funko still be around in five years? Will it be be acquired by another toy company or chopped up for parts in a private equity buyout? It’s hard to day. One thing’s for certain, though: the plastic faces it has littered across shelves and landfills will remain with us for decades if not centuries to come.

Strategy has added more Bitcoin to its balance sheet, continuing its accumulation strategy despite recent market volatility. The company now holds 641,692 BTC, valued at approximately $47.5 billion.
The move reaffirms long-term confidence in Bitcoin’s growth potential, but also raises doubts about sustainability. 
Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) continues to strengthen its position as the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder. 
The company announced the purchase of an additional 487 BTC for approximately $49.9 million, at an average price of $102,557 per coin. With this latest acquisition, Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings have climbed to 641,692 BTC.
Strategy has acquired 487 BTC for ~$49.9 million at ~$102,557 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 26.1% YTD 2025. As of 11/9/2025, we hodl 641,692 $BTC acquired for ~$47.54 billion at ~$74,079 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRC $STRD $STRE $STRF $STRK https://t.co/jTEikuB5RY
Strategy’s average purchase price across all holdings stands at $74,079 per Bitcoin. This latest figure represents a 26.1% year-to-date BTC yield in 2025. 
The company’s overall performance highlights its disciplined approach to Bitcoin accumulation.  
However, its latest purchase has raised eyebrows, particularly given the broader volatility in Bitcoin’s performance.
Bitcoin recently slipped below the $100,000 mark in early November, sparking renewed debate about market volatility and the sustainability of corporate Bitcoin investment strategies. 
While some investors viewed the recent correction as a warning sign, Strategy saw it as a buying opportunity. 
The company’s latest purchase came just days after Michael Saylor set a $150,000 year-end target for Bitcoin, doubling down on the conviction that short-term volatility won’t derail the company’s long-term strategy.
On Friday, Strategy also raised $770 million through the issuance of its 10% Series A STRE preferred stock, targeting institutional investors seeking stable returns. The funds raised are being used to support further Bitcoin purchases and general corporate operations.
Still, Strategy’s latest actions come amid heightened uncertainty, with both Bitcoin and MSTR shares facing steep declines. The company’s stock has dropped more than 27% in the past month, closely tracking Bitcoin’s retreat from record highs.
Critics contend that the company’s fortunes are too closely tied to Bitcoin’s price, while supporters view its approach as a strong expression of long-term confidence and value preservation.
Whether Strategy’s bold conviction pays off will depend on Bitcoin’s recovery trajectory and investor sentiment in the months ahead.

73,2025-11-10,"PC building, just like almost everything in life, has some unsaid rules that the community will never cease to remind you of. I've written about the recommended tips for building balanced PCs and ways to avoid bottlenecks on your PC, since that's the ""appropriate"" thing to do. However, many of the so-called rules that we PC builders take to heart are little more than safe generalizations. After building PCs for over 20 years, I've decided that I'm done following the rules I don't really believe in — here are six that I'm starting with. 
I admit I've been guilty of propagating this one ever since I had enough money to buy high-quality components. On my first few builds, I always valued affordability more than anything else, so much so that I often used terrible components that I shudder thinking about now. I've used my fair share of no-name PSUs with questionable construction, but only when I had no choice. Once I was able to invest in quality PSUs, I realized the importance of PSU ratings and durable internals. However, this notion that anything lower than 80+ Gold efficiency is out of the question doesn't sit right with me.
Of course, you should consider buying high-quality PSUs if you have the budget to spare — after all, you're spending a few extra dollars to safeguard thousands of dollars of sensitive hardware. That said, efficiency alone doesn't tell the complete story. PSU quality depends on the construction, tolerances, and quality-of-life features. A Bronze-rated power supply from a reliable manufacturer can beat a Gold-rated one from an unknown brand hands down. You should consult third-party reviews, PSU tier lists, and Reddit accounts to form a complete picture of a PSU's overall quality. 
The MSI MAG A750BN is a PCIe 5.0, 750W, Bronze-rated power supply for budget PCs that need the ability to upgrade to more powerful GPUs and CPUs in the future.
This one is a bit divisive, but I believe most of you will agree with me that perfecting your cable management isn't as essential as it's made out to be. Sure, cable management is important to an extent — you don't want to mess up your airflow with a jungle of cables dangling around inside the case. Even from an esthetic and convenience perspective, doing a good job of routing the cables during a build will reap dividends down the line. However, the pressure from the community is often unnecessary.
No one is willingly making a mess out of the cable situation on a new build. Most PC builders make a genuine effort to dot the i's and cross the t's as far as the bulk of the cable management process is concerned. Once they've routed the largest cables correctly and neatly, stuffing a few other cables haphazardly in an invisible corner of the case isn't such a big deal. As long as undue pressure isn't threatening the integrity of the cables, it's not going to make any difference to the performance or safety of the build. Perfect cable management is one of the things I never stress about when I'm building a PC.
I understand the apprehension toward pre-owned components — you can't be 100% sure there will be zero issues going forward. Plus, there are times when used PC parts are simply a bad idea. However, to completely write them off is to your own detriment. The used PC hardware market is home to many great deals and genuine sellers simply moving on to newer hardware. To be safe, you can avoid buying some components used, such as storage drives, motherboards, and ancient power supplies. CPUs, GPUs, RAM, fans, and cases are fair game, though.
The used market is often the only refuge for people who can't afford today's overpriced components. You can not only get older-gen, high-end components at a great price, but sometimes that's the only option available — think anemic stocks and scalpers. Besides, there are more than enough ways to protect yourself before buying used components, such as asking for proof of purchase, inspecting for physical damage, and running stress tests (if possible). If you buy from sites like eBay, buyer protection policies will ensure you don't get scammed by faulty products. It's time to embrace used PC hardware with open arms. 
There are enough thermal paste myths to fill up an article — oh wait! This is one of the areas where more money doesn't give you an equivalent increase in quality or performance. The stock thermal paste that you find pre-applied on your cooler heatsink might not be as good as one from Noctua or Thermal Grizzly, but it's not worthless either. The stock thermal paste has come a long way over the years, and it's more than enough to keep your CPU or GPU cool for years. Even if you want to replace it when re-installing your cooler, a budget aftermarket paste is still a better buy than a fancy alternative.
Numerous tests have shown that the brand of thermal paste you buy almost doesn't matter. Of course, you might see a 4℃ drop in maximum temperature, but is that going to make a difference to your PC's performance, noise levels, or longevity? Both your stock and budget thermal paste are going to last 2–4 years without any issues — you should repaste your cooler once every 2–3 years anyway. So, stop being gaslighted into wasting money on expensive thermal paste, and focus on optimizing your PC's airflow, which will yield bigger benefits. 
The Arctic MX-6 is the direct successor to the popular MX-5 thermal paste solution. It's promised to deliver an uplift of 20% in thermal performance with increased viscosity. If you want the best overall thermal solution for your CPU, this is it.
The advice that one should always prefer a clean Windows install on a new build does have validity. The reason is that if you clone an existing Windows installation to a new SSD or just use your old SSD with new hardware, you could introduce some weird errors. Modern operating systems, however, are more adept at handling hardware swaps. So, your old copy of Windows will work just fine with your new CPU, GPU, motherboard, etc.
Another concern is carrying over any issues present on the old installation. For instance, undetected malware, registry conflicts, and underlying OS corruption can cause problems on your new PC. However, it doesn't have to be this way. Even without a fresh Windows install, you can ensure your old copy works just fine on your new hardware. You just need to run a deep malware scan, and fix any file corruptions with scans like SFC and DISM.
I'm still using the Windows 10 installation that I started with back in 2017, having cloned it to my new SSD in 2022. I've not faced any issues that I could attribute to the old setup. Any problems that have persisted on my Windows 10 installation also existed before migrating to the new PC. A clean Windows install gives you a fresh start, but if you can't be bothered to do it, cloning it and moving on isn't a big deal at all.
As I said earlier, PC building advice often boils down to generalizations, but the one-size-fits-all approach doesn't always work. For instance, recommending every PC builder to maximize performance per dollar at the cost of esthetics or nice-to-haves doesn't often fly. People don't build PCs for functionality or value alone; they also crave creative expression and hardware that ""feels"" nice. Metrics like FPS per dollar fail to take into account other intangible aspects of a build, which every PC builder decides for themselves. 
Splurging on an overkill motherboard, high-end graphics card, or OLED monitor may not be ""smart"" decisions, but they're not meaningless either. If a Gen5 SSD, fancy case, or AIO liquid cooler makes one happy, what's the harm in indulging oneself? Of course, you shouldn't go out of your way to buy stuff you can't realistically afford, but otherwise, spending more than what's ""necessary"" on a PC is a personal choice. Of course, I can easily share my opinion on the right budget for a modern PC, but again, that's a generalization that doesn't apply to everyone. 
The so-called rules of PC building might have stood for a long time, but they fly out the window when you dig a little deeper. If you're prepared to get your hands dirty if things go slightly off course, most of these rules don't apply to you. You can build a great PC without adhering to value, safety, and esthetic rules. I'm done sticking to outdated advice and limiting ""tips"" that keep me chained to a build that's technically right but doesn't ""feel"" right to me.
We want to hear from you! Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful.
Your comment has not been saved

As a person that works in a returns department for a PC builder for many years, this article is quite statistically incorrect. I do take your point about a gold unknown brand won't be as good as a bronze reliable brand, but let me tell you - there are also gold power supplies from good brands, and also platinum ones too. Bronze ones fail more., simply. 

When a return comes in, there are some power supplies you check first, and some power supplies you just know it's not going to be that that is causing the issue since you've never seen one of them fail yet. Good brands, good parts = good computing. 

All of those device drivers on your old Intel and Nvidia setup... Reusing Windows on your new AMD rig with different cost, USB controller, bus, etc. you are asking for trouble. It could be as little as clutter. It could be a micro micro stutter in a game, slowness, or outright instability. The first thing any support tech will tell you it's wipe the disk and install fresh Windows. This one is just bad advice from the author. 

The other items I can let you go on. Thermals are better with good paste but for a home user to buy a whole tube of the stuff for a pea sized amount? Not worth it unless doing something extreme. Best to option it when you get your PC built from the PC builder of you can then you are only paying for the ""squirt"", not the tube. 

Cable management is subjective, unless in a tightly compact SFF computer it does nothing other than make it look like you knew what you were doing. 
Used hardware is fine, just be aware that scum bags will try to offload their ""working mostly but crashes occasionally"" kit instead of owning up to it. Easier to sell than to hassle with RMAs

Relying on reviews is foolish.  Reviews are where you find upset people and trolls. If you read a review you should just assume that it's false, paid for  (most good reviews are bought) or just out right trolling. "

A broader stock market rally on Monday, fueled by eight Senate Democrats siding with Republicans to back a deal that would end the government shutdown, added tens of billions of dollars to the fortunes of the world’s richest people. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 237 points (0.5%), while the S&P 500 added 1.2% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq surged 2.01% as of Monday afternoon.
Nasdaq’s rise was largely fueled by Nvidia, whose shares rose 4.4% to around $196, with additional gains from Alphabet’s Class C shares (up 3.2%), Tesla (4.3%), Meta (2%) and Palantir (8.4%).
The Dow, also boosted by Nvidia, rose with gains posted by Amazon (1.6%), Cisco (0.9%), Apple (0.5%), Goldman Sachs (1.2%) and JPMorgan Chase (1%).
A broader rally follows a Senate vote late Sunday, in which eight Democrats sided with Republicans to approve a procedural vote on a legislative deal that would fund most federal agencies through January, allowing a vote on the deal later Monday. 
Tesla’s stock rise added $10.1 billion to CEO Elon Musk’s estimated net worth on Monday, increasing the world’s largest individual fortune to $492.3 billion, ranking Musk ahead of No. 2 Larry Ellison, whose net worth jumped $2.8 billion to $296.4 billion. An uptick in Amazon shares bumped No. 3 Jeff Bezos up $1.9 billion to $256.4 billion, while No. 4 Larry Page ($236 billion) and No. 5 Sergey Brin ($218.9 billion) added $5.7 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively, as Alphabet’s shares increased. No. 6 Mark Zuckerberg ($217.1 billion) added $3.8 billion to his net worth as Meta shares rose, and No. 7 Bernard Arnault, whose LVMH is not traded in the U.S., had his fortune rise to $184.2 billion after gaining $4.1 billion. No. 8 Jensen Huang’s net worth increased $6.1 billion to $169.5 billion with Nvidia leading the broader market rally, and an uptick for Microsoft’s stock added $0.8 billion to No. 9 Steve Ballmer’s fortune ($151.5 billion). No. 10 Warren Buffett ($149.4 billion) benefited from the broader gains, earning $0.3 billion."

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jo Baker, founder and CEO of ShipperHQ. It has been edited for length and clarity.
Before my husband and I had kids, we agreed that he would be a stay-at-home parent, since I was the breadwinner. I was working in tech for a media company in London, earning a decent income for a comfortable lifestyle. We took the kids to Fiji for vacation and enrolled my son in private school.
My husband, who was bored at home with the kids, started an eBay business. It was really more of a hobby and didn't make much money, but there were issues with shipping. I created software that helped solve those challenges and made it available for free. Soon, my program had thousands of downloads, and people were asking me to help solve their specific shipping challenges.
One day, while taking the train to work, I ran the math. If I could make £100 a day, I could get by. I called my husband and said, ""I'm handing in my notice."" He told me I was nuts.
It took me a long while to replace my salary, but the business grew steadily. My safety net was knowing that I could always go back to corporate if I needed to. Luckily, I didn't.
In 2013, I immigrated to the US because that's where the majority of the business was. It wasn't glamorous: the first year we moved to the US, I had $68 to spend on Christmas presents after I paid everyone else. There have been many times when we've had to reinvent and discard what we've created; that's happening now as we adapt to AI.
Doing that has helped us grow. Today, ShipperHQ is based in Austin, where we have 47 employees. Last year, we did about $15 million in revenue.
When people think about a tech CEO based in Austin, they don't picture me. I'm a 53-year-old mom. My working-class English accent sounds more like the 1980s gangsta film ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" than ""Downton Abbey.""
Over time, I've become sick of justifying the fact that I don't fit the mold. I want to show that you don't have to look or sound how people expect. The success of my company speaks for itself.
I've always been chasing a feeling of financial security. My mom died from cancer when I was 22. After that, I went into debt and had to scramble just to make ends meet.
My mom's death still impacts me 30 years later. I assumed I'd be dead by 50, like her. Because of that, I wanted to create stability for my sons. If I died, I wanted them to be able to stand on their own two feet without me. That's what drove me as a business owner.
In 2021, I felt financially safe for the first time. The pandemic increased the business revenue. More importantly, I started to truly trust myself. It took only 12 years, but I have finally come to believe in the decision I made as a business leader.
That safety gave me the confidence to enjoy life now, without the constant scramble for growth. I didn't want my teenage sons to move out without feeling like I'd really enjoyed them.
While I wanted my kids to have more than I had, I was also very afraid of destroying them by giving them too much. I believe money is a very powerful and potentially dangerous thing.
I started working with a wealth counselor a few years ago. She has helped the entire family process their feelings about wealth. She's become like a grandmother to my kids and has helped us reframe our thoughts. There's a lot to unwrap there, and it's very personal. However, it manifests in subtle ways. For example, when I'm grocery shopping with my kids, they still need to ask before putting something in the cart so I can purchase it. And I'll always prefer a dive bar over a swanky restaurant.
I want to show my sons the world without overindulging them. This year, we're going back to Fiji, just like the vacation we took with them when they were little. The difference is that this time, they'll understand what I had to do to earn this.

80,2025-11-10,"A nine-year-old boy and five women were killed in the ramming attack in a busy market.
By News Agencies

A court in southeastern Germany is set to open the trial of a Saudi Arabian doctor who is suspected of carrying out a ramming attack last year.
Taleb al-Abdulmohsen, a 51-year-old psychiatrist, will appear in court on Monday in the town of Magdeburg, accused of killing six people and wounding more than 300 when he drove a van into a busy Christmas market last December.
The defendant has been charged with six murders, the attempted murder of another 338 people, and committing a “treacherous attack”. The victims killed included a nine-year-old boy and five women aged 45 to 75.
Because of the large number of victims, a hall has been prepared as a special court that will be able to seat all participants, who are believed to include more than 140 co-plaintiffs and 400 witnesses.
The suspect, who has expressed antipathy towards Islam and sympathy with far-right politics, will be seated in a bullet-proof booth amid a heavy presence by German security forces.
Al-Abdulmohsen, who arrived to live in Germany in 2006, has been in custody since the day of the crime on December 20, 2024, faces life imprisonment for murder if found guilty.
According to prosecutors, al-Abdulmohsen was not under the influence of alcohol or other substances and “acted out of dissatisfaction and frustration over the course and outcome of a civil dispute and the failure of various criminal complaints”.
He has described himself as a “Saudi atheist” and an activist who is critical of Islam.
Abdulmohsen’s online activities also included criticism of Germany for accepting too many Muslim refugees and backing for conspiracy theories about the “Islamisation” of Europe. He has expressed support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.
Despite that, the AfD held a “memorial” rally at the scene of the attack, stating that the “terror” arriving in Magdeburg must be halted.
Co-leader Alice Weidel also referred to Abdulmohsen as an “Islamist” as she spoke at the rally. Such rhetoric has helped the far-right party gain prominence in Germany.
Following the attack, security services faced uncomfortable questions about whether it could have been prevented, given Abdulmohsen’s history of extreme rhetoric and violent threats.

84,2025-11-10,"The rapid rise in Quality Control Orders (QCOs) over the past five years, the majority of which have impacted raw material intermediate products, instead of finished goods, has not only harmed the competitiveness of the Indian industry but has also disproportionately affected small industries, leading to market concentration, according to an internal NITI Aayog report that is yet to be made public.
The report by the High-Level Committee on Non-Financial Reforms, which has not yet been made public, states that the rapid expansion of quality standards from 70 to 790 in nine years has resulted in “supply chain disruptions, increased input costs and production delays for the downstream industry.”
Recommending the revocation of QCOs on synthetic fibres, plastics and polymers, base metals, and some inputs for the footwear and electronics sectors, the report suggested that the Ministry of Steel suspend QCOs on steel product lines covering raw materials and intermediates, while retaining norms for construction and pressure-vessel categories.
Export competitiveness hurt due to QCOs
The report said that the Steel Import Monitoring System (SIMS) and No Objection Certificate (NOC) process for grades of steel not covered under BIS should be revoked, as existing mechanisms are already available with the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), the designated nodal agency for monitoring exports and imports.
The Indian Express on January 27 this year reported that QCOs — spanning metals and textiles to chemicals and energy — are resulting in market concentration among large companies at the cost of MSMEs, as the latter face higher costs as downstream users across sectors.
On November 27 last year, this paper reported that the Embassy of Japan in India had raised concerns with two central ministries — the Ministry of Steel and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry — stating that Japanese steel consignments were being held up at Indian ports by Customs officials due to the absence of a No Objection Certificate (NOC).
“MSMEs have been among the most affected due to the imposition of QCOs, as they often face financial and logistical challenges in meeting the associated certification, testing, and factory inspection requirements. Testing backlogs at BIS-approved laboratories can extend over several months, while the cost of obtaining and renewing licences may be prohibitive for small enterprises operating with limited margins,” the report said.
Indicating that the domestic industry has paid a heavier price for QCOs compared to units in SEZs, the report said, “Unlike exporters located in SEZs, MSMEs operating in the domestic tariff area (DTA) with mixed domestic and export portfolios often lack access to exempted import channels, thereby reducing their competitiveness in both domestic and international markets.”
Market concentration due to QCOs
Niti Aayog pointed out that due to challenges faced by global suppliers in obtaining BIS certification, the implementation of QCOs has, in effect, led to “greater concentration among domestic suppliers in some sectors, giving them the ability to raise prices above global levels”.
“For instance, polyester fibre, yarn, and some steel products command 15–30 per cent price premiums over global benchmarks, affecting the cost competitiveness of downstream industries in the international market. This is one of the main reasons for India’s declining share in global apparel exports despite the withdrawal of anti-dumping duties on select products,” the report said.
The report further noted that in several product categories, finished goods are already regulated through established safety or performance standards, but QCOs have also been extended to cover the inputs used in their production.
“This dual application of QCOs — at both the input and finished goods stages — is particularly evident in sectors such as steel, copper, aluminium, and polyester value chains. This duplication not only increases administrative burden but also creates potential ambiguities regarding prevailing standards, thereby adding to the uncertainty faced by both domestic producers and importers,” the report said.

In a video, a group of men can be seen offering namaz just outside the gate of Terminal 2 at KIA as a team of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) stands nearby.

Blood, sweat, tears, and great team members.
That's what it takes to launch a brand new hotel, Marriott International's chief commercial officer, John Toomey, told Business Insider.
""The most difficult job for a hotelier is opening a hotel from zero, where you don't have one guest in your hotel,"" Toomey said.
Toomey joined Marriott International in 1996 and has been with the hospitality giant for nearly three decades. In his current role, he oversees over 650 hotels run by Marriott in the Asia Pacific, excluding China.
""When you're starting something from zero, you really feel it,"" Toomey said. ""It takes great leadership. It takes great team members. It takes everybody coming together to make that hotel a success.""
""It's not just the day the hotel opens. It's the six to nine to 12 months leading up to it, from getting the hotel staffing ready to go and selling your heart out,"" he continued.
Toomey said the job gets easier once a hotel chain has secured a foothold in a foreign market and has started to build up branding.
He added that customer loyalty programs such as Marriott Bonvoy have made it easier for hoteliers to expand their presence. As of 2024, Marriott Bonvoy had nearly 228 million members worldwide.
""Now that we have such a deep loyalty program, we are in a better position to open hotels than when I was opening hotels 25 years ago,"" Toomey said.
""I opened the first four hotels we had in India. Opening those was probably a lot more challenging than the nearly 160 hotels we have there now,"" he added.
In June, Kwon Ping Ho, the founder and executive chair of the luxury hotel chain Banyan Group, told Business Insider that ""the worst business to be in is hospitality.""
""It is so management-intensive. It is so time and people-intensive, and it is so vulnerable to event risk,"" Ho said.
Ho said running a hotel chain effectively is all about building a working culture that prioritizes the customer in everything it does.
""You go to a hotel. You forget about the 10 good experiences you have. One screw-up, you will never forget. People are not very forgiving about screw-ups,"" Ho said.
It's not just hospitality. Business leaders across sectors have also talked about how difficult it is to launch a new venture.
Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, told Khan Academy founder Sal Khan in a 2013 interview that creating companies is not as fun as people think.
""There are periods of fun, and there are periods where it's just awful. Particularly if you are the CEO of the company, you actually have a distillation of all the worst problems in the company,"" Musk said.
""I think you have to feel quite compelled to do it, and have a fairly high pain threshold,"" he added.
Jensen Huang, the founder and CEO of the chip giant Nvidia, said in an October 2023 interview on the ""Acquired"" podcast that ""nobody in their right mind"" would start a company from scratch.
""Building a company and building Nvidia turned out to have been a million times harder than I expected it to be,"" Huang said.
""If we realized the pain and suffering and just how vulnerable you're going to feel, and the challenges that you're going to endure, the embarrassment and the shame, and the list of all the things that go wrong, I don't think anybody would start a company,"" he added.

The legal profession is facing disruption, and its newest recruits are on the front lines.
On Friday, Latham & Watkins packed its first-year associate class, more than 400 lawyers in total, into a Washington, D.C., hotel for a mandatory two-day ""AI Academy."" The firm laid out how partners already use tools like Harvey, an OpenAI-backed legal tech startup, and Microsoft Copilot. It also brought in outside voices, including Meta's top privacy lawyer, Steve Satterfield.
It was all a not-so-subtle cue that artificial intelligence isn't optional, but part of the firm's standard operating procedure. The Big Law firm hit $7 billion in revenue last year, making it the second-highest-grossing firm in the US, and employs over 3,500 lawyers globally.
Latham partner Michael Rubin, who represents tech clients in high-stakes litigation and regulatory fights, says the firm is eyeing AI as a ""generational opportunity"" to equip all of its lawyers with the most advanced tools and provide clients better, more efficient service.
""Turning away from it as opposed to embracing is just not an option,"" Rubin told Business Insider from Washington on Saturday. ""We are going to run as fast as we can toward it.""
The routine legal work often handed to associates — think legal research, citation checks, and first drafts — is exactly the type of task that firms can automate with software. The job-market anxiety is real. Many believe that law firms will need fewer associates to drive profits even higher, and in-house legal teams are already exploring ways to reduce head count.
The global firm is pitching a win-win. It trains associates to use the tools that boost revenue and client service, and those early-career lawyers stay relevant as the nature of their work changes.
Over the weekend, Rubin encouraged associates to seize the ""powerful new tool"" in their kit.
""It's a revolution that we're all experiencing,"" Rubin told Business Insider. ""It doesn't change the fundamental point that at Latham, we provide the best client service and that means ensuring that the work product that goes out the door is always exceptional.""
Across Big Law, client pressure has turned curiosity into urgency. In-house counsel want efficiency gains and are asking law firms about their AI plans. Firms are now racing to pilot and roll out software to automate mundane tasks. Results are mixed.
This spring, a Latham lawyer defending Anthropic in a copyright lawsuit made headlines after an expert's testimony cited an article that does not exist. The lawyer said the mistake stemmed from using Anthropic's own chatbot, Claude, which fabricated an article title and authors.
Adam Ziegler, who leads Latham's AI strategy, pushed firmwide adoption while also stressing the importance of personal responsibility. Lawyers are expected to ""review the output of the tools they have"" and to ""keep their hands on the wheel,"" Ziegler told Business Insider.
This was Latham's second run of the AI Academy and the first time it was offered to first-year associates across global offices. Senior lawyers walked through actual cases that were sped up by using AI. Junior litigators participated in breakout sessions on relevant tools, while young corporate attorneys discussed how the tech is transforming the way clients do business.
Fiona Maclean, a longtime Latham partner and vice chair of the technology and AI practices, says the training will continue long after the weekend academy. It runs structured training programs for different associate years and offers skills training on a rolling basis. Rubin says the firm is also developing a virtual AI Academy for lawyers of any experience level, launching early next year.
Rubin says he doesn't believe the tech will cannibalize opportunities for junior attorneys.
""We think this is an opportunity for lawyers to step up,"" Rubin said, ""and do more engaging work, more strategic work — the very work that clients turn to Latham to do.""

Here are my recommendations, covering multiple product categories, price points, and more. 
Updated November 10, 2025: Updated pricing and availability details, added new information on the ASUS ProArt Display 6K and the LG UltraFine 6K. 
You can’t have a roundup of the best displays on the market without mentioning Apple’s Studio Display. While it’s on the pricier side of things, it features a beautiful Apple design with a 27-inch 5K display. You’ll also find one Thunderbolt 3 port for connecting your Mac, along with three bonus USB-C ports.
The Studio Display is available in multiple configurations at various different prices which I’ve highlighted below. If you’re looking for an iMac-like experience with your Mac, there’s no better option than the Apple Studio Display.
Apple is reportedly planning to release a new Studio Display sometime during the first half of 2026. There aren’t any rumors about what to expect from that update. Nonetheless, I’d recommend looking for a deal on the current Studio Display to avoid paying full price for something that could soon be outdated.

The LG UltraFine 6K has been highly-anticipated ever since LG teased it back at CES in January. The display promised an affordable alternative to Apple’s Studio Display and Pro Display XDR. 
It offers a 32-inch panel with a resolution of 6144 x 3456 pixels. It has a bevy of ports. Here are the important specs: 
Here’s where to buy the LG UltraFine 6K 
My colleague Jeff Benjamin just went hands-on with this one, and it caught my attention right away. The Asus ProArt (PA27JCV) Display 5K yields the same 5K resolution (5120×2880) in a similar 27-inch form factor to the Studio Display, but at half the price.
Watch Jeff’s full review above for all the details. If you’re in the market for a 5K display for your Mac, it’s hard to beat the Asus ProArt. 
Here’s where to buy the Asus ProArt Display 5K: 
If you’re looking for something bigger and higher-resolution, Asus has you covered. The new Asus ProArt Display 6K (PA32QCV) is a 32-inch display with a native resolution of 6016 x 3384. My colleague Jeff called it a “ridiculously good value” in his review. 
Perhaps the best thing about the ASUS ProArt 6K Display is its price. It costs $1,300, which makes it substantially cheaper than some of the most popular 4K and 5K displays on the market.
Here’s where to buy the ASUS ProArt 6K display: 
Samsung’s ViewFinity S9 5K is another compelling option to pair with your new Mac, and it’s also far cheaper than Apple’s Studio Display. In fact, it’s currently on sale for $999.99.
It features a matte display that can reduce light reflections and distractions. There’s also a clever modular 4K camera built-in. It has one Thunderbolt 4 port for connecting your Mac, as well as a Mini DisplayPort and three USB-C ports.
The Samsung ViewFinity S9 5K can also double as a smart display with built-in streaming apps and other features powered by the company’s Tizen OS.
Here’s where to buy the Samsung ViewFinity S9 5K:
Read more in our full review: Samsung ViewFinity S9 5K display – a good Apple Studio Display competitor
This might be my favorite option on this list at the moment. The BenQ PD2730S 27″ 5K Monitor packs a wide array of Mac-friendly features, headlined of course by the crisp 5K resolution.

This is one of the most compelling options if you’re looking for a 32-inch display for your new Mac for under $1000. BenQ makes some of our favorite Mac accessories. The big downside to this one, however, is that you’re “only” getting 4K resolution instead of 5K resolution. However, it features an abundance of ports options and a sub $1,000 price point for a 32-inch panel.
Here’s where to buy the BenQ 32-inch 4K PD3225U Thunderbolt Monitor:

Another affordable 4K option comes from Samsung with the Viewfinity S80TB, packing Thunderbolt connectivity and a 27-inch panel.
Here’s where to buy the Samsung Viewfinity S80TB:
If you’re looking to pair your Mac with an ultrawide display, the Dell U4025QW is one of the best options on the market. It features a 5K resolution and 120Hz refresh rate packed into a 40-inch display. There’s also a vast array of ports, a matte screen finish, and more.
Here’s where to buy the Dell U4025QW 40-inch Ultrawide:
A more affordable way to enter the ultrawide display market is the Samsung ViewFinity S65TC, which is currently on sale for nearly half off. It doesn’t pack all of the bells and whistles as other options, but you still get a 34-inch ultrawide curved display and a plethora of ports, including one Thunderbolt 4 port with power delivery.
Here’s where to buy the Samsung ViewFinity S65TC:
These are just some of the best options for external displays to pair with your new Mac. They all offer excellent macOS integration, an abundance of connectivity options, and unique sizes and form factors.

Tablets have become essential tools for everything from streaming shows to taking notes in meetings but finding one that delivers premium performance without premium pricing remains a challenge. Apple dominates the tablet market because of the tight ecosystem integration and refined hardware; the 11-inch iPad with the A16 chip is the most affordable entry point into that experience. Currently priced at $299 on Amazon after its standard $349 retail price, this 2025 WiFi 128GB model delivers the core iPad experience at the lowest this configuration has ever reached. Apple’s own website still sells this exact model at full price, which makes Amazon’s discount genuinely noteworthy.
See at Amazon
The A16 chip powering this iPad comes straight from Apple’s iPhone lineage and brings smartphone-class efficiency and processing power to tablet computing. This processor nudges along multiple running apps with ease: You seamlessly flip between Safari tabs, respond to messages, edit photos, and stream video without the sluggish performance that plagues cheaper Android tablets. The neural engine within the A16 Bionic greatly accelerates machine learning tasks, including photo recognition, voice processing and augmented reality applications.
The 11-inch Liquid Retina display strikes an ideal balance between portability and usable screen space. The 2360 x 1640 resolution delivers sharp text that remains readable even at smaller font sizes, making this iPad viable for extended reading sessions or document work. True Tone technology automatically adjusts the color temperature in the display based on the surrounding lightÂ and reduces eye strain when you move from bright outdoor environments into warm indoor lighting.
The camera system is actually far better than what most would expect from tablet cameras: The 12MP rear camera captures surprisingly good photos and 4K video, making this iPad capable of documenting events, scanning documents, or recording video content when your phone isn’t handy. The front 12MP camera, finally situated in a landscape orientation, puts the lens where it should be for video calls, centering you in frame when the iPad sits naturally on a desk or in a stand.
The 128GB of storage handles normal use patterns without requiring constant file management. You can have a good library of Netflix shows downloaded for offline viewing, store thousands of photos, install dozens of apps, and keep important documents locally accessible. Of course, cloud storage integration through iCloud allows you to easily expand beyond local storage for files you don’t need immediate access to. Having 128GB on board eliminates the anxiety that comes with 64GB models, which fill up frustratingly fast. This capacity hits that sweet spot whereby most users never feel constrained but aren’t paying extra for storage they’ll never use.
WiFi 6 connectivity itself offers faster wireless speeds and better performance in crowded networks compared with older WiFi standards which makes a noticeable difference when you download large files, stream high-resolution video, or use the iPad in environments with many competing devices on the same network. Furthermore, the increased efficiency means better battery life on network-intensive tasks as the WiFi 6 radio can transmit data faster and return to low-power states more quickly.
The iPad is better integrated into the ecosystem of Apple devices, and creates great continuity between them. You can start typing something in an email on your iPad and then just finish it on your iPhone or Mac. Or copy text or an image on one and paste it into another using Universal Clipboard, start something on one device and pick it up where you left off with Handoff. It works so transparently that you stop thinking about which device you’re using and focus instead on what you’re trying to accomplish.
A rating of 4.8 out of 5 stars based on over 12,000 reviews shows real end-user satisfaction in this iPad’s performance and reliability. That feedback comes from real buyers who use the device daily, providing confidence that the experience matches Apple’s promises.
At $299, this is Apple’s most accessible premium tablet offering to date, and bringss the iPad experience within reach of buyers who previously considered it too expensive.

Picture the typical launch cycle for a new folding knife. The company teases a product on Instagram, drops some specs, maybe partners with a YouTube reviewer or two. Enthusiasts argue about blade steel and lock mechanisms in comment sections. Someone complains about the price. Someone else points out the handle color options are boring. Launch day arrives, and the knife goes out into the world exactly as the manufacturer intended, sealed behind screws most buyers will never touch. Months later, modders start posting custom scale builds, aftermarket clips, and anodizing projects. The manufacturer either ignores this entirely or, in some cases, sends cease-and-desist letters.
Vosteed took one look at that cycle and designed a knife that skips straight to the modding phase. The Vosteed Vombat arrives as something closer to a platform than a finished product, complete with swappable scales, adjustable internals, and a construction system so deliberately user-friendly that all the body screws use the same T8 driver. They even provide the 3D files for printing custom scales, turning what’s usually a gray-market activity into an official feature. Pair that openness with a 2.92-inch M390 blade and a patent-pending Ball Roll Bar crossbar lock, and you have a knife that refuses to choose between performance and personalization.

It’s a hell of a gamble, trusting your customers not to mess things up. Most brands are terrified of this, preferring a locked-down ecosystem where they control every aspect of the user experience. Vosteed is basically handing over the keys to the kingdom, admitting that their vision ends where yours begins. This transforms the Vombat from a static object into a dynamic project. It’s a brave move that says more about their confidence in the EDC community than any slick marketing campaign could. But it also raises the stakes. An open platform is only as good as its foundation, so the core knife has to be absolutely dialed in from the factory.


And deliver it does. The whole thing is built around their Swappable Adjustable Scale, or SAS, system. This is the beating heart of the Vombat. Sure, you can swap the slick, CNC-textured aluminum scales for aftermarket kits in G10 or micarta, or go wild with your own 3D-printed designs. The real magic, though, is under the hood. You can actually tweak the crossbar’s omega spring tension using clever little “music note” indicators on the liners, letting you dial in the perfect action. There’s even a dedicated service hole that gives you access to the pivot for fine-tuning blade centering without having to perform the dreaded full takedown. This is the kind of obsessive-level tuning that knife nerds live for, and it’s all part of the stock package.

A tinkerer’s dream is a user’s nightmare if the knife itself can’t cut worth a damn. Vosteed knows this, which is why the Vombat is rocking a 2.92-inch blade made from Bohler M390, a super-steel that holds an edge forever and laughs at corrosion. You get two blade shapes to choose from: a classic, clip-point Bowie and a beefy Zulu spearpoint for more demanding utility work. They’ve also milled in their signature dual jimping, one set on the spine for your thumb and another up front for when you need to choke up for detail work. It’s one of those tiny ergonomic details that feels incredibly right once you use it, making the knife feel both secure and nimble.

Even the crossbar lock, which is everywhere these days, gets a thoughtful upgrade. Vosteed noticed that some crossbar locks can develop a bit of grit or stick over time, so they developed what they call a Ball Roll Bar. It’s a tiny, polished sphere at the heart of the mechanism designed to make the action smoother and more reliable over thousands of deployments. That’s the kind of obsessive detail that separates a good design from a great one. They didn’t just copy a popular feature; they identified a point of friction and engineered an elegant, almost invisible, solution.


So what we have here is not just another knife release. The Vombat is a premium folder built like a kit car. It gives you a fantastic M390 engine, a cleverly refined chassis with that Ball Roll Bar lock, and then invites you to build the rest of it exactly how you want. Everything from the single T8 screw size to the etch-friendly wire clip plate is designed to be pulled apart and personalized. With the current 40% launch discount bringing the price down to $119, it’s a no-brainer for anyone who’s ever looked at their EDC and thought, “I could make this better.” I’m genuinely stoked to see the weird, wonderful things people do with this knife.
