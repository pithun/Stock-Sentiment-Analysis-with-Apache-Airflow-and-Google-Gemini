 Nvidia is set to report its latest quarterly results after the closing bell Wednesday, with traders expecting a big move in the AI chipmaker's stock.

 Options pricing suggests traders expect Nvidia (NVDA) shares could move nearly 7% in either direction by the end of the week. A move of that size from Monday's close near $187 could help the shares recover some of their recent losses to return to last week's levels around $199, or pull them down to about $174, a level not seen since September.

 In recent quarters, Nvidia's earnings have tended to be a sell-the-news event, despite a string of record-breaking results. In all but one of the most-recent four quarters, the chipmaker's stock finished the week lower than its levels heading into the event.

 With expectations riding high ahead of the earnings, and results from rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and other AI favorites indicating investors may be harder to impress this season, Nvidia could face an increasingly difficult bar to clear.

This year's big rally in AI stocks, which made Nvidia the world's most valuable public company by market capitalization, has fueled worries about an AI bubble, and investors will be watching closely whether the chipmaker can deliver on its ambitious growth targets. Nvidia's earnings release is the most highly anticipated event of the earnings season, and it's likely to have a big impact on the broader stock market.
 Nvidia is seen reporting adjusted third-quarter earnings per share of $1.26 on a nearly 60% year-over-year jump in revenue to a record $55.4 billion, according to estimates collected by Visible Alpha.

 Whisper numbers could be even higher, with analysts from Jefferies and Wedbush telling clients recently that they expect the AI darling to ""beat and raise,"" or top analysts' quarterly projections as well as lift its full-year outlook.

 Still, Wall Street analysts are widely bullish Nvidia's stock has room to rise after a nearly 40% gain in 2025 so far. All but one of the 13 analysts with current ratings compiled by Visible Alpha call it a ""buy,"" with their mean target near $219 suggesting roughly 17% upside from Monday's close.

 Shares of Nvidia slid about 2% Monday amid broader tech sector losses.

Taiwan has a new manual for times of crisis and war, and it's making sure that everyone receives one.
The local national defense ministry said on Tuesday that it was sending 11 million copies of the new handbook, which was revealed in September, to all households across the island.
The self-governed island is home to roughly 23.3 million people.
Taipei first published a civil defense handbook in 2022, then expanded it in 2023. Countries such as Finland, Sweden, and Lithuania have also released similar guides amid concerns about a potential war with Russia.
But Taiwan's new edition features a revamped style with graphics and simple tips catering toward the wider public. It's also the first year that Taiwan is launching a massive mailing campaign to distribute the handbooks.
While the 2025 National Public Safety Guide did not specifically name mainland China, Taiwan's de facto military concern, as a threat, maps and posited scenarios in the book strongly suggest aggression from Beijing as a key concern.
Such guides also cover disasters such as nuclear accidents or earthquakes, but offer specific insight into how militaries around the world expect civilian populations to prepare for urban conflict.
Here's what Taiwan's new handbook teaches its people about war at home.
The handbook begins by asking readers to consider key logistics in the event that Taiwan comes under threat.
These include:
The handbook advises maintaining a rolling stockpile of supplies that can last for at least one week. This means that households would consume food and necessities from their stockpile while regularly replenishing it, rather than buying only what they need at present.
The items that Taiwan recommends include:
A go-bag is a pack of easily transportable necessities that households have on standby in case they need to flee quickly.
Taiwan's suggestions for a standard go-bag include:
This year's edition listed several specific hostile or sabotage scenarios, going into more detail than previous versions. While these do not mention China, they were accompanied by a map of China's southeastern seaboard and the Taiwan Strait.
The listed threats are:
Taiwan's previous handbook came with identifiers for military uniforms from mainland China's People's Liberation Army and the island's Republic of China Armed Forces.
But these were missing from this year's edition, which suggested that enemy forces could disguise themselves anyway.
""Civilians may have trouble telling the difference between friendly and non-friendly forces, since distance, surroundings, and other factors can create confusion,"" the handbook said.
The handbook told civilians to leave the area as soon as possible if they see any military activity, and not to share footage of Taiwanese military movements online.
While the best way to survive an air raid is typically to seek an underground shelter, Taiwan's handbook said that if time is short, civilians should stay away from walls, doors, and windows to lower the chances of injury from shockwaves of debris.
The guide encouraged those stuck outside to lie flat on the ground, cover their heads, slightly open their mouths, and turn away from the explosion.
The handbook encourages people to talk about their stress or anxiety, while limiting exposure to non-essential news or online information to avoid feeling overwhelmed.
""Maintain a good diet, sleep, and exercise regimen to stay healthy and relieve stress,"" it added.
The handbook specifically suggests that parents prepare go-bags with their children, and encourage kids to talk openly about their anxieties about war.
They should also intentionally teach kids how to distinguish legitimate news from disinformation, the handbook said.
The guide specifically recommends that families start designating three emergency points that all members know how to reach, and have everyone memorize the contact information of three key family members or friends.
They should also familiarize themselves with evacuation routes in their neighborhood, while noting the nearby air raid shelters or aid points.
The guide also contains simple first aid instructions, specifically for what to do when dealing with toxic chemicals, nuclear scenarios, burns, bleeding, and resuscitation needs.
The handbook specifically warns of data collection risks from popular phone apps developed in China, including the AI platform DeepSeek, the social media apps RedNote and TikTok, and the messaging platform WeChat.
""Additionally, some Chinese-brand devices with camera functions, such as surveillance cameras and image sensors, could also lead to privacy leaks,"" the guide said.
The US has raised its own concerns about Chinese-made apps as potential national security threats, most notably when Congress passed a law in 2024 that compels ByteDance, the Beijing-headquartered owner of TikTok, to divest from its app or face a ban from the US.

A top Trump administration economic advisor has a theory on the labor market freeze.
Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Monday that AI may be pushing worker productivity so high that employers are stepping on the brakes on hiring.
""There could be a little bit of, almost, quiet time in the labor market,"" Hassett told show host Joe Kernen, ""Because firms are finding that AI is making their workers so productive that they don't necessarily have to hire the new kids out of college and so on.""
Hasset, however, maintains the position that AI will eventually create more jobs in the long run.
""Because there's so much output growth and income growth, that's the kind of thing that a free market will work out relatively quickly as, you know, new ways to spend money emerge,"" Hassett said.
A study by a team of researchers at Stanford University found that AI is already replacing entry-level coders, causing a nearly 20% decline in employment of 22- to 25-year-old developers by July 2025 in comparison to the hiring peak in late 2022.
The Trump administration has aggressively promoted AI development. Trump has signed several executive orders aimed at easing regulations and expanding AI infrastructure, including initiatives to promote data center growth, such as the $500 billion Stargate Project.
The latest available data from the Bureau of Labour Statistics shows that in August, employers added just 22,000 nonfarm jobs, which fell well below Wall Street's expectation of 80,000. The unemployment rate also ticked up to 4.3% in August, its highest level since October 2021, when the economy was still recovering from the pandemic.
No new jobs data have been released since the government shutdown, but in October alone, Amazon announced plans to eliminate about 14,000 corporate roles, while Target said it would cut 1,000 white-collar jobs to remove what it described as ""overlapping work.""
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Gaming laptops require serious hardware in order to run modern titles at high settings without thermal throttling or performance compromises during extended sessions. The Asus ROG Strix G16 (2025 edition) packs flagship-tier components into a portable package, and it is now $1,699 down from the usual $2,199 price tag.
That’s a record low for Black Friday on Amazon and it feels aggressive; after all, this is a 2025 model that just launched earlier this year. You’re getting an AMD Ryzen 9 9955HX processor paired with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 laptop GPU, 32GB of DDR5-5600 RAM, and a 1TB PCIe Gen 4 SSD.
See at Amazon
The Ryzen 9 9955HX is AMD’s newest high-performance mobile processor, boasting 16 cores and 32 threads on the Zen 5 architecture. The base clock sits at 2.5GHz, while boost speeds go as high as 5.4GHz on single-threaded workloads for serious processing power in gaming, streaming, and content creation. It can also handle background tasks like Discord, multiple browser tabs, and streaming software without negatively impacting the actual performance of your game.
In the RTX 5070, the new Blackwell architecture from Nvidia, the DLSS 4 support, and the Max-Q power optimization all come into play. DLSS 4 generates additional frames using AI processing, effectively doubling or tripling frame rates in supported games without quality loss. Ray tracing performance sees considerable improvements over previous 40-series cards, enabling ray-traced reflections and lighting without framerates penalties that made earlier generations impractical to use. The 8 GB of GDDR6 VRAM can handle 1440p gaming comfortably with high to ultra settings in current AAA titles.
The DDR5-5600 RAM is available in a 32GB capacity across dual channels, providing plenty of bandwidth for memory-intensive games and applications. This speed grade is a major leap from DDR4, which reduces latency in CPU-bound scenarios and improves minimum frame rates when things get really intense during gameplay. The 1TB PCIe Gen 4 SSD hits sequential read speeds of about 7,000 MB/s, which cuts game load times to just seconds instead of minutes.
The 16-inch ROG Nebula display runs at 2560 x 1600 resolution and has a 16:10 aspect ratio for more vertical screen real estate than is provided by standard 16:9 panels. The extra vertical pixels help with productivity work like coding or document editing, while gaming benefits remain minimal. The 240Hz refresh rate with 3ms response time creates incredibly responsive gameplay in competitive shooters and fast-paced action games.
The Tri-Fan cooling system consists of three separate fans, each connected to a full-width heatsink and leading air out through comprehensive venting coverage around the perimeter of the chassis. The aggressive setup here keeps temperatures comfortable even in hours-long gaming marathons with demanding titles. Fan noise stays reasonable at moderate levels of performance, only spiking audibly loud when pushing maximum GPU and CPU loads simultaneously. Liquid metal thermal compound on the CPU improves the efficiency of heat transfer compared to traditional thermal paste, and it drops temperatures by several degrees under load.
WiFi 6E support accesses the newer 6GHz band for reduced interference and lower latency compared to standard WiFi 6. Bluetooth 5.3 handles wireless peripherals with improved range and connection stability. The port selection houses dual USB-C with DisplayPort functionality, three USB-A 3.2 ports, HDMI 2.1 for 4K external displays, an SD card reader, and a 3.5mm audio jack.
Windows 11 Home pre-installs ROG’s Armoury Crate software for performance tuning, fan curves, RGB control, and system monitoring. Battery capacity hits 90Wh, providing roughly 4 to 6 hours during light productivity work and 1 to 2 hours when gaming unplugged. The included 280W power adapter handles the maximum system draw during peak performance scenarios.
You’re getting here current-generation flagship components for 23% below retail pricing on a laptop that only launched months ago. By comparison, competing gaming laptops from MSI and Alienware with similar RTX 5070 specs usually fall between $2,200 and $2,600.

Losing track of your items, especially when youâre on the go, is never fun. AirTags are a great way to always keep an eye on the whereabouts of your essentials. But since most of us have more than one thing worth keeping tabs on, getting just a single AirTag might not cut it. Thankfully, Amazon is making it easier to snap a few without paying the full price.
Right now, the retailer is offering the Apple AirTag 4-Pack for just $65, which is a 34% discount from its original price. That brings it down to around $16 per AirTag, which is practically a steal considering the peace of mind these bring. The deal is open to both Prime and non-Prime members, but we canât say how long it will last. Itâs best to get your orders in before itâs too late.

An AirTag is a coin-like gadget that you can attach to your essentials in multiple ways. You can use an AirTag accessory (like a keychain or loop) to hook it onto your keys or luggage, and even just slide one in your wallet or backpack. Activating these is quite straightforward; just remove the battery tab from the AirTag, bring it closer to your iPhone or iPad, and tap Connect on the prompt that appears. Follow the on-screen instructions to register the AirTag to your Apple ID, and you will be all set!
Once youâre done setting things up, you can use the Find My app to locate your essentials. The Precision Finding features lead you right to your nearby AirTag, and the app even lets you trigger a sound from the built-in speaker to help you find it. For items that are further away, the Find My network can help pinpoint their location anonymously.
Still canât seem to find your valuables? You can also put an AirTag in Lost Mode, which sends you a notification as soon as it detects the AirTag. You can even share the tag with up to five people, or provide its details to a third party (like an airline) to help recover lost luggage.
The replaceable battery lasts up to a year. AirTags are also IP67 water and dust-resistant, meaning these tiny but mighty gadgets can survive not-so-ideal weather conditions well. This deal brings the price down of this 4-pack bundle to just $65, after a nice $34 discount, which makes the purchase much more affordable.

17,2025-11-18,"Mark Zuckerberg has one less problem to worry about.
A federal judge dealt a blow to the Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday, ruling against the agency in a blockbuster antitrust lawsuit against Meta.
US District Judge James Boasberg ruled that the FTC failed to prove Meta formed a monopoly through its purchases of Instagram and WhatsApp.
The ruling means that Meta will not be forced to divest from the two social media apps, as FTC lawyers had requested.
""The Court ultimately concludes that the agency has not carried its burden: Meta holds no monopoly in the relevant market,"" Boasberg wrote. ""Judgment must therefore be entered in its favor.""
The FTC's lawsuit, filed in 2020, alleged Meta's ownership of Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook meant the company illegally dominated the ""personal social networking services"" market — a subset of social media apps that allow users to share content with friends and family. Government lawyers argued the company's $1 billion acquisition of Instagram in 2012 and $19 billion purchase of WhatsApp in 2014 were part of Meta's ""buy or bury"" strategy to maintain market dominance.
Meta maintained that the market was too ill-defined and that the company faces intense competition from apps like TikTok and YouTube.
Boasberg agreed with Meta.
""The Court's two Opinions on motions to dismiss did not even mention the word 'TikTok,'"" Boasberg wrote. ""Today, that app holds center stage as Meta's fiercest rival.""
Boasberg pointed to a 2021 Meta outage, India's TikTok ban, and a half-day TikTok shutdown in the US just before a potential nationwide ban in January as real-world tests showing users moving easily among TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube. That behavior, he wrote, undercut the FTC's core argument that Meta operates in a distinct ""personal social networking"" market.
""Whether or not Meta enjoyed monopoly power in the past, though, the agency must show that it continues to hold such power now,"" he wrote. ""The Court's verdict today determines that the FTC has not done so.""
An FTC spokesman said the agency is ""deeply disappointed"" in the decision and ""reviewing all our options.""
The FTC's case first began at the end of President Donald Trump's first term and forged ahead under former President Joe Biden.
The landmark antitrust trial, held this Spring, saw hours of testimony from Zuckerberg. While on the stand in the Washington, DC federal courtroom, he said Facebook had greatly evolved since he launched the platform more than 20 years ago and that its main purpose wasn't really to connect with friends anymore.
""The Court's decision today recognizes that Meta faces fierce competition,"" a Meta spokesperson said following the ruling. ""Our products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth.""

Nvidia will be the last of the Magnificent Seven companies to report earnings for the third quarter, delivering results after the bell on Wednesday. To say the stakes are high would be an understatement. 
Investors are highly anxious heading into the report as the broader AI trade has come under pressure in the last month. The chip titan's stock is still up 37% year-to-date, but it has fallen by about 5% in the last five days. 
Its decline has led the broader tech sector lower, and investors are increasingly questioning whether the premium valuations commanded by top AI names are justified.
The implications of Nvidia's coming earnings report are significant, not just for Nvidia but for many of its tech peers. Valuations, concerns about returns on AI capex, and the overall demand picture for expensive GPUs are top of mind for investors. Meanwhile,  SoftBank and Thiel Macro, the hedge fund of Peter Thiel, have sold off their entire Nvidia stakes recently, while ""The Big Short"" investor Michal Burry has revealed he's betting against it.
Wall Street analysts, however, seem more bullish than their buyside peers. The mood heading into the report is bullish, and banks expect Nvidia to continue dominating the AI hardware trade in the coming quarters. 
Wall Street estimates that Nvidia will report about $55 billion in revenue and earnings per share of $1.25 for the third quarter. Revenue in its key data center unit is expected to be about $49 billion.
Here's what analysts are saying ahead of the highly anticipated report. 
Bank of America still sees Nvidia as undervalued relative to its dominance of AI hardware. Analyst Vivek Arya reaffirmed a buy rating and updated the bank's forecast to reflect that his team has updated its per-share estimates for the coming fiscal year to $4.56, $7.02, and $9.15 per share.
While Arya notes that Nvidia may flick at a complicated macro outlook in the earnings call, he expects the micro outlook to remain solid. Additionally, his team is optimistic that Nvidia's product pipeline, the Blackwell, Blackwell Ultra, and Vera Rubin chips, will help drive growth in 2026.
""NVDA valuation remains compelling at 27x/21x PE our CY26/27E, essentially a market multiple for the leading franchise in the fastest growth cycle globally trading ~0.6x CY27 PEG on ~40% EPS growth vs. SPX ~2x. Our $275 PO is now based on 30x CY27E vs. 44x CY26E as we extend model forward.""
The bank maintains a bullish price target of $270, implying a gain of about 50%. 
UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri predicts that Nvidia's revenue will come in slightly above Wall Street estimates at $56 billion. His team predicts Nvidia's calendar EPS will reach $7.75 per share in 2026 and could go as high as $9.50 per share in 2027.
Arcuri noted that while some investors have expressed concern regarding Nvidia's gross margins, UBS is confident that the company can keep margins high, forecasting 73.5% for Q3 and 75% for Q4.
""A big focus of the call will clearly be how quickly all of this AI infrastructure can be installed and any customer concentration risks that may develop.""
The analyst urged investors to ""stay the course"" with Nvidia stock, maintaining a price target of $230, 28% higher than current levels. 
In DA Davidson's Nvidia earnings preview, analyst Gill Luria made it clear that his team doesn't think AI demand is set to slow in the coming year. 
He said that despite negative speculation and jitters around valuations, the firm believes Nvidia will maintain its dominance, even if competition rises and trade tensions with China persist.
""We would point towards recent guidance given by management during NVIDIA GTC D.C. that has Blackwell/Rubin generations amounting to $500B of revenue off of 20M GPUs sold with 30% of that already being shipped,"" Luria stated.
Davidson has a $250 price target for Nvidia, valuing the stock at 42 times estimated 2026 earnings and implying a jump of about 39%. 
 CFRA Research also expects Nvidia to beat estimates and point to more progress to come in 2026.
In its earnings preview, CFRA forecasts 18% year-over-year growth and 18% quarterly acceleration, the highest since early 2024. It maintains that Nvidia will need to post revenue of $61 billion and EPS of $1.42 for the January quarter, which its analysts think is achievable. 
""We believe consensus long-term projections remain reasonable, while NVDA's valuation at about 22x CY 27 basis is enticing given growth prospects and management's blue sky TAM vision of $3T-$4T by decade's end,"" stated equity analyst Angelo Zino.
CFRA reiterates its strong buy rating for Nvidia and maintains its bullish $270 price target.
Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, says Wall Street might actually be underestimating Nvidia's strength. He's bullish on the chip company, despite recent downbeat sentiment from investors.  
In his Nvidia earnings preview, Munster noted that he believed some Wall Street analysts are not properly accounting for CEO Jensen Huang's positive projections for its 2026 product lineup, and are not factoring in his most recent comments on soaring demand and a surge in orders for its GPUs. Jensen Huang said at the company's recent GTC conference that Nvidia had booked $500 billion of orders in 2025 and 2026. 
""Jensen gave a Blackwell and Rubin revenue target that suggested there is more than 10% upside through the end of CY26. I expect CY26 revenue forecasts to increase from the current 39% outlook to 45%,"" Munster said.

Winter storms knock out power lines when frozen branches snap under ice weight and leave households in the dark for hours or days. Backup power solutions become essential during cold months when losing electricity means losing heat, refrigeration and the ability to charge communication devices.
EcoFlow’s Delta 2 solves this winter vulnerability with 1,024Wh of battery capacity and 1,800W output, now sitting at $349 instead of the usual $699 price tag (50% off). This is a record low ever for this model with Black Friday timing making it the absolute best moment to grab emergency backup power before the worst winter weather hits.
See at Amazon
The Delta 2 provides 1,800W continuous output with 2,700W surge capacity for starting power-hungry devices such as refrigerators or space heaters. This output level equals small gas generators without fumes, noise, or the need for fuel storage. You can run a full-size refrigerator for roughly 10 to 15 hours depending on compressor cycling, preserving food during extended outages.
15 output ports cover nearly every device type you may need in an emergency or on an outdoor adventure. Six AC outlets handle standard household plugs for lamps, fans, laptops, and small appliances. Four USB-A ports charge phones, tablets, and accessories at standard speeds. Two USB-C ports each supply 100W Power Delivery to fast-charge laptops and modern phones in less than an hour. Two DC5521 barrel ports and one car outlet round out connectivity options for specialized equipment like CPAP machines or portable coolers. Pure sine wave AC output ensures sensitive electronics, like computers and medical equipment, receive clean power identical to wall outlets.
LiFePO4 battery chemistry offers superior longevity compared to the standard lithium-ion cells used in cheaper power stations: Even after 3,000 complete charge cycles, the Delta 2 still maintains 80% of its original capacity which is about 10 years’ use, assuming once a week. Traditional lithium-ion batteries degrade to 80% capacity within 500 to 800 cycles and would need to be replaced much sooner. LiFePO4 cells handle temperature extremes considerably better, operating safely in conditions between 4Â°F and 113Â°F where standard batteries would fail or enter protection mode
Recharging happens through multiple methods depending on your situation and available power sources: wall charging in 50 minutes up to 80% capacity and full charge in 80 minutes via the included AC cable which is important when one is in need of fast backup power between waves of the storm; car charging during a road trip or when your car is the only source of power, though it takes considerably longer at roughly 10 hours for a full charge via a 12V outlet; and solar charging up to 500W of panel input can fill the battery in about 3 to 6 hours of ideal sunlight conditions.
Physical controls on the unit include a bright LCD screen showing all critical information at a glance without needing to access a phone. Individual power buttons for AC, DC, and USB sections let you disable unused ports to conserve battery when only specific outputs are needed. The LED flashlight on the front panel provides emergency lighting with adjustable brightness and an SOS strobe mode for signaling during emergencies. The unit weighs 27 pounds and includes a sturdy handle for carrying between rooms or loading into vehicles; the weight makes extended carrying somewhat tiresome.
At $349, you’re paying roughly $0.34 per watt-hour which dramatically undercuts competing power stations. Most 1,000Wh units with similar output capabilities fall between $600 and $900, making this 50% discount extremely aggressive for Black Friday.

Does this sound familiar? You decide to pull out your phone to capture a special momentâmaybe itâs your kid about to score their first goal at a peewee soccer game. Youâre running alongside them, trying to keep up while holding your phone steady to catch the action. Youâre pumped to watch the footage later, but when you do, youâre hit with the reality… The video is a shaky mess, bouncing all over the place. It’s so wobbly that you can barely even tell what’s happening.
Itâs frustrating, right? But we’ve got great news. It doesnât have to be this way. You donât have to settle for shaky, unwatchable videos. The simple solution is to get yourself a phone stabilizer. The DJI Osmo Mobile 7 is a portable gimbal that will change the way you film. Normally priced at $89, itâs currently available for just $71 with a 20% discount, saving you $18. Thatâs a pretty solid deal if you ask me.

Ever seen one of those clips of someone holding a chicken? It’s oddly mesmerizing, right? The chickenâs head stays perfectly still, no matter how much its body is being moved around by the person holding it. They can contort the chicken every which way, but it’s eyes stay forward and its head in place. Now, think of your phone as the chickenâs head and your phone camera as the chicken’s eyes.
Thatâs what a gimbal like the DJI Osmo Mobile 7 does. It smooths out the shake and wobble you get from just holding your phone, keeping the phone still and aimed where you need it to be. Thanks to a smart control algorithm, the DJI Osmo Mobile 7 can adjust to eliminate shake in real-time. Even if your subject momentarily goes out of view (like if they pass behind a tree or something), the gimbal can keep tracking them, so you donât lose the shot.





When youâre not using the gimbal, you can fold it up into a compact size, making it super easy to stash away. Itâs light tooâjust 300 gramsâso it wonât weigh you down when youâre on the go. Plus, the anti-slip handle means you can comfortably use it for longer periods without your hand cramping up. And if you want to set it down for some hands-free filming, you can turn it into a tripod.
The DJI Osmo Mobile 7 has a solid 10-hour battery life. The gimbal can even be used to charge your phon. Just plug in into the USB-C port.Â  That means you can charge your phone while filming.

When I say there's a lot going on with the Le Wand Lick 3-in-1, I mean it in the best way possible. It’s not just a dual-ended vibrator, offering up G-spot stimulation on one end and clitoral stimulation on the other, but it also features something you don’t see every day: a pussy pump.
It's not the friendliest-looking sex toy. Unlike traditional vibrators that can be easily categorized as wands or rabbits, the suction cup and the flicking tongue make it look like nothing else that came before. But who cares if it looks like a probe from a sci-fi flick—does it do the job?
First up: the vibrating dildo. It’s here you’ll find five extremely powerful vibration intensities packed into the textured shaft, ideal for G-spot or P-spot stimulation. Because this part of the toy also doubles as an ergonomic handle, it has some weight to it and is more girthy than many internal vibrators. That allows the G-spot stimulator to cover more area, making those rumbles feel more intense than they normally would. I typically like stronger vibrations, but I didn’t feel the need to turn things up past the third level on the Lick to find the sweet spot.

Rating: 8/10
When you flip the Lick around, things look more complicated—especially if you’re new to suction play—but if you take your time to understand these features, you’ll be a happy camper. On this end, you have a suction cup and a tongue-shaped clitoral stimulator. Remove the cup—just a quick twist and it’s off—you can easily access the flicking tongue. The tongue has three speeds that, with a bit of water-based lube, are meant to mimic the sensation of oral sex.
It didn’t feel much like oral sex to me, which probably says more about my partners than the Lick, but it felt great against my clitoris. So much so that this was my favorite function of the Lick. However, I want to stress the importance of lube. To truly experience the incredible sensations, you want it to glide seamlessly over your clitoris. Because your clit doesn’t naturally lubricate, the best way to make that happen is with your favorite water-based lube.
Finally, we get to the suction feature. While not as intense as sex toys that market themselves as bona fide pussy pumps, the suction on the Lick is pretty strong. Before I used it on my vulva, I used the pump of my hand to get an idea of what I was up against, and there was some major sucking happening. If you’re unsure why this might be an asset when dealing with pleasure, it comes down to sensitivity.
With the suction cup on your vulva, each time you press the corresponding button, it tightens its grip, essentially demanding that more blood come into the vulva. When this happens, sensitivity in the area is heightened, which, for some, can lead to stronger and longer orgasms. While not a sensation that everyone may be into, it is one that, if you haven’t tried it, is worth giving it a whirl at least once—if only to prove to yourself it’s not (or absolutely is) for you.
As much as the Lick’s features deliver on the pleasure front, the four control buttons are a bit difficult to navigate at first. When you hold the Lick in your hand with the suction cup at the top, the buttons descend in order down the shaft. The on/off button is second-to-last—most sex toys give this button its own spot, or at the top or bottom of the layout of buttons. That way, you won't push it accidentally in the heat of the moment and kill the vibe. Sadly, that exact thing happened to me. The buttons just didn't make sense in my brain.
Battery life is very much dependent on how you use the Lick. It takes about two hours to fully charge, and with that, you can get anywhere from 80 to 180 minutes of run time. I didn’t exhaust the vibrator by trying to get 180 minutes out of it, but that’s a broad spectrum of time that should be taken into consideration.
Ultimately, the Le Wand Lick 3-in-1 does exactly what it promises: gets you off. It’s waterproof, has a unique look, and its trio of options keeps things interesting. I’ve only used the Lick solo, but I can definitely see the pussy pump feature being a fun little addition to partnered play.

As hyperscalers invest hundreds of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure, investors are starting to wonder when they will finally see the technology boost the earnings of small- and mid-cap stocks.
Goldman Sachs says the stock market winners are grouped into distinct phases of AI development. Although hardware makers like Nvidia are the big gainers in the current phase, the bank think investors should be thinking about the next phase. 
""Despite ongoing adoption, returns within the AI complex have remained concentrated in the infrastructure complex rather than the application or productivity layer,"" analysts led by the bank's chief US equity strategist, David Kostin, wrote.  
The bank said investors should watch a handful of stocks as potential future beneficiaries of the coming phase, which will be defined by AI-driven productivity gains. 
""The combination of continued corporate AI adoption and concerns about the risks to the AI infrastructure complex has increased recent investor focus on the next beneficiaries of the ever-expanding AI trade,"" the analysts said. 
About half of the companies that have reported earnings so far this season talked about AI, the bank said, but only a few have been able to point to real gains.
So, which companies are next in line for an AI-driven profits boost? Goldman has some ideas.
The analysts highlighted a handful of firms that are most sensitive to AI disrupting their labor force and have the highest labor costs, and are therefore among the potential beneficiaries of AI-fueled productivity gains.
We list five stocks flagged by the bank, along with their share of wage costs exposed to AI automation, wage costs as a percentage of sales, and the average percentile rank of those two variables among Russell 1000 companies.

24,2025-11-18,"A new market intelligence report suggests that the iPhone 17 lineup is selling incredibly well in China, despite this being a somewhat tricky market for Apple.
It reveals that one in every four smartphones sold in China during October was an iPhone, and that total sales beat the previous record set back in 2021 …
Apple’s relationship with China is a tricky one. Despite moves to diversify production to India, Thailand and elsewhere, the company is still massively dependent on the country as its primary manufacturing hub. That has forced the company to compromise its values in a number of ways, from removing VPN apps from the Chinese App Store to allowing iCloud data to be stored on a server owned by a company associated with the Chinese government.
The Cupertino company’s problems in China don’t end with manufacturing – the government has at times pressured its citizens to buy Chinese brands over iPhones, threatening one of its largest markets. Additionally, iPhone apps don’t have the appeal they do in other countries.
Despite this, however, Counterpoint Research has some very good news for the company. Its latest market intelligence report suggests that while the Chinese smartphone market as a whole grew 8% year-on-year in October, iPhone sales grew 37%.
Apple accounted for one in every four smartphones sold in China during October, growing 37% YoY, driven by the iPhone 17 series. All three iPhone 17 variants saw mid-to-high double-digit growth rates in October compared to the iPhone 16 series, with the base model continuing to grow fastest […]
It is the best ever start to a December quarter for Apple, with total sell-through far surpassing its previous peak in October 2021. One in four smartphones sold in China during October was an iPhone – a milestone hit only once before, in 2022, when Apple had fewer rivals in the premium segment.
This 25% market share saw Apple dominate smartphone sales last month, with the second and third placed brands accounting for just 16% (Mi) and 17% (Vivo) each. The company appears to have been particularly successful in persuading Huawei buyers to switch, the Chinese company seeing its own sales fall 19% year on year.
Counterpoint said that all three iPhone 17 models saw double-digit growth, though the base model was the best-selling one.
The report doesn’t reveal anything about sales of the iPhone Air.

25,2025-11-18,"Apple had a bumper month for iPhone sales in China in October, with sales jumping 37% compared to a year earlier on strong demand for iPhone 17 models, according to data from research firm Counterpoint.
One in every four smartphones sold in the country for the month was an iPhone – a market share milestone Apple hasn't achieved since 2022, when there were fewer rivals in the premium segment. The iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max reached mid-to-high double-digit percentage growth, led by the standard iPhone 17.
New iPhone models accounted for more than 80% of Apple's unit sales, Counterpoint senior analyst Ivan Lam said. It is the best ever start to a December quarter for Apple, far surpassing its previous peak in October 2021.
""There is always some risk, especially with the much-expected Huawei Mate 80 series launching on November 25,"" said Lam. ""But there's a lot of momentum behind Apple at this point. There is not much tapering to indicate a steep drop off.""
China's overall smartphone sell-through grew 8% year-over-year in October, thanks to the performance of Apple's iPhone 17 series as well as that of domestic manufacturers like Xiaomi, which climbed to the number 2 spot for the first time in over a decade.
The data paints a rosy picture for Apple in the Chinese market, despite reports of a lukewarm reception for the iPhone Air, which has also performed poorly in other markets.

PS5Sale 
The cost of gaming is too damn high. Seriously, these machines just keep going up in price and every year it feels like weâre getting closer to $90-$100 games. Keeping an eye on sales is essential these days, and thankfully, if youâre in the market for a PS5, you can save a full Benjamin on the cost of a new one thanks to Sony’s Black Friday 2025 deal.

Black Friday, the most sacrosanct of consumerist holidays, will see Sony offer a suite of PS5 bundles, as well as a flat $100 discount on PS5 Digital Edition, the disc-based version, and the PS5 Pro. Sony has outlined the specifics of the deals over on its official PlayStation blog. Console savings include:
But thatâs not all. Sony is also taking $100 off of the PS VR2 (which you can also use on a PC with the right adapter, I might add). You can also pick up a new DualSense controller for $20 off, or for $30 off of the more premium (and very good) DualSense Edge gamepad.
Speaking for myself, my current controller is starting to show signs of drift, so Iâm likely eyeing a new controller anyway. That or Iâm gonna get creative with a soldering iron (which might end up being a wildly more expensive indulgence).

Great news for monopolists: If you successfully swat away regulators for long enough, a new approach might come along and disrupt your monopoly status after nearly a decade of unfettered domination of your domain, thus rendering you not a monopoly despite enjoying all the benefits of one.
On Tuesday, Judge James Boasberg ruled that Meta did not create an illegal monopoly for social media platforms by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp, in part because competitors like TikTok have cropped up in the intervening period.
The case, which is five years in the making and comes 13 years after Facebook bought Instagram and 11 years since it bought WhatsApp, failed because, according to the judge, the Federal Trade Commission failed to prove that Meta currently holds a monopoly over the social media advertising market. âWhether or not Meta enjoyed monopoly power in the past, though, the agency must show that it continues to hold such power now,â Boasberg said in the filing. âThe Courtâs verdict today determines that the FTC has not done so.”
That’s mighty convenient for Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who pretty explicitly expressed a desire to dominate the space when they bought up its competitors. The FTC showed messages from the exec where he stated, “It is better to buy than compete,” and specifically said that “One way of looking at this is that what weâre really buying is time,” with the intention of integrating a competitor’s features “before anyone can get close to their scale again.” Those certainly sound like the words of someone who would like to control an entire sector, but because they weren’t able to hold onto it, it apparently doesn’t matter.
âWhile each of Metaâs empirical showings can be quibbled with, they all tell a consistent story: people treat TikTok and YouTube as substitutes for Facebook and Instagram, and the amount of competitive overlap is economically important,â Boasberg wrote in his decision. âAgainst that unmistakable pattern, the FTC offers no empirical evidence of substitution whatsoever.â
The judge also fairly identified that social media has changed since Meta’s multi-billion-dollar acquisition spree, shifting primarily to video, where apps like TikTok and YouTube do, in fact, dominate. To that end, he noted that âconsumers are reallocating massive amounts of time from Metaâs appsâ to its competitors, which ultimately âforced Meta to invest gobs of cash to keep up.â Not exactly a rousing endorsement of the quality of Meta’s products, but hey, they’ll probably take the harsh assessment in exchange for not having to sell off parts.
Meta is the latest of the Big Tech giants that have managed to avoid a truly punishing antitrust crackdown due to the rapidly changing landscape. Google, which was found to have a monopoly over online search, also managed to dodge the harshest of penalties because of the emergence of generative AI, which the judge overseeing that case posited could disrupt Google’s search dominance.

28,2025-11-18,"When the Nintendo Switch 2 launched this summer, a cheaper, Japanese-only version of the console was made available domestically. Some speculated the more affordable console (which cost around $340 compared to the multi-language Switch 2âs $480) was offered to address a weak yen or the cost of living in Japan, but whatever the reason, it helped: the Switch 2 was Japanâs biggest ever console launch, according to VGC.Â 
In June, the other Japanese gaming behemoth, Sony, said it was keeping an eye on the Switch 2 in terms of competition, but wasnât all that concerned because of the PlayStation 5âs âdifferentiated strategy,â as reported by Polygon. Sony Interactive Entertainment president and CEO Hideaki Nishini said that the PlayStation 5 was âthe best place of play.âÂ 
“We believe PS5âs level of performance is required to achieve a great experience on big screens. And in this way, we have provided a unique offering to players and creators in this current console generation,â Nishino said.Â 
But over the last few weeks, Sony has displayed a renewed interest in its Japanese market, holding a Japan-centric State of Play on November 11 that focused on games developed in the region, and also announced a cheaper PS5 that, similar to the Switch 2, is only for use in Japan. Itâs the first region-locked console Sony has released since the PlayStation 2, and a new report suggests this maneuver may be because Sony is finally considering Nintendo a proper competitor.Â 
According to a report from Push Square (based on a translation from Install Base user Hartmann, which lines up with machine translation of the segment), Japanese media outlet TV Tokyo discussed the price drop with local experts, who suggested that Sony wasnât bothered by PlayStationâs shrinking market in Japan until hearing of Nintendoâs cheaper Switch 2. According to the TV Tokyo segment, Sony executives decided to ape Nintendoâs approach, and allegedly approved the PS5 price cut in just four months.
 The reporters also suggest that Sony president Nishino, who stepped into the role this past April after taking over for Dutch-born Hermen Hulst, felt so strongly about PlayStationâs flagging brand in Japan (Nishino is Japanese) that he helped push the region-specific console to market.Â 
The Japanese-only digital version of the PS5 goes on sale on November 21.Â

Last week, President Trump caused a media frenzy after he floated the idea that the government should back the creation of a 50-year fixed mortgage.
Many commenters, including some of Trump's own supporters, hated the idea. They complained that it would result in Americans being in debt for their entire adult lives, essentially renting from a bank. They complained that this type of mortgage would explode the amount of interest homeowners would have to pay over the lifetime of their loans. They complained that borrowers would be stuck paying interest-only payments for many years and be prevented from actually paying down their principal and building equity in their homes.
""It will ultimately reward the banks, mortgage lenders, and home builders while people pay far more in interest over time and die before they ever pay off their home,"" posted Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green (R-Ga.). ""In debt forever, in debt for life!""
President Trump ""is creating generational debt,"" said Josh Johnson on The Daily Show. ""They're going to be fighting to get out of grandma's will. Grandkids will be like, 'I barely knew her!'"" (Side note: Josh Johnson is very funny. I'm a fan.)
The uproar over the 50-year mortgage idea reached such a high pitch that apparently the White House was furious with the administration official who pitched President Trump the idea, according to reporting from Politico.
Sure, it won't solve our housing affordability problem. But is a 50-year mortgage really such a crazy idea?
""It's not quite as outlandish as it sounds,"" says John Campbell, an economist at Harvard University.
""Honestly, I kind of think it's a fine idea,"" says Eric Zwick, an economist at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business. ""It's not obviously so different from a 30-year fixed mortgage.""
First of all, the reality is most homeowners ditch their mortgage well before its end date. Some refinance. Others move.
In America, unlike some other countries, including the UK, you can't take your mortgage with you if you sell your house. So when people sell their house and move, they end their mortgages.
The typical American homeowner spends less than 12 years in their home, according to a Redfin analysis of the U.S. Census data. That's actually high compared to recent history. Back in the early 2000s, Americans typically spent only about seven years in their houses.
"" Most people will not have that 50-year mortgage product for that length of time,"" says Daryl Fairweather, the chief economist of Redfin. ""I think in a world where this product exists, a lot of people might sign up for it initially and then try to refinance later.""
In other words, the 50-year mortgage would not be a 50-year trap. It would basically serve as another option on the menu for homebuyers looking to finance their homes. And, because you have longer to pay off the loan, it comes with the benefit of having somewhat lower monthly payments. Maybe that could help some secure their dream house or reap the benefits of investing in the housing market. 
""I think affordability is a concern in the housing market,"" Zwick says. ""And one element is the down payment, but another element is the monthly payment. And a longer duration mortgage is gonna lower the monthly payment.""
And, sure, there are real drawbacks to this sort of financing, including especially a much higher interest bill over the life of the loan and an extended period where homeowners aren't paying down their principal and building equity. But those same issues also arise with the 30-year fixed mortgage, albeit to a lesser degree.
And Americans apparently love the 30-year mortgage. More than 90% of American mortgage holders have one!
The fact that so many American homeowners have long-term, fixed rate mortgages, and they're able to basically refinance pretty easily whenever they want, makes the U.S. mortgage market pretty weird compared to most other countries.
We won't get into the complicated history here (we might actually do a Planet Money episode on this history in the future). But, for now, we'll say the 30-year mortgages date back to the Depression era. And they're fundamentally a creature of government intervention. The government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buy mortgages from private lenders, allowing them to offload (and socialize) the risks associated with lending large sums of money for decades at fixed interest rates.
Without this intervention, the 30-year mortgage would probably not be so ubiquitous. I mean, think about it. Would you want to lend someone hundreds of thousands of dollars for decades and freeze the amount they will pay you for providing them with that money? What if they lose their jobs or die? What if interest rates skyrocket and you can find much more favorable terms for lending out that money? And then, to boot, if interest rates fall, the borrower can just walk away from that loan and get a new mortgage at any time when economic conditions are more favorable to them? I mean, yikes. No thanks.
A long time ago, Planet Money interviewed financial journalist Bethany McLean about 30-year fixed mortgages, and she described them as ""a financial Frankenstein's monster"" from the perspective of lenders.
Without an important role for the government in backing these loans, ""I don't think any rational bank would offer this product,"" says David Berger, an economist at Duke University.
"" You need the public sector to play an important role for really long duration mortgages to be viable in the financial system,"" says Joseph Gyourko, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business.
It helps explain why this sort of mortgage system is so rare in the world.
There are some clear benefits of the weird mortgage system we have in the United States. One is lower monthly payments because homebuyers can pay off their loans over 30 years. Another is homebuyers are given an incredible ability to freeze their housing costs in stone and then refinance when it suits them.
Several of the economists we spoke to had 30-year mortgages themselves, and they had refinanced when rates sank below 3 percent a few years ago. They were very nice people, but I hate them now. (I bought a house more recently and the mortgage rate is close to 7 percent).
Anyways, the ability to freeze rates and then refinance later if the opportunity arises is clearly a huge benefit to homebuyers. It offers predictability on your housing costs. And, especially nice, a fixed-rate mortgage basically shields you from inflation and its accompanying higher interest rates. Everything else may get more expensive, but your housing payment actually falls in real terms when there's inflation!
That said, as we already alluded to, both 30-year and hypothetical 50-year mortgages come with costs: they tend to have higher interest rates than adjustable rate mortgages and you have a longer period upfront paying interest and not actually paying down your loan much.
But there's more.
If the housing market gets dicey and prices start plummeting, having a large outstanding loan at a fixed interest rate can create serious problems. Gyourko, the economist at Wharton, says long-term, fixed-rate mortgages increase the probability that you can go underwater on your home, a situation where you owe more on your house than it's worth.
"" The borrower on a really long duration loan — 30 or 50 — does not build equity very quickly at all,"" Gyourko says. "" There's a risk that if there's a severe drop in house prices, you go underwater.""
Going underwater is a nightmare. If you sell, it means the money you get won't cover your debt. It gets much harder to refinance, meaning you're stuck with a higher interest rate than you could otherwise get in a situation where the housing market tanks.
If you have a fixed-interest rate and the housing market tanks, ""your house price goes down and you're kind of stuck,"" says Berger, the economist at Duke. ""No one is gonna lend to you when you're underwater. If you had an adjustable rate, your rate would've just dropped automatically,"" and maybe that would help you make your housing payments and not lose your house.
""And are you more likely or less likely to be laid off if house prices drop a lot? Answer: more likely,"" Gyourko says. ""So you run that risk of those two events coinciding, and then you've lost a huge amount of your personal wealth.""
Depending on the state of the economy, the direction of interest rates, and your financial circumstances, it might not make sense to fix your interest rate. Actually, that may be the case right now. Interest rates spiked in 2022 and 2023 and have already started to come down, and many expect them to go down further, especially if the economy enters a recession.
"" Right now, I think it does make more sense for people to get an adjustable rate mortgage,"" Fairweather, the chief economist at Redfin, says.
Adjustable-rate mortgages typically start with lower interest rates than fixed rate mortgages. Fairweather says you can think about the choice to buy a long-term, fixed-rate mortgage instead of an adjustable rate mortgage as effectively paying extra for insurance against future interest rate hikes. And, just like the standard advice for buying any other kind of insurance, ""you don't really want to get insurance if you can afford to self-insure,"" she says. In other words, if you think you could afford the possibility that interest rates spike in the near future, it probably makes sense to get an adjustable rate mortgage.
"" So if you get the adjustable rate mortgage, what I would advise is to make sure you have some room in your budget left over for when the mortgage rate resets potentially at a higher level so that you're not hit with costs that you aren't able to pay,"" Fairweather says. ""But if you could take that savings and you know, put it in your savings account, then you'll probably end up a-okay with an adjustable rate mortgage and actually save money compared to the fixed rate.""
But there are other, economy-wide issues with having so many mortgage-holders with long-term fixed rates.
One is that the government involvement in the housing market that makes our system of widespread 30-year mortgages possible can occasionally result in big problems for taxpayers, especially if regulators aren't vigilant in preventing shady loan practices. Just see what happened during the global financial crisis back in the late 2000s.
""The worst possible situation is what happened in the global financial crisis when Fannie and Freddie were basically insolvent, were put on the treasury's balance sheet and to this day remain there,"" Gyourko says.
Another problem with America's weird system of ubiquitous fixed-rate mortgages is that it may weaken the Fed's ability to juice the economy or lower inflation when needed (aka conduct monetary policy).
That's because fixed-rate mortgage holders are shielded from interest rate changes. If everyone had an adjustable rate mortgage, the Fed could maybe more easily juice the economy by lowering people's monthly payments, nudging them to spend more in the economy. That said, if interest rates go low enough, it will induce many American homeowners to refinance, lower their payments, and potentially goad them to increase their spending and boost the economy.
In inflationary times though, when the Fed needs to bring down spending in the economy, the Fed's job may be tougher and more distortionary to the economy. If everyone were on adjustable rates, the Fed could just raise rates and, boom, homeowners would probably start spending less and inflation would come down. But most American homeowners are shielded from rate increases, so it's new homebuyers — often younger people — who feel more of the pain. Some argue that's unfair.
Speaking of unfairness, Harvard's John Campbell points out that maximizing your personal wealth in our weird mortgage system relies on considerable financial literacy, and populations that are poorer and less educated tend to be less financially literate. So this system results in greater inequality.
""A lot of people don't know when to refinance and they just don't do it,"" Campbell says. ""And there's some very troubling evidence that, in this country, black and Hispanic borrowers are much slower to refinance than white borrowers."" The result, he says, is they tend to pay higher interest rates.
There's another problem with our system: lock in. This has been talked about in recent years. There are tons of homeowners out there who now have rock-bottom interest rates on their mortgages — like, ahem, many of the very financially literate economists I spoke to — and they're reluctant to move.
Lock-in may be one reason why American home prices have been stubbornly high over the past few years, even as interest rates have spiked. Other countries, where adjustable rate mortgages are more the norm, have seen their housing prices dip a lot more in recent years.
"" I think that their housing markets are more reactive to their overall economies,"" Fairweather says. ""So in other places where there's more adjustable rate mortgages, when interest rates go up, that means that homeowners have a reason to sell because their payments are going up. And if they can't afford them or they don't want to pay them, then they'll put their homes on the market.  In our housing market, that doesn't happen. There is this unequal treatment between first time home buyers and existing homeowners. And it really benefits long-term homeowners.""
Even more, economists believe that the lock-in that fixed mortgages create is bad for the economy. Many people may be refusing jobs where they could be more productive because they don't want to move.
So, yeah, many of the problems identified with the 50-year mortgage idea are also present with the 30-year mortgage.
The real motivation for this idea is to enable more Americans to buy houses. With high prices and higher interest rates than a few years ago, many Americans are priced out.
The economists we spoke to all stressed that this new financial product will not solve the fundamental problem of housing affordability. To do that, we need to start building a lot more homes. Some even said that by juicing demand with this new financial product and not increasing supply, this proposal could actually make housing prices go higher, contributing to the problem.
""Proposals to help home buyers — whether it's this 50-year mortgage or whether it's Kamala Harris's proposal in her presidential campaign to give money to first time homebuyers — the main beneficiaries are actually the people selling houses,"" Campbell says. ""Because given the supply, if you make it easier for buyers, they're bidding against each other for the same supply. The price is gonna go up. The winner is gonna be the person selling.""
So, yeah, we need to build more homes. But, in that world, maybe a 50-year mortgage would have some benefits for some people. Of course, they will need to know the facts about this financial product and make sure it's the right product for them.
Berger, the economist at Duke, recommends that the government invest more in helping Americans become more financially literate about mortgages and provide better information about alternative financial options to the 30-year mortgage. This stuff is complicated!

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sundas Khalid, a Google employee in her 30s who lives in Seattle. The following has been edited for length and clarity.
Growing up, my family didn't have a lot of money, and I wasn't very financially literate.
I was always into saving, but investing was like a foreign world to me.
In 2013, I broke into tech with an internship at Amazon, which led to a full-time data engineering role, and I started earning good money, $77,000 in my first full-time year. In 2019, I joined Google, where I'm now a principal analytics lead.
After years of growing my salary, last year I earned $292,000 working in Big Tech — and $302,000 from my side hustle in content creation, where I share advice about breaking into tech.
Over the years, I've learned more about navigating finances and investing. Here are the tips I use to grow and manage my wealth.
When recruiters used to ask me for my salary expectations, I'd tell them my total compensation at the time, but I began to realize it didn't work in my favour. If I wasn't earning my market value, a company could offer me a lower salary based on the number I shared.
Now, I'll either tell the recruiter I don't want to share my salary expectations or that I want to do the interview before telling them. Then, I'll turn the question back on them by asking what the average salary range is for the role. If that range aligns with my expectations, I'll move forward with the next stage of the interview.
If I get a job offer, I use online tools, such as levels.fyi, to understand what people at my level of seniority in my location earn at that company, to help me negotiate my salary.
When asking for a higher salary than what a company has offered, you should communicate what value you'll bring to the business and team. I prefer doing this in writing over email, because I'm good at written communication, but often, negotiations happen over the phone. In those instances, I'll often do a dry run with a mentor, who'll give me feedback about how to phrase things. Having a script or bullet points ready ahead of time can also help with nerves.
It's also worth keeping in mind that these tips work better when the job market is good, as you may have less negotiating power in a bad market.
I used to keep all my money in my bank account instead of investing it. I wasn't proactive about investing in my 401(k) earlier in my career either.
I read two books to boost my financial literacy: ""The Simple Path to Wealth"" by JL Collins, which talks about index funds, and ""I Will Teach You to Be Rich"" by Ramit Sethi, which taught me about credit and banking.
Spending $20 on a good book can be the best investment in your financial future, providing a comprehensive, end-to-end guide that you can supplement with online resources. For example, I watched countless YouTube videos and read blogs about Roth IRAs, a type of retirement account, to get my head around them.
Instead of putting all my money in savings, I've now set up an automated payment of $2,500 from my monthly salary into a Vanguard personal stock portfolio. I try to keep six months' worth of living costs in my savings account, and if I accumulate extra, I'll also invest this into index funds, so I'm not keeping more money in savings than necessary.
As your income grows, make sure your lifestyle costs don't creep up, so you have more disposable income to invest. I avoid buying designer clothes to live frugally.
I started posting career content on Instagram in 2016, and it has grown into a side business where I share educational videos about breaking into tech on platforms including YouTube, and earn money from brand partnerships. Last year, I earned $302,000 in revenue.
My intention for sharing career tips wasn't to make money, and the importance of having a side income didn't hit me until tech companies started laying people off around 2023. Having multiple income streams is now essential. If I were to lose my job, I have a plan to fall back on, which gives me a lot of mental peace.
If you're starting a side hustle alongside a full-time job, ideally choose something you're passionate about and that makes you money at the same time. If you're not excited about it, you'll likely give up after a month or two.
Money can be a taboo topic. When I was at Amazon, I never talked about it with coworkers.
The more I learned about investing and money, the more comfortable I became talking about it. It's now more normal for me to talk with colleagues about how much we earn.
This has been really helpful for my content creation business. In the past, when negotiating brand partnership contracts, I've sometimes reached out to another creator I know who's worked with that brand to ask how much they got paid. The creators in my network are very transparent with each other.
For anyone who thinks they're late to investing or financial literacy, you can catch up, just like I did.

Sometimes, we buy the story of inconvenient creation. The carrots at the farmer’s market or a hand-crafted piece of pottery is worth more because we know the focus and care that went into the creation of an item.

The breakneck pace of investment in companies developing AI tech over the past few years has many onlookers convinced we’re currently in an AI bubble. Sundar Pichai knows the situation is serious: when the AI bubble bursts, “no company is going to be immune,” the Google CEO told the BBC.

In an interview with the BBC at Google’s headquarters in California, Pichai drew parallels between today’s AI market and the 1990s dot-com boom, during which investment in internet startups reached a fever pitch before a crash saw tech firms lose trillions in market cap and shed tens of thousands of jobs. Back then, “There was clearly a lot of excess investment,” Pichai said, “but none of us would question whether the internet was profound.” Pichai said AI investment is in a similar spot today.
Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority?
“I expect AI to be the same,” Pichai told the BBC, gesturing to the technology’s potential to remain relevant after this initial boom subsides. “So I think it’s both rational and there are elements of irrationality through a moment like this.” BBC notes that Google parent Alphabet’s stock price has doubled this year amid the AI boom; the company currently has a market capitalization of about $3.5 trillion.
The AI market has seen frenzied investment activity in recent months. In October, Bloomberg reported on a complex network of deals involving OpenAI and other AI firms that analysts are concerned may be “artificially propping up the trillion-dollar AI boom.” Google continues to invest heavily in AI infrastructure: This week, the company announced a $40 billion investment to build out data centers in Texas.

37,2025-11-18,"Long the scourge of water companies for blocking pipes, a ban on the sale of wet wipes made of plastic has been signed into law.
The new rules will come into force in 2027 and will bring England into line with legislation across the rest of the UK. 
Plastic wipes don't disintegrate when flushed down the toilet, so when oil and fat congeal on them, so-called fatbergs form in sewers, which water companies say cost them £200m a year to clear.
Most of the wipes that are sold in the UK are now made of non-plastic materials but the government and water companies say they should not be labelled as ""flushable"" because they can still cause blockages.
The wet wipe manufacturers contacted by the BBC said their non-plastic ""flushable"" wipes have been thoroughly tested and comply with all the rules. 
Fatbergs can become huge if the blockage is not cleared. 
Just last month a massive stinking lump of wet wipes, fat and oil was removed from a west London sewer. It weighed the same as eight double-decker buses and took a specialist team more than a month to break down.
The market for wet wipes has been growing steadily for years. According to government figures in 2023, 32 billion wipes were sold to UK consumers of which about 12 billion contained plastic. If they were all laid out flat that's enough to cover 2,200 football pitches with plastic wipes. 
Though they welcomed the new legislation for England, water industry sources were also quick to point out its limitations. 
UK companies will still be able to manufacture and export plastic wet wipes, and they will still be available for people to buy from pharmacies both in person (behind the counter) and online. Businesses like hotels will be allowed to buy the wipes, without restrictions.
The medical profession successfully argued for an exemption from the wet wipe ban, arguing that non-plastic wipes absorb too much of the detergents and disinfectants impregnated in them, with potential consequences for patient safety. 
At Minworth Wastewater Treatment works in the Midlands the scale of the current problem can be both seen and smelt.
Minworth serves a population of more than two million people across Birmingham and the Black Country and Severn Trent, who run the facility, say 10 tonnes a day of wet wipes end up here.
""It's a nightmare,"" Grant Mitchell, Severn Trent's head of blockages says, as we survey a small mountain of wipes.
He's just shown us the area where the ""un-flushables"" are filtered out from the sewage. It's grotty stuff. There are dead rats, a rubber duck as well as a huge ball of soiled wipes.
""Wet wipes are a problem because they're made to not break down like toilet paper,"" he says. ""So they stay in one piece, and they gather together with fat, oil, and grease from kitchens, congeal and create a fatberg which causes flooding.""
Also on hand at Minworth is Emma Hardy the Minister for Water and Flooding.
""It's going to make a huge difference,"" Emma Hardy, the Minister for Water and Flooding, said of the ban as we sheltered from the rain at Minworth. ""I think people maybe underestimate the amount of problems that these wet wipes cause.""

While many brands say their wipes are ""flushable"" and environmentally friendly, whether they can and should be disposed of down the toilet is being questioned.
Daniel Jolly is researching how fast these biodegradable wet wipes break down. In a lab at the University of East Anglia in Norwich we watch as he simulates what a toilet flush does to a wipe.
""This isn't toilet paper"" he says as the wipe slowly breaks apart into fibres while he stirs the water inside an tank. ""Even though it's the same basic materials, this is built completely differently and it's much stronger.""
Jolly has been carrying out tests on the banks of the River Yare to see how quickly the plastic-free wipes disintegrate.
""It's a period of most likely months to a year, or two years, depending on the environmental conditions that they're in,"" he says. 
""That's much slower than toilet paper which is between weeks to several months, but much better than a plastic wipe which can last hundreds, even thousands of years in certain situations.""
Research commissioned by the government found that some non-plastic wipes failed tests on how fast they disintegrated, meaning they could still block sewers. 
Jolly is now looking at what impact the biodegradable wipes have on aquatic life as they fall apart. 
Until March 2024 the water companies ran a certification scheme which gave the green light for some wipes to be put in the toilet, called ""Fine to Flush"".  But that was discontinued because of fears it was causing confusion among consumers and replaced with a new slogan ""Bin the Wipe"".
Now the advice from the government and the water companies is very clear. Only the three P's - pee, paper and poo should be put down the toilet. 
""Restricting the sale of wet wipes containing plastic is a step in the right direction,"" said a spokesperson for Water UK, the industry's trade body. ""But we really need a ban on their manufacture and mandatory 'do not flush' labelling on all wet wipes.""
Some of the manufacturers who market ""flushable"" wipes told the BBC that they were in fact moist toilet tissues, but Water UK said it still viewed them as wet wipes so they shouldn't be flushed. 
""I would encourage them [the wet wipe manufacturers] to show leadership on this right now,"" says Minister Hardy. 
""Instead of marketing them as being flushable, provide labelling to inform the public that they need to bin them and not flush them down the toilets.""

Today, in the Calculated Risk Real Estate Newsletter: California October Home Sales ""Highest Level Since February""; 4th Look at Local Markets
A brief excerpt: From the California Association of Realtors® (C.A.R.): California home sales hit highest level since February, C.A.R. reports California home sales rose in October from both the prior month and a year ago to reach the highest level since February, the CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS® (C.A.R.) said today.

Closed escrow sales of existing, single-family detached homes in California totaled a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 282,590 in October, according to information collected by C.A.R. from more than 90 local REALTOR® associations and MLSs statewide. The statewide annualized sales figure represents what would be the total number of homes sold during 2025 if sales maintained the October pace throughout the year. It is adjusted to account for seasonal factors that typically influence home sales.


October home sales edged up 1.9 percent from 277,410 in September to 282,590 in October. Home sales improved 4.1 percent from a revised 271,370 recorded a year earlier. There is much more in the article.

In the long-standing court battle between the FTC and Meta's alleged social media monopoly, a federal judge today (Nov 18) ruled in favor of the latter.
It was reported by Politico that federal judge James Boasberg ruled that Meta was not in violation of holding a social monopoly after acquiring WhatsApp and Instagram. Boasberg states, ""The Court ultimately concludes that the agency has not carried its burden: Meta holds no monopoly in the relevant market."" There is one interesting aspect to note about this federal ruling, and that concerns TikTok. Instagram's head, Adam Mosseri, previously stated that the platform was in ""fierce competition"" with TikTok to ""attract users under 30.""
Even Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, argued that Facebook serves a ""different role in the social media space,"" as do Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta's COO, Sheryl Sandberg, stated that the company did not acquire the latter in order to ""neutralize"" or control that particular market space, but rather to ""improve and grow"" them.
With this in mind, and with the inclusion of Meta seeking to better compete with TikTok in the social media space, it's been reported that Judge James Boasberg rejected the FTC's claim that TikTok falls within the entertainment category, not social media. The post claims Boasberg made this decision based on evidence that Instagram and WhatsApp ""benefited"" from TikTok's brief blackout in the U.S. earlier in 2025.
Boasberg adds, ""Like Heraclitus’s river, the rapids of social media rush along so fast that the Court has never even stepped into the same case twice. ... Each time it examined Meta’s apps, they had changed. The competitors had, too.""
 



TikTok was in some hot water with the U.S. Government earlier this year, dodging a full ban for the second time in April. The Beijing-based company was publicly against divesting any portion of TikTok to the U.S., with it stating it would rather hop out of the country entirely, rather than see any part given away. However, TikTok and the U.S. government have been in talks since April about a potential divestiture agreement, which would have to see approval from the Chinese government, too.
At the time, ByteDance (TikTok's parent company) stated, ""an agreement has not been executed"" and that ""there are key matters to be resolved."" The Trump Administration has said that it ""does not want TikTok to go dark.""

It was during this time in April, and earlier this year in January, when TikTok actually disappeared for a while, that Judge James Boasberg cited in his ruling. Moreover, Boasberg mentioned a similar scenario in India from 2020, when it banned TikTok. The judge stated that users viewed the apps as involved as ""similar apps,"" thus facilitating its rejection of the FTC's claims in favor of Meta.

The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) reported the housing market index (HMI) was at 38, up from 37 last month.  Any number below 50 indicates that more builders view sales conditions as poor than good.

From the NAHB: Builder Sentiment Relatively Flat in November as Market Headwinds Persist
Market uncertainty exacerbated by the government shutdown along with economic uncertainty stemming from tariffs and rising construction costs kept builder confidence firmly in negative territory in November.

Builder confidence in the market for newly built single-family homes rose one point to 38 in November, according to the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) released today.

“While lower mortgage rates are a positive development for affordability conditions, many buyers remain hesitant because of the recent record-long government shutdown and concerns over job security and inflation,” said NAHB Chairman Buddy Hughes, a home builder and developer from Lexington, N.C. “More builders are using incentives to get deals closed, including lowering prices, but many potential buyers still remain on the fence.”

“We continue to see demand-side weakness as a softening labor market and stretched consumer finances are contributing to a difficult sales environment,” said NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz. “After a decline for single-family housing starts in 2025, NAHB is forecasting a slight gain in 2026 as builders continue to report future sales conditions in marginally positive territory.”

In a further sign of ongoing challenges for the housing market, the latest HMI survey also revealed that 41% of builders reported cutting prices in November, a record high in the post-Covid period and the first time this measure has passed 40%. Meanwhile, the average price reduction was 6% in November, the same rate as the previous month. The use of sales incentives was 65% in November, tying the share in September and October.  
...
The HMI index gauging current sales conditions increased two points to 41, the index measuring future sales fell three points to 51 and the gauge charting traffic of prospective buyers posted a one-point gain to 26.

Looking at the three-month moving averages for regional HMI scores, the Northeast rose two points to 48, the Midwest fell one point to 41, the South increased three points to 34 and the West gained two points to 30.

The index has been below 50 for nineteen consecutive months.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Andrew Wang, a 33-year-old senior software engineer based in San Francisco. After working at Amazon, he joined Fermat Commerce Inc., an e-commerce AI startup. His identification and employment have been verified by Business Insider. This story has been edited for length and clarity.
When I started my career, you could go to a three to six-month boot camp and get a job.
That's kind of what I did.
After high school, I attended a boot camp and then started a web-design firm with a friend. Then I studied computer science at Harvard and founded a startup with an MBA friend while I was there.
I was very green at the time, and wanted to see what the industry was like. So I got a job in the field and eventually worked at Amazon for three years. Now I'm back at a Series B startup.
At the beginning of my career, I received a lot of mentorship, and I felt like I was invested in. That helped me become technically better, but also helped me become a better and more empathetic mentor myself. That's something I really appreciated about engineering culture and I don't want to see that go away.
I don't work with any entry-level engineers currently, but I read forums, and I see a lot of junior engineers posting about sending hundreds, sometimes even thousands, of applications, and hearing nothing back. A lot of junior engineers have also reached out to me, and from what I've heard, the market is really hard. I think it's very real that juniors are struggling to find jobs.
While AI may be a part of the problem, I think there are multiple factors at play.
A few years ago, software engineering was sold as an easy pathway to a high-paying, secure job — and I think that led to some over-saturation in the field.
The job market tends to swing like a pendulum. So maybe we're overcorrecting now. Hypothetically, 10 years down the line, when there aren't enough senior engineers because we didn't hire enough of them now, engineers may become highly in-demand again.
But I do think AI is also part of the problem.
There's this trendy sentiment among leadership to boost productivity, and then use AI to ""replace"" engineers. Some companies have a very reductionist view of junior engineers, where they're expected to come in and execute a project, and then their job is over. Those firms may prefer to have one engineer managing five AI agents. Right now, because of macroeconomic factors, companies may be incentivized to cut costs by using AI instead of hiring more engineers.
But I think there's a tug-of-war going on. There's another camp that thinks engineers can offer a lot. Those people view AI as a tool that boosts productivity, allowing teams to produce more.
I think each company handles it differently, but those that had planned to outsource talent will likely use AI to augment it. Companies that wanted to find ways to cut costs were going to do it anyway.
Mentorship is really important to me, so during my interview process, I asked companies whether they had a culture of mentorship and how teams were split between experience levels. Anecdotally, I saw that a lot of smaller companies are leaning heavily senior right now, which I think is understandable.
It's a big investment to hire, train, and mentor entry-level employees.
As a previous founder, I can understand that when you're in a rush to build, you don't have the time or the resources to dedicate toward building an entry-level pipeline. You and your investors are focused on getting the product out.
But in general, I think it's important to view entry-level engineers as an investment.
When I was at Amazon, I worked with a lot of junior engineers. They added a ton of value to the company, and a lot of them were extremely capable. Experience level doesn't always dictate how incredible an engineer you are, and missing out on entry-level hiring is a detriment to the field long-term.
When your senior engineers are retiring, and there's suddenly a huge lack of replacements because you didn't hire enough junior engineers 20 years ago or 10 years ago — What do you do then?
My advice is: If you really want to be in tech, you should pursue it.
Tough job markets come and go. I have a lot of respect for people who take help desk jobs or IT roles in hopes of eventually breaking into the field. That adaptability is key.

San Francisco will get to try another robotaxi service — although this one's a little different.
Starting Tuesday, Amazon's Zoox is allowing some members of the public to try its toaster-shaped driverless cars as part of its early rider program.
'""We have seen incredible interest in Zoox in this market and are excited about this first step to bring our purpose-built robotaxi experience to more people,"" Zoox CEO Aicha Evans said in a statement.
Users on the Zoox app will be removed from the waitlist to get access to free rides. The company says this will allow Zoox to get feedback on the service.
A Zoox spokesperson told Business Insider that users are taken off the waitlist based on criteria such as location. The company states that its current service area in San Francisco includes the South of Market, Mission, and Design District neighborhoods.
The spokesperson could not say how many people will be accepted for the initial launch of the early rider program.
Zoox currently has about 50 robotaxis across Las Vegas and San Francisco.
The spokesperson said Zoox will accept more riders as it expands its robotaxi fleet.
The company launched a free-ride service earlier in September on the Vegas strip.
""Since launching our service in Las Vegas in September, we've had thousands of people from around the world experience their first rides in the robotaxi, and the response has been overwhelmingly positive,"" the spokesperson told Business Insider. ""Riders are enjoying the group experience and have consistently called out their preference to ride in the Zoox robotaxi over a traditional car.""
By now, San Franciscans have become familiarized with self-driving cars thanks to the ubiquity of Waymo's robotaxis. Waymo has more than 1,000 cars operating in the Bay Area as of November.
Waymo's current robotaxi fleet is made up of Jaguar I-PACE SUVs retrofitted with sensors.
Zoox's robotaxis are distinct in that they're manufactured by the company specifically for the purpose of providing autonomous rides.
The car, which features a distinct, bubbly, rectangular shape, lacks a steering wheel and pedals. Riders also face each other inside the vehicle, similar to an enclosed gondola at ski resorts.
Zoox has been testing its self-driving vehicles in San Francisco since 2017.
Over the past eight years, the world of robotaxis has undergone significant shifts.
GM shuttered its Cruise robotaxi program. Waymo is offering fully autonomous rides in five major US cities. Tesla began a pilot run of Robotaxi in Austin and the Bay Area, with safety monitors inside the car.
Uber also has plans to launch a robotaxi fleet next year in partnership with Lucid Motors and Nuro.

45,2025-11-18,"The Micro:bit is a fun microcontroller development platform, designed specifically for educational use. Out of the box, it’s got a pretty basic sound output feature that can play a single note at a time. However, if you’re willing to get a bit tricky, you can do some pseudo-polyphonic stuff as [microbit-noob] explains.
The trick to polyphony in a monophonic world? Rapidly alternating between the different notes you want to be playing at the same time. Do this fast enough and it feels like they’re playing together rather than seperately. [microbit-noob] demonstrates how to implement this with a simple function coded for the Micro:bit. Otherwise, it uses the completely stock sound hardware. However, the IR receiver is added to the device in order to allow a simple remote control to be used to command the notes desired, along with some extra tactile buttons to add further control.
Is it chiptune? Well, it’s a chip, playing a tune, so yes. Even if it is through a tiny speaker stuck to the PCB. In any case, if you’re trying to get some better bleeps and bloops out of the Micro:bit, this is a great place to start.

The term you were looking for is an arpeggio.
That term is even used in the article.
Another equally-viable term would be TDM: TIme-Division Multiplexing. Depends, really, on how fast the microcontroller is cycling between each note.
Some microcontrollers, like the SunPlus SPG2xx series, have an audio output rate which is a multiple of the number of audio channels, and the hardware emits the current sample for each channel in a round-robin fashion. You need a low-pass filter to file off some of the higher harmonics that this technique introduces, but it works surprisingly well, producing near SNES-quality audio (and, for that matter, video) on a SoC with only 3 kilobytes of RAM. There’s a good reason why the SPG series has been used in all manner of individual TV-pluggable games, and a variety of other cheap handhelds, to boot.

Good to see that the ""professionals"" are looking up from their greedy profits and starting to realize that the Jenga tower is tottering.
They went from buying low to selling high and are now shorting the stocks.

Did taxes pay for 2008 and 2020 Fed bailouts?
These ""experts"" are going to do, upon seeing all the warning lights that are starting to light up, what every goddamned moron that has a car, and doesn't understand cars will do when faced with a lit Christmas tree, some of it blinking:
Derrrrrr... look, a blinking red light on the dash.. should I stop? Eh, it's probably nothing important.

  -- some time later --
*BANG* Motherfucker, I just lost the engine... why?  WHY DO YOU DO THIS TO ME?!
Because the Experts are as stupid as the average ""motorist.""  They will ignore the signs and run the bitch ragged, then sell it and move on.
Now.. if this time the investors *listen* and dont' fall for the AI hype, maybe the trouble will be averted.  But, there is rare evidence of there being prior acts of common sense, so.. I expect this too will be a huge bubble that pops and takes down many with it.
I, for one, am too old to welcome our new AI overlords and their attendant economic crash, now with added social upheaval.  This one will likely take me down.  The others (2008, etc etc) have nearly always indirectly or directly wiped me out, and i'm getting tired of it.
One can start from near zero only so many times.
From the Same BoA Global Fund Manager Survey
""Average cash level dropped to 3.7% of holdings.   Cash levels of 3.7% or lower has occurred 20 times since 2002 and on very occasion stocks fell and Treasuries out-performed for the following 1-3 months""   Past performance, not a guarantee, etc etc
My takeaway is that it seems like everyone is saying the same thing.   AI bubble.   The CEO's of the firms involved, press, government, retail investors,  now global fund investors.  Yet investment managers still have to be deeply invested in this bubble to compete with the returns of the other managers...to get your fat Xmas bonus, etc.
Two cars racing to a finish live, but with a cliff soon after the line.  Neither is slowing, indeed peddle to the metal, assuming the other guy will chicken out first and  that they will be able to hit the brakes just in the nick of time to avoid going over the cliff.
Pretty sure both are going over
So when one of them goes off the cliff do they take all the spectators with them? Or does the Fed act as a value buyer and put a safety net under the cliff edge?
According to Reagan should your taxes be much higher right now to pay off the debt he ran up? Why aren't they? Is your story totally unrelated to how insurance and forgiveness and can-kicking work in the actual world?
Bursting of the AI bubble can't come soon enough. Far too much tech bro nonsense, DRAM / GPU prices way too damn high while unhealthy levels of collateral damage accumulate.

The circular AI deals continue. The latest example stars Anthropic, Nvidia, and Microsoft.
On Tuesday, Anthropic announced it plans to spend $30 billion on compute to scale its Claude AI model on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, ""powered by Nvidia."" Nvidia is also committing to invest up to $10 billion in Anthropic, as part of the deal, and Microsoft will invest up to $5 billion.
""We're excited to bring our models as a choice to Microsoft Azure, and Anthropic will be the first model that is available on, you know, all three of the biggest clouds,"" Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said in a video announcing the deal.
Microsoft, an early investor in OpenAI, recently completed its financial restructuring with the frontier model maker. Microsoft also has a partnership with Elon Musk's xAI, which allows it to host Grok4 on its Azure AI Foundry.
As part of the deal, Anthropic is also committed to contracting additional compute capacity up to one gigawatt. According to a joint announcement, the compute will be made up of Nvidia's Grace Blackwell and Vera Rubin systems.
The announcement comes as concerns about an AI bubble persist on Wall Street amid ballooning valuations and spending commitments. Nvidia is set to report its earnings on Wednesday, which will be closely watched as a barometer for the market's outlook on AI. The world's first $4 trillion market cap company, shares of Nvidia have slid roughly 7% in the last five days.

Premium brands like Sonos and Bose created the TV soundbar market because modern TVs keep getting thinner and leave no room for decent speakers that produce quality sound. Amazon spotted this trend and developed its own Fire TV soundbar that has become a runaway hit, stealing market share from established competitors. For early Black Friday, Amazon has dropped the price to $84 from the usual $119 which marks a record low that makes this soundbar’s value proposition unbeatable.
See at Amazon
A dual-speaker setup brings in full and rich audio that clarifies TV dialogue and delivers it more clearly than any thin TV speaker could do. Voices of film and television actors stand out distinctly instead of getting muddled by the background music or sound effects. The improved bass response helps add depth to explosive effects, music, and other low-frequency sounds that a flat-screen TV speaker can barely reproduce.
DTS Virtual X technology crafts a three-dimensional soundstage, and virtually envelops users in surround sound from just the two front-facing speakers. Audio seems to emanate from all different directions around the room, rather than coming from a single point below your TV. This spatial processing creates a far more immersive way of enjoying movies, as sounds of every type-source are positioned where they would naturally occur in a scene. Dolby Audio processing enhances the overall sound with added detail and clarity and reveals subtle audio elements in music and films that basic television speakers will often mask or eliminate completely.
The system sets up in literally seconds, thanks to the single HDMI cable connection. You hook up the included HDMI cable to your television’s HDMI eArc or ARC jack, and it just works: the soundbar comes to life with audio already synchronized to video. There is no complicated configuration, no multiple cables to manage, and no digging around through TV menus to enable audio output.
The compact 24-inch length and 2.5-inch height fit under most TVs without blocking the screen or IR sensors. The slender profile easily slides onto TV stands and entertainment centers without needing furniture rearrangement or special mounting hardware. The soundbar will remain unobtrusive while dramatically improving your audio experience, keeping a clean look that doesn’t dominate your living room setup.
Bluetooth connectivity makes the soundbar a wireless speaker for streaming music from your phone or tablet. You can fill the room with Spotify, Apple Music, or podcasts without ever having to turn on your TV. The audio quality works for casual listening and background music during gatherings or when working around the house. The Bluetooth range is good enough to cover typical room sizes without dropouts, issues in connectivity and pairing is fast via common standard Bluetooth settings on your devices.
Fire TV integration means easy operation with Fire TV devices or Fire TV Edition televisions. Your same old Fire TV remote now controls both the volume of the TV and the soundbar without any programming or setup. You adjust audio levels using the same remote you use for just about everything else, never having to juggle multiple remotes or reach for the soundbar itself. It recognizes commands instantly without lag, and changing volume feels utterly natural and immediate.
But the soundbar works with any smart TV or streaming device, not just Fire TV products. In fact, your Roku, Apple TV, Chromecast, or cable box can all get enhanced audio through the HDMI connection. Gaming consoles such as PlayStation and Xbox route their audio through the soundbar for better gaming sound with clearer directional cues and more impactful effects.
For $84, you’re getting a fraction of what Sonos or Bose would charge for similar features while getting audio processing technology that matches-if not surpasses-what the premium brands offer.

50,2025-11-18,Nvidia's $500 billion AI chip backlog signals strong 2025--2026 growth as analysts anticipate higher data center sales
51,2025-11-18,"As more and more Android phones start natively supporting Qi2, is the OnePlus 15 one of them?

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Best answer: No, the OnePlus 15 does not support Qi2 magnetic charging due to the lack of built-in magnets. In fact, you can't enable Qi2 even by using a case. Only standard Qi wireless charging is supported.
Battery life was clearly one of the top priorities when designing the OnePlus 15, and it shows. The massive 7,300mAh capacity commands a lot of space in the phone and since OnePlus didn't want it to feel like a brick in your pocket, it decided to ditch Qi2 charging. Rudolf Xu, senior product marketing manager at OnePlus, told Android Central that adding magnets in the phone would have made it too heavy and that they needed the space for the battery.
What's really surprising, though, is that the OnePlus 15 isn't even ""Qi2 ready,"" which means you can't enable Qi2 charging even with a case. The Samsung Galaxy S25 series doesn't have built-in magnetic charging either, but it is Qi2-ready, which means you can do 15W wireless magnetic charging using the right case.
 



Is this going to be a huge deal-breaker for most buyers? Probably not. The OnePlus 15 can charge at 50W wirelessly, which beats even the Qi2 25W standard, but you'll have to buy OnePlus' special wireless charger separately to enable this. There's also a ridiculously fast 120W wired charging speed (80W in the U.S.), and that charging brick comes in the box. Fast magnetic charging would have been nice to have, which would have made the OnePlus 15 work well with many existing MagSafe accessories in the market.
While the OnePlus 15 scores big points on power and battery life, some other aspects have taken a back seat in order to keep the pricing nearly the same as the 13. The display has a slightly lower resolution than before, and the camera performance doesn't break any new ground. If gaming and durability sit higher up on your wishlist over cameras and display resolution, I think you would be more than satisfied with what the OnePlus 15 offers.
 




Battery champion
The OnePlus 15 packs one of the biggest batteries we've ever seen in a flagship phone, with a 7,300mAh capacity that dwarfs the competition. This translates to an impressive multi-day battery life, which beats most other Android flagships.

53,2025-11-18,"Apple is expected to launch its first foldable iPhone next year, and while there have been plenty of rumors about the book-style foldable's design and cameras, there are still questions surrounding its potential battery life, particularly given Apple's recent focus on thinness.
According to the leaker and news aggregator account ""yeux1122"" on the Korean-langauge Naver blog, Apple is testing a battery in the 5,400–5,800 mAh range, which would make it the largest capacity of any current or previous iPhone. For reference, the iPhone 17 Pro Max has a 5,088 mAh battery.
As for how it would compare to rival foldables already on the market, the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold has a battery size of 5,015 mAh, while the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 has a 4,400 mAh battery, so anything in Apple's alleged testing range would likely offer superior battery life.
A March report from the same Korean aggregator account claimed that Apple has placed a heavy focus on improving power efficiency while slimming down key components of its foldable iPhone, with battery life said to be a key priority for the company. Separately, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has said the device will use high-density battery cells.
The latest post claims that Apple will eventually settle on a capacity at the higher end of its testing range, as it apparently did previously with the iPhone Air. The details allegedly originate from a supply chain source, and the blog has offered accurate insights into Apple's component strategy in the past, but it has also been wrong, so a degree of caution is warranted.
Multiple sources agree on key specifications for Apple's first foldable iPhone, including a 7.8-inch main display when unfolded and a 5.5-inch cover display. That's the consensus among Kuo and fellow analyst Jeff Pu, as well as the Weibo leaker Digital Chat Station. The device is also expected to use Touch ID integrated into the side button instead of Face ID, similar to the iPad Air and iPad mini.
Apple's first foldable iPhone is expected to be equipped with four cameras, consisting of one front camera, one inner (possibly under-screen) camera, and two rear cameras. The device will reportedly use Apple's second-generation C2 modem for cellular connectivity, but it will lack a physical SIM card slot.
Barring any unexpected delays, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman believes the foldable iPhone will launch alongside the iPhone 18 Pro models in the fall of 2026.

    Gemini 3 is available to all users in the Gemini app, along with powering AI Mode in Google Search.
  
Google Gemini 3
Gemini 3, the latest AI model from Google, is the company's most intelligent model to date, with more advanced multimodal and vibe coding capabilities, the company said in a blog post on Tuesday. It's available now.
Google says Gemini 3 is ""built to grasp depth and nuance"" and is better at understanding the intent behind a user's request. The company also touted Gemini 3's multimodal capabilities, such as its ability to turn a long video lecture into interactive flash cards or to analyze a person's pickleball match and find areas for improvement.
Gemini 3 isn't limited to the app. It'll also be available in AI Mode in Search and, for Pro and Ultra subscribers, in AI Overviews. In AI Overviews, Gemini 3 can generate interactive elements. 
Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.
Google DeepMind's Demis Hassabis and Koray Kavukcuoglu said in a blog post that Gemini 3 Pro is less sycophantic, a problem that's been plaguing AIs and leading to AI psychosis in some. It's also more secure against prompt injection attacks, in which bad actors try to make an AI ignore its original instructions and perform unintended actions. 
The company also unveiled Google Antigravity, a new agentic development platform. Google says Antigravity is like having an active partner while making tools or working on projects, autonomously planning and executing complex software tasks while validating its own code. It works in tandem with Gemini 2.5's Computer Use model for browser control and works with nano banana, Gemini 2.5's image model. 
Gemini 3's new, more powerful, agentic capabilities will only be available to $250/month Google AI Ultra subscribers at first. This will allow the Gemini Agent to do multi-step workflows, like planning a travel itinerary.

Google's release of Gemini 3 comes as an AI war is heating up between it, OpenAI, Anthropic and xAI. Google's consistently been leading AI leaderboards, although other AI models haven't been far behind, sometimes trading spots at the top. With the release of Gemini 3, Google seems to be trying to solve for some of AI's more annoying problems, like hallucinations or sycophancy. It's also trying to prove that AIs can be truly agentic, being able to accomplish tasks on the user's behalf. Other agentic models have proven to be problematic in real-world usage and run into various security concerns, especially in web browsers. 
The latest AI release from Google also comes at a time when there are fears of an AI bubble forming in the stock market. AI companies, including Nvidia, Google, Meta and Microsoft, account for 30% of the S&P 500. Google currently has a valuation of $3.4 trillion. Even Google CEO Sundar Pichai says the trillion-dollar AI investment boom has ""elements of irrationality"" and that a burst would affect every AI company, he said in an interview with the BBC. Still, if Google is to keep its stock price moving upward, it needs to demonstrate that its AI models beat the competition. 
AI exists in Google Search currently in two ways: via AI Overviews and through AI Mode. AI Overviews is the window that appears under your search query, where a smaller AI model attempts to quickly answer your questions. AI Overviews is a separate tab in Search, alongside Images, Shopping, News and Videos that runs a more advanced model allowing users to converse with it. It's like using Gemini, but without having to go to the main Gemini website. 
As of now, Gemini 3 is in AI Mode, but only for those who pay for a Google AI Pro or Ultra subscription. Gemini 3 enhancements are also available in AI Overviews, but only for subscribers. Gemini 3 Pro is available in AI Mode for subscribers as well. In AI Mode, Google is touting Gemini's ability to take existing information and create bespoke UI elements. This magazine-style view will incorporate interactable widgets, images and videos. For example, if researching mortgages, Gemini can create a custom calculator to help you compare terms and savings options. 
Google Search uses a ""fan-out"" technique to pull information from across the web. With Gemini 3's advanced reasoning, Google says Search can uncover more information on the web and intelligently understand your intent. "
56,2025-11-18,"The selloff marked the fourth consecutive day of market losses.
Stocks closed markedly lower on Tuesday as fears of a bubble in artificial intelligence technology hammered markets for a fourth consecutive trading day.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 498 points, or 1%, while the S&P 500 fell 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled 1.2%.
The selloff, which has touched some of the world's largest companies, marks a rare bout of turbulence on this year’s glide path to higher returns.
In recent days, many investors have raised alarms about tech companies dependent on AI. As big-tech names spend hundreds of billions to build data centers necessary to run the energy-intensive technology, the financial benefits remain uncertain.
""Tech companies have to spend to keep up with surging demand, but that demand largely hasn’t turned into profits or productivity,"" Callie Cox, chief market strategist at Ritholtz Wealth Management, told clients in a memo on Tuesday. ""Investors get skeptical about the payoff.""
Still, Cox added: ""AI will likely pay off in economic benefits down the road, but those who are overexposed to tech in their portfolios have to ride out this phase of selling.""
The Nasdaq plummeted 3% last week, the index’s largest weekly decline since the aftermath of President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs in April. The S&P 500 ended three consecutive weeks of gains.
Market gains this year have been concentrated in a handful of tech giants, known as the magnificent seven: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Tesla and Nvidia. Worries over artificial intelligence have thrown cold water on the stocks in recent days, causing their prices to waver.
Shares of Nvidia have dropped nearly 9% since late October, including a slight decline on Tuesday. Meta has declined 17% over the past month.
Even after recent losses, the S&P 500 remains up 13% in 2025. While the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 8%, and the Nasdaq has soared 17%.

A cordless workstation is a clean workstation, and it can also be an efficient one with the right gadget at hand. If your everyday work involves dealing with multiple devices at once, a solid docking station can be an excellent investment.
The best options out there that feature multiple ports and reliable power delivery usually donât come cheap, but Amazon is currently making it easier than ever to grab one. Right now, the Anker 14-in-1 USB-C laptop docking station is going for just $43 on the retailer, after a sweet 39% off its retail price. The deal, however, is selling out fast, which means the offer (or the stock) wonât be around for much longer. We highly recommend acting fast to grab yours before itâs too late!
See at Amazon
Youâre getting 14 connectivity options in a compact, lightweight build. These include two 4K HDMI ports, a 1080p VGA port, a 5 Gbps USB-C port, a 100W USB-C PD-IN port, five USB-A ports, a 1 Gbps Ethernet port, an SD / micro SD slot, and an AUX port. The two 4K HDMI and one 1080p VGA port let you connect up to three external screens at the same time. Windows users will enjoy extended display support, while on macOS, the displays will only mirror whatâs going on your main display. Regardless, these are great for adding multiple screens for a bigger, more productive setup. With Windows, you can be hosting Zoom calls on one and present using the other. Or work on one while having reference documents open on the rest; the possibilities are endless!
The USB-A and USB-C ports support ultra-fast file transfers at impressive 5 Gbps speeds. This hub also offers up to 80W of pass-through charging, which means all your laptops will stay charged as you power through your productive days.
Compatibility-wise, the hub plays nicely with USB-C, USB4, and Thunderbolt 3/4 laptops, and supports Windows 10/11, macOS (12 and up), and ChromeOS systems. And since it’s quite lightweight, you can carry it around with you easily. Just toss it in your laptop bag, and youâre good to go!
Anker also throws in an 18-month warranty with your purchase for some extra peace of mind. All things considered, itâs a great option to consider if youâre looking to manage a bunch of different devices in a compact, clean way. The current discount puts the hub in a much more affordable range.

Most of us wait for year-end sales to grab big-ticket items, and itâs finally that time of the year. Black Friday is still a week away, but you donât have to wait till then to start saving. Early deals are coming in hot already!
Those who have been looking to upgrade their gaming setup for less can now grab the 27-inch LG UltraGear OLED gaming monitor for just $500 on Amazon, after a massive 44% drop in its retail price of $900. Itâs definitely not your average markdown, as most other options with somewhat similar spec sheets sit well over $1,000. But as youâd expect, itâs a limited-time discount. The retailer hasnât mentioned when the deal ends, but based on past trends, itâs safe to say it wonât be around for long. Hurry to grab yours before the price goes back up, or the stock expires for good.
See at Amazon
The size is fairly decent. Itâs not too big to take over your entire desk space, nor too small to make everything feel cramped; just the right size. The 27-inch screen supports VESA DisplayHDR True Black 400, which offers brilliant color accuracy, especially in scenes with low light. The 1.5 million:1 contrast ratio paired with 98.5% DCI-P3 color coverage makes sure all your favorite content appears lifelike, just how the creator intended. Youâll get brighter highlights in daylight scenes and excellent clarity in the dark, which is great for spotting the bad guys hidden in the shadows.
The screen also has an anti-glare, low-reflection coating that makes it easier on the eyes. You wonât have to fight reflections in brighter settings or squint to see whatâs on screen during the day.
Performance-wise, youâre getting a 240Hz refresh rate and an ultra-responsive 0.03ms GtG response time for ultra-fast, smooth gameplay. Itâs officially G-SYNC Compatible and supports AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, meaning youâll enjoy exceptional performance regardless of the GPU at hand.
You also have the option to make height, tilt, and pivot adjustments as you like. Sitting back or playing while standing â the monitor stays at just the right angle. For connectivity, there are both HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 1.4 options, plus you even get a 2-year warranty on the OLED panel with your purchase for some extra peace of mind. Get your orders in before it shoots back up!

Whatâs better than grabbing a reliable, powerful everyday machine that even comes with Windows 11 Pro installed, for under a grand? Probably not much.
If you have been looking for such a machine from a known brand, now is the time to make the move. Amazon has currently dropped the price of the 15-inch Dell Inspiron touchscreen laptop to $960, which is a straightforward, no-fuss 70% discount on its retail price of over $3,000. This is also the lowest price we have seen this laptop go for in a month, but the offer doesnât end here.
The retailer is also throwing in a bunch of useful computing accessories with your purchase for absolutely nothing. The 5-in-1 kit is worth almost $200, but grabbing the laptop gets you that for free. Of course, deals this good donât stick around for long, which is why we highly recommend getting your orders in fast. Once itâs gone, thereâs no telling if itâll return for Black Friday or if itâll still be in stock by then.
See at Amazon
This machine looks quite basic, but it packs serious performance for both work and play. The overall design is quite minimal, and features a modest 15.6-inch touchscreen that pushes stunning visuals for all your tasks. The anti-glare coating makes it easy on the eyes in both bright and dim settings, so whether youâre working in daylight or tackling tasks late at night, you wonât be straining to see the screen.
Touch support makes it easier to navigate. You can simply use your fingers to scroll through long documents, swipe around, pinch, and even type assigments; great for when you donât want to bother with the trackpad or the mouse.
For performance, youâve got a 10-core 13th Gen Intel Core i7-1355U processor that clocks up to 5.0GHz, paired with a hefty 32GB of RAM. Together, these make it easy to perform all your tasks with ease, without even a hint of lag. Store all your important files with the spacious 1TB SSD, which also offers faster boot and load times than traditional drives.
Connectivity options include WiFi, Bluetooth, plus a wide range of ports to connect essential devices. The accessory kit gets you a patented mouse, a USB Hub, a 128GB USB flash drive, a 7-in-1 cleaning kit, and pre-installed Windows 11 Pro. Thatâs all you need to get started right away!

Look around a middle school, high school, or even college campus, and you'll probably notice Gen Alpha and Gen Z girls in oversized pastel hoodies with a palm tree logo. This is the Pink Palm Puff hoodie — an $89 sweatshirt that has become a status symbol for young girls.
For the ""Well Spent"" podcast, we talked to Lily Balaisis, the 17-year-old founder of clothing brand Pink Palm Puff. (You can read our full profile of Balaisis and her company here.) Balaisis tells us about how she was inspired to launch the company at such a young age, how she gets it done while still in school, and why she thinks young people love hoodies so much.
""Teens these days, if you ask them what makes a hoodie special, they have a phrase, 'what makes a hoodie a hoodie,'"" Balaisis said. And while she thinks the fabric softness is key, there's another element: ""For Pink Palm Puff, the unboxing moment is another huge thing for the brand. I've seen people collect the boxes.""
Also in this episode, Casey Lewis of the youth trend report newsletter After School joins us to talk about why expensive hoodies have become a status symbol for kids — and why Pink Palm Puff hit a sweet spot.
""Well Spent"" is a new video podcast from Business Insider with me (Katie Notopoulos, hi!) all about consumerism — how we buy things, why we buy, and what bigger forces in tech, business, and culture shape those things. Our first episode was all about real estate and the housing market — slightly more expensive than a hoodie, but you get the idea.

One of Tesla's most fearsome Chinese rivals has just cracked the code to profiting from EVs.
Smartphone maker Xiaomi said on Tuesday that its electric vehicle business had turned a quarterly profit for the first time, less than two years after launching its first car.
The Apple rival's EV, AI, and other new initiatives division reported a gross profit of $98.5 million for the quarter ending in September.
Revenues in the division hit a record high of $4 billion, with 28.3 billion yuan ($3.98 billion) coming from EV sales and 0.7 billion yuan ($98.5 million) from ""related businesses.""
Hitting profitability caps a meteoric rise for Xiaomi's EV venture.
Like Western rival Apple, the Chinese tech giant invested billions in building an electric car to rival Tesla and BYD — but unlike Apple, Xiaomi actually managed to ship an EV, launching the sleek SU7 sedan in March 2024.
The SU7 was a smash hit, selling over 130,000 units last year, and Xiaomi's second vehicle, a Tesla Model Y competitor called the YU7, amassed 240,000 preorders in 24 hours when it launched in June 2025.
Xiaomi has faced headwinds, with the company's stock price falling after a fatal crash involving an SU7 earlier this year, but sales have continued to grow. Xiaomi said on Tuesday it had delivered over 100,000 EVs in the third quarter, up from around 40,000 over the same period last year.
Making money from selling EVs is notoriously difficult. By reaching profitability in under two years, Xiaomi has joined the small list of companies that have avoided the so-called ""Valley of Death"" that has claimed many promising EV startups.
Elon Musk's Tesla reported its first profitable quarter in 2013, around 10 years after the company's foundation and five years after Tesla began deliveries of its first vehicle, the Roadster.
It took Tesla another seven years to report a full year of profitability, during which the company nearly went bankrupt as it scaled up production of new models. Tesla reported $1.62 billion in operating income in the most recent quarter.
BYD, China's largest seller of EVs, has also been consistently profitable. The Chinese automaker reported $1.1 billion in net income in the third quarter and saw its revenues eclipse Tesla's for the first time last year.
However, BYD benefits from selling both hybrids and pure battery-electric vehicles, unlike Tesla and Xiaomi.
Other automakers have struggled to make money from building electric vehicles. Detroit giants Ford and GM continue to lose billions on their EV businesses, while startups Lucid and Rivian both reported losses of around $1 billion in the third quarter.
Even in China, where electric vehicle adoption is far ahead of the US, brutal price wars and cutthroat competition mean that only a few companies have managed to turn a profit.
Xiaomi rival Nio reported a net loss of nearly $700 million in the second quarter of 2025, while fellow EV startup Xpeng is closing in on profitability after cutting its own loss to just $50 million in the third quarter.
Leapmotor, a Chinese EV startup that has partnered with Jeep owner Stellantis, reported its second straight quarterly profit on Monday.

69,2025-11-18,"The Black Friday deals are really starting to heat up at Best Buy. 

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

To be honest, when I wrote about Black Friday Meta Quest deals yesterday, I had no idea that Best Buy was about to make every other retailer look bad with an incredible offer of its own. Live and learn, right? 
As of this morning, if you buy the Meta Quest 3S 128GB during the holiday sale Best Buy will give you $50 off the price along with a free copy of The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners, three months of Meta Horizon Plus, AND a free $50 gift card to spend on anything you'd like. All things said and done, you're looking at $144 of total savings. Considering that the Meta Quest 3S was already the most approachable headset on the market, this deal presents an incredible opportunity for anyone who's ready to dip their toes into VR gaming. Why wait for Black Friday? 
Meta Quest 3S 128GB: $299 $249, plus $50 gift card, free game, and more at Best Buy
Meta Quest Elite Strap with Battery: $129.99 $103.99 at Best Buy
Of course, I'm still eagerly waiting for a Black Friday discount on the standard Meta Quest 3, but this deal is the next best thing. The affordable Meta Quest 3S boasts the same graphical processing power as its more-expensive big sibling, plus you get slightly better battery life, an improved facial interface for added comfort, and some upgraded low light tracking capabilities. Both VR headsets also share the same Snapdragon chipset and 8GB of RAM, and you'll have access to the same library of games. 
The regular Meta Quest 3 is still better than the Quest 3S in a few areas, namely resolution and FOV. The standard model also comes with a 3.5mm headphone jack (which the Quest 3S lacks), and the Quest 3's pancake lenses generally offer a more next-gen experience than the 3S' Fresnel lens design. 
You could compare the Quest 3S vs the Quest 3 until you're blue in the face, but in my opinion, it all comes down to price. If you're new to VR gaming or shopping for someone else this holiday season, I'd argue that the Quest 3S offers much more bang for the buck. Add on $144 of savings and purchasing the affordable headset becomes a no-brainer.

        Goldman Sachs tackled the “most important question for the U.S. equity market outlook” on Monday: whether the market is “correctly valuing the benefits from AI.” The answer is a qualified yes, a denial that company valuations are at “bubble levels,” and a finding that the market is,…

71,2025-11-18,"Aid agencies have reiterated calls for Israel to allow more tents and urgently needed supplies into Gaza after the first heavy winter rainfall, saying more than a quarter of a million families need emergency help with shelters.
""We are going to lose lives this winter. Children, families will perish,"" says Jan Egeland, Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC).
""It's actually so frustrating that we've now lost so many crucial weeks since the adoption of the Trump peace plan, which said humanitarian aid would flow and the Palestinians would not needlessly continue to suffer.""
With a majority of the population displaced by two-years of a devastating war, most Gazans now live in tents - many of them makeshift.  
They have been clearing up after widespread flooding due to a winter storm that began on Friday. 
There are fears that diseases could spread as rainwater has mixed with sewage water.
""My children are already sick and look at what happened to our tent,"" said Fatima Hamdona, crying in the rain over the weekend, as she showed a BBC freelance journalist the ankle-deep puddle inside her temporary home in Gaza City.
""We don't have food - the flour got all wet.  We're people who've been destroyed.  Where do we go? There's no shelter for us to go to now.""
The story was the same in the southern city of Khan Younis.
""Our clothes, mattresses and blankets were flooded,"" said Nihad Shabat, as she tried to dry out her possessions there on Monday.  
Her family has been sleeping inside a shelter made of sheets and blankets.  
""We're worried about getting flooded again. We cannot afford to buy a tent.""
A recent UN report found that across Gaza more than 80% of buildings had been destroyed and 92% in Gaza City.
According to the NRC - which has long led the so-called Shelter Cluster in Gaza, made up of some 20 non-governmental organisations (NGOs) - about 260,000 Palestinian families, or about 1.5 million people, are in need of emergency shelter assistance, lacking the basics to get through winter.
The NGOs say they have been able to get only about 19,000 tents into Gaza since the US-brokered Israel-Hamas ceasefire took effect on 10 October.  
They say they have 4,000 pallets of aid - containing non-food items, including tents and bedding - blocked from entering.  Supplies that have been bought are currently stuck in Egypt, Jordan and Israel.
Jan Egeland blames what he calls ""a bureaucratic, military, politicised quagmire"" running ""counter to all humanitarian principles"" for the hold-up. 
In March, Israel introduced a new registration process for aid groups working in Gaza, citing security reasons.  It requires that they give lists of their local Palestinian staff.  
However, aid groups say that data protection laws in donor countries prevent them from handing over such information.
Many items, including tent poles, are also classed as ""dual-use"" by Israel, meaning they have a military as well as civilian purpose, and their entry is banned or heavily restricted.
Cogat, the Israeli defence body that controls the border crossings, told the BBC that ""over the last few months"" it had coordinated the entry of ""close to 190,000 tents and tarpaulins directly to the residents of the Gaza Strip"". 
It said that ""in accordance with the terms of the agreement"" of the ceasefire, it was allowing ""hundreds of trucks carrying food, water, fuel, gas, medicines, medical equipment, tents, and shelter supplies [to] enter the Gaza Strip every day, in coordination with the UN, international organizations, donor countries, and the private sector"". 
On Sunday, Cogat wrote on X: ""We call on international organizations to coordinate more tents and tarpaulins and other winter humanitarian responses.""
It said it was working with the new US-led Civil-Military Coordination Center (CMCC) that had been set up in southern Israel and other international partners to plan ""a catered humanitarian response for the upcoming winter"".
International aid groups are hoping that the CMCC - which will oversee implementation of President Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan - will help ease restrictions on their work.
With a foreign donor conference on reconstruction in the Palestinian territory expected to take place in Egypt soon, they say basic shelter supplies must be allowed to enter while longer-term plans are developed.
""It would not be a good thing if all these nations meet in Cairo to discuss long-term reconstruction for Palestinians in great need if they die before their high-rise buildings can be reconstructed,"" says Mr Egeland, who was previously the UN's Emergency Relief Coordinator.  
""They need a tent today, they don't need a promise of a beachfront structure in five years.""
Palestinians have told the BBC that many tents - brought in by international agencies and Gulf donors - have been stolen and are available on the black market in Gaza.
They say that with a small increase in supply, prices have dropped from about $2,700 (2,330 euros; £2,050) before the ceasefire, to around $900-$1,000.
There are pleas for international help to distribute more shelters, more fairly.
""I hope everyone will join with us to end this crisis we're living through,"" says Alaa al-Dirghali in Khan Younis.  ""The tents endured two years under the sun and two years under the rain and they couldn't last this downpour.""
""Until this moment, people are re-erecting these broken tents because they don't have any alternative.  I pray to God that those responsible for handing out tents will give them to those who actually need them.  They're getting stolen and sold to people at a very expensive price.""
In Gaza City, Rami Deif Allah, who was displaced from Beit Hanoun, was drying out soaked mattresses in the weak sunshine, with his elderly mother and children.
He said a relative had given him a waterproof tent but that it was still flooded.
""We evacuated about 11 times and there was no safe place for us so we took shelter in these humble tents but it was all in vain. When the rain came they couldn't protect us,"" he said. ""The water flooded us from above and below.""
Like all Gazans, Rami longs for a permanent dwelling.
""We pray for this war to be fully over, and for everyone to return to their homes,"" he went on.  ""Even if we don't find our houses standing, with our sweat and blood we will rebuild. This situation of living out on the streets is unbearable.""
Correction 18 November 2025: An earlier version of this article mistakenly said NGO said 44,000 pallets of aid were being blocked from entering Gaza. The correct figure is 4,000.
Shahd Alhajjar, 22, says it is her goal to return to Gaza once her training is complete.
Included in the 20-point peace plan is the establishment of an International Stabilisation Force (ISF), which would work to demilitarise the territory.
Israel says South Africa had previously agreed to receive the 153 Palestinians who arrived last week.
A spokesperson  says the country expects ""everyone to stick to the agreements that have been made"".
The US draft authorises decommissioning Hamas weapons - though the group has not said it will disarm.

Bad weather is usually good business for companies that help people repair and rebuild. On the flip side, sales can suffer when the skies remain clear.
So it was for Home Depot, which said Tuesday that October's better-than-expected weather meant fewer shoppers came into its stores to spend in the third quarter.
""Our results were below our expectation, largely due to a lack of storms relative to historic norms,"" the retailer's head of merchandising, Billy Bastek, said on the third-quarter earnings call.
And not only has this year's weather been better than normal, last year was slightly worse than normal, which gave last year's numbers a lift and now makes year-over-year comparisons of Home Depot's sales look even tougher.
""We don't plan for storms per se, but there's, there's always some weather impact in the baseline,"" Home Depot CEO Ted Decker said on the call.
The executives also warned investors that fewer storms in one quarter also means fewer post-storm repairs in the next, so this year's fourth-quarter results could see a similar drag on sales.
""We're going to see even more quarter-over-quarter pressure from the storm activity,"" Decker said.
In addition to the hit to Home Depot's core retail business, the company also said the decrease in repair projects is contributing to softer sales at its recently acquired subsidiaries, GMS and SRS, which are distributors of specialty building and roofing supplies.
""SRS is much more in the re-roof than new construction,"" Decker said, ""which is why it's disproportionately impacted with storms, particularly in their home and biggest market, which is Texas.""
Setting aside the weather, Home Depot said the other pieces of the business continue to chug along as they have while the yearslong waiting game continues for a bounce-back in home improvement.
In short, some shoppers are still splashing out for higher-end appliances and tools, but many are deferring larger repair and renovation projects, especially if the project requires financing to complete.
Decker said that while contractors remain busy, job backlogs are starting to tick down, particularly for larger projects. And for many customers, factors like affordability, layoffs, and interest rates are still weighing on their decision to spend more.
""We still believe we have one of the healthiest consumer segments in the whole economy, but again, the economic uncertainty continues,"" Decker said.

Real estate's biggest turf war is playing out this week in a Manhattan courtroom, where a federal judge must decide if the so-called ""Zillow ban"" is fair.
Compass, the nation's largest real estate brokerage by sales volume, is fighting the ban, under which Zillow excludes home listings from its site and penalizes brokers when properties were previously listed as private ""exclusives"" elsewhere.
""A listing marketed to any buyer should be marketed to every buyer,"" Zillow, the nation's most popular online destination for home buyers, said in announcing the strict new policy in April.
Compass quickly sued to end the ban, arguing that it is monopolistic. On Tuesday, CEO and cofounder Robert Reffkin took the stand in hopes of convincing US District Judge Jeanette Vargas to temporarily halt the ban as the lawsuit plays out.
""I believe in choice versus control,"" Reffkin said on the stand, during questioning by Compass attorney Chahira Solh.
""I think consumers and sellers should have the choice of how their homes are marketed, and it should not be mandated and dictated by platforms,"" Reffkin said.
Closing arguments in the hearing are set for Friday. Vargas has not said when she will rule.
The ban — Zillow calls it a listing-access policy — bars home listings from its site if they've been selectively pre-marketed on another site instead of quickly shared through a multiple-listing service.
Under the new policy, once a listing has been banned from Zillow it can only be listed on the popular website if the home seller severs ties with their agent and brokerage.
""The agents are being intimidated,"" Reffkin told the judge. ""The agents are being bullied,"" he said. ""Because if they market a home off Zillow, then they're banned.""
Reffkin noted that his mother is a Compass broker who uses Zillow.
""If my mom gets kicked off of Zillow, the only way that the listing will get back on Zillow is if they fire my mom,"" Reffkin said. ""So my mom's terrified — absolutely terrified.""
On cross-examination, Zillow attorney Bonnie Lau tried to counter claims that the home-search site is a monopoly bent on ruining Compass' bottom line.
She confronted Reffkin with in-house emails in which he downplayed the ban's impact and Zillow's importance.
In an email from April displayed in the courtroom, Reffkin brainstormed with Compass Chief of Staff Will Hardy on how to assure client brokers that being on Zillow is — in Reffkin's words — ""not necessarily in their best interest.""
""Zillow has built its business around the illusion that it is essential to the home-selling process,"" Reffkin said in a May phone call to top Compass brokers, according to a transcript that was also shown in court.
Reffkin told his top brokers during the call that, according to Zillow's own numbers, only 3% of all home sales are Zillow transactions.
Compass listings that get banned from Zillow can still appear on other sites, such as Sotheby's and eXp, the attorney noted in her questioning.
""In fact, some sites, like Homes.com, have boosted a Compass listing that was impacted by Zillow's listing-access standards, correct?"" Lau asked.
""Homes.com has boosted some listings that were blocked by Zillow, but I don't think all,"" the CEO responded.
Zillow CEO Jeremy Wacksman is also slated to testify as the hearing continues.

GameStop 
Earlier this week, meme stock retailer turned PokÃ©mon card pawn shop, GameStop, announced a new trade-in stunt engineered to go viral. âTrade Anything Dayâ will let customers come in and hand over almost anything in exchange for store credit. Employees who werenât told about the promotional stunt in advance are already preparing for the worst. Some are even trying to harness the chaos for a good cause.Â 
GameStopâs official announcement says people can bring in their junk and trade it in on December 6 for credit toward games and other purchases as long as it doesnât violate a long list of exceptions. Those include hazardous materials, things that pose health risks, and Meta Quest VR headsets, for some reason. Trade-ins for stuff the stores normally accept will continue as usual.
But thatâs not the whole story. A flyer store employees received goes into more detail and explains exactly how âTrade Anything Dayâis supposed to work. Customers can only trade in one nonsense item that day. They only get $5 store credit, no matter what it is. At the very end, employees will be tasked with taking all of the qualifying items to local, approved donation drop-off points. Presumably everything else will be thrown out.Â 
Trade Anything Promotion Information byu/DuckSwimmer inGameStop

âWe’re getting so many calls already and people are being extra people-y already because they aren’t reading the rules,â one current employee told Kotaku. âThe problem has been lately that they drop this stuff on socials and we find out hours or days later.â
Other GameStop workers are already crashing out. âGod help us,â reads one thread on the r/gamestop subreddit. âIâm not prepared for the âbring anything to tradeâ day. I just know Iâm going to have to handle some nasty shit. And not only that, weâre probably going to have to reject some of the things because theyâre a biological hazard. I’m gonna have so many customers asking me âHoW cOmE yOu CaNât TaKe iT iN?â Cause we canât bro.â
The fact that all of the trade-ins have to be donated or thrown out has already inspired some stores to try and coax their customers into trading in canned goods and other non-perishables or toys that can be used for holiday gift drive charities. For some reason, GameStop isnât advertising that part of the promotion. Instead itâs making jokes about trading in taxidermy animals.
âA store next door to mine has a Toys for Tots bin, so we’re going to push for toys,â an employee told Kotaku. âA co-worker’s church is doing a coat and sweater drive so we’ll push for that. And we’ve talked to a couple of our regular PokÃ©mon collectors about bringing in a five-ish dollar card to join the collection of cards we give to kids who come in at my store and can’t get packs [because of scalpers].â
Theyâre hoping this can add a silver lining to what otherwise promises to be a messy day. While GameStop is infamous for its poor trade-in values, store employees are also used to dealing with unreasonable customers expecting top dollar for last yearâs Madden.

There's an artificial intelligence bubble you may not know about, and it could soon come for your electric bill.
The companies that provide the power to data centers are pushing regulators to approve massive spending increases for power plants and grid infrastructure. The electricity forecasts they're using to make their case have an inflation problem — and consumers could end up paying for power plants they may never need.
Many utilities are citing sky-high estimates to justify new AI data centers from Georgia to Texas and up to Minnesota. The catch? Data center operators submit electricity requests in multiple jurisdictions, hoping that one might pan out. Constellation Energy CEO Joseph Dominguez compared it to fishing: ""You put a bunch of lines in the water to try to catch fish,"" he said. ""And the data center developers are doing exactly the same thing.""
Think of it this way: A developer with plans for one new data center might go to five different utilities, each blind to the other requests. If the utility doesn't have enough capacity, it has to build another plant. Five power plants might get built, paid for with increases to current residential and commercial bills. By the time the developer finalizes its location, it has likely abandoned the other four, leaving new plants in places without increased demand.
While some regulators and utilities are cracking down, it remains a widespread practice — and concerns are now growing amid already rising electricity bills, experts said.
Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today.
The stakes are high. If utilities build too little, the reliability of the grid could be at risk. If utilities build too much, consumers could be saddled for decades with costs from idle power plants.
Utilities are ""investing in the grid and recovering those costs through rates,"" said Mark Dyson, a managing director with the Rocky Mountain Institute, a nonprofit focused on promoting market-based and sustainable energy solutions. ""They have a structural incentive to forecast demand growth in excess of what it is in order to recoup more returns.""
Few people expect the utilities to build enough generation for all the power demand they're forecasting, said Jeremy Fisher, a principal advisor to the Sierra Club with a decade of experience helping states and municipalities in energy resource planning. But in many cases, they are using these estimates to lobby state regulators.
""There's a real risk that we're already paying for some of that speculative load, or will be paying for that shortly,"" Fisher told Business Insider.
McKinsey estimates that data centers globally will require 219 gigawatts of electricity by 2030. Twenty-six of the country's largest investor-owned utilities, meanwhile, say they have data center projects that will require 711 gigawatts of electricity, according to estimates compiled by the Sierra Club — almost the same amount of power demanded by the continental US at its summer peak.
Why are utilities forecasting such lofty demand? The answer lies in the complex interplay of an energy system incentivized to build more power plants and the hundreds of billions of dollars at stake in the artificial intelligence boom.
Major players like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta aren't directly building most data centers. Instead, construction lies with a series of middlemen that hope to flip the properties to one of the large tech companies or their smaller peers.
Everyone from mom-and-pop operators to established real estate development companies is scrambling to capture a slice of the rewards.
Each player takes its project to the utility and asks for electricity. Many are doing it in multiple jurisdictions in the hopes that one of their projects will be able to secure the necessary power, according to experts and industry sources. Utilities then take these requests and conduct feasibility studies if they find them credible.
""We know from conversations with our customers and end users that the same data center need is being considered in multiple jurisdictions across the United States at the same time,"" Constellation Energy's Dominguez said.
Many of those requests don't end up going anywhere, said Astrid Atkinson, the cofounder of grid efficiency software provider Camus Energy and a former Google data center engineer. ""Any developer is going to want to have a few options,"" she said. ""And then as those sites get further through their life cycle, some of them are going to make it and some of them are not.""
Atkinson, who frequently speaks to data center developers and builders, estimated that there may be between five and 10 times the demand to connect to the grid as there will be data centers built.
Some developers are aware of the issue. ""We're not just going around dropping load requests in the 19 markets because that's not prudent; people wouldn't return our phone calls,"" said Ryan Mallory, the CEO at Flexential, a data center operator with 42 facilities that's backed by Morgan Stanley. ""There are companies that do that — some newer developers are out there carpet bombing markets, and that creates a tense situation for everybody.""
The push for power to meet data center demand is further complicated by the fact that there aren't enough semiconductor chips to use the power. Nvidia and AMD — whose graphics processing units are the backbone of AI computing, and typically account for more than half of a data center's energy use — will produce enough GPUs for 5 gigawatts of computing power this year, growing to 9.5 gigawatts by 2028, according to Enverus, an energy market data analysis and consulting firm.
Even assuming that data centers require twice that amount of electricity to cool servers, keep the lights on, and perform other tasks, that's only around 19 gigawatts of power demand. There aren't close to enough GPU chips in the world to use the power utilities say they need to provide.
""The market's pretty smart, at least for the next year or two, about what actual GPU production is going to be,"" said Carson Kearl, an analyst at Enverus, which based its estimates on Wall Street's revenue forecasts and the assumed revenue from each chip. ""That sort of quantity is extremely detached from what the queues are suggesting.""
Data centers represent a new growth opportunity for utilities, which have faced flat or declining electricity demand for decades due to efficiency gains in things like lighting.
Researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab recently found that data centers accounted for 4.4% of total US electricity in 2023, a share that may climb to between 6.7% to 12% by 2030. Other industries, such as electric vehicles, have also contributed to growing electricity demand.
Through 2024, there were 1,240 data centers planned or operating in the US, according to a Business Insider investigation published earlier this year. If every permitted facility came online, their electricity demand could reach between 149.6 terawatt-hours and 239.3 terawatt-hours annually, Business Insider found. The low end of the estimate is roughly equivalent to the state of Ohio's electricity needs in 2023, and, on the high end, nearly as much power as the entire state of Florida the same year. A 2024 federal report projected demand could reach levels at the higher end of Business Insider's estimates by 2026.
New power plants generating more electricity are likely necessary to power the AI boom, experts at McKinsey and Deloitte say. The question is how much power is needed.
Grid Strategies releases an annual report looking at just that question. In December 2024, the firm said two regions led the pack that year in the size of the updates they made to their five-year forecasts for electricity demand. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas, known as ERCOT, added nearly 37 gigawatts to its forecast; the PJM Interconnection, which covers parts of 13 states, including the data center capital of the world in Virginia, added more than 15 gigawatts.
Those forecasts aggregate estimates from utilities, which have historically been biased toward forecasting more load growth than what's actually needed.
In February, the Rocky Mountain Institute published a report noting that between 2012 and 2023, on average, utilities overestimated demand by 23%.
Each utility brings an individualized approach to estimating load growth. Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities based a request to spend $3 billion on two new gas plants on 6 gigawatts of demand from data center projects it has in the queue, according to documents submitted to state regulators.
Only one of the 18 data center projects in its service area was found to have a ""high probability"" of locating there, according to the companies' March response to regulators, and none of the projects had signed a contract. Nonetheless, the utility said it thought that 1.75 gigawatts, or nearly 30% of the total, would get built.
In October, state officials signed off on the expansion.
Drew Gardner, a spokesperson for the Kentucky utilities, which operate jointly, said ""we disagree with this characterization of our generation investment plans and how we operate as regulated utilities,"" adding that the two new plants will ""support our ability to continue serving customers safely and reliably, while keeping pace with Kentucky's record-breaking economic development needs."" The forecast for record-breaking growth ""is not dependent on any one customer or project.""
Others, like Dominion Energy, which serves Virginia's ""Data Center Alley,"" discount more speculative requests. In a hearing in front of the North Carolina Utilities Commission last month, Dominion officials said the company had about 54 data center customers, and another 50 or so speculative customers, real estate developers or other individuals, with little substantive experience.
""We're not convinced that that's going to increase actual data center demand,"" a Dominion representative said in the hearing. ""It's just competition, everybody competing for a growing slice of the pie.""
Aaron Ruby, a Dominion spokesperson, said that at Dominion, demand has exceeded the forecast ""for several years."" When asked if that was because of data centers, Ruby responded after publication, ""Of course it is.""
He added that Dominion bases its ""long-term power generation planning on PJM's load forecast, not our own. We independently validate the forecast by comparing it to the load we have under contract with our customers,"" he said. ""They consistently match up, which gives confidence in their accuracy.""
John Wilson, the Grid Strategies vice president who prepared the report on load growth, acknowledged that utilities have an upward bias, but ascribed a lot of the inflated estimates to a need for new load-demand forecasting methods. Until about three years ago, he said, utilities used population and economic growth to forecast future load. Now, 80% or more of their forecasts are for large loads like data centers — electricity demands so new, large, and uncertain that the previous methods aren't adequate.
""There's a lot of room for improvement,"" said Wilson. Utilities have motivation to inflate forecasts, he said, but ""the reasons for those biases have to do with real challenges to getting those forecasts right.""
One way to remove some of the more speculative requests, according to experts, is to increase the financial disincentives for developers to submit multiple requests. In July, Ohio's public utilities commissions approved a settlement that requires data centers to pay for at least 85% of the electricity they say they need, even if they use less.
In September, after the new rules went into effect, American Electric Power Ohio said it had gotten requests totaling 13 gigawatts of potential new load, less than half the 30 gigawatts of demand that it cited during the rule-making process.
The Ohio settlement was one of the first of many new regulations, known as large load tariffs, now being considered in the wake of data center electricity demands. There are at least 20 under consideration across the US, including one that Dominion has proposed, according to the Sierra Club. After publication, Dominion said its regulators would make a decision on its large-load tariff ""later this month.""
Still, some electricity customers are seeing costs skyrocket. Customers who buy electricity from the regional electric grid managed by PJM will have to pay $7.3 billion more for electricity thanks to data center concerns, according to a consulting firm that works with PJM. The total auction for future electricity supplies was a record $16.1 billion this year, up from the previous high of $14.7 billion set last year.
""The basic conclusion of this analysis is that data center load growth is the primary reason for recent and expected capacity market conditions,"" the firm wrote in its report, ""including total forecast load growth, the tight supply and demand balance, and high prices.""
The Sierra Club's Fisher said many stakeholders are beginning to wake up. ""What we're starting to see is that both other ratepayer advocates, and commissions, and some utilities, are concerned about that potential for cross-subsidization"" of data center costs to other customers, Fisher said. Rules like Ohio's are ""a mechanism of trying to block speculative customers or at least curtail speculative load,"" he said.
""I would count that as a success.""

85,2025-11-18,"It’s not what Beer connoisseurs expected at all, because they’ve had to endure the unenjoyable experience of watching their favorite taprooms and breweries close their doors over the past two years due to economic troubles that have plagued the industry.
So far, the reasoning has been the same across the board: inflation and tariffs, consumers choosing a healthier lifestyle over drinking alcohol, and heightened industry competition. 
According to the Brewers Association’s 2025 Midyear Market report released in July 2025, craft brewery closings have beaten openings throughout the year. As of June, 9,269 breweries were still operating, down 1% compared to 9,352 in June 2024. 
Also, the number of craft breweries dropped like a rock from 2024 and 2023, per the report. The number of operating craft breweries fell across the nation to 9,680 in 2024, which was down from 9,747 in 2023. 
Though a few breweries that have shut down filed for bankruptcy before shuttering operations, others closed their doors without even filing a petition. 
All that being said, not every craft brewery and taproom closing is a dead giveaway of financial hardship and economic troubles. 
One great example is FX Matt Brewing Co., which is set to close its Flying Bison Brewing Company taproom in Buffalo, N.Y., on Nov. 29, after the brand was sold, as all recipes and trademarks went to Hamburg Brewing Co. 
The brands owned by FX Matt Brewing Co. include: 
Since the sale, Hamberg Brewing will take over the manufacturing of Flying Bison’s beers and it plans to continue producing and distributing the brand. 
“Flying Bison has deep roots in Buffalo’s brewing history, and we’re proud of the role we played in supporting and sustaining that heritage over the past 15 years,” Fred Matt, president and CEO of FX Matt Brewing Company, said in a statement within the release.
“Hamburg Brewing is a respected and community-focused craft brewery with a strong presence in Western New York. We’re confident they’re the right partner to carry the Flying Bison legacy forward,” he added. 
Established in 2013, the Hamburg, N.Y.-based buyer is a family-owned brewery, which now features Flying Bison in its Hamburg taproom. Customers can purchase cans or bottles, which are still available at the same retailers who carried the brand before the sale went through.

It’s not every week that Jacoby Brissett leads the NFL in passing yards (just ahead of Bryce Young) — or that Brissett sets an NFL record for completions. But it’s Week 11 and things are starting to get weird. Let’s lean into the unusual performances — the ones where the stats belie what’s actually happening. Let’s dive beneath the surface-level box scores.
In these QB rankings, I’m focused on monitoring the fluctuations of a quarterback’s performance throughout the season. No one — not even Matthew Stafford — is safe at the top. No one — not even Justin Fields — is stuck at the bottom. There is room for quick ascent — and rapid decline. One question holds most important: What have you done for your team lately?
Previous: Preseason, Week 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
In his past three games, Love has averaged 207.7 passing yards, 0.6 touchdowns and 0.6 interceptions while completing 60.8% of his throws. Over that span, coach Matt LaFleur fielded a question about whether he feels he’s playing for his job. Over that span, the Packers are 1-2.
Over that span, I remain rooted in my belief that Love is among the NFL’s best quarterbacks.
He is a microcosm of counting stats versus advanced stats. Because as ugly as those numbers are above, he sits tied atop the NFL in EPA/play (alongside Drake Maye). I’m not saying the Packers are going to make the deep playoff run that many expected following the Micah Parsons trade. I’m just saying that Love is a major part of why they’re still winning games.
This isn’t the guy who was missing easy throws like he did last year. His incompletions are, on occasion, more impressive than most middling QB’s completions. Watch the game. Not the box score. You’ll have a great time watching Love.
He completed 37.8% of his passes for … 255 yards?
There are a lot of parts about this game that feel inexplicable — and hard to reconcile in terms of analyzing where the Lions go from here. But let’s start with a few truths from this game:
So … now what?
There are elements of this game that the Lions can address — and then turn into an outlier. The Eagles seemed to get unsustainably lucky (with all the tipped passes) and the Lions got unlucky (with drops).
There was one element they cannot chalk up as an outlier: Goff’s issue with pressure is a common theme this year. And frankly, every year.
It’s one thing for a quarterback to struggle under pressure. Patrick Mahomes does. Tom Brady did. Every QB does. It’s another thing for that pressure to single-handedly take down the offense. That’s what happened Sunday night for the Lions.
This year is worse than other years for Goff.
In 2025, Goff has completed 45.8% of his passes (44/96) against pressure. His completion percentage over expected is -5.1%, his EPA per dropback is -.48 and his success percentage is 31.1%. Those are all career lows against pressure. To make matters worse, the Lions are surrendering pressure on 35.5% of Goff’s dropbacks, the second-highest rate of his Detroit tenure. More or less, there’s more pressure than ever and he’s handling it worse than ever.
It will be on head coach Dan Campbell — who's doubling as the offensive playcaller — to figure out how to 1) help his OL prevent pressure and then 2) help Goff handle that pressure more comfortably. 
Because it might just be the Lions offense’s single biggest problem.
What quarterback controversy?
Purdy did what Purdy is supposed to do — feed his playmakers. No turnovers. Three touchdowns. And a completion percentage over expected of +7%. 
Squeaky clean efficiency — so clean that there might not be any mention of Mac Jones until the offseason, when he’ll inevitably get entrenched in trade rumors.
For the first time in what feels like forever, Purdy, running back Christian McCaffrey and tight end George Kittle are healthy at the same time. So is wideout Ricky Pearsall. We’re just waiting for fellow receiver Brandon Aiyuk — but don’t hold your breath (and it probably won’t matter that much). Purdy looked like the quick-thinking, quick-moving point guard that the 49ers have needed. That’s not even the best news. The best news is that, even without him for the bulk of the season, they’re 7-4 and have an 87% chance of making the postseason, per the New York Times simulator. 
The pressure is off Purdy. The team is healthy. (And both things are important because the pressure to carry the team proved too much for Purdy last year.) 
Things are actually looking up for San Francisco. At this time last year, I wondered if the 49ers' championship window was closing. At this time last year, people wondered if coach Kyle Shanahan and/or GM John Lynch might end up somewhere else in 2027, whether by trade or otherwise. (And then Purdy would probably get displaced, too.)
Nope. Not happening.
This isn’t to say it’s going to be all roses and the 49ers are going to win the Super Bowl. But it’s refreshing to see the 49ers’ best players healthy and playing together. We’ll perhaps see what this 2025 club is really made of in the final three weeks of the season, when the Niners close out at Indianapolis, and then at home versus the Bears and the Seahawks. We'll know then whether they can make a deep run in the NFC.
Yes, this does happen every year.
Darnold is the king of meltdown games. Even as he has grown into a reliable NFL starter, he has not shaken his once-a-year propensity to put up a catastrophic performance. He has three four-interception games in his career and six three-interception games. The only season when he has not thrown three or more interceptions in a single game was in 2023 (backup in San Francisco) and 2022 (initially a backup, only to start six games in Carolina).
But this wasn’t just a Darnold-will-be-Darnold game.
He fell right into the Rams’ plan to trigger the meltdown. Darnold and Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula have the type of relationship that Bill Belichick once had with Darnold. (Remember when Darnold infamously admitted to ""seeing ghosts""?) Shula isn’t playing cat and mouse with Darnold — they’re playing predator and prey, with the DC operating one step ahead of the QB. 
The last time they squared off, Darnold took nine sacks in the Vikings’ playoff defeat to the Rams. It was clear Darnold’s priority this past Sunday was not to take all those sacks. Whether or not Shula knew that at the beginning, he and his defenders figured it out quickly. They did not blitz Darnold, instead forcing him to process the movements of the seven defensive backs in coverage — but with that ticking clock in the back of his head. 
You could almost hear Darnold wondering: How long until Jared Verse gets home?
""The rush contains him, and he wants to get rid of the ball, and he’s flinching up,"" Rams safety Kam Kinchens said, via The Athletic. ""He don’t want to get sacked. He’s just trying to get the ball out of his hands, so that’s when I knew there was an opportunity.""
Ironically, it would’ve been better if Darnold had just taken the sacks. Because all four of his turnovers were his fault and if he’d taken those sacks, the Seahawks probably would’ve won because of better field position.
OK, now I’m about to head into left field, so bear with me. There’s a saying about World War II, which was that the Allies struggled at the outset because they were fighting the last war (World War I). They expected the Germans to arrive with the same plan of war. The Germans had new plans. Football is not war. But hopefully, you see my point: You can’t win your next game by simply fixing the mistakes of your previous one.
Darnold cannot expect Shula to return with the same plan, if these two teams see each other again. Darnold won’t rectify his problems by taking the sacks. He and OC Klint Kubiak need to play catch-up with a Rams defense that’s multiple steps ahead.
Best quote of the year goes to … Adam Trautman. Tight end. Broncos.
""First off, if you’re talking s--- about Bo online, you’re a coward. Absolute coward. But – I just want to say that, and guard him a little bit,"" Trautman told reporters this past Sunday. ""He blanks it out, and we talked about it this week. We don’t care what other people think. We know what we have in the building, and we know what he’s made of, and we don’t really care what people have to say. So, DragonSlayer69, with the 7-Eleven Slurpee in his mom’s basement, I don’t give a s--- what he has to say, right? And Bo doesn’t either.""
Perfect. That means I — DragonSlayer69 — am now free to evaluate Nix. But it’s too bad he and Trautman aren’t reading (even though… they must be reading if they know people are criticizing). But I digress.
Nix is a system quarterback. He is only as good as his playcaller. And about halfway through the third quarter, coach Sean Payton figured out how to maximize his quarterback and, in turn, his offense. The key was clear: abandon all intermediate passing.
Payton dialed up plays to allow Nix to uncork downfield passes. Payton dialed up receiver, running back and tight end screens. He stopped asking Nix to throw into the teeth of the defense. Because the Chiefs' defense was too good in the middle of the field.
But guess what? It worked. Nix attacked downfield and got chunk plays. His pass-catchers kept the offense on schedule with YAC off screens. And the Broncos' defense held up its end of the bargain. So Denver beat the Chiefs and took control of the AFC West.
It must’ve been hard for Nix to wait and let the game come to him. But eventually, it did. He seized his opportunities.
The great part about Young’s performance was how much help he got. That’s been the systemic problem in Carolina, with no supporting cast from coach to receivers to offensive line. That’s how Baker Mayfield and Sam Darnold cruised through the organization without realizing their potential. That’s how Young could easily exit the organization without ever realizing his.
But we saw him throw for 448 passing yards and three touchdowns largely off the merits of others. Young looked like what I originally thought J.J. McCarthy would look like — a young, smaller point-guard passer whose supporting cast elevates him.
Young made a few high-difficulty throws, whether it was the tight-window throw rolling left and zipping it into the hands of wideout Xavier Legette — or the pinpoint deep ball to Legette for a touchdown. 
But in all, Young attempted tight-window throws on just 11% of his passes, the fourth-lowest number of the season, per Next Gen Stats. He also had a receiver wide open on 31.1% of his passes, the second highest of the season.
Yes, Young played well. But most importantly, coach Dave Canales schemed up a game plan that sprung Legette, WR Tetairoa McMillan, RB Rico Dowdle and even TE Tommy Tremble to big games.
This type of performance is huge for Young, who is playing for his job in 2026. It’s not new, per se. We’ve seen him have a steady hand for one-game spurts — and even eight-game runs (looking at the second half of last year). What we haven’t seen is a greater body of consistent work for a whole season. He won’t put up these kinds of numbers every week, obviously, but this is the style of play that he needs to demonstrate through the season and, perhaps, into the playoffs.
Or someone else will be the Panthers' QB next year.

The stock market sell-off in recent days has tripped a number of warning signals that point to more pain ahead for investors. 
The tech sell-off stretched into a fourth session on Tuesday, declining on a cocktail of worries while the market also flashes several red flags for investors to be wary of. 
The S&P 500 crossed a key technical level that could hint at more weakness to come. The benchmark index dropped below its 50-day moving average on Tuesday — the first time it's done so over the last 138 trading sessions. 
The 50-day moving average is an important technical threshold, and the recent decline ends the S&P 500's longest streak of trading above the 50-day moving average since 2007, Deutsche Bank said on Tuesday.
The signal could be a sign that more selling pressure is on the way, Rosenberg Research wrote. 
""Looks like a test of the April low is on the table,"" the research firm said. The index falling back to its low in early April implies the S&P 500 falling 27% from its current level of 6,579 on Tuesday morning. The firm said that 6,550 is the next level it is watching. 
Adam Turnquist, the chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, also said stocks could retest the 6,550 mark after breaking below the key 50-day moving average. 
""While history suggests this break isn't inherently bearish, the index also fell below the lower boundary of its rising price channel yesterday. Key downside support now sits near the November lows at 6,631 and October lows at 6,550,"" he wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.
But that isn't the only sell signal that is flashing right now. 
The crossing of the closely watched technical threshold has coincided with another warning sign in stocks: investors are holding onto ""very low"" levels of cash, Bank of America said in a report on Tuesday.
Global fund managers surveyed by the bank had an average cash level of 3.7%. That's a ""sell-signal"" in stocks, analysts wrote. 
""Note cash levels of 3.7% or lower has occurred 20 times since 2002, and on every occasion stocks fell and Treasurys outperformed in the following 1-3 months,"" the bank wrote.
Talk of a coming stock market correction has grown louder in recent weeks as tech stocks have come under pressure. A mix of valuation concerns and worries about the health of the AI trade have fanned fears in the market. Nvidia is down about 7% in five days as it gets ready to report earnings on Wednesday, while the Nasdaq is inching toward a correction. 
Worries about a broader pullback were stoked in recent week by top bank executives, who said they wouldn't be surprised if stocks dropped sharply in the near to medium term. 
Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said a drawdown of up to 20% in stocks was ""likely"" over the next 12 to 24 months.
Morgan Stanley's CEO, Ted Pick, also said he believed a 15% drawdown in stocks was possible, though such a drop would be a positive development for the market after a yearslong rally. 
Speaking to Bloomberg this week, Daniel Pinto, JPMorgan's Vice Chairman, said he believed a correction in AI stocks would ""probably"" occur in the future. Grace Peters, the co-head of global investment strategy at JPMorgan Private Bank, also told the outlet said she believed a correction of as much as 8% would be ""not unhealthy.""

92,2025-11-18,"A conversation with ESSEC Business School’s Srividya Jandhyala on how to navigate the shifting geopolitical landscape.
Geopolitics are no longer a tailwind for businesses today, opening markets and boosting global trade. Instead, argues ESSEC Business School associate professor Srividya Jandhyala, rising national security concerns and protectionist economic policies have created a headwind for many organizations, and that’s changing how executives need to operate. She explains what’s changed in the global balance of power, how it’s affecting even small to medium-sized companies and unexpected industries —from shrimp farming to fast fashion —and why leaders need new talent and risk management strategies to adapt.  Jandhyala is the author of the book The Great Disruption.
ALISON BEARD: I’m Alison Beard.
ADI IGNATIUS: And I’m Adi Ignatius, and this is the HBR IdeaCast.
ALISON BEARD: Adi, there’s a lot of fear and anxiety among corporate leaders right now over changing geopolitical dynamics and economic policies, particularly when it comes to trade and immigration. We see lots of opinions about how much it’s going to affect different types of businesses and what executives should be doing about it. So, today, we’re going to talk to a researcher who has lived all over the world, and studied these issues, and believes that the best way to navigate is with what she calls corporate diplomacy.
ADI IGNATIUS: I like that. We’ve written pieces in the past about how every company needs a foreign policy. And with all the uncertainty around trade, around supply chains, the market for talent, various policies, this level of uncertainty is making it tougher to lead. So, if you’ve got somebody who understands this, who can identify high-level trends, and tell us what to do about it, I am all ears.
ALISON BEARD: Our guest today is Srividya Jandhyala, an associate professor at ESSEC Business School, whose life and career have taken her from India to the U.S. and U.K., and now Singapore. She’ll explain how geopolitics have gone from being a tailwind to a headwind for most companies, why even small and mid-sized businesses are affected, and how organizations should rethink their structures and talent strategies in this context.
She’s the author of the book, The Great Disruption: How Geopolitics is Changing Companies, Managers, and Work. That’s Srividya Jandhyala, Associate Professor at ESSEC Business School, and an author of the book, The Great Disruption: How Geopolitics is Changing Companies, Managers, and Work.
Politics and geopolitics have always had a really big impact on how businesses decide to invest and operate. So what is different now?
SRIVIDYA JANDHYALA: It’s always been true that politics and geopolitics plays an important role in how companies operate. I think what’s different is 20 years ago for many companies, not all, but for many companies, geopolitics was actually a driving force, a tailwind, if you will. So it was opening new markets, it was creating new opportunities. Companies suddenly were finding new places that they could invest in and new ways of making money. I think what many companies are now discovering is that that’s actually becoming a headwind in some ways.
If you think about the largest companies and the people who are leading those companies, they came of age in a very different time. They probably went to business school 15, 20 years ago when they learned how to read a financial statement and learn marketing, but there were very few courses, on how to deal with politics or geopolitics. And nothing in their experience really set them up well to deal with the flux that we are seeing today.
ALISON BEARD: What is changing about the world order from your perspective as a global citizen who’s been in all the different geographies?
SRIVIDYA JANDHYALA: Definitely in the past, there was clearly a single center of gravity. The United States with all its advantages for a lot of economic activity was that center of gravity. What we have seen over the last 25 years or so is that that center of gravity has been shifting and there’s more competition and there’s more all kinds of resources. So whether it’s people, technology, just traditional types of resources.
And we’ve seen that more distributed across multiple places. We’ve seen the rise of China, we’ve seen middle powers also becoming more salient in this context. And so I think there’s been a general shift in how relative positioning of countries, but we’ve seen that center of gravity move a little bit towards the east in the last 25 years or so. More I think, also everybody, all of these actors are becoming much more cognizant of their relative positioning, and that’s creating a lot of national security issues.
ALISON BEARD: Right. And protectionist policies.
SRIVIDYA JANDHYALA: Protectionist policies for many reasons. So some of it is just nationalistic policies, but some of those are also really closely tied to national security to the extent that we don’t want certain types of technologies or certain industries or sectors to be driven by foreign actors or that we don’t want foreign companies to have control over certain segments of the domestic economy, their ability to repatriate rents and build advantages at home rather than in the countries where they’re generating those rents. I think that’s been a very big issue of contention for many countries.
ALISON BEARD: Can you give me a few examples of how this is playing out in maybe unexpected ways, not just for large global companies, but also for small to medium-sized businesses?
SRIVIDYA JANDHYALA: So, let’s say if you’re a shrimp farmer in India, you had a huge market in the United States. What was a relative advantage for this small farmer or a small agricultural company in Southern India has now with the imposition of tariffs on a lot of Indian exports has now become a massive disadvantage relative to their competitors in other countries. So a shrimp farmer from Ecuador now faces different tariff rates than that of their competitors in India. And I think, what used to be, what we strive to in the past, a more level playing field, but we are seeing now that that’s becoming more uneven, based on where the companies is located or where what I call the corporate nationality of the company.
And that in some sense is the defining feature of how geopolitics is impacting companies. Whether you have an advantage or a disadvantage. And that corporate nationality can also quickly turn from a disadvantage to an advantage or the other way around.
ALISON BEARD: And how do you see this affecting how senior leaders are doing their jobs?
SRIVIDYA JANDHYALA: So for one thing, everybody’s scrambling to keep up right now. I just trying to figure out what are the latest issues that I need to be aware of and how do I keep updated with what’s going on in the business environment, in the competitive space. And so I think there’s a lot of, we have to keep up with what’s happening right now in terms of what is today’s startup rate or do I need to think about how I adjust my supply chain today, which a lot of companies are doing and they’re doing it relatively well. But the second order effect, if you will, is thinking about what they need to compete in global markets.
And what I mean by that is companies want to make sure that when they invest in a foreign market, that market access is something that they have a fair degree of confidence in, that they feel like they’re competing on a level playing field, that they are facing the same set of conditions or similar constraints as their competitors do. They want to be sure that their investments are safe and secure, whether this is their physical investments, whether this is their financial investments, or whether this is their human capital and the employees that they have over there.
And they also want to be sure that the cost of doing business in a different location is manageable. So if you end up having too many different Balkanized systems, standards, institutions, that makes it really challenging for companies to expand and compete in international markets. So while companies are adjusting to the short-term tariffs or challenges to supply chains, there is this kind of second order effects where they have to think about what is the kind of institutional infrastructure that I need to be able to invest in another market, to be able to compete in international markets.
And so the analogy I like to use is that of a game of Jenga. So if you have these little blocks and you build up a tower with those blocks, you can start knocking out blocks one by one and the tower still stands, right?. You take out a few more, it starts wobbling a little bit, but at some point the tower will collapse.
ALISON BEARD: You make the point in your book that it’s not just these large global businesses. It might be an importer of toys. It might be a European paint company that depends on a specific ingredient that is now part of a trade war. And also, I think that in certain countries like the United States, there’s drastic policy changes that are also affecting the way companies can make decisions about where they’re going to invest. So is it even possible to  analyze the competitive landscape and make long-term strategy in this current environment?
SRIVIDYA JANDHYALA: So I would say I agree with you that there’s lots of different types of companies. Traditionally, we used to think of geopolitics as affecting companies in the defense sector, companies in the oil sector, what we thought of as critical industries, right? But what we are seeing today is a slightly different landscape, if you will, where toy companies or Hollywood movies or any kind of paint manufacturing, these types of things that we don’t generally tend to associate with the classic industries that would be affected by geopolitics.
Why is it that a teenager making a video on TikTok or somebody who’s buying fast fashion clothing is suddenly in the midst of this kind of national security issues? I think companies have to, doesn’t matter if you’re big or small, if you’re in any way a global competitor, if you’re any way looking at partners in other countries or investments in other locations, or even if you are a purely domestic company but have supply chains that may be coming from other countries. And today that’s probably almost all companies, whether it’s a direct supplier or an indirect supplier. Everybody is looking at the landscape fundamentally they’re really worried about those four things. So to what extent will we continue to have market access? To what extent are we competing on a level playing field? How secure are in any investments that we make? And what is the cost of doing business?
And the reality is different companies look at the same landscape and they walk away with very different interpretations. For some companies, they see opportunities. They see ways of creating value. They are using the flux.. And others look at this exact same landscape and see that more as a threat to their business model. And they have to adapt and they have to figure out how to change. And in some ways, large companies are an advantage because they are the ones who are able to scan the landscape. They can invest in political resources. They can figure out how they can allocate teams around the world. But on the other hand, large companies are also notoriously difficult to change.
So if they do decide that they need a different strategy or if they need to compete on different aspects of their business, it’s exactly those large companies that are going to be really hard to pull that off. So I do think there’s space also for startups, small companies, SMEs that are going to find it much easier to shift the conversation or change their strategies or adapt their internal organization.
ALISON BEARD: Yeah. So it sounds like you’re saying that to plan for the long-term companies both need to sort of analyze the landscape, think about lots of future scenarios, and then be willing to adapt depending on what happens.
SRIVIDYA JANDHYALA: Certainly. I think scanning the environment is probably the first step, but a lot of the work comes after you scan the environment, which is how do you take that information that you get from the environment? How do you personalize it to your company? Take what is relevant.
If there’s a new policy or if there’s a new tariff rate, companies have to personalize that and figure out to what extent it’s relevant to their business, to what extent it’s something that they need to adapt to. And they have to figure out a response. So they’re gaming out different scenarios and trying to figure out what are the different scenarios in which I’m going to have large impact versus small impact.
ALISON BEARD: Yeah. One step that you advocate for on the scanning front is actually hiring former diplomats. What do you think that they can teach C-suite leaders about how to navigate all of these changes?
SRIVIDYA JANDHYALA: So one thing that I think diplomats really bring is just their ability to read the room and them having been in situations before. Maybe they were in the room when decisions were being made. Maybe they understand the policymaking process. So I think what the unique skills that they bring are their ability to break down the policy process, their ability to identify which way maybe the winds are blowing, to figure out how they can use that information to advise their clients or top managers in terms of what they should be prepared for. I think they’re also really good at potentially getting the right people in the room, making connections, just for, decision makers to be able to have a good idea of, “I, I understand what’s happening and I feel like I’m in a better position to make a decision for my company.”
And that’s certainly very, very helpful for companies, especially those that haven’t really been spending a lot of time thinking about these types of issues in the past., if you take a company like Nvidia, Jensen Huang, the CEO was famously not involved in politics before. He would rather hang out with the video gamers in California than spend time in DC, but Mr. Huang is kind of finding out that he actually is a pretty much a corporate diplomat. So I think that they really have to retool, I think the capabilities or what got them to the top is not necessarily the same set of skills that they need to have today. And I think pharma diplomats are one avenue or one source of information that can help them with what they need.
ALISON BEARD: Yeah. And lobbying does seem to be a big piece of this. We can’t talk about politics without talking about that. How do companies with smaller budgets curry favor? And then also how do larger ones like the Nvidias or the Microsofts or the Facebooks of the world, how do they walk the line between legitimate lobbying and what might seem to the outside like exerting sort of undue influence through campaign donations or investing in the business interests of political leaders?
SRIVIDYA JANDHYALA: I mean, I think that has been a tricky question for companies throughout time companies have always had to walk this fine line between how do we advocate for our interests while making sure that this is done in a fair way, that it doesn’t create adverse consequences in other spaces. And so I think that’s an ongoing challenge for many companies. What I would say is certainly I think some of the larger companies have much bigger budgets, a lot more people. They have access to the best diplomats. They have access to the best consulting firms and they can be-
ALISON BEARD: They get invited to the state dinners.
SRIVIDYA JANDHYALA: -in the room to influence the policy much more, the dinners. but I also, when I think about it, there’s, again, a second order effect, which is they’re spending so much time, energy and resources, managerial resources in trying to figure out this policy space and trying to advocate for their own interests.
And that used to be energy and managerial attention that used to be spent on something else. So when they weren’t doing this, they were investing in products or they were fine-tuning their operations or their supply chains or paying more attention to their customers. The research kind of shows that when companies are distracted by other things, then their regular operations tends to be negatively impacted.
ALISON BEARD: What other new types of talent or skills do companies need in this new environment?
SRIVIDYA JANDHYALA: In some ways, the scanning part is the easy part. That’s the part that outsiders can help you, whether it’s diplomats, whether it is consulting companies, analysts, the scanning part is the part that they can … You can get some support, you can rely on other actors to help you with that.
I think the internal part is the one that is more complicated. Companies having to figure out what to do with that information. How is it going to impact their different businesses? How is it going to change the way they operate? And when they look at that information, looking at different scenarios, gaming out different scenarios, trying to understand the risk management strategies, the scenario planning, all of that stuff.
And so I think really being imaginative and trying to understand the different aspects of what is going on is a skill that certainly companies will need to invest more in and really breaking down what we see on the outside into interpreting how is this going to impact my operations in the long run or the way I compete, my basic competitive advantage into the future, I think those are the kinds of challenges that companies would have to invest in.
ALISON BEARD: Yeah. So if someone with sort of the diplomatic scanning networking skills is sort of one type of new person you need in the company, are there other types of new people that you need?
SRIVIDYA JANDHYALA: So one, we are seeing also a big growth in quantitative analysts, for example, who are able to collate big data, run different types of simulation models, try to understand game different scenarios. I. And thinking about the implications of geopolitics s, even the companies that used to think about politics really didn’t think about politics in a way that was central to their business. It was usually like you had the government affairs team that used to run off and do their own thing, but that was never really well integrated into the company’s strategy making.
And so I think that’s another change that companies are probably going to have to think about because this conduit, government affairs is well positioned to bring you the information and understand how it’s impacting your company, but if they’re not at the table, that’s a lost opportunity. So if they’re not part of the strategy making, if you don’t have like an integrated strategy making within the firm that’s bringing in these types of information, that’s I think also a way to look at this.
ALISON BEARD: Are there other structural changes that you think organizations will need to make or you see them making?
SRIVIDYA JANDHYALA: So there’s one big change in terms of organization. Global companies, companies are thinking about issues like where do I put my staff? Which offices, which locations, what type of work are these people going to do? And I think there’s a big element of trying to figure out what am I competing on and how am I organized to compete on those aspects? So if you think about companies like Microsoft, for example, they had a challenging time trying to figure out what to do with, for example, their research center in China. So a lot of companies invested lots of money investing in R&D labs and research centers around the world and they’re now kind of taking a step back or trying to ask, well, should they be as internationalized as they used to be in the past?
Are we going to put them in some countries and not in other countries? Do they all have to be at home? How do we balance and navigate this trade-off between having access to the diverse knowledge that really gives us innovative, truly innovative products versus having a tighter control, having more oversight of the types of activities that different teams are doing. . And then the last part I think is really, this is impacting the nature of work itself. So the idea of, for example, remote work or work from anywhere, the promise was that it would democratize work, that anybody anywhere with the right kind of skills would be able to tap into the system. As long as you had a laptop and Wi-Fi, you should be good.
That was the promise. And I think the technology might allow it, but the geopolitics is increasingly showing that that’s probably not the case, that even if you can do it, you probably are not going to be allowed to do it. We’re seeing increasing restrictions on where people can work from or what types of databases they can access even within their own company, depending on which geographic location you’re in. There’s more restrictions on where data can be stored, who can access that data, where the servers are going to be installed. And the cross-border transfer of data is now a huge concern for many countries. So the idea of what is work itself, the promise of you can work from anywhere, be a digital nomad, go sit in Bali. I think the technology might allow it, but the geopolitics probably won’t.
ALISON BEARD: We’ve had a lot of episodes on that, and that’s going to make some people sad. And you mentioned the rise of quant analysts. How are new technologies like LLMs helping companies do a better job of sort of estimating their political risks?
SRIVIDYA JANDHYALA: I think what we are seeing with the technology and the LLMs and the data revolution is a different way of thinking about or quantifying these types of risks. So we are going, I think, from deeply contextual knowledge of the process and being embedded in the system to really understand what is going on to a way of thinking about risk, which is much more quantifiable, which is using data from non-traditional sources, looking at, for example, narratives on social media or trying to understand how a company’s operations are being interpreted by different types of audiences, whether that is individuals, customers, policymakers, competitors.
I think it’s these types of innovations that we are seeing with our ability to use either large language models or even other types of data analysis that uses really large data sets and other techniques like machine learning that will help you pass through those really huge volumes of data that we now have access to,. For example, satellite images now is like a big thing in terms of trying to figure out factors such as risk for companies.
ALISON BEARD: Yeah. Yeah. That’s so interesting. It’s like the ability to scrape social media and analyze millions of satellite images to figure out exactly the problems that your company is going to face in a particular geography. Are there any particular companies that you would point to as doing this particularly well? And are there certain geographies or industries that tend to understand how to operate in this new environment better than others?
SRIVIDYA JANDHYALA: Certainly. I think if you think about the traditional industries where geopolitics was always an important factor, those would be defense, mining, oil. These types of companies have had a long history of trying to figure out exactly these types of events. They have had a long history of trying to understand how to navigate these types of changes and they have built the tools and capabilities to do this in most sophisticated ways than other companies that never thought that they were going to be involved in these types of activities, right?
So again, it’s like fast fashion or paint or toys or TV and movies. I think these are the industries where it seems like now we are suddenly slammed with something that we never had the experience for. We never anticipated that we would be in this situation.
I think there’s a couple of companies I think in sectors such as e-commerce that are really in the middle of this and navigating this space. So if you think about companies like Shein, for example, the fast fashion company, so that’s a company I think they have tried to navigate this world and they suddenly found themselves in the middle of geopolitics. I mean, really, they were selling clothed fashion to teenagers. I mean, that’s their demographic.
ALISON BEARD: And this is a China based company.
SRIVIDYA JANDHYALA: So it’s a company that was founded in China, but they never actually sold their products within China. So they were actually shipping it to all around the world. They have been slammed by all kinds of changes, including shipping, including the data collection that they do, which allows them to be very responsive and create new fashions that order of magnitude higher than the traditional fast fashion companies like H&M or Zara. But their ability to collect that data is also exactly why they’re finding themselves in the middle of this type of geopolitical conflict.
And so there’s questions about where do they put their data? What do they do with their servers? Who heads their operations in different countries? And an important part is also where do they put their supply chains? This is a company that became really strong because of their consolidated supply chain in China that allowed them to turn around designs very, very quickly, but they’ve now seen the need. They have invested in supply chains in Brazil, as well as in India and Turkey and a few other places as an effort to try to navigate these geopolitical issues that they’re finding themselves in.
ALISON BEARD: So they’re making the right moves to protect their business for the long term?
SRIVIDYA JANDHYALA: They’re making several moves. Some of them are trying to address some immediate issues, and some of them are really addressing the very core of the issue. What I mean by that is from the way I see it, this is a company that understands that it’s their nationality that is the problem. It’s not that they don’t have good products or services. They are a very, very competitive company, but they understand that the main challenge is because of how others perceive the company’s nationality.
So one of the things that they did, for example, was move their headquarters from China to Singapore and That was a way of moving the diversifying the nationality of the company, if you will. And so now when they’re looking to thinking about their different locations for an IPO, they may have to make that decision again about where they will put their headquarters. So I think that’s an example of a company that I think has really honed in on the main issue that’s driving the challenges that they face.
ALISON BEARD: Great. Well, Srividya, thank you so much. I learned a lot from this conversation and the book.
SRIVIDYA JANDHYALA: Thank you very much for having me. It’s been a pleasure.
ALISON BEARD: That’s Srividya Jandhyala, Associate Professor at ESSEC Business School, and an author of the book, The Great Disruption: How Geopolitics is Changing Companies, Managers, and Work.

93,2025-11-18,"I’m sitting in front of an old Sayno Plasma TV as I write this on my media PC. It’s not a productivity machine, by any means, but the screen has the resolution to do it so I started this document to prove a point. That point? Plasma TVs are awesome.
An Egyptian god might see pixels on an 8K panel, but we puny mortals won’t. Image “Horus Eye 2” by [Jeff Dahl]The full-colour plasma screens that were used as TVs in the 2000s are an awkward technological cul-de-sac. Everyone knows and loves CRTs for the obvious benefits they offer– bright colours, low latency, and scanlines to properly blur pixel art. Modern OLEDs have more resolution than the Eye of Horus, never mind your puny human orbs, and barely sip power compared to their forbearers. Plasma, though? Not old enough to be retro-cool, not new enough to be high-tech, plasma displays are sadly forgotten.
It’s funny, because I firmly believe that without plasma displays, CRTs would have never gone away. Perhaps for that I should hate them, but it’s for the very reasons that Plasma won out over HD-CRTs in the market place that I love them.
I didn’t used to love Plasma TVs. Until a few years ago, I thought of them like you probably do: clunky, heavy, power-hungry, first-gen flatscreens that were properly consigned to the dustbin of history. Then I bought a house.
The house came with a free TV– a big plasma display in the basement. It was left there for two reasons: it was worthless on the open market and it weighed a tonne. I could take it off the wall by myself, but I could feel the ghost of OSHA past frowning at me when I did. Hauling it up the stairs? Yeah, I’d need a buddy for that… and it was 2020. By the time I was organizing the basement, we’d just gone into lockdown, and buddies were hard to come by. So I put it back on the wall, plugged in my laptop, and turned it on.
I was gobsmacked. It looked exactly like a CRT– a giant, totally flat CRT in glorious 1080p. When I stepped to the side, it struck me again: like a CRT, the viewing angle is “yes”.
None of this should have come as a surprise, because I know how a Plasma TV works. I’d just forgotten how good they are. See, a Plasma TV really was an attempt to get all that CRT goodness in a flat screen, and the engineers at Fujitsu, and later elsewhere, really pulled it off.
Like CRTs, you’ve got phosphors excited to produce points of light to create an image– and only when excited, so the blacks are as black as they get. The phosphors are chemically different from those in CRTs but they come in similar colours, so colours on old games and cartoons look right in a way they don’t even on my MacBook’s retina display.
Unlike a CRT, there’s no electron beam scanning the screen, and no shadow mask. Instead, the screen is subdivided into individual pixels inside the flat vacuum panel. The pixels are individually addressed and zapped on and off by an electric current. Unlike a CRT or SED, the voltage here isn’t high enough to generate an electron beam to excite the phosphors; instead the gas discharge inside the display emits enough UV light to do the same job.
Each phosphor-filled pixel glows with its own glorious light thanks to the UV from gas discharge in the cell.Image based on “Plasma-Display-Composition.svg” by [Jari Laamanen].Still, if it feels like a CRT, and that’s because the subpixels are individual blobs of phosphors, excited from behind, and generating their own glorious light.
It’s not a CRT, of course. The biggest difference is that it’s a fixed-pixel display, with all that comes with that. This particular TV has all the ports on the back to make it great for retrogaming, but the NES, or what have you, signal still has to be digitally upscaled to match the resolution. Pixel art goes unblurred by scanlines unless I add it in via emulation, so despite the colour and contrast, it’s not quite the authentic experience.
For some things, like the Atari 2600, the scanline blur really doesn’t matter. Image: “Atari 2600 on my 42 inch plasma TV” by [Jeffisageek] The built-in upscaling doesn’t introduce enough latency for a filthy casual like me to notice, but I’ll never be able to play Duck Hunt on the big screen unless I fake it with a Wii. Apparently some Plasma TVs are awesome for latency on the analog inputs, and others are not much better than an equivalent-era LCD. There’s a reason serious retro gamers pay serious money for big CRTs.
Those big CRTs don’t have to worry about burn in, either, something I have been very careful in the five years I’ve owned this second-hand plasma display to avoid. I can’t remember thinking much about burn-in with CRTs since we retired the amber-phosphor monitor plugged into the Hercules Graphics card on our family’s 286 PC.
The dreaded specter of burn-in is plasma’s Achilles heel – more than the weight and thickness, which were getting much better before LG pulled the plug as the last company to exit this space, or the Energy Star ratings, which weren’t going to catch up to LED-backlit LCDs, but had improved as well. The fear of burn-in made you skip the plasma, especially for console gaming.
This screen is haunted by the ghost of CNN’s old logo. Burning in game graphics was less common but more fun. Ironically, it’s an LCD. Image: “logo of CNN burnt on a screen” by [Nate]Early plasma displays could permanently damage the delicate phosphors in only a handful of hours. That damage burnt the unmoving parts of an image permanently into the phosphors in the form of “ghosting”, and unless you caught it early, it was generally not repairable. The ghosting issue got better over time, but the technology never escaped the stigma, and the problem never entirely went away. If that meant that after a marathon Call-of-Duty session the rest of the family had to stare at your HUD on every movie night, Dad wasn’t going to buy another plasma display.
By the end, the phosphors improved and various tricks like jiggling the image pixel-by-pixel were found to avoid burn-in, and it seems to have worked: there’s absolutely no ghosting on my model, and you can sometimes find late-model Plasma TVs for the low, low cost of “get this thing off my wall and up the stairs” that are equally un-haunted. I may grab another, even if I have to pay for it. It’s a lot easier to hide a spare flatscreen than an extra CRT, another advantage to the plasma TVs, and in no case do phosphors last forever.
Is “grab an old flat screen instead of hunting around for an impossible CRT” a hack? Maybe it’s not, but it’s worth considering, though, because Plasma TVs don’t get the love they deserve. (And seriously, you’re not going to find the mythical 43-inch CRT, even if it technically existed. And you’ll never find a tube that could match the 152” monster Panasonic put out to claim the record back in the day.)
In the mean time, I’m going to enjoy the contrast ratio, refresh rate, and the bonus space heater. I’m in Canada, and winter is coming, so it’s hard to get too overworked about waste heat when there’s frost on your windowpanes.

We gave our 60” Panasonic Plasma TV away to the nail technician.  She loves it.  It was too heavy to mount on the wall when the den was remodeled.  But sure do love the 65” OLED we replaced it with!
I’ll probably love OLED too, once people start giving those away in favour of the next new thing. ;)
No you won’t.
The blues will be washed out by then.
Nature of OLEDs.
I only ever looked at a few plasma TV’s when they first came out.  The window screen effect was awful.  Once I saw it, it was impossible to unsee it.  I never looked at a plasma screen as a serious contender after that. They were expensive and ugly.  Sounds like they fixed it, or maybe I just ruined them for you too since you’ll now look for it, and won’t be able to unsee it.  If they fixed it, this is why first impressions are important.  It would have been better to have never released the window screen version.
It’s all about pixel pitch, I think. If that early plasma you saw was built with 480p natural resolution, then it’s going to have bigger squares than the later ones. As the pixels shrink, the width of the “window screen” spacing between the subpixles pretty much needed to get proportionally smaller. With my HD unit, I don’t see it.
Or maybe it’s just that I grew up with parents always yelling at me to sit well back from the particle accelerator pointed at my face and I’m sat far enough back the window screen effect doesn’t resolve in my vision.
That said, the nature of the technology is that you need a physical barrier betwixt subpixels, so yeah, the window screen effect is going to be there if you look at it up close. It’s there with LCDs, too, if you have the Eyes of Horus or a macro lens.
Fun thing: if your “macro lens” is good enough you can even see the glass microspheres that act as the precision spacers in the liquid crystal material between the two glass/electrode/filter sheets.
I always wondered if it was my cursed excellent eyesight that caused me to see it from a distance.  Same reason I use 4K monitors unscaled, and read it from 4′ away.
I have no idea what resolution I was looking it.  It was “early”.  I was young enough to not have “a lot” of tech experience, old enough to have a job and consider saving for good stuff.  At the time I determined the only pro was space savings, andthe cons were the window screen effect and price.  Price I could have overcome, the space wasn’t a concern for me, but why spend more for a space saving but worse product?  So the plasma’s were always a non consideration for me.  Now I kind of wish I looked at some of the last generation ones to see what I would have thought.

  phosphors excited to produce points of light to create an image– and only when excited

Not quite true.
A plasma display has to “pre-charge” each pixel to keep the ionized path open, which means there’s some leakage going on and the pixels glow very faintly.
It could turn off, but then the response time would be too slow for moving images. Earlier plasma discharge monitors worked in this way, and they actually operated kinda like neon bulbs where striking the arc would keep it going until the current was cut off, so the display kept a “memory” of the picture until it was erased and re-drawn. Plasma TVs strike every pixel on when first powered up, and then modulate the current that is let through by PWM between the minimum and maximum value to change the brightness.
Plasma TVs are also notorious radio noise generators: That great big glorious window to plasma is also a great big glorious window for millions of electrical arcs and long wire electrode antennas radiating broadband hash.
Anybody in your neighbourhood trying to hear shortwave radio will hear your noise instead.  It’s also not hard to find you.  You look to a radio sniffer like a grow operation running kilowatts of lights.
But don’t get me started on residential powerline networking — it’s even worse at producing interference, and much more prevalent.
Aye,  Especially the early models were absolutely horrendeous noise makers. Considering some of them pulled close to a kilowatt while running does give some hints to the noise levels generated.
I thought long and hard when a local company was selling a massive 103″ Panasonic plasma tv a couple years back for pocket change. Essentially just get it out of our store. (TH-103PF10UK)
This thing was incredible; modular inputs on the back, late model top of the line product.
But it was absolutely absurdly excessive in almost every way.
Massive: I had no way to fit it in my condo, and I’m not sure I could even get it into my condo at the time.
     I also did not have enough space to sit far enough back from it, with the calculators saying ~14 foot.
Heavy: it was 500LBS without any stand, and it did not come with a stand.
     It came with eye bolts that screw into the top, to hang it from the roof! No VESA mounting for this thing.
Power: It drew 1550W and only from a 240v outlet… so factor in the cost for an electrician as well.
I still don’t have the space to actually own something like this even now that I am in a house, but it rattles around and comes up every year or so…
U wot m8? Any electric kettle is about 2kW and you don’t need no sparky to plug it in. 😂
Do you also call your proctologist every time you need to wipe?
Note that 240V outlets are not generally available in USA and Canada. They have 120V everywhere and 240V are installed sometimes in basements for heavy machinery.
Some countries are not blessed with 240V outlets in every room.  Check the username.  In Canada 240 V is rarely found at outlets, except for specific appliances like clothes dryer or cookstove.
In Canada, electric kettles are limited to 1250 watts, or 1500 watts for the sketchier ones.
Be thankful you’re not in Japan.  Those 100 V 10 A kettles require more forethought than I’m capable of before I’ve had my first coffee.
But why the heck are UK kettles limited to 2 kW?  There’s 230 V * 13 A = 3 kW available.
The answer is they are not, at least not universally limited to 2kW, if anything that is the baseline minimum you expect in the UK, not sure I’ve seen one that wasn’t 2.4 at least outside of the tiny travel kettle/camping type stuff.
I didn’t see it addressed anywhere, but what absolutely ruined plasma TV’s for me was another trait they shared with CRT displays – flicker.
For whatever reason, I’ve always been very sensitive to flickering lights. Walk into a Best Buy in 2010 and I could tell you from the entryway which TV’s on the wall were plasma and which were LCD. And no, not in a positive way. As much as I wanted the improved contrast and response time over an LCD, I could never have owned one for that reason.
Heck, I even notice on cheaper LCDs that use slow PWM to dim an LED backlight. That’s fortunately becoming much less common, but even at its absolute worst it was never as bad as plasma flicker.
Sensitivity to flicker?  Jeez, you must hate modern headlights even more than I do then.  The flickering of those drives me nuts.  Not sure what frequency it is — 100 Hz or so.
60 Hz (interlaced) CRTs didn’t bug me, probably because they were not bright enough.  When I lived in Africa and Europe though the 50 Hz ones were almost unwatchable.  When the 100 Hz frame-doubled ones came out I was much happier.
They also buzz at high altitude. A friend in CO took me to a TV store, quite the din from them.
My TV is still a 720p Samsung plasma from 2010. I agree that it just looks good, but I mainly keep it around because I see no reason to upgrade it.
It has component so my older consoles can still be hooked up. Since it’s 720p, it’s perfect for the PS3 and Xbox 360, while still displaying 480p well enough so PS2 and Wii look alright!
My 2013 Panasonic VIera TH-P60ST50A 60″ is still my main TV. I really should update it but that would mean finding a way to dispose of it and worse, putting up with all the “smart” junk that comes with modern TVs. The picture is still fine from my seating position, no buzz or burn-in. I’ll probably put the update off for another year. Or two.

97,2025-11-18,"Unless you own a classic car in near-original condition, an antique, or a collectible, it will depreciate as it ages. This is due to the wear and tear that inevitably occurs as time goes by. However, cars like the iconic Jeep Wrangler are generally known to be more resistant to depreciation. But the market changes from time to time, and as of this writing, the Wrangler shows a depreciation rate of around 29% over five years. That's according to an estimate from CarEdge, which cites a selling price of $34,340 when new, meaning a resale value of $24,289 for the five-year-old Wrangler. But you do have to take into account the fact that depreciation calculators aren't perfectly exact, especially with variables like the condition, mileage, and market trends at play.
Hence, we also checked out what KBB projects for Wrangler trims. If you bought a 2020 Wrangler Recon Sport Utility 2D new (at $45,740), the site estimates you'd be left with a resale value of $31,290, and a trade-in value of $29,534 in November 2025. That puts the five-year depreciation rate at around 32%. But this is all purely hypothetical. How much your 2020 Jeep Wrangler depreciates will depend on your specific trim level, its features, condition, mileage, maintenance history, accident history, market conditions, and how popular the model is. If you're curious about your vehicle's current value, you might want to check online listings to see how much Wranglers in similar condition and mileage to yours are going for.
If you consider the data from CarEdge, the Wrangler is doing very well overall. But the residual values on several other popular midsize two-row SUVs have held up just as well. The 2021 Ford Bronco, for one, depreciated by 31% after four years on the road, leaving owners with a resale value of $32,518, down from $46,971 when new, per CarEdge. Meanwhile, KBB data shows a 38% depreciation rate for the 2021 Ford Bronco in the last three years.
The Japanese models seem to fare better at retaining their value after five years. The 2020 Toyota 4Runner, in particular, does really well in this regard, holding onto 75% of its value over five years, according to CarEdge. The 2020 Toyota Land Cruiser is even more impressive, with a CarEdge-estimated five-year depreciation of 18%, which translates into a retained value of around 82%. It's also estimated to have depreciated just 24% in the last three years.
The 2020 Honda Passport's five-year depreciation is pretty steep, but still respectable at 45% (CarEdge). Meanwhile, the depreciation rate within the last three years stands at 29%, according to KBB. The fine performance of these models isn't surprising, given that Japanese car manufacturers have a reputation for making reliable cars that often appeal to the buying public with their dependability and simplicity.
The Jeep Wrangler has been available in a plug-in hybrid 4xe version since 2021. But in this form, it doesn't hold its value as well as traditional gas models. KBB data suggests the 2021 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited 4xe has lost 46% of its value in the last three years, leaving its resale value at $25,032 and trade-in value at $21,426. This depreciation rate is about 1.5 times faster than the average for the gasoline Wrangler Unlimited. 
If you own a 2023 Jeep Wrangler 4xe, data shows it's possibly depreciated 38% in the last two years, something KBB describes as a ""higher loss of value."" Still, Americans are really into the plug-in hybrid Wrangler 4xe – it has been the best-selling plug-in hybrid vehicle in the United States for a while now, with more than 43,000 cars sold in 2022, over 67,000 in 2023, and another 55,554 in 2024.
It's not hard to see the Wrangler 4xe's appeal, but there have also been fears of its Samsung SDI-supplied high-voltage battery short-circuiting and possibly causing a fire. This led to over 154,000 Wrangler 4xe models in the U.S. being recalled. Between this history of battery issues and the heavy discounts meant to incentivize sales of new Wrangler 4xes, it makes sense that its depreciation rate is relatively steep."

Worries over an AI bubble are mounting.
A growing list of experts, from the Bank of England to investor Michael Burry of ‘The Big Short’ fame, have indicated belief in an overvaluation of AI stocks to varying degrees.
Over the past few months, tech executives leading companies with record valuations thanks to the AI hype have also joined their ranks. Sam Altman said in August that he thinks investors are currently “over-excited” about AI. Just last month, Bezos called AI an “industrial bubble.”
The latest name to add to that list is Google CEO Sundar Pichai.
“Given the potential of this technology, the excitement is very rational. It’s also true, when we go through these investment cycles, there are moments we overshoot collectively as an industry,” Pichai told the BBC in an interview published on Tuesday. “So, I think its both rational and there are elements of irrationality in moments like these.”
The Google chief essentially likened the current AI trade to the dot-com bubble, which wiped out around $5 trillion in market value when it burst.
“We can look back at the internet right now, there was clearly a lot of excess investment but none of us would question whether the internet was profound or that it drives a lot of impact, it fundamentally changed how we work digitally as a society,” Pichai said. “I expect AI to be the same.”
What’s been worrying AI enthusiasts more than the spectre of a bubble ballooning is one bursting.
Those worries were raised by some after Meta downsized its AI department last month, following a massive hiring spree over the summer. And then again this past week, when both SoftBank and Peter Thiel’s hedge fund Thiel Macro reportedly dumped their stakes in AI darling Nvidia, which is reporting a much anticipated earnings report on Wednesday afternoon.
When asked what would happen if this hypothetical AI bubble burst, Pichai said that “no company is going to be immune.” That includes Google themselves, even though Pichai said he thinks they are “better positioned.”
Google is one of several companies that have made big bucks on AI hype. Google-parent Alphabet became the fourth company to pass $3 trillion market cap in September. Meanwhile it continues to pour billions into scaling its AI offerings, including the company’s top AI product Gemini.
It’s not just Google that’s shelling out a fortune. Tech giants across the industry are spending exorbitant amounts of money on AI.
Pichai told the BBC that the tech industry overall has “well over a trillion dollars of investment” dedicated to building AI infrastructure, a number that is only exponentially increasing with no end in sight.
Deutsche Bank said in September that current AI spend is so massive that it could be propping up the entire American economy right now.
Meanwhile, an MIT report from August claims that only 5% of businesses that have adopted AI were generating real revenue gains.
Nevertheless, Pichai believes AI is still the future of society.Â In the BBC interview, he had some advice to share on how to navigate this AI-integrated future he and the rest of Silicon Valley are envisioning.
Pichai said that people had to “adapt” as he predicted that widespread adoption of AI will cause certain jobs to “evolve and transition.” To do so, he claimed, everyone in every occupation should embrace using AI in their work. But just moments after this endorsement of AI-integrated work, he admitted that the technology is prone to errors, unlike the company’s other products, like Google Search, which are “more grounded in providing accurate information.”
