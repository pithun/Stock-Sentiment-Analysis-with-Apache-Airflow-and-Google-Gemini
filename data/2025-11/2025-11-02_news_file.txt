The AI boom is far more robust than the dot-com bubble, but there's still a risk it disappoints investors and sends shockwaves through markets and the economy, Liz Ann Sonders says.
Charles Schwab's chief investment strategist told Business Insider that ""extreme enthusiasm"" about innovation and circular deals between tech companies reminded her of the internet bubble 25 years ago.
But she said a key difference is that many dot-com companies were small and loss-making, whereas today's AI leaders are massive companies with strong balance sheets and fast-growing revenues and profits, she said.
For example, Nvidia became the first company to notch a $5 trillion market capitalization this week, but that valuation has some support in the form of the microchip giant's $47 billion revenue and $26 billion net income for the quarter ended July 27.
Sonders said the immense concentration of investor wealth in Big Tech companies means there's ""more exposure to the equity market than ever before."" She said that if a bear market takes hold, it ""could have feeders into the economy"" as consumers might balk at their portfolio losses and cut back on spending, curbing economic growth.
The Wall Street veteran said there's a danger that AI companies fail to deliver on their bullish growth forecasts, which have driven the stock market to record highs.
""That's the ultimate risk — that you've set the expectations bar too high,"" she said. In that situation, even a slight miss could trigger market behavior that's a ""little more egregious,"" she added.
Sonders said that speculation in more niche areas, such as meme stocks, drones, and quantum computing, made her a ""little less uncomfortable"" about investor exuberance, as ""you could have cracks in that armor show up"" without tanking the wider stock market.
She added that gold's surge to record highs of over $4,000 this month was an ""area where the enthusiasm pendulum swung maybe a bit too far,"" and the moves were ""more about FOMO than fundamentally driven.""
Sonders said it's tricky to gauge the health of the US economy right now as the government shutdown has disrupted some data releases: ""We're all flying this plane a little blind right now.""
But she said that economic gauges in recent months have shown rising pressure on lower-income consumers and a softening labor market, which could erode growth.
""It's not screaming 'recession is imminent,'"" Sonders said, but investors should ""be mindful"" of a weakening jobs backdrop.

In front of Randa's Market on 16th Street in the heart of the Mission District, the spot where you would usually find an affectionate cat is now replaced by bouquets of marigolds, candles, and a card that reads, ""Kill a Waymo, save a cat.""
KitKat, a well-fed, nine-year-old tabby cat with emerald eyes, belonged to Mike Zeidan, who owns the liquor store that's sandwiched between a popular bar and the Roxie Theater. KitKat's friendly demeanor made him a popular bodega cat, and he was given the title ""Mayor of 16th Street"" by residents in the neighborhood.
Tragedy struck on Monday. According to an anonymous 311 complaint filed with the city at 12:51 a.m., a Waymo hit KitKat, who was ""sitting in the sidewalk next to the transit lane.""
""The Waymo did not slow down, swerve, or even try to avoid the cat in any way,"" the complaint said. ""Waymos should not be on the street if they can't spot small animals in the dark.""
Waymo confirmed to Business Insider that one of its vehicles encountered a cat at the location.
""We reviewed this, and while our vehicle was stopped to pick up passengers, a nearby cat darted under our vehicle as it was pulling away,"" a Waymo spokesperson told Business Insider in a statement. ""We send our deepest sympathies to the cat's owner and the community who knew and loved him, and we will be making a donation to a local animal rights organization in his honor.""
Zeidan told Business Insider he wasn't the individual who filed the 311 complaint and did not witness the event. He said a couple told him that KitKat had gone under a Waymo and that they attempted to rescue the cat and stop the vehicle. They were unsuccessful.
Zeidan said he was at home sleeping when he was woken up by a call that KitKat had been struck. An employee rushed the feline to an emergency room about a mile away, and Ziedan and his wife soon followed. Not long after the pair arrived, the vet informed them that KitKat had died.
""He really was the special, one-of-a-kind thing that brought everybody together,"" said Zeidan. ""People come a long way just to see him and give him treats and toys — he brought so much love.""
Waymo did not address questions about what a bystander should do if they urgently need to stop a moving autonomous vehicle. Riders can stop the car using the emergency mechanisms in the app or click the ""pull over"" button.
Waymo relies on radar, lidar, and at least 13 external visual cameras to detect objects and movement.
Business Insider's Lloyd Lee described Waymo's 5th-generation autonomous driver as ""a safe but not an annoyingly cautious driver.""
Missy Cummings, director of George Mason University's Autonomy and Robotics Center, told Business Insider that Waymo cars ""do not have a sensor that could detect something underneath the vehicle.""
Cummings said that another company, Cruise, once failed to detect a pedestrian caught under the car and dragged the woman for 20 feet. Cruise is no longer in operation.
Cats that are not kept entirely indoors run the risk of being hit by a car — autonomous or not — in an urban environment.
Throughout the week, KitKat's memorial spot grew from just a few candles to a multitier altar, as residents turned out to grieve the feline and protest Waymo. ""My name is Kitty Cat and I am resting in power,"" read one handwritten sticker on the altar.
Similar sentiments spread online. A Reddit thread detailing KitKat's passing received nearly 2,000 upvotes in a local tech forum, and a post on Randa's Market's Instagram account, which memorializes the cat, received thousands of likes, as well as comments directed at Waymo.
""BY A WAYMO?? This means war,"" one Instagram user commented.
""Lyft and Uber drivers need our business,"" wrote another on Instagram. ""Killing KitKat is another strike against the billionaire techies.""
Bryant Walker Smith, a professor in engineering and law at the University of South Carolina, told Business Insider that the most an owner could do in the event an autonomous vehicle hit their pet is to sue for property damages, but that could be a hurdle in this case, since KitKat mostly roamed freely.
""Law unfortunately treats pets as mere 'chattel' — that is, physical property,"" said Smith. ""The owners are generally entitled only to economic damages such as vet costs and the pet's 'fair market value.'""
""This is sad, because law might consider KitKat, a living creature with inherent value, to have a 'fair market value' of zero,"" Smith added.
Autonomous vehicles have stuck pets before. In 2023, a Waymo vehicle fatally struck a dog in Bernal Heights, and in the same year, a Cruise vehicle hit a Labrador that survived. But the expansion of autonomous vehicles is not slowing down. As of July, Waymo has expanded its operation in the Bay Area to cover more of the San Francisco Peninsula, as well as parts of Palo Alto and Menlo Park in Silicon Valley.
At a recent TechCrunch event, journalist Kirsten Korosec asked Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana if she thinks society would accept a death potentially caused by a robot.
""I think that society will,"" Mawakana responded.

The situation for recipients of supplementary nutrition aid in the United States is not good right now. Due to the government shutdown, November payments to what we call the âfood stampsâ program are not happening. Nothing you can do from your couch, using your smartphone, is about to fix this horror show. But you can actually help out with a band-aid fix by donating at this link.Â Donating to this particular campaign allows specific, qualifying families who are part of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to receive one-time payments of $50 instead of nothing. These are families with kids, and they typically get multiple hundreds of dollars in food benefits monthly.Just know that there are aspects of this that youâre probably not going to like. (Also know that you can donate to, and volunteer at, a food bank in your area as well. They need it right now.)
I was a little unsettled when I noticed just how efficient and seamless this charity campaign can claim to be. An app called Propel and a charity called GiveDirectlyâyes, the one favored by MrBeast and some in the effective altruism communityâcan plausibly funnel money to some of the neediest people in the country, and do so very quickly. In theory, you donate, and your money goes to some of the neediest SNAP recipients in under two days.Â Why it works, however, is another story. Propel is a for-profit fintech company funded by Silicon Valley VCs including Andreessen Horowitz (a firm associated with the MAGA movement). It’s used voluntarily by millions of U.S. benefits recipients because, for one thing, they like it, and also due to other factors, like the fact that the company maintains a heavy footprint in welfare recipients’ discussions on Reddit. Propel appears to be a useful stopgap, patching over some of the clunkiness in the American social safety net. According to Propel, a quarter of SNAP recipients use its app. As such, it has a lot of access and data that a for-profit company might not have in a saner country. So Propel can determine who is neediest by, in its own words, âtargeting Propel users in households of three or more who receive the maximum SNAP allotmentâa key indicator of extremely low or zero earned income.â Itâs coldly logical. They qualify for the largest benefit because the government has determined that theyâre struggling the most. GiveDirectly collects the money, and Propel knows who within its app ecosystem needs it. It then disperses the money via GiveCard (which is yet another startup).Â 
Propel seeded this campaign with $1 million, but it’s not hiding the fact that it’s a private firm hustling to make a name for itself in the fintech world. A âbusiness caseâ exists for this appâmeaning a way for the company to potentially turn a profit, and you can hear Propel co-founder and CEO Jimmy Chen explain it all in this interview on the Andrew Yang Podcast from three months ago.
The Propel app is, Chen says, a âhookâ for people to get pulled in as users, and exposed to the app’s other functions, which sound like much more obvious avenues for the company to make money. For instance, within Propel, Chen says benefits recipients are presented with deals and potential jobs to apply for. So something to keep in mind if youâre donating to this GiveDrectly program (as I am) is that this campaign is a powerful way for Propel to market itself to needy people. After all, if, like the majority of SNAP recipients, you have not downloaded and used the app, youâre not going to get $50.
Gizmodo reached out to Propel for comment, and will update if we hear back.

6,2025-11-02,"Motorola's Edge 70 declares war on the flagship elite.

Motorola has quietly listed its new Edge 70 smartphone on its European websites, and it looks like a direct jab at the ultra-thin phone market dominated by the iPhone Air and Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge. But where its rivals famously compromised, the Edge 70 is showing up with a feature that thin phones almost never have: a massive battery.
The main selling point of the Motorola Edge 70 is its body, which is ridiculously thin at just 5.99mm, and it weighs only 159 grams. The frame is aircraft-grade aluminum, the front is Gorilla Glass 7i, and the back has a unique nylon-textured finish.
It also packs both an IP69 rating for water and dust resistance and MIL-STD 810H durability. It’s available in three Pantone-certified colors: Lilly Pad, Gadget Grey, and Bronze Green.
 



Inside the super-slim chassis, Motorola stuffed a 4,800mAh silicon-carbon battery. That’s a huge capacity for any phone, let alone one this thin. It also supports 68W wired charging and 15W wireless.
However, this isn't a flagship-spec monster. It’s a strategic mid-range play, running on the new Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 chipset, paired with 12GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 512GB of storage. The display is a 6.67-inch pOLED panel with a 2712 x 1220 resolution, a 120Hz refresh rate, and 4,500 nits of peak brightness.
Camera-wise, you get a 50MP main camera with optical stabilization, a 50MP ultrawide with macro capabilities, and a 50MP selfie camera. It ships with Android 16 alongside a promise of four major OS updates and six years of security patches.
The global version of what was the China-only X70 Air, the Edge 70 is priced at €799/£699 (via GSMArena).
Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android
Motorola is taking a big risk with this launch. The ultra-thin phone market is facing challenges, and a Nikkei Asia report says iPhone Air sales are weak because customers want phones that last longer. Motorola is betting it has found the sweet spot: a phone that’s thin enough to feel futuristic but thick enough to house a battery that actually works.

7,2025-11-02,"Nato ""will stand with Ukraine up to the day in which we will have them sitting around the table for a long-lasting peace"", a senior official from the military alliance has told the BBC.
Admiral Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, chair of Nato's military committee since January, added from an operational point of view he considered the Russia-Ukraine war was bogged down, and ""it was almost time to sit and talk because it's a waste of lives"".
Pointing to the fact that Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 had resulted in two more countries joining the Western alliance - Finland and Sweden - Adm Dragone described the war as a strategic failure for Russian President Vladimir Putin, despite recent slow, incremental advances by Russia on the battlefield. 
""They will not get a friendly or puppet government like in Belarus. Putin will not succeed.""
Asked if European nations were prepared to keep going with supporting Ukraine's defence, he said they were. It was beneficial, he believed that they had had something of a wake-up call and were now taking charge of their own defence.
In June, Nato members agreed to raise their defence spending to 5% of GDP by 2035. The move followed repeated urges from US President Donald Trump for members to do so.
On Russia's recent announcement about long-range, nuclear-powered weapons like the Burevestnik and the Poseidon, the former Italian chief of defence staff and naval aviator played down concerns by Nato, saying that it was a defensive nuclear alliance. 
""We are not threatened by them,"" he said, ""we are just ready to defend our 32 nations and our one billion people. We are a nuclear alliance.""
On the risk of future invasions or attacks, Adm Dragone said if - and he emphasised the conditional here - there was to be anywhere it would likely be the Baltic states: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. 
But he pointed out that as Nato states Article 5 would be requested - which considers an attack on one nation to be equivalent to an attack on all - and that Nato would come to their defence. 
Asked if that included the US, he replied: ""Yes, because they have committed to this and they have underlined that they are still in the business.""
Of all Nato defence needs right now, Adm Dragone said air defence was the top priority. Recent incursions by Russian drones into Poland and Romania have prompted the alliance to upgrade its air defences. 
Regarding the possibility of activating a notional ""drone wall"" on Nato's eastern borders, he said this would be done within months and that ""the alliance's Allied Command Transformation in Norfolk [Virginia] is already working on that"".
""There is a lot of stuff on the market which will fulfil our immediate needs so we set up a new activity which is Eastern Sentry... integrating all the air defence that we already have on our eastern flank. 
""Airspace incursions are pretty frequent, we escort them out and that's basically the game,"" the admiral said.
Despite no sign that Russia is changing course on the war in Ukraine and despite signs that some members - notably Slovakia and Hungary - are increasingly opposed to supporting Ukraine's defence, Adm Dragone ended on a positive note. 
""The alliance is reliable, it is mature, there is a cohesion which is our centre of gravity.""
""The alliance is stronger than our adversaries, and we will stay with Ukraine up to the day that peace will break out,"" he added.

8,2025-11-02,"Andrew Mountbatten Windsor arranged a private tour of Buckingham Palace while the late Queen was in residence, for businessmen from a cryptocurrency mining firm which agreed to pay his ex-wife up to £1.4m, the BBC can reveal.
Jay Bloom and his colleague Michael Evers were driven through the palace gates in the former prince's own car after being collected from their five-star Knightsbridge hotel for the visit in June 2019.
Their company, Pegasus Group Holdings, which Mr Bloom co-founded, employed Sarah Ferguson as a ""brand ambassador"" for a crypto-mining scheme which would lose investors millions when it failed less than a year later.
Mr Bloom, an entrepreneur who had previously set up a failed Mafia-themed museum in Las Vegas, and Mr Evers, a former actor, were met by a greeter and escorted inside the palace.
Mr Evers told the BBC they then met the Queen, although Mr Bloom disputed this.
Both Mr Evers and Mr Bloom were invited by the then-prince to his Pitch@Palace event - a Dragons' Den-style business pitching competition - at nearby St James's Palace later that day, and they dined that evening with Andrew, Ms Ferguson and their daughter Princess Beatrice.
Ms Ferguson was working with Pegasus Group Holdings at the time of the palace visit, while she was Duchess of York, to promote plans to use thousands of solar power generators to mine Bitcoin at a remote site in the Arizona desert.
But the project ultimately failed with only 615 of the planned 16,000 generators acquired and just $33,779 (about £25,000) in cryptocurrency mined.
In April 2021, some investors took legal action, claiming millions of dollars of investor funds were unaccounted for. A tribunal awarded the investors $4.1m, but Mr Bloom is seeking permission to appeal.
The revelations add to growing questions about how Andrew and his former wife have funded their lifestyle, as well as long-standing concerns about their business connections and that the then-prince may have used his royal titles and connections for private gain.
On Thursday evening, Buckingham Palace announced that it was starting the formal process of stripping Andrew of his royal titles and that he would be losing his Windsor mansion, following intense criticism of his links with the billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.
Andrew and Ms Ferguson did not respond to a detailed list of questions about their involvement with Mr Bloom and the crypto-mining venture.
Sarah Ferguson was paid more than £200,000 for her work for the company and a leaked contract reveals she was in line for a separate bonus worth £1.2m.
She also received a stake in the business, which proposed using solar generators to reduce the cost of the energy-intensive computer calculations needed to generate or ""mine"" the digital currency Bitcoin.
Her contract stipulated that she required first-class travel, five-star hotels and the services of a professional hairdresser and make-up artist for the maximum of four ""networking events"" she would attend on the company's behalf.
It said she did not ""hold herself out as an expert on the solar industry"" and therefore accepted no responsibility for ""industry-related information or commercial assessments"" used as the basis for her statements promoting the company.
Sarah Ferguson first met the Las Vegas businessman Jay Bloom in May 2018 when she was at a convention in the city to promote one of her children's books.
The pair struck up a friendship and business relationship.
Pegasus documents would subsequently describe her role as to ""engage with the company's clients, investors and strategic relationships"" as well as involvement with the company's planned ""philanthropic activities"".
For Mr Bloom, it was an introduction to royal circles which would lead to visits to Buckingham Palace and St James's Palace, a tour of Ms Ferguson and Andrew's home, the Royal Lodge in Windsor, and dinners with her and her family in at least four different countries.
Eight years before the duchess signed up to be a brand ambassador for Pegasus, Mr Bloom had hit the Las Vegas headlines, accused of missing payments and deceiving investors in connection with a ""mob experience"" exhibition in the city. Mr Bloom denied wrongdoing, fought investors' lawsuits and vowed to repay them.
He now had a new company, Pegasus, and ambitions to build a hotel and casino in Greece.
It was there in July 2018, while considering investing in the company, that Michael Evers, a former actor and reality TV star who had made money from cryptocurrency investments, first met Ms Ferguson.
The hotel and casino did not get built, but Mr Bloom had soon pivoted Pegasus to a new idea, one that was inspired by seeing a mobile solar power generator in use at the Las Vegas motor speedway in early 2019, according to filings in the later legal action brought by investors.
Mr Bloom and his co-founders hit upon a plan to use vast banks of these units to power a crypto-mining operation. The endeavour, the company estimated, would generate millions of dollars a month.
In March 2019, Ms Ferguson had dinner with Mr Bloom in Los Angeles. They had lunch at the Beverly Hills Hotel a few days later as she helped him try to close a deal for Pegasus. One of her daughters stopped by during the meal.
Mr Evers was now working for Pegasus as well as being an investor. He said he and Mr Bloom were regularly in London over the following months as they explored taking Pegasus public on the AIM market - part of the London Stock Exchange for growing companies.
He said he got to know Ms Ferguson and her family and ""through all that, I met Prince Andrew [and] Princess Beatrice and a lot of their family"" who he described as ""really great people, really friendly"".
""We were there once a month for a week to two weeks at a time and every time the relationships just kind of grew stronger and stronger and they started offering tours of different places, I guess like behind the scenes or I don't know what you'd call it,"" Mr Evers said. ""And just wanting to introduce us to more and more people.""
As well as a tour of the Royal Lodge, Andrew and his ex-wife arranged for the pair to visit Buckingham Palace on a day in June 2019 when it was closed to the public.
They were picked up from their Knightsbridge hotel by an official driver in a dark blue Range Rover used by Andrew and driven through the palace gates in the early afternoon.
Once inside they were taken through to the inner courtyard, where a female greeter was waiting to meet them. A video taken by the men from inside the car captured their arrival.
A former Royal Household employee, who reviewed the footage, told BBC News that it was clear that palace security staff on the gate were expecting the vehicle.
""The ramp was dropped before they came out to speak to the driver,"" they said. ""That was the reception we'd expect if we were carrying a member of the Royal Family.""
What happened once they went inside is disputed by the two men.
Mr Evers said they had been told in advance that there would be an opportunity to meet the Queen. But once there, he said staff told him he was not allowed to take photos.
""They didn't want anyone knowing that we were meeting Elizabeth. And it was very, very brief, she was not doing super well, so it was more just like a hello and in passing. No touching or anything,"" he said.
He said it wasn't a formal meeting, ""it was just like a quick, 'hello, goodbye'"".
The Queen was in residence that day, with her published schedule including her regular weekly audience with the prime minister. The Palace was unable to confirm or deny whether the introduction with the two men took place.
Responding to questions by email, Mr Bloom initially said he had decided just to visit the palace as a tourist. He subsequently said the only person he met at the palace was a ""staffer"".
When challenged and presented with evidence from his own social media, which included footage of him being driven into the palace, and comments about spending time with Andrew, and there being ""pictures I can post, the pictures I can't, and then the stuff I couldn't take pictures of... lol"", Mr Bloom said he had misremembered.
He then admitted that he ""was in fact shown to Andrews [sic] office and did thank him for the car and for him and Sarah arranging the tour"".
He denied ever having met or been in the same room as the late Queen.
Mr Bloom made a second visit to Buckingham Palace in July 2019, photos show. On social media he made an apparently joking reference to ""meeting HRH"".
Two months later, Ms Ferguson was one of two celebrity guests - alongside the motivational speaker Tony Robbins, who says he has coached figures such as Serena Williams and Hugh Jackman - at a ""ground breaking"" for Pegasus's energy project launch in the Arizona desert.
They were flown in, with Mr Bloom, Mr Evers and others, in two black-and-gold helicopters and posed with gold-coloured spades and construction hats at the remote site of what Pegasus promised would become a multi-billion-dollar off-grid data centre.
With armed guards with AR-15 rifles and pistols standing nearby, Mr Bloom introduced Ms Ferguson at a press conference as a ""personal friend"".
In the short speech that followed, Ms Ferguson praised the company, saying she was ""so proud to be here"" and touted the potential philanthropic uses of the technology in Africa.
That October, a month before Andrew's fateful BBC Newsnight interview where he disastrously attempted to explain his connections to Mr Epstein, Ms Ferguson signed a contract agreeing to provide specific services for Pegasus.
For reasons that remain unexplained, the contract itself was with Alphabet Capital, a British company whose owner, Adrian Gleave, ran a number of caravan and holiday parks.
A High Court ruling in London in 2024 has previously revealed that Ms Ferguson received more than £200,000 for her work for Pegasus from Alphabet Capital.
Andrew has also received money from Alphabet, including £60,500 traced to Mr Gleave and his businesses, according to court documents previously reported by the BBC.
Neither Andrew nor Mr Gleave have explained why this money was paid.
Mr Bloom said he has never heard of Alphabet or Mr Gleave and there was no connection with Pegasus.
A year after investing millions of dollars in the crypto solar scheme, some of its main investors became concerned about progress and began legal proceedings.
In 2023, judges from the Commercial Arbitration Tribunal in the US found in the investors' favour awarding them millions of dollars.
Jay Bloom has since mounted a number of legal challenges over the award in the Nevada courts.
Mr Bloom told BBC News that Pegasus emphatically disputed ""any allegations of misconduct"" and said they were ""addressing the clearly flawed arbitral findings through established legal processes"".
Andrew and Ms Ferguson did not respond to the BBC's questions, including whether Ms Ferguson planned to repay money received for her Pegasus work to the company's investors.
Mr Evers said he regretted being involved with Pegasus. He said Mr Bloom was ""working very, very hard to get all the investors paid back"" but that he was frustrated to still be owed money himself several years later.
The scandal engulfing Andrew is of his own making but has had a profound impact on his immediate family.
There are also no plans to formally remove Andrew from the line of succession, the government says.
The language of Buckingham Palace's statement is ""very brutal"", royal historian Kelly Swaby tells the BBC.
The sprawling Norfolk estate is home to several properties - here is a look at where Andrew might be moving in.
Some people in Carrickfergus suggest exchanging Prince Andrew Way for the name of another royal.

Flying economy from New York to London is one thing. Flying the same route on a private jet is another — and it's what the rich and famous are paying tens of thousands of dollars to do.
Leading this luxury market is the Georgia-based private jet manufacturer Gulfstream and its ultra-luxe G700. Its cabin is larger than many New York City apartments.
Billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos bought a G700, while Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem reportedly spent $172 million on two for government use.
The 1% can also access the luxury via the private aviation company Flexjet. It added the first of 12 planned G700s to its fractional fleet in September. Flexjet said each plane cost $96 million.
Fractional ownership is like a timeshare for airplanes. Clients purchase hours on a fleet of jets, and Flexjet handles crew and fleet management. Customers pay only for the hours they fly.
A Flexjet spokesperson said fractional hourly costs range from $6,500 to $20,000, with the G700 at the high end. For context, one hour on its most expensive jet costs roughly eight times the average American's monthly mortgage payment of about $2,300 in 2025.
The pandemic accelerated fractional ownership. Aviation Week data shows a 70% increase from June to August compared to 2019. Flexjet CEO Michael Silvestro said wealthy travelers sought cleaner, simpler travel and more privacy amid jet trackers.
Younger clients — mostly Gen Z and millennials aged 18 to 43 — are also entering the market, gaining wealth through self-made and inherited means. Data from the wealth intelligence company Altrata show this group makes up 8% of the world's ultra-high-net-worth population and is projected to reach 35% by 2040.
With these clients largely insulated from economic downturns, the global fractional ownership market was about $8 billion last year and is expected to balloon to nearly $16 billion by 2033.
Ultrarich people worth more than $30 million — now about 511,000 globally and set to grow 31% by 2030 — spent nearly $30 billion on private jets and yachts last year alone. See inside one of those ultimate luxuries.
With about 465 square feet of cabin space, the G700 has up to five living areas and is around the same size as a studio apartment in New York City.
It's larger than the city's microapartments, which average just 300 square feet.
The list price is $78 million, but a Flexjet spokesperson said the company's G700 had add-ons that raised the price to $96 million.
A bedroom with a full-sized bed and a private bathroom sits at the back of the aircraft.
Flexjet said that despite the aft-placed engines, the room is very quiet.
The G700 aft restroom features a white countertop adorned with flowers and hand towels, and the toilet is hidden under a thick seat to minimize the eyesore in the space. There is no shower.
A second bathroom is located in the galley area and is just as nice. They're far from the tight (and often messy) lavatories on most commercial airlines.
A forward zone is set up like an office space with large swivel loungers and tables. Power ports and cupholders are readily available.
The jet also has high-speed Starlink WiFi.
The dining room can host up to six people thanks to a convertible table that stretches across the cabin. Standard catering is included in the hourly price.
Clients can request specific meals be catered onto the jet — and it could be practically anything, from Michelin-starred cuisine to McDonald's.
Forget the headrest touch screen — Flexjet's G700 features a mini movie theater located just before the bedroom.
Here, there is a convertible couch, complete with seat belts, and a television.
Flexjet is known for its grandiose cabin designs, such as the two Gulfstream G650s inspired by Bentley and the Isle of Capri.
Flexjet plans to glamorize the interior of its new G700s over time, and they will feature the standard bells and whistles in the meantime.
As part of the program, Flexjet's G700 includes a specially trained cabin crew member who attends to the ultrarich clients by preparing food, serving drinks, and prepping the living spaces.
They have tools in the jet's kitchen to warm up meals, plus storage and counter space.
The bedroom can accommodate three people between the full bed and the convertible lounger.
There are three other sets of loungers throughout the jet that convert into single beds. A pair of side-by-side loungers turns into a double. The divan in the movie room is another sleep option for one person.
The space, complete with a bed, is located at the front of the plane behind the cockpit and can be closed off from the main living areas.
Its maximum speed is Mach 0.935 (about 717 mph), and it can cruise at Mach 0.90 (about 690 mph).
The plane can connect faraway places like New York and Cape Town, South Africa, and Miami and Dubai nonstop.
The longer the flight, the higher the cost. A 12-hour flight at $20,000 per hour would be roughly $240,000, before any additional costs such as a fuel surcharge.
Qatar Executive, the private arm of Qatar Airways, operates the G700 on a charter basis, meaning clients don't participate in a shared plan and instead pay on demand.
The one-way price between New York and Doha can cost a whopping $300,000.

11,2025-11-02,"“I don’t care how tall he is, but I am worried that this is an indication that he will lie about other things too,” the woman explained

 A woman is struggling to trust a man who lied to her about being 6 feet tall before they met in person.

 When searching for a man online, the woman said that she hadn’t set filters to specify the height of her dates. She explained in a post on Mumsnet that she was, however, expecting her date to be 6 feet because he wrote it on his profile.

 The woman said her ex-husband, family members and several male friends are that height, so she immediately knew the man was lying when she met him in person. She doesn’t believe that he’s any taller than 5 feet 10 inches ""on a good day.""

 “I asked him about it and he said, ‘I’m 5ft 11’ seemed silly to worry about an inch,' ” the woman recalled. “I don’t care how tall he is, but I am worried that this is an indication that he will lie about other things too.”

Getty
 The woman said that when scrolling dating apps, she’s always mindful not to match with men who claim to be a different age in their bio than on their profile listing, as it seems to be their way of getting around age filters. 

 Curious how other people would react to lies about height, she asked, “Anyone dated someone who lied about this online, and they turned out to be an honest, okay guy?”

 Responses to the post were divided as several people agreed that lies about height are a red flag, while others claimed it wouldn’t be a dealbreaker for them.

 “I don’t think it’s a big deal,” one person wrote.“I think a LOT of men lie about their height when they are under 6 foot. My partner, as far as I’m aware, is not a big liar or a red flag (but I guess you never know!) and he definitely adds a couple of inches onto his height when I know he’s not that tall. I think it’s just insecurity. Silly lie, though.”

 Another commented, “Complete non-issue. How many women would round down their weight if they had to declare it? I know I would.”

 “I met my partner online,” a third chimed in. “He had to put a height range, and he chose 6ft (he swears to god he didn't). It turns out he is about 5ft 8. I couldn't give a monkey's, but I rib him about it occasionally. I go for what's inside, not the physical.”

 “Don’t be gaslit, OP [original poster]. He lied. Clearly, his charming personality didn’t make you overlook that. I wouldn’t see him again,” someone else said. 

 “An extra inch can make a lot of difference.. Throw him back OP. He has probably lied about other areas of his profile,” another person added.

The global AI market could reach $4.8 trillion by 2033, meaning companies like OpenAI and Microsoft stand to rake in hefty profits.
Some people are already cashing in on the increasingly ubiquitous tech, including 17-year-old Samik Sidhu of Virginia. While running two businesses — an Etsy apparel shop and a for-profit networking community — in 2024, he began investing the profits from those ventures in stocks of tech companies.
""Rather than having my money sit in an account, it was able to work for me,"" Sidhu said.
Sidhu earned $37,400 by selling graphic T-shirts and other items through his Etsy shop, while the networking community amassed around $28,000. After investing around $53,100 across four companies — Nvidia, AMD, C3.ai, and SMCI — between February and May 2024, Sidhu managed to earn about $72,700. Business Insider verified the related documents.
Sidhu told Business Insider that he had a ""good feeling"" about investing in companies that were involved in the AI industry.
""I caught the AI wave at the perfect time,"" Sidhu said.
Although Sidhu said he wasn't ""super big"" into AI, incorporating the technology into his former e-commerce business operations helped boost efficiency.
""AI helped me with branding, naming my stores, logos, color themes, niches, demographics, all that stuff,"" Sidhu said. ""I had confidence that over time it would only get better and better. I have literally seen the progression of AI since 2020.""
Demand for AI technology has increased over the years, but it received a significant boost during the COVID-19 pandemic, when businesses sought to streamline operations amid shrinking budgets and remote workforces. The general public became more familiar with AI through OpenAI's ChatGPT, a chatbot powered by a large language model. Since then, Big Tech companies like Microsoft, Apple, and Google have been racing to lead the industry.
Sidhu said he has since expanded his portfolio to include companies featured in the S&P 500, such as Apple, Microsoft, and Google.
Sidhu told Business Insider that seeing other young folks find success through e-commerce businesses sparked his entrepreneurial spirit. Since 2022, he said he has pursued various ventures, including dropshipping, flipping clothes, social media theme pages, and a print-on-demand service.
Obstacles, such as low sales or high fulfillment costs, prompted him to shutter those businesses, forcing him to reassess his approach.
""I went from business model to business model and had doubts like, 'Oh, am I just too optimistic?' But then again, I told myself I'll get learning experience out of it,"" Sidhu said. ""I might not make money right now, but with the skills that I'm building up over my first few business ventures, one day I guarantee they'll come in use.""
That turned out to be true in early 2024, when he set his sights on Etsy. Unlike social media, where algorithms can be tricky to read and attracting customers may feel unpredictable, Sidhu believed Etsy held promise.
""I saw it as a platform with built-in traffic and potential organic traffic, so I started uploading listings slowly,"" he said.
Sidhu launched his apparel shop in January, but closed it down in May.
""Most of my customers were happy, but the occasional customer would not receive their order or experience delayed shipping,"" he said. ""I didn't really want to deal with that.""
Around that same time, in March 2024, Sidhu decided to try digital products. He said he used Signal, the encrypted messaging app, to create a networking community.
""I built a private paid Signal community where I taught teens and young adults how to get started with e-commerce,"" Sidhu said. ""The main focus of the community was print on demand, and how to research niches, set up stores, learn from competitors, design, and fulfill products on platforms like Shopify.""
For example, people could purchase an e-book with advice and tips for $50, or enlist Sidhu's help in developing their company's branding for $150. Sales for his digital products peaked in April before slowing down in May, prompting him to close the group soon after.
Being a young entrepreneur comes with its own set of challenges, such as juggling school and business or not being old enough to access certain accounts. Sidhu said the key to success is finding stability within those challenges.
""The biggest tip I would say is to pick one thing and stay consistent with it. Stay dedicated, stay disciplined, and have a schedule for it,"" Sidhu said. ""If you're diving into a new business venture, know exactly what you need to get done. Know your timelines. Be strict with yourself about those timelines.""
Being persistent is also key.
""You're going to have to adapt to a lot of different challenges that come up, and there's always competition out there,"" Sidhu said.""There's always someone who has 10 times the amount of experience you do, who's double your age, and has been doing it for most of their life. You need to stay consistent. Otherwise, you don't stand a chance.""

13,2025-11-02,"Robert Medhurst spent most of his freshers' week looking at social media, reading posts about other students' fun nights out. 
""I was just in bed,"" Robert recalls, describing the week as the loneliest time of his life.
Robert's flatmates didn't go out much, and his course didn't feel very sociable.
Despite putting himself out there by going to taster sessions for various societies, he couldn't find his people.
""I started to lose my confidence,"" he says. ""I felt like people didn't want to be friends with me, or they didn't like me.""
Initially, Robert had no intention of going to university and had a job offer for after sixth form. But then he saw his friends living it up as students on Instagram and Snapchat.
""When you've got to get up for work on Thursday at 9:00 and you see someone's been out on Wednesday night, you do start thinking the grass is greener,"" Robert says.
Sick of the FOMO, and wanting to keep his career options open, Robert decided to apply to Nottingham Trent to study business. He chose the university because of its reputation for student life: ""I did so much research to make sure I was confident in my choice.""
But in a matter of days, Robert was considering dropping out.
""Social media makes it worse,"" he says of those early months of his first year, explaining that other people's posts about student life can make it feel like ""everyone's getting along, but I'm not"".
In a TikTok video, Robert posted about feeling lonely during freshers' week. The comments section was flooded with other students sharing similar experiences.
TV shows and social media can glorify the idea of student life. Lots of people come to university with high expectations for what they think could be the best years of their lives: living with their friends, going on nights out, studying a subject they love, and getting stuck in with a new sport or hobby.
But for some, the experience isn't what they expect.
Some students come to university with ""rose-tinted glasses"", says Lauren Howard, who manages counselling services at the University of Bradford.
In a poll of freshers in their first week at Swansea University, students' biggest concern was fitting in and feeling included, says Joanne Parfitt, the university's associate director of transition and progression.
And in a survey by market research agency Cibyl, 17% of students said they had no friends at university and 37% said they worried daily or weekly about making friends.
""[New students] find it quite daunting because if you've left school or sixth form, you have your friendship groups that you have to leave,"" Ms Parfitt says. ""For some, it's an opportunity to start again and create a new identity. But for many, it's really daunting.""
Alisha Miah's TikTok feed was full of videos of girls having fun while living together in student houses - having movie nights and picnics, going on trips together.
But when Alisha moved from London to Sheffield in September 2024 to study journalism, she found freshers' week ""overwhelming"" because of how much alcohol it involved.
Alisha doesn't drink and had never been clubbing before.
""I did spend a lot of freshers' week in my room,"" she says. ""I just felt a bit alienated.""
This continued over Alisha's first few months at university. ""I felt anxious when socialising,"" she says. ""I also feel I didn't put myself out there enough.""
Like Robert, Alisha considered dropping out or switching courses, but decided not to because she felt she was at university to study, not to make friends.
In a 2025 survey of more than 10,000 undergraduate students by the Higher Education Policy Institute (HEPI) and the charity Advance HE, 29% said they had considered dropping out. 
The most common reason, was their mental and emotional health, followed by financial concerns.
As new students navigate trying to make friends, living away from family and potentially budgeting for the first time, ""it's difficult to imagine a more challenging time"", says Mrs Howard, from the University of Bradford.
""Anxiety about all of these different things is massively common, and normal.""
Though Christina Aaliyah Davis enjoyed her time studying medicine at Newcastle University, she says it wasn't the ""utopia of friendship"" her family told her it would be.
""It was almost like there was this pressure to see university as this magical, friendly place where everyone is singing and dancing together,"" the 24-year-old doctor says.
When she was in sixth form, she dreamed of having dinners with her university flatmates and hosting Halloween parties. But Christina wasn't very close to her first-year flatmates and sometimes felt lonely.
""I felt like I missed out a little bit,"" she says.
With time, Robert, Alisha and Christina all found their feet and developed friendships.
Alisha made friends through her course and through TikTok, while Christina felt happier once she was able to move in with friends after her first year.
For Robert, now 24 and in his final year, it was joining his university's drama society and getting a part-time job at a bar that helped him make friends. He also enjoyed volunteering at freshers' week in his second and third years, helping new students settle in.
Robert's advice to first-year students struggling to socialise is to just ""get out of your room"" and go to club and society taster events until you find one you enjoy. And he recommends continuing to turn up, even if it feels a bit awkward at first.
""After a few weeks of consistently showing up, people recognise your face,"" Robert says, ""you recognise theirs, and you start making friends"".
The government body says meningitis symptoms can easily be confused with a hangover. 
Half of the pupils from Welsh-medium schools who started at university this year have left Wales.
City College Birmingham students speak to BBC Politics Midlands about their courses.
The city council is working with the charity Frontline to give graduates intensive practical and academic training over the next three years.
The university apologises for sending letters that identified staff at risk of redundancy.

Elon Musk isn't afraid to commit to the bit.
One day before he officially acquired Twitter for $44 billion in 2022, he shared a video on his account that showed him carrying a sink into the social media platform's former headquarters in San Francisco.
""Entering Twitter HQ — let that sink in!,"" Musk wrote.
Entering Twitter HQ – let that sink in! pic.twitter.com/D68z4K2wq7
During Friday's episode of the ""All-In"" podcast, Musk said that the video, which now has 1.2 million likes and 202,000 reposts, almost didn't happen.
""Well, I think the store was confused because my security team was asking for any kind of sink, and normally, people wouldn't ask for any kind of sink because you need a sink that fits in your bathroom or connects to a certain kind of plumbing,"" Musk said. ""So, they're trying to ask, 'What kind of faucets do you want?' No, I just wanted a sink.""
Musk said the store almost didn't sell them a sink out of concern.
""The store was confused that we just wanted a sink and didn't care what the sink connected to,"" Musk said. ""They were, like, almost not letting us buy the sink because they thought maybe we'd buy the wrong sink.""
""It's just rare that somebody wants a sink for sink's sake,"" Musk said.
Representatives for Musk and X did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.
Twitter, now known as X, underwent major changes after Musk completed his takeover, including layoffs, office closures, and the discontinuation of the original blue checkmark verification feature.
Another significant shift happened this March when Musk announced that his AI company, xAI, acquired X in an all-stock deal.
""xAI and X's futures are intertwined,"" Musk wrote. ""Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent. This combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI's advanced AI capability and expertise with X's massive reach.""
Grok, a generative chatbot that debuted on the social media platform in November 2023, is just one example of how Musk is encouraging synergy.
The chatbot, powered by a large language model with the same name, can answer users' queries on X and in Tesla vehicles. It also has a stand-alone website.
Although Musk has shared plans to expand Grok's capabilities, the system has encountered some challenges. In July, the chatbot faced criticism after it shared several antisemitic posts, prompting xAI to apologize for its ""horrific behavior.""
""After careful investigation, we discovered the root cause was an update to a code path upstream of the @grok bot,"" the company wrote on X.
The incident occurred days before xAI debuted Grok 4, the latest iteration of the chatbot.

                A train is parked at the station after a mass stabbing on a London-bound train in Huntingdon, England, Sunday, Nov. 2, 2025.

LONDON — British police dismissed speculation on Sunday that a mass stabbing attack on a London-bound train the previous evening was terrorism-related and said two people who were wounded remain in a life-threatening condition.
Police also said that two men, born in the United Kingdom, remain in custody at separate police stations. They were arrested eight minutes after the first emergency calls were made at 7:42 p.m. from aboard the train, where passengers had reported scenes of panic and chaos with many running through the carriages and some seeking safety in the toilets.
""This is a shocking incident and my thoughts are with those who have been injured and their families,"" British Transport Police Superintendent John Loveless said outside the station in Huntingdon in eastern England where the train halted soon after the attack.
""There is nothing to suggest this is a terrorist incident,"" he added.
The two arrested remain in custody, he said, adding that one is a 32-year-old Black British man, the other is a 35-year-old man of Caribbean descent. The relationship of the two suspects was not revealed, nor was the type of knife, or knives, used.
Loveless also gave an update on the wounded, reducing the number in life-threatening condition from nine to two. He said four of them were discharged and that one other person arrived at the hospital, taking the overall number treated to 11.
After its emergency stop in Huntingdon, a market town around 120 kilometers (75 miles) north of London, bloodied and confused passengers spilled out of the train. Dozens of police waited, some of them armed, and the two suspects were quickly arrested, Loveless said.
During the immediate response to the attack, police said that ""Plato,"" the national code word used by police and emergency services when responding to what could be a ""marauding terror attack,"" was initiated. That declaration was later rescinded but no motive for the attack has been disclosed.
""At this early stage it would not be appropriate to speculate on the causes of the incident,"" Loveless said.
The attack took place as the 6:25 p.m. train from Doncaster in northern England to London's King's Cross station was about halfway through its two-hour journey, having just departed from a stop at Peterborough.
Passenger Olly Foster told the BBC he heard people shouting ""run, run, there's a guy literally stabbing everyone,"" and initially thought it might have been a Halloween prank — Saturday was the day after Halloween. But as passengers pushed past him to get away, he noticed his hand was covered in blood from a chair he had leaned on.
Following reports that some of those on board the train put themselves in harm's way to protect others, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood praised the ""exceptional bravery of staff and passengers on the train.""
King Charles III said he and his wife, Queen Camilla, sent their sympathies and thoughts to those affected and that they were ""truly appalled and shocked to hear of the dreadful knife attack.""
London North Eastern Railway, or LNER, which operates the East Coast Mainline services in the U.K., confirmed the incident had happened on one of its trains and said there would be major disruption on the route until Monday.
British Transport Police's Loveless said passengers will see a ""high visibility presence of police officers at stations and on trains"" on Sunday.

There were plenty of new smartphone launches on the other side of the ocean in the last couple of weeks, but the US market has been pretty quiet. That doesn’t mean there aren’t any discounts this week, of course.
This is probably not a good sign – the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is under $700 for a 256GB unit and the upgrade to 512GB is only $40. Never mind the S25+ (which is out of stock on Amazon, anyway), the S25 Edge is now cheaper than the vanilla Galaxy S25! Unless you settle for the 128GB S25, which you probably shouldn’t.
Despite their different sizes – 6.7” screen on the Edge and 6.2” on the vanilla phone – they weigh basically the same at 163g. Unfortunately, their batteries are pretty similar too, 3,900mAh/4,000mAh. On the plus side, the Edge gets you a 200MP main camera, something that was previously reserved for the Ultra.
Speaking of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, its price has been pretty stable at around $1,000 – under if you can live with 256GB storage, over if you need 512GB. Here’s how the S25 Ultra and S25 Edge compare.
While the vanilla S25 has its petite size as an advantage, the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE is taller and wider than the S25 Edge – thicker (7.4mm vs. 5.8mm) and heavier too (190g vs. 163g), of course. So, the FE price probably has to drop even lower since there’s only $40 separating the 256GB models. The FE is a solid mid-ranger, but its 1080p+ display and year-old Exynos 2400 chipset don’t compare well with the 1440p+ display and Snapdragon 8 Elite of the premium Edge.
The OnePlus 15 launched in China and it is surely headed for a global release, but when it might be available in the US is anyone’s guess. Meanwhile, the OnePlus 13 is having a last hurrah with a solid discount, especially on the 512GB unit.
There’s no 15R yet, not officially, anyway (OnePlus did unveil the Ace 6). So, the OnePlus 13R costing $533 for a 256GB unit looks like a better deal than the S25 FE. It uses a year-old chipset too, but it’s the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. And the 6.78” display has a higher 1264p+ resolution (both are LTPO). The telephoto camera wins on resolution (50MP vs. 8MP) but has a shorter focal length (2x/47mm vs. 3x/75mm). On the plus side, you get a larger battery (6,000mAh vs. 4,900mAh) and fast wired charging (80W vs. 45W), even if you lose wireless charging (15W on the FE).
Apple recently unveiled new iPad Pros with the latest M5 chipset – those became available last week and are already sporting a $50 discount. It’s not much, but it’s more than new Apple products typically get.
The revamped Apple MacBook Pro 2025 14.2” laptop also brings M5 power and a $50 discount.
If you want an Android tablet, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE and Tab S10 FE+ come in 10.9” and 13.1” sizes with 90Hz IPS LCDs. Now, these are FE tablets so they have mid-range power with an Exynos 1580. Still, they are fast enough for DeX multitasking.
We are currently reviewing the CMF Headphone Pro and early impressions are quite good. These cheap over-ear headphones have solid build quality, good sound and capable noise cancellation. Cheap as they are, $100 normally, they are even cheaper now with a $16 discount.
You can also have a look at the Nothing Headphone (1) – those cost $300 (no discount at the moment), so there’s a vast chasm between them and the CMF. They sure are stylish, even if their style isn’t for everyone, and are quite capable. Still, at over 3x the price, they are a tough sell over the CMF Headphone Pro.
We may get a commission from qualifying sales.
Less than six months after launch, yet lost half its price. Finally, consumers realised that the S25 Edge is nothing more than just a certain fruit brand-following gimmick. Juan Carlos Bagnell, aka SomeGadgetGuy, has always been right all along*.

i hope 12/512 vanilla s25 will goes down more

Updated on:  November 2, 2025 / 2:40 PM EST
            / CBS News
          
Americans are increasingly voicing concern about the shutdown's impact on the U.S. economy, as a big majority feel Congress isn't even working to try to end it.
There's also increased worry from people over being personally affected, particularly among those with lower incomes, along with that concern about national impact.
Politically, that means no one is ""winning"" overall: Congressional Democrats, Republicans and President Trump are all drawing increasingly negative marks for their handling of it as it has gone on.  
Democrats express more concern over the economic impact than Republicans do. 
Other governmental functions, including air travel, also draw concern due to the shutdown.
Most disapprove of how all the players involved are handling it, and those views have become a bit more negative over October, the month when the shutdown began.
Looking within the rank-and-file of each party, both congressional Republicans and Democrats draw majority approval from their respective partisans. But the Republican base is even more solidly approving of its delegation than the Democrats are of their own.
Some of that is related to attention: the Democrats who don't approve or are unsure of their party aren't following news of the shutdown as closely. Another may be financial: Rank-and-file Democrats generally express more concern about the shutdown's effects on the economy and on themselves, and the Democrats who do approve are also a little more likely to call their own financial situation good, so they may think of themselves in a better position to weather any impact.
But overall, Congress isn't perceived as even working to end it.
Americans are especially sensitive because the economy continues to elicit uncertainty.
Ratings of it have been bad for years — nothing much has changed there — and expectations for the coming year remain mixed at best. Support for tariffs remains negative as it has been; views of the job market are also negative — and there's also continuing concern, amid all the recent news about AI investment and the market, that AI will take jobs.
But perhaps most of all, prices are still seen as rising — a reminder amid a sea of other measures that it is prices, not the rate of change in inflation, that Americans often perceive most immediately.
Few expect prices to come down in the next few months, either. 
Those who expect continued higher prices and have a more negative outlook on the economy are particularly concerned about the economic effects of the shutdown. 
One year on from his election victory, most Americans do perceive Mr. Trump as trying to fulfil his campaign promises, even though many say it's a different approach than they expected — nor do all approve.
And as we're reminded again this week amid more state elections, politics is about choices, not just evaluations. 
On the policy front, Mr. Trump and the Republicans' perceived approaches to both economic and immigration policy are today favored over the Democrats' in a straight-up comparison. (A sizable number don't seem to like either, or aren't sure.)
For context, ahead of this week's races and as we head into a midterm election year, there's always the political question of how much of a factor Donald Trump will be in other contests, and whether Democrats also need to move this needle on perceived policy approach to be competitive.
One item drawing attention this week is the New York mayor's race (which most people nationally say they're following, if not very closely.) We asked Democrats nationwide what they thought their party's economic policies should be as it regards socialism and capitalism — and most Democrats would see their party have a mix of both, but not more of one exclusively. 
And another topic in focus this week will be redistricting, where Californians will vote on a redistricting measure, while debates over redrawing lines take place across multiple states. 
The American public is not so keen on all that. Most of them think the lines ought to be left alone until 2030, or that more competitive — not more gerrymandered — districts ought to be drawn.
Only a quarter of the public (largely, only the strongest partisans) want more districts one party can win.
Meanwhile all of that economic uncertainty — and mixed approach — does continue to take its toll on Mr. Trump's ratings on inflation and the economy, specifically. Those, along with the shutdown, continue to weigh on his overall approval, and all have been ticking down over time to their lows for this term. Inflation, in particular, sees him with two-thirds disapproving.
Mr. Trump does get relatively better, if not positive, marks on immigration. That's been the case for a while, in part, because his GOP is so solidly behind him on the matter, including his deportation program, and in part because Americans overall do say border crossings are down under his administration.
The negotiated peace deal between Israel and Hamas has given Mr. Trump a bump in his approval on handling that conflict. He gets relatively higher approval from independents (and Democrats to some extent)  on handling the Israel-Hamas conflict than he does overall. 
He gets more positive marks on this than he does overall and on the economy, inflation and immigration, more specifically.
Overall, Mr. Trump's approval has ticked down just a point from early October, and remains in the low 40s where it has generally been since mid-summer. 
This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,124 U.S. adults interviewed between October 29-31, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote. The margin of error is ±2.6 points.

20,2025-11-02,"Amazon might seem as though it is a culprit in the steady decline of office supply stores, but that’s not entirely the case. 
Staples and its rivals Office Depot and Office Max, which are both under the parent company ODP Corporation, took a hit over time because consumer habits and needs changed. 
The e-commerce shift saw shoppers move over to Amazon and Walmart online for office supplies, while less demand saw remote and hybrid work sharply reduce office supply needs. There’s also a foot traffic drop, where in-store visits and small-business purchasing both declined. Not to mention the financial strain, where falling sales led to restructuring and a planned acquisition by Atlas Holdings, among other reasonings, per TheStreet. 
This all led to the ODP brands continuing to shrink their retail operations, which is likely to continue after the company’s sale to Atlas Holdings closes. 
“ODP Corporation being taken private with the Atlas Holdings deal signals a renewed focus on operational efficiency and a leaner cost structure for the office supplies company,” Total Retail reported.
There’s also other benefits. 
“Going private may enable ODP to make long-term investments in the business by freeing it from being so quarterly-earnings focused. These investments, whether in product, supply chain, marketing, real estate, etc., could help strengthen the business going forward,” Total Retail’s Joe Keenan added. 
As it turns out, Office Depot has closed over 1,000 stores since its 2023 merger, reducing its store count by about 55%. 
The latest corporate change should build on the original merger of OfficeMax and Office Depot. 
“The announced deal to merge OfficeMax and Office Depot would, presumably, help the combined company cut costs by eliminating duplicative positions and doing away with underperforming locations while giving it increased purchasing power and marketing clout,” RetailWire’s George Anderson wrote.
According to theodpcorp.com, in Q2 2025, the company reported closing 60 retail stores (Office Depot + Office Max) over the prior 12-month period. 
In 2024, it continued to close stores quietly, as there were reported closures in various locations that includes Placerville, CA; Nampa, ID; San Antonio, TX, per News Observer. 
As of 2024, the company operated roughly 922 retail stores across both brands. 
As of 2025, after closures over 12 months, the store count was around 830 locations, according to CT Insider. 
As a result, the overall market is shrinking. 
“The office supply store industry has faced choppy waters recently, battling shrinking profit and declining demand due to digitalization and intense competition. In 2025, the industry’s revenue will stand at $20.9 billion, reflecting a drop of 1.8% from the previous year. This decline aligns with the industry’s overall five-year CAGR of -4.0%,” IBISWorld reported.

When it comes to retail jobs, most Americans fall into one of two camps: they've either done the job themselves or they know someone who has.
More than 15 million people work in the retail trade sector, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's nearly one-tenth of the US workforce. And a 2022 study from the Urban Institute found that nearly two-thirds of Americans had worked in retail at some point in their careers.
But retail is changing in big ways.
With the Federal minimum wage unchanged since 2009 at $7.25 an hour, many retailers are doubling or tripling it to attract and retain staff.
And Walmart, the largest private employer in the US (and the world), recently shook up the way it pays frontline hourly workers. Instead of simply offering pay increases based solely on years of service with the company, the retail giant is evaluating worker and store performance as well to nudge raises up or down by as much as one percentage point.
Still, hourly wages are one part of the pay equation.
An individual's total earnings also depend greatly on the number of hours they work in a given period, which can vary considerably, especially in more seasonal businesses.
Many of the employers in this list said their median employee was a part time worker who averaged 20 hours or less a week. It's also very common in retail for workers to hold multiple jobs.
To get a picture of what the typical worker makes in a year at various large retail brands (with market capitalization of more than $10 billion), Business Insider used AlphaSense to search the most recent proxy filings that publicly traded companies must file with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
All public companies must calculate their median worker's annual salary to compare it to the CEO's compensation.
In terms of compensation, half of a company's workers earn more and half earn less than its ""median employee.""

No wonder a job at Costco is widely considered to be one of the best in retail.

25,2025-11-02,"Now that Halloween is officially over, we've begun the dreaded march into the real holiday season. That means spending extended periods of time with our hooman family, dry turkey, and pawsitively awkward conversations with our crazy uncle who won't stop talking about the stock market. Needless to say, we'd much rather be at home with our feline family, but we have to show up. We know we're not the only ones who have families that are, let's say, purrfectly difficult to deal with, so we've devised a few ways to survive the holiday season that we want to share with you.
The first is to pretend your sick, but that doesn't work very well, and then you also miss out on all the free food, so we don't really recommend it.
The second is to go, but spend the whole time scrolling through some feisty feline funnies to keep your mood pawsitive while chaos reigns all around you. While the turkey is being carved, gravy is being spilled, and Aunt Diane is screaming while chewing her green beans, you can be blissfully immersed in the hilarious cattos of the internet and oblivious to everything else. This is our prefurred choice because it not only makes us giggle, but it also reminds us of our kitties at home.
If you need help getting through Thanksgiving and Christmas (or any other holidays you may celebrate), we propose these purrfectly hissterical felines in the form of memes below. They might not make your family less insane, but they certainly will help you stay sane in the meantime.
""4 o'clock: Wallow in self-pity5 o'clock: Solve world hunger (tell no one)5:30 : Jazzercise6:30 : Dinner with me (I can't cancel that again!)7 o'clock: Wrestle with my self-loathing….
I'm booked!"" - The Grinch
Once our cats understand how to use smartphones, it's over for hoomanity. Then they'll realize that we do still worship them based on how many cat pictures/memes there are on the internet, which will give them the confidence to finally rise up and seize control of the world.

The closest I ever got to breaking up with my now-wife was our last semester in college. 
We were high-school sweethearts who had maintained a healthy relationship despite being long-distance. She went to The Ohio State University, while I attended Miami University, two hours away.
Before graduation, she had already lined up an engineering job, but it required frequent moves around the country.
I was happy for her, but I was tired of long-distance and wanted to settle down. I also knew that following her to her various job locations would make it hard for me to have my own career. 
However, I loved her, and that was more important.
We decided to get married before her first job-related move, and we had a beautiful wedding with most of our friends and family. 
Though we've both enjoyed sharing each other's company and making lasting memories in new places, I've struggled to find work as we continue to change locations.
My wife's different job locations, known as her rotations, last eight months each. We started in Ohio, then moved to Texas, and will soon be heading to Georgia. 
Eight months isn't much time to establish a career, which made finding a new job difficult.
I started searching for employment in Texas before we moved, but I couldn't even apply to some positions because they required applicants to already be in the state. 
For applications without this requirement, I still wanted to be transparent. I explained my situation in multiple cover letters, but I never heard back from those jobs.
In Ohio, my applications led to an interview for a position at a newspaper. The paper's editors were desperately seeking a candidate and liked me enough to meet for coffee.
During the interview, they told me about how they wanted a reporter who could build relationships with local businesses. When I asked how long they imagined it would take to fit into that kind of role, they said it would be at least half a year. 
They immediately sensed my concern, and I told them I would have to move as soon as I built those connections.
As I struggled to find in-person jobs, I also looked for remote options that I could keep between rotations. Getting a good, fully remote job in this competitive market is not easy, and I struggled to find roles I actually wanted. 
As a writer who's concerned about the future of artificial intelligence, I refused to take any jobs involving AI training. However, the lack of options made it difficult to be picky. 
Many of the positions I found on job boards were for companies focused on the advancement of AI. I even received messages from recruiters on LinkedIn stating that I'd be a good fit for these types of jobs.
These opportunities started to wear me down, and I came dangerously close to caving. Thankfully, my mom and my wife talked me out of it, and I stuck to my morals.
My lack of success applying for jobs led me to the gig economy, allowing me to pick up work on an as-needed basis. 
I had heard nightmare stories from food delivery drivers, photographers, and more about how difficult it can be to navigate the financial instability and uncertainty of this world. 
Thankfully, tagging along with my wife for her job meant she'd be able to support me with her steady income as I entered new territory. 
I started by filling in as a substitute teacher while I learned how to become a freelance writer. I had always imagined I'd work full-time for a local newspaper when I graduated, so it was a big change for me.
I'm glad that I've found ways to make money and continue building my career during this phase of my life. Though I've enjoyed the freedom my freelancing has given me, it makes me a little sad that I don't get to be part of an actual staff. 
However, that sadness quickly goes away when I remember that freelancing has allowed me to follow my wife on her journey.

I just turned 40 years old, and like many at this milestone, I've been reflecting on the lessons I wish I had understood sooner — specifically when it comes to work.
My career has taken me from newsrooms at some of the biggest broadcasters to launching my own business. I've achieved great success along the way, but, of course, it came with some challenges.
Starting out in media as a 20-something, I was naive about some aspects of career development. Twenty years later, as I reflect back on the start of my work life, I now wish I could tell my younger self these five simple truths.
When I was fresh out of university, I thought the job title was everything. My ego wanted a fast climb. But my real education didn't come from my job title; it came from being in the right rooms.
My early years as a TV news publicist were not flashy. I wasn't on-air talent, and I wasn't crafting the headlines. But I was in the room with some of the best journalists and producers in the industry. Just by proximity, I observed excellence.
I learned how producers think, how editors solve problems under pressure, how presenters prepare before interviews, and how to craft stories that mattered to a large audience.
Don't obsess over the title. Focus on being around people who are excellent at their craft and can challenge you to improve. The room will teach you more than the role.
For years, I believed my work would speak for itself. I worked hard, delivered results, and waited to be recognized. Spoiler alert: it doesn't work that way. Your visibility matters (sometimes more) than your performance.
Self-promotion doesn't mean arrogance; it means self-advocacy. It means ensuring your contributions are known to the right people — inside and outside the organization.
It means speaking up for yourself in meetings, regularly sharing wins without apology, and building a personal brand — even within your company walls.
It also means building a personal brand beyond your CV. Ensure your work is visible, so future opportunities can find you.
Careers don't accelerate because of skills alone. They accelerate through people. Every opportunity I've had in my career came from a person: someone who referred me, introduced me, or recommended me for a role.
In my 20s, I thought networking was about collecting business cards at events. Now I know it's about building relationships — genuine, long-term connections with people. The right community opens doors you didn't even know existed.
Your network is not just about where you want to go; it's about who you want to become. Surround yourself with people who are building lives and careers you admire.
When I finally launched my own business in 2017, I realized that side projects build confidence, networks, and a sense of freedom outside the 9-to-5.
I wish I had started earlier, not only because of the financial benefits but also because of the valuable experience. A side hustle teaches you skills that you may not always acquire at work, such as sales, marketing, and resilience. It also gives you proof that you can create something on your own terms.
I believe that every person should know how to earn money outside their 9-to-5 job. It keeps you edgy and also gives you the freedom to move on and not ""stay stuck"" in a role that isn't aligned anymore.
Even if your side hustle never becomes your full-time career, it can give you the courage to make bolder moves in your main job.
At 40, I'm paying what I call the ""health tax"" — late nights, skipped meals, and endless coffee runs.
In my 20s and 30s, I treated my body like an afterthought. But energy and health are career assets. Without them, success is not sustainable.
No promotion, paycheck, or title is worth burning out your body. I wish I had realized that rest, exercise, and healthy boundaries weren't luxuries; they were strategic career decisions.
At 40, I'm not lamenting what I didn't do. I'm grateful for the lessons I had to learn the hard way because they make me want to share them with the next generation of leaders, creators, and dreamers.
Your career becomes a series of rooms, relationships, and risks. A title on a business card is only temporary. But your expertise, reputation, health, and network will follow you everywhere you go.

29,2025-11-02,"ByGeorge Calhoun,

U.S. financial regulators will soon modify or rescind the 55-year old rule requiring public companies to issue formal financial reports every 90 days. 
Surveys of business leaders consistently reveal concerns about the cost and distraction of preparing and managing the short-cycle reporting process. They also provide evidence of a short-term bias in corporate decision-making, linked to the pressures of the current quarterly reporting cycle. There is an acknowledged tendency to sacrifice long-term strategic investments, alter accounting schedules, and incur other financial penalties (e.g., customer discounts for favorable purchase arrangements) in order to meet quarterly earnings targets.  
Meanwhile, academic and industry studies indicate that semiannual reporting does not impair, and may even improve, company performance, the functioning of financial markets, and the quality of financial information available to investors. 
Finally, the quarterly reporting regime has created a significant short-term disruption or distortion of trading patterns centered around the earnings announcement – dubbed the “Earnings Game” – characterized by abnormal volatility, evidence of mispricing and market anomalies or inefficiencies, an open door to market manipulation, and disadvantages for small investors in particular. 
In this Part 1, we will review the “big picture” arguments pro and con. In Part 2, the focus will be on the nature and consequences of the Earnings Game.
 
The United States stands alone (almost) among advanced economies in requiring quarterly financial reports from all public companies.  
The Securities and Exchange Commission enacted the quarterly reporting requirement in 1970. It has evolved into a highly structured, closely regulated framework which defines how companies communicate with the financial markets. 
Other countries have experimented with the American model – and then abandoned it. The European Union mandated quarterly reporting in 2004, but rescinded the rule in 2013. British regulators instituted a quarterly reporting requirement in 2007 – and repealed it seven years later. Singapore was quarterly for 17 years until 2020. Japan’s experiment with full quarterly reporting ran from 2003 to 2024. (Only Canada still follows the American example.) 
The SEC has now indicated that it wants to eliminate the quarterly reporting requirement in favor of semiannual reports by late next year, with full implementation expected by 2028.  It is of course controversial.
The arguments both for and against the proposed change tend to focus on how reporting frequency might influence the way companies are managed or the way markets function. Both sides often rely on deductions from “theory,” or simple appeals to “obviousness” – rather than hard evidence, which is scarce (for reasons discussed below). 
In the following sections, we’ll state the case for each side and review the available evidence.
The main argument for change is the claim that quarterly reporting encourages “short-termism” – a tendency for companies to sacrifice long-term growth and investment in favor of short-term measures aimed at boosting quarterly results. 
This was the rationale for ending mandatory quarterly reporting in the EU. 
The EU even sees a “problem” with companies that continue to issue quarterly reports voluntarily. Regulators are said to be considering “more draconian measures, including ways to discourage or ban listed companies from reporting on a quarterly basis” even when they are not required to do so.
UK regulators followed the recommendations of the Kay Report (authored by the prominent economist John Kay), which defined short-termism as “a tendency to under-investment, whether in physical assets or in intangibles such as product development, employee skills and reputation with customers” and sought ways to “reduce the pressures for short-term decision making that arise from excessively frequent reporting of financial and investment performance (including quarterly reporting by companies).” 
American critics of “quarterly capitalism” have included Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton (who coined the phrase), and Joe Biden, who wrote in 2016 that – 
Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan, and Warren Buffett have criticized the “short-termism that is harming the economy” driven by an “unhealthy focus on quarterly earnings.” Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, blames  “today’s culture of quarterly earnings hysteria” which is “totally contrary to the long-term approach we need.” David Solomon, CEO of Goldman Sachs, believes investors “can get adequate financial disclosure in two reporting cycles and it frees up both time and economic opportunity to really focus on the business and take a longer term view.”
Norway abolished quarterly reporting in that country in 2017, and the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund ($1.8 Tn) has proposed eliminating quarterly reporting for all public companies everywhere, citing the “risk of companies prioritizing short-term profits and the meeting of analyst forecasts over long-term investment, value creation and sustainable development.”
The former Chairman of Temasek, the Singapore sovereign wealth fund, cited the problem of short-termism among investors: “Issuing three-monthly updates on corporate performance does not improve transparency but does encourage investors to take a damagingly short-term view of their equity holding.”
The President of the New York Stock Exchange focused her comments on the “burdensome” cost of preparing and managing short-cycle financial reporting.
So, too, Nasdaq –
Many leaders of nonfinancial firms believe that eliminating this short-term bias would improve business operations. Unilever’s CEO said that after the company stopped issuing quarterly reports – 
The Vice-Chairman of General Motors concurred: “The search for quarterly earnings is the father of many, many bad product decisions.”
In sum, advocates of less frequent reporting argue that the current quarterly cycle tends to distort business decision-making, and thereby harms investors. It may even constitute a “threat to America’s enduring prosperity” (to again quote former President Biden).
 
Traditionalists in the financial establishment generally line up against the proposed change, and their opposition tends to be categorical. The Wall Street Journal called the proposal to abandon the quarterly reporting cycle “wrong in every possible way.”
They dismiss the short-termism argument out of hand –  “utter tosh”(again, The Wall Street Journal).  The general success of American business, and strong equity market valuations, are reason enough to reject it. 
 
 
Robust capital spending is also seen as proof that short-termism is a myth. 
Advocates of the status quo are worried about the negative consequences of less frequent reporting. Their arguments are based on classical Finance Theory. For example, the stock market (in theory) aggregates vast quantities of information about each company – its assets, its performance, its prospects, its customers, its competitive position in its sector, its role in the global economy – to calculate the correct current price and value of the company’s shares. Prices serve as signals to direct the proper allocation of capital.  More frequent updates must always be preferable… because… well, more information must be better than less information, right? “Less frequent reporting would lead to less information and riskier markets,” as well as “greater volatility in securities prices.” It would impair price discovery, and render markets less “efficient.” Distorted asset prices would cause capital misallocation and trigger a cascade of evils –
Other consequences of eliminating quarterly reporting could include:
In sum, opponents of change see the quarterly reporting cycle as a critical guard rail that, if removed, would alter the way markets work and the way public companies are managed, to the general detriment.
 
Many of these arguments are conjectural. For example, I know of no way to measure “market discipline” or to empirically estimate “misallocation of capital” on a quarterly or half-yearly basis.
Moreover, because all U.S. public companies have been required to report quarterly since 1970, there is no recent comparative data. Some studies have tried to reach back to find a point of reference before the rule change, in, say, the Eisenhower era.  However, the economy is much changed since then, as are the accounting and tax rules, the technology base, the financial markets, and management practices. 70-year-old data is just too stale.   
In other countries, however, where quarterly reporting is no longer required, some companies still do report voluntarily on a quarterly basis. EU firms are currently divided more or less equally between quarterly and half-yearly reporters, which sets up a plausible A/B comparison. (We will look at some of this data below, but there is an important caveat. Decisions about reporting frequency are not random. Many confounding factors are involved, including company size, the behavior of peers in the same sector, seasonality of the business, and management style.) 
The UK provides another natural experiment. Prior to 2014, quarterly reporting was mandatory. Today, “almost all” UK companies report semiannually. This sets up an interesting Pre-Post test (although there are possibly important differences between the two time periods).
All that said, and with the appropriate caveats – the non-U.S evidence supports a surprising conclusion: 
 
Analysts have compared quarterly and semiannual reporters in the EU and UK on the basis of:
 
The only recent study of the effect of reporting frequency on fundamental business performance comes from Goldman Sachs. Analysts compared the business performance of quarterly reporters and semiannual reporters in the EU Stoxx 600 index, and found little difference in return on equity, average net profit margins, and earnings per share growth. 
On the central question of short-termism, one approach is to look at levels of capital expenditure. Long-term investments should draw down earnings and net cash flows in the short term. A short-term bias would show up as a lower level of such investment at quarterly reporters compared with firms which do not report as frequently.
The UK offers a double test – first imposing a mandatory quarterly reporting requirement in 2007 and then removing it in 2014.  A study for the CFA Institute found that when quarterly reporting was imposed in 2007 it “had no material impact on the investment decisions of UK public companies.” 
When the mandate was lifted seven years later – 
A 2023 “Pre-Post” comparison in the UK examined the effect of reporting frequency on the quality of accounting information included in financial reports. The result was “counterintuitive.”  
An earlier study (2010) looked at the quality of information from the investors’ perspective. The result was also contrary to theory-based expectations.
The previously cited Goldman Sachs study found essentially no difference in the price-earnings ratios for quarterly vs semiannual reporting companies in the EU sample.  
 
 
A 2010 study assessed “share price informativeness” for quarterly and half-yearly reporters in several EU markets – a measure of pricing accuracy and market efficiency based on the speed with which share prices anticipate, capture and reflect new earnings information – the efficiency of the price discovery process. 
It was unaffected by reporting frequency. 
The same study looked at the surprise caused by the earnings announcement – conceptualized as the difference between investors’ earnings estimates and the actual results. It is measured by the level of abnormal volatility and trading volume on the announcement date. 
It turns out that earning surprises are not dampened by more frequent reporting. 
And –
Surprise reflects a disconnect between investors’ expectations and reality as revealed in the earnings announcement. It can be seen as an indication of the degree of mispricing in the market ahead of the earnings date. By this measure, quarterly reporting is associated with greater mispricing prior to the earnings release than semiannual reporting.
 
This is a powerful and important deduction from classical Finance Theory. It is likely true, to some degree, and is often repeated as an article of faith. It justifies the quarterly cycle (for advocates of the status quo).
 
The evidence is sketchy at best. “Cost of capital” is typically modeled rather than measured directly. The models depend on a set of complex assumptions, some of which are highly questionable. (For example, the “weighted average cost of capital” that all MBA students learn to calculate assumes that “perfect capital markets exist.”)
The issue can also seem to cut both ways. More frequent updates presumably reduce risk and lower the cost of capital for quarterly reporters. But if less frequent reporting is associated with higher quality financial information (as studies cited above show), that should also reduce uncertainty, reduce risk, and thereby reduce the cost of capital for semiannual reporters. One oft-cited study concludes simply that “the benefits of mandatory disclosures are likely to differ across firms.”
It should also be remarked that if a company is topically concerned about its cost of capital – say, in connection with a forthcoming funding round – it can always release information on a more frequent basis voluntarily. (And of course, material events must always be disclosed by means of an 8-K filing.) 
 
Then there is the question of mindset, or bias. 
A survey of 400 Chief Financial Officers of U.S. public companies published in 2005 found that “a surprising 78% of the sample admits to sacrificing long-term value” in order to “smooth earnings.” Nearly 40% said they would give discounts to customers to accelerate future spending plans to increase the company’s reportable sales in the current quarter – forfeiting a percentage of revenue to buff up the 10-Q. 
 
The payoff is said to be predictability.
 
At the very least, such measures muddy the quality of the information provided to investors, and may shade towards illegal manipulation. Earnings management and/or manipulation has been the subject of dozens of academic studies, with a variety of definitions and methodologies, so that estimates of the prevalence of these practices vary widely. But it seems clear that the pressure of quarterly reporting deadlines can warp managerial decisions in many cases.
So, with regard to “short-termism” the evidence seems mixed. The UK accounting data say no, but survey results confirm a short-term bias among U.S. executives, which is significantly exacerbated by the earnings calendar.  
That said – after five decades, U.S. public company executives are by now fully habituated to the quarterly reporting cycle – and as opponents of change readily point out, American economic exceptionalism seems unimpaired. Compared to other countries, U.S. businesses are more profitable, the market values of U.S. public companies are higher, and U.S. strategic leadership in many sectors of the global economy (e.g., Tech, Finance, Pharma and Energy) is clear cut. It could be argued that somehow short-termism has served the U.S. economy very well. Perhaps it is an antidote for the complacency which otherwise tends to infect the management mindset in all large and successful organizations.
 
So, short-term biases may exist, but do they matter? Does quarterly reporting help or harm the company and its investors? Would less frequent reporting impair market functioning?
The hard evidence, such as it is, suggests that reporting frequency has very little effect, perhaps favoring semiannual reporting slightly. 
Ambiguity encourages both sides. The New York Times – which leans towards maintaining the status quo – summarized “numerous studies [that] found no discernible improvements in corporate planning or performance in countries where [less frequent reporting] has been tried” – implying no need for change.  But a semantically equivalent rephrasing – “Numerous studies found no discernible difference in corporate planning or performance related to reporting frequency” – could equally well support the argument for joining the global consensus.
 
And there may be very good reasons to do so. 
Quarterly capitalism has created what has come to be called the “Earnings Game”– where company managers, analysts, and investors maneuver for advantage in the turmoil before and after the official earnings release. It generates a characteristic distortion of the market, and a symbiotic distortion of management behavior. The quality of financial information is often compromised. Mispricings develop. Trading is abnormal and even chaotic. The participants are tempted to pursue quasi-adversarial and sometimes dysfunctional strategies, which open the door to market manipulation, inspire or reinforce short-termist biases in business decision-making, and increase the overall risk for investors. It is likely that retail investors in particular are disadvantaged, trading against professionals who have developed sophisticated techniques for exploiting the market anomalies created by the earnings game.
Part 2 of this column will examine this game and its consequences, which make a stronger case for changing the current reporting cycle than the shallow theoretical arguments that have dominated the debate so far.  "
30,2025-11-02,"Molecule, a pill promising rapid weight loss, went viral on Russian TikTok earlier this year.
Young people's feeds started filling up with captions like ""Take Molecule and forget food exists"", and ""Do you want to sit in the back of the class in oversized clothes?""
Clips showed fridges lined with blue boxes featuring holograms and ""Molecule Plus"" labels.
The orders began piling in, as teenagers shared their ""weight-loss journeys"" on social media.
But there was a catch.
Maria, 22, had purchased the pill from a popular online retailer. She took two pills per day and, after two weeks, says her mouth dried up and she completely lost her appetite.
""I had absolutely no desire to eat, let alone drink. I was nervous. I was constantly biting my lips and chewing my cheeks.""
Maria developed severe anxiety and began having negative thoughts. ""These pills were having a profound effect on my psyche,"" she says.
Maria, who lives in St Petersburg, says she wasn't prepared for such severe side effects.
Other TikTok users mentioned dilated pupils, tremors and insomnia. And at least three schoolchildren are reported to have ended up in hospital.
In April, a schoolgirl in Chita, Siberia, needed hospital care after overdosing on Molecule. According to local reports, she was trying to lose weight quickly, in time for the summer.
The mother of another schoolgirl told local media her daughter was admitted to intensive care after taking several pills at once.
And in May, a 13-year-old boy from St Petersburg needed hospital care after experiencing hallucinations and panic attacks. He had reportedly asked a friend to buy him the pill because he was being teased at school about his weight.
The packaging for Molecule pills often lists ""natural ingredients"" such as dandelion root and fennel seed extract.
But earlier this year, journalists at the Russian newspaper Izvestiya submitted pills they had purchased online for testing and found they contained a substance called sibutramine.
First used as an antidepressant in the 1980s and later as an appetite suppressant, studies later found sibutramine increased the risk of heart attacks and strokes - while only slightly promoting weight loss.
It was banned in the US in 2010, and is also illegal in the UK, EU, China and other countries.
In Russia, it is still used to treat obesity, but available only to adults and by prescription. 
Purchasing and selling sibutramine without a prescription is a criminal offence. But that hasn't stopped individuals and small businesses from selling it online - often in higher doses than legal medication - and without requiring prescriptions.
The unlicensed pills cost about £6-7 ($8-9) for a 20-day supply - much cheaper than recognised weight-loss injections like Ozempic, which on the Russian market sell for £40-160 ($50-210) per monthly pen.
""Self-administration of this drug is very unsafe,"" says endocrinologist Ksenia Solovieva from St Petersburg, warning of potential overdose risks, ""because we do not know how much of the active ingredient such 'dietary supplements' may contain"".
Russians regularly receive prison sentences for purchasing and reselling Molecule pills. But it's proving difficult for authorities to get a grip on the drug being sold illegally.
In April, the government-backed Safe Internet League reported the growing trend involving young people to the authorities - prompting several major online marketplaces to remove Molecule from sale. But it soon began appearing online under a new name, Atom, in near-identical packaging.
A law was recently passed allowing authorities to block websites selling ""unregistered dietary supplements"" without a court order - but sellers have been getting around this by categorising them as ""sports nutrition"" instead.
On TikTok, you can find retailers selling Molecule under listings that look like they are for muesli, biscuits and even lightbulbs. And some retailers aren't even trying to hide it any more.
A few weeks ago, the BBC found Molecule listings on a popular Russian online marketplace. When approached for comment, the site said it had promptly removed any products containing sibutramine. But it admitted it was difficult to find and remove listings that didn't explicitly mention sibutramine.
If you do manage to get your hands on Molecule, it's hard to know exactly what you're getting - and it's unclear where the pills are being manufactured.
The BBC found some sellers with production certificates from factories in Guangzhou and Henan, in China. Others claim to be sourcing the pills from Germany.
Some packets state they were produced in Remagen in Germany - but the BBC has discovered there is no such company listed at the address given.
Certain Kazakh vendors selling Molecule to Russians told the BBC they bought stock from friends or warehouses in the capital Astana but couldn't name the original supplier.
Meanwhile, online eating-disorder communities have become spaces where Molecule is promoted, with users relying on hashtags and coded terms to slip past moderation.
Ms Solovieva says Molecule is particularly harmful when taken by young people who already have eating disorders. For those in or near relapse, an easily available appetite suppressant can be seriously dangerous, she says.
Anna Enina, a Russian influencer with millions of followers who herself has admitted using unlicensed weight-loss pills in the past, publicly warned her subscribers: ""As someone who has struggled with an eating disorder... the consequences will be dire. You'll regret it tenfold.""
Twenty-two-year old Maria suffered bad side effects, and is one of those who regrets it. After taking too many Molecule pills, she was sent to hospital.
Now she discourages other young women and girls from taking the pills in weight-loss forums. She even reached out to one teenage user's parents to alert them.
But Molecule remains popular online.
And every video that appears on Maria's TikTok feed is a reminder of the pills that made her sick.
Some high-street clinics are risking lives by letting untrained staff do baby scans, warn experts.

Garlic, alcohol, meat and even fasting can affect our body odour – and alter how appealing our scent is to others.

PALABEK, Northern Uganda — Imagine if you were a refugee living at a makeshift settlement in a foreign country with no way to earn a steady income.
Then someone promised you a life-changing opportunity: They'd give you a sum of money and a coach to help you turn it into a source of income.
But just as you are about to receive that support, it gets canceled.
That's what happened to some 8,100 South Sudanese refugees in Uganda this year. They were enrolled in a program with a bureaucratic name — Graduating to Resilience Scale Activity — and a simple strategy: a $205 sum for each participant along with coaching to start a small business.
That may not seem like a lot of money, but in Uganda, the average annual income is $753.

                Irene Atoo harvests peanuts and literally gets paid in peanuts that she brings home to feed her family. Atoo has two daughters and is also caring for her younger sister and niece. She was one of the nearly 3,500 Ugandan locals who were set to participate in a program run by the charity AVSI to ""graduate"" people from poverty before funding was terminated by the Trump administration.

And in the Palabek camp, home to about 100,000 refugees, most people have no way to earn a living other than occasional farming work, at best making $2 a week. The camp is just around 30 miles away from the border with South Sudan, were a civil war and ethnic violence that began in 2013 led tens of thousands of people — many on foot — to flee to Uganda. New refugees continue to arrive every day as conditions in South Sudan remain unstable. 
Before the Trump administration's aid cuts, the residents of the camp relied mainly on food or cash from aid groups to survive. 

                A view of the home of Michael Obwoya, 49, who was set to participate in the AVSI program along with some 3,500 Ugandan households. The arrival of tens of thousands of refugees in the area has been a strain for locals as they share limited land, water and firewood resources.

Last year the U.S. government awarded a $15 million grant to the nonprofit group AVSI Foundation to set up what's known as a ""Graduation Approach"" program serving the refugee and host communities. The goal was that in three years, the participants would ... graduate ... from extreme poverty and become self-supporting. In past studies, similar programs with a onetime cash award plus coaching have produced a ""significant"" increase in the income of participants after 24 months. 
In addition to the refugee households, some 3,500 Ugandans living in extreme poverty near the settlement were to participate. The arrival of tens of thousands of refugees in the area has been a strain for locals as they have had to share limited land, water, and firewood resources with refugees. While the refugees can get some help from aid groups, locals often are overlooked, and AVSI's program aimed to bridge some of that gap. 

                Florence Amungo, 34, a refugee from South Sudan, now lives at Palabek Refugee Settlement in Northern Uganda. Amungo was enrolled in a program to help people ""graduate"" from poverty — then found out the program was cut. She had hoped to raise pigs to support her household of 14 people — her husband, their five biological children and other children that she cares for.

In February 2025 the grant to AVSI was abruptly nullified — along with thousands of other programs around the world — as part of the overhaul of foreign aid set in motion by the Trump administration.
In the letters the administration sent out to non-profit groups like AVSI, it said the terminated programs were not aligned with U.S. national interests. 
AVSI — founded in Italy in 1972 as the Association of Volunteers in International Service — had to lay off 140 local staff recently hired for the Palabek project, according to Rita Larok, the director of programs.
As difficult as it was to let staff go, Larok says it was even harder to break the news to the participants, who saw the project as their only way to becoming self-sufficient. Their ""hopes and dreams [were] shattered,"" she says.
The disappointment of the lost opportunity has reverberated through the settlement and local towns, says Ugandan official Fivi Akullu, the Refugee Desk Officer for the settlement. 
""If the U.S. government had a heart, actually, this [funding cut] should have been done phase by phase,"" she says. ""It was a very drastic decision to say this is it. No funding, no nothing.""

                Fivi Akullu, 36, is the refugee desk officer for the Office of the Prime Minister at Palabek Refugee Settlement in Northern Uganda. Every morning when she arrives at her office in the camp, she sees lines of people waiting to speak with her: women, children, elderly. ""Sometimes I don't even have words, because it's too much, and I cannot help everyone. It really hurts,"" Akullu says.

NPR reached out to the State Department for comment but did not receive a response.
On a trip to Uganda, NPR interviewed some of the individuals affected by the cancellation.
Akim Joseph Yanga was excited about the cash and the coaching. The 63-year-old planned to buy as many as 5 goats — that's what $205 would cover — and start a small livestock business. He was counting on the program coach to help him figure out the logistics of the business and how to best use his skills to build it.
The AVSI project gave people hope, says Yanga, who'd fled South Sudan in 2019 because of conflict. And in the wake of the program's dissolution, he and other camp officials have seen signs of despair: an increase in cases of violence that have required his mediation, including domestic violence and thefts of neighbors' chickens or goats. There have even been several suicide attempts, he says. 

                Akim Joseph Yanga, 63, is a refugee from Juba in South Sudan and a village leader in the Palabek Refugee Settlement in Northern Uganda. He was also set to be a participant in the USAID-funded program to lift people out of poverty. He'd hoped to start a livestock business.

""It is true that when our father, Donald Trump, started reducing the [foreign aid] budget globally. It affected us very seriously,"" Yanga says, adding that he calls the U.S. president ""father"" because he sees him as a provider to vulnerable people around the world.
Yanga has been telling disappointed families in the camp not to lose hope. 
""My message to them is let us be resilient. God will not forget us. The Samaritans will come and help us.""
Santa Angwech, a 26-year-old single mom with three children, saw the AVSI program as a lifeline. In anticipation of growing a business with the program, she started making cassava chips to sell in the market from cassava she'd planted in front of her hut, with seeds she had received from aid groups. 
More so than the money, she was looking forward to what the coaches would teach her: how to build the business, save money, grow additional crops and even how to deal with the gender-based violence that is part of camp life.

                Santa Angwech shows the corn she has harvested from a local farm. She says it will last her family about 2 weeks. She and her family have been mostly depending on aid groups for food. Angwech saw the USAID-funded program to lift people out of poverty as her only way to self-sufficiency.

In February, she received a text message from AVSI that the program had shut down.
""I was completely hopeless when I saw the message.
""The big question that I have is how you can solve my problems. That is the only thing I need, because if I know how to solve the problem, nothing will defeat me,"" Angwech says.

                Santa Angwech's son drew a picture of their family on a mud wall of their home.

She's not angry at the U.S. for its decision to cut aid. ""You cannot be angry [at] somebody who refused to give you something because you are just a beggar,"" she says. 
Instead, she prays that funding will flow again soon: ""If they do not help us? Where should we start from? What should we do? There is nothing.""
For Okot Bosco, 36, the new AVSI program was an opportunity he could only have dreamed of as a refugee at the camp — the former teacher had been hired as a coach to guide participants for the 3-year duration of the project. Now he's lost this job — and his hope of using his salary from AVSI to pay back a loan he'd taken from a local bank to build up a small shop selling basic household items. 
He's now struggling with supporting his children and wife and has taken up farming work.
Bosco believes that President Trump, in making these cuts, doesn't understand that not only do recipients of aid benefit — America, as the giver, does too.

                Akim Joseph Yanga, left, speaks with with Bosco Okot, who began working with with AVSI's program in Palabek as a coach to help people build small businesses until the program was terminated as a result of USAID funding cuts.

""When you're in a problem and someone helps you, you will never forget that person.""
That philosophy is reflected in his own life. He was born in a displaced persons camp during the Sudanese civil war of the 1980s. 
""I grew up seeing this logo of USAID on the cooking oil can and food boxes — knowing that Americans are the people who can support us in food, education, in medicine, in everything,"" Bosco says. ""America benefits, but they don't know that they are benefiting. They benefit because the people trust them so much."""

This as-told-to essay is based on conversations with Christina Kantzavelos, 37, a therapist and chronic illness advocate based in Óbidos, Portugal, a town about 52 miles north of Lisbon. She left California at the end  of 2022 and lived nomadically in Europe until settling in Portugal in 2024. She still rents a home in California and has clients in the US. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
It was early summer of 2024 that I first decided that I wanted to make Portugal my permanent home.
I've been to a lot of different countries in Europe, and I've had the privilege of visiting and spending longer periods of time in them. For me, Portugal just feels the most comfortable. There's a lot happening where you feel like you can be involved or contribute to the community very easily. There's an openness, and I like that there's a mixture of locals as well as foreigners. I have felt very welcomed here so far.
It's nice to know things are happening and going on. I'm not that far from Lisbon, where a lot of bands come to play. And I love the access to nature and the good weather — it's reminiscent of California, where I grew up. It's a very nice balance.
I love the fact that sunshine is just a drive away, even if it seems like it's raining somewhere. You can be at the beach and in the snow, theoretically, on the same day. There are just so many rivers and beautiful hikes, and the air just seems so clear. Those are the aspects of the lifestyle I enjoy.
Overall, my nervous system just feels safer here. For me, it really comes down to my health and the fact that I feel better overall. I just feel less inflamed, more energized, more vibrant overall.
I work mostly Pacific Standard Time; however, I coach clients from the Midwest to the East Coast and also internationally.
It's pretty ideal. Generally speaking, I wrap up around 10 p.m., so I'm in bed at a reasonable hour.
It's been great to have slow mornings. It's nice that I can go see doctors, or go get treatments, or go do things that are related and helpful to my health during the day, and get that over with, and then work. I actually really like that switch of workflow.
People here seem to work to live versus live to work in the US.
I feel like in the US it is shifting in a healthier direction, but the lifestyle in Portugal seems more conducive to living, and I really enjoy that.
It's also more affordable overall. I try to eat mostly organic, and I can do that here more affordably versus in the US, where I'd be left with very little money at the end of the month.
For two people, between the grocery store and the farmer's market, a week's worth of groceries costs 125 euros, or about $145. Eating mostly organic food, that would've easily cost me closer to $300.
I rent my house in Joshua Tree, California, which is a little bit more affordable than big cities where I was before, like San Diego and Los Angeles. For point of reference, my three-bedroom, 2,000-square-foot apartment in Portugal is 1,300 euros a month.
For something like this in San Diego, this would probably be at least $5,000 a month for a location where I am walking distance to town and for what I have access to.
Where I am, I feel like there's a lot around community and families: they're doing family dinners on Sunday, where everyone gets together, or group lunches. There are a lot of festivals, and there are a lot of community events.
I'm a European citizen and I'm now a resident of Portugal; however, I still don't have access to their healthcare, so everything is out of pocket. 
It's still less expensive: I went to the osteopath, and I paid 40 euros for an hour of treatment. Seeing an osteopath out of pocket in California was quite expensive — it was $275 for 30 minutes.
I have to get weekly lymphatic massages for one of my health conditions. And for an hour and a half, I pay 40 euros. To receive that in California, I think it was closer to $175 for an hour and a half.
When I was living in Greece, I needed a small emergency surgery, and I was charged 50 euros for that — and that was at a private institution. If I'd gone to an ER in the US, that would've probably cost me $5,000.
I know folks who've had to open a GoFundMe for their healthcare. That just doesn't make sense that we need to crowdfund to get our healthcare covered when we pay so much for health insurance in the US. I see it almost every day in my work, insurance denying someone's health treatment.
It's depressing. It breaks my heart. I'm so grateful that I have this privilege, but it doesn't make sense that we should have to leave our own country to be able to afford to be healthy.
Nervous system dysregulation is tied so closely to our health — the mind-body component is huge. If we're not feeling comfortable or safe in the environment we're living in, it can impact our health big time. I've noticed a really huge difference in my overall health, even without the treatments here.
I've received only love, support, and curiosity from my clients thus far. I feel so much better. I do feel like I'm fully able to take care of my health and feel confident, safe, and secure in where I am.
It's not rare that we go overseas or to different states or places for our health. If we go somewhere and we realize, ""Wow, I see a difference,"" it's worthwhile for us to make the move.

“Why are we obsessed with serial killers?”
What you mean ‘we’, white man? I don’t know why people become serial killers nor do I even care. I only know what should be done with them – and with extreme prejudice.
“Why are we obsessed with serial killers?”
Maybe because the killer in me is the killer in you…. 
Disarm, by Billy Corgan
So I’ve watched a few of these series below on the central villain, and there is overlap of a kind, like deciphering whether the cult leader( ie, Jeffs ) or the serial killer is actually the worse and more effective evil.  Exerting control seems to be a recurring theme.
– Jeffrey Dahmer
– Warren Jeffs and the FLDS cult ( polygamy )
– Ted Bundy
– John Wayne Gacy
– Zodiac 
These are all dark, and highly disturbing.  I include the last entry since per the film, released in 2007 and possibly overlooked then, the alleged murderer was never actually caught or arrested for his crimes.   My conclusion…some people are just not wired correctly from the get to.
I actually have been a little curious about what the big deal is. Where I live, gang members have tens of bodies under their belts. There’re also a whole host of famous people who should be called serial killers but aren’t, like Obama. As far as I can tell, the only difference is that they lack individual notoriety for their crimes, for one reason or the other.
The article doesn’t address this at all, unless I missed it and I would agree that the author’s reported curiousity may be less ubiquitous than they believe. It seems to me like the fascination with learning how other persons met with a miserable end is a phenomenom driven by news outlets (traditional and novel) hyping up particularly unique cases as a relatively easy sell for views/clicks etc..
The difference in the treatment is just stark. My news is always filled with the more prolific of the twenty or so deaths over the last week, sometimes barely afforded a paragraph because it’s the same old story over and over. Even when bodies do get found in pieces it’s not particularly earth-shattering. As far as I can tell, it seems to be that having a hundred known victims can never live up to the hype of leaving three of four bodies in sculpted positions. ‘Slasher’ enthusiasts, I’m sure, hardly care to learn how Joe went from selling his body for food to doing his part, keeping morticians securely employed.
Mass murderers, spree killers, serial killers are categories, but I guess the category closest to covering officially protected perps would be something like “state sponsorsed terrorism”.
US media is obsessed with serial killers (‘we’ means them), because shocking content attracts audience. It’s softcore atrocity porn.
A polarizing film but one I think captured this well was Oliver Stone’s “Natural Born Killers”.  It’s too graphic and psychedelic for some but the way it portrays the media hype and popular fandom around a duo of serial killers was phenomenal in my opinion. Takes the old adage of “If it bleeds, it leads” and turned the dial up to eleven to critique the 90’s era tabloid news like Hard Copy. 
Not sure if there are any modern equivalents but to me that film still holds up and remains relevant.
In an awful comparison, serial killers are tantamount to aces in that you need 5 kills to establish yourself as such.
Note to gun nuts intent on doing your worst:
Any outcome in the single-digits is pretty much yeah whatever as far as Presstidigitation is concerned. It might not even make the front page of the internet-such is fate.
By serial killers, do they mean social murders? Kills more people than any serial killer ever has.
On the AI front, this below in today’s FT reporting the same thing that commenter Rasperry Jam has been saying, that much of AI’s immediate future is in specialized foundation models using proprietary data.

The new hot job in AI: forward-deployed engineers
OpenAI, Anthropic and Cohere have stepped up hiring for specialists to help businesses adopt their AI models
‘…Anthropic, OpenAI and Cohere are recruiting for so-called forward-deployed engineers, a new job for generative AI companies, as part of a push to generate more revenues by installing specialists within businesses to help them customise their AI models….
‘…The move comes as businesses across industries from manufacturing to healthcare are increasingly keen to adopt AI tools, but are often unsure how to use the technology and generate a return on investment. “A Fortune 500 bank has completely different needs than a start-up building an AI-native product,” said Cat de Jong, head of applied AI at Anthropic ….
‘While FDEs (forward-deployed engineers) represent a relatively small number of AI groups’ workforce, OpenAI said demand for these roles has exceeded its expectations.
‘The group used this approach to customise its technology for John Deere, an agricultural machinery manufacturer, to help create more precise farming tools. This resulted in farmers reducing chemical spraying by 60 per cent to 70 per cent.
‘OpenAI’s Fournier said: “We learn what customers in different industries really need, we experiment and innovate together, and then those insights help advance OpenAI’s research and product offerings based on what works in the real world.”
Me: This is AI coming for McKinsey, Bain, and the like.
i.e. Customers used to contract with a management consultancy firm, which then outourced a majority of work to an IT consultancy firm (ITF) that in turn might do 90% of work for 10% of contract value and the MCF took the rest. Any true value lay in which ITF the management consultant firm had the nous to choose. 
With AI, the ITF — in this case, OpenAI, Anthropic, whichever– disintermediates McKinsey etc. and assigns their role to its own forward development engineers.
So if those forward-deployed engineers are working with a Fortune 500 bank or a corporation like John Deere to tailor those AIs to them individually, would it also work out that they would also be funneling those corporation’s vital information back to Anthropic, OpenAI and Cohere for use as training set data?
Yup.
One thought, suppose there are better, more efficient AI models than Anthropic or Claude, buying into solution before problem….
Don’t rule out consulting yet.
How about small language modules?
Open labs* are raining small language models right now, some under 1B parameters, which is small enough to work (with patience) on any laptop. Most recently, LiquidAI published open-weight small models specialized for retrieval-augmented generation, summarization, information extraction, and mathematics. There has been a lot of recent work in vision and OCR surfacing recently as well. Small models are becoming more capable and efficient not only to encode or translate the text of a page or sign or describe a photo, but correctly read and reproduce sparse tables or describe the actions occurring between two video frames (with bounding boxes). 
* By open labs I mean those whose corporate future is not dependent on a world where all inference is centralized in a proprietary cloud, and who are not so motivated to hoard their IP or models. OpenAI and Anthropic, contrariwise, are worthless unless they can force the Western world to channel all its mechanical language processing through their machines and their meters. I think of OpenAI and Anthropic much like Uber, as regulatory plays intending to construct a regulatory environment in which the highly moderated service they offer is socially necessary, and alternatives are rendered illegal, unmerchantable, or impossible.
Reminder that the “anti”-AI movement is only a shaping operation in the larger war against local computation, and, being mainly funded and operated by US AI services majors, national security goons, and washed-up pundits trying to uphold a lifestyle, should only ever be held with the same absolute suspicion and cynical hostility as any other corporate astroturf.
The myth is not entirely wrong for some health conditions. My mother-in-law had polio as an infant. At some point in her seventies and eighties she (and the medical profession discovered that her muscles only had so many contractions in them and that the exercises she had been doing to maintain her strength were weakening her.
Sounds like Lean Six Sigma “black belts”.
Maybe if Toyota did AI…..
Do these OpenAI deployed engineers have the business sense, to replace the usual business process redesign “help”
The “forwards deployed” vocabulary is very militaristic. This strategy of embedding technical staff in the client on an open-ended consulting / brain-siphoning engagement is held up as the secret of Palantir’s “success”. I wonder if the buzzword comes from them too….
Anyway, we’re doing exactly this with our AI Fintech, building a very niche model and, yes, hiring forward deployed engineers for its deployment.
Hell’s bells, those photos of the ultra-refined pizza(s) are ridiculous. 
As every Italian knows, pizza is its own food group, but there are rules. (Although in the Undisclosed Region the use of ingredients and doughs has some jazz-like variations, given that pizza is an exotic import from Naples and not original to the Chocolate City.)
Lobster and caviar defeat the purpose of pizza, which is as a comfort food that doesn’t have too much meat or fish on top. It is the dough that matters.
Second, I am seeing two other pizzas that aren’t pizzas. I’m not sure what the photos represent. They seem to be of a taco masquerading as a pizza — pieces of burnt sausage with raw lettuce, raw tomatoes, and sliced pickles? Or is this pizzaoidal object a discreet reference to Donald Trump’s eating habits?
So these gold-foiled pizzas with pickles are a long way from a real pizza — which reaches the splendor of pizza when topped with cheese and squash blossoms. Or one of those jazzy Piedmontese variations (served at my Undisclosed Favorite Pizzeria): sauce of porcini, topped with porcini and a delicate Piedmontese cheese that is softer and a tad more savory than mozzarella. (Not that I’m complaining about mozzarella!)
Heck, why waste a sturgeon’s time like this?
PS: From Renato Viola’s home page, I discover that he has decamped to Miami, South Beach. Sic transit gloria pizzae.
Thank you! I second that it’s the dough/crust first and foremost.
I enjoy anchovies (with capers and red onion, please) from time to time, and have even once made a lobster pizza (it was tasty!), but these are not what I crave when I’m craving pizza.
The State of Maine pizza, bacon and onion, is one of my favorites.
mrsyk:
anchovies (with capers and red onion, please)
Anchovies are an object of veneration in the Undisclosed Region — especially the big anchovies from Spain or Sicily.
So I understand your weaknesses.
Once at my son’s urging we did a lobster fried rice as he said St Tony Bourdain had it. We did it without my wife present (the chef, the boss). It was good. Later my son said he made it up about Tony.
There is a fancier Chinese restaurant nearby that makes a lobster fried rice and it’s delicious!  They also do a nice dim sum lobster rangoon.  
I wouldn’t do lobster on a pizza [or mashed potatoes(!), looking at you Barstool-reviewed local Maine pizza place that is otherwise very good], but I find that substituting real lobster for the generally faux crabmeat in Asian cuisine is a nice touch.
Horrible faux crabmeat is a nasty substitution for… real crab. Up here, on the BC Coast, the real thing is thankfully far more common — fake crab is extremely rare in Chinese restaurants, much more common in bad or mediocre Japanese restaurants, the latter often having both California Rolls and California Rolls with Real Crab on the menu.
Saladizzas? Note ingredients seem to have been added after the pizza is done. Weird. I myself have done some weird dishes as I sometimes tried to be creative with mixed results. Paella madrás  comes to mind. That one was edible and quite a thing though I have not tried twice. With time my “creativity” has mostly gone and now I stick most of the time with traditional recipes even if some are new to me.
No garlic in the Spanish omelette then? (I’m torn on this one.)
Onion, onion! And you can do it “campera” (country-side) with added pepper and chorizo.
One bite, everybody knows the rules! 
In our town we used to have a pizza place called the Pizza Research Institute (PRI) that had the most unusual pizza toppings I’ve ever encountered.  Many of my friends raved about it but as a half-Sicilian pizza traditionalist I had to be dragged kicking and screaming to try them.  Unfortunately I really did like their pizza (except anything with Gorgonzola, a cheese apparently made from someone’s very dirty underwear).
Example:  the 3-P ….. pear, potato, and pesto.  I know, I know…but it was brilliant.
Laughingsong: Sicilian pizza (which is not sfinciune, which is wonderful) is what we in Chicago used to call the pizza of risen dough with much tomato sauce and very little cheese. You’d buy it buy the rectangle at certain bakeries. Oh, no, I feel Proust’s pizza calling…
Note on sfinciune: I bought a slice of sfinciune at a nice grocery store in Palermo. It was ambrosial.  Cheesy, plus a topping of gratinata, lots of breadcrumbs. Give it a try.
Pear, potato, and pesto. The problem is that the pear’s elegant sweetness competes with the pesto’s wonderful perfume. The umami of the potato can’t rescue that threesome. That’s one of the dangers of threesomes.
Now: Here in the Undisclosed Region you’d get potato, pesto, and hazelnuts (another object of veneration) or walnuts. Yumliziosa.
Yeah, I dunno what any of that is.
I did a Neapolitan style 10.5″ last night with a pizza oven, cooked up in about 2 minutes, starts to seriously burn at that point actually. Amazingly puffy but thin crust, overnight yeasted dough, just 00 flour, yeast, water, a bit of salt, and 1/8″ teaspoon of olive oil and a bit of amylase.
Pesto, fresh basil, mozzarella cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, and scallions.
Best thing ever.
About “Entrepreneurship in Europe: Where are firms thriving and barely surviving? ”
As far as I can tell what the data shows is mostly about how easy and cheap it is to set up and close down shell-companies. I.e. financial shenanigans that on balance is probably damaging both economy and lives.
I did not see any reference to that being part of the explanation, either the author is blissfully unaware of that or the author is aware and decided not to include it anywhere in the article.
Might be a combination of unaware and being slightly aware but digging into it and writing about it might not be good for career and social prospects.
“Opinion: Why Trump’s talk about nuclear testing is dangerous”
I’m thinking that it was defensive here. The Russians had just announced the successful testing of their nuclear-powered cruise missile, the Burevestnik. This was followed up by the successful testing of their nuclear-powered torpedo, the Poseidon. For the Neocons, this was bad news. It is one thing setting countries on fire in the Middle east or Africa or South America. They told themselves that they were safe as they had an ocean on each side, Arctic wastes to the north and a narrow peninsular to the south. With these new weapons that obsolete belief is dead. Trump had to throw up a distraction so that people would forget those new Russian weapons so came up with nuclear testing and it has worked. Only thing is whether Trump boxes himself in and is forced to conduct a nuclear test in a year or two from now because of all his belligerent boasting.
It was another childish gesture. (Mine’s bigger than yours.) Quotidian Trumpian bravado. It’s not easy being a narcissist.
My best guess is he doesn’t know the difference between nuclear powered and nuclear armed.
I read someone point out trumps testing talk came just after his TACO with China.
It’s round 10 million of SQUIRREL 
Nuclear testing is under the energy department, not the military. It would take probably years to put together the entire nuclear test program again before a single test could be completed.
Historians will look back on 2025 as the US empire’s  Suez year, with not just China’s successful pushback against US efforts to stop its rise but also Russia’s crushing of the Ukraine regime and the US-NATO proxy effort to regime change Russia.
But, yes: 2030, if the Chinese perform a landing on Luna, is when this change will finally be absorbed by the mass of Americans. Those in DC will likely be the last to face the facts.
Here’s The Duran weighing in on this, and I have the same concerns:
Poseidon and Trump nuclear testing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugtS1clYjEI
Plus, they also discuss the myth that Reagan “won” the Cold War with an arms race, and yes, it’s a myth. I don’t know the details of what brought the USSR down, but I dare say that having old, out of touch, corrupt leadership class that caused great internal disarray was a much greater reason for the USSR’s collapse. (And I see parallels in America’s leadership today, bummer that!)

Nexperia allowed to resume exports from China following Trump-Xi talks — companies may seek exemptions from the Ministry of Commerce to restart international deliveries Tom’s Hardware
It appears that the USA’s famously brilliant negotiator of a president may not have understood what he agreed to with regard to Nexperia in his recent discussions with Xi. Per Arnaud Bertrand, the main value added by Nexperia NL to the supply chain of chips used in the auto industry is the production of the silicon wafers. Nexperia CN has now re-sourced those wafers domestically, which will leave Nexperia NL to wither away and the American and European auto producers even more dependent on China. Good job, wheeler-dealer Don.
There are still propaganda pieces in the Netherlands that Karremans did a great and heroic thing in stealing Nexperia.
I always knew that the Dutch press was mostly propaganda, but sometimes it is still a surprise for me when they lie about something.
so I scrolled through news sites….no mention of the World Series, lmao.  (the secular, structural decline of baseball is another topic).  
Society/mass culture has become, essentially, circles of “fandoms”—politics, sports, celebrity news, baking, widget-collecting, etc.    There is no more universal (national) cultural glue holding society together (except, a John Carpenter-esque: consume!)
pretty wild that we live in an age where almost every First Worlder has a supercomputer in their pocket, and people have siloed themself into their own world with their own IV drip of info.  it’s like a scene from “Wall-E”

The only hint of violence on the diamond sputtered out during an ad hoc 7th inning stretch yesterday, but it was more of an Elks Club get together with no rabbit punches or fisticuffs to report and both teams dutifully went back to their respective dugouts…
In comparison, I cringe about 6.3x a game during an NFL get together-when violence on the gridiron seems almost like a gut punch to watch. A lot of the skills are similar, throwing, running, catching and hitting-with a different variant on the latter.
That was a World Series for the ages-one astounding play on the field after another, and I had mentally consigned myself to being on the losing side of an epic battle fought over 90 feet at a time in the 9th inning, satisfied in that i’d witnessed something special-and then redeemed by home run heroics by the least likely guy on the rosters to clear the fence.
p,s,
money, money, money dept:
Disney owned the Angels around the turn of the century, and in their wisdom decided to trash all of the older players contracts, which were dutifully retrieved by a dumpster diver, and then sold to a coin dealer in Orange County.
The ‘money’ one was Nolan Ryan’s yearly contracts, of which there were about 10 or so, and Nolan didn’t make jack, $27k.
I must’ve read through hundreds of player contracts, got a little dull after awhile
ah ha
The internet has everything!
Here’s the 1972 Nolan Ryan contract, and oh so plain Jane~
It fetched $6k in 2012 @ auction
https://collectrea.com/archives/2012/Spring/767/1972-nolan-ryan-signed-california-angels-contract-first-american-league-contract
On Nolan Ryan, when I worked at corporate HQ office of a local retail bank in Plano, Texas, circa 2011 to early 2012 my immediate manager was a Texas Rangers.  Centered on the front wall of his office and opposite his desk was the timeless portrait of Ryan giving the business to an unfortunate Robin Ventura.   Apparently there was disagreement on the high heat coming out of his right arm….
Always a shame that Ryan wasn’t gifted better team ownership or good franchise circumstances once he left the NY Mets; ok I guess the Astros had some years in the early to mid 80s after all.  But for Ryan….No Cy Young award,  but all them no hitters!
It’s a new age, and it’s filled with football (of the international variety).
Go check out an MLS game … Portland vs San Diego was absolutely electric last night.
Fans singing, smoke flying, drums drumming, banners waving, stands bouncing. 
It is it’s OWN culture, and it’s international. Black, white, brown … every nation in the world represented. 
It’s called “the beautiful game” for a reason, and the beauty extends beyond the pitch.
Maybe nobody’s talking about it because they can’t bear to admit that capitalism’s favorite team came out on top.   I do like the individual Dodger players, and Ohtani especially is a pleasure to watch.  And I do thank LA for taking a bunch of bunch of past their prime players with bloated contracts off the Red Sox’ hands several years ago.  But LA is second only to the hated Yankees for teams I actively root against.  It’s a team only PE C-suiters could love.  Must be nice to bring in a billion dollars worth of pitchers for the last few weeks of the regular season and the p(l)ayoffs.   Not every team has that luxury.  Any mention of the Dodgers at NC should go under the guillotine watch.
I dunno, fell under the spell of Dodger Stadium-the only 1960’s NL baseball stadium still left standing-and unlike most of the other 60’s efforts in that regard, didn’t have the awful dual MLB/NFL thing going on.
Haven’t been to a game there this century, so i’m a little rusty-but oh the memories they linger pleasantly enough.
From what i’ve seen on tv, the aged edifice looks to have more advertising than I remember seeing, but I’m from the era when trying to make money on such things was considered crass-so it was scant. 
The only indication @ Dodger Stadium was a big Union 76 orange ball on top of a pillar, so clean.
Watched a NHL game from the 70’s awhile back and the boards are bereft of branding, naked as it were-they almost looked whitewashed in fact.

“China’s Shenzhou 21 docks with space station, sets the country’s own speed record”
The Chinese say that they intend to land a taikonaut on the Moon by 2030 and going by this article, they are still on track. I can only imagine the panic in the Trump regime as the Chinese get closer and closer to their objective but it is not like they are doing anything about this goal themselves. There is no permanent head of NASA and the guy at SecTransport is acting head – while muttering about how NASA should be folded into the Department of Transport. And he has thrown contracts open again meaning that there is no clear set path to launch a Moon flight but competing corporations who probably have their own ideas how things should be done. But no doubt that Trump will stick to his demand that there be an American on the Moon before the end of his term. It’s a good thing that JFK never said that but only that it be before the end of the decade.
“‘The money machine is misfiring’: City blames Brexit for UK’s £20bn productivity headache”
What does “productivity” even mean when applied to a parasitic rent-seeking sector?
The article actually addresses this but then turns away. One cannot stare into the sun!
Of talks about how the historic UK productivity figures were driven by the productivity of the City and it has now cratered and brought the productivity figures down with it. I would like to see an analysis but I wonder if the current low measured productivity is actually any lower than before in many sectors (services), when finance is stripped out. 
The real new productivity crisis in the UK is in manufacturing as a result of higher energy and commodity costs because of war on Russia. And possibly the explosion of low wage jobs using the boom in legal economic migration (and the no wage jobs using illegal migrants).

In a nutshell…, lol.
I’m pretty thankful for the dog and catpile these nights. The fur-ball foursome got btus to spare.
yeah…before it was just Osa the dog, and Bob the Cat(who has always been kind of a dick)…but the 3 juvenile cats that were friendly to me at the bar…i brought them into the house while i went on my catmurder spree.
and they have become fixtures…much more cuddly than Bob ever was(he hates them,lol)so i have Bob behind my head in the pillownest, Osa along my right thigh, and 3 little cats piled up on my legs.
makes it hard to get up for coffee in the am.
or to tend the woodstoves, etc.
but they are a welcome source of heat…and pretty good company, so far…galloping alongside me back and forth as i go about my doins.
theyve also apparently inspired Osa to follow me around more.
she likes them, wants to play, etc…but they’re wary,lol.
and this sorta cold am(for me,lol-, was the first time she didnt growl when one of them slipped off my legs and nuzzled against her.
still…a warm woman would be preferable…
Scientists just shattered a major exercise myth ScienceDaily
Scientists just discovered something that runners and cyclists knew all along. Even amateurs know that measuring pulse after waking up is how one can gauge change over time, and that it gets lower as you get in shape.
These results challenge a long-held belief, once repeated by US President Donald Trump, that the human body is like a battery with a limited energy supply and that exercise only depletes it.
LOL, Trump science.
Believe it or not, that was the first guy on the Moon’s thoughts, too.
I believe that every human has a finite number of heartbeats… and I don’t intend to waste any of mine.
Neil Armstrong
That’s why he took one small step in stead of one giant leap.
Another example of why someone being an expert in one thing does not translate to them knowing jack about anything else. Yet, for some reason there’s no end to the various celebrities opining on important topics, tech oligarchs getting the grubby mits on everything, and me here in the comments sharing my opinion on stuff I clearly know nothing about.
…got the extended warranty on heartbeats 
100 billion, or 100 years-whatever comes first.
And here I’ve been thinking I only had a set number of heart beats allowed per day and exceeding that number would be instant death. Guess I no longer have that excuse to not exercise!
Why Do Spiders Decorate Their Webs? A New Piece of the Puzzle Nautilus

I work in this area and this is my experience. Large companies (and some not so large) are extremely paranoid about allowing the AI companies to use their vital information for training. The major AI players all sell private instances where users are assured that no one outside of their company can use their data for training or analyze the custom models. They put language in contracts and audits are conducted by 3rd parties to verify these claims. Its above my pay grade to determine what they are really doing behind the scenes, but given the way the contracts are written it would be a major scandal if they ever got caught cheating.
A big worry to many is the user sending private information to the models running in public instances which do not have these guarantees. My employer blocks these sites, and we’re all told to use the private version.
A second worry that is coming on strong is the use of Chinese models like DeepSeek and Qwen (even privately maintained versions using open source) . More companies are adopting policies where these are forbidden because, I assume, the Chinese cannot be trusted. One company described it as “geopolitical models are forbidden”.
Re: Scientists just shattered a major exercise myth
This is not new. back in the 70’s a friend gave me the “using up extra heartbeats” thing and I pointed out that:
3 mile run at 160 beats per min 160*20 = 3200 beats
warm up cool down and other activity  120 beats per min 120*40 = 4800 beats
resting pulse 50 for the rest of the day 23*60*50 = 69000 beats
total 3200 + 4800 +69000 = 77000 beats per day
him resting pulse 72*24*60 = 103689 beats per day
(this assumes that during every day activity, his pulse is the same amount above resting pulse as mine)
he started taking the stairs
yeah this is some seriously auld news.
It’s good to get it out there anyway as lots of the kids these days are all weights and no cardio.
All weights and no cardio is also auld news, and no legs day too.

Students in China are encouraged to rest and nap during school.’
If those kids are doing a 12 hour day, then this is a vital necessity. I really like the way those desks converted into beds and they could teach the airlines a few tricks. You can see that there are multiple models here in use. And after those kids have their nap, they are ready to absorb more lessons. Of course if you read the replies to this tweet, you will find many sour grapes-
https://xcancel.com/Rainmaker1973/status/1983685284827918711
I particularly liked the cabinets that had a whole bed hidden inside!! I could see a big market and lot of people making use of them. Homeless facilities, detention centers, airbnbs, Americans just trying to survive they’re inequality…
Also, how is the United States education system going to compete with China? 12 hours of instruction a day! (Minus naps)
I think car makers might be wise to incorporate some of the design implemented in the Chinese school desks to enable cars to become mobile homes … of a sort. Even dead cars could provide a home for the growing hordes of homeless. 
I have mixed feelings about 12 hours per day of instruction for school children. I learned the most from my own studies after I came home from school and from the time I spent at the public library and in my room attempting to write the most convincing essay I could for a homework assignment. Once I reached an age of double digits, I estimate that many, though not all days, I may have spent more than 12 hours per day studying when I add my study at home with the time spent in the classroom. I also greatly value the time I spent learning to play a musical instrument, or wandering in nature and in museums or attending the Summer Shakespeare plays and orchestral concerts my parents brought me and my siblings to. I believe schools and parents should foster a love for learning, endless curiosity, imagination, and questioning the ‘right answer’ in a way I did not see or sense in the schooling of my own children. As u.s. school are constituted, a 12 hour school day would bring the death of learning and those attributes I value.
Son #1 is currently at a school where a 12h day is possible, if he went in for breakfast (07:30) and stayed for dinner (18:00) and left when the boarders do their prep (19:30ish). As it is, an 8.5h day is standard (08:45-17:15). 
He often goes in early for breakfast because it is a full English (sausages and bacon, hash browns, black pudding, eggs etc) but only stays late to play DnD!
He also has Saturday school….
“Son #1” sounds like a name Musk would give to one of his kids. :)

AI Blamed for Tens of Thousands of White Collar Layoffs –  Futurism
There should be a case study about that headline as being indicative of a larger problem.
The real headline, more descriptive of the contents of the article and the reality (and also very catchy) is buried at the last paragraph:
“AI is a flashy scapegoat for mounting white collar layoffs.”
I drove by a ‘natural’ park in an arroyo yesterday, with pretty steep terrain, and a driverless mower on a two-track hydrostatic system was being driven by a parks worker with a R/C joystick gizmo, a dozen or so parks workers in sweatshirt uniforms watching.  I circled back, got some pics, talked with El Jefe for a couple minutes. Asked him how soon he would plot waypoints via GPS, and have a computer driving it from an office with the lights off, the mower automatically re-docking to recharge batteries, and how many fewer staff he would have?
He opined there was always weed-whacking to be done, doubted any man-power cuts.
I was not in accord, but hey.  Also asked him why they were mowing native bunch-grasses— wasn’t the point to be maintenance free and natural? 
I also suggested he get some bumper stickers printed up: “Support Universal Basic Income”.
He was skeptical that Elroy, Jeff, Bill, Sergei would be delighted to start paying taxes to keep humans fed, clothed, warm, dry, and educated, with access to health care and clean potable water.  
Oh well.
Who’s going to the park that the time and money will still be spent maintaining?
a parks worker, or a forward deployed engineer?
And if “natural”or “wildlife” was ever really the goal for the area, all machines would need to be removed as well.
“Desperate Special Forces Bid to Save Pokrovsk Fails as AFU Faces Unprecedented Collapse on Every Front”
I have no idea what good the Ukrainians thought that 11 special forces soldiers would do dropped near Pokrovsk. They were quickly wiped out so the whole thing was just a suicide mission. Seems that DC is going to have to get ready for several Ukrainian fortified cities to fall, one after another. I’m sure that Trump will demand an immediate ceasefire and to freeze this war on the contact line and if Russia does not agree, he will do something. But I bet that there will be an element of panic in the air when this happens, not only in DC but also in Brussels.
A F U  Hmmmm.  Irony or paradox?
A F U.  Irony or Paradox?
The fog of war keeps getting thicker. Who knows what their goal was? Extraction? Protecting key assets? A coked out plan to have commandos raid behind enemy lines and save the day? A drowning person will grab on to anything they can in their desperation. I have no idea how the peace will eventually be shaped but the dimensions of the coming AFU collapse are becoming increasingly clear despite the fog. The AFU will be completely destroyed and any patriotic fighters left standing will join terror groups to make strikes throughout the world.
The best guess I’ve read so far is that they were supposed to reach the “sculpted” Pokrovsk city sign at the western entrance to the city, as the helicopter landed less than half a mile away and five of them were killed within a few hundred yards of it. 
Had they reached it, they could have raised an Ukrainian flag there, take some photos and skedaddle to Dnipro with “solid proof” that Pokrovsk is like totally back under Ukrainian control.
It would fit in with the previous high-risk, showy gimmicks Ukrainians tend to do to win the war in social media, but which have little if any effect on the war itself.
Perhaps their intent was to surrender with the rest of the guys. That would sure be my goal.

Does it matter if US were to send Tomahawks?
Nope.
It´s mainly political.
The real danger of course being how would the Russians react.
Although, and I tend to agree, they would act only against targets on Ukrainian territory.
Why risk more if the military fallout of Tomahawks would be really limited.
Of course if the US wants to start WWIII. They can do that. 
But the fact that someone at Pentagon – allegedly – greenl-lit it now – doesn´t mean more than just that.
Factions vs. factions. Provocation for sake of it due to lack of means and strategy.
Russians are well aware of this.

AI Blamed for Tens of Thousands of White Collar Layoffs – Futurism
(“AI is a flashy scapegoat for mounting white collar layoffs.” As summed up in the actual article.)
I have a crazy notion and, if needed, talk me down.
If they can get back to ridicuously easy money policy, they are going to credit “AI” with “productivity gains”.
The U.S.  joint staff aka pentagon said there are enough tomahawks to send some to Zelenski.
Russian staff gets CNN feeds too!
 What was not said:  Japan wants 400 for their missile destroyers, there not being much carrier in missile defense.
Also, how to hit anything if U.S. does not provide top secret special access targeting and navigation aids.
Those spunky Kievan contracts can get all the engineering specs to do what U.S. wants with tomahawks.
Maybe shoot them off MiG 27’s.
Are they karting in a ship to launch them from?
A 50-foot sailing yacht named Andromeda.
Of course!
So efficient!
From what I’ve seen, there are two batteries in the Army inventory.  I assume one of these would be sent in theater.   The launcher is housed in a 40-ft container, so an inviting target.  I suppose you could park these in the far west by the Poland border to make it a more difficult counter-battery target.
Targeting depends on the actual target and desired effect.  If it’s a V-1-style terror effect, I suppose it’s possible that inertial nav all the way might be feasible.  I would assume GPS denial is something Russia would pursue, at least near high-value targets.  Tomahawk can have some onboard nav sensors that would be difficult to block, but depend on prior intel data, which I assume probably exists for any interesting targets.
Enroute planning is based the missile RCS (detectability) and low-level flight to take advantage of terrain masking.  Again you need intel of the anti-air defense capability.  I don’t know, but assume these days actual terrain elevation data is sufficiently available and easily disseminated to shooters that that is no longer a limiting factor.
While I suppose “black” programs could be postulated to exist, I continue to doubt the idea that a nuclear warhead option is available for any current missile or launcher.

Trump’s Retribution Campaign Leaves D.C. Prosecutor’s Office in Crisis (NY Times via archive.ph)
America is a banana republic
Under the vaulted arches of the National Union Building, a group of federal prosecutors gathered recently for what has become an all-too-common ritual: saying goodbye to colleagues.
The speeches that night reflected the despondent mood inside the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington, as the lawyers who were quitting urged those staying behind to forge ahead in uncertain times. Do what’s right, they said. Speak truth to power. Uphold the rule of law.
But as the hour grew later — and the bar tab bigger — the politics that have buffeted the office for months suddenly intruded on the evening, people who were there recounted later. In a quiet corner, away from the charcuterie and veggie dip, Jonathan Hornok, a top aide to Jeanine Pirro, the Trump appointee picked to run the office, was firing Jon Hooks, a senior prosecutor who had worked there for nearly 20 years.
That a respected supervisor with a long career could be stripped of his job in the middle of a farewell party for his colleagues captured something of the Darwinian tumult that has wracked the prosecutors’ office since President Trump returned to the White House and set about remaking the Justice Department in his image.
Bad Jonathan!
RE DHS Wants States to Hand Over Driver’s License Data for Citizenship Checks
It’s amusing that a kind of national database of Americans, once anathema to conservatives, is being implemented by the Trump administration under the dubious pretense of stopping “voter fraud”.
Literally there it is
The Department of Homeland Security says it intends to add state driver’s license information to a swiftly expanding federal system envisioned as a one-stop shop for checking citizenship.
I imagine Republicans in Congress will pass a bill to outlaw this or conduct investigations any time now…
That’s what the state ‘Real ID drivers license’ program is all about.  It’s also the prelude to the rollout of official digital IDs.
Note: you do not have to have a Real ID drivers license to drive, or even to fly.

if only the people didnt have goldfish memory,lol
my immediate recollection upon reading that was a few years ago in Texas….the texgop has long insisted thay they are all about Homerule…as in no intruding big gubmit from above, meddling in local communities.
until a few texas cities voted to ban fracking…or to not support the border patrol…or whatever.
then, Austin had to Step in and force them to toe the line.
at the time, i wrote a furious email to all the texgop creatures, including the lite guv, Radio Preacher, calling them out for utter hypocrisy.
that was also the last time i wrote a letter to the editor to the local paper/brochure.
(it was well received)
of course, the dems are no better.
all is contingent and transactional…except that it all must serve the already rich and powerful.

i look up ere i sit down, now.
but to your point…it was always gonna come home.
down at the bottom where ive lived for most of my life, that was frelling obvious…and has been ongoing…at first, under the aegis of the War on Drugs.

The New Kirx Klan Maga base will not tolerate a Brown Hindu Indian first lady.    So Vance needs to get a new wife more to the New Kirx Klan’s MAGA-base’s liking.

thats sad as hell,lol.
i know nothing about her, but i am an agnostic mystic druidy person, and my wife was catholic…and i supported our boys doing the catholic thing(imagine me in church…after her funeral mass, at the reception/dinner thing in the parish hall(overflow crowds), the Father pointedly sat by me, and we talked about Pseudodionysius,lol…because i am “not contained between my hat and my boots”…i told him that every priest needs a druid friend, and he agreed(!), but hasnt taken me up on it)
so i understand multifaith marriage, and how much tolerance and forbearance it takes.
thats the sort of example this country needs…and it would be doubly sad to see him cast that away…along with her and their kids…for some short term political calculation.
The problem with that theory:
Anyone that rabid about interracial marriage would likely not be excited about baby daddy to mixed kids.
He can’t divorce the kids.
I don’t know if the video talks about that. Don’t really want to watch it.
Tabitha is pointing out that J D ” Despicable Little Tatoo” Vance is entirely soul-less, pragmatic and beneath ethics and morality.    She therefor predicts that he will divorce his current wife and even try marrying the Widow Kirk if he can.     It may not convince GroyperMAGA because of the mixed kids.
But Vance will give it a good hard try.
   The test of a theory is in the coming-true or not of its predictions.    If Vance divorces Suha then Tabitha’s theory is pretty good.    If he then goes on to marry the Widow Kirk, then her theory is VERY good.
Assuming Vance and his wife had a Catholic wedding, Vance would need to have the marriage annulled.  Which can be done, but it is complicated.
he is not married to his current wife “through the Catholic Church”.
i state that categorically, because Tam and I tried, hard…but i would not lie.lol
the part of the Catholic Church apparatus that deals with that, to my surprise, is what used to be called the Office of the Inquisition(yeah, that one,lol)…called something else more anodyne, now, that i dont remember.
and they are hard core with their check boxes.
i was babtise Lutheran, against my will, that wasnt even formed yet,lol…but that part was ok(i was an Xtian, in their eyes)…but i wouldnt submit to professions of Faith…which meant a hard NO!.
theres no way in hell that Vance and his Hindu wife were married “through the church”.
the Catholic government(what it is) takes their rules seriously.
that Priest…Father Melvin…was a nice guy, and he meant well..a kind man, altogether.
but he was a clerk…checking off boxes…not a spiritual leader.
i found him kind and nice, but boring,lol.
his successor out here, Father Red…young guy, inquisitive, well read…is much more inspiring…but also more strict when it comes to the Forms…ie: when he heard her last confession, and administered the Last rights, i had to leave the room…because i wasnt a Catholic.
and she wanted me there.
bt all that was between her and god, and i was damned to hell, and all.
so i wasnt allowed in the temporarily Holy Space.
lest i pollute it with my heathenism.
Who knows. Maybe he will get ICE Barbie to put bounties on the children.
Regarding the Tesla robotaxi numbers Elon is spouting this line in the article stood out:
“Considering that there are only two months left in the fourth quarter of 2025, Tesla’s Robotaxi team will likely be extremely busy during the next eight weeks.”
Curious, I looked up how many are currently in the road: There are ZERO on the road in the Bay Area. https://electrek.co/2025/10/22/tesla-is-trying-to-deceive-investors-into-thinking-it-has-san-francisco-robotaxis/
From 0 to 1,000 in eight weeks? Sounds like another one of Elon’s fanciful predictions.
Also, according to that article they don’t have a California license for autonomous vehicles but the law isn’t a concern for Elon so doubt that is a concern.
A.I. Is Making Death Threats Way More Realistic (NY Times via archive.ph)
Even though she was toughened by years spent working in internet activism, Caitlin Roper found herself traumatized by the online threats she received this year.
There was the picture of herself hanging from a noose, dead. And another of herself ablaze, screaming.
The posts were part of a surge of vitriol directed at Ms. Roper and her colleagues at Collective Shout, an Australian activist group, on X and other social media platforms. Some of it, including images of the women flayed, decapitated or fed into a wood chipper, was seemingly enabled — and given a visceral realism — by generative artificial intelligence. In some of the images, Ms. Roper was wearing a blue floral dress that she does, in fact, own.
This year is lit.
Trump really is the perfect embodiment of our elite; petty, corrupt, self serving, careless, and entirely focused on immediate gratification. He’s the perfect symbol of a failing state, an empire in terminal decline, entirely unaware even of the limits of power or concerned with the outcomes of its exercise.
Well put.
I might hazard to add that the corruption is consuming everything and everyone around him.  We’re down to M T-G and Massie on the GOP side as the only pols left with anything resembling a soul.
Even Rand Paul has become a petty, corrupt little tyrant.  He was blathering on about raising the Social Security retirement age to 70 the other day – as if there aren’t a gazillion other real issues out there.  I guess kicking old people when they’re down is easier than taking on the MIC, endless wars, genocide, and economic insanity … remember when Rand Paul actually stood up against someone more powerful than him?  Remember when his Dad fought to audit the Fed? It’s all a memory now.

Senior Contributor.
Liang Zaizhong, the son of China manufacturing billionaire Liang Wengen, resigned as chairman of Sany Heavy Equipment International effective yesterday, the Hong Kong-listed company said in an announcement on Friday. 
Sany Heavy Equipment International, whose products include port equipment, named Zhou Fugui, a long-time Sany Group executive, as new chairman. Sany Heavy Equipment International also said Qi Jian would step down from roles as vice chairman Qi Jian and executive director “to enhance the company’s corporate governance structure and strengthen the rotation mechanism of the strategic leadership team.” Qi will remain CEO; Liang Zaizhong will stay on as an executive director.   
The changes at the top come after Sany Heavy Equipment International’s shares gained more than 45% in the past 12 months; the company said on Oct. 30 net profit rose by 16% from a year earlier to 414 million yuan in the three months to September. 
Liang Wengen, 68, is the founder and former chairman of Shanghai- and Hong Kong-listed Sany Heavy Industry, a construction equipment maker which has thrived over the years from China’s building and infrastructure boom.   China’s richest man in 2011, Liang Wengen currently holds a fortune worth $8.8 billion, according to the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires list.  Son Liang Zaizong, 40, holds a bachelor’s degree in computer and management sciences from the University of Warwick. He received a master’s degree in public administration from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in May 2014. Both father and son are board members at Sany Heavy Industry. 
Sany Heavy Industry just last week sold $1.7 billion of “H shares” that began trading at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Oct. 28 at HK$21.30; they closed at HK$23.38 on Friday.   Sany Heavy Industry’s Shanghai-traded shares, known as “A shares,” have gained 21% in the past 12 months.  The Changsha-headquartered company, a global competitor of Caterpillar and Deere, said on Thursday net profit in the three months to September rose by 48% to 1.9 billion yuan, on revenue that increased 10.7% to 21.2 billion yuan. 
Sany Heavy Industry is among a group of Chinese companies trading at mainland exchanges to successfully seek an additional listing at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange this year, making the bourse exchange one of the world’s most important for new offerings this year. Others include Contemporary Amperex Technology, better known as CATL, and Zhejiang Sanhua Intelligent Controls.  Cornerstone investors in Sany Heavy Industry’s H share offering included Temasek, BlackRock, Infore Capital, Hillhouse and UBS Asset Management
Sany’s history traces to China’s central Hunan province in 1989 as a small welding materials factory.  Other Sany-connected billionaires include Xiang Wenbo ($1.4 billion), Mao Zhongwu ($1.3 billion) and Tang Xiuguo ($1.4 billion). 
Sany America, Sany Heavy Industry’s main U.S. operation, is headquartered in Peachtree City, Georgia. 
Pioneering Chinese Glass Billionaire Resigns As Fuyao Glass Chairman
 "
38,2025-11-02,"AMD is expanding its processor portfolio beyond the x86 architecture with its first ARM-based APU, internally known as “Sound Wave.” The chip’s existence was uncovered through customs import records, confirming several details about its design and purpose. Built with a BGA-1074 package measuring 32 mm × 27 mm, the processor fits within standard mobile SoC dimensions, making it suitable for thin and light computing platforms. It employs a 0.8 mm pitch and FF5 interface, replacing the FF3 socket previously used in Valve’s Steam handheld devices, further hinting at a new generation of compact AMD-powered hardware.
It only makes sense for AMD to enter the market for ARM SoCs, as it’s a whole section of the processor market they’re not tapping into. Even if they don’t manage to compete with the best ARM processors out there, they can still serve the mid and lower end just fine.

Follow me on Mastodon @[email protected]
And it looks like American companies are leaving the entire RISV-C field to Chinese ones.
Yes, ARM is great, and currently offers the best power efficiency as an ISA without compromising performance. However it is still a closed system. (More closed to than x86, ironically)
While, StarFive, SiFive, and others are producing SoCs used by Banana, or Milk to produce mini (Raspberry Pi form factor) or desktop (mini-ITX) sized boards.
Sorry for jumping in like this, but my first thought was “this is great, but where is more diversity?”

LeFantome,
Thanks, I did not know about them. It is nice to have some domestic interest.
But apparently there are no current boards we can try, and Chinese manufacturers are leading the way to adopt them 🙂

sukru,
Diversity has never been the point, I believe. Money is. I believe that RISC-V is kept open just because there’s the only way newcomers (Chinese ones mostly) can make money and can leap forward uncumbered by patents and licensing, which is important if they ever aim to seriously compete outside the Chinese domestic market.
We’ve had diversity in the past. At home, I have 2x PA-RISC machines, 2x PowerPC machines, 3 ARM devices operating like a normal computer (running Linux, doing compuntery stuff rather than phone stuff), a MIPS machine, a few amd64 machines. And yet? Now the “serious” market is reduced to amd64 and ARM. It just stopped becoming economically feasible to keep maintaining multiple architectures when performance started being dependent much more on manufacturing process rather than how smart your ISA is.
I find it really hard to see super awesome competitive RISC-V devices unless there’s a strong market incentive for anyone to put RISC-V devices of serious performance and the big industrly players to then start porting money-making software for it.
I’m here for it. The less dependent the world is on Intel and Qualcomm in this space, the better off we all are. I’m honestly surprised AMD waited this long to enter the field.
Competing with Qualcomm, Samsung and now Apple ain’t easy feat. AMD had first to defeat first on the x86 ground before exploring new horizons and fight new quests. On the GPU side though, Nvidia is still strong opponent.
Qualcomm and MediaTek are probably the two real competitors.
I haven’t seen a Samsung Exynos design around in a while (US), which is surprising. I thought they would be a big Arm player by now in the SBC and desktop spaces.
Apple is Apple. They aren’t selling their procs to others, and AMD isn’t selling their procs to Apple.
AMD isn’t taking out Nvidia, but they do have valuable graphics tech in the IoT space. Nvidia seems to be leaving that space, or at least they don’t feel the need to update Tegra.
Will it boot mainline Linux? I’m getting tired of closed systems.
Much higher chance of having linux support coming from AMD, this isn’t because AMD is inherently more altruistic than Qualcomm or Apple, but because the graphics portion is RDNA 3.5 which already has Linux support. I can see AMD having some strong push for Linux support to be able to sell this in Steamdeck type devices to expand the market viability.
Indeed. AMD has a better corporate culture around upstreaming support for their chips.
Apple doesn’t have to think about anyone aside from Apple, and Qualcomm hates their customers.
Does it? AMD is nowadays dominant in the x86 market, which will be around for quite a while, even as WoA becomes more popular and mainstream (In particular, servers are still big – ARM servers only make sense in hyperscale right now. As is gaming.). In the ARM market, they’d be competing against several companies, like Nvidia, Qualcomm, Mediatek, etc. who have carved out various niches and market segments to themselves. The Radeon IP isn’t much a useful differentiator there, as Samsung is proving.
@DefineDecision
> the x86 market, which will be around for quite a while
Agreed
> ARM servers only make sense in hyperscale right now. As is gaming
I must misunderstand you. ARM is so compelling that all the cloud companies are making their own ARM silicon. AWS says that 90% of their EC2 (virtual machine) customers use Graviton (AWS ARM silicon).
For this in-house projects, I think that RISC-V makes even more sense and we should start to see that over the next 12-24 months.
But for AMD, who has to sell to customers, ARM makes the most sense right now.
LeFantome,
Yes, many ARM cores are not directly accessible to end users, but are ubiquitous everywhere. Not only cloud, every smart devices, switches, Internet infrastructure, and many other “below surface” places use ARM.
Still… yes, RISC-V would offer more benefits, especially when ARM ownership itself is still not fully decided. (Did SoftBank finally find a buyer)?
“Sound Wave” is manufactured on TSMC’s 3 nm node and aims for a 5 W to 10 W TDP range, positioning it directly against Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite. The chip is expected to power future Microsoft Surface products scheduled for release in 2026.
The 5-10W range is where AMD currently isn’t very strong. The Intel N150, N250, and, lesser, N355 kind of run this segment. This could be a pretty good fit if AMD is going to use the off the shelf Arm cores then add their graphics, network, and special sauce.
I’m also curious to know if MS is blaming Qualcomm for the failure of Windows Arm, which is probably fair.
With industry interest in efficient, ARM-based computing accelerating, “Sound Wave” could help AMD diversify its portfolio while leveraging its strengths in graphics and AI acceleration. If reports are accurate, the processor will enter production in late 2025, with commercial devices expected the following year.
It’s late 2025. This was probably something they were playing around with. Maybe for a game console, like the Xbox, but this sounds like an experiment. AMD has had an Arm license for a while, and they have been shipping Arm cores for their security processor.
It wold be neat to see, especially if AMD upstreams it’s Arm offering like its x86 offerings. People are kind of annoyed about how little support the current Arm vendors offer, and Arm needs better vendor support if it wants to make solid gains against x86. Support in a major distro like Debian or Fedora on day of launch would be a solid reason to pick these chips.

During my visit to Samsung’s home appliance R&D facility in Seoul, Jay Yoon, Corporate VP and Head of the Refrigerator R&D Group, explained something remarkable about the development of their AI Hybrid Cooling refrigerator. His team had completely redesigned the refrigerator’s internal layout mid-development, not to fix a problem, but to maximize consumer benefits. The Peltier cooling chip system worked perfectly in its original rear-mounted position. The engineering was sound. But through continued collaboration between Samsung Research and the product development team, they discovered that repositioning the entire cooling system to the top would dramatically improve interior space and thermal performance. “We completely discarded the layout we initially designed,” Yoon explained, describing how the team abandoned months of engineering work to pursue the better solution.
Designer: Samsung
The team wasn’t fixing a problem. They were refusing to settle for “good enough.”






That willingness to abandon comfortable solutions appeared throughout the two-day facility tour. Over presentations, lab tours, and design team sessions, I watched Samsung wrestle with fundamental challenges about how appliances should integrate into modern homes and how global products can feel locally relevant.
Samsung’s design evolution over the past decade reflects a broader shift in how we think about appliances in our homes. The design team traced this progression explicitly during their presentation. “In the past, Samsung refrigerators featured bold contours and glamorous presence that stood out in kitchen spaces,” explained the design team during their presentation. These were appliances that demanded attention, with dramatic lines and high-contrast finishes that made them focal points in any kitchen. The design language spoke loudly: this is premium technology, and you should notice it.

Today, that approach has inverted.
“Today, our designs focus on a flat and geometric look that blends seamlessly with modern interiors,” the design team explained. The Bespoke line exemplifies this shift, offering customizable panels that let consumers match their appliances to their specific aesthetic rather than forcing rooms to adapt to the appliance. As the presentation emphasized, “The Bespoke was the first product tailored to the consumer, rather than led by the manufacturer.”
The evolution makes sense when you consider how kitchens function now. Open floor plans mean appliances sit in continuous sightlines with living spaces. Minimalist interior design emphasizes clean surfaces and reduced visual noise. An appliance that demands attention disrupts the careful balance homeowners work to create. Samsung’s current design language acknowledges this reality, focusing on integration rather than statements.
This shift required the design team to develop new methods for creating visual interest without resorting to dramatic forms. They’ve focused on proportion, material quality, and subtle details. During the product showcase, a designer pointed out their signature element: “This very narrow window is Samsung’s signature design identity.”
Samsung’s design team walked through their development methodology, which operates in three distinct phases. Understanding this structure reveals how they balance innovation with manufacturability, and why certain design decisions take precedence over others.
Advanced Design comes first. “The first stage, called advanced design, is the very early phase where we explore innovative design directions and develop concepts,” explained the design team. “In this stage, rather than focusing on manufacturability, we aim to discover new opportunities through future-oriented challenges.” The team researches global megatrends, tracks generational differences in appliance expectations, and studies post-pandemic changes in home behavior. This phase feeds the innovation pipeline with ideas that might become products in three to five years.
Archetype Design follows. “The second stage is Archetype Design, where we define the core design elements and identities and create prototypes that closely resemble our actual designs,” the team explained. Engineering constraints enter the conversation. Manufacturing realities impose boundaries. Cost structures become factors. The Peltier chip repositioning happened during this phase, when the team realized their initial layout compromised the consumer benefits they were trying to deliver.






Final Design brings everything to market-ready form. “The final phase, where we refine the archetype design into a market-ready form, taking into account feasibility and optimization,” as the presentation described it. The design gets refined for production efficiency, tested for durability, validated through consumer preference studies, and engineered for serviceability. The team emphasized that this isn’t where creativity dies. It’s where creative solutions prove whether they can survive contact with reality.
Some ideas make it through with minimal changes. Others, like the refrigerator layout, require fundamental reimagining even at this late stage.
What struck me about this process is how much research grounds every stage. The team doesn’t rely on designer intuition alone. They conduct extensive consumer preference studies to evaluate design competitiveness. They analyze furniture design trends to ensure their appliances harmonize with what consumers are actually buying for their homes. They run localized projects like their U.S. Laundry Space and Market Trend Sensing study to understand regional differences in how people interact with appliances. Design decisions emerge from this research foundation rather than aesthetic preference alone.
The washing machine design team introduced their Unibody Express philosophy as a case study in essentialist thinking. The name itself signals the approach: eliminate everything unnecessary until only the fundamental interaction remains.

Their starting point was provocative. Rather than beginning with a washing machine shape and refining it, they asked what the essential form should be. As Sarah Choi, Head of the Living Design Group, explained during the presentation: “We’ve gone back to basics to redefine design and to make people’s lives better. With the design philosophy of Samsung that is essential, innovative, harmonious.” She described stripping away everything extraneous to reach the core: “But rather something fundamental and pure. A single rectangle. This is the essential space where we meet our users.” The presentation showed how they removed decorative elements systematically. “We removed many decorative elements that make up the washing machine. Focused on the fundamental material, the steel.”
What remained was steel, glass, and the pure geometry of the rectangle.
This sounds simple. Executing it proved complex. Removing decorative elements means the fundamental materials and proportions carry all the aesthetic weight. There’s nowhere to hide manufacturing imperfections or component compromises. The team explained they needed higher standards than previous designs required. The steel finish, glass clarity, and panel alignments all had to be essentially perfect since there was nothing else to draw the eye. As the team explained, “This design form allows for effective management of product design variations while enabling efficient operations through part standardization.”

The result aligns with broader movements in industrial design toward essential forms and honest materials. But unlike some minimalist exercises that prioritize aesthetic purity over function, the Unibody Express philosophy emerged from user research. The team studied how people actually interact with washing machines, identified the core interaction space, and designed around that fundamental relationship.
The minimalism isn’t stylistic. It’s structural, based on understanding what matters to someone doing laundry.
Color, Material, and Finish design operates as its own discipline within Samsung’s structure, and watching their CMF team present revealed how much invisible work creates the perception of quality in appliances.
The team expressed particular pride in their black metal work. During the CMF showcase, a designer explained: “Real metal is used by all companies, but we are proud of black metal and have been leading trends in this finish.” Their newest premium direction uses ribbed aluminum. “This is a new material that has not been used much in product design. Aluminum that was used a lot in IT devices,” Oh noted, describing how they applied a ribbed design to create a premium aesthetic for refrigerators in the Korean market.

Glass appears across product categories, from cooking appliances to refrigerators to water purifiers, with the team developing methods to match colors and textures across these different applications. The upcoming ceramic collaboration represents their most ambitious material innovation. During the showcase of unreleased products, Oh explained: “This is ceramic from Italian company Mutina. Ceramic is widely used in furniture and table interiors, but we have applied ceramic CMF to refrigerators for the first time with the technology to apply it to product design.”
What makes CMF design fascinating is how it operates at the intersection of aesthetics and material science. “We continue to study interior design trends across diverse regions, from Asia to the Americas and Europe, through online learning,” explained Oh. “By updating and analyzing the latest trends, we ensure that our home appliances harmonize seamlessly with consumers’ real-life environments.” They create digital twin virtual spaces to simulate how their CMF choices will appear in these real-world contexts. “The CMF combines these elements into two tones, bright and dark, that complement each unique space and its character,” the presentation emphasized.
The team also experiments with perception engineering. “We have the skill to create textures and printing technology that can give a stone feel,” Oh explained during the showcase, demonstrating samples that used glass and coating techniques to simulate stone and ceramic aesthetics without the weight and cost constraints of actual stone or ceramic components.
During the CMF showcase, Oh explained her team’s philosophy of holistic interior integration: “We don’t design products in isolation. We design them to harmonize with furniture, interiors, and fabrics to complete the overall interior mood using these paints and materials.”
The sustainability integration revealed during the CMF presentation felt refreshingly pragmatic rather than performative.
“All glass samples are made of recycled materials,” Oh explained during the CMF showcase. “Samsung has been working to replace glass products with recycled glass for several years now.” For their premium aluminum products, they’ve adopted a hybrid approach: “The front uses a thin new aluminum layer that can reflect new colors because it needs to express beauty,” while “the base metal behind uses recycled aluminum.” The team was frank about sustainability constraints. When asked about expanding recycled content further, they acknowledged: “It would be most efficient to make suggestions without increasing consumer prices… If there is a need that consumers can tolerate to that extent, we can do it.”
The most compelling design challenge Samsung faces is creating global products that feel locally appropriate. Refrigerator design makes this visible.
The design team explained: “T-Type is a popular platform here in Asia, whereas the French door type is also preferred in North America.” They detailed the structural differences: “The T-type has segmented freezer box at the bottom, while the French door type uses large capacity freezer drawers, also located at the bottom.” The design presentation emphasized these aren’t arbitrary preferences. They reflect different food cultures, shopping patterns, and kitchen spatial organizations.

The design team explained that understanding these regional differences requires ethnographic research, not just market data. How do Korean families shop for and store kimchi? How do American households manage bulk purchases from warehouse stores? What food preservation expectations exist in European markets with smaller, more frequent shopping patterns? Design decisions about interior layout, drawer sizing, and temperature zone configurations all flow from understanding these cultural contexts.
This regional customization extends beyond refrigerators. Kitchen appliance dimensions differ between markets. During the product showcase, Claire Lee, Head of Kitchen Design Group, explained: “This is a 30-inch wall oven… a product specialized for the North American market,” then showed a contrasting model: “Unlike the North American 30-inch model, this is a 24-inch spec model specialized for the European and Korean markets.” Cooking technology preferences vary too. Lee noted that in North America, “traditionally gas products were common,” but emphasized that “induction products are rapidly expanding” as consumers shift away from gas cooking.
Samsung designs platforms that can accommodate these variations while maintaining design language consistency across regions.
Samsung’s approach suggests appliance design is entering a more sophisticated phase. The days of technology-first thinking, where impressive specs drove product development and design followed, are giving way to human-centered processes where design insight drives technology application. The Peltier chip repositioning exemplifies this: the technology was ready, but the design team’s understanding of user benefit justified completely reworking the internal architecture.

This shift requires different skills from designers. They need fluency in material science, manufacturing constraints, cultural differences, and sustainability considerations alongside traditional aesthetic capabilities. They need research methodologies to validate assumptions about user preferences. They need collaborative skills to work with engineers who might resist mid-development redesigns.
The Samsung design team’s structure, with specialists in product design, CMF design, design innovation, and design strategy all collaborating, reflects this expanded scope.
The risk in this approach is designing for an idealized user rather than real people. The safety lies in the research foundation. Samsung’s investment in consumer preference studies, localized market sensing projects, and continuous trend analysis keeps their design process grounded in actual behavior rather than designer intuition about what people should want.
Watching their team work through these challenges over two days in Seoul revealed an organization taking appliance design seriously as a discipline. Not as styling applied to engineered products, but as a fundamental methodology for understanding how technology should integrate into daily life.
Whether this produces better appliances remains to be seen. But it definitely produces more thoughtfully considered ones.

40,2025-11-02,"Andrew Mountbatten Windsor arranged a private tour of Buckingham Palace while the late Queen was in residence, for businessmen from a cryptocurrency mining firm which agreed to pay his ex-wife up to £1.4m, the BBC can reveal.
Jay Bloom and his colleague Michael Evers were driven through the palace gates in the former prince's own car after being collected from their five-star Knightsbridge hotel for the visit in June 2019.
Their company, Pegasus Group Holdings, which Mr Bloom co-founded, employed Sarah Ferguson as a ""brand ambassador"" for a crypto-mining scheme which would lose investors millions when it failed less than a year later.
Mr Bloom, an entrepreneur who had previously set up a failed Mafia-themed museum in Las Vegas, and Mr Evers, a former actor, were met by a greeter and escorted inside the palace.
Mr Evers told the BBC they then met the Queen, although Mr Bloom disputed this.
Both Mr Evers and Mr Bloom were invited by the then-prince to his Pitch@Palace event - a Dragons' Den-style business pitching competition - at nearby St James's Palace later that day, and they dined that evening with Andrew, Ms Ferguson and their daughter Princess Beatrice.
Ms Ferguson was working with Pegasus Group Holdings at the time of the palace visit, while she was Duchess of York, to promote plans to use thousands of solar power generators to mine Bitcoin at a remote site in the Arizona desert.
But the project ultimately failed with only 615 of the planned 16,000 generators acquired and just $33,779 (about £25,000) in cryptocurrency mined.
In April 2021, some investors took legal action, claiming millions of dollars of investor funds were unaccounted for. A tribunal awarded the investors $4.1m, but Mr Bloom is seeking permission to appeal.
The revelations add to growing questions about how Andrew and his former wife have funded their lifestyle, as well as long-standing concerns about their business connections and that the then-prince may have used his royal titles and connections for private gain.
On Thursday evening, Buckingham Palace announced that it was starting the formal process of stripping Andrew of his royal titles and that he would be losing his Windsor mansion, following intense criticism of his links with the billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.
Andrew and Ms Ferguson did not respond to a detailed list of questions about their involvement with Mr Bloom and the crypto-mining venture.
Sarah Ferguson was paid more than £200,000 for her work for the company and a leaked contract reveals she was in line for a separate bonus worth £1.2m.
She also received a stake in the business, which proposed using solar generators to reduce the cost of the energy-intensive computer calculations needed to generate or ""mine"" the digital currency Bitcoin.
Her contract stipulated that she required first-class travel, five-star hotels and the services of a professional hairdresser and make-up artist for the maximum of four ""networking events"" she would attend on the company's behalf.
It said she did not ""hold herself out as an expert on the solar industry"" and therefore accepted no responsibility for ""industry-related information or commercial assessments"" used as the basis for her statements promoting the company.
Sarah Ferguson first met the Las Vegas businessman Jay Bloom in May 2018 when she was at a convention in the city to promote one of her children's books.
The pair struck up a friendship and business relationship.
Pegasus documents would subsequently describe her role as to ""engage with the company's clients, investors and strategic relationships"" as well as involvement with the company's planned ""philanthropic activities"".
For Mr Bloom, it was an introduction to royal circles which would lead to visits to Buckingham Palace and St James's Palace, a tour of Ms Ferguson and Andrew's home, the Royal Lodge in Windsor, and dinners with her and her family in at least four different countries.
Eight years before the duchess signed up to be a brand ambassador for Pegasus, Mr Bloom had hit the Las Vegas headlines, accused of missing payments and deceiving investors in connection with a ""mob experience"" exhibition in the city. Mr Bloom denied wrongdoing, fought investors' lawsuits and vowed to repay them.
He now had a new company, Pegasus, and ambitions to build a hotel and casino in Greece.
It was there in July 2018, while considering investing in the company, that Michael Evers, a former actor and reality TV star who had made money from cryptocurrency investments, first met Ms Ferguson.
The hotel and casino did not get built, but Mr Bloom had soon pivoted Pegasus to a new idea, one that was inspired by seeing a mobile solar power generator in use at the Las Vegas motor speedway in early 2019, according to filings in the later legal action brought by investors.
Mr Bloom and his co-founders hit upon a plan to use vast banks of these units to power a crypto-mining operation. The endeavour, the company estimated, would generate millions of dollars a month.
In March 2019, Ms Ferguson had dinner with Mr Bloom in Los Angeles. They had lunch at the Beverly Hills Hotel a few days later as she helped him try to close a deal for Pegasus. One of her daughters stopped by during the meal.
Mr Evers was now working for Pegasus as well as being an investor. He said he and Mr Bloom were regularly in London over the following months as they explored taking Pegasus public on the AIM market - part of the London Stock Exchange for growing companies.
He said he got to know Ms Ferguson and her family and ""through all that, I met Prince Andrew [and] Princess Beatrice and a lot of their family"" who he described as ""really great people, really friendly"".
""We were there once a month for a week to two weeks at a time and every time the relationships just kind of grew stronger and stronger and they started offering tours of different places, I guess like behind the scenes or I don't know what you'd call it,"" Mr Evers said. ""And just wanting to introduce us to more and more people.""
As well as a tour of the Royal Lodge, Andrew and his ex-wife arranged for the pair to visit Buckingham Palace on a day in June 2019 when it was closed to the public.
They were picked up from their Knightsbridge hotel by an official driver in a dark blue Range Rover used by Andrew and driven through the palace gates in the early afternoon.
Once inside they were taken through to the inner courtyard, where a female greeter was waiting to meet them. A video taken by the men from inside the car captured their arrival.
A former Royal Household employee, who reviewed the footage, told BBC News that it was clear that palace security staff on the gate were expecting the vehicle.
""The ramp was dropped before they came out to speak to the driver,"" they said. ""That was the reception we'd expect if we were carrying a member of the Royal Family.""
What happened once they went inside is disputed by the two men.
Mr Evers said they had been told in advance that there would be an opportunity to meet the Queen. But once there, he said staff told him he was not allowed to take photos.
""They didn't want anyone knowing that we were meeting Elizabeth. And it was very, very brief, she was not doing super well, so it was more just like a hello and in passing. No touching or anything,"" he said.
He said it wasn't a formal meeting, ""it was just like a quick, 'hello, goodbye'"".
The Queen was in residence that day, with her published schedule including her regular weekly audience with the prime minister. The Palace was unable to confirm or deny whether the introduction with the two men took place.
Responding to questions by email, Mr Bloom initially said he had decided just to visit the palace as a tourist. He subsequently said the only person he met at the palace was a ""staffer"".
When challenged and presented with evidence from his own social media, which included footage of him being driven into the palace, and comments about spending time with Andrew, and there being ""pictures I can post, the pictures I can't, and then the stuff I couldn't take pictures of... lol"", Mr Bloom said he had misremembered.
He then admitted that he ""was in fact shown to Andrews [sic] office and did thank him for the car and for him and Sarah arranging the tour"".
He denied ever having met or been in the same room as the late Queen.
Mr Bloom made a second visit to Buckingham Palace in July 2019, photos show. On social media he made an apparently joking reference to ""meeting HRH"".
Two months later, Ms Ferguson was one of two celebrity guests - alongside the motivational speaker Tony Robbins, who says he has coached figures such as Serena Williams and Hugh Jackman - at a ""ground breaking"" for Pegasus's energy project launch in the Arizona desert.
They were flown in, with Mr Bloom, Mr Evers and others, in two black-and-gold helicopters and posed with gold-coloured spades and construction hats at the remote site of what Pegasus promised would become a multi-billion-dollar off-grid data centre.
With armed guards with AR-15 rifles and pistols standing nearby, Mr Bloom introduced Ms Ferguson at a press conference as a ""personal friend"".
In the short speech that followed, Ms Ferguson praised the company, saying she was ""so proud to be here"" and touted the potential philanthropic uses of the technology in Africa.
That October, a month before Andrew's fateful BBC Newsnight interview where he disastrously attempted to explain his connections to Mr Epstein, Ms Ferguson signed a contract agreeing to provide specific services for Pegasus.
For reasons that remain unexplained, the contract itself was with Alphabet Capital, a British company whose owner, Adrian Gleave, ran a number of caravan and holiday parks.
A High Court ruling in London in 2024 has previously revealed that Ms Ferguson received more than £200,000 for her work for Pegasus from Alphabet Capital.
Andrew has also received money from Alphabet, including £60,500 traced to Mr Gleave and his businesses, according to court documents previously reported by the BBC.
Neither Andrew nor Mr Gleave have explained why this money was paid.
Mr Bloom said he has never heard of Alphabet or Mr Gleave and there was no connection with Pegasus.
A year after investing millions of dollars in the crypto solar scheme, some of its main investors became concerned about progress and began legal proceedings.
In 2023, judges from the Commercial Arbitration Tribunal in the US found in the investors' favour awarding them millions of dollars.
Jay Bloom has since mounted a number of legal challenges over the award in the Nevada courts.
Mr Bloom told BBC News that Pegasus emphatically disputed ""any allegations of misconduct"" and said they were ""addressing the clearly flawed arbitral findings through established legal processes"".
Andrew and Ms Ferguson did not respond to the BBC's questions, including whether Ms Ferguson planned to repay money received for her Pegasus work to the company's investors.
Mr Evers said he regretted being involved with Pegasus. He said Mr Bloom was ""working very, very hard to get all the investors paid back"" but that he was frustrated to still be owed money himself several years later.
The scandal engulfing Andrew is of his own making but has had a profound impact on his immediate family.
There are also no plans to formally remove Andrew from the line of succession, the government says.
The language of Buckingham Palace's statement is ""very brutal"", royal historian Kelly Swaby tells the BBC.
The sprawling Norfolk estate is home to several properties - here is a look at where Andrew might be moving in.
Some people in Carrickfergus suggest exchanging Prince Andrew Way for the name of another royal.

New York Times financial columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin's ""1929: Inside the Greatest Crash in Wall Street History - and How It Shattered a Nation"" (Viking) looks back to the nation's most catastrophic market collapse.  
Read an excerpt below. 
""1929"" by Andrew Ross Sorkin 
Prefer to listen? Audible has a 30-day free trial available right now.  
Charles Mitchell strode up the steps of 55 Wall Street, determined to project his usual sense of confidence and certitude. It had been a crushing afternoon. As he returned to his office, he knew that the eyes of Wall Street were on him — everyone from the traders in the street to his own secretary was assessing his gait and searching his face, trying to read meaning into every twitch, every line, every wrinkle.
In his gray three‑piece suit, shoulders back, Mitchell kept up his smile as he passed through the glass‑domed central hall of his National City Bank. With its eighty‑three‑foot ceiling and two solid bronze doors protecting a safe weighing some three hundred tons, the bank was the largest in the country.
It was just past 5:30 p.m. on Monday, October 28, 1929. Hours earlier, the stock market had closed with a sharp, dizzying drop of 13 percent after a week of downward convulsions; today was by far the greatest fall. The darkening downtown streets still teemed with anxious brokers in their fedoras and flat caps, messenger boys and switchboard girls, all gossiping and speculating about the collapse. What caused the fall? How much further might it go tomorrow? Would the markets even open?
As Mitchell made his way to his office, the teller windows he passed reflected the weary puffiness under his eyes and his disheveled, graying eyebrows. He collapsed into the chair behind his mahogany desk. The room was furnished with the high formality befitting an eighteenth‑century statesman: antique wood chairs, a grandfather clock that stood against the cream‑white woodwork flanked by portraits of George Washington orchestrating the newly independent nation with the purpose and resolve that Mitchell sought to emulate in his own life.
The athletic fifty‑two‑year‑old bank chairman — an unusually optimistic man whom the press called ""Sunshine Charlie"" — had spent the afternoon in emergency meetings at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, puzzling over how to calm the market. It was a moment for which a self‑consciously Great Man like Mitchell should have been utterly prepared. He had the experience, the stature, and the steely nerves necessary to steer Wall Street through these tough times.
Yet he felt exposed, vulnerable.
But he didn't have time to consider his emotional state.
He walked upstairs to confer with Hugh Baker, who ran National City's stock‑trading unit.
Baker, a tall, bald man with piercing eyes, began to explain to Mitchell, calmly, if somewhat obliquely, what had taken place while Mitchell had been at the Federal Reserve.
""Our portfolio today has been tremendously increased in our holdings of National City Bank stock,"" Baker told him.
Mitchell stared at him, waiting to hear exactly what he meant.
Baker finally blurted out: ""We purchased seventy‑odd thousand shares.""
Mitchell, who could calculate numbers instantly in his head, immediately grasped the nature and scale of the problem. That is unbelievable, he thought. The bank didn't have the cash to pay for so many shares. He was outraged — and terrified. Everything he had built was suddenly at grave risk of collapse.
Barely a month earlier, Mitchell had been on top of the world. He had finalized an agreement to take over the Corn Exchange Bank, a bold acquisition that would turn National City from the largest bank in the country into the largest in the world, stealing the mantle from London and helping New York finally eclipse its rival city as the world financial center. This was history in the making, an overthrow of the established order, the kind of gambit that made Mitchell a king among men.
But to pull off the deal, Mitchell had made a big — and risky — bet on the strength of his own stock. Corn Exchange shareholders could take $360 in cash for each of their shares, or four fifths of a share in National City Bank. On paper, the stock was the better deal: As long as National City stock stayed above $450, four fifths of a share was worth more than $360 in cash. At the time the deal was struck, it was comfortably higher, trading at $496 a share. Mitchell needed it to stay there until the deal could be completed, likely in the next month — because, in truth, National City didn't have the cash to pay everyone, a crucial detail he kept to himself.
So he quietly instructed his traders to buy the bank's shares whenever the price slipped.
In a relatively stable market, this posed no problem. Big publicly traded companies bought back their own shares all the time. In a rapidly falling market, however, doing so could quickly become like shoveling money into a furnace, which was what had been happening that afternoon. In the chaos of all that selling pressure, National City's bids had been accepted so quickly that they lost track of how many they had amassed. By the time traders got a handle on the situation, National City had committed to buy seventy‑one thousand of its own shares, far more than it could afford to hold.
""With that news,"" he told Baker, ""I could be knocked over with a feather.""
There were very few good options. To fund their daily operations, big banks like National City had to constantly borrow against their assets. But banking law prevented them from offering their own stock as collateral. Thus, those seventy‑one thousand shares — which cost about $32 million — were a deadweight that could possibly take down the whole bank.
""It would be embarrassing for us to attempt to borrow on that stock in other banks,"" Mitchell said, knowing full well that his rivals would seize on any such move as a sign of vulnerability. With the market in free fall, short sellers — traders who bet that stocks would go down — were lining up targets, probing for weakness.
The stock market was at the breaking point. Sales volume had overwhelmed the human apparatus of the trading floor to such an extent that, on the previous Thursday, the ticker had fallen four hours behind in reporting stock prices, more than twice the longest previous delay.
What this meant was that the big board of prices that loomed over the floor of the New York Stock Exchange was hopelessly inaccurate. Trading stocks in this environment was like being a gambler at a baseball game in the eighth inning and looking at a scoreboard that hadn't been updated since the third, while everybody around you was shouting conflicting opinions about which team was ahead and by how much. The prices of stocks sold privately — known as ""off‑exchange,"" which was the case with National City shares — were even further behind because they were tied to the broader market's movements without being fully updated in real time, exacerbating the delay. For Wall Street traders, the only prudent decision was to sell and get the hell out of the market. Which is exactly what they were doing.
Mitchell knew that if he tried to unload even a small fraction of National City's position back into such a weak market, rumors would begin to fly about the bank's solvency, and that could easily turn into a vicious cycle that would be impossible to stop. If prices declined fast enough, it could trigger a much larger crisis: A ""lack of confidence might bring a run,"" Mitchell told Baker, envisioning depositors lining up outside every one of its fifty‑eight branches around the country.
A run on the country's largest bank. There was nothing bankers feared more.

43,2025-11-02,"A taste of a German Christmas market at home

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Nespresso has just launched its latest advent calendar, which includes a set of new festive flavors to replace your usual morning brew. Some of the highlights include Cinnamon and Candied Tamarind and Festive Double Espresso, but the one that particularly piqued my interest was the unusual combo of Sweet Almond and Hibiscus.
I tend to associate the taste of hibiscus with herbal teas, where it often serves as a backdrop to fruit flavors, but I've never encountered it in coffee before, so I was curious to see how well it would co-ordinate with the beans. It's not a flavor that I'd typically associate with Christmas, but almond certainly is. I love old-fashioned Christmas cake with a layer of marzipan under the icing, so I hoped that this coffee would evoke that flavor, with the fruity arabica beans taking the place of the traditional dense fruit cake.
The Sweet Almond and Hibiscus pods are tucked away in this year's Nespresso advent calendar, but you can also buy them in packs of 10, in Nespresso Original or Vertuo form.
When buying your coffee pods, it's important to choose the ones that are compatible with your machine. Vertuo pods are dome-shaped, and only work with Nespresso Vertuo machines. They come in different sizes, and your coffee maker will detect the type you've inserted and brew the appropriate volume.
The Hibiscus and Sweet Almond capsules, for example, will make a 230ml mug of coffee, whereas the Festive Double Espresso pods will make a shorter 80ml drink.
Nespresso Original pods, which are shaped a bit like top hats, work with third-party machines like the Grind One and the Ninja Prestige DualBrew System. That's because Nestlé no longer owns the patent on this style of pod. If you use Nespresso Original capsules, the volume of your drink will be determined by the machine. You might get a choice or you might not, but many give you a choice of single or double shots.
My machine is a Nespresso Vertuo Pop, so I opted for the rounded pods. The Vertuo Pop is an excellent option if you have a small kitchen, and has long held a place in our guide to the best Nespresso Machines thanks to its low price and great performance.
Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.
It has a small water tank that can brew two mugs of coffee at a push before it needs refilling, but is otherwise easy to recommend. If there are multiple coffee-drinkers in your household then the Nespresso Vertuo Pop+ is very similar, but with a bigger tank for more brews.
Both machines often get a generous discount for Black Friday, sometimes dropping down to half the list price, and make a great Christmas gift if you have a friend or loved one who enjoys experimenting with different types of coffee.
Despite its small size, the Vertuo Pop is fast to heat, and less than a minute after inserting the Sweet Almond and Hibiscus pod, I had a mug full of fragrant coffee ready to sample – and it was delicious. I can't say I really noticed the hibiscus flavor very much, but the almond really comes to the fore, reminding me of traditional German marzipan cookies, or a huge slab of almond nougat purchased at a Christmas market after having a little too much glühwein (hey, it happens).
Despite its name, the drink isn't excessively sweet, which was a pleasant surprise. Some other coffees with added flavors can be a little on the sickly side, but that's not the case here, and although the almond is quite strong, it complements the medium-roasted arabica beans rather than competing with them.
 



It's a taste that handles dairy particularly well, and I've been enjoying it with a generous splash of full-fat milk (though plant-based alternatives would be great as well). If you're using one of the Nespresso Original pods to make an espresso, it would be perfect as part of a creamy latte.
If you want something more indulgent, Nespresso provides a recipe for a Golden Hibiscus Latte on its website, which involves the addition of milk, honey, and cherries in syrup, all topped with edible dried rose petals. Who needs pumpkin spice?

Senior Contributor.
Without Miguel Rojas, the Los Angeles Dodgers would have flown home from Toronto unhappy.
The last-place hitter in the lineup, the light-hitting Rojas clobbered a solo home run in the top of the ninth to tie the seventh game of the World Series, then fired a bullet in the bottom half to nail prevent Isaiah Kiner-Falefa from scoring the winning run on an infield grounder.
Just one night earlier, Rojas also rode to the rescue in the last of the ninth: he scooped a low throw to second that completed a game-ending double-play for the Dodgers.
On a team that tops its lineup with three former Most Valuable Players, the little-known, little-used Rojas not only proved his value to the Dodgers but also to the 29 other teams – any of which could sign him as a free agent.
The 36-year-old middle infielder is one of five potential free agents who could take their World Series rings and head for greener pastures.
Also eligible to walk away are outfielder Michael Conforto and relief pitchers Michael Kopech and Kirby Yates. Another pitcher, lifetime Dodger Clayton Kershaw, has already announced his desire to retire while the club options of third baseman Max Muncy ($10 million) and set-up reliever Alex Vesia ($3.6 million) are virtually certain to be renewed.
Of that group, Rojas was in the right spot at the right time. After hitting .262 with seven home runs and 27 runs batted in over 114 games during the regular season, he had hit only .154 with two hits in 13 at-bats during post-season play. One of those hits was his no-doubt homer into the Southern California night as the clock struck midnight Saturday.
Often used as a defensive replacement, Rojas hit only two home runs after the July All-Star break. And he did not start any of the first five World Series games before Dodgers manager Dave Roberts, who moves players like real-life chess pieces, deployed him at second base over Tommy Edman, the victim of a sore ankle. Edman started instead in center field.    
Paid $5.5 million by the Dodgers in 2025, Rojas wrote himself a significant raise with his World Series performance.
Kershaw’s last hurrah was a World Series relief appearance in which he worked one-third of an inning without yielding a hit or run. Fellow lefty Vesia was unavailable for the World Series because of a pressing personal matter but will surely be welcomed back.
Toronto faces bigger losses in the free agent market.
It could lose slugging shortstop Bo Bichette, first baseman Ty France, jack-of-all-trades Isiah Kiner-Falefa, reliever Seranthony Dominguez, and starting pitchers Max Scherzer, Shane Bieber, and Chris Bassitt. Scherzer and Bieber have four Cy Young Awards between them.
Bichette, still just 27, would be the biggest loss for the Jays. He not only batted .311, second only to Aaron Judge in the majors this season, but had the best batting average in the majors with men in scoring position (.381). Even though a knee injury suffered Sept. 6 knocked him out of the playoffs before the World Series, Bichette still led the Jays in hits (181) and runs batted in (94).
The son of former Colorado slugger Dante Bichette also proved his versatility in the final round, when he played several games at second base – a completely unfamiliar position – in an effort to protect his ailing knee.
Because he’s a bat-first middle infielder, Bichette could wind up with a team willing to sacrifice his defense liabilities for his offensive prowess (the Yankees or Braves, for example). He could also serve as a DH on days when his knee starts barking.
He might not sign right away, however, because his demands for a contract rich in years and dollars might be hard to find – even in a market thin on shortstops. Bichette made $21 million in 2025, according to Spotrac.
Scherzer, 41, might be too old and too expensive for some teams even after proving his value in two starts – including Game 7 – against the Dodgers. He too has to prove healthy for any signing team to protect its investment.
Bassitt, pushing 37, might prove a better bet, though he’ll seek more than the $21 million the Jays paid him in 2025. Scherzer, by contrast, was paid $15.5 million and Bieber $13 million – though he could exercise a player option that would grant him a $3 million raise.
Just over 30 years old, Bieber showed gradual improvement in 2025 after returning from Tommy John elbow surgery. But he was the losing pitcher in World Series Game 7.
Dominguez, the same age, is a solid set-up reliever when he has both velocity and command of his arsenal. He’s certain to sign for more than the $3,625,000 he made in a season split between Toronto and Philadelphia.
After giving Vladimir Guerrero, Jr. a 14-year, $500 million extension last year, the Jays would love to keep at least some of their prospective free agent class. But that might not be possible.
Free agency officially begins five days after the World Series but November signings are rare because players and agents with multiple suitors like to surmise offers before signing. That’s especially true of those represented by California-based super-agent Scott Boras.
Suffice to say the rosters of both World Series teams will definitely be different next year.

45,2025-11-02,"Samsung flagships ahoy

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

We're expecting quite a few high-end Samsung Galaxy phones over the coming weeks and months, and two fresh leaks have offered some pointers over when we might see the Galaxy S26 series and the tri-fold foldable that Samsung has been working on.
First up, the Samsung Galaxy S26 phones. We think there will be three models this year (a standard, a Plus, an Ultra), with the possibility of a fourth model to succeed the Galaxy S25 Edge – which may end up being even thinner.
Now there's a report from South Korean outlet Money Today (via @Jukanlosreve) stating that some or all of these Galaxy S26 handsets will be unveiled on Wednesday, February 25, with an event to be held in San Francisco in the US.
That's later in the year than the Galaxy S25 launch, which happened on January 22, and that tracks with previous rumors of delays. The report also repeats an earlier rumor that the standard, Plus, and Ultra models will all use Samsung's own Exynos chips.
 



Then we have Samsung's tri-fold, which was first teased at the launch of the Galaxy S25 back in January, and seems likely to arrive before the end of the year – Samsung's first phone with two hinges rather than one.
The team at SamMobile has spotted that the phone has now been through the necessary regulatory steps to be recognized as a device with Bluetooth capabilities, which is a step that usually means a piece of hardware is about to be launched.
As per sources speaking to SamMobile, the tri-fold is going to be made available in the US, China, South Korea, and the UAE to begin with. It may then be sold in additional countries sometime in 2026, but that's far from certain at the moment.
Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.
The Samsung tri-fold was officially shown off earlier this week for the first time, at the K-Tech Showcase in South Korea. However, it was out of reach in a display case, so the reveal didn't really tell us much that was new.

The third-quarter earnings season begins its second busiest week, with 135 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. Notable companies scheduled to release earnings include: Palantir (PLTR), Pfizer (PFE), Yum! Brands (YUM), Emerson Electric (EMR), McDonald’s (MCD), Humana (HUM), and Qualcomm (QCOM). Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) reported better-than-expected earnings on Saturday. A deeper dive and insights into Berkshire Hathaway’s third-quarter earnings are here.
With 64% of companies reporting so far, 83% have beaten consensus earnings estimates.  The earnings season preview from last week contains more details about the underlying drivers of earnings.
Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 10.7% year-over-year, above the expectations of 7.9% at the end of the quarter. The expected earnings growth rates for calendar years 2025 and 2026 increased to 11.2% and 14.0%, respectively.
The continuation of the strong earnings season helped lift the S&P 500 last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week.
Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remained the group to watch this earnings season. Despite the disappointments from Tesla (TSLA) and Meta Platforms (META), the rest of the group picked up the slack. Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon.com (AMZN) continued to support the thesis that demand for artificial intelligence (AI) is driving robust growth.
Meta Platforms (META) posted disappointing headline earnings due to a non-cash tax charge. More importantly, investors were spooked by the announcement of more than $100 billion in planned investments in AI next year. As a positive, third-quarter revenues grew 26% year over year, and their ad business continues to post impressive results, so the underlying business remains robust.
NVIDIA (NVDA), the last of the Magnificent 7 to report earnings, is scheduled to report on November 19.
According to FactSet data, the positive earnings surprises from companies in the information technology, consumer discretionary, and health care sectors were the most significant contributors to the S&P 500’s earnings growth rate increase last week. As detailed above, the communication services sector was the largest detractor due to Meta’s earnings miss.
Within technology, Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) were the most significant positive drivers. Amazon.com (AMZN) was the most crucial positive surprise in consumer discretionary, while Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK), and Gilead Sciences (GILD) were the most notable positive surprises in health care.
Sales growth at 7.9% is running well above expectations. Three sectors are on pace for double-digit year-over-year sales growth this quarter: information technology, communication services, and health care.
With the government shutdown continuing to drag on, US economic releases should remain relatively sparse. Importantly, the widely watched monthly jobs report is likely to be delayed by the government closure. Instead, the private ADP employment change release on Wednesday and the Challenger job-cut announcement report on Thursday will attract more attention than usual as investors and economists gauge the softness of the US labor market.
Third-quarter earnings reports will fill the void during the second busiest reporting week of the season. While a better-than-expected earnings season is all but assured, the individual company reports and any commentary about future earnings expectations remain crucial.
As widely anticipated, the Federal Reserve (Fed) delivered a 25 basis point (0.25%) rate cut at its meeting last Wednesday. Fed Chair Powell pushed back harder than expected against the market expectations of another cut at the December meeting, sending the odds to a little less than a 2-in-3 chance. The calendar is chock-full of Fed members speaking this week, so their comments will be closely monitored to gauge better the likelihood of a Fed easing in December.

48,2025-11-02,"On November 5th, we’ll get the ADP numbers for private NFP. Bloomberg consensus is for +28K, while betting on Kalshi is for +43K. We won’t have October numbers from the BLS for some time, if ever (so EJ Antoni may get his wish, although quarterly employment numbers given no data collection might not be more accurate in this case). If the ADP release hits the consensus number, here’s the picture of the labor market.

 

Figure 1: Implied NFP preliminary benchmark (blue), NFP early benchmark, using latest changes for extended forecast period (red), civilian employment – experimental series using smoothed population controls, 3 month centered moving average (green), and ADP private NFP (tan), all in logs, 2025M01=0. October ADP figure is Bloomberg Consensus. Source: BLS, ADP via FRED, BLS, Philadelphia Fed, and author’s calculations.
If it’s true the the civilian employment series — based on the household survey — peaks either contemporaneously of before the BLS NFP series as is sometimes asserted (see discussion here), then we should worry (note the civilian employment series is not revised month by month, so the trajectory of this series will not change over time).
Since the current betting is on about 46.5 days shutdown (taking us to mid-November), I suspect we will have to wait quite a while for the government’s latest reading on the labor market.

We're a married couple who channeled our mutual obsession with true crime into a full-time podcasting business that eventually replaced our careers.
We gave four years of our lives to one particularly haunting murder case — the Delphi murders —  producing hundreds of podcast episodes, breaking news, and ultimately writing and publishing a crime nonfiction book about the mystery.
Things got pretty wild. We endured extreme conditions at a month-long murder trial, sitting out in the cold, going without food or water, and skipping sleep in order to get a seat every single day. In a contracting media market, our podcast came to dominate coverage of the case.
We managed to do it all as an independent husband-and-wife team, and despite struggles along the way, the experience ultimately made our marriage and working relationship stronger.
The way the two of us met sounds like something out of a slightly twisted Hallmark movie.
We both got interested in the same cold case, and Kevin — an intellectual property attorney in Indiana — noticed Áine, a reporter in New York on Business Insider's retail desk, was saving articles about a mystery he was investigating for a victim's relative on a media archive website and reached out.
We became friends first, bonding over our love of true crime. Texting turned into hours-long phone calls where we would joke around, share stories, and discuss favorite films and authors and books. We became extremely close, long-distance.
Later on, we discovered — much to our surprise — that we had fallen in love.
Kevin moved from Indiana to NYC, and from a tiny 350-square-foot studio apartment in Fort Greene, we launched a true crime podcast, The Murder Sheet, and hoped it might attract a small, niche audience.
It's easy to start a podcast. Making a living with one is far more difficult.
There are literally millions of podcasts available; the listener has a wealth of choices, and the audience is spread thin.
In the beginning, we didn't worry about the financial angles; our focus was on using journalistic and legal principles to discuss true crime ethically and responsibly.
In our first year, we made about $300 from a scattering of programmatic ads, and more in year two as a sizable audience discovered — and stuck by — us.
By the beginning of year three, we felt confident enough to make the show our full-time jobs.
There have been occasional periods of financial stress. Podcasting is cyclical, and like any media dependent on ad revenue, there are ups and downs. We try to keep our operating costs low and write, edit, produce, and promote the show ourselves, so the creative control is in our hands.
Our earnings have become more stable with time. We've carved out an audience of like-minded people who are interested in a more factual, less sensationalized true crime show. Going forward, we don't plan to make any big changes, except for perhaps expanding to other platforms like YouTube and TikTok.
Neither of us knew any other couples who worked together this closely. We feel lucky, but wouldn't recommend it to everyone. We happen to have personalities that are largely similar and complementary —  the same insatiable curiosity and a quirky, occasionally morbid sense of humor, which buoys us during and after working hours. We derive a lot of joy from chatting about a new case, watching trials, or digging up obscure facts about a historical crime together.
We've had to learn to ease off at times, like when something goes wrong at work. We really try to guard our free time and prevent work from intruding, although that's sometimes difficult. The best piece of advice we could offer to any married couple trying to work together: Hold those boundaries.
The story centers around 13-year-old Abby Williams and 14-year-old Libby German, two best friends who lived in Delphi, Indiana. In February 2017, the girls went hiking on a forested trail and walked onto a deserted bridge. As they were approached by a strange man, Libby took out her phone and managed to capture his image and voice on video. Brandishing a gun, he forced the girls down a hill and across Deer Creek, ultimately murdering them.
The fact that Libby recorded her killer helped take the story national.
We broke into the case in 2021, after we moved to Indiana from New York for a lower cost of living. We spent time in the community of Delphi, allowing us to gather sources and break news on the case. Pretty quickly, we realized we had something to add.
We knew that a podcast was not the only way to cover it; we wanted to write a book. Luckily, one of the first agents we approached shared our love of crime nonfiction and was interested in working with us.
Once there was an arrest in October of 2022 — a man named Richard Allen, a quiet local CVS manager — we knew that the time was right. Whether he was acquitted or convicted, the trial would provide some answers about the case.
The trial took place across a wintry October and November in Indiana. Access was extremely limited; there were no cameras in the courtroom and only a couple of dozen seats available to the public.
In order to secure a place, we'd get in line in the frigid cold at 3 a.m., then midnight, and then even earlier as the trial went on. In the early morning hours, the ramp outside the courthouse would be packed with dozens of people huddled in sleeping bags or portable chairs. At night, temperatures would drop to the 30s. Friends brought us lawn chairs, electric blankets, and disposable hand warmers, and we bundled in layers and blankets.
The case attracted a lot of unstable people, so sometimes we feared confrontations or fights breaking out in the line. But for the most part, those waiting to get into court got along well.
At least one of us managed to get into the trial every day. We gave up eating and drinking in the mornings, as heading to the restroom during the day would result in a forfeited seat. Every night, we'd go home and immediately record a multi-hour podcast episode based on pages and pages of trial notes. We struggled with fatigue, dehydration, hunger, and the cold for most of the time.
Enduring the process together strengthened us. We learned to let a lot of minor annoyances go and made a pact to be as patient, calm, and compassionate with each other as we could be at all times.
Kind listeners ended up volunteering to hold our spots in line as the weeks went on. We wouldn't have been able to report the story without them. As a result of our trial coverage, our podcast broke into the Top 100 list on Apple Podcasts for all podcasts for the first time ever.
Our book, ""Shadow of the Bridge: The Delphi Murders and the Dark Side of the American Heartland,"" includes exclusive, unprecedented access to the main players in the story — family members, prosecutors, detectives, and members of the Delphi community — and pieces together all the turns of the investigation.
When the guilty verdict finally came in, it felt like we had spent a month on a dreary, depressing campout. Going inside and thawing out felt nice, and we had no doubt the jury got it right, but we couldn't relax. We had to scrap parts of our book draft and add complicated new details we'd learned in the trial while cutting extraneous minutiae so our readers wouldn't get lost.
For a month, we pulled 15-hour workdays, working late into the night and on weekends. For a while we felt more like drudges in the same miserable workplace than spouses, but we knew it would come to an end.
The book has been successful so far, and our publisher is happy. We are too. That said, no sensible person should get into book-writing to make big money — especially not crime nonfiction about a depressing double homicide.
The book was never a financial move for us. It helps build our profile and credibility, but more importantly, it shares the truth about a case with the public. It was an honor to get to tell the story, and witness firsthand the men and women — detectives, prosecutors, volunteers, and victims' relatives alike — who strived to get justice in the case.
Our hearts still are broken for those girls and their families. We gave a chunk of our advance to a charity that memorializes Libby and Abby with scholarship funds and a beautiful park.
The hardest part about covering Delphi has been questioning our faith in humanity. Not only did we cover a case where a man senselessly murdered two children, but we saw a lot of sordid, dishonorable, and downright bizarre, both in the courtroom and online from conspiracy theorists and content creators out to rake in views. Getting to observe and interview the men and women who truly cared about the girls gave us back some hope.
We want to keep covering cases meticulously and with empathy on the podcast, and to write more crime nonfiction books. Our ultimate goal is to fill up a whole shelf of our bookcase with works we wrote. This experience taught us what we are capable of and ultimately reminded us why we got into true crime — to work closely together on a shared passion project, and to tell the stories of the human beings behind the headlines.

When Michael Permana realized his software engineering job at Amazon was at risk, he didn't panic. He took paternity leave.
Permana's job security concerns began in February 2023, when he was placed on a performance improvement plan — a move he saw as a clear sign his job was in serious jeopardy.
""I was desperate because from what I'd heard, once you are in a performance improvement plan, you are on your way out at Amazon,"" said the 47-year-old, who lives in California.
He began looking for work immediately but knew it might take a while to land a new role, and he was worried about not being able to earn a paycheck when he had a mortgage to pay.
Then he had an idea. His daughter had been born the previous May, and he still had a few remaining months of paternity leave before it expired when she turned one year old. By temporarily stepping away from work, he thought he might be able to prolong his employment at Amazon while he searched for a new role.
""I took the opportunity while I could to delay time,"" he said.
It paid off. Less than a month after returning to work, Permana received a job offer for a software engineering position at MobilityWare, a mobile game developer.
While layoffs across the economy remain low by historical standards, white-collar workers have been disproportionately affected — and a hiring slowdown has made it harder for them to secure new roles. Business Insider has spoken with dozens of people laid off by major corporations as companies implement strategic shifts — including shedding management roles, reallocating resources toward AI initiatives, pushing out underperformers, and cutting costs across the board.
Some of these workers saw their layoffs coming, but many others were caught off guard — citing factors like long tenure, a lack of performance issues, and the seemingly strong financial position of their employers.
Rather than simply working hard and hoping for the best, some workers have prepared for the worst — deploying strategies like getting a head start on their job search, launching a side business, or secretly working a second job.
Laura Ulrich, director of economic research at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said some workers may be feeling anxious about job security because lower hiring levels have raised concerns about their ability to find a new role if a layoff were to occur. And because hiring was so much stronger in many industries just a few years ago, the shift may feel especially stark.
""If you become unemployed, it's become much harder to find a job,"" she said.
Ulrich added that the hype surrounding the potential of AI technologies has also given some workers reason to worry about their job security — even as the full impact of these technologies remains to be seen.

Eduardo Noriega first began worrying about his job security at Microsoft in 2009, when the company laid off about 5,000 workers. He was spared, but it was a wake-up call.
""When I saw the layoff, I realized that job security isn't real,"" said Noriega, who's in his 50s and lives in Seattle.
After weighing his options, Noriega concluded that his best chance at financial stability was to build a business he could rely on if he ever lost his job. He said it was one of the best career decisions he's ever made.
By the time he was laid off by Microsoft this past May, he'd spent nearly a decade building a staffing firm outside work hours — and was earning more from it than from his software engineering job. He said he had been hesitant to quit and give up the steady paycheck, but the layoff gave him the push he needed to go all in.
""I never dared to quit,"" he said. ""And then Microsoft presented the layoff, and for me, that was like an exit.""
Many of the workers Business Insider spoke with who had the greatest concerns about job security — and who took steps to guard against it — had either been laid off in the past or witnessed significant cuts at their employers.
After getting laid off from four tech jobs between 2020 and 2023, Reed, who is in his 30s and lives in New York, was desperate for some level of job security. Business Insider verified his identity, but he requested to use a pseudonym due to concerns about professional repercussions.
After his fourth layoff, Reed had a eureka moment.
""I was like, the only way for me to combat not continuously being unemployed is to have two jobs,"" he said.
As of earlier this year, Reed was on track to earn about $280,000 working two full-time remote jobs. He said his typical workweek is about 60 hours, and neither employer knows about the other gig — but he thinks it's worth it for the additional job security.
""I need these two jobs to sustain my life with my partner,"" he said, adding, ""I don't really have a choice.""
Not all job jugglers are as ambitious as Reed. Some, like John, a millennial software engineer based in California, are boosting their job security by taking on a part-time role on the side. He expects to earn about $225,000 this year, including around $60,000 from his part-time gig. John said his main employer knows he has a side gig of some sort, but doesn't know the specifics of the role — or how many hours he devotes to it.
In addition to his part-time gig, John has become less concerned about his job security as he has developed his network over the years. If he were to be laid off from his primary job, he said he knows several startup founders and hiring managers in his industry who he believes would help him find employment.
""I'm pretty confident that I'd be able to secure another full-time job in pretty short order,"" he said.
Earlier this year, a strategic shift at Intel led Kent Ha, then a digital marketing strategist, to believe that his team's jobs were in jeopardy. He'd already been laid off twice over the past decade — in 2015 and 2020 — and wanted to avoid a lengthy spell of unemployment. So in June, he contacted his financial advisor to help him prepare financially — and started applying for jobs.
""I figured worst case, I'd land another offer and have a backup plan,"" he said. ""Best case, I'd keep my job and wouldn't have to make any changes.""
When the feared layoff came in July, Ha was already in the middle of a job search. While he's still looking for work, he's glad he got a head start.
For some workers, the best way to ease their job security concerns is by accumulating savings that can help them stay afloat during unemployment — or give them the freedom to leave a job that doesn't feel stable.
Phil Coachman, formerly a senior cloud solution architect at Microsoft, said that the company's layoffs conducted in 2023 raised significant concerns about his job security. Other frustrations with his role followed, and in July 2024, he began looking for a new opportunity.
""I just didn't feel happy there anymore,"" said Coachman, who's in his 40s and lives in Pennsylvania. ""I wanted to just continue making cool stuff and not have this constant fear of losing my job every week.""
However, Coachman's search proved challenging, and by January of this year, he decided to resign in order to focus on his job search. He said the ""rainy day fund"" he'd built over the years helped him feel comfortable doing so.
""I had enough savings that even if it would take me a year to find a job, I would be fine,"" he said. ""So it was just getting the courage to take that jump.""
While his savings helped him stay afloat during his job search, Coachman said deciding to rely more on his network after he resigned is what landed him a new job. A former Microsoft colleague referred him for a role at the AI startup Databricks, which led to an interview — and, in April, a job offer.
His network couldn't protect him from being laid off, but it helped him end his spell of unemployment — and made him feel a bit less concerned about his job security going forward.
""Finding my next gig was 100% through my network,"" he said, adding, ""It's real connections with people that I think make all the difference.""

51,2025-11-02,Medical technology company Inspire Medical Systems (NYSE:INSP) will be reporting earnings this Monday after market close. Here’s what to expect.
52,2025-11-02,"ByStuart Anderson,
Senior Contributor.
The Trump administration will publish a new immigration rule expected to price many H-1B visa holders and employment-based immigrants out of the U.S. labor market. The White House included the plan in the proclamation announcing a $100,000 fee on many H-1B visa holders. The new Department of Labor rule will likely be similar to the two attempts in Donald Trump’s first term to raise the salaries of high-skilled foreign nationals beyond what most employers can afford to pay. A significant body of research indicates that H-1B visa holders are paid the same or higher salaries than U.S. workers with comparable levels of education and experience.
H-1B temporary visas are often the only way for high-skilled foreign nationals to work in the United States long term. When companies recruit at U.S. universities, they find that international students account for 73% of full-time graduate students in electrical and computer engineering. The H-1B annual limit is 65,000, with an exemption of 20,000 for individuals with master’s degrees or higher from a U.S. university, or about 0.05% of the U.S. labor force. In addition to government fees that can exceed $6,000, employers must pay the higher of the actual or prevailing wage paid to U.S. professionals with similar experience and qualifications. 
Trump administration officials understood that the $100,000 fee to hire new H-1B visa holders contained in the Sept. 19 presidential proclamation would be prohibitive for employers, effectively blocking many high-skilled foreign nationals from ever working in the United States. They also knew it could not stop all H-1B professionals because the relevant section of U.S. law only allowed the proclamation to prevent the “entry” of H-1B professionals.
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services released new guidance on Oct. 20 clarifying that the $100,000 fee would not apply when people change from one visa category to another without leaving the country, such as moving from F-1 student status to H-1B status. However, that did not mean the Trump officials directing immigration policy hoped to encourage a shift toward more international students. (The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has filed a lawsuit against the H-1B fee. That followed an earlier lawsuit from a diverse group of plaintiffs filed on Oct. 3.)
The Trump administration has enacted several measures that make it less likely that international students will view the United States as the best place to pursue an education and launch a career. In August, DHS proposed a rule to limit international students by replacing the current “duration of status” policy with fixed admission periods. In September, Trump administration officials proposed a new immigration rule to change the H-1B selection process to favor senior-level candidates over recent international students. An upcoming rule is expected to restrict H-1B visa eligibility for all types of foreign nationals.
The proclamation included a section that would affect every H-1B visa holder and applicants for employment-based green cards. The section called for the Department of Labor to publish a new rule to “revise the prevailing wage levels.”
Although the publication date remains uncertain, the Trump administration’s new DOL wage rule is expected to be similar to the rules published in 2020 and 2021. Those rules, which did not go into effect, inflated the salaries that the federal government requires employers to pay for employment-based immigrants and H-1B visa holders. Three courts blocked the first DOL rule, published on October 8, 2020, because it violated the Administrative Procedure Act by taking effect immediately as an interim final rule without adequate justification. The second version, published as a final rule on January 14, 2021, also did not take effect. The Biden administration did not support the rule’s substantive changes to DOL regulations.
Under the law, an employer petitioning for an H-1B professional must pay “at least- (I) the actual wage level paid by the employer to all other individuals with similar experience and qualifications for the specific employment in question, or (II) the prevailing wage level for the occupational classification in the area of employment, whichever is greater.” (Emphasis added.) When sponsoring an individual for an employment-based green card through the DOL PERM process, employers must also pay at least the prevailing wage for the occupation in which the employee will work.
The two DOL rules published during Donald Trump’s first term ignored the definition of prevailing wage that appears on the Department of Labor website, which states, “The prevailing wage rate is defined as the average wage paid to similarly employed workers in a specific occupation in the area of intended employment.” 
“By requiring H-1B visa holders and employment-based immigrants to be paid well above the market wage for their services, the final rule makes it much more difficult for employers to sponsor high-skilled foreign nationals, including recent international students,” according to a 2021 National Foundation for American Policy analysis. “As economists know, when you raise the price of something, you get less of it. Given the substantial contributions made by employment-based immigrants, if the final rule goes into effect, it will mean America will get fewer jobs and startup companies, and less innovation.”
Currently, to determine the prevailing wage, which is the minimum an employer can pay a foreign national, DOL gathers data from the government’s Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics survey and uses a mathematical formula to create four wage levels for each occupation and location. “The Department of Labor’s OEWS wage levels are designed as a job classification tool that reflects the amount of experience, supervision and responsibility required for a position,” said Vic Goel of Goel & Anderson in an interview. “A Level I role is simply an entry-level version of the occupation, while Level IV is a senior-level position requiring greater judgment and independence.” Level II is “qualified” and Level III is “experienced.”
To raise wage requirements, Trump officials changed the formula to calculate the required minimum wage for permanent residence and temporary visas. In practice, the two DOL rules pushed the current minimum required salaries for Level I to or beyond the equivalent of the current Level II and raised the other levels as well. The result distorted what employers would pay when hiring or sponsoring a high-skilled foreign national.
An NFAP analysis found that, on average, the first DOL wage rule would have raised the required minimum salary level by 39% to 45%, likely making it prohibitively expensive for employers to hire H-1B visa holders or sponsor high-skilled foreign nationals for permanent residence. Employers found increases under the rule in individual areas and occupations to be exorbitant.
NFAP found, under the rule, that companies would be required to pay software developers $208,000 a year, regardless of skill level, in San Jose, San Francisco and many other U.S. cities, including Battle Creek, MI, Cape Coral-Fort Myers, FL and Reno, NV. Almost 40% of all approved PERM labor certifications for employment-based green cards are for software developers. The new DOL wage system under the rule required employers to pay precisely $100 an hour, or $208,000 a year, for over 18,000 combinations of occupations and geographic labor markets, regardless of skill level and position. 
The required minimum annual salary for a computer and information systems manager at Level I in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, increased 207% under the wage rule, while a hospital employing a pediatrician in Wichita, Kansas, at Level I would need to pay 177% more a year. In New York, compared to a private wage survey, an employer needed to pay a financial analyst more than three times the market wage ($208,000 vs. $66,428) to comply with the DOL rule.
In the Los Angeles area, under the DOL wage rule, employing H-1B visa holders as software developers (system) would have cost companies 62% more than the market wage at Level I. 
On January 14, 2021, Trump officials shrugged off the judicial decisions that blocked the October rule and published a final rule instituting a new DOL wage system. The final rule represented only a slight improvement for employers. To comply with the rule, companies would have needed to pay employees, on average, far more than under the current system: 24% higher for Level I positions, 23% higher for Level II, 27% higher for Level III and 25% higher for Level IV. Being required to pay a salary premium of $30,000 to $40,000 or more annually for an H-1B visa holder or green card recipient would likely lead employers to hire individuals outside the United States or not at all.
If history repeats itself, analysts expect the Trump administration to offer a weak justification for inflating the salaries of H-1B visa holders and employment-based immigrants beyond market wages. 
Madeline Zavodny, an economics professor at the University of North Florida and a former economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (and Dallas), analyzed DOL’s October 2020 interim final rule for a lawsuit and found the agency could not support its assertion that H-1B temporary holders are paid less than similarly employed U.S. workers. “Indeed, I believe this claim is not true,” wrote Zavodny. “This claim appears to form much of the basis for the Department’s proposed changes to the prevailing wage determination process for the H-1B nonimmigrant visa program and the EB-3 permanent resident visa program. . . . [E]mpirical evidence compiled by economists and other academic researchers indicates that workers who hold an H-1B visa are typically paid at least as much as similarly employed U.S.-born workers.”
Among the examples of past research concluding H-1B visa holders are paid the same or more than similar U.S. workers:
-         The Government Accountability Office found H-1B professionals generally earn the same or more than their U.S. counterparts after comparing the median reported salaries of U.S. workers and H-1B professionals in the same fields and age groups.
-         University of Maryland researchers Sunil Mithas and Henry C. Lucas, Jr. examined the skills and compensation of over 50,000 IT professionals in the United States and found foreign-born professionals in information technology earned more than their native counterparts. 
-         Economists Magnus Lofstrom and Joseph Hayes with the Public Policy Institute of California concluded, “We find that overall H-1B workers in STEM occupations have higher earnings than their otherwise observationally similar U.S.-born counterparts.”
Economists criticized the evidence presented in the Trump administration’s proclamation to justify a $100,000 fee on H-1B visa holders, particularly the claim that “one study of tech workers showed a 36 percent discount for H-1B ‘entry-level’ positions as compared to full-time, traditional workers.” The study reached that conclusion only by comparing individuals with little to no labor-market experience to people who have worked for many years in the same occupation, a comparison economists consider invalid.
“What does the 36 percent number compare those wages to?” asks George Mason University economics professor Michael Clemens in an analysis for PIEE. “The study tells you, right in the same table: It’s comparing the entry-level wage for H-1B workers to the average wage for everyone in that occupation, at all levels of experience, seniority, degrees, and technical knowledge. That reasoning would not pass muster in even an introductory economics course.”
Clemens writes that “of course” entry-level computer programmers earn a lower wage than people with years or even decades more experience, connections and seniority. “That 36 percent entry-level wage gap, which the White House cites as clear evidence that H-1B workers undermine wages, suggests nothing of the kind,” he writes. “It is similar to the wage gap we should expect between all entry-level wages and all average wages—for all kinds of workers, in every firm, in every country, in all of modern history. More experienced workers have more tacit knowledge, have better outside options, and have proven their worth to the firm.”
According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the two versions of the DOL wage rule were among the costliest in the history of modern regulation. The first version of the rule imposed a $165 billion transfer cost on employers over 10 years, and the final rule would have cost employers $105 billion over 10 years.
The Trump administration appears determined to price H-1B visa holders and employment-based immigrants out of the U.S. labor market through immigration policy. Section four of the proclamation requiring the $100,000 fee on H-1B visa holders states, “The Secretary of Labor shall initiate a rulemaking to revise the prevailing wage levels to levels consistent with the policy goals of this proclamation…” (Emphasis added.) By imposing a $100,000 fee, the proclamation aimed to make it too costly for employers to hire high-skilled foreign nationals."

 The boundaries between work life and home life sometimes start to blur. 

 One man is taking a stand against his boss, who doesn't respect his boundaries outside of work hours. In a Reddit post, the man shared that he works in marketing as a contract employee, with his work hours falling between 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. most days.

 “My boss calls me almost every night around 8 or 9 p.m. ‘just to check something quickly,'"" he wrote. ""Sometimes it’s one question, sometimes a 30-minute brainstorming session.""

 The constant calls and work discussions made it so the poster could never fully decompress, so he asked his boss if he could limit their contact after 6 p.m. unless necessary.

 ""Last week, I told him, politely, that I’d rather keep work calls during office hours unless it’s urgent,” the man shared in his post. However, it didn't go as planned.

 ""He said, 'If you want to grow here, you need to be available,'"" he recalled.

 “Now I feel guilty, like I’m being lazy, but I also haven’t had a proper evening off in months,"" he wrote. ""Am I overreacting for wanting an actual boundary, or is this just normal corporate culture now?”

 People in the comments section were sympathetic to the man, agreeing that he should be allowed to set work boundaries.

 “Nah, after hours you shouldn’t have to answer calls/mails.. anything. Even if they come to your house, close the door in their face. Your contract goes from 9-6. If you want to, you can. But you don't have to. I hate bosses like that or colleagues,"" one person commented. 

 Another person pointed out that, in Australia, there's a ""right to disconnect"" law that prevents employers from contacting people off hours. 

 “I recommend against saying anything directly. Just don’t answer calls. When he asks, ‘Oh, sorry, I went to the movies last night. What was urgent?’ (Non-confrontational excuse: he can't get mad at the immediate pivot to the issue, which will change the subject from your lack of answer to the issue, and also subtly highlight how urgent it was or was not.) ‘Oh sorry, I was having dinner with friends and we put our phones away. What was urgent?’ ‘Oh, sorry, I had my phone charging in the other room. What was urgent?' Don’t give him anything to object to,” another person recommended. 

 “If your company has an HR department, report this behavior. Your work does not have to be, nor should it be, your whole life,” a third person suggested.

59,2025-11-02,"When companies change the names of products as part of an upgrade or rebrand, it can be confusing for the consumer. A perfect example is Google TV versus Android TV. While Google TV is essentially the new, upgraded version of Android TV, there are enough differences to warrant a discussion. They're not direct clones and they appear on different devices, often in the same store, since they're both currently on the market. So what's the difference?
Google TV is basically the successor to Android TV, and a marked upgrade. You'll find it in new TCL Google TV models, Google Chromecast devices, and other partnered media gear. Like Android TV, it is Google's operating system for television and media experiences. Both feature Android as the foundation and both are designed specifically for media browsing on the couch. The user interface (UI), options, and settings all serve the use of a TV instead of a mobile device. Which brings up the biggest change — the interface. 
Google TV emphasizes content, with menus that focus on shows and movies to watch and experience, versus the endless list of apps found on Android TVs. Although, it is nice to see the Roku Channel now available on Google TV. You get highlighted recommendations, from all your favorite streaming services, and a cleaner and more enjoyable experience, especially when navigating with a remote. Google TV is considered the better option if you're buying today, but if you already own an Android TV device, there's no need critical reason to upgrade.
Android TVs, at least older versions, were centered around popular apps versus shows and movies to watch. Taking the attention off content can make navigating the UI tedious. Sure, there are some essential Google TV apps you should use on the new platform, but the shift in focus to content is a step in the right direction for Google TV. There are a few other changes that solidify that point. 
Google TV has a renewed focus on Live TV, as Android TV does offer this, but the recommendations and home experiences are now pulling from sources like YouTube TV and Sling TV. You can quickly scan through live channels right on the home screen. Moreover, you can use your phone as a remote with Google TV, and for onscreen keyboards, which makes typing easier. 
As well, there are better parental controls, Google Account service improvements, expanded Gemini AI support, and a swap to the new Google TV app. While these platforms are remarkably similar, and Android TV will continue to be updated to match some of the experiences, the decision between the two is mostly up to preference. If you're buying now, and you want the latest features, go with Google TV. After you buy, be sure to brush up on the hidden features every Google TV user should know."

63,2025-11-02,"Design collective Luso filled a townhouse in Lisbon with works by emerging Portuguese designers and makers to demonstrate how collectible design can coexist with everyday living.
The Collector's Residence was furnished and styled by The Modern Spaces to showcase its Alba development – a former warehouse in the city's Marvila neighbourhood that the real estate company has transformed into a collection of five townhouses.
The Modern Spaces worked with Luso to curate a selection of pieces that highlight some of the key qualities of the residence, which was designed by local architecture practice Quiet Studios.
""We wanted to create something that felt more personal than an exhibition, more of a lived-in space where contemporary Portuguese design could be experienced and not just observed,"" said The Modern Spaces founders, Mathilde Villette and Rafael Alves.
Daylight pouring in through the loft's double-height windows highlighted the textured surfaces of items such AB + AC Architects' forged iron Alma Mater candle holder and an acacia wood lounge chair, made by Luso founders Natacha Grzeskiewicz and Tomàs Fernandes under their design studio Further Ther.
French designer Paul Boucher's monumental table, sculpted from blackened Douglas fir, provided an anchoring presence in the main living area, where it was accompanied by several of Grzeskiewicz's stoneware vases.
The presentation included innovative lighting pieces such as Macheia's floor lamp, featuring an experimental algae-based shade, as well as a minimalist polished-steel lamp by Violaine D'Harcourt.
Softer textures were provided by woven rugs and a room divider by Sofia De Francesco, featuring panels made from recycled paper pulp. These contrasted with the metallic surfaces of furniture pieces by Thayra Correia and Zoé Wolker's faceted Ame pouffe.
The setting in Marvila, a former industrial district, provided an appropriate backdrop for the collectible objects, furniture and lighting from emerging Portuguese designers, chosen to complement the townhouse's raw yet refined character.
""The idea behind the Collector's Residence was to blur the line between gallery and home, allowing each piece to exist in dialogue with real architecture and daily life,"" said Grzeskiewicz and Fernandes.
""It delved into the concept of open-ended placements among the rooms, as if a figurative collector had taken over the residence.""
Villette and Alves told Dezeen that Lisbon's property market has recently begun to stabilise after years of rapid growth, following the launch of Portugal's Golden Visa programme.
But there remains an ongoing tension between the growth of luxury developments and the need to maintain affordability and access for long-time residents.
""Our approach with this project was to collaborate with local talents, who use Portuguese materials, and highlight design that is rooted in Lisbon's identity, hoping to contribute to a conversation about growth that remains thoughtful and sustainable,"" the developers said.

66,2025-11-02,"It's not exactly news to frustrated bitcoin BTC$109,446.77 bulls that risk assets across the planet for months have been recording what seem like daily record highs while the price action in BTC remains rather muted.
""What if everyone is looking at this wrong,"" asks longtime traditional finance asset manager Jordi Visser in a heavily shared (1.5M views on X and counting) weekend essay titled ""Bitcoin’s Silent IPO: Why This Consolidation Isn’t What You Think.""
While bitcoin never had a traditional IPO, the factors liming price gains are nearly exactly the same as those which cause poor price performance in stock IPOs, argues Visser.
Tradfi IPOs and the months that follow, reminds Visser — particularly in tech — are major liquidity events for early investors.
""Early-stage investors take enormous risks,"" wrote Visser. ""If the investment succeeds, they deserve enormous rewards. But eventually, and this is crucial, they need to realize those gains. They need liquidity. They need an exit. They need to diversify.""
The examples, particularly in tech, are legion, but consider the Facebook (now Meta) IPO of 2012. The offering at $38 per share raised $16 billion at a valuation of $104 billion — quaint numbers today, but staggering amounts at the time. One year later, the stock was 30% lower, with pundits questioning Mark Zuckerberg's leadership.
More likely than missteps by Zuck, it was early investors — be they his Harvard buddies, or Silicon Valley types, or the carpenters who framed out Facebook's first offices (who took pay in shares rather than cash) — using public markets to realize life-changing profits.
Importantly, says Visser, the early investors don't hit the bid all at once. ""They’re methodically distributing their positions. They’re being careful. They don’t want to crater the price. They’re patient. They’ve waited years for this moment. They can wait a few more months to do it right.""
The result, he says: ""A sideways grind that drives everyone crazy."" Sound familiar?
""The on-chain data tells a clear story if you know how to read it,"" says Visser, turning to bitcoin. ""Old coins, coins that haven’t moved in years, some dormant since the single-digit price days, are suddenly active.""
The ETFs, the institutional adoption, the friendly regulatory environment ... this created IPO-like conditions for bitcoin's early believers.
""For years, the liquidity simply didn’t exist,"" he wrote. ""Try selling $100 million of bitcoin in 2015. You’d crater the price. Try selling $1 billion in 2019. Same problem. The market couldn’t absorb it.""
""But now,"" he continued. ""ETFs are providing institutional bid. Major companies hold bitcoin on their balance sheets. Sovereign wealth funds are getting involved. The market has finally matured to the point where early holders can exit significant positions without causing chaos.""
Again, reminds Visser, it's not being done all at once — no one is interested in crashing the price. But instead, steadily and methodically: hence the sideways grind and the rallies that reverse so quickly.
What's occurring now is hardly anything that can be called a bear market, says Visser, but instead a distribution of ownership.
Over the long run, this is a bullish event, but the process — at least in traditional markets — can take 6-18 months. Even though cycles often get sped up in crypto, Visser suspects there could be many more months of this frustrating price action in bitcoin.
""Sentiment will only improve after the distribution is substantially complete,"" he wrote. ""People are demoralized because they don’t understand what phase we’re in. They’re waiting for bitcoin to 'catch up' to stocks. They are worried about the four year cycle. Be patient. Once the heavy selling pressure lifts, once the patient accumulation by institutions has absorbed the OG supply, the path becomes clearer.""

78,2025-11-02,"I’ve been a fan of Moto Gestures from the beginning. Everyone knows how to turn on the flashlight on a     Motorola smartphone by chopping in midair, but there are other useful functions.    
Picking up the phone silences an incoming call, and I think it’s fantastic that I can put my Moto in Do Not Disturb mode by simply placing the device face down.
I’ve never been able to get the figure-eight just right to bring up the camera app, but it’s there for people who like quick access for in-the-moment photos.
However, physical gestures aren’t the only ones that help you get more from your Motorola.
Navigational gestures also make me more productive. My favorite gesture isn’t even turned on by default, but more people need to know about it.
If you enjoy multitasking on your Moto phone, make this switch, and you’ll love your device even more.
 Multitasking isn’t an amazing experience on most Android phones.
The ability to create and save app pairs has certainly helped, but I want to pull up two apps in the shortest amount of time, and I don’t want to be bound by app pairs I’ve already put together.
Fortunately, Moto has a gesture that simplifies the process: Swipe to split.
When enabled, you can swipe back and forth across the screen to bring up multitasking. It immediately splits the app you’re using and gives you a chance to pull up a second app.
It’s a fantastic feature if I’m on WhatsApp or Google Messages and someone asks me about a calendar event. I can stay in the chat while getting the information I need.
It’s a little tricky at first and takes some getting used to. You need to make sure you’ve activated the back gesture by swiping left to right across the screen and then back again.
If you don’t feel the haptics and the tug of the back gesture, it’s not going to work.
When you get used to it, it’s amazing, and I’ve been using it more than I thought I would.
 Hello UI doesn’t typically rank high on my list of Android versions, but that’s not a bad thing.
It’s unoffensive and doesn’t bog down the user experience with too many unnecessary features.
I wouldn’t say it’s stock Android, but it’s not a bloated mess either. I could do without the Moto AI functions, but the rest is clean and runs smoothly.
I wish Motorola would offer better software support for its devices, but I wouldn’t expect that anytime soon.
I don’t know when Android 16 will ship, and it wouldn’t surprise me if it doesn’t arrive until we’re closer to receiving Android 17 from Google. It’s a frustrating part of liking Motorola phones, but thankfully, there are other benefits.
 Moto Gestures encapsulate Motorola perfectly. They’re simple, effective, and add value to the products.
I understand the Motorola Razr line can get pricey, but one of my favorite phones this year is the base     Motorola Razr 2025. It can often be found on sale or with a carrier discount for under $500, making it a fantastic bargain.    
The     Moto G Stylus 2025 is also excellent and can be purchased for under $350 if you find the right deal. It features a capable Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 chipset and 8GB of RAM, ensuring a smooth multitasking experience on the G Stylus.    
It’s hard to find a bad value in the Motorola lineup, and Moto Gestures are the icing on the cake.
I never read manuals. I enjoy jumping right into a new product and figuring things out as I go along. However, it’s easy to overlook helpful new features and functions.
I don’t know why Swipe to split isn’t enabled by default, but it’s a setting every Motorola owner should check.
Motorola's most affordable Razr gets a glow-up for 2025. With new colors, a more powerful processor, and all sorts of AI tools, this might be the most exciting $700 folding phone you've ever seen.

Daihatsu recently took to the Japan Mobility Show to showcase some of the fascinating vehicles it’s building in the small segment. Personally speaking, small cars are incredibly difficult to pull off with all the features and functionalities, let alone the idea of stuffing them with features to fit the camper segment. But that’s what Daihatsu continues to take up as a challenge for itself, which is evident in the showcase of the Toyota Daihatsu Kayoibako-K concept.
The adorable micro-transporter is showcased in various possible variants, including a camper van, a small family hauler, and as a self-driving adventurer and mobile delivery van. While the concept vehicle is not fully autonomous, the Kayoibako-K concept has been depicted in promotional videos as navigating itself to the driver’s doorsteps, driving autonomously on specific routes, or returning autonomously to its parking spot after a long day of work.
Designer: Daihatsu







Even though, for those who have been following Toyota’s vision of the micro-van, there wouldn’t be much to distinguish between the Kayoibako-K and the original Kayoibako concept the company showcased at the Japan Mobility Show, two years back in 2023, but the adorable micro-camper is skimmed down in size further to be more adaptable to city roads. Kayoibako is a name Toyota has picked from the name deriving from shipping containers in Japanese, which rely on modular interiors to haul different types of cargo. On similar lines, the Kayoibako-K is a compact concept van and mini-camper, is basically a single vehicle (a platform) that features interchangeable interiors for versatility and enhanced scope of use.







According to the press information received, Kayoibako-K van measures almost 3,395mm, 1,475 mm wide, and 1,475 mm high. It can accommodate 4 people, and is designed to pull off everything from last-mile deliveries in local communities to camping beyond the cityscapes, in of course what is the smallest mini vehicle form factor ever in the mini vehicle-sized commercial vehicles. In the camper version, this little vehicle puts on a roof tent accessible by a ladder, and off-road tires for traveling some unpaved roads on the way to the campsite.


Even though camping has its versatile functionality, the Kayoibako-K is primarily conceptualized with a large rear cabin for delivering packages. The van can work as a mobile storefront, used to carry tools, and even be used, if you may, as a cab to transport elderly passengers in an urban road setting. However, it’s the camper van feature of the Kayoibako-K that impresses me. The van is shown to feature a two-person rooftop tent, and can also be used to haul your gear, including a kayak, to the beach. There is no word on when or if the concept micro camper van will hit the market, but if and when it does, it will definitely slay the onlooker with its graphic detailing and blinky-like headlamps.

The Ford F-150 is the most popular truck in the world, and it has been for years. Right now, however, the current model year trucks just aren’t selling as well as expected.
In order to try to clear them off the lot for next year’s models, Ford is offering some great financing deals, which are discussed in detail in this TikTok video.
The TikToker began her video by saying, “Ford is apparently struggling to sell the F-150s, so if you have a low credit score, this might be a good chance for you to get one.”
What are they offering?
TikTok/maiehaven
She goes on, “Ford just announced a new offer.” Then she says, “That will give people with low credit scores, for example, with 620 or lower, the same interest rates as someone with an excellent credit score. But this does only apply to the F-150 models.
Low interest rates can save you thousands of dollars over the life of the loan.
TikTok/maiehaven
Then the TikToker says, “Now, Ford says that this is so that they can extend offers to higher-risk customers, and to boost sales.”
In addition, she says, “It’s also important to note that this offer is not available to just anyone because you have a low credit score, you do still have to meet the income requirements in order to make the payments.”
This is very reasonable.
TikTok/maiehaven
The video ends with her saying, “All in all, this does say a lot about where the current car market stands.”
Ford must be getting desperate to sell those cars. I wonder if it will work.
The F150s are really nice trucks.
Check out the full video below to see if this is a deal that might work out well for you.

The people in the comments seem to think the base price is the problem.
This person says financing is not the issue.

Here is someone who is going to just wait for the market to crash.

This would be a lot easier.

Good financing can save you tons of money.

With the conclusion of the World Series comes the start of MLB free agency, and this year's class is ripe with needle-moving talent for teams hoping to challenge for next year's pennant.
Here are the top 10 upcoming MLB free agents:
Kyle Schwarber has led the National League in home runs in two of the last four seasons. (Photo by Ronald Martinez/Getty Images) 
2025 Stats (Regular Season): 56 home runs, 132 RBIs, 4.7 WAR and .240/.365/.563 slash line (604 at-bats)
When there's a power outage, you call Schwarber to get the lights back on. The left-handed hitting slugger has overwhelming power, exemplified by his hitting 56 home runs this season and ranking in the top three percent of MLB in average exit velocity in each of the last two seasons. 
One could argue that the 32-year-old Schwarber still has three more prime years left in the tank, and, at the top of his game, the level, compact-swinging star hitter should command a starting salary that begins with the No. 4, if not the No. 5.
Kyle Tucker is a four-time All-Star. (Photo by Geoff Stellfox/Getty Images) 
2025 Stats (Regular Season): 22 home runs, 73 RBIs, 25 stolen bases, 4.5 WAR and .266/.377/.464 slash line (500 at-bats)
Tucker is one of the best outfielders that the sport has to offer. Now, calf and shin injuries, respectively, have limited the outfielder's availability over the past two years. That said, this is a Gold Glove right fielder who hits for slug, seldom strikes out and is still just 28. 
A long-term investment in Tucker, who has been an All-Star in each of the past four seasons, is an investment in one of the game's best all-around players and a left-handed hitting star who has played in numerous big-time postseason games, particularly in his seven seasons with the Houston Astros.
Bo Bichette led the American League in hits in both 2021 and 2022. (Photo by Cole Burston/Getty Images) 
2025 Stats (Regular Season): 18 home runs, 94 RBIs, 3.4 WAR and .311/.357/.483 slash line (582 at-bats)
Want a star shortstop who's about to enter the prime of his career? Bo Bichette is for you. Bichette, who will be on Toronto's World Series roster after missing seven weeks due to a knee injury, is an explosive right-handed hitter, an extra-base hitting machine and a steady force at shortstop. Bichette, a two-time All-Star, is a career .294 hitter who wreaks havoc at the top of the order. 
A long-term investment in Bichette is a prudent play for any team needing a fixture at the middle-infield position.
Alex Bregman boasts a career 43.1 WAR. (Photo by Al Bello/Getty Images) 
2025 Stats (Regular Season): 18 home runs, 62 RBIs, 3.5 WAR and .273/.360/.462 slash line (433 at-bats)
Plug-and-play-and-go. That's what Bregman will give any team that he signs with. While Bregman is coming off a season where he was limited by a quad injury, the third baseman remains one of the premier infielders in the sport. He's slick at the hot corner, hits for both contact and power and is a proven force in the postseason. 
Opting out of a $40 million average annual salary, Bregman should be able to fetch a salary north of $30 million per season on a long-term deal.
Framber Valdez boasts a career 3.36 ERA. (Photo by Alex Slitz/Getty Images) 
2025 Stats (Regular Season): 3.66 ERA, 1.25 WHIP, 187 strikeouts, 3.8 WAR and 114 ERA+ in 192.0 innings pitched (31 starts)
While he's had some postseason issues in recent years, Valdez is a proven, top-of-the-rotation force. Houston's most consistent starting pitcher over the last five years, the southpaw pitches deep into games, posts strikeouts at a plausible rate and evades damage. Valdez, who heavily leans on his sinker and curveball, gives any pitching staff that he potentially joins credibility, a potent starter and a proven commodity. He's an ace.
Pete Alonso is first in Mets history with 264 career home runs. (Photo by Ishika Samant/Getty Images) 
2025 Stats (Regular Season): 38 home runs, 126 RBIs, 3.4 WAR and .272/.347/.524 slash line (624 at-bats)
Alonso and the Mets look poised for another offseason of hardball contract negotiations. And if that narrative indeed continues into the winter, it gives any team in need of an elite power catalyst the chance to swoop in and sign the five-time All-Star. Alonso, who has averaged 39 home runs and 115.8 RBIs per season since 2021 and finished in the 96th percentile in MLB in average exit velocity, hard-hit percentage and barrel percentage this season, is among the most intimidating hitters in the sport.
Boasting a career .516 slugging percentage, he'd move the needle for any team looking for power production.
Ranger Suarez owns a combined 3.33 ERA over the last two seasons. (Photo by Ronald Martinez/Getty Images) 
2025 Stats (Regular Season): 3.20 ERA, 1.22 WHIP, 151 strikeouts, 4.7 WAR and 137 ERA+ in 157.1 innings pitched (26 starts)
Suarez has emerged as one of the best starting pitchers in the sport over the last two years. Commanding a consistent, five-pitch arsenal (sinker, changeup, cutter, curveball and four-seamer), Suarez has been able to pitch deep into games (he pitched through the seventh inning in nine of 26 starts this season), induce weak contact and, at his best, has arguably been Philadelphia's No. 1 starting pitcher. The left-hander's problem has been back issues, which stunted his 2024 campaign and delayed the start of his 2025 campaign.
Only making 53 starts over the past two years is primarily what prevents the 30-year-old Suarez from being higher on this list.
Cody Bellinger has posted an OPS north of .800 in two of the last three seasons. (Photo by Ishika Samant/Getty Images) 
2025 Stats (Regular Season): 29 home runs, 98 RBIs, 5.0 WAR and .272/.334/.480 slash line (588 at-bats)
Bellinger does it all. The two-time All-Star started at all three outfield positions for the Yankees this season, while being able to play first base, possessing reputable power and drastically reducing his strikeouts in recent years. Bellinger's 5.0 WAR this season was his highest mark since posting 8.7 WAR in his 2019 MVP season. One knock on Bellinger, though, is that he hasn't built on a promising or All-Star-caliber season at the plate.
The back-and-forth career offensive tendencies of Bellinger could result in him signing a three-year deal instead of a five or six-year deal, which was the length of his previous contract.
Eugenio Suarez has averaged 32.6 home runs per season since 2021. (Photo by Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images) 
2025 Stats (Regular Season): 49 home runs, 118 RBIs, 3.6 WAR and .228/.298/.526 slash line (588 at-bats)
Suarez swings a hammer, and combining the regular season and postseason, the third baseman blasted 52 home runs in 2025. Now, he does strike out at a high rate. At the same time, his power outweighs the whiffs, as Suarez is one of the most intimidating power threats in the sport and finished in the 89th percentile of MLB in barrel percentage this season (14.3%). 
A veteran presence at third base, the 34-year-old Suarez figures to cash in on a hefty, three-to-four-year deal.
Josh Naylor totaled a career-high in home runs (31) and RBIs (108) in 2024. (Photo by Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images) 
2025 Stats (Regular Season): 20 home runs, 92 RBIs, 30 stolen bases, 3.1 WAR and .295/.353/.462 slash line (543 at-bats)
Naylor has come into his own as one of the best first basemen in the game. He has a level, compact swing from the left side that generates power and is a respectable defensive presence at the corner infield position. After landing in Seattle this past summer through a trade from the Arizona Diamondbacks, Naylor was a force to be reckoned with in the postseason, blasting three home runs and posting a .340/.392/.574 slash line. 
Entering the prime of his career, Naylor presents a savvy, long-term investment at first base.

October was supposed to be the month when long-awaited crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) finally hit U.S. markets. Deadlines for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve or deny several spot crypto ETF applications were lined up throughout the month. But when the U.S. government shut down, the process froze — and deadlines stopped mattering.
Now November could take October’s place. Several issuers are using a procedural route that doesn’t require an active SEC sign-off. It’s the same approach that allowed four crypto ETFs — two from Canary Capital, one from Bitwise and one from Grayscale — to start trading earlier this week despite the regulatory paralysis.
Issuers are filing updated S-1 registration statements that include “no delaying amendment” language. Under U.S. securities law, those filings automatically become effective after 20 days unless the SEC steps in to issue a stay or request changes. For the four ETFs that listed this week, the SEC didn’t act, allowing them to go live by default.
That success has sparked a wave of new filings. On Thursday, Fidelity submitted an updated S-1 for its spot Solana ETF, and Canary Capital did the same for its XRP ETF. If the SEC continues to follow its current track and doesn’t block the process, the market could see its first XRP fund as soon as November 13.
Still, there are limits to how far this workaround can go. While the SEC has already reviewed filings tied to Solana, HBAR and Litecoin ETFs, it hasn’t engaged much with the XRP application — a gap that could prompt the agency to halt its automatic approval.
“I think it’s possible we see a bunch of the funds launch next month. And that could be true whether or not the government reopens. But there are funds with filings that simply have not yet received any feedback from the SEC on their S-1s (prospectuses) and I’m not sure that they can launch without the SEC getting back to work,” said James Seyffart, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “So yes a bunch will likely launch next month but there are some that are simply unlikely to launch without the government reopening.”
For investors, the shift marks a new phase in the yearslong effort to bring crypto ETFs to U.S. markets. Instead of waiting for the SEC’s formal blessing, issuers are using procedural mechanics to move forward. Whether that momentum carries through November may depend less on market readiness — and more on whether the government gets back to work.

Saturday Night Live star Michael Che condemned the hatred being stoked by President Donald Trump’s supporters against recipients of SNAP benefits, also known as “food stamps.”
In a fiery Instagram post, Che wrote, “This SNAP freeze is really f---ed up. and I keep seeing a lotta racist videos celebrating (mostly black) families not being able to buy groceries.. theres this weird idea that since some people have taken advantage of welfare benefits in the hood, NOBODY should receive help, at all..?“
Che continued, “this country is built on greedy motherf----rs taking shortcuts and gaming the system to their benefit, but for some reason, when poor people find a way to turn nickel into a dime, they’re judged more severely, especially blacks. i kno the whole hustle is to hate each other here so we can fight in the comments and up our engagements. But lets draw the line at feeding the poor.”
“I grew up on free cheese and powdered milk and waiting for your friends to leave the store so they wont see me pay with stamps. that s--t ain’t as glamorous as it sounds. i promise,” he wrote. 
It was a rare somber moment from Che, who has served as SNL‘s “Weekend Update” co-anchor alongside Colin Jost since 2014, after joining the show as a writer the year prior. 
A post shared by Michael Che (@chethinks)
The Department of Agriculture, which oversees the SNAP program, has warned that because of the government shutdown, the program’s 42 million recipients may not receive benefits after Saturday, although the president has said he will fund the program if given “the appropriate legal direction.” 
Two federal judges have ruled that the government cannot suspend SNAP benefits, with both requesting updates on the restoration of funding by no later than Monday.
Meanwhile, numerous videos claiming to feature SNAP recipients “gaming the system” and complaining about losing their source of income have gone viral in recent weeks, drawing ire from conservatives who have been quick to use the videos as proof of undeserving SNAP recipients. Almost all of these videos, which are likely the ones Che is referring to in his post, feature Black individuals.
Fox News contributor Brett Cooper posted a video reacting to several of those videos, responding to one by saying, “This is insane. You’re telling me that it is my responsibility to make sure that your children are fed?”
However, the majority of clips conservatives have seized upon are not real: many of the videos were made with OpenAI’s Sora 2 video generator, and designed to play into racist stereotypes about people who receive SNAP benefits. 
OpenAI, which was originally co-founded by Elon Musk and is currently overseen by CEO Sam Altman, did not immediately return a request for comment.
AI rage bait is easy #ebt #governmentshutdown #fyp #sora #news AI videos and rage bait are a perfect match - no shame or accountability, anonymity, and no friction.
The AI videos also provided cover to politicians like GOP congressman Clay Higgins, who told SNAP recipients to “stop smoking crack” if they couldn’t figure out how to stock their pantries on $4,200, an amount he claimed was what the average SNAP family receives in a year.
A report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that the average benefit per person is $188 per month, or $6.17 per day—almost half of the number Higgins claimed. With food prices rising by more than 23 percent since 2020, the average American now spends more than $900 on groceries each month.
Fox News also reported on the videos, initially publishing an article with the headline, “SNAP beneficiaries threaten to ransack stores over government shutdown.”
After learning that the videos were AI-generated, it changed the headline to, “AI videos of SNAP beneficiaries complaining about cuts go viral” and added an editor’s note that read, “This article previously reported on some videos that appear to have been generated by AI without noting that. This has been corrected.”
Not sure if I’ve seen anything like this before — Fox feel for an AI video and basically rewrote their whole story when called out  https://t.co/L7bVMpb4Dw pic.twitter.com/tr0XgzCSQX
While Republicans wait for permission to feed the 42 million Americans who receive food stamps, food pantries across the country are seeing significantly longer lines than usual. One food pantry in New York City, Che’s hometown, saw 200 more people than average lining up for basic necessities on Saturday.
The USDA website currently displays a notice that reads, “Senate Democrats have now voted 13 times to not fund the food stamp program, also known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Bottom line, the well has run dry. At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01.“
The message goes on to repeat MAGA talking points, reading, “We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. They can continue to hold out for healthcare for illegal aliens and gender mutilation procedures or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive critical nutrition assistance.”

The note-taking conversation is usually dominated by the likes of OneNote, Evernote, Notion, and Obsidian.
However, a small, fiercely capable application is quietly achieving what the giants often complicate: perfect organization. That app is Bundled Notes.
This Android powerhouse delivers a robust, flexible, and surprisingly intuitive system.
If you have ever felt overwhelmed by feature bloat or frustrated by the limitations of the current market leaders, prepare to discover the minimalist tool that might be the last note-taking app you ever download.
Bundled Notes has nailed the app aesthetics.
If you have spent any time in the note-taking heavyweights lately, you know the vibe: OneNote feels heavy, Evernote is clunky and overloaded with legacy code, and Notion often feels like a slow-loading web page.
And don’t even get me started on Obsidian. Powerful, yes, but its UI is strictly basic at best. That’s why the release of Bundled Notes 4.0 is such a game-changer.
The developer didn’t just tweak a thing or two; they literally rewrote the core from scratch (using modern tech like Jetpack Compose, for the tech-savvy among us).
It’s pure Android fluidity. This is where Bundled Notes truly beats the giants. The whole experience feels native. It’s polished, modern, and perfectly aligned with Material You dynamic theming.
With the legacy code cleaned out, the app feels blazing fast. Even when switching between my complex Kanban boards or filtering massive Bundles by tags, there is zero friction.
The new Kanban board UI in v4.0 deserves special mention. Dragging and dropping notes between columns is silky smooth, and the side-scrolling experience is far superior to trying to manage a long list of cards in a cramped vertical feed.
Bundled Notes isn’t just a pretty face; it’s feature-rich. It manages to pack in power features without the typical bloat, which is why I consider it a genuine giant-slayer.
It takes the simplicity of Google Keep and adds serious features to turn it into an ultimate productivity tool.
Bundled Notes offers a full, integrated, live Markdown editor. That means I can quickly write a heading, make text bold, or create checklists, and the note renders it beautifully.
It’s perfect for everything from drafting blog posts to structuring detailed meeting notes.
Unlike Evernote, which can sometimes feel like a heavy word processor, the Bundled Notes editor is light and fast.
It includes all the essentials: headings, quotes, code blocks, and lists, accessible through a simple toolbar when I need it.
Kanban board is where Bundled Notes elevates itself from a simple note-taker to a dedicated lightweight project manager, easily surpassing the basic checklist functionality of almost every competitor.
I can take any single Bundle and activate the Kanban view. It uses my existing tags and automatically creates columns.
Bundled Notes understands that I need tags that are more than just simple labels (looking at you, Google Keep). Since tags are contained within a specific Bundle, I can reuse general tags like #urgent without cluttering my main, global tag list.
Beyond the core note-taking experience, Bundled Notes includes all the essential extras I expect from a modern productivity app.
I can attach photos and videos directly to my notes, set reminders for important notes, and even play with the dozens of customization options.
One of the biggest mistakes people make when choosing a note app is thinking it’s only for quick thoughts. Bundled Notes isn’t just a note app; it’s a toolkit for managing my entire digital life.
The brilliance of the Bundle system is that it allows the app to be radically different things in different contexts, all under one roof.
I no longer need a separate app for tasks, reading lists, and long-form notes. I simply create a new Bundle and customize its layout.
For example, I set a Bundle to use the Kanban board view, where notes become draggable cards across my Backlog, Doing, and Done columns.
It’s the perfect lightweight replacement for Trello or Notion databases, handled right in my notes app.
I use a separate Bundle purely for long-form writing or collecting web links. I enable the rich text editor, set the view to a dense list, and my Markdown notes look exactly like published articles.
I also have a Bundle for Movies/TV where I use colorful tags and link previews, and create my personal, visual database of things I want to watch.
For desktop users (which I’m often), the web application is essential, and it’s robust.
The verdict is in: while Google Keep offers speed and Evernote offers sheer archival volume, Bundled Notes delivers the perfect balance of structure and function for the modern organizer.
For the Android user tired of digital noise, this app proves that focusing on fewer, better-designed features can easily beat volume.
Overall, if you value a focused, beautiful, and highly capable note-taking experience on Android, I can’t recommend Bundled Notes enough.
If Bundled Notes doesn’t work for you, check out these note-taking apps to fly through your ideas.

In light of the government shutdown, the media’s focus has been the expiration of the Affordable Care Act subsidies and what to do about them, as well as the financing of Medicaid. But what hasn’t gotten much attention is the fact that federal and state tax systems provide substantial financial benefits for individuals with commercial health insurance. This is particularly the case for the 165 million Americans who get coverage through their employers. Employer-paid health insurance premiums are tax-free for employees and count as a subsidy and a tax expenditure. And employers can typically deduct 100% of the premiums they pay for employee health insurance as a business expense. Whether such government involvement in healthcare markets is necessarily a good thing is a topic of ongoing debate.
The most prevalent form of health insurance coverage in America is subsidized in absolute dollars to a substantially greater extent than Obamacare. The exclusion from income and payroll taxes of employer and employee contributions for employer-sponsored insurance represents the largest tax subsidy in the healthcare market. And as KFF explains, because this isn’t reported to the individuals and families who benefit from it, they might not be aware of the tax exclusions that on average provide them with a subsidy worth several thousands of dollars annually.
In reference to the discussion on the future of ACA premium tax credits, Larry Levitt, KFF’s Executive Vice President for Health Policy, tweeted “I wonder how many people realize that the federal government spent $384 billion last year providing a tax subsidy for employer-provided health benefits, with higher income people getting bigger subsidies.”
Additionally, Medicaid is paid for by state and federal governments. And Medicare is heavily funded by the federal government. This includes both traditional Medicare and privately administered Medicare Advantage. While the latter isn’t run by the government, it owes its existence and profitability (through generous subsidies) to the federal government. And then there are additional tax breaks which the government grants, such as the ability of self-employed individuals to claim the premiums they pay for health insurance as a tax deduction.
KFF analysis reveals that healthcare accounted for 27% of overall federal spending in 2024. Federal monies support health insurance programs such as Medicaid and Medicare directly. And the government assists the commercial employer-sponsored healthcare insurance sector and the ACA exchanges indirectly through tax subsidies. The former cost the government roughly $384 billion in 2024; the latter, $111 billion.
Employer-provided coverage is by far the single largest source of health insurance for Americans. And it’s been this way for many decades. In the 1940s, employers began to offer health benefits to attract workers. Federal regulators subsequently made employer-sponsored coverage tax-exempt while employees receive these benefits tax-free, further encouraging its adoption.
Employer plans pool risk, setting premiums based on the collective health profile of employees. This can result in lower costs per person. In addition, the insurance offerings vary from high-deductible plans with lower premiums to comprehensive options with broader provider networks and minimal out-of-pocket expenses.
The average family health insurance plan is estimated to now cost $27,000, up from $6,438 in 2000. The amount contributed by workers has spiked from around $1,600 in 2000 to more than $6,400 in 2025.
Perhaps the federal government’s tax structure in the employer-sponsored sector is impeding effective cost control. This could result in regulatory capture which happens when a government agency intending to act as a benefactor to the public instead appears to favor the interests of the industries it regulates.
Nevertheless, there are valid reasons for the government to intervene in healthcare, whether in the commercial or public sectors. The healthcare space is qualitatively different from other markets and prone to market failure or the lack of viable markets altogether. Market failure refers to situations where market mechanisms fail to achieve an efficient allocation of resources; this can manifest itself in unequal access to healthcare services, inefficient allocation of resources and poor healthcare outcomes. For one thing, there are very high levels of uncertainty, starting with consumers making choices about insurance to cover future health events. There’s also asymmetric information, which means, for instance, that doctors know (much) more about what to prescribe than the patient. And third-party payments shield patients from the actual costs of treatment.
Nobel-prize winning economist, Kenneth Arrow, famously wrote in 1963 “it follows that the government should undertake insurance in those cases where this market, for whatever reason, has failed to emerge.” Libertarians dispute whether Arrow really intended for the government to intervene. Regardless, practically no-one questions the existence of market failures in healthcare, just the remedies for them.
While government intervention seems a logical step to correct for market failures, free market advocates make the point that government action can bring with it unintended consequences. Every stakeholder has a financial interest in the business of healthcare, but also in winning government largesse in the form of tax-preferential policies. Those with vested interests include, among others, insurers, hospitals and drug makers. Each wants a piece of the fiscal and profit pies.
Profit-seeking behavior itself isn’t necessarily problematic as it generally works towards everyone’s benefit in most sectors of a smoothly operating capitalist economy, as Adam Smith first described 250 years ago. But in healthcare the markets are riddled with imperfections and opacity to begin with. Throw in a system rife with special interest-driven rules and regulations that often don’t cohere and favor one group over another, and you’ve got a recipe for trouble."

Whenever I go on a work trip, I'm always faced with the same problem: reduced productivity that comes from working on a small laptop screen rather than my usual 49-inch display at home.
Portable monitors can help make me more efficient while away, but only if they meet a certain level of quality and convenience. Over the last few days, I've been using the JSAUX FlipGo Horizon Pro portable dual monitors while connected to my laptop.
These screens can be magnetically placed onto a stand that extends to either side of the laptop in portrait or landscape mode. These displays can also be stacked, or I can choose to only use one of them at a time.
While I love the idea of this accessory and did find that it helped increase my work efficiency on a laptop, there are a few ways in which the FlipGo Horizon Pro monitors could be improved.
I've spent the last nine years testing and reviewing various tech. My experience allows me to determine when a device is built well and whether or not it's worth spending your hard-earned money on. 
This review was made possible thanks to a review sample provided by JSAUX. The company had no input nor saw the contents of this review prior to publication.
In case you don't already know, JSAUX is a brand that creates laptop and gaming accessories. I've reviewed several peripherals from this company over the years and often recommend them to my friends and family.
• Starting price: $499.00 at JSAUX• Size: 15.6-inch 16:9• Resolution: 1920 x 1080• Refresh rate: 60Hz• Color gamut: 100% sRGB (82% sRGB in testing)• Brightness: 300nits (250nits in testing)• Ports (per monitor): 1x mini HDMI, 1x USB-C with display support, 1x USB-C PD Power Input• Snap Stand Pro ports: 2x USB-C Gen 2, 3x USB 3.1 Gen 1, 1x USB-C PD, 1x USB-C upstream, 1x Ethernet• Power supply: Supports reverse charging• Size: 293 x 172 x 14mm (11.5 x 6.77 x 0.55in)• Weight: 820g (1.81 pounds)
The company's latest FlipGo Horizon Pro dual monitors have a starting price of $499.00 at JSAUX, and this purchase is composed of several components, depending on the version you select.
When I opened the box, I found that the two JSAUX FlipGo Horizon monitors come with a shoulder strap, universal adapters, an outlet charger, four USB-C cables, two mini HDMI cables, the adjustable Snap Stand Pro, instructions for how to use the stand, a phone stand adapter with MagSafe attachment, manuals, two hex keys, a carrying case for just the monitors, and then a larger carrying case for everything.There are various slots within the main carrying case intended for these specific accessories, but some accessories (like cables) also share slots.
 



Basically, it comes with a lot of accessories and thus gives you everything you need to connect the two monitors to a compatible laptop with either two USB-C ports that support display, two HDMI ports, or a mixture of the two. Really, whatever works best for you.
Enlarge your workspace by adding two portable screens to your laptop. They can be positioned horizontally or vertically to meet your needs. 👉 See at: JSAUX.com
 



While not perfect, the FlipGo Horizon offers one of the best ways to tote additional laptop screens around on the go.
I love the flexibility it gives me to work in landscape mode, portrait mode, a mixture of the two, stacked landscape mode, or in solo display mode. Whether I'm working in spreadsheets or playing a video game, I can find the setup that works best for me in that moment.
There are two square indentations on the backs of either monitor, and these attach magnetically to square-shaped blocks on the metal stand. In my experience, these magnets held the displays sturdy enough, but it sometimes took a minute or so to get the slots lined up.
The panels support a crisp 1920 x 1080 resolution and reach up to 60Hz for a good viewing experience overall.
These definitely aren't the best screens on the market when it comes to color accuracy or brightness. They reached only 80% of sRGB, 62% of AdobeRGB, 61% of P3, and a pitiful max brightness of 250 nits in my colorimeter testing.
However, the panels support a crisp 1920 x 1080 resolution and reach up to 60Hz for a good viewing experience overall, at least for a portable monitor. Unless you're doing creative work and need a better color gamut, this should meet most people's work needs.
When it comes time to connect the monitors to your laptop, you get the choice of using your laptop's USB-C display port or an HDMI port.
Three of the four included USB-C cables have a right-angle connection on one side and a typical straight USB-C on the other, which can help hide some of the cables and keep things looking tidier. I also love that passthrough charging reduces the total number of outlet charging cables needed for this laptop setup.
By pressing the menu button on the side of a monitor, I can adjust screen brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, blue light settings, and more. It's all rather easy to do and responsive too.
When it comes to traveling, the hard shell carrying case adds a lot of convenience with its handle and specific indentations for various accessories. I especially appreciate that the monitors are kept within their own separate zippered hard shell case with a soft lining to protect them from getting damaged in transit.
As you might expect, the carrying case is rather heavy when everything is inside, due to the metal stand and monitors. Its large size also means that you might need to plan how to pack this carrying case into your luggage on work trips.
It would have been nicer if the carrying case had a shoulder strap in addition to the handle.
 



While it's nice being able to use the screens in so many modes, it can sometimes feel tedious getting everything set up. That's because the stand needs to be set up in different ways to make the different orientations possible, and these positions aren't exactly straightforward.
JSAUX does provide a handy illustrated guide to help with this, but it can still take a while to get things set up correctly. On top of that, the stacked mode requires me to pull out a small, foldout kickstand that likely won't be sturdy on certain uneven surfaces.
Stacked mode requires me to pull out a small, foldout kickstand that likely won't be sturdy on certain uneven surfaces.
I also experienced some potential laptop incompatibility issues.
During my testing, I was initially sent a prelaunch version of the FlipGo Pro and connected the monitors to my HP OmniBook X laptop. For some reason, one of the prelaunch displays would flicker, and if I went into Windows settings to change anything, the display would change to black and white and only show up on half of the panel. This issue didn't go away even after troubleshooting and restarting the laptop multiple times.
When I connected that same prelaunch monitor to my Lenovo Legion 9i laptop, it didn't have the same black and white half-screen issue, but it did flicker quite a bit.
However, when I attached my phone to the display, there was no flickering at all.
I notified JSAUX of this issue, and I was told the flickering could be due to the device incorrectly sensing the laptop's resolution. The company then sent me the finalized version of the product to see if it had the same issues.
Thankfully, I didn't see these same problems when testing the final product, so hopefully it has been resolved.
There is definitely room for some improvement, however, the JSAUX FlipGo Horizon and its Snap Stand Pro do provide plenty of convenience and make me a better multitasker when working on a laptop.
Thanks to the included accessories and hard shell cases, it's easy to tote these dual screens around, whether I'm going on a day trip or traveling to another state for work. I'd prefer it if the carrying case had a shoulder strap and you'll wan to make sure you don't throw away the illustrated stand instructions, since the stand can be confusing to use.
In the end, I was able to be more productive while working on my laptop thanks to these handy screens that I can place in whatever orientation serves my needs best.
 




Add two portable screens to your laptop with this travel accessory. The displays can be placed horizontally or vertically to best fit your specific situation. These displays come in a hard-shell protective carrying case, making them perfect for travel. 
The FlipGo Horizon and its adjustable stand can work with a wide range of laptops, including ones with both smaller and larger displays. It is possible there might be some connectivity issues with some models.
As with any purchase, that depends on how you intend to use it. If you travel a lot or work from a laptop and want to be more productive, its added screens can certainly be beneficial to your workload. If you don't need screens that can be used both horizontally and vertically, then you might be good with a different option.

Contrary to popular belief, oil prices aren’t determined by any one country, company, or cartel. Instead, they’re the product of a global tug-of-war among producers, traders, and policymakers. It’s a market defined by not just by physics, but by psychology, where the actions of a few key players can ripple across the world in a matter of hours.
On November 2nd, OPEC+ announced a modest 137,000 barrel-per-day production increase for December, following by a pause on further increases in the first quarter of 2026. The move surprised many analysts who expected continued restraint. On the surface, boosting supply when prices are already under pressure seems counterintuitive. But this is not a move driven by near-term pricing. It’s a move about market share, and about power.
As Morningstar aptly summarized, “defending market share now outweighs defending prices.” That’s a telling statement, and it signals a familiar shift in strategy among major producers. We’ve seen this playbook before—in 2014 and again in 2020—when Saudi Arabia and Russia opened the taps to undercut higher-cost rivals, particularly U.S. shale producers. 
Those episodes triggered sharp price declines, but OPEC+ was trying to reassert dominance in a market that had become increasingly influenced by American production growth. The strategy largely failed in 2014 (see OPEC’s Trillion Dollar Miscalculation), but it did squeeze out some overleveraged shale producers. 
At first glance, it seems self-defeating for OPEC+ to intentionally push prices lower. But history shows that short-term pain can yield long-term control. By tolerating lower prices for a period, OPEC+ can squeeze out marginal producers whose break-even costs are higher. Once those players scale back, the cartel can tighten supply again and reclaim pricing power.
This latest production increase comes at a time when U.S. output is at record levels, surpassing 13.7 million barrels per day. That resurgence reflects the flexibility of American shale—producers can ramp up quickly when prices rise and idle rigs just as fast when prices drop. This “elastic” supply has turned the United States into the de facto swing producer of the world.
However, that elasticity comes at a cost. Unlike OPEC+, which can coordinate cuts through collective agreements, U.S. producers act independently. When dozens of companies all respond to higher prices by drilling more wells, the collective impact is oversupply. The very efficiency that makes shale powerful also makes it self-defeating.
OPEC+ understands this dynamic. By modestly boosting output now, it’s signaling to the market that it won’t easily cede share to U.S. producers, even if that means tolerating prices closer to $75 per barrel rather than the $90 level that many members would prefer.
Physical barrels of oil aren’t the only factor at play. Prices are also shaped by expectations. In oil markets, perception moves faster than production.
If traders anticipate a surplus of even 500,000 to 600,000 barrels per day, prices will start adjusting long before those barrels appear. Futures markets incorporate everything from storage levels to exchange rates, creating an intricate web of feedback loops. When economic data points to weaker global demand, traders price that in immediately. Conversely, when a refinery fire breaks out in California or tensions flare in the Strait of Hormuz, prices can change overnight—even if global supply remains unchanged.
This is why oil markets can seem disconnected from fundamentals. They’re not just reflecting today’s balance of supply and demand, but the collective judgment of millions of traders trying to guess tomorrow’s.
Over the past decade, the rise of U.S. shale has permanently altered the energy landscape. Once, OPEC could shift prices with a simple announcement. Now, its influence is constrained by a U.S. industry that can respond more rapidly than any government-directed producer.
But the U.S. isn’t immune to pressure. Shale drilling depends heavily on capital discipline and investor confidence—both of which can erode quickly when oil falls below $70. That gives OPEC+ leverage. The group knows it can afford a period of lower prices longer than many U.S. independents can.
If Brent crude stabilizes in the $75–85 range, that’s a price OPEC+ can live with and one that still supports healthy refining margins for global majors. But if the expected surplus materializes, a slide below $60 isn’t out of the question. That would test the resilience of both producers and policy.
For consumers, this tug-of-war shows up at the pump. Gasoline prices generally track crude prices with a lag, so when oil slides, relief eventually filters through—though rarely as fast as it rises. For investors, understanding these dynamics is crucial. Energy stocks are among the most cyclical in the market, and they react more to forward price expectations than current spot prices.
In a world where oil is caught between economic uncertainty, OPEC+ maneuvering, and record U.S. production, volatility is the only constant. The smartest investors are the ones who understand the forces shaping the battlefield.
Oil remains a geopolitical currency as much as a commodity. And as long as both OPEC+ and U.S. shale producers continue to fight for influence, the market will remain what it’s always been: a high-stakes contest of patience, power, and price."

Sigma is a premier optics manufacturer. That is not just an opinion, it is becoming an unassailable fact. In the last several years, Sigma has cemented its reputation as one of the top optical manufacturers in the world. It is, therefore, becoming impossible to ignore that its lenses are not available on Z-mount. 
Author’s Note: Yes, I am aware that Sigma is allowed to make autofocus-equipped APS-C lenses for Nikon Z-mount, just as it is allowed to do so for Canon RF-mount. This conversation is focused on full-frame, autofocus-equipped lenses where Sony, Canon, and Nikon all have some level of roadblock up for third-party manufacturers (at varying levels of severity, from limiting FPS performance to outright blocking them). 
Neither Nikon nor Sigma was willing to speak about the relationship between Sigma and Z-mount on the record, which is unsurprising. On the one side, Sigma doesn’t want to upset any chance it might have of being accepted onto Z-mount, and on the other hand, Nikon is not going to reveal publicly if it is actively blocking Sigma, and if it is, provide any details as to why — that’s just not going to happen at this stage. Notwithstanding Japanese business customs, publicly traded companies just don’t share this kind of information lightly. The core of the following opinion is, therefore, based on off-the-record conversations with industry insiders as well as personal experience. 
There is a prevailing sentiment among photographers that it is Sigma that is deciding not to make lenses for Nikon Z-mount. We see it regularly in the comments on our Sigma lens reviews, and it’s some variation of, “why won’t Sigma release this for Z-mount,” or “can you ask Sigma why they won’t make this for Nikon cameras?”
Photographers are unfairly laying all of the blame on Sigma here. 

There is widespread knowledge that Canon blocks third-party lens manufacturers from releasing full-frame coverage lenses, probably because Canon itself went on the record to explain its stance.
“[T]he reason why we have not been collaborating or partnering with a third party is because of our business strategy. Our business strategy says that we are not going to partner with a third party. And the reason why we came up with that strategy is because of the business that we are doing. So our business is that if we have some technology, we try to lock it up inside our company and try to make a profit out of that. That’s the basis of our business,” Go Tokura, Senior Managing Executive Officer and Deputy Head of the Imaging Group at Canon, told PetaPixel last year. 
You may not like it, but it’s hard not to respect the transparency. But Nikon, a company that has fostered incredible goodwill with the photographic community since the launch of the Z9 and Z8, hasn’t gone on the record with why Sigma lenses aren’t on Z-mount, and seeing Tamron, Laowa, and Viltrox lenses on the platform makes it look to the average photographer that this is a Sigma decision.
I can tell you with absolute certainty that it is not Sigma’s choice. Stopping for even a moment to think about it, why would Sigma choose to not sell its lenses to more photographers? That just doesn’t make any sense. If it could make its full frame lenses available for Canon RF and Nikon Z cameras, it would. 

While the company wouldn’t go on the record to say as much, it has been made abundantly clear to me on multiple occasions over the last couple of years that Sigma desperately wants to make its lenses available on Z-mount — it’s just not being allowed to. 
I have my own suspicions as to why Sigma is being blocked, but since I haven’t been able to verify them, I’ll keep them to myself. All I can say is that it’s getting pretty hard to ignore Sigma’s exclusion, especially as other third-party brands are rapidly expanding onto the mount. 
Viltrox, in particular, is obviously hungry for market share. Not only are its most recent lenses excellent, they’re shockingly cheap. At the time of publication, Viltrox offers nine full-frame Z-mount lenses that are equipped with autofocus, and the most expensive option is the 135mm f/1.8 LAB lens at $899. Chris Niccolls actually prefers the design of the lower-end Pro series lenses, and there Viltrox has the 28mm f/1.8, the 24mm f/1.8, and the 85mm f/1.8 all available on Z-mount for under $400. 
If the fear was that Sigma is making products that are too close to native Nikon lenses, then it makes no sense for the Viltrox 85mm and 135mm lenses to be available. It would be a double standard.

No, there is something else at play here that is making Nikon specifically hold its hand out to stop Sigma from proceeding onto the Z-mount road while it waves Viltrox, Tamron, and Laowa through without even so much as a sideways glance. 
Unlike Canon and Sony, Nikon needs market share. Right now, Nikon is a distant third place behind both, and while one continues to block all autofocus-equipped third-party access, the other has allowed it for years. If Nikon wants to continue its excellent growth trajectory and ride the wave of positive public opinion, it needs to answer why Sigma — the most beloved, underdog lens manufacturer — isn’t welcome in its playground. 
Sigma isn’t allowed on Nikon Z-mount — a move that feels targeted and unfair — and photographers are going to have a hard time looking past that for much longer.

Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) reported third-quarter earnings of almost $30.8 billion, above the $26.3 billion in the same quarter of 2024, due to better operating profits and a larger gain in stocks. Operating earnings, which remove the distortion from market changes and better reflect the firm’s earnings power, rose by 34% for the quarter versus 2024. Per-share operating income decreased by 34% for the quarter, with no share repurchases over the past year. Warren Buffett leads Berkshire as CEO and Chairman with Greg Abel, Vice Chairman of Non-insurance, and Ajit Jain, Vice Chairman of Insurance.
Berkshire’s most significant business by operating earnings is insurance, followed by the manufacturing, service, and retailing (MSR) segment.
Insurance underwriting, the BNSF railroad, and the manufacturing, service & retail segment were the primary drivers behind the robust growth in operating earnings. Buffett noted at the annual meeting that Berkshire’s insurance earnings were as good as they get in 2024, so doing almost as well this year is an impressive result. Other income rose significantly, primarily due to accounting for foreign currency (FX) swings on Berkshire’s non-dollar borrowing. Excluding the FX impact on the “other” segment, operating earnings were 17% higher.
The two most essential concepts in insurance investing are “float” and underwriting profit. In simple terms, float is created for insurance companies because insurance premiums are paid before any claims are made by the insured. Insurance companies can invest the float, sometimes for years, before reimbursing insurance losses. Berkshire’s float is $5 billion higher than on December 31, 2024, at $176 billion. In general, the value of float increases as yields rise since an insurance company can earn more when investing the cash. Float per share was $122,373, above the $118,897 level at the end of 2024. Share repurchases did not aid float per share growth over the past year.
Significantly, policies in force at GEICO grew in the first three quarters of the year. Unlike many insurance companies, Berkshire has a history of earning underwriting profits, meaning its float costs nothing and generates income, allowing it to earn a profit from investing the float. Berkshire has three main insurance businesses: GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group, and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. All three had a profitable underwriting quarter. Underwriting profit is the positive difference between the insurance premium and all insurance claims and expenses. For example, GEICO had a combined ratio of 84.3% in the third quarter, meaning that only 84.3 cents of every dollar of insurance premiums was spent on losses and expenses. A combined ratio above 100% indicates that an insurance company has an underwriting loss.
For the third quarter of 2025, investment income was 13% below 2024, primarily due to lower short-term interest rates and capital distributions from Berkshire’s insurance subsidiary at the end of 2024.
Berkshire owns one of the largest railroads in North America, the Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) railroad, which operates in the US and Canada. Railroad freight volume improved modestly, and operating earnings rose about 5% versus the same quarter last year. On a positive note, BNSF continued to see improved productivity, which was the primary driver of this year’s earnings improvement. BNSF’s trailing 12-month operating ratio —operating expenses divided by revenue —continued to improve in the third quarter, demonstrating productivity gains. Berkshire has continued to make progress  after Buffett noted at the annual meeting that the “railroad is not earning what it should,” but is “getting solved.”
BHE should generally provide steady, growing earnings, as it primarily consists of regulated utilities and pipeline companies. In addition, BHE typically generates significant tax credits from its renewable energy generation. For this reason, Berkshire focuses on after-tax earnings, which is “how the energy businesses are managed and evaluated.”
BHE was negative on the headline numbers, with operating earnings falling 16.3% year over year. Berkshire set aside another $100 million in the third quarter of 2025 for wildfire loss accruals in its US utilities segment. Even excluding this accrual, the quarterly results were 10.6% below last year. The decrease in earnings from natural gas pipelines was primarily due to higher interest expense, lower margins, and lower other income. The other energy businesses saw earnings decline, primarily due to lower profits at Northern Powergrid.
Pretax earnings grew by 7.9% versus the same quarter last year. This segment comprises many diverse companies, so this analysis will focus on the best and worst performers and the themes within it.
Within the industrial segment, Marmon, “which consists of more than 100 autonomous manufacturing and service businesses, internally aggregated into twelve groups, and includes equipment leasing for the rail, intermodal tank container and mobile crane industries,” saw a 19.7% increase in pretax earnings. The improvement was primarily due to “Rail & Leasing, Transportation Products, Retail Solutions and Plumbing & Refrigeration groups.”
Elsewhere in the manufacturing segment, the building and consumer products groups accounted for further growth in pretax income. Within the building products segment, Clayton Homes reported higher revenue and pretax income due to “increases in financial services earnings.” Despite the better earnings in the building segment, Berkshire noted that some of their “building products businesses are experiencing slowing customer demand, as well as pricing pressures, attributable to prevailing general economic conditions and residential housing markets.” 
Unfortunately, the improvement in consumer sector earnings was due to the recognition of US tax credits rather than a fundamental business improvement. The decline in consumer products earnings was primarily due to Forest River, Fruit of the Loom, Jazwares, and Duracell, while Brooks Sports posted better earnings.
The service group saw a 19.2% increase in pretax earnings for the quarter, primarily attributable to the aviation services and TTI.
The retailing group reported lower pretax earnings, down 1.9% for the quarter. The most critical portion of the retailing segment is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive (BHA), which owns over 80 auto dealerships. BHA reported 1.8% higher earnings than in the third quarter of 2024. Pretax profits for the remainder of the retailing group declined by 22.7%, due primarily to “sluggish customer demand.”
Pilot Travel Centers (PTC) is the largest operator of travel centers in North America under the Pilot and Flying J brands. On January 16, 2024, Berkshire acquired the final 20% and now owns 100% of the entity. PTC’s pretax earnings decreased 107.8% due to “lower wholesale fuel and in-store gross margins and higher selling, general and administrative expenses.” McLane’s pretax earnings were 19.3% higher thanks to “increases in the overall gross margin rates, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses.”
This segment includes companies’ profits that must be accounted for under the equity method due to the size of ownership and influence on management. The after-tax equity method earnings have Berkshire’s proportionate share of profits attributable to its investments in Kraft Heinz (KHC), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), and Berkadia. Berkshire is Occidental Petroleum’s largest shareholder, with a 26.9% stake. More about the reasons for the Occidental investment is here.
The segment experienced a significant positive reversal in operating earnings for the quarter, primarily due to higher investment income and foreign currency exchange rate gains generated from bonds issued by Berkshire Hathaway and denominated in British Pounds, euros, and Japanese Yen. These foreign currency swings are not a concern as Berkshire has significant assets and earnings denominated in these foreign currencies. The interest income improved due to “increased investments in U.S. Treasury Bills, which derived largely from subsidiary dividends.” Investment gains from non-U.S. dollar investments generally offset some of these losses and vice versa, depending on currency exchange rates. Acquisition accounting expenses are also reflected in this segment. These expenses result from amortizing intangible assets associated with companies acquired by Berkshire. Finally, the loss in other earnings includes “unallocated general and administrative expenses, interest expense, income tax expense and interest income on certain intercompany loans.”
Berkshire’s insurance company investment portfolio is currently 51% publicly traded stocks, with 45% in cash.
Berkshire was a net seller of $6.1 billion in publicly traded stocks in the third quarter, the twelfth straight quarter of Berkshire Hathaway’s net sales of stocks. Berkshire bought $6.4 billion of stocks while selling $12.5 billion. The upcoming 13F filing on November 14 with the SEC will provide more specific buy and sell details, but a clue in the current filing points to possible further trimming of Berkshire’s Apple (AAPL) position.
Summary And Scorecard 
Berkshire’s stock price underperformed the S&P 500 in the third quarter, rising by 3.5% versus a total return of +8.1% from the S&P 500. Year-to-date through October 31, Berkshire’s price was +5.1%, while the S&P 500 had a total return of +12.3%.
Short-term results are generally not meaningful for Berkshire, which is managed with a focus on increasing long-term value rather than meeting quarterly hurdles. This ability to exploit time arbitrage has served the company and its shareholders well over the years. The goal in reviewing the results is to assess whether the segments are generally operating as expected and to consider Warren Buffett’s capital allocation decisions.
Previously, Buffett provided a handy blueprint for Berkshire’s management goals. The first goal would be to “increase operating earnings.” Secondly, success in the “decrease shares outstanding” goal would boost operating earnings per share faster. Lastly, “hope for an occasional big opportunity,” allowing for a sizable cash investment at an attractive expected return. This analysis will use Buffett’s blueprint as a lens through which to evaluate how Berkshire is performing.
Increase operating earnings: Trailing 12-month operating earnings were an impressive 17.9% higher than last year’s same quarter. Buffett says that operating earnings are the “most descriptive” way to view Berkshire, as they remove the short-term volatility of market fluctuations from net earnings.
Decrease shares outstanding: Particularly since 2018, a significant capital allocation decision has been made to increase share repurchases. When Berkshire Hathaway actively repurchases shares, it signals when Buffett believes its share price is below his intrinsic value estimate. If he is correct, the purchases are a value-creator for the remaining shareholders. Berkshire has stated that it would not repurchase stock if doing so would cause cash levels to fall below $30 billion, so the firm’s safety will not be compromised. Berkshire has not repurchased stock for the last six quarters.
Until an announcement in mid-2018, Berkshire had repurchased stock only when the stock traded at less than 1.2 times the price-to-book (P/B) ratio. While that constraint is now relaxed, it remains a good indicator of the general range of when aggressive repurchases are likely to occur. Berkshire’s price-to-book ratio remained elevated during the quarter, so share repurchases were suspended. Berkshire only intends to repurchase shares when the “repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined.” The price-to-book ratio remains a reasonable proxy for gauging Berkshire’s intrinsic value. The stock repurchases in the first quarter of 2024 were likely done at around 1.4 to 1.5 times book value. Berkshire’s stock traded between 1.5 and 1.64 times book in the third quarter, so it flirted with a level where some repurchases could be seen. With the recent decline in the shares, the valuation is nearing a level where repurchases might restart. Still, Warren Buffett’s judgment about its intrinsic value relative to other uses of capital can differ from the simple price-to-book ratio.
A longer-term view of the positive impact of Berkshire’s share repurchases is illuminating. Since the start of more aggressive share repurchases in 2018, Berkshire’s operating earnings have grown at a 17.0% compound growth rate, while operating earnings per share have done 2.1 percentage points better at 19.1%. Eagle-eyed readers might notice that operating earnings growth oddly exceeded operating earnings per share growth over the last year. Berkshire issued shares to purchase the remaining stake in Berkshire Hathaway Energy (BHE) in October 2024
Hope for an occasional big opportunity: Berkshire has a fortress balance sheet with cash and equivalents of $381.7 billion. Cash as a percentage of Berkshire Hathaway’s size is at the highest on record, at 31.1%. Though this analysis quotes the cash levels listed on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter, there was an accounts payable of $23.2 billion for the purchase of Treasury Bills, so the total cash should be considered to be slightly lower at $358.4 billion. In any case, the narrative remains unchanged. This cash hoard provides flexibility to take advantage of opportunities, including repurchasing its stock if the price declines to attractive levels.
Share repurchases had been off the table at the elevated valuations, but an additional lever for Buffett to create value might soon return. Shareholders should take comfort in knowing that the firm is well-positioned to withstand and emerge stronger from any tariff shocks, recession, or market downturn, thanks to its financial resilience, which enables it to capitalize on opportunities during a crisis.
On October 2, Berkshire announced the relatively small acquisition of OxyChem from Occidental Petroleum (OXY) for $9.7 billion.
Buffett announced at the end of the annual meeting in May that he planned to step down as CEO at the end of the year. Greg Abel will assume the CEO role and have the “final word on operations or capital deployment.” Notably, Buffett will remain Chairman to provide any needed guidance and intends to retain all his shares in the company. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Buffett will also turn over the authorship of the February annual letter to Greg Abel or take questions at the annual meeting in May. However, he plans to still publish his Thanksgiving letter on November 10.
Some are attributing the relative weakness in Berkshire’s share price to Buffett’s announcement of leaving the CEO role, but the proximate cause likely lies elsewhere. Investors flocked to Berkshire stock as a haven when the odds of recession soared with the tariff threat. As the fear of recession receded, some investors re-allocated to other stocks, and Berkshire’s valuation had become stretched in May.
Berkshire’s quarterly operating earnings soared year-over-year. While operating earnings were flattered by a significant foreign currency gain, even excluding that unsustainable tailwind, operating profits still grew by an impressive 17% year-over-year. Among the significant businesses, the only disappointment was Berkshire Hathaway Energy (BHE). For the third quarter, BHE accrued another $100 billion toward wildfire litigation and had a significantly lower income tax benefit. Insurance underwriting, the railroad, and the manufacturing, service & retail segment were the primary forces behind the better results. The manufacturing, service, and retailing segment was surprising, with 7.9% year-over-year operating earnings growth, primarily driven by the manufacturing businesses. The insurance underwriting results show that one of Berkshire’s crown jewels, GEICO, is back in profitable growth mode with policies in force continuing to rise.
